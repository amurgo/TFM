Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss A Viswanathan, Legal Representative from Camden
                    Community Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer






                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on  25  March  1974.    She
    seeks to appeal against the making of a deportation order  against  her
    under Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  The decision was dated
    23 August 2012.

2.   The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Taylor  sitting  with
    Mr P Bompas, non-legal member, on 17 December 2012.

3.   The appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

4.   Grounds of appeal were submitted against that decision,  the  focus  of
    which being that the Tribunal failed to pay full account to the medical
    and mental condition of the appellant, and failed  indeed  to  consider
    the case law relating to the same as it affected the  question  of  her
    removal from the jurisdiction.  In particular it was argued that  there
    had been a failure to make findings on the risk of  suicide  which  was
    central to the appellant's Article 3 claim.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted.

6.   Thus the matter  came  before  Upper  Tribunal  Peter  Lane  and  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Taylor in pursuance of that grant of  permission  on  21
    March 2013.   It was accepted by the respondent on that  occasion  that
    there had been errors of law in the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  In particular it was conceded that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    had not engaged with significant aspects of the  medical  evidence  nor
    with the judgment in J v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2005] EWCA Civ 629.

7.   Accordingly  the First-tier Tribunal determination was  set  aside  for
    the decision to be remade.  Directions were given for the rehearing. It
    was indicated that a Dr Vermeulen would be  giving  oral  evidence  and
    indeed it was indicated that the respondent was  expected  to  indicate
    her position in the light of the judicial review and of Dr  Vermeulen's
    report.

8.   That review was carried out and there  is  also  within  the  papers  a
    Supplementary  Reasons  for  Deportation  dated  9th   November   2013.
    Essentially it is the position of the respondent  that  notwithstanding
    the mental health of the appellant she can be returned to  Nigeria  and
    indeed ought to be returned.

9.    At  the  resumed  hearing  the  appellant  was  represented  by   Miss
    Viswanathan and the respondent represented by Mr Bramble,  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer.  I was presented with a skeleton argument on behalf
    of the appellant together with a bundle of documentation  of  some  250
    folios.  Although there had been a very substantial volume of documents
    that  had  been  presented  before  the   First-tier   Tribunal,   Miss
    Viswanathan indicated that she was relying to all intents and  purposes
    upon the documents in the  new bundle.

10.  It was indicated that the appellant was  unfit  to  give  evidence  and
    therefore did not attend.  Evidence was to be given by Dr Jan Vermeulen

11.  The immigration history of the appellant is somewhat complex and I  set
    it out briefly in this determination in an effort to put  the  evidence
    into its proper context.

12.  The appellant first arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  22nd  September
    1999 with a student visa which was  successively  renewed  until  2006.
    During that time she married a British citizen, Mr Mark David, in 2002.



13.  On 15th February 2006 she submitted an extension  application  for  her
    student visa which was refused.  Her appeal rights became exhausted  on
    20th March 2007.

14.  On 13th February 2007 the  appellant  submitted  another  student  visa
    application which was refused.  A subsequent appeal on that matter  was
    dismissed as was her application for judicial review.

15.  On 11th June 2009 the  appellant  was  convicted  of  three  counts  of
    dishonesty, making representations to make gain.  She was sentenced  to
    a total of two years' imprisonment. A psychiatric report  was  prepared
    in HMP Holloway by Dr Faisil Sethi.    It  was  his  opinion  that  the
    appellant was suffering from mental disorder.

16.  On completion of her sentence on  2nd  April  2010  the  appellant  was
    detained on immigration powers and was transferred to Yarl's  Wood  IRC
    on 2nd  June 2010.   She  was  assessed  by  Dr  Andrew  Whitehouse,  a
    consultant psychiatrist, during this  time.    On  1st  July  2010  the
    appellant's appeal against her deportation order was dismissed and  her
    appeal against that decision also dismissed by the Upper Tribunal.

17.  Following the instances of self-harm and  expressed  suicidal  thoughts
    the appellant was reviewed by  a  Dr  Balakrishna  in  September  2010.
    Seemingly her mental health had deteriorated whilst  in  detention  and
    the appellant made attempts to harm herself in detention.

18.  The appellant  then  made  an  asylum  claim  and  was  interviewed  in
    connection with  that  matter  on  7th  December  2010.   Dr  Koton,  a
    consultant psychiatrist, assessed the appellant in  December  2010  and
    found that she had obsessive compulsive features of extreme severity.

19.  The appellant's asylum claim was refused  and  certified  in  a  letter
    dated 17 February 2011.  On 16th March 2011 the appellant was  informed
    that she would be interviewed by the Nigerian High Commission  for  the
    purposes of redocumentation. She attempted suicide. Consequent  to  the
    suicide attempt and application was  made  to  revoke  the  deportation
    order on the basis that there was a real risk of  suicide  which  would
    lead to a breach of her rights under Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.  The
    respondent rejected those further submissions.

20.  In June 2011 the appellant was  assessed  at  Yarl's  Wood  by  another
    psychiatrist, a Dr Karnath.  He found there to be  an  ongoing  chronic
    illness quite likely to be a schizophrenic disorder into OCD.  She  had
    beliefs of paranoia  and  chronic  beliefs  of   delusional  intensity.
    Thereafter the appellant was seen by Dr Sagovsky and Dr Samuels.

21.  On 19 October 2011 the deportation order was revoked and the  appellant
    was transferred to Cygnet Hospital.  She  remained,  however,  detained
    pursuant to Section 32(5) of the  UK  Borders  Act  2007.    At  Cygnet
    Hospital the  appellant  was  transferred  to  Bedford  Hospital  as  a
    voluntary patient and then transferred back to Yarl's  Wood.   She  was
    released from immigration detention on 14 November 2011 to Barry  House
    where she underwent a community care assessment by the South London and
    Maudsley Mental Health Team. She has been supported by Southwark County
    Council under the National Assistance Act since December 2011.

22.  The appellant was notified by the respondent  that  she  is  liable  to
    automatic deportation under Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act and  it
    is this immigration decision  which  is  the  subject  of  the  current
    appeal.

23.  The issues which are highlighted for consideration in this  appeal  are
    essentially two fold.  The first  issue  relates  to  asylum  it  being
    contended that the appellant as a  mentally  ill  person  falls  within
    "social group" as defined in the leading case of  Forna.   It  is  said
    that the objective evidence is supportive for the proposition that were
    she to be returned to Nigeria she would be exposed to the risk of  ill-
    treatment because of the cultural approach to  those  who  have  mental
    illness and who may be considered to be possessed by spirits.

24.  The second issue relates to Article 3 of the ECHR  it  being  contended
    that the appellant's mental condition precludes  any  safe  return  and
    even if returned would suffer suicide or degradation.  Linked with that
    but clearly subsidiary to it  is  the  suggestion  that  Article  8  is
    engaged in any event.

25.  Dr Jan Vermeulen gave evidence, speaking  essentially  to  his  various
    reports of 12 March 2013, 14 March  2013,  27  September  2013  and  21
    January 2014.  He  is  a  consultant  in  general  adult  and  forensic
    psychiatry.

26.  He has seen the appellant on a number of occasions  both  in  detention
    and in her flat.

27.  His report of 12 March 2013 is the basic document  to  which  he  makes
    reference.  It is of considerable length.   It is  perhaps  unnecessary
    to set out in great detail that report.   It  highlights  a  number  of
    visits and also incorporates comments made by other  psychiatrists  who
    have seen the appellant.  It seeks to be a chronological history of her
    mental condition.

28.  It was his understanding from speaking to the appellant that  she  went
    to Nigeria in 1997/1998 and was involved in a traumatic bus accident in
    which some 30 people died.   It was the view of the  witness  that  the
    appellant had been suffering from mental disorder and particularly  OCD
    for a long time as a child.  To what extent the bus event had  worsened
    the effect of the obsessive compulsive condition of the  appellant  was
    far from clear. It was noted that some eighteen months after the  event
    in February 1999 the appellant attempted suicide and  was  admitted  to
    the  Emanuel  Mental  Hospital   found  to  be  suffering  from  mental
    disorder.  The OCD was a chronic condition that fluctuates depending on
    the nature of treatment that is given.  In his view the appellant would
    need some two years of sustained therapy and follow  up  procedures  in
    order  to  stabilise  her  condition  .    Although  he  made  such   a
    recommendation in his report of 12 March 2012, nothing  seems  to  have
    been done to facilitate  that  treatment  because  of  her  anxiety  or
    uncertainty as to her status in the United Kingdom.   It is clear  that
    the appellant does not wish to be detained  in  a  hospital  and  would
    respond adversely to any compulsory medical treatment order that  might
    be made.  He is however of the view  that  the  appellant  would,  with
    community support and an organised programme, respond well to that.  He
    speaks of the need for outpatient treatment and group therapy.

29.  Dr Vermeulen relies particularly upon his  most  recent  visit  to  the
    appellant as set out in his addendum report of 21st January  2014.   He
    interviewed the appellant for 30  minutes  at  her  residence  on  17th
    January 2014.   He has previously seen her on 8th February  2013,  15th
    February 2013, and 31 August 2013.  The new flat was cleaner  than  the
    previous flat but was dark and uncomfortably warm.   The appellant  was
    agitated and  speaking  rapidly  and  incoherently.   He  said  that  a
    constant feature of the appellant's mental  health  was  that  she  was
    obsessed with being  possessed  by  some  60  spirits.  Her  compulsive
    behaviour manifested itself in different ways over the period  that  he
    had known her and  was a way to try to  exorcise  those  spirits.   The
    appellant thought that meeting other people would mean they too  passed
    her their spirits.  On some occasions she has showered 60 times a  day,
    on others ten times and others  none  at  all.   she  has  however  her
    process of behaviour designed to control or exorcise such  spirit.   He
    describes her on the latest visit as wearing the same pink  track  suit
    she  was  wearing  on  previous  occasions.   She  was   also   wearing
    transparent gloves and overshoes.

30.  It was his opinion that there had been a significant  deterioration  in
    her mental state since 31 August 2013.  She has lost insight  and  held
    her beliefs with delusional intensity.  Her  speech  was  difficult  to
    follow and she was experiencing auditory and tactile hallucinations and
    experiencing delusional  persecution.   She  required  the  appropriate
    treatment for her condition.

31.  She had attempted suicide in the past, particularly when  in  detention
    and had cut herself in the past.  Without treatment he considered  that
    her chances of  accidentally  killing  herself  was  very  high  unless
    closely supervised.

32.  He was asked to comment upon the risk to the appellant were she  to  be
    detained with a view to removal.  He highlighted that the incidents  of
    attempted  suicide  and  self-harm  often  coincided  with  periods  of
    detention or compulsory treatment in hospital.  The appellant  did  not
    want to go to hospital because she felt that she would be detained.

33.  It was his view that she  would  require  some  form  of  restraint  to
    prevent her self-harming which may  mean  medication.  That  medication
    suppressing respiration may in itself be a risk  factor.   There  would
    need to be a careful balance between medication to calm  the  appellant
    down and restraint to prevent her harming herself.   It  is   his  view
    that that would be a difficult combination in the circumstances of  the
    appellant although not impossible.

34.  He  was  asked  about  what  would  happen  to  the  appellant  in  all
    probability were she to be returned to Nigeria. He said that he used to
    be  a  member  of  the  African  Psychiatric  Association  particularly
    involved with doctors from Zimbabwe.  There was considerable talent  in
    Nigeria and there would be very competent doctors in Nigeria  to  treat
    the mental problems of the appellant.

35.  The central issue was whether or not  she  would  be  able  access  the
    level of treatment that she required to prevent self-harm and  suicide.
    He said that the level of treatment for  OCD  was  generally  lower  in
    Nigeria simply because of less availability of treatment.

36.  He indicated that he had interviewed  the  appellant  for  considerable
    periods of time over a fairly lengthy period, some ten hours in  total.
    He said that he was able to make a proper assessment as to  her  mental
    condition.  He said that the subsequent history was consistent with her
    having experienced the trauma of the bus accident although that had not
    been independently  verified  as  having  taken  place.   Generally  he
    assumes that patients are telling him the truth.

37.  As to the suicide attempt in 1999, Dr Vermeulen agreed that  that  came
    from the account of the appellant  herself.   In  that  connection  his
    attention was drawn to the report prepared by Andrew Whitehouse arising
    from his visit to the appellant in Yarl's Wood on 16th  July  2009  and
    29th July 2009.   In  that  report  it  was  noted  that  although  the
    appellant had suffered in the past with panic  attacks  she  had  never
    tried to harm herself or tried to harm  others.  He  repeated  that  he
    could only rely upon that evidence  which  was  given  to  him  by  the
    appellant.

38.  Dr Vermeulen was referred to his report  and  to  the  events  in  June
    2011.  These were notes based upon the accounts of  other  doctors  who
    had visited the appellant, particularly when she had  been  taken  into
    custody in Yarl's Wood.  She was depressed and self-harming and said to
    have suicidal ideation. She needed treatment but was refusing  it.   In
    August of that year she was noticed biting  and  chewing  her  arm  and
    claimed to have swallowed a sharp nail in  October  2011  and  went  to
    hospital for investigation.  A possible suicide attempt  was  noted  in
    the  incident report of 16 March 2011 where a ligature  would  seem  to
    have been  tied around her neck in the bathroom.  The point is made  in
    the report of Professor Koton of 15th December 2010 which  referred  to
    cutting and her wish to throw herself down  the  staircase.   It  noted
    that whilst in Yarl's Wood  her  behaviour  was  becoming  increasingly
    unmanageable.  Dr Vermeulen agreed that according to his detailed notes
    that was the last incident of  attempted  suicide  and  that  the  last
    occasion of self-harm was in Barry House in 2011.

39.  Dr Vermeulen  indicated  that  her  anxiety  would  increase  with  any
    attempts to detain  or  remove  her  and  she  would  require  constant
    monitoring to protect her from herself  and  self-harm.   He  indicated
    that with treatment and particularly cognitive  therapy  the  appellant
    has always responded well and her condition has improved.  He  sees  no
    reason  why  with  the  proper  cognitive  treatment  the   appellant's
    condition could not improve.  Conversely however any attempt to  remove
    her would aggravate her situation.

40.  He repeated that her condition would seem to have  deteriorated.   When
    she had gone out to buy groceries on one occasion she was mugged and so
    had not left the flat since 2012.  When he had seen her  in  March  she
    had lived in a flat in dirty conditions, she fearing to shower.  On the
    last occasion she was clean, she having been  able  to  shower,  indeed
    showers ten times a day.  Nevertheless she continues with her obsessive
    thoughts, particularly of the evil spirits and her fear  of  using  the
    toilet itself.

41   He spoke of the fluctuation in her chronic condition. It  would  always
    be there but could be controlled and indeed there would be  times  when
    she could be  well  enough  to  organise  her  own  events.   Cognitive
    behaviour  therapy  would  assist  her  in  managing  her   moods   and
    controlling her obsessive thoughts and delusions.  It was the anxieties
    that she had with her spirits and with the ongoing court  process  that
    has contributed to her condition.   He agreed with Mr Bramble that  she
    could be removed but that would require careful management.   There  is
    no reason at all why, with support, she could not access proper medical
    treatment in Nigeria, the difficulty being whether she would be able to
    manage herself in that context.   He agreed that her behaviour was very
    odd and had always been  very odd particularly the ways  in  which  she
    dressed and expressed herself.

42.  The parties made their submissions to me.

43.  In terms of asylum, Miss Viswanathan makes it clear that the basis  for
    the current claim of  the  appellant's  mental  condition  being  of  a
    permanent  nature such that she falls to be considered as a member of a
    social group within the authority of SSHD v Gay and Fornah [2009]  UKHL
    46.  Essentially it is submitted that by reason of her mental condition
    she will be viewed as an outcast and ill-treated accordingly.  Reliance
    is placed upon the report of  Mario  Aguiller  of  28th  November  2012
    together with other country documents.   It was  acknowledged  that  at
    the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal asylum was  also  raised  on
    the grounds of the appellant's sexuality.  That is not  however  to  be
    proceeded with, particularly as it was certified under Section 72.

44.  Mr Bramble invites me to be  slow  to  find  credibility  in  what  the
    appellant herself has to  say  about  her  experiences  in  the  United
    Kingdom or in Nigeria.  He invites  my  attention  to  her  immigration
    history. He submits that I should be slow to accept any credibility  of
    the appellant  unless  verified  by  other  independent  evidence.   He
    invites me to place little weight upon the expert  country  report  and
    submits that the issue of witchcraft and evil spirits is not  one  that
    arises in any practical sense because the appellant will have a  family
    support or network to return to.  He asks me to consider that  as  part
    of the offending behaviour the appellant had sent  some  �31,000  to  a
    bank account in Nigeria.  He invites me to find that is  evidence  that
    the appellant has maintained connections in Nigeria.

45.  On the second issue of Articles 2 and 3 Miss Viswanathan invites me  to
    find that, given the mental history of the  appellant  and  indeed  its
    deterioration over recent years,  there would be a high risk of suicide
    within the process of removal let alone upon removal.  She  invites  me
    to find that argument advanced on behalf of  the  respondent  that  the
    appellant has family simply because she has funds in  a  Nigerian  bank
    account that is speculative in the extreme.  She  invites  me  to  find
    that without family support the appellant will be unable to manage  her
    condition and lacks  insight into  it  such  that  her  condition  will
    further deteriorate, leading to suicide and self-harm.

46.  The starting point for the order for deportation lies clearly with  the
    nature of the appellant's offending.  It is unnecessary to  analyse  in
    great detail the public interest in removal as that is clearly  assumed
    and marked by the legislature in the statutory framework.

47.  The offences for which  the  appellant  was  sentenced  to  two  years'
    imprisonment at the Crown Court on 13 August 2009 were three counts  of
    dishonesty and false representation.  In the  sentencing  remarks,  the
    judge stated that the appellant was not  authorised  by  the  Financial
    Services Authority and was very well aware that what she was doing  was
    thoroughly dishonest.  It was found that the appellant had  transferred
    �31,000 abroad and that there were passports in her flat  belonging  to
    other people.  She was involved in a complex and  sophisticated  series
    of frauds causing substantial loss in respect of each victim.

48.  In his sentencing remarks the judge considered that the  appellant  was
    manipulative and persuasive and was using  false  documents  knowingly.
    The first count was a fraud of �9,700 on the University of  Westminster
    with the use of fraudulent documents to deceive the university  finance
    department on  financial  matters.    The  second  count  involved  the
    appellant's false claim that she had set up an  investment  scheme  and
    persuading a victim to invest �9,375  in  the  same.  The  third  count
    involved a property letting company causing a loss to  the  company  of
    �20,000.   The appellant had intended to sub-rent the flats  which  she
    had falsely obtained from the letting company.  She had  been  arrested
    and bailed but following her absconding she was rearrested.  The  judge
    found the appellant to be an intelligent person and considered that the
    appellant probably had obsessive compulsory disorder  but  that  played
    little part in the offences.

49.  It is to be noted that prior to her offending behaviour  the  appellant
    was a student, having obtained a degree in the course of her studies.

50.  The earliest medical report which seems to be relied upon  is  that  of
    Dr Johannes Mousa dated 19th July 1999 from the hospital in Addis Ababa
    in Ethiopia.  According to the author of the report he was asked by the
    mother of the appellant to conduct a  psychiatric  examination  of  her
    daughter.  Reference is made  in  that  report  to  the  fact  that  in
    February 1989 she had been taken to hospital after an attempt to commit
    suicide using a rope in her mother's home.  Reference is  made  to  the
    event in 1998 involving the accident with the vehicle in  which  people
    were killed. Reliance is  placed  upon  that  so-called  first  suicide
    attempt but has been indicated  when  the  appellant  was  seen  by  Dr
    Whitehouse he makes no mention of that previous attempt.

51.   The  recommendation  of  Dr  Mousa  was  that  the  appellant   showed
    variations in her temperament and should be in a mental institution for
    the rest of her life as she was affected not just by a single  disorder
    of  schizophrenia,  diverse  gender  personality  but   self-harm   and
    compulsive suicidal influences.  Notwithstanding that  rather  dramatic
    conclusion the appellant was not detained in a mental  institution  and
    for many years thereafter managed to live a relatively normal life as a
    student and as an  individual  both  in  Ethiopia  and  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Significantly for her offending, she knew what she was  doing
    and was manipulative and sophisticated in that which she undertook.

52.  Thus there have been long periods in the life of  the  appellant  where
    she has lived her own life and monitored her own affairs and  monitored
    her behaviour.

53.  It is significant that the majority of  the  many  psychiatric  reports
    that have been prepared upon the appellant postdate her  offending  and
    detention, with no offending and arise whilst she is in detention.

54.  I do not set out in detail the report of Dr  Vermeulen  who  in  effect
    summarises the various reports that have been prepared on behalf of the
    appellant.  There is for example a visit recorded in May 2010 in  which
    the comment is made that the appellant is very articulate and  able  to
    communicate well.   She is not presenting with any  psychotic  features
    despite hearing and seeing spirits.   A month later there is  an  entry
    that she is very uncooperative and expresses  suicidal  thoughts.    In
    June 2010 she declines medication or counselling.  In  July  there  are
    two occasions of attempted self-harm  at  HMP  Bromsfield.   In  August
    medication is discussed and a care plan developed.  In  September  2010
    there are reports that she attempted to drop herself from  the  top  of
    the stairs and tried to tie her neck with a mobile phone charger  cord.
    She was tearful and stated that somebody had upset her.  In March  2011
    when she was due to go Colnbrook for her immigration interview she  was
    found on the floor of the bathroom with a  ligature  around  her  neck.
    Thereafter there are a few incidents of self-harm.  Dr Kanath  believes
    that her detention is detrimental to  her  mental  health.   Thereafter
    follows several more incidents of self-harm.

55.  Most of those who have observed the  appellant  comment  that  although
    she suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder she would  benefit  from
    the care of a consultant psychiatrist and mental health team.  When she
    was seen on 17 November 2011 she had deteriorated to such an extent  in
    custody that Dr Kanath  considered  that  she  should  be  admitted  to
    hospital.  She was sent to Barry House where she seemed  to  self-harm.
    She was thereafter admitted to the Jim Birley Unit in October  2012  as
    an informal patient. A Mental Heath Assessment took place on 5  October
    2012. She agreed to remain voluntarily on the  ward  and  continued  to
    improve and was discharged on 18 October 2012.  It  was  noted  shortly
    before discharge that the appellant appeared  well  presented  with  no
    evidence of self neglect.

56.  Without attempting a detailed analysis of all the medical  reports,  it
    seems to be common ground and I so find that the appellant's  condition
    is chronic in that it will never be removed from  her  personality  but
    varies  as  to  its  nature  and  effect.  Part  of  the   process   of
    stabilisation is  to  enable  the  appellant  to  have  access  to  the
    appropriate medication, to the support of the mental  health  team  and
    in particular to the therapy.  It is the view of Dr Vermeulen as I have
    indicated that she  responds  well  to  such  matters.  The  difficulty
    present is that her condition has deteriorated simply because  none  of
    these facilities have been  made open to her given the  uncertainty  of
    her status and position.

57.  It seems to me that that is an important consideration in  the  overall
    context of this particular case.  The appellant  is  not  somebody  who
    lacks insight into her condition or the ability to run her own life and
    affairs.  She has demonstrated both as a student and  by  her  criminal
    conduct that she can organise herself and plan  a  clear  and  coherent
    outline for her living. She has managed  her life with  society  albeit
    with the underling medical and mental conditions which she  has.    She
    is not somebody therefore that has  lost  permanent  insight  into  her
    condition or has demonstrated that she is incapable of managing her own
    affairs.  Rather it is clear, I so find, that she knows very  much  her
    own mind and that her moods vary very much  according  to  whether  she
    feels under pressure or under threat.

58.  It may well be therefore that were the  appellant  to  have  access  in
    Nigeria to proper medication and support  her condition would  be  such
    that she could manage her own affairs.

59.  To some extent that may well  depend  upon  what  family  or  community
    support she would be able to call upon and/or what  support  she  could
    obtain through her financial security having some �31,000 in a Nigerian
    bank and also some  �40,000 by way of compensation from the  government
    for her detention.

60.  The burden of the claim for asylum  is  not  so  much  the  appellant's
    ability to manage her health but rather  the  perception  that  society
    would have of her as a  mentally  disturbed  individual.   Reliance  is
    therefore placed  heavily upon the report of Mario  Aguiller  dated  28
    November 2012.  Professor Aguiller  sets  out  his  qualifications,  in
    particular his academic qualifications in  socio-anthropology.   It  is
    far from clear from his report what direct experience he has of life in
    Nigeria. He makes reference to the World Health  Organisation's  Report
    on Nigeria and various medical studies  conducted  and  set  out  on  a
    website or internet.  To what extent  his report  is  from  his  direct
    experience and how much is from research is far from clear.

61.  In his report he states that it is clear from the objective  data  that
    Nigeria struggles to provide basic medical treatment  to  its  citizens
    and is struggling to contain major illnesses such as diabetes,  TB  and
    HIV.  The national health system of  Nigeria  does  not  have  adequate
    provisions for mental health treatment or prevention of suicide or long
    term treatment of the seriously mentally ill.   Despite  that  somewhat
    sweeping statement Professor Aguiller does not give any source material
    for those contentions.  It somewhat conflicts with the evidence  of  Dr
    Vermeulen who speaks of a considerable degree of expertise  within  the
    country of Nigeria.

62.  According to Professor Aguiller signs of mental illness are  culturally
    associated with witchcraft and evil spirits and  thus  Nigerians  would
    avoid or reject with violence people with  serious  mental  illness  in
    public.  Once again that is a sweeping comment ,that seems to be little
    reference to source material.  No distinction seems to be made  between
    the city conurbations and the rural village areas.  The report deals at
    length with the concept of  witchcraft  and  evil  spirits  in  a  more
    general way.

63.  He comments at paragraph 20 of his report that people in  Nigeria  need
    to have money in order  to  pay  for  medication.   He  says  that  the
    appellant will have no access to medication if she cannot  pay  for  it
    and will have no ability of long term care or  any  scheme  that  would
    prevent her intended suicide.  Once again that is a sweeping  statement
    without any particular foundation or support for it.  In this case,  of
    course, the reverse is true.  Far from being impecunious the  appellant
    has  a  very  substantial  fund  available  to  her  both  to  purchase
    medication and also no doubt to purchase care facilities if need be.

64.  I place little weight upon the evidence of Professor  Aguiller  because
    of the lack of balance, as I observe it, and for the  unsourced  nature
    of the statements.  Nigeria is an extremely large country, diverse both
    into its culture and into its religions.  The report seems to  make  no
    acknowledgment of that fact nor seek  to  be  more  particular  in  its
    terms.

65.  Mr Bramble by contrast  invites  my  attention  to  the  COIS  Nigerian
    Country Report dated June 2013, an extract which has been  produced  in
    support of the references made to it in the Supplementary  Reasons  For
    Deportation set out on 9 November 2013.    Reference  is  made  to  the
    inadequacy of the health care delivery system  as  attributed  out  the
    particular democratics of the population.  45% of the  population  live
    in urban areas and 55% live in rural areas only.  It is said  that  70%
    of the health care is provided by private vendors and only 30%  by  the
    government.  It speaks of the fact that over  half  of  the  population
    live below the poverty line on less than $1 per day and  cannot  afford
    the high cost of health care.

66.  There are however three levels  of  health  care.  There  are  teaching
    hospitals and specialist hospitals and  the  federal  government  works
    with  voluntary  and  non-governmental   organisations   as   well   as
    practitioners.  The statistics show that health institutions  rendering
    health care in  Nigeria  are  over  33,000  general  hospitals,  20,000
    primary health centres and  posts  and  59  teaching  hospitals.   That
    represents a huge improvement over the last few decades although  there
    is still a shortage.

67.  In private hospitals some  have  adequate  equipment  and  others  not.
    They are accessible to anyone who can  afford  their  services.   Drugs
    also are available but may be  expensive.   The  private  hospitals  in
    Nigeria provide a higher standard of medical care  than  public  sector
    hospitals. The report speaks about the providers of medicine and of the
    various treatments that are available.

68.  As to mental health, it is noted that  an  officially  approved  mental
    health  policy  exists.  I  areas  of  Nigeria  there  is   a   limited
    availability of mental health services   but   available  services  are
    often under utilised because of widespread ignorance  and  supernatural
    beliefs about the origin of mental illness.  Care is  provided  at  the
    very large mental health hospitals  in  big  cities.  Nigeria's  mental
    health  facilities  consist  of  eight  federally  funded   psychiatric
    hospitals and six state owned mental  hospitals.

69.  Although that report makes it clear that there is much to do  in  terms
    of mental heath it does not seek to paint the more negative picture  as
    painted by Professor Aguiller in his report.

70.  Miss Viswanthan in her skeleton argument cites  the  COI  report  dated
    January 2012 indicating that studies have found that only 10% of  those
    with severe mental  illnesses like  schizophrenia  received  treatment.
    The majority of the expensive care is paid by parents and families. The
    submission as advanced in the skeleton argument in that  the  appellant
    would require long term treatment and have to fund it and that she  has
    no access to funds because she  is  incapable  of  working  to  support
    herself and has  no  family.  Quite  the  contrary,  I  find  that  the
    appellant has very substantial funds to which she may have access.

71.  The only direct evidence as to family members  or  support  in  Nigeria
    comes from the appellant's screening interview of 7 December 2010.   In
    it she indicates that her mother is  deceased  and  her  father  is  in
    Bauchi State.  Four stepsisters are named. It is said that they are  in
    the United Kingdom as is one stepbrother.  According to  the  appellant
    she has little to do with them and does not know their whereabouts.  Mr
    Bramble invites me to  find  that  because  the  appellant  transferred
    �31,000 to an account in Nigeria that indicates  that  she  has  family
    there.  Miss Viswanathan submits that is but speculation.  There is  no
    reason at all why the money could not have been  put into  her  account
    in order to be used for further fraudulent activities.   In  any  event
    there was no evidence about that bank account or  of  the  money  other
    than that it was originally transferred. She submits that in  returning
    the  appellant   of  a  venerable  mental  situation,   it   is   quite
    inappropriate  to speculate on family members.  I find  that  there  is
    merit in that submission.  However with the finances available  to  the
    appellant I find that she would be well able to access the support that
    she requires. It is clear and I so find that with treatment she will be
    able to both recognise her own condition and  to    access  appropriate
    treatment.

72.  That having been said, it is entirely  apparent  that  at  present  the
    appellant has little insight into her condition and  requires  external
    support in order to cope outside the narrow confines of her  room.   It
    would either involve obtaining suitable treatment in the United Kingdom
    or identifying with some particularity  where  that  treatment  can  be
    accessed in Nigeria.

73.  As to the issue of stigmatisation, I bear in mind  also  the  documents
    relied upon by the appellant in the bundle particularly those at  pages
    187 to 204 thereof.

74.  I bear in mind the community study knowledge of and attitude to  mental
    illness in Nigeria which seems to be  a  survey  largely  conducted  in
    south western Nigeria with some 240,000 persons  participating  in  the
    survey on stigma.  How far they are  representative  of  that  area  in
    particular or of Nigeria as a whole is perhaps less clear.  The  report
    perhaps reveals a wide ignorance as to mental illness  indicating  that
    most of those spoken to were unwilling to have social interaction  with
    some with mental illness being perhaps a more liberal attitude in urban
    areas. Such report is not supportive of the suggestion that is implicit
    within the asylum claim that the appellant would  be  exposed  to  open
    hostility or violence. That she might find it  difficult  to  establish
    social  contact  with  people  is  of  course  a  relevant  factor   in
    considering the reasonableness of  return  but  equally  it  is  to  be
    recognised that a lack of social  contact  is  her  experience  in  the
    United Kingdom and indeed is an unfortunate consequence of her illness.
     She is reclusive in the United  Kingdom  and  it  does  not  necessary
    follow that being reclusive in Nigeria would necessarily  be  otherwise
    than an outward expression of  her  inward  illness  and  not  as  such
    therefore undermining of her fundamental human rights.   The example of
    the medicine man is particularly unhelpful as  it  is  by  no  means  a
    requirement that the appellant visit such  a  person.  In  effect  much
    comes to the issue of what support mechanism would be available to  the
    appellant were to return.

75.  I turn to consider perhaps the wider  issue  that  of  the  appellant's
    general mental health and of the risk and likelihood  of  suicide  upon
    transportation to Nigeria and return thereto. In that connection I bear
    in mind the decision of J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629.

76.  The structure for considering foreign cases is set  out  in  paragraphs
    25 to 32 of the judgment. I recognise in particular that in the context
    of a forgiven case the Article 3 threshold is particularly high.

77.  In considering the appellant's current mental health  and  the  current
    risk of suicide or of self-harm it is significant to note that the last
    incident complained of was that in custody in 2011.  Much  is  made  of
    the previous incident the subject of Dr Musa's report as establishing a
    higher category of suicide risk so far as the appellant  is  concerned.
    That was, however,  a  date  very  far  into  the  early  life  of  the
    appellant.

78.  I bear in mind the evidence of the various doctors that have  seen  the
    appellant and particularly that  of  Dr  Vermeulen  who  has  seen  her
    perhaps more consistently out of a detention context.  His view is that
    she requires treatment which she is not having and  that  certainly  in
    the  last  few  visits  her  delusional  thoughts  are  very   strongly
    expressed.  Notwithstanding however the lack of treatment, which in his
    view is required in order to stabilise or assist the  condition,  there
    is no suggestion that she has self-harmed or sought to commit  suicide.
    Thus although it may well be right to  note that without treatment that
    risk increases in practical terms, there has been no such attempt since
    2011 albeit that her condition  has  significantly  deteriorated  since
    then. I find therefore that in general terms the suicide risk, even for
    a condition which is  untreated,  is  in  practical  terms  a  low  one
    notwithstanding the comments made by the various medical reports.

79.  I find therefore that a general risk  of  suicide  is  not  objectively
    well-founded .

80.  However, as is required in the case of J, I must consider  whether  the
    removing and/or receiving state has effective mechanisms to reduce  the
    risk of suicide.   It  is  apparent  from  the  reports  that  when  in
    detention or custody the risk of suicide is much greater as is also the
    risk of self-harm.   A number of examples were given at or around  2011
    to substantiate that risk.  I find, therefore, that  it  is  reasonably
    likely that were the appellant to be taken into custody with a view  to
    removal  her suicide risk would significantly increase. As Dr Vermeulen
    recognised,  there  would  therefore  need  to  be  a  balance  between
    restraint and medication. He does not view that  as  being  impractical
    but advises care in the balance that has to be adopted.  Those  seeking
    to restrain the appellant will of course need to be very  much  on  the
    alert for the incidents of self-harm and/or  attempted  suicide.  Those
    risks were managed and monitored on previous occasions and I find  that
    the removing state would have effective mechanisms to reduce  the  risk
    of suicide and self-harm.

81.  I have, therefore, to consider what would be the suicide risk were  the
    appellant to arrive in Nigeria. It seems to me that the nature  of  the
    risk is a function upon what support  is  available  to  the  appellant
    either through family and friends or though an agency or hospital. As I
    have indicated before, isolation from  the  community  may  not  be  as
    significant a  feature,  particularly  as  that  isolation  is  already
    present in her life in the United Kingdom.    I do  not  find  that  it
    would be necessary for her to be  restrained  in  hospital  or  closely
    monitored. It does not happen in the United  Kingdom  and,  as  I  have
    indicated,  there  is  no  suggestion  that  suicide  is   the   likely
    consequence from that.   Clearly,  however,  were  she  to  deteriorate
    further into delusion then such risk on all the medical evidence  could
    not be excluded.  As Dr  Vermeulen  has  indicated,  cognitive  therapy
    would be of  great  assistance  to  the  appellant  both  in  terms  of
    recognising her behaviour and doing something certainly to modify it or
    to handle her condition. At present it would seem  that  she  had  very
    little insight into her own delusions.  There  therefore  needs  to  be
    some support in place upon her arrival in Nigeria for the appellant  to
    access reasonable treatment or assistance in monitoring her condition.

82.  As was made clear by the respondent in the  Supplementary  Reasons  for
    Deportation of 9 November 2013, on her deportation to Nigeria she would
    be escorted by a doctor and appropriate medical escorts and in  Nigeria
    she  could  continue  her  residence  with  the   appropriate   medical
    treatment.  I have noted that the appellant has family who remained  in
    Nigeria, namely her father, four  stepsisters  and  one  stepbrother  .
    Whether or not they would be in a position  to  assist  or  willing  to
    assist cannot be determined with accuracy at this  time.   Nevertheless
    it is clear, and I so find from the objective material  provided,  that
    suitable treatment for the appellant is available in Nigeria  and  that
    she would have access to that treatment given her significant financial
    means.

83.  I recognise in fairness to  the  appellant,  however,  that  given  her
    current situation of delusion and bizarre behaviour,  it  is  far  from
    clear as to whether or not she would have a sufficient cognitive  grasp
    of reality to effectively manage those finances. Nevertheless were  her
    condition to be stabilised I see no  difficulty  in  her  managing  her
    financial affairs. The significance of her offending behaviour in  2009
    is indicative of a  high degree of financial management skills that she
    was able to employ in establishing her affairs albeit  in  a  dishonest
    way.  '

84.  Applying therefore such findings as the issues as originally raised  in
    the course of the appeal, I turn firstly to that of asylum.   Even were
    it to be accepted that as a mentally ill  person  the  appellant  could
    fall within a particular social group I do not find,  for  the  reasons
    that I have already set out ,that she would face a real  of  injury  or
    violence or depravity were she to be returned  to  Nigeria.  Even  were
    there to be some degree of social  avoidance  such  is  her  experience
    generally in  her  lifestyle  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Although  her
    behaviour may remain somewhat odd, proper treatment would better enable
    her to meet people and have some normality of life.  I do not find that
    the societal attitude towards witchcraft and of evil spirits  would  be
    such as to manifest itself in persecutory conduct towards the appellant
    as envisaged either  within  the  Geneva  Convention  1951  or  in  the
    Immigration Rules. She would have the support of family or of a  caring
    agency whose services she could pay for. Her odd behaviour may lead  to
    people  avoiding  her  but  I  find  little  evidence  to  support  the
    proposition that they would attack her or ill treat her.

85.   So far as Articles  2  and  3  are  concerned,  I  bear  in  mind  the
    jurisprudence set out not only in J but also in GS and EO (Article 3  -
    health cases) India [2012] UKUT  397.  I  do  not  find  that  evidence
    establishes any such aggravation of mental suffering of  the  intensity
    as seen in Soering were the appellant to be returned.  I find that  she
    would have proper access to suitable medical treatment.   If,  however,
    the appellant were to be returned in her current situation, it would be
    incumbent upon those seeking  to  return  her  to  establish  that  the
    mechanism of proper support appropriate to her needs would be available
    upon arrival in Nigeria.

86.   Aside  from  the  issue  of  suicide  risk,  I   also   consider   the
    proportionality overall as to the return of the  appellant  bearing  in
    mind her fundamental human rights.

87.  In all the circumstances I find  that  the  overriding  balance  is  to
    preserve the public interest bearing in mind SS (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 550 and the need to express society's disapproval of  the  sort  of
    offending behaviour as demonstrated by the  appellant.    Although  the
    overall risk to her reoffending has been stated as being  low,  I  find
    that overall her removal is proportionate to  the  public  interest  in
    this case.

88.  I bear in mind also paragraphs 398, 399(b), 399A, noting in  particular
    that if  paragraph  398(c)  does  not  succeed  it  would  only  be  in
    exceptional circumstances that the public interest will be  outweighed.
    I bear in mind MF (Nigeria) also in that context.

89.  I do not find there to be any such exceptional  circumstances  in  this
    case. Her private life is very much confined by her illness  and  there
    are no wider family or social connections relied upon.  The  nature  of
    her relationship with her husband was considered by the Tribunal  on  a
    previous occasion and it is not a matter relied on in this appeal  I do
    not find that the appellant will  face  persecution  for  a  Convention
    reason upon return.  I find that with  proper  medical  assistance  her
    mental condition can be stabilised and/or improved such that she is not
    of harm to herself or to others. She can regain a  significant  element
    of her private life in Nigeria. I do not find any significant reduction
    in the quality of life that she would enjoy in UK  with  treatment  and
    that in Nigeria.  I  find  that  it  is  proportionate  to  remove  the
    appellant, subject of course to the safeguards as  to  the  process  of
    removal and the obtaining of support in Nigeria.


90.  In all the  circumstances  therefore  the  appeal  in  respect  of  the
    immigration decision is  dismissed.   That  in  respect  of  asylum  is
    dismissed.  That in respect of Articles 2, 3 and 8 is also dismissed.
