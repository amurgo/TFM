Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr G Rea, Maguire Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against  a  decision  by
   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Morrison  allowing  an  appeal  by  Mrs
   Jelena Pavlovic (hereinafter referred to as "the claimant").

2) The underlying facts of this appeal were carefully set out by  the  Judge
   of the First-tier Tribunal.  The claimant is a  citizen  of  Serbia.   In
   March 2013 she applied for entry clearance as the  spouse  of  Aleksander
   Pavlovic, who has dual Serbian and British nationality.  The  application
   was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on the basis that the  sponsor
   could not meet  the  maintenance  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
   Immigration Rules.

3) On 10 April 2015, following the hearing but before our determination  was
   promulgated, the claimant wrote to the Upper Tribunal  stating  that  she
   wished to withdraw her appeal.  She and her daughter, who  is  a  British
   citizen, were living in Serbia while her husband was living  in  the  UK.
   The claimant's daughter is of an age to  start  school  and  her  parents
   would like her to start school in the UK in  August  2015.   Accordingly,
   the claimant was seeking to withdraw the appeal in order to  apply  again
   for a visa as a spouse.

4) Under rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  a
   party may give notice to the Upper Tribunal of withdrawal of his  or  her
   case.  Notice of withdrawal will not  take  effect  unless  the  Tribunal
   consents to the withdrawal.

5) In this case the appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  made  by  the  Entry
   Clearance Officer after the claimant was successful in her appeal to  the
   First-tier Tribunal.  Accordingly the request by the claimant to withdraw
   her appeal will not have the effect of  halting  proceedings  before  the
   Upper Tribunal.  The only effect that the claimant's withdrawal can have,
   if the Tribunal consents to withdrawal, is that the  claimant  no  longer
   seeks to contest the proceedings  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.   In  the
   circumstances we are satisfied that this was the clear intention  of  the
   claimant's letter of withdrawal.

6) We therefore consent to the claimant  withdrawing  her  case  before  the
   Upper Tribunal.  The effect of this will be that the appeal by the  Entry
   Clearance Officer against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal will be
   unopposed.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal will be set aside and
   the decision re-made, with the result that the claimant's appeal  against
   the refusal  decision  made  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  will  be
   dismissed.

7)  We should at this stage point out that even  if  the  claimant  had  not
   withdrawn her case,  we  would  have  decided  in  favour  of  the  Entry
   Clearance Officer.  Our reasons for doing so are set out  briefly  below.
   The result  of  the  appeal  is  absolutely  clear,  whether  reached  by
   considering the claimant's case  in  detail  or  by  allowing  it  to  be
   withdrawn.

8) The issue in dispute in this appeal was not the amount of  the  sponsor's
   earnings but  whether  the  claimant  was  able  to  produce  documentary
   evidence in relation  to  the  sponsor's  earnings  which  satisfied  the
   requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  Prior to 1 March 2013  the  sponsor  was
   employed in an animation studio on a freelance basis by the company which
   now employs him on a salaried  basis.   Because  of  the  change  in  the
   sponsor's employment status, the claimant  applied  for  entry  clearance
   relying on her and the sponsor's savings, which amounted to �26,000.   As
   the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal recorded  at  paragraph  18  of  his
   determination, the claimant did not appreciate  the  total  amount  which
   would be required by way of savings to meet the maintenance  requirement.
   The full amount required was �62,500 held for  a  minimum  of  6  months.
   Because the claimant did not meet this requirement  her  application  was
   refused.

9) With her grounds of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  claimant
   stated that in the 12 months prior to the  application  the  sponsor  had
   earned �45,429 as a freelance consultant but it was acknowledged that the
   relevant documents had not been produced with the application.  There was
   then an Entry Clearance Manager review followed by the hearing before the
   First-tier Tribunal.

10) At this hearing there was a significant amount of  documentary  evidence
   before the Tribunal relating to the sponsor's earnings.   In  particular,
   documents from HMRC were produced which showed that  in  the  year  to  5
   April 2013 the sponsor received income from employment  totalling  �3,333
   (his first month's salary) and had  an  income  from  self-employment  of
   �39,101, making a total of �42, 434, on which tax and national  insurance
   contributions of �9, 744 were due.  Bank statements were  also  produced.
   At paragraph 18 of the determination the judge  recorded,  however,  that
   one requirement of Appendix FM-SE had not been fulfilled.  This  was  the
   requirement to produce the latest unaudited accounts  for  the  sponsor's
   business and an  accountant's  certificate.   The  claimant's  solicitors
   submitted before the First-tier Tribunal that there was a  schedule  from
   the employer showing the sponsor's income from self employment but  there
   was no accountant's certificate.

11) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal concluded that although  there  was
   no accountant's certificate that omission was more than offset by the tax
   documents produced, which showed an income for the relevant tax  year  of
   �42,434.  In the view of the judge it would have been  perverse  to  have
   reached  any  conclusion  other  than  that  the  sponsor  satisfied  the
   maintenance requirements of Appendix FM-SE and for that reason the appeal
   was allowed.

12) The Entry Clearance Officer appealed on the basis  that  Appendix  FM-SE
   comprehensively specified the evidence required.  The Tribunal had  found
   that not all the specified evidence was produced.  The Judge of the First-
   tier Tribunal based his decision on perversity but  the  requirements  of
   the Rules were mandatory and the claimant ought not to have succeeded  in
   her appeal.  Permission to appeal was granted on this basis.

13) At the  hearing  before  us  Mr  Rea  acknowledged  that  there  was  no
   accountant's certificate before the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal.  He
   pointed out, however, that the judge who  granted  permission  to  appeal
   described the  point  raised  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  the
   application  as  "tendentious".   It  was  being  argued  for  the  Entry
   Clearance Officer that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in
   going beyond the mandatory requirements of Appendix FM-SE and should  not
   have relied upon the tax return.  If this was so, the judge  should  have
   considered the appeal under  Article  8.   The  judge  had  made  a  very
   detailed decision and to the extent that there was an error of  law  this
   did not materially affect the outcome of the appeal.  The decision  could
   be re-made and the appeal allowed.   There  was  further  evidence  which
   could be admitted under rule  15(2A).   The  reason  this  had  not  been
   produced before was because the solicitor dealing  with  the  matter  had
   left the firm during the period when a rule 24 notice  should  have  been
   submitted on behalf of the claimant.  An  accountant's  letter  dated  12
   December 2014 was now available.   Mr  Rea  further  submitted  that  the
   requirement for accounts  was  satisfied  by  the  schedule  of  payments
   supplied by the company for which the sponsor had  been  doing  freelance
   work.

14) Having heard from Mr Rea we did not consider it necessary to  hear  from
   Ms Pettersen.

15) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal correctly identified  the  relevant
   requirement at paragraph 7(h)(i)(b) of Appendix FM-SE.  This states  that
   where a business (such as that carried on by the sponsor when working  on
   a freelance basis) is not required to produce  annual  audited  accounts,
   then the latest unaudited accounts and  an  accountant's  certificate  of
   confirmation from an accountant who  is  a  member  of  a  UK  recognised
   supervisory body must be submitted.  It was not disputed before the First-
   tier Tribunal that no such certificate was available at that  time.   The
   hearing  took  place  on  10  March  2014  (although  the   determination
   erroneously gives the date as 10 March 2013.)

16) The question for us was whether the Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   erred in law by allowing the appeal where an accountant's certificate was
   not available.  The judge thought that to dismiss  the  appeal  would  be
   perverse, given that there was, in his view, satisfactory evidence of the
   sponsor's earnings.  The Entry Clearance Officer took  a  different  view
   and has pursued the point on appeal before us.

17) Having regard to the claimant's letter seeking to withdraw her case,  we
   do not consider it necessary to address in detail the submissions made to
   us on  her  behalf  by  Mr  Rea.   The  position  is  that  the  relevant
   requirements of Appendix FM-SE as to the  type  of  documentary  evidence
   required in order to show that the substantive  maintenance  requirements
   were met were not fulfilled in their entirety and accordingly  the  judge
   was wrong to allow the appeal.  Because of the error of law by the  Judge
   of the First-tier Tribunal, we set aside his decision.

18) It is incumbent upon us to re-make the  decision.   There  is  only  one
   decision which the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal could have reached on
   the evidence before him and this was to dismiss the appeal on  the  basis
   that  the  necessary  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  were  not  fully
   satisfied.  Accordingly this is the decision we now make.

19) Before us Mr Rea suggested  that  if  the  documentary  requirements  of
   Appendix FM-SE could not be met, then the judge  should  have  considered
   the appeal under Article 8.  While we acknowledge that the  claimant  and
   her son, who is a British citizen, are living in Serbia  apart  from  the
   sponsor, we do not consider that the judge erred in failing to pursue the
   issue under Article 8.  This is because it was open to  the  claimant  to
   make a further application properly supported by the required  documents.
   This is the course of action which the claimant now intends to follow.


Conclusions

20) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve  the
   making of an error on a point of law.

21) We set aside the decision.

22) We re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.




Anonymity

23) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for  anonymity.   We  have
   not been asked to make such an order and we see no  reason  in  substance
   for such an order to be made.
