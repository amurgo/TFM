Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of Mr Hakan  Kussan,  who  appeals  with  permission
    against a decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  his  appeal
    against  the  respondent's  decision  to  refuse  his  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain as  the  spouse  of  a  British  citizen  of
    Turkish origin, pursuant to paragraph  287  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    HC395 (as amended).

 2. This  decision  falls  to  be  considered  under  the  old  Rules:  the
    respondent refused leave to remain  under  paragraph  287  because  the
    income details provided in the applicant's application  fell  short  of
    the appropriate benefit level by �50.67 a week.  The sponsor's  mother,
    with whom the young couple had been living, provided a  letter  stating
    that she was very happy to support them for as long as necessary:

         "At the moment in the  current  economic  climate  and  the  rental
         market being what it is I feel they may be struggling to make  ends
         meet.  Therefore, I have  on  several  occasions  since  July  2014
         offered and provided financial support in the form of  either  cash
         lump sums, cheques and physically  taken  shopping/groceries  every
         time I visit them, which is usually every two to three weeks.

         I am and always have been a working parent and have a mortgage that
         is due to come to fruition in October 2016.  I have  been  employed
         by the London Borough of Haringey Council in various  posts  within
         human resources  since  1997  and  currently  hold  a  position  of
         employee relations adviser.  My annual income is in the  region  of
         33,000 and I am more than capable and happy to support my  children
         whether it is to set up home or to attend university."

 3. Neither the respondent nor the First-tier Tribunal  took  into  account
    the appellant's savings, which at �5,707.75, divided over the period of
    27 months for which the balance of the leave to remain would have  been
    granted, add �48.78 a week to his income, leaving a shortfall  of  just
    �1.99 a week.  However, in  addition  to  those  savings,  the  various
    current accounts held by the parties disclosed  credit  balances  of  a
    further �453.91.  The credit balances in those accounts appeared to  be
    increasing rather than decreasing.  �453.91 divided over 27  months  is
    more than sufficient to make up the �1.99 per  week  shortfall  on  the
    benefit levels, and in addition, it is clear that the sponsor's  mother
    also would be prepared to spend at least �1.99 a  week  to  assist  her
    daughter and son-in-law.

 4. It is unfortunate that the First-tier Tribunal hearing proceeded on the
    erroneous basis that this couple could not meet the requirements of the
    Rules.  It is plain that on the Rules as they then stood they did  meet
    the Rules and that the appeal  should  have  been  allowed  within  the
    Rules.

 5. I now allow this appeal pursuant to paragraph 287  of  the  Immigration
    Rules as they stood at the date  of  decision.   It  is  not  therefore
    necessary for me to consider the alternative submissions that were made
    under Article 8 outside the Rules but I do so for completeness.

 6. As regards Article 8 outside the Rules the circumstances at the date of
    hearing were that the appellant's wife was pregnant for the third time,
    having previously miscarried two pregnancies, and that  the  child  was
    due to be born just a few weeks after the date of  hearing.   It  would
    certainly have been open to the First-tier Judge to consider that  this
    gave weight to the Article 8 case outside the Rules but  having  regard
    to Section 117B(4) and (5) of the 2002 Act  it  is  unlikely  that  the
    pregnancy alone would have been determinative of this appeal.  However,
    as I have already stated, the Article 8 outside the  Rules  calculation
    is not reached.

 7. Because I find that this appeal succeeds under the Rules the appeal  is
    allowed.  I substitute a decision allowing the appeal.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
