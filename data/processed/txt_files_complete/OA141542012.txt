Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Mukuza (sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Brewer, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Annette Mukuza, was born on 13 November 1987  and  is  a
    female  citizen  of  Uganda.   The  appellant  had  applied  for  entry
    clearance to enter the United Kingdom for settlement as the  spouse  of
    Richard  Mukuza  (hereafter  referred  to  as   the   sponsor).    That
    application was refused by the respondent  on  28  June  2012  and  the
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Fox,  determining
    the appeal on the papers) which, in a determination promulgated  on  15
    May 2013, dismissed  the  appeal.   The  appellant  now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. At the Upper Tribunal hearing at Bradford on  19  September  2013,  the
    sponsor attended in person.   Mrs  Brewer,  a  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer, appeared for the respondent.

 3. Granting permission, Judge Blandy considered it arguable that  (i)  the
    judge had failed to give adequate reasons for his determination of  the
    appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds and; (ii) appeared to have  overlooked
    the exercise of discretion required under paragraph 320 of HC 395.

 4. I was careful to give the sponsor every opportunity to  address  me  on
    the question of the appeal.  I have had regard to the letter which  the
    sponsor wrote following the dismissal of the appeal in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 5. The notice of refusal issued by the Entry Clearance  Officer  indicates
    that the application was refused  under  paragraph  281(i)  and  (iii).
    Further, the application was  dismissed  under  paragraph  320(11)  and
    (22).  Mrs Brewer acknowledged that the judge had failed to indicate in
    his determination that the paragraph 302  grounds  were  discretionary.
    Regarding paragraph 320(11), Judge Fox wrote:

         On the evidence before  me  to  day  and  not  disputed  by  either
         appellant or sponsor, I am satisfied the appellant  had  previously
         contrived in a significant way to frustrate the  intention  of  the
         Immigration Rules  by  overstaying  and  breaching  her  conditions
         attached to her  leave  to  enter,  originally.   She  entered  the
         country in 2008 on a  holiday  visa,  overstayed  and  clearly  ran
         across the UKBA who had raided her sponsor's premises.  She made no
         attempt to introduce herself to the UKBA between 2008 and  February
         2011 and I am therefore satisfied that it was appropriate to refuse
         her application for entry clearance in those circumstances.

 6. It is  certainly  the  case  that  the  judge  did  not  refer  to  the
    discretionary nature of the refusal under paragraph 320 in terms.   The
    grounds of appeal submit that the respondent's entry  clearance  policy
    advised   of   the   need   to   consider   "compelling   compassionate
    circumstances".  I do not consider that the judge has erred in law.  If
    there were compelling compassionate circumstances  in  the  appellant's
    immigration history which she asserts at [3] it is quite unclear to  me
    what they may have been.  The appellant's immigration  history  in  the
    United Kingdom has been poor indeed.  Further, on the facts of the case
    which the appellant and sponsor appear to have agreed before the First-
    tier Tribunal, were paragraph 320(11) a mandatory ground  for  refusal,
    it is difficult to  see  why  the  judge  should  have  considered   it
    necessary to set out the particulars  of  the  appellant's  immigration
    history which I have quoted above.  It is clear to me  that  the  judge
    has indicated at [17] the reasons why it had been "appropriate" for the
    respondent to refuse entry clearance  under  paragraph  320(11).   Best
    practice may have indicated that the  judge  should  have  referred  in
    terms to the discretionary nature of the paragraph but I  am  satisfied
    that he has had in mind the exercise of discretion because  he  clearly
    considered it necessary to justify his decision  by  reference  to  the
    appellant's immigration history . By doing so has avoided any error  in
    approach.

 7. The position is even more straightforward in relation  to  the  refusal
    under  paragraph  320(22).   That  sub-paragraph  provides  that  entry
    clearance should normally be refused where:

         One or more relevant NHS body has notified the Secretary  of  State
         that the person seeking entry or leave to enter has failed to pay a
         charge or charges  with  a  total  value  of  at  least  �1,000  in
         accordance with the relevant NHS Regulations on charges to overseas
         visitors.

 8. The notice of refusal records that just such a  notification  had  been
    made to the Secretary of State indicating that while the appellant  was
    "not legally  in  the  United  Kingdom  [she]  obtained  NHS  treatment
    amounting to �1,843.31 which to  date  is  outstanding."   Neither  the
    appellant nor the sponsor disputed that the sum claimed remained  owing
    at the date of the decision although the sponsor submits that,  by  the
    time of the appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the outstanding  balance  was
    less than �1,000.  Since this is an out of country  appeal,  the  facts
    which the First-tier Tribunal had to consider were  those  appertaining
    as at the date of the decision to refuse; there was no indication  that
    the balance of the fees had fallen below �1,000  at  the  date  of  the
    immigration  decision.  Indeed, the judge noted at  [18]  that  it  had
    been "appropriate to refuse entry clearance under  paragraph  320(22)."
    The judge's use of the word "appropriate" in that paragraph is,  in  my
    opinion, a clear indication that he  was  aware  of  the  discretionary
    nature of the ground; had the ground been mandatory, then I consider it
    likely that the judge would have used words  to  the  effect  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer had no alternative but to refuse in  the  light
    of the sum owing.  Again, I find that the judge has not erred  in  law.
    I find that the judge was aware of  the  discretionary  nature  of  the
    ground of refusal and his decision that the Entry Clearance Officer had
    exercised his discretion correctly  in  refusing  entry  clearance  was
    correct.

 9. As regards paragraph 281, the determination  says  little.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer had refused the application  under  paragraph  281(i)
    because she had not been satisfied the sponsor had been free  to  marry
    the appellant and under paragraph 281(iii) that there was  insufficient
    evidence of an ongoing relationship between the sponsor and  appellant.
    Whilst dealing with the refusal  under  paragraph  320(22),  the  judge
    noted  at  [15]  "while  the  account  [owing  to  the   NHS]   remains
    undischarged [the appellant] cannot meet all the criteria of  paragraph
    281 of the Immigration Rules."   It  is  possible  the  judge  is  here
    referring to paragraph 281(vii)  ("the  applicant  does  not  fall  for
    refusal under the general grounds for refusal.").  Again, best practice
    would suggest that the judge should have dealt  with  paragraph  281(i)
    and (iii) as those had been specific grounds cited by the  ECO  in  the
    refusal.  However, I do not consider that the judge's failure  to  deal
    with paragraph 281 at greater detail disturbs his conclusion.  For  the
    reasons I have given above, the  consideration  of  paragraph  281  was
    nugatory because the application fell to be dismissed  under  paragraph
    320.

10. As regards Article 8, Judge Fox wrote at [19]:

         I have considered the appellant's claim under the Human  Right  Act
         1998, Article 8 (sic).  I find  that  the  UK  government,  in  its
         exercise of a fair  and  firm  immigration  policy  has  not  acted
         disproportionately in refusing a visa for entry.   There  has  been
         family life which could be interfered with but only in an  entirely
         proportionate manner.

11. The brief dismissal of the  Article  8  ECHR  appeal  may  be  open  to
    criticism but one should remember that Judge Fox was here dealing  with
    a paper appeal of an out of country appellant and that the main  thrust
    of her grounds of appeal concerned the refusals under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The parties do not dispute  that  the  Article  8  ECHR  appeal
    should be considered on the basis  of  proportionality.   Although  the
    judge found that there was family life  between  the  sponsor  and  his
    wife, the absence of compelling reasons indicating  that  their  family
    life could only be continued in the United Kingdom  together  with  the
    appellant's own very  poor  immigration  history  amply  justified  the
    dismissal of the appeal on human rights grounds.  The judge could  have
    dealt with the circumstances of the appellant and  sponsor  as  regards
    Article 8 ECHR at greater length but, had he done so, the outcome would
    have been the same.  In the circumstances, I do not intend  to  disturb
    his determination.

DECISION

This appeal is dismissed.
