Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan
For the Respondent:    Not represented - sponsor appeared

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in these  proceedings  is  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    ("ECO").  However, it is convenient to continue to refer to the parties
    as they were before the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT").

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 14 February  1948.   She
    applied for entry clearance as  a  visitor  but  that  application  was
    refused in a decision dated 25 March 2015.  She appealed to the FtT and
    her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hussain ("the  FtJ").
    He allowed the appeal  on  human  rights  grounds,  with  reference  to
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The ECO noted that the appellant had applied to visit the UK for  eight
    weeks, and that she had said that she was retired, and that the cost of
    the  visit  would  be  funded  by  her  son.   With  reference  to  the
    appellant's personal circumstances  the  ECO  said  that  she  had  not
    submitted evidence of her personal circumstances and that without  such
    evidence he was not satisfied that she intended to leave the UK at  the
    end of the visit or that she was genuinely seeking entry as  a  visitor
    for a period not exceeding six months.  It was also concluded that  the
    appellant  had  not  established  that  she  would  be  maintained  and
    accommodated without working or having recourse  to  public  funds,  or
    that she could meet the cost of the  return  or  onward  journey.   The
    decision was upheld by the Entry Clearance Manager ("ECM") who referred
    to the lack of documentary evidence about the appellant's circumstances
    in Nigeria.

 4. So far as Article 8 is concerned, the  ECM  stated  that  although  the
    appellant may have family  life  with  the  sponsor,  the  decision  is
    proportionate.  No satisfactory reason had been put forward as  to  why
    the sponsor in the UK is unable to travel to Nigeria  to  be  with  the
    appellant.  No exceptional circumstances were apparent.

 5. The FtJ heard evidence from the appellant's son,  Mr  Oluseyi  Oduntan.
    The FtJ referred to the fact that the  appeal  could  only  succeed  on
    human rights grounds, and in terms of proportionality said that whether
    the appellant was able to comply  with  the  Immigration  Rules  was  a
    significant factor.

 6. He noted that the ECO acknowledged that the appellant may  have  family
    life with her son.  However, the FtJ concluded that the respondent  had
    given very little information as to how  he  assessed  proportionality.
    He concluded that the acceptance that there is family life between  the
    appellant and her son in the UK is "well justified" given  his  regular
    contact  with  her  through  personal  visits,  as  well  as  telephone
    conversations,  and  also  the  appellant's   reliance   on   financial
    assistance from him.

 7. He concluded at [11] that the reasons for refusing the application were
    "riddled with contradictions".  It was noted that  the  ECO's  decision
    begins by acknowledging that the appellant was retired and  relying  on
    someone else to fund her trip.  The FtJ referred to the information the
    appellant had provided on the application form, including that she  had
    no savings, properties or other income,  and  that  her  son  would  be
    responsible for all her expenses, as well as accommodation.   In  those
    circumstances, he concluded that the ECO's finding that  the  appellant
    had  not  provided   evidence   of   her   circumstances   is   "wholly
    unsustainable".  He also suggested that if more was required then, as a
    matter of fairness, the ECO had a duty to contact the appellant to make
    such other enquiries as he felt necessary.

 8. At [12] the FtJ said that the ECO's "inability to focus" on the reasons
    for refusing the application for entry clearance, suggests  that  there
    has not been a proper assessment of the  appellant's  application.   If
    however, what the ECO had in mind was that the appellant had  not  been
    able to establish that she is financially independent and a  person  of
    substantial means, that should have been stated clearly.   Further,  if
    those were the ECO's reasons, they were clearly wrong because visits to
    the UK are not limited to those who are financially well-off.

 9. At [13] he found that the appellant is a woman of 68  years  who  lives
    with her husband to whom she has been married for 45 years.  She has no
    history of previous travels out of  her  country  and  has  no  adverse
    immigration  history.   She  depends  on  her  children  for  financial
    support.  There was nothing to indicate that that financial support was
    about to stop, he said.  He then posed the rhetorical  question  as  to
    "what basis then could the respondent have concluded that  a  woman  at
    that stage in her life would want to stay in the United Kingdom  beyond
    her permitted leave?"

10. Finally,  he  concluded  that  the  respondent's  decision  as  to  the
    appellant's intentions is not a  sustainable  one.   Having  heard  the
    sponsor give evidence and taking into account the totality of the other
    evidence, he concluded that the appellant "has shown that she satisfies
    the requirements of the immigration rules".  That being the  case,  and
    he having found that there was no  other  factor  pointing  to  a  good
    reason as to why the appellant should be excluded from the UK, he found
    that the decision to exclude her was disproportionate.

11.  The  respondent's  grounds  contend  that  the  FtT's  proportionality
    assessment is inadequate, failing to explain why the refusal  of  entry
    clearance which only allows the parties to be together temporarily,  is
    a disproportionate interference with Article 8 rights.  The FtJ, it  is
    argued, had failed to take  into  account  that  the  sponsor  went  to
    Nigeria in 2015 and his evidence that he could go and visit his  family
    again in Nigeria.  It is contended that the respondent's decision  does
    not interfere with the family life of the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    because the current pattern of visits can continue.

12. Although the FtJ had stated that the respondent had a duty  to  contact
    the appellant to make such other enquiries as was felt  necessary,  the
    onus was on the appellant to satisfy the respondent that  she  met  the
    requirements of the Rules.  It was not for the ECO  to  undertake  such
    additional enquiries.

13. In concluding that the appeal should be allowed on  Article  8  grounds
    because the appellant meets the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,
    the judge had used Article 8 as a "general dispensing power".

14. In submissions Mr Tufan referred me to various  authorities,  including
    AAO v Entry Clearance Officer ECO [2011] EWCA Civ  840  to  the  effect
    that financial dependency is not sufficient to  make  out  a  case  for
    family life.

15. It was submitted that the ECO had not approached the case as  a  family
    life case, and the ECM had simply said that there "may" be family  life
    between the appellant and the sponsor.  There would  need  to  be  more
    than ordinary emotional ties for family life to exist.

16. Reliance was also placed on the decision in Mostafa (Article 8 in entry
    clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) and what was said at [24] about  the
    types of relationships that are likely to  come  within  the  scope  of
    Article 8.

17. The sponsor before me reiterated the basis upon which his mother wanted
    to come to the UK, stating that it is not only him that  she  wants  to
    come and see but her two grandchildren and  her  daughter-in-law.   The
    last time she had seen his first born son was when he was  nine  months
    old.  His son is now 8 years of age.  The appellant had never seen  his
    second child.

18. All the material information had been given in the application.   There
    were no other relevant documents to be provided.  His mother had  never
    travelled out of Nigeria before and has no adverse immigration history.
     He continues to send her money, and did so even after the  application
    for entry clearance was refused.

19. His children are at school in the UK and it is illegal to take them out
    of school for  a  visit.   His  wife  is  studying  and  she  also  has
    difficulties in travelling.  He himself only  has  limited  periods  of
    leave from work.

20. The cost for her to come to the UK would be �870 return, with all other
    expenses being taken care of by him.  For him and his family to  go  to
    Nigeria would cost �6,320, taking into account  flights,  accommodation
    and car rental.  It was therefore more reasonable for her to visit  for
    a few weeks.  She is retired and is able to do so.

    My assessment

21. The FtJ recognised that the appeal could only succeed on  human  rights
    grounds.  In other words, even if the appellant was able  to  establish
    that she met the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,  she  was  not
    entitled to succeed in her appeal unless there was  a  disproportionate
    breach of her Article 8 rights.

22. Mr Tufan  contended  that,  contrary  to  the  FtJ's  conclusions,  the
    relationship between the appellant and her son (and/or other family  in
    the UK) did not constitute family life.  However, the problem with that
    contention is that it is not a matter raised in the grounds challenging
    the decision  of  the  FtJ.   The  grounds  complain  about  the  FtJ's
    proportionality assessment but nowhere is there any contention that the
    FtJ's conclusion as to family life is erroneous in law.  Indeed, in the
    grounds it is said that the parties are free to continue to enjoy their
    family life "as they have previously construed it".

23. Furthermore, the ECM's review states, or at least implies, that  it  is
    accepted that there is  family  life  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor, stating that "although the appellant may have  a  family  life
    with the sponsor", etc.  Mr Tufan was correct  to  refer  to  the  word
    "may", but that can be read in different ways.   Certainly,  the  ECM's
    review does not suggest that there is no family life between them.

24. It is not suggested on behalf of the respondent  that  any  submissions
    were made on behalf of the respondent at the hearing before the FtJ  to
    the effect that there was no family life between the appellant and  the
    sponsor or other family in the UK.  It may reasonably be supposed  that
    this is why the FtJ said at [9] that "the respondent's acceptance  that
    there is family life between the appellant and her son in this  country
    is well justified".

25. It is true that in Kugathas v Secretary of State [2003] EWCA Civ 31  it
    was decided that ties between a parent and  adult  children  would  not
    generally constitute family life unless there is  something  more  than
    normal emotional ties.  It may even be that another judge may have come
    to a different view about family life in this case, or that it could be
    said that finding in terms of family in this case was a rather generous
    finding.

26. However, the grounds upon which  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted did not  include  any  argument  about  the  FtJ's
    finding in terms of family life.  That fact, and at least an  ambiguous
    stance taken by the ECM in the review, as  well  as  the  lack  of  any
    indication that family life was a  challenged  issue  before  the  FtJ,
    means that I consider  that  it  is  not  open  to  the  respondent  to
    challenge that issue at this late stage.

27. The challenge as set out in the grounds relates to proportionality.   I
    have considered the decision in Kaur (visit appeals; Article 8)  [2015]
    UKUT 00487 (IAC) in which the interrelationship between  the  Rules  in
    visit visa cases and Article 8  was  considered.   That  decision  also
    dealt with what could be said to be inconsistency between the  decision
    in Mostafa and Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261  (IAC),
    the conclusion being that there was in fact  no  inconsistency  between
    them.  At [23] the Upper Tribunal in Kaur said as follows:

         "Having analysed these two competing  sets  of  considerations,  we
         find the latter are to be preferred.  The visitor rules may not  be
         a perfect reflection of the  Secretary  of  State's  view  of  what
         Article 8 requires, but, utilising the analysis of Richards  LJ  in
         SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387, we do not discern  any  significant
         gap between the  visitor  rules  and  "what  Article  8  requires".
         Indeed, on the analysis in SS  (Congo)  there  is  less  basis  for
         considering in the visitor context that  Article  8  requires  more
         than the LTR rules provide because (a) what is in issue in relation
         to an application for leave to enter is more in the  nature  of  an
         appeal to the state's positive  obligations  under  Article  8  (SS
         (Congo) at [39(ii)]; see also Shamin Box [2002] UKIAT 02212);  (and
         b) as a result the requirements upon the state under Article 8  are
         less stringent in the LTE context than in the LTR context;  see  SS
         (Congo) at [38].  Within the context of the LTE rules, there is the
         additional fact that the visitor rules are not in any  event  about
         reuniting families, only about allowing visitors a short  visit  in
         the UK, which can be for the purposes of  visiting  family  members
         but on the strict understanding that applicants know  that  outside
         the context of that visit, the  family  concerned  will  reside  in
         different countries."

28. The appeal with which I am concerned, unlike that in Kaur, is  not  one
    in  which  the  appellant  failed  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  In this case the FtJ concluded that  the  appellant
    had established that she met the requirements of the Rules in terms  of
    paragraph 41, in all respects.  Thus, although  he  did  not  expressly
    state as much, with reference to each of the requirements of the  Rules
    that was in issue, it is plain from his decision that he found that the
    appellant did intend a visit for a limited  period  and  that  she  did
    intend to leave the UK at the end of the period of the visit.  He  also
    found that she met the maintenance and  accommodation  requirements  of
    the Rules and that she could fund the cost of the return trip.

29. It is important to bear in mind that again, so far as the  grounds  are
    concerned, there is no complaint about the FtJ's  conclusion  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the Rules.  No  submissions  in  that
    respect were made before me either.

30. The FtJ recognised the public interest in play in terms of excluding an
    individual who, for example, did not intend to leave the UK at the  end
    of the period of the visit, or who could not meet the  maintenance  and
    accommodation requirements of the Rules.  Thus, at [15]  he  said  that
    there was no other factor pointing to a  good  reason  as  to  why  the
    appellant should be excluded from the UK.  Again, it is  not  contended
    on behalf of the respondent that the FtJ failed to recognise the public
    interest at play.

31. However, I do consider that there is merit in the argument advanced  in
    the grounds in terms of the FtJ's apparent failure to take into account
    that the sponsor at  least  could  continue  to  visit  his  mother  in
    Nigeria, as he has done in the past.   The  grounds  contend  that  the
    status quo could continue.  The question arises as to what interference
    there would be with the family life that the appellant and the  sponsor
    are said to have, given that visits could continue.  This is  a  not  a
    matter that is addressed by the FtJ.

32. Whilst I also consider that the FtJ was  wrong  to  conclude  that  the
    respondent had a duty to contact  the  appellant  to  make  such  other
    enquiries as was thought necessary, any error of law in that respect is
    not material.  The sponsor said in his submissions before me that there
    were in fact no other documents that could be provided.  In any  event,
    the FtJ's  view  in  that  respect  does  not  seem  to  have  featured
    particularly strongly in the proportionality assessment.

33.  However,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  FtJ  erred  in   law   in   the
    proportionality assessment in terms of a lack of consideration  of  the
    extent to which the existing family life, as it has been found, between
    the sponsor and the appellant, could continue.  In the circumstances, I
    consider that this is a material matter which requires the decision  to
    be set aside, to be re-made in the Upper Tribunal. In addition, and for
    the same reasons, an error of law is evident in relation to the earlier
    stage of an Article 8 assessment and the need to consider whether there
    is in fact any interference or lack of respect for family life.

34. In re-making the decision, the findings of fact made by the FtJ are  to
    stand, they not having been the subject of any complaint on  behalf  of
    the respondent and not otherwise infected by the error of law.  I  also
    take into account the further information given to me by the  appellant
    in terms of the practical difficulties involved in his taking his whole
    family to Nigeria to visit the appellant, with reference to cost.  This
    is evidence of the circumstances obtaining at the time of the decision.
     It is not new information arising post-decision, namely  the  cost  of
    taking the whole family to Nigeria.  That cost in relative terms  would
    have prevailed at the date of the decision in any event,  even  if  the
    precise cost may have differed.

35. The sponsor explained that the purpose of the  visit  was  not  just  a
    visit to him, but to see his children and her daughter-in-law.   Whilst
    there is no finding of  family  life  between  the  appellant  and  her
    grandchildren and daughter-in-law, it is reasonable  to  conclude  that
    the family life between the sponsor and the appellant  is  affected  by
    the appellant's relationship with, in particular, her grandchildren.  I
    do not consider that the issue of family life should considered  to  be
    so compartmentalised that  it  fails  to  recognise  the  wider  family
    considerations such as are evident here.

36. In the circumstances, I consider that there is interference, or lack of
    respect for, the family life between the appellant and the sponsor when
    the wider family  life  implications  to  which  I  have  referred  are
    considered. Their family life is  compromised  in  circumstances  where
    their relationship is restricted by the inability of the  appellant  to
    be able fully to engage with and develop her relationship with  him  in
    terms of his intimate family relationships.

37. It is the sponsor's understandable wish  for  his  mother  to  see  her
    grandchildren.  Thus, the visits by the sponsor to the appellant  could
    continue but the wider family life considerations are not  catered  for
    in  that  scenario.   The  question  to  be  asked  is,  is   there   a
    disproportionate interference with family life in  circumstances  where
    the appellant meets all the requirements of the Immigration Rules,  and
    where there is considerable expense in the sponsor taking his family to
    visit the appellant in Nigeria.

38. Furthermore, and significantly, the public interest in the  maintenance
    of an effective immigration control is not compromised in circumstances
    where  an  appellant,  as  here,  has  been  found  to  meet  all   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

39. Having considered all the circumstances, I am satisfied that  there  is
    interference or lack of  respect  for  family  life.  The  sponsor  has
    explained that it is, in effect, prohibitively  expensive  for  him  to
    bring all his family to Nigeria to visit the  appellant.  In  addition,
    although the family life that exists, and that has been found to exist,
    is between him and the appellant, and  not  her  grandchildren  or  his
    wife, the wider implications of their family life need to be taken into
    account. It is not an answer to say  simply,  that  the  sponsor  could
    continue to visit and the status quo could continue.

40. I am satisfied therefore, that the respondent's decision  represents  a
    disproportionate interference with, or  lack  of  respect  for,  family
    life. Accordingly, the appeal on human rights grounds with reference to
    Article 8 of the ECHR is allowed.







    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision is set aside,  and  the  decision  re-
    made, allowing the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.
