Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Gray & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1) This an appeal against a decision by a panel of the  First-tier  Tribunal
   comprising Judge of the First-tier Tribunal J C Grant-Hutchison and Judge
   of the First-tier Tribunal A M S Green.  The panel  dismissed  an  appeal
   against a refusal of entry clearance by the respondent.

2) The appellant was born on 2 January 1981 and is a national  of  Pakistan.
   He applied for entry clearance to join his wife, Mrs Shabana Kauser,  who
   is the sponsor in this appeal.  The decision under  appeal  is  dated  31
   October 2013, although the refusal decision was subsequently  revised  by
   the respondent.   The issues before the First-tier Tribunal were,  first,
   whether the appellant  satisfied  the  maintenance  requirements  of  the
   Immigration Rules and,  second,  whether  the  relationship  between  the
   appellant and the sponsor was  genuine  and  subsisting  and  the  couple
   intended to live together in the UK.  At the hearing  before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal  the  respondent  conceded  on  the  basis  of  documentary
   evidence from HMRC that the income threshold under the Immigration  Rules
   was met.  It was not accepted, however, that the appellant satisfied  the
   related evidential requirements set out  in  Appendix  FM-SE.   This  was
   because there were minor discrepancies between the wage slips provided on
   behalf of the sponsor and  the  corresponding  entries  credited  in  her
   building society pass book.  The discrepancies amounted to 12p per  month
   or ï¿½1.44 per year.

3) The sponsor gave evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.  She  explained
   that she spoke to her husband several times a week.  The majority of  the
   calls were conducted via Skype or Viper.  These were internet  calls  and
   were much cheaper than mobile or landline calls.   She  did  occasionally
   call the appellant using her mobile phone.  She had been using her mobile
   to demonstrate for evidential  purposes  how  often  she  telephoned  her
   husband.  She also used telephone cards.

4) The First-tier panel accepted that the  sponsor  telephoned  her  husband
   using a combination of Skype, Viper and her mobile phone.  The panel were
   unable to make a finding, however, as to how often and for how  long  the
   sponsor spoke to the appellant using these methods of communication.  The
   panel  considered  that  it  would  have  been  possible  and  reasonably
   practicable for the sponsor to have produced call log  records  generated
   by Skype and Viper to substantiate her evidence  that  the  bulk  of  her
   communication with the appellant was conducted by these means but she did
   not do this.

5) The panel noted that the appellant applied for  entry  clearance  in  May
   2013, some three years and two months after her marriage to the  sponsor.
   There was little evidence to  support  the  existence  of  a  matrimonial
   relationship at the time when the refusal decision was made.   The  panel
   expected that to demonstrate a subsisting matrimonial relationship  there
   would  be  evidence  of  regular  contact  and  signs  of  companionship,
   emotional support, affection and an  abiding  interest  in  each  other's
   welfare and well-being.  There was evidence from the sponsor that she had
   travelled to  Pakistan  to  spend  time  with  the  appellant  since  the
   marriage.  She had been to Pakistan from 15 February to  29  March  2013.
   She stated that she had  stayed  with  the  appellant  when  she  was  in
   Pakistan.  The panel accepted that the sponsor had  visited  Pakistan  at
   this time but there was no  supporting  evidence  showing  that  she  had
   stayed with the appellant for some or all of the time.  The  panel  noted
   that there  were  no  statements  or  letters  from  family,  friends  or
   neighbours in relation to this visit or the time the  appellant  and  the
   sponsor claimed to have spent together.  The appellant did not  establish
   any more than the bare fact of the visit.  He last saw the sponsor on  29
   March 2013.  There was only limited evidence to establish the nature  and
   quality of contact between them.  The appellant  produced  the  sponsor's
   mobile telephone bills and his call records covering a  period  from  May
   2013.  There was  no  other  evidence  to  support  the  existence  of  a
   matrimonial relationship between the date of the marriage and the date of
   the application.  Accordingly, the  panel  was  not  satisfied  that  the
   relationship between the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  was  genuine  and
   subsisting and that they intended to live together in the UK.

6) The panel referred also to the discrepancy in respect of the evidence  of
   financial requirements under Appendix FM-SE.  The panel pointed out  that
   the appellant could not meet these requirements  as  the  sponsor's  wage
   slips did not correspond exactly to the credits  shown  on  her  building
   society statements.   The  discrepancy  was  very  small  and  the  panel
   accepted the sponsor's evidence that she did not know about this until it
   was brought to her attention shortly before the hearing.  However,  there
   was no provision whereby this  discrepancy  might  be  disregarded  under
   Appendix FM-SE and accordingly the appeal failed on this ground also.

Application for permission to appeal

7) In the application for permission to appeal it was pointed out on  behalf
   of the appellant that the panel accepted that the marriage was valid.  It
   was an arranged marriage.  The panel accepted the sponsor's evidence that
   she telephoned her husband using either Skype, Viper or her mobile phone.
    It was contended that the panel erred by finding there was  insufficient
   evidence of regular contact.  The productions for the appellant  included
   mobile telephone bills for the sponsor for the period from November  2013
   to June 2014 and telephone invoices for September and October  2014.   It
   was contended that the panel erred in finding that this evidence was  not
   in existence at the time when the decision was made  and  the  respondent
   could not therefore have been aware of the type  and  regularity  of  the
   contact between the sponsor and the appellant.

8) The application continues that at paragraph 18 of  the  decision  it  was
   recorded that the appellant had  provided  telephone  records  showing  a
   total of 28 highlighted calls to the UK number  given  for  the  sponsor,
   together with telephone cards.  The  panel  erred  by  finding  that  the
   telephone bills and evidence of contact through Skype  and  Viper  should
   not have been taken into account in terms of the test in DR  (ECO:  post-
   decision evidence) Morocco [2005] UKIAT 00038.   There  was  in  addition
   evidence of the sponsor having visited the appellant in Pakistan.

9) In relation to the financial requirements  the  application  pointed  out
   that the respondent had  conceded  that  the  appellant  met  the  income
   threshold on the basis of documents from HMRC.  There was  a  very  small
   discrepancy between the sponsor's wage slips and the  credit  entries  in
   her building society passbook, amounting to 12p per  month.   Given  that
   the discrepancy was so minor the panel should  have  allowed  the  appeal
   under Appendix FM-SE.  This would have been on  the  basis  that  missing
   information was verifiable in  terms  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  sub-paragraph
   D(d)(iii), from other documents  submitted  with  the  application.   The
   minor discrepancy was verifiable from the HMRC correspondence  and  other
   financial evidence lodged.

10) Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that in  relation  to  the
   subsistence of the marriage it was arguable that the Tribunal had applied
   too high a standard of proof.  In view of the evidence available  in  the
   context of an arranged marriage it was arguable that the panel had  erred
   in concluding that a matrimonial relationship did not exist.

11) In relation to the second ground, it was  arguable  that  the  once  the
   respondent had conceded that  the  income  threshold  had  been  met,  as
   verified by HMRC, then the appellant had met the  requirements  to  which
   the documents related.

12) A rule 24 notice dated 11  March  2015  was  lodged  on  behalf  of  the
   respondent.  This stated that at paragraph 22 of their decision the panel
   had given sound reasons for finding the marriage was not  subsisting,  in
   accordance with the relevant case law.  In addition, the requirements  in
   Appendix FM-SE were not met.

Submissions

13) In his submission on behalf of the appellant, Mr Winter referred  us  to
   the decision in Goudey (subsisting marriage - evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT
   00041 and submitted that the panel in the present  appeal  had  made  the
   same error as the First-tier  Tribunal  in  Goudey  by  failing  to  take
   account of evidence in the form of telephone cards to show  communication
   between the couple.  There was evidence of telephone contact between June
   2012 and January 2013, which pre-dated the refusal decision, and this was
   to be found at Appendix R of the Home Office bundle.   Phone  cards  were
   used by the sponsor, as recorded by the panel  at  paragraph  20  of  the
   decision.  The panel accepted that  there  was  telephone  contact.   The
   panel should have been aware of the cultural context  in  terms  of  this
   being an arranged marriage.

14) It was pointed out that  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  it  was  not
   suggested that any apparent lack of contact between the appellant and the
   sponsor was explained by the marriage having been an arranged  one.   The
   parties instead relied  upon  contact  by  telephone  to  show  that  the
   marriage was subsisting and that they intended to live together.

15) In response, Mr Winter  pointed  out  that  in  granting  permission  to
   appeal the judge in question had stated that it was  arguable  the  panel
   had applied too high a standard of proof.  This was consistent  with  the
   error in Goudey.  This was a legally recognised marriage  in  which  both
   parties wanted to be together.  It was improbable that the calls recorded
   would have been  to  anyone  else.   The  evidence  of  the  sponsor  was
   connected to the evidence of the appellant.

16) Reference was  made  to  call  records  relating  to  the  appellant  at
   Appendix R of the respondent's bundle.  The question  was  raised  as  to
   whether any of the calls recorded were to the telephone  numbers  of  the
   sponsor.  Mr Winter acknowledged that this had not been established.  Mrs
   O'Brien pointed out that the refusal decision referred to 28  highlighted
   calls.  There did not, however, appear to be any highlighted calls in the
   documentary evidence in the respondent's  bundle.   Mr  Winter  submitted
   that there were highlighted calls in the second and third inventories for
   the appellant.  However, the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not  been  given
   evidence relating to the sponsor's landline number.

17) Turning to the financial requirements, Mr Winter  submitted  that  there
   had been a concession on behalf of the respondent on the  basis  of  HMRC
   documents showing that the earnings of the sponsor exceeded  the  minimum
   income threshold.  There was  a  12p  discrepancy  between  each  of  the
   sponsor's wage slips and the credits to her building society account.  No
   explanation for this discrepancy had been provided.  Mr Winter sought  to
   rely on Appendix D(d)(iii) of Appendix FM-SE, which was quoted on page  5
   of the decision at paragraph 14.  The  discrepancy  constituted  "missing
   information" but this was verifiable from other documents submitted  with
   the application.

18) Having heard from Mr Winter, we did not consider it  necessary  to  hear
   from Mrs O'Brien on behalf of the respondent.

Discussion

19) The position in this appeal is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  not
   satisfied on the evidence before it that, at the  date  of  the  decision
   appealed, against the  appellant  and  sponsor  were  in  a  genuine  and
   subsisting relationship and intended to live together  in  the  UK.   The
   panel  accepted  that  the  sponsor  telephoned  the  appellant  using  a
   combination of Skype, Viper and her mobile telephone but were  unable  to
   make a finding as to how frequently and for how long  the  appellant  and
   the sponsor used these methods to  communicate  with  one  another.   The
   panel derived little assistance from such evidence of  telephone  contact
   as was before the respondent at the date  of  decision.   This  comprised
   telephone cards, which did not show any  numbers  called,  and  telephone
   records for the appellant.  The telephone records for the appellant  were
   for a limited period and did not  identify  in  a  readily  ascertainable
   manner whether the appellant had been calling the sponsor.

20) There was evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  showing  that  the
   sponsor visited Pakistan in February  and  March  2013.   The  First-tier
   Tribunal expected more evidence, however, in relation to this  visit,  in
   addition to the sponsor's own  testimony,  than  simply  her  reservation
   details and boarding pass.  The  panel  considered  it  significant  that
   evidence was not provided from family, friends or neighbours in  relation
   this visit and any time the appellant and the sponsor  might  have  spent
   together.  The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal did  not,  in  the
   view of the panel,  show  the  existence  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting
   relationship and an intention by the parties to live together in the UK.

21) To counter this finding  it  was  argued,  first,  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal applied too high a standard of proof;  second,  that  they  fell
   into the error identified in Goudey; and third that they disregarded post-
   decision evidence.  This third point was not pursued  strenuously  by  Mr
   Winter at the hearing before us.  Even if the evidence was admissible  in
   terms of section 85A, as relating to the  circumstances  appertaining  at
   the time of the decision, which the First-tier Tribunal questioned,  this
   evidence, such as it was, was produced only after the appellant  and  the
   sponsor were notified that the appellant's application had  been  refused
   by the respondent.

22) On the second point, there is nothing of substance in  the  decision  of
   the First-tier Tribunal to satisfy us that too high a standard  of  proof
   was applied.  The First-tier Tribunal referred, at paragraph  19  of  the
   decision, to the case of Naz (subsisting marriage -  standard  of  proof)
   Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00040.  In that  case  the  standard  of  proof  was
   clearly set out as the balance of probabilities and although the Tribunal
   did not refer to the case in relation  to  this  specific  point,  it  is
   apparent that the case was before  them.   In  considering  whether  this
   standard of proof was met, the First-tier Tribunal was entitled  to  have
   regard to any deficiencies or omissions in the evidence before  them,  as
   identified in the decision.

23) So far as the decision in Goudey is concerned, it was accepted  in  that
   case that evidence of telephone cards was capable of being  corroborative
   of a contention by the parties that they communicated by telephone,  even
   though such data did not confirm the particular number  the  sponsor  was
   calling in the country in question.  It was not a  requirement  that  the
   parties also wrote or  texted  each  other.   This  proposition  was  put
   forward, however, on the basis that there were no countervailing  factors
   generating suspicion as to the intentions of the parties.  It was only on
   this  basis  that  evidence  of  telephone  cards  might  be   considered
   sufficient to discharge the burden of proof.   In the present appeal  the
   First-tier Tribunal considered there were grounds for questioning whether
   the evidence of  contact  between  the  sponsor  and  the  appellant  was
   consistent with the existence of a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.
   Evidence of  telephone  cards  would  not  by  themselves  satisfy  other
   deficiencies  in  the  evidence  in  respect  of  the   nature   of   the
   relationship.

24) The conclusion we come to is that the First-tier Tribunal  was  entitled
   for the reasons which were given to find that the appellant had not shown
   that  there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  between  the
   appellant and the sponsor and that they intended to live together in  the
   UK.  It was for the First-tier Tribunal to make findings on  this  matter
   according to the evidence before it and its  findings  can  be  disturbed
   only if it made an error of law.  On the basis of the submissions we have
   heard, we are not satisfied that an error of law was made and accordingly
   the findings by the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

25) We would point  out,  however,  that  there  is  no  suggestion  in  the
   findings made that the appellant has attempted to deceive the  respondent
   or the immigration authorities in the  UK.   It  may  be  that  there  is
   evidence in existence to  show  that  the  relationship  requirements  of
   Appendix FM are met, even though this evidence was not before the  First-
   tier  Tribunal.   This  would  still  leave,  however,  the   unexplained
   discrepancy over the sponsor's wage slips.  On this particular  issue  we
   do not consider  it  necessary  to  give  further  consideration  to  the
   findings made by the First-tier Tribunal,  which  on  the  basis  of  the
   evidence and explanations offered before it, should stand.
Conclusions

26) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

27) We do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

28) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for  anonymity.   We  have
   not been asked to make such an order and we see no  reason  of  substance
   for doing so.
