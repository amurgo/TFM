Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    -


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The Respondent Mr Shoaib is a national of Pakistan and his date  of
         birth is 12th September 1986.

    Background

      2. It is common ground that Mr Shoaib has lived in the United  Kingdom
         with valid leave since the 25th July 2012. He was  given  leave  to
         enter under paragraph 281 of the old rules. So it was that when  he
         made an application to vary that leave so as to extend  it  on  the
         8th September 2014 it was considered under paragraph 284.    It  is
         also  agreed  that  Mr  Shoaib  is  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with his British wife and that they are  supported  by
         Mr Shoaib's work in a factory, which earns  him  above  the  amount
         required under the Rules for  maintenance  and  accommodation.  The
         only issue raised by the Secretary of State's refusal notice of 5th
         November 2014 was Mr Shoaib's failure to meet the  requirements  of
         paragraph  284(ix)(a)  by  submitting  an  English  language   test
         certificate  from  an  approved  provider.    The  certificate   he
         submitted showed him to have higher  than  the  required  level  in
         English proficiency, but it was not issued by a provider listed  in
         Appendix O of the Rules. The certificate  was  issued  by  "Pearson
         Edexcel".  Mr Shoaib might be  forgiven  for  having  thought  that
         "Pearson Edexcel" was an approved provider, since Pearson do appear
         on the approved list and the certificate he  was  given  bears  the
         Pearson logo. That was  not  however  sufficient  to  persuade  the
         Secretary  of  State  that  leave  should  be  granted,   and   his
         application was turned down.

      3. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Caswell)
         argument  was  made  to  the  effect  that  Pearson  Edexcel  is  a
         subsidiary company of Pearson and as such the decision  was  wrong.
         The First-tier Tribunal was not satisfied that this was  the  case.
         There is no challenge to that decision.

      4. In the alternative it was argued on Mr  Shoaib's  behalf  that  the
         Secretary of State should have had regard to  her  own  policy,  as
         expressed in the Immigration Directorates' Instruction 'Chapter 8 -
         Family Members'.   It was  submitted  that  this  published  policy
         permitted a discretionary departure from the  Rules.  Reliance  was
         placed on paragraph 3.7 Granting Leave to Remain which reads:

             "If there is no reason to doubt the marriage is genuine  then,
             provided the key points are satisfied, leave to remain  should
             be granted for 2 years on Code 1"

         It was submitted that "key points" should be read to mean the  "key
         points" identified at paragraph 3.1 of  the  same  document;  those
         boiling down to it being a genuine marriage.   Further reliance was
         placed on an unreported error  of  law  decision  by  Deputy  Upper
         Tribunal  Judge  Lever  in  which  this  argument  was   apparently
         accepted.

      5. Judge Caswell agreed with the argument advanced for Mr  Shoaib  and
         on  the  6th  February  2015  the  appeal  was  allowed  under  the
         Immigration  Rules.  The  appeal  on  human  rights   grounds   was
         dismissed.





    Error of Law

      6. On the 15th July 2015 I found there to  an  error  of  law  in  the
         determination of the First-tier Tribunal, which was set  aside.  My
         reasons were as follows:

          i) The argument advanced about the IDI, and accepted by the First-
             tier  Tribunal  in  this  case,  is  misconceived.  The  lines
             extracted from  paragraph  3.7  are  not  to  be  read  as  an
             indication that decision-makers  can  ignore  the  substantive
             requirements of the Rules. That  much  is  apparent  from  the
             document as a whole, for instance section 3.6, which refers to
             the English Language requirement, and the preface at section 3
             which reads:

                  "the requirements to be met by a person seeking to  remain
                  in the United Kingdom as a spouse of a person settled here
                  are set out in paragraph 284 of HC 395 as amended and MUST
                  be referred to when reading the following advice"

         ii) The Respondent's representatives interpreted this to  indicate
             that the requirements of paragraph 284 must  be  referred  to,
             but not necessarily met. I do not agree. The clue  is  in  the
             phrase "requirements to be met".  It cannot be the  case  that
             this policy document intends to dispense with the  substantive
             requirements of the rules in any case where there is a genuine
             marriage.

        iii) For this reason it was not open to Judge Caswell to allow  the
             appeal under the Rules. Nor was it open to  her,  if  she  had
             been so minded, to allow this appeal as not in accordance with
             the law on the basis that the policy  had  not  been  applied.
             There is nothing in the IDI which justifies a  departure  from
             the Rule.  All that the phrase at 3.7 is intended to convey is
             that the decision maker should be satisfied that the  marriage
             is genuine and that the key points are met.

      7. The determination was therefore set aside. In turning  to  the  re-
         making I made the following observations:

             "This is an  unfortunate  situation  for  Mr  Shoaib  to  find
             himself in. He came to the United Kingdom in  compliance  with
             the Rules, has found a job, paid tax, lived with his wife  and
             learned English.  Having looked at his English  language  test
             certificate I can see why he might have  thought  it  to  come
             from an approved provider. The consequence of his  failure  to
             check is  as  follows.  The  Home  Office  have  retained  his
             passport with the result that he has been  unable  to  take  a
             test with an approved provider. If his appeal is dismissed  by
             this Tribunal he will have 28 days before his leave runs  out,
             and unless he decides to overstay he will have  to  return  to
             Pakistan in order to start the process  of  settlement  again.
             That will involve an application made under  Appendix  FM.  At
             present he and his wife are supported by his  income.  In  any
             application for entry clearance he can no longer rely on those
             earnings. His wife will have to obtain a  job,  and  one  that
             pays at least ï¿½18,600.  The couple's separation  is  therefore
             likely to be a long one. As it was put in the determination of
             Judge  Caswell,  it  will  be  "expensive  and  inconvenient",
             "painful and  distressing";  all  because  he  did  not  check
             whether "Pearson Edexcel" was the same company as "Pearson".

         It seems to me that in the very particular  circumstances  of  this
         case it would be appropriate to adjourn the re-making of the appeal
         and give Mr Shoaib an opportunity to take a test with  an  approved
         provider. The parties agreed. I am told that he has  to  date  been
         unable to do this because the  Home  Office  has  his  passport.  I
         therefore direct that his passport be returned to him, or if  there
         is a good public policy reason why that cannot be  done,  the  Home
         Office issue a letter or other  document  which  will  satisfy  any
         approved English Language test provider that Mr Shoaib is  entitled
         to take this test. This  must  be  done  within  28  days  of  this
         decision being received.  Whether Mr Shoaib does so, or passes  it,
         is a matter for him".

      8. The matter was therefore adjourned.

    The Re-Made Decision

      9. At the hearing before me of today's date Mr  Harrison  informed  me
         that Mr Shoaib has now been given leave to remain. The Secretary of
         State therefore wishes to withdraw  her  case.  I  consent  to  the
         Secretary of State withdrawing her case, and in the remaking, allow
         the appeal of Mr Shoaib with reference to the Immigration Rules.

    Decisions

     10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

     11. The decision in the appeal is re-made as follows:  "the  appeal  is
         allowed under the Immigration Rules".

     12. I make no direction as to anonymity.
