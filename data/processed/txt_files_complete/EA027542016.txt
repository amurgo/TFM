Chambers Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, who is a national of Pakistan, appeals from the decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge   Bennett   sitting   at   Hendon
    Magistrates' Court on 30 June 2017) dismissing his appeal  against  the
    decision to refuse to issue him with a permanent residence card as  the
    former spouse of an EEA national who had exercised Treaty rights in the
    United Kingdom.  The First-tier Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that the appellant requires  anonymity
    for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On 11  January  2018,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foudy  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following  reasons:   "(ii)  the
    grounds argue that the Judge erred in his calculation of the period  of
    time which the appellant was married to his former spouse.   (iii)   In
    the decision the Judge calculated that the marriage came to an end when
    the parties separated rather than at decree absolute.  It  is  arguable
    that this was an error under EU Law."

Relevant Background

 3. The appellant married 'Mrs B', a national of Portugal,  in  the  London
    Borough of Ealing  on  27  November  2009.   On  28  October  2010  the
    appellant was issued with a residence card as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA
    national exercising Treaty rights in the United Kingdom.  This card was
    valid until 28 October  2015.   On  15  September  2015  the  appellant
    applied for a permanent residence card.

 4. On 18 February 2016  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing the application.  She was not satisfied that, at the  date  of
    divorce on 8 January 2016, Mrs B had been a qualified person,  or  that
    the appellant had been residing in the UK for five years in  accordance
    with the 2006 Regulations.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. At  the  hearing  before  Judge  Bennett,  both  parties  were  legally
    represented.

 6. The appellant's evidence on appeal was that he  and  Mrs  B  had  lived
    together from the date of their marriage until 18 February  2015,  when
    Mrs B left him.  He had had no contact with  her  until  late  February
    2017, when she telephoned him because she heard that he  was  suffering
    from kidney stones.  In the course of that telephone call, he asked her
    to send him documentary evidence showing her income and  the  work  she
    had done in the period  up  to  8  January  2016.  It  was  after  that
    telephone conversation that Mrs B had sent him some tax calculations.

 7. The appellant produced  documents  relating  to  Navtrader  UK  Ltd,  a
    company which he said carried on the business of online selling, and in
    respect of which he was the "Sole Trader".  The appellant said that, as
    well as working as a self-employed cleaner, Mrs B had also  worked  for
    Navtrader UK Ltd as  a  self-employed  person  and  she  had  been  the
    Secretary of the Company at all times from its incorporation on 9 April
    2014 until 18 February 2015.  She had not received any remuneration  or
    wages from the Company. Instead, she had received a dividend  from  the
    Company.

 8. The Judge gave his reasons for  dismissing  the  appeal  in  a  31-page
    decision which was promulgated on 17 July 2017.

 9. At paragraphs [24] and [25] (pages 18 and 19) the Judge  gave  detailed
    reasons for not being satisfied that  during  the  tax  years  2010/11,
    2011/12 or 2012/13 Mrs B was carrying on business  on  a  self-employed
    basis, either as a self-employed cleaner or in any other capacity.

10. At paragraph [26] (pages 20 and 21), the Judge  gave  detailed  reasons
    for not being satisfied that Mrs B  was  exercising  Treaty  rights  in
    subsequent years, including in the period leading up  to  the  date  of
    divorce on 8 January 2016.

11. At paragraphs  [27]-[30]  (pages  22-26),  the  Judge  gave  even  more
    detailed reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence that he and Mrs
    B had separated on 18 February 2015, and for finding that in truth they
    had separated  on  or  about  17  July  2014;  and  for  rejecting  the
    appellant's evidence that Mrs B had exercised Treaty rights as a worker
    or a self-employed person for or on behalf of Navtrader UK, despite  it
    being officially recorded that Mrs B was appointed as  a  Secretary  of
    the Company on 9 April 2014 and that she resigned from this  office  on
    12 March 2015.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

12. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Mustapha (who did not appear below) developed the case advanced
    in the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  In reply, Ms Isherwood
    submitted that the findings which the Judge had  made  were  reasonably
    open to him on the evidence, and no material error of law was made out.

Discussion

Ground 1

13. Ground 1 is that the Judge was wrong to treat the appellant  as  having
    ceased to be a family member  of  an  EEA  national  at  the  point  of
    separation, rather than at the point of divorce.

14. At paragraph [34] (page  28)  the  Judge  summarised  his  conclusions.
    These were: (i) that there was not any continuous period of five  years
    before (or ending on) 8 January 2016  throughout  which  Mrs  B  was  a
    qualified person; and (ii) that the appellant and Mrs B had  not  lived
    together for more than about four  years  and  eight  months  following
    their marriage on 27 November 2009.

15. He was also not satisfied: (iii) that the appellant had resided in  the
    United Kingdom with Mrs B after 27 November 2009 in accordance with the
    2006 Regulations for a continuous period of five years,  or  (iv)  that
    Mrs B was a qualified person on 8 January 2016 or that she was  an  EEA
    national with a permanent right of residence on 8 January 2016.

16. The Judge was wrong to treat  marital  cohabitation  for  a  continuous
    period of  five  years  as  being  a  relevant  requirement  of  either
    Regulation 10 or Regulation 15. However,  the  Judge's  error  in  this
    regard was not material, as in the course of his  lengthy  decision  he
    also addressed the right questions; and he gave  comprehensive  reasons
    for making the following two crucial findings: (a) that  the  appellant
    had  not  discharged  the  burden  of  proving  on   the   balance   of
    probabilities that Mrs B was exercising Treaty rights at  the  date  of
    divorce, and was thereby a qualified person at the date of divorce;  or
    (b) that Mrs B had continuously exercised Treaty rights for a period of
    five years so as to have acquired a permanent right of residence  by  8
    January 2016.

Ground 2

17. There is no challenge in the grounds of appeal to the  Judge's  adverse
    credibility  findings  on  the  issue  of   the   ex-spouse's   alleged
    involvement in Navtrader UK Ltd.

18. At paragraphs [21] to [23] (page 17), the Judge gave  detailed  reasons
    for finding that the  ex-spouse's  claimed  employment  with  Brasilian
    Dreams Ltd in the tax years 2009/2010 and 2010/2011  was  not  genuine.
    There is also no error of law challenge to this finding.

19. However, in line with what is effectively Ground 2, Mr Mustapha submits
    that the Judge was wrong to find that the ex-spouse had  not  exercised
    Treaty rights as a self-employed cleaner for  a  continuous  period  of
    five years.

20. The appellant claimed that Mrs B had been a self-employed cleaner since
    12 May 2010.  On the basis of her returns to HMRC,  Mrs  B  declared  a
    profit from self-employment as a cleaner of �5,200 in the year 2013/14,
    a profit of just over �6,000 in the  year  2014/15,  and  a  profit  of
    �5,457 in the year 2015/16.

21. As the Judge observed at  paragraph  [24],  there  was  no  documentary
    evidence to show that Mrs B had carried on business as a  self-employed
    cleaner in the tax years 2010/11, 2011/12 or 2012/13.  There  was  also
    no evidence of any net profit or loss from self-employment having  been
    declared by Mrs B to HMRC for those tax years.

22. I consider that the Judge gave adequate reasons for  finding  that  the
    appellant had not discharged the burden  of  proving  that  Mrs  B  was
    exercising Treaty rights as a cleaner at all in those three tax  years.



23. It therefore follows that, even if she  was  exercising  Treaty  rights
    thereafter, it was not possible for her to have exercised Treaty rights
    for a continuous period of five years prior to  the  date  of  divorce.
    Thus, on any view, she had not acquired a permanent right of  residence
    by the date of divorce.

24. Whilst acknowledging that the evidence relating to the last  three  tax
    years was stronger, the Judge was nonetheless not satisfied that the ex-
    spouse had been in genuine self-employment as a  cleaner;  or,  if  she
    was, that her activity was "effective and genuine"  rather  than  being
    "clearly marginal and ancillary"; or (in the further  alternative),  if
    her activities were effective and genuine, that they had been conducted
    continuously throughout each relevant tax year.

25. The Judge's reasoning included the fact that there was no detail of how
    the net profit figures for the three  tax  years  were  calculated  and
    arrived at: specifically, what the gross turnover was in each of  those
    years; what the totals of those expenses incurred were in each of those
    three years; and how those expenses were broken down.   It  was  to  be
    expected that she would have given those details in the tax returns for
    those three tax years, and there would have  been  a  Profit  and  Loss
    account drawn up by an accountant.

26. The same lines of reasoning underlay the Judge's  conclusion  that  the
    appellant had not discharged the burden of proving that  his  ex-spouse
    was exercising Treaty rights as a cleaner at the date of divorce.

27. Mr Mustapha submits that  the  Judge  erred  in  law  in  treating  the
    declared profits for the last three tax years as being purely  marginal
    and ancillary; and that he had also erred in law in not  treating  them
    as being generated throughout the year, with the consequence  that  the
    ex-spouse was probably exercising Treaty rights at the date of divorce.
     However, Mr Mustapha's error of law challenge ignores  the  fact  that
    the Judge did not accept that  the  ex-spouse  had  in  fact  genuinely
    earned any of the net profits which she had declared to HMRC.

28. It was unarguably open to the Judge to find, for the extensive  reasons
    which he gave, that the net profits declared to HMRC - which  were  not
    at a level which would trigger a liability to tax - were  not  reliable
    evidence of the ex-spouse having genuinely carried on economic activity
    in those tax years as a self-employed cleaner.

Ground 3

29. Ground 3 is that the Judge made contradictory  findings  at  paragraphs
    [19] and [20] concerning the appellant.  This ground was not  developed
    before me by Mr Mustapha, and it has no merit.  At paragraph [19],  the
    Judge held that the appellant was not in  employment  at  the  date  of
    divorce. But he accepted at paragraph [20] that, both before and  after
    8 January 2016, the appellant was working on a self-employed basis as a
    driver for Uber.

Ground 4

30. Ground 4 is that the Judge erred in law in not taking into account that
    it had been open to the respondent to contact HMRC in order  to  secure
    further evidence to  make  an  informed  decision  on  the  appellant's
    application.  This ground also has no merit for two reasons.   Firstly,
    on the appellant's account, the ex-spouse had cooperated  with  him  in
    providing some documentary evidence  relating  to  her  asserted  self-
    employment as a cleaner.  Secondly, it was only Mrs B,  not  HMRC,  who
    was in the position to provide documentary proof that  the  net  profit
    figures declared to HMRC were reliable.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
