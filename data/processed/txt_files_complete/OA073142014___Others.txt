For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison (HOPO)
Interpreter:     Mr Chmaissani

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants, citizen of Kuwait, are all siblings and  they  are  the
    children of the two Sponsors, Toama Al Fawzan and Mariha Yasin  Awayid.
    They had applied for entry clearance under paragraph 352D  HC  395  but
    the respondent  refused  their  applications  on  June  2,  2014  under
    paragraphs 320(3) & (10) and 352D HC 395. The appellants appealed those
    decisions on June 24, 2014 under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 2. The appeal came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Mulvenna  on
    July 2, 2015 and  he  allowed  the  appeals  of  the  first  two  named
    appellants under  the  Immigration  Rules  but  refused  the  remaining
    applications under both the Immigration Rules and ECHR legislation in a
    decision promulgated on July 2, 2015.

 3. Both parties appealed that decision and when the matter came before  me
    on January 29, 2016 I accepted there had been errors in law  as  argued
    by both parties and I directed that the matter be listed for a  further
    hearing and I made the following findings for the  purpose  of  today's
    hearing:

     a. All of the appellants are the children of both sponsors.


     b. The first two-named appellants are under the age of eighteen.

     c. The remaining appellants were found to be over the age of  eighteen
        at the date of application. If the appellants  maintain  they  were
        under the age of eighteen, then further evidence would be necessary
        to persuade me to depart from the  First-tier  Judge's  finding  on
        this issue.


     d. Did  the  translated  birth  documents  mean  the  appellants  were
        documented Bidoons?

     e. As the appellants are all siblings would it be disproportionate  to
        refuse them all entry, even if some of them are  over  the  age  of
        eighteen?

 4. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make no order now.


    PRELIMINARY ISSUES


 5. Mr Harrison adduced in evidence a section of the  appellants'  father's
    screening interview in which  dates  of  birth  had  been  written.  Mr
    Harrison stated, having checked with  colleagues,  that  he  could  not
    verify the authenticity of the birth documents and  he  accepted  these
    documents did not mean the appellants were documented. As the  sponsors
    had been accepted as  undocumented  Mr  Harrison  accepted  that  these
    appellants must also be treated as undocumented in the absence  of  any
    evidence to the contrary,


 6. Mr Sadiq produced  correspondence  from  when  the  appellants'  father
    claimed asylum that set out the ages of  the  appellants  and  he  also
    handed  over  the  original  birth  documents.  Translations  of  these
    documents appeared in the respondent's bundle  and  Mr  Harrison  later
    confirmed that these documents had been given to  the  respondent  when
    the application was submitted.

    EVIDENCE

 7. Mr Toama Al Fawzan gave evidence through the  interpreter  and  adopted
    his two witness statements. In answer to questions posed by Mr Harrison
    he confirmed:


     a. In addition to these appellants he had three  other  daughters  who
        were married and living with their husbands and children in Kuwait.
        They were all undocumented but one of his daughters was married  to
        a documented Kuwaiti. He had occasional telephone contact with them
        but the last contact was three months ago.


     b. The appellants were taken to Jordan after he and his wife had  been
        granted discretionary leave to  remain.  They  had  travelled  from
        Kuwait to Jordan hidden in carts.

     c. The original birth documents had been given to him around ten  days
        after each child had been born. He agreed each document looked  the
        same as they were same colour. He explained that each document  was
        placed in a suitcase and they had been folded which  explained  why
        they were in good condition and had folds in the  same  place.  The
        documents were only there to prove that the appellants  were  their
        children.

     d. He spoke to the appellants on the internet and he and his wife  had
        travelled to see them on four occasions between April 2014 and  May
        2015 with each of them travelling on two occasions. They  were  now
        unable to travel because of additional financial requirement placed
        on visitors by the Jordanian government.

     e. They received around �850 a month plus  housing  benefit  and  sent
        around �200  to  Jordan  for  their  children.  Evidence  of  money
        transfers had been submitted. They had also borrowed money  on  two
        occasions to fund trips to see them.

 8. Mr Toama Al Fawzan further stated that neither  he  nor  his  wife  had
    travelled to Kuwait  to  see  their  other  children  and  their  other
    children had been unable to travel to  Jordan  to  see  the  appellants
    because they were undocumented Bidoons.




    SUBMISSIONS


 9. Mr Harrison submitted  that  on  the  evidence  available  two  of  the
    children were under the age of eighteen but the other four were  older.
    None of the additional evidence altered the finding made on this in the
    First-tier Tribunal. He accepted they all lived together as a family in
    Jordan albeit their living accommodation was limited to  one  room.  On
    the evidence available, he accepted none of  them  had  any  status  in
    Jordan and he also accepted they were  "undocumented  Kuwaiti  Bidoons"
    with no right to return to Kuwait. However, he submitted they  were  an
    autonomous group of individuals who looked  after  themselves.  If  the
    Tribunal concluded that the youngest two appellant's appeals should  be
    allowed then the issue for the Tribunal would be whether  it  would  be
    disproportionate to split this part of  the  family  up  and  that,  Mr
    Harrison submitted, was a matter for the  Tribunal  to  decide  but  in
    considering their claims regard should be had to Kugathas  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31.


10. Before taking submissions from Mr Sadiq, I clarified with  Mr  Harrison
    what exactly his position  was  with  regard  to  the  first  two-named
    appellants who he accepted were under the age of eighteen at  the  date
    of application.

11. Mr Harrison accepted that these two  appellants  would  have  succeeded
    under paragraph 352D HC 395 save they had  no  passports  and  that  as
    minors there was a strong argument that they should be allowed to  live
    with their parents under article 8 ECHR.

12. I indicated to Mr Sadiq that I was minded to allow the appeals  of  the
    first two-named appellants for reasons I would give later and that  his
    submissions  should  address  firstly  whether  I  should  accept   the
    remaining appellants as also  being  under  the  age  of  eighteen  and
    secondly, why  it  would  be  disproportionate  to  refuse  them  entry
    clearance if they were found to be over eighteen.

13. Mr Sadiq submitted that the First-tier Tribunal finding on  age  should
    be revisited because it had been made on a misunderstanding of how  the
    birth documents should be treated. There was  additional  evidence  now
    before  the  Tribunal  that  demonstrated  the  sponsor  had  told  the
    immigration officer when interviewed for his  asylum  claim  the  exact
    dates of birth  of  each  child.  These  ages  were  confirmed  in  the
    screening interview save for what was probably an  incorrect  recording
    of two dates  of  birth.  He  submitted  two  dates  had  clearly  been
    incorrectly recorded as 1969 instead of 1996 and 1979 instead of  1997.
    Although the birth documents were in  a  good  condition  he  submitted
    applying the principles of  Tanveer  Ahmed  [2002]  UKIAT  00439  these
    documents should be considered in the round with the other evidence. He
    referred me to the Home Office's own guidance  on  age  assessment  and
    submitted each of the appellants should be accepted as under eighteen.

14. However, if the Tribunal considered the remaining appellants to be over
    the age of eighteen then he submitted that separating the family  would
    be disproportionate. They were young adults who had no legal status  in
    Jordan having travelled there illegally intending to try and join their
    parents in the United Kingdom. They were stateless  because  they  were
    undocumented  and  their  situation  was  both  unique,   unusual   and
    exceptional. There was also medical  evidence  about  the  fourth-named
    appellant which showed he suffered with neuromuscular dystrophy and was
    in need of both medical  assistance  and  the  love  and  care  of  his
    parents. They remained  financially  dependent  on  their  parents  and
    refusing their applications would be disproportionate.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

15. The sponsors are the parents of nine children. Three of those  children
    are accepted as being over the age of eighteen and  living  independent
    lives when the sponsors left Kuwait  and  came  here  and  applied  for
    asylum as undocumented Bidoons. They are married and apparently  living
    safely with their husbands  and  children.  Whilst  they  may  also  be
    undocumented Bidoons they have made their own lives  and  do  not  form
    part of the applications before me.


16. The history of this case makes sad reading because  their  applications
    were lodged in  April  2014  but  were  rejected  because  firstly  the
    respondent was not satisfied they were related as claimed; secondly  as
    undocumented Bidoons they could not satisfy paragraph 352D and thirdly,
    there was an issue over their ages.

17. By the time their appeals came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  DNA
    tests had been carried out and they  conclusively  confirmed  that  the
    sponsors were the parents of all of the appellants. Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Mulvenna accepted the first two appellants were under the
    age of eighteen and that finding remains unchallenged today.  He  found
    that as undocumented Bidoons they were not able to produce passports as
    evidence of nationality and identity and he allowed their appeals under
    the Immigration Rules under the family reunion  policy.  Unfortunately,
    for reasons previously stated, that amounted to an  error  in  law  and
    that decision had to be set aside. He did not make  any  finding  under
    article 8 ECHR and that is the first matter I intend to address.

18.  The  respondent  previously  agreed  that  these  claims  fell  to  be
    considered under article 8 and applying the tests  set  out  in  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 00027 I accept that there is family life between the first-
    two named appellants  and  the  sponsors.  Refusing  them  entry  would
    interfere with that right and as they did not satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules it is in accordance with the law for one of the  legitimate  aims
    set out in article 8(2) ECHR.

19. The issue was one of proportionality and in considering this I have  to
    have regard to Section 117B of  the  2002  Act  as  introduced  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014. Whilst I accept  neither  the  sponsors  nor  the
    appellants speak English and the sponsors receive public funds  I  must
    have regard to the fact the appellants are minors of parents  who  have
    been accepted as refugees who would have qualified under paragraph 352D
    HC 395 but for the fact they have no documents. There is no evidence to
    suggest that the sponsors could relocate to live in Jordan. There is  a
    strong presumption for children to live with their  parents  and  I  am
    satisfied  that  in  light  of  the  respondent's  recognition  of  the
    sponsors' status in this country and their current living  arrangements
    and status in Jordan that refusing the first two-named appellants entry
    clearance would be disproportionate. I therefore allow first  two-named
    appellants' appeals under article 8 ECHR.

20. Turning to the remaining appellants I have to consider whether they are
    eighteen or under when their applications were lodged.

21. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mulvenna had limited  evidence  before
    him about their ages. He had translated birth documents and  the  entry
    clearance officer's own assessment. It was argued before  him  that  he
    should be careful to accept a subjective view of  the  entry  clearance
    officer and at paragraph [19] of the decision he reminded himself  that
    the Tribunal should decide the case on the evidence  presented.  As  he
    only had a translated form entitled "A Live Born  Statement"  for  each
    appellant he concluded the appellants had not satisfied the  burden  of
    proof placed on them following the decision of Rawolfi (age assessment-
    standard of proof) [2012] UKUT 00197.

22. I made it clear at the earlier hearing that for  me  to  re-visit  this
    issue further evidence would have to be adduced. I have  been  provided
    with further evidence and that evidence relates to information provided
    by the appellants' father when he was interviewed for his asylum  claim
    and details entered on the screening interview. I was  also  shown  the
    originals of the translated forms and Mr Harrison confirmed that  these
    had actually been handed to the respondent when the  applications  were
    submitted.

23. It follows therefore that I had more  information  than  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Mulvenna. I  also  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellants' father who explained his family circumstances. The position
    prior to him coming to the United Kingdom was that he, his wife and the
    appellants all lived together in Kuwait but  his  older  children  were
    married and lived with their husbands.

24. Whilst I have some reservations  about  the  original  birth  documents
    (produced at the hearing)  due  to  their  pristine  condition  I  must
    consider them in the round. The respondent does not  suggest  they  are
    forgeries and Mr Harrison accepted they matched the documents shown  to
    them in 2014. His own enquiry about these documents revealed  it  would
    be impossible to give a definitive answer as to their origin.

25. Having reconsidered all of the available evidence I  am  satisfied,  on
    balance of probabilities, that all of the appellants were under the age
    of eighteen and are therefore entitled to be treated in the same way as
    their other two appellants whose appeals I addressed earlier.

26. I should add that even if I had concluded they were  over  the  age  of
    eighteen I do believe that  it  would  have  been  disproportionate  to
    separate this family bearing in mind they had no legal status in either
    Jordan  or  Kuwait,  they  had  no  income  and  were  being  supported
    emotionally and financially by their parents. There was  evidence  that
    their mother had spent seven months with them between June 2014 and May
    2015 and their father had spent almost eight weeks  with  them  between
    April and August 2014.

27.  Applying  the  tests  laid  out  in  Kugathas,  Ghising   and   others
    (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic wrong; weight) [2013]  UKUT  00567  (IAC)  and
    Gurung & Others v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 8 I find there  is  a  requisite
    degree of emotional dependence  over  and  above  the  usual  emotional
    bonds. The Court's approach in Gurung, to the issue of family life,  is
    set out in paragraphs [45] to [46]. The court stated-
         "45.     Ultimately, the  question  whether  an  individual  enjoys
         family life is one of fact and depends on a  careful  consideration
         of all the  relevant  facts  of  the  particular  case...  in  some
         instances an adult child  (particularly  if  he  does  not  have  a
         partner or children of his own) may establish that he has a  family
         life with his parents. It all depends on the facts.
         46.      ... Paras 50 to 62 of  the  determination  of  the  UT  in
         Ghising contains a useful review of some of the  jurisprudence  and
         the correct approach to be adopted. It concludes at  para  62  that
         the different outcomes in cases with superficially similar features
         emphasises to us that the issue under Article 8(1) is highly  fact-
         sensitive."
28. Accordingly, even if they had been over the age  of  eighteen  I  would
    have concluded, after considering section 117B factors,  that  in  this
    case it would be disproportionate to refuse them entry.

29. I therefore allow all of their appeals under article 8 ECHR.

30. Ideally the respondent should grant them such leave  to  coincide  with
    that issued to their parents so any future renewal can  deal  with  all
    cases together but ultimately that is a matter for the respondent.

    DECISION


31. There was a material error and I set aside the earlier decision  and  I
    have remade the decision.


32. I dismiss all appeals under the Immigration Rules.

33. I allow all appeals under article 8 ECHR.

FEE AWARD

I do not make a fee award as the decisions taken by the entry clearance
officer were open to him at the time.
