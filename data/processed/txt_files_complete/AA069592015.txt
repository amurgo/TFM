Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Timson, instructed by Rochdale Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan, born  on  1  January  1962.
    His wife (born 1 January 1964) and his sons  (born  respectively  on  1
    January 1998 and 1 January 1999)  are  dependants  on  the  appellant's
    appeal.

 2. The appellant was first encountered in the UK by Border Force officials
    in Kent on 3 October  2014,  at  which  time  he  claimed  asylum.  The
    appellant asserts, and this is accepted, that this was also the date of
    his arrival into this country.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  ("FtT")  against  a
    decision of the Secretary of State dated 1 April 2015 to remove him and
    his  dependants  from  the  United  Kingdom,  his  application  to   be
    recognised as a refugee having been refused on  the  same  date.   That
    appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley in a decision
    promulgated on 9 November 2015.

    Setting aside FtT's decision

 4. The appellant obtained permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  and
    the matter originally came before me on 27 July 2016.  On that  date  I
    set aside the FtT's decision (the  written  decision  following  on  16
    August 2016, and  attached  as  Appendix  1  hereto),  it  having  been
    accepted by Mr Harrison, acting on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State,
    that the it contained an error of law capable of affecting the  outcome
    of the appeal.

 5. In my written Decision and Reasons I stated as follows:

         "[8] ...The parties agreed that it would  be  appropriate  for  the
         appeal to be remade by the Upper Tribunal - the findings of primary
         fact made by Judge Ransley to form a starting point for  the  Upper
         Tribunal's consideration.  ..."

    Re-making of Decision

    Summary of Appellant's Claim before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The FtT summarises  the  appellant's  claim  in  paragraph  15  of  its
    decision, which for convenience I repeat herein.

        "(a)  The appellant was born  in  Sultanpur,  Afghanistan  in  1962.
             When he was young his family moved to live in Jalalabad.   The
             appellant claims that in 1983 his brother Man Singh was killed
             with several  others  outside  a  gurdwara  (Sikh  temple)  in
             Jalalabad.  The appellant did not witness the killing  because
             he was  inside  the  temple  at  the  time;  he  believed  the
             Mujahideen had carried out the killing.

         (b)  After his brother's death the appellant married his  brother's
             widow, namely Surinder Kaur in accordance  with  his  cultural
             tradition.

         (c)  In the UK the appellant has a brother named Kasan Singh who is
             now a British citizen.  The appellant claims that Kasan  Singh
             fled Afghanistan fourteen years  ago  to  save  his  life  and
             religion.

         (d)  The appellant claims that his father had owned a shop  selling
             crockery in a bazaar in Jalalabad.  After the  father's  death
             in 2007  the  appellant  continued  to  run  the  family  shop
             business.  He claims that the Taliban  came  to  his  shop  to
             demand money roughly every 40 or 50 days; they threatened that
             if he did not give them money they would kidnap his children.

         (e)  The appellant claims that about eight - ten years ago when his
             younger son Balmeet Singh was 7 years old, the Taliban came to
             his house and  had  checked  the  family.   They  hit  Balmeet
             resulting in the child having to  have  stitches  to  treat  a
             wound to his head.  The appellant tried to  stop  them  taking
             Balmeet; as a result he and  his  wife  were  assaulted.   The
             Taliban took money from the appellant and left the  house.   A
             year after the first attack some men came  with  guns  to  the
             appellant's house and tried to kidnap Balmeet.  The  appellant
             hid  Balmeet  in  a  bedroom.   The  armed  men  attacked  the
             appellant and his wife; they took money from him and left.

         (f)  Two years before leaving Afghanistan the appellant had run out
             of money to pay the rent on his shop due to the thefts of  his
             money.  He had to give up the shop business.  He  sat  in  the
             street outside his shop to sell the remaining stocks.  It took
             him three or four months to sell all the remaining stocks; no-
             one tried to take his money during  the  period  when  he  was
             selling in the street.

         (g)  The appellant left Afghanistan with his wife and two sons with
             the assistance of an agent in September  2014;  it  took  them
             twelve days to reach the UK.  They entered the UK concealed in
             a caravan on 3 October 2014; they were encountered by  the  UK
             Border Force officers and he claimed asylum on the same day."

 7. The FtT accepted the appellant to be a national of Afghanistan and also
    to be of the Sikh religion (paragraphs 21 to 27).

 8. The  FtT's  decision  thereafter  displays  the  following  significant
    features:

 i) The appellant's explanation as to why  he  did  not  leave  Afghanistan
    fourteen years previously with his  brother  Kasan  lacked  credibility
    (paragraph 30).

ii) The appellant's explanation as to why his brother had not  been  called
    as a witness in support of his  appeal  (i.e.  that  he  had  not  been
    invited to call him as a witness) lacked credibility (paragraphs 31  to
    33).

iii) The appellant's evidence that he had not intended to  come  to  the  UK
    and had not even heard of the UK prior to leaving Afghanistan  in  2014
    was not credible, given that his brother had left Afghanistan  fourteen
    years earlier to come to the United Kingdom in order to save  his  life
    (paragraph 34).

 9. In paragraphs 35 to 38 of its decision the FtT state:

             "35. The appellant claims that in Jalalabad  his  late  father
                  had owned a shop selling  crockery/chinaware.   After  his
                  father's death in 2007 the appellant continued to run  the
                  family shop.  The appellant claims that the Mujahideen and
                  the Taliban used to come to the family's shop every 40  or
                  50 days; they demanded money and threatened  that  if  the
                  appellant did not give them money they  would  kidnap  his
                  children.

             36.  Under cross-examination, it was put to the appellant that
                  in the context of his account neither the  Mujahideen  nor
                  the Taliban had physically attacked him when they came  to
                  his shop.  The appellant replied that the  Mujahideen  and
                  the Taliban did not attack  him  physically  because  they
                  were concerned that there were other  people  around.   Mr
                  Townsend argued that the Mujahideen and the  Taliban  were
                  known to be ruthless people; it is not credible that  they
                  would refrain  from  attacking  the  appellant  physically
                  merely because they were concerned about the  presence  of
                  members of the public around.  I agree with Mr Townsend.

             37.  The appellant claims that eight or ten  years  ago,  when
                  his younger son Balmeet Singh was 7 years old the  Taliban
                  came to his home and attacked the family.  They  assaulted
                  Balmeet resulting in him needing stitches to treat a wound
                  to his head.  The appellant  tried  to  stop  them  taking
                  Balmeet; during this incident he and his wife were hit  by
                  the Taliban.  The appellant described that  a  year  after
                  this first attack some men armed with  guns  came  to  the
                  family home trying to kidnap Balmeet.  He hid Balmeet in a
                  bedroom.  The armed men  punched  the  appellant  and  his
                  wife, took his money and left the house.  In my  view,  if
                  the Taliban and the armed men had come to the  appellant's
                  family home with real intention to kidnap  Balmeet,  given
                  that  the  appellant  and   his   wife   were   relatively
                  defenceless, it is not reasonably likely  that  these  men
                  would have gone away without taking Balmeet.   It  is  not
                  reasonably likely that on the second  incident  the  armed
                  men would have failed to search the house and find Balmeet
                  even if the appellant had attempted to hide Balmeet  in  a
                  bedroom as alleged.

             38.  The appellant's case is that two  years  before  he  left
                  Afghanistan he ran out of money to pay  the  rent  on  his
                  shop due to the thefts  of  his  money.   In  his  witness
                  statement the appellant described that he had to  give  up
                  the shop; thereafter he sat in the street outside  a  shop
                  to sell the remaining stocks.  He said that  he  did  this
                  for three or four months and  during  this  period  no-one
                  tried to take his money; he and his family survived on the
                  money during the two years before they  left  Afghanistan.
                  I consider it material that  the  appellant's  account  is
                  that the Taliban and others had demanded money from him by
                  coming to his shop 40 or 50  days  and  people  repeatedly
                  stopped him in the street to demand money from him.   This
                  account is at odds with his evidence that he was  able  to
                  sell the remaining stocks in the street in Jalalabad for a
                  period of three/four months without anyone trying to  take
                  any money from him, and he and his  family  were  able  to
                  live on the money he made from selling the stocks  without
                  any demand from anyone to extract money  from  him  during
                  the two year period prior to him  leaving  Afghanistan  in
                  2014."

10. Subsequently, when addressing submissions as to the  relevance  of  the
    decision in DSG & Others (Afghan Sikhs: departure from CG) [2013]  UKUT
    148 and, in particular, whether the FtT was  entitled  to  depart  from
    country guidance authority, the FtT concluded:

         "However, as submitted by Mr Townsend,  it  is  material  that  the
         account given by the claimant  in  DSG  &  Others  had  been  found
         credible by the First-tier Tribunal.  In the current appeal  before
         me, for the reasons given above I find the  account  given  by  the
         appellant to lack credibility.  I agree with Mr Townsend that DSG &
         Others can be distinguished from the current appeal."

    Evidence not before the FtT

11. Before the Upper Tribunal  the  appellant  relied  upon  an  additional
    witness statement, drawn on 19  October  2016,  which  provided,  inter
    alia, the following further evidence:

 i) He has had no contact with his mother or siblings in Afghanistan  since
    the day he left;

ii) His brother, Kasan Singh, has not heard from his family in Afghanistan;

iii) He does not know the whereabouts  of  the  family  that  were  left  in
    Afghanistan;

iv) He has no relatives in Afghanistan;

 v) He was last in Kabul 30 years ago  -  at  the  time  he  undertook  his
    military service - and he does not know anybody there now;

vi) Before he left Jalalabad he closed the family shop. He was subjected to
    extortion, which meant he could no longer afford the pay  the  rent  on
    the shop.  He subsequently sold the remaining stock on the street;

vii) His mother sold the family home and the proceeds were used to  pay  for
    the family to travel to the UK.  There  is  nothing  to  return  to  in
    Jalalabad;

viii) In Jalalabad the family had attended the gurdwara two to  three  times
    per week;

ix) His two sons are both attending  college  in  the  UK.   The  appellant
    believes that they would be denied the opportunity of an  education  if
    returned to Afghanistan.

12. In oral evidence the appellant was asked how he had become  aware  that
    his family had left Afghanistan, given that it was  also  his  evidence
    that he had had no contact with  them  since  he  left.   He  initially
    replied by indicating that the whole family had been planning to  leave
    Afghanistan together, and that they had intended to leave because there
    was no security  and  safety  in  Afghanistan  for  Sikhs.   On  closer
    questioning the appellant divulged that there had been a meeting in the
    gurdwara prior to him leaving  Afghanistan  during  which  all  of  the
    families in attendance had indicated an intention to  leave,  including
    his own family. The appellant further confirmed  that  no  arrangements
    had been made with his family members in Afghanistan to enable  contact
    after his departure.

13. Upon being asked to identify why his brother had not attended  to  give
    evidence before the Upper Tribunal, given the adverse comments made  by
    the FtT regarding his non-attendance, the appellant stated that he  had
    not been advised that his brother was required  to  attend  or  provide
    evidence.

    Submissions

14. Mr Timson asserted that the FtT  had  not  made  any  findings  on  the
    appellant's evidence that: (i) the Taliban had extorted money from  him
    which had subsequently led him to return his shop to the landlords; or,
    (ii) he had sold the remaining stock from the shop on the street  prior
    to leaving Afghanistan.  As a consequence, it was submitted, the  Upper
    Tribunal could make its own findings on this evidence and should do  so
    by accepting its truth.   In  support  of  the  latter  submission  the
    Tribunal's attention was directed to background  evidence  said  to  be
    supportive of the appellant's claim that such extortion takes place  in
    Afghanistan.

15. Mr Timson further asserted that should  the  appellant  return  to  his
    hometown he would be in the same position as he had previously been in,
    and would be unable to establish  a  business  there.  The  appellant's
    family home had been sold and the appellant and  his  family  would  be
    left destitute if returned to Afghanistan.

16. In response, Mr Bates submitted that the FtT's decision  encompassed  a
    conclusion rejecting the truth of the appellant's assertions as to  the
    demise of the  appellant's  business.  He  further  asserted  that  the
    Tribunal should reject as untruthful the appellant's evidence that  his
    family had now  left  Afghanistan.  Even  taken  at  its  highest,  the
    appellant's evidence on this issue had no evidential foundation and was
    based on nothing more than speculation.

17. Mr Bates accepted that Sikhs in Afghanistan face  some  harassment  but
    asserted, relying on TG & Others (Aghan Sikhs  persecuted)  Afghanistan
    CG [2015] UKUT 00595, that this came nowhere near the level required to
    establish a real risk of persecution.

    Decision and Discussion

18. It is uncontroversial that the burden of proof rests on  the  appellant
    and that the applicable standard of proof is a low one - i.e. is  there
    a real risk that the appellant  would  suffer  treatment  amounting  to
    persecution (or treatment of such severity so as to lead to a breach of
    Article 3) upon return to Afghanistan?

19. I first consider Mr Timson's submission that the FtT failed to make any
    findings in relation to the appellant's evidence of the demise  of  the
    family business and the reasons for, and consequences of, such.

20. The FtT findings of fact on core  issues,  and  the  reasons  for  such
    findings, are to be found in paragraphs 29 onwards of its decision - as
    is made explicit by the  terms  of  paragraph  28  thereof.  The  FtT's
    reasoning points in one direction i.e. that it found the core  elements
    of the account given by the appellant to lack credibility, save for the
    evidence regarding his nationality  and  religion.   The  rationale  in
    paragraphs 29 to 39 of the FtT's decision culminates in a conclusion in
    paragraph 42 that: "for the reasons given  above  I  find  the  account
    given by the appellant to lack credibility."

21. Although Mr Timson sought to hive off the  rationale  in  paragraph  38
    from the overarching finding at paragraph 42, asserting that it was not
    sufficient to reject the truth  of  the  appellant's  account  of  such
    matters on the basis set out there, I reject this submission.

22. If there is any doubt that the FtT considered one of the core  elements
    of the appellant's claim to be his assertion as to  the  fact  of,  and
    circumstances surrounding, the demise of the family business,  this  is
    dispelled by the rationale  found  in  paragraphs  36  and  38  of  its
    decision. It is plain, in my view, that such matters  were  within  the
    FtT's mind when identifying the overarching credibility finding set out
    in paragraph  42.  The  FtT  rejected  the  truth  of  the  appellant's
    assertions that he was the subject of extortion by the  Mujahedeen  and
    the Taliban, that he had to 'give up' his shop  as  a  consequence  and
    that he sold the remaining stock from the shop on the street  prior  to
    his departure.

23. In any event, having considered the evidence in the round for myself  I
    reject as  untruthful  the  account  given  by  the  appellant  in  the
    aforementioned  regard.  As  identified  earlier,  there  has  been   a
    comprehensive rejection of other elements of the  appellant's  account,
    save for the appellant's nationality and religion.  The  reasoning  set
    out in paragraphs 36 and 38 of the FtT's  decision  clearly  identifies
    issues as to the plausibility of the account  given  by  the  appellant
    and, although the background evidence supports the assertion  that  the
    Taliban do extort money  from  Sikhs,  that  does  not  mean  that  the
    appellant's account in this regard is truthful.  Nothing  said  by  the
    appellant previously, or before me, leads me to find, in the context of
    the evidence as a whole,  that  the  appellant  has  given  a  truthful
    account of the demise of his business  and  the  consequences  thereof,
    even to the lower standard.

24. Moving on, I am required ultimately to determine  whether  there  is  a
    real  risk  of  the  appellant  and/or  his  dependent  family  members
    suffering from persecutory treatment upon return to Afghanistan on  the
    established factual matrix.

25. Key to the appellant's claim is that he  would  face  destitution  upon
    return or, alternatively, he  would  have  insufficient  resources,  or
    ability to obtain such resources, so as to  enable  to  the  family  to
    integrate back into society in Afghanistan thus leaving them even  more
    exposed to harassment and discrimination than  would  normally  be  the
    case for a Sikh - to such an extent that he, and  his  family  members,
    would be subjected to persecution.

26. The appellant asserts that he has no family  left  in  Afghanistan  who
    could provide support and assistance upon return. I do not accept  that
    the appellant has established, even to the lower standard, that this is
    so. The appellant's assertion in this regard  is,  even  taken  at  its
    highest, speculative. He founds his  evidence  on  (a)  the  prevailing
    circumstances for Sikhs in Afghanistan and (b)  an  agreement  said  to
    have taken place between all of the families that attended a meeting at
    the gurdwara, prior to the appellant's departure.

27. The appellant claims to have had no contact  with  his  family  members
    -with whom he had close ties in Afghanistan - since he left and that no
    plans were put in place for such contact to be made. The evidence lacks
    plausibility. However, even if it is plausible I nevertheless  find  it
    untruthful. The appellant has not provided any  evidence  that  he  has
    made attempts to contact his family since his departure, either at  the
    address they were  living  at  prior  to  such  departure  or  via  the
    gurdwara. Such attempts could have borne fruit but, even  if  they  did
    not, this very fact would be  supportive  of  the  assertion  that  the
    family members had left the appellant's home area, as  claimed.  As  it
    is, the appellant seeks to rest his claim in this regard on speculation
    supported by his own inaction.

28. I further observe that the appellant's brother did  not  give  evidence
    before the Upper Tribunal, despite the criticism  by  the  FtT  of  his
    failure to previously do so. This evidence could, at  the  very  least,
    have  provided  some  support  to  the  appellant's   assertions.   The
    explanation provided by the appellant lacks credibility in light of the
    terms of paragraph 33 of the FtT's decision.

29. For the above reasons, even  absent  taking  account  of  the  negative
    credibility conclusions of the FtT, I would  have  concluded  that  the
    appellant's evidence regarding the whereabouts of his  family  members,
    whom he left in Afghanistan, are untruthful and, even if truthful  does
    not establish to the lower standard  that  the  family  have  now  left
    Afghanistan.  This conclusion is only reinforced when  the  appellant's
    evidence in this regard is considered  in  the  context  of  the  FtT's
    conclusion that the core of the appellant's account lacks truth.

30. Looking at all the evidence as  a  whole  I  do  not  accept  that  the
    appellant has demonstrated, even to the lower standard, that he has  no
    family in Afghanistan to return to, or that such family as he does have
    would not support him upon return.

31. Furthermore, there is no credible  evidence  that  the  appellant's  UK
    based brother could not provide financial support to the  appellant  if
    he were to return to Afghanistan. Both the appellant  and  his  brother
    could have given evidence on this issue, and in  particular  about  the
    inability or unwillingness of the appellant's brother to  provide  such
    funds, with supporting documentation being produced to demonstrate  any
    claimed inability. As it is there is a vacuum in the evidence  in  this
    regard.

32. In addition, there is no evidence to establish that the gurdwara  would
    be unable or unwilling to provide assistance to the appellant  and  his
    family upon their return to Jalabad, which is particularly relevant  in
    light of what is said at paragraphs 109 and  110  of  TG  where  it  is
    identified that gurdwaras,  in  accordance  with  the  Sikh  and  Hindu
    tradition, provide food aid, shelter and a degree of companionship  and
    protection; albeit that declining numbers  and  economic  wellbeing  of
    those remaining in Afghanistan has an impact  on  the  ability  of  the
    gurdwara to continue to provide such hospitality and support.

33. Assessing the level of risk to the appellant and  his  dependents  upon
    return I have taken full account of the country guidance decision in TG
    and others.  It is clear that some members of  the  Sikh  community  in
    Afghanistan continue to suffer harassment at the hands of Muslims  but,
    following the conclusions in TG, it is not the case that being  a  Sikh
    per se in Afghanistan (even if below the age of 18)  is  sufficient  to
    demonstrate that there is a real risk of being persecuted (or suffering
    from Article 3 level ill-treatment) in Jalalabad,  or  on  the  journey
    between Kabul (the point of return) and Jalalabad.

34. Mr Timson submitted that it would be  in  the  best  interests  of  the
    children to remain in the United Kingdom and that this is a feature  of
    the appellant's claim that must be taken into account both in  relation
    to Article 3 and Article 8.

35. I observe that only one of the children is under the age of 18 now and,
    consequently, it is only in  relation  to  that  child  that  the  best
    interest consideration must be undertaken. As to the Article 3 claim, I
    have taken full account of  the  children's  ages  when  coming  to  my
    conclusion  and,  in  particular,  proceeded  on  the  basis  that  the
    circumstances in which a child can be required to  live  would  not  be
    akin to that expected of an adult. I  have  also  taken  into  account,
    inter alia, all matters referred in paragraphs 94 and 95 of TG.

36. As already identified, on the findings of fact made the  appellant  has
    not been able to demonstrate, even to the lower  standard,  that  there
    would be a real risk of a lack of support from family members living in
    Afghanistan upon his return to Jalalabad.  It has also, in  any  event,
    not been demonstrated that either the  gurdwara  in  Jalalabad  or  the
    appellant's family members living in the United Kingdom would  not,  or
    could  not,  provide  financial  support  to  the  appellant  and   his
    dependents upon their return to Afghanistan, such as  to  prevent  them
    from living in conditions constituting an Article 3 breach.  These  are
    matters for the appellant to demonstrate and he  has  not  successfully
    done so, even to the lower standard.

37.  As  to  Mr  Timson's  submission  that  the  children   would   suffer
    discrimination in their educational opportunities in Afghanistan,  once
    again I draw attention to the  ages  of  the  children.   There  is  no
    indication in the evidence before me, at least no evidence that I  have
    been drawn to, that there is an entitlement for persons of 17� and  18�
    years of age to undertake education in Afghanistan.  Nevertheless, even
    had there been such a denial of opportunity it  does  not,  even  taken
    together with all other matters  identified  in  the  country  guidance
    decision, lead me to conclude that the appellant  has  established  the
    existence of a  real  risk  of  persecutory  treatment  or  other  ill-
    treatment contrary to Article 3.

38. Looking at the evidence as a whole, and for all the reasons  identified
    above, I conclude that the appellant cannot make out his case under the
    Refugee Convention, or Article 3 ECHR. No submissions were made to  the
    effect that the appellant would be entitled to humanitarian protection.
    In any event, I reject this ground for the reasons previously given  in
    relation to the Refugee Convention/Article ECHR grounds.

39. As to Article 8 ECHR, the appellant did not  place  any  reliance  upon
    this ground at the hearing before the FtT  (see  paragraph  49  of  the
    FtT's decision), neither was any application made, at  least  prior  to
    closing submissions, that the Upper Tribunal should enlarge  the  scope
    of its consideration to determine such issue. Even  if  the  making  of
    such an application can be taken to be implicit from the production  of
    evidence sent under cover of a fax of 19 October 2016, there  has  been
    no satisfactory explanation provided as  to  why  this  issue  was  not
    raised earlier. Looking at the circumstances as a whole,  I  refuse  to
    exercise my discretion to widen the scope of the re-making to include a
    consideration of Article 8.

40. In any event, had I considered this ground I would have rejected it.

41. It is not asserted that the appellant meets  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, and, in any event, I conclude that he does not.

42. The family unit will be removed together and I find that it would be in
    the best interests of the minor (17 � year old) appellant to leave  the
    United Kingdom with his family members so that the  family  can  remain
    living together.

43. I accept that removal would interfere with the private life of each  of
    the  family  members,  and  it  would  mean  ending   the   educational
    opportunities provided  to  the  children  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    circumstances where there is a real prospect of them not be able to re-
    establish such education in  Afghanistan.  Nevertheless,  the  family's
    private life has been built up at a time when  their  right  to  remain
    here was precarious, and there claim to  require  protection  has  been
    found not to have been made out.

44. Despite there being some discrimination and harassment faced  by  Sikhs
    in Afghanistan, as identified in TG, I find, when the circumstances are
    looked at as a whole (and having taken into account those  matters  set
    out in section 117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002) that the appellant's removal  (along  with  the  removal  of  his
    dependent family members) would be proportionate. Consequently,  had  I
    considered the Article 8 ground  I  would  have  dismissed  the  appeal
    brought in relation to it.

Notice of Decision

For reason set out in my  decision  of  16  August  2016  I  set  aside  the
decision of the FtT.

Upon remaking the decision on appeal I dismiss it on all grounds.

                                 APPENDIX 1


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan, of Sikh religion, born on 1
    January 1962.  His wife and two children, born respectively  1  January
    1998 and 1 January 1999, are dependants in this appeal.

45. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of
    the Secretary of State, dated 1 April 2015,  to  remove  him,  and  his
    dependants, from  the  United  Kingdom.   He  had  previously  made  an
    application to be recognised as a refugee, such application also  being
    refused on 1 April 2015.

FtT's decision

46. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley heard the  appellant's  appeal  on  3
    November 2015 and dismissed it in a decision promulgated on 9 November.
    Whilst the judge  accepted  the  appellant's  nationality  and  claimed
    religion, she dismissed the appeal, finding the account  given  by  the
    appellant as to why he had  fled  Afghanistan  "to  lack  credibility".
    Thereafter the judge concluded as follows:

         "43. The Tribunal in SL & Others found that Sikhs can  be  returned
             to Kabul where there is sufficiency of  State  protection  for
             them.

         44.  Mr Townsend drew my attention to the  RadioFreeEurope  article
             dated 19th August 2014 entitled 'When  Are  You  Going  Back?:
             Afghanistan's Sikhs.  Strangers  in  their  Own  Land'.   This
             report stated,  among  other  things,  that  the  Ministry  of
             Education had opened two primary schools exclusively for Sikhs
             and Hindu children in  Kabul  and  Jalalabad  in  response  to
             complaints from these minority groups of being harassed.

         45.  In considering the issue of internal  relocation  to  Kabul  I
             take into account that at the asylum interview  the  Appellant
             said that he had undertaken military service for  three  years
             in Kabul.

         46.  Taking all the above into account, I find that  the  Appellant
             has failed to discharge the burden of proof that he would face
             a real risk of persecution on the ground of  his  religion  if
             returned to Afghanistan."

Discussion and Conclusion

47. On the very same day that judge Ransley's decision was promulgated  the
    Upper Tribunal placed on its website a new  country  guidance  decision
    relating to Sikhs in Afghanistan - namely TG  &  Others  (Afghan  Sikhs
    persecuted) Afghanistan CG [2015] UKUT 00595.  For  reasons  which  are
    obvious Judge Ransley did not take account  of  the  contents  of  this
    country guidance decision.

48. Before the Upper  Tribunal  Mr  Harrison  conceded  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State that judge Ransley had erred,  although  through  no
    fault of her own, in not taking into account the aforementioned country
    guidance decision.  He further accepted that such failure was, in  this
    particular case, capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal because
    there were aspects of the CG decision which called for findings of fact
    to be made on issues that judge Ransley had made no  findings  on  e.g.
    the circumstances the children would face  upon  return  in  particular
    with their education; the possibility of the appellant and  his  family
    not being able  to  financially  sustain  themselves  upon  return  and
    whether the family will be able to obtain accommodation.

49. In light of the aforementioned Mr Harrison agreed that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision should be set aside and that the  decision  on  the
    appeal be re-made in light of the most recent country guidance decision
    of TG.

50. This is the course which I conclude is appropriate in this case.

51. The parties agreed that it would be appropriate for the appeal to be re-
    made by the Upper Tribunal - the findings of primary fact made by judge
    Ransley  to  form  the  starting  point  for   the   Upper   Tribunal's
    consideration.  Unfortunately, this task could not be undertaken at the
    hearing on 27 July because of the absence of an interpreter.  Given the
    importance of the appellant being  given  the  opportunity  to  provide
    evidence on those matters identified in paragraph 5 above, I  adjourned
    the re-making of the decision to a later date.

Decision

    The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  an  error  of  law
    capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal  and  is  therefore  set
    aside.
