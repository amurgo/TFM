                                   Before

                  The Hon. Mr Justice McCloskey, President,

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent




Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Jebb, of Counsel, instructed by Nelson
                    Singleton Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                                  DECISION

 1. The Appellant appeals to the First-tier Tribunal  ("FtT")  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State refusing his claim for asylum, dated
    19 February 2015. The Secretary of State had decided,  in  a  nutshell,
    that while  the  Appellant's  claim  to  be  a  Sudanese  national  was
    accepted, his claim of risk upon return to Sudan due  to  his  asserted
    involvement with a specific student organisation and the group "Grifni"
    or on account of his race or ethnicity fell to be  rejected.   The  FtT
    dismissed the ensuing appeal.


 2. Permission to appeal was granted in the following terms:


         "The application for permission to appeal asserts that the decision
         is generic and, mostly, does not even  use  the  Appellant's  name;
         fails to address credibility; fails to address risk in Sudan; fails
         to address the evidence of [the] expert witness; fails to apply  AA
         Sudan  or  MM  Darfuris  and  is  merely  formulaic  in  that   the
         conclusions are mere recitation of basic legal principles which are
         then held to count  against  the  Appellant  ....  The  grounds  of
         application, seriatim, are arguable."




      It was conceded on behalf of the Secretary of State that the  decision
      of the FtT is unsustainable.  This  concession  embraces  all  of  the
      factors highlighted in the grant of permission  to  appeal.  I  accept
      this concession.


DECISION


 3. On the basis set forth above, the decision of the  FtT  is  hereby  set
    aside and I remit the appeal to a differently constituted FtT  for  the
    purpose of rehearing.  This is plainly a case in which remittal is  the
    appropriate course.









                                               THE HON. MR JUSTICE MCCLOSKEY
                                             PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
