                               DECISION AND REASONS


   1. The respondent, a citizen of South Korea, applied for indefinite leave
      to remain on the basis of ten years' residence.   The application  was
      refused because the appellant concluded that there had been breaks  in
      the continuous residence.  A First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  an  appeal
      against the decision. The judge concluded that the first gap  was,  in
      law, not a gap at all and  the second was one  that  should  not  have
      been treated as a gap and in any event,  should  she  be  wrong  about
      those matters she would have allowed the appeal under article 8 of the
      ECHR. Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds.


   2. The first ground of appeal concerns the first gap. The facts  are  not
      in dispute. The respondent had valid leave until 30 June 2004  and  so
      was an overstayer until she left the United Kingdom on 4 July 2004. On
      29 August 2004 she re-entered the United Kingdom with valid leave.

   3. The relevant law is to be found in paragraphs 276A(a) and  276B(v)  of
      the Immigration Rules. Paragraph 276A(a) reads:

             "continuous residence" means residence in the  United  Kingdom
             for an unbroken period, and for these purposes a period  shall
             not be considered to be broken where an  applicant  is  absent
             for a  period of six months or less at any one time,  provided
             that the applicant in question has existing limited leave   to
             enter or remain upon their departure and return.

   4. Paragraph 276B(v) reads:

             the applicant must not be in the United Kingdom in  breach  of
             immigration laws except that  overstaying for a period  of  28
             Days or less will be disregarded.

   5. The grounds of appeal argue that the respondent falls foul of 276A(a).
      She was absent from the United Kingdom for a period of less  than  six
      months and she did not have leave to remain when she departed.  I have
      to say that I do not understand the judge's reasoning at paragraph  24
      of the determination, where she talks of periods of overstaying  being
      disregarded. Here it is not the  overstaying  alone  that  breaks  the
      continuous residence but the fact that the  respondent  did  not  have
      leave both on departure and return in connection with her absence.


   6. The respondent was granted leave until 31 October 2007 and she did not
      apply for further leave until 24 July 2008 and she was in fact granted
      further leave on 16 February   2010 until 31 October 2010. There was a
      gap of nine months until the application was made and of two years and
      three months before leave was granted. It is not necessary to consider
      whether the leave is retrospective[1] as  there  is  in  any  event  a
      considerable gap. The respondent had argued that  the  delay  was  the
      fault of her solicitors.

   7. The judge concluded that  the  appellant  should  have  exercised  her
      discretion and disregarded  the  gap  as  it  was  the  fault  of  the
      respondent's solicitors. She therefore (I do not entirely  follow  the
      logic as the gap was clearly  there)  concluded  that  the  respondent
      could show ten years' continuous  residence.  The  grounds  of  appeal
      accept that there was a discretion to overlook  gaps,  but  note  that
      significantly, negligence by a  representative  is  not  given  as  an
      example of  something  that  may  lead  a  caseworker  to  exercise  a
      discretion outside the rules.

   8. In fact the respondent did consider whether to exercise  a  discretion
      outside the rules  in  the  light  of  what  the  appellant  had  said
      concerning her representatives; see the first whole paragraph on  page
      3 of the Reasons for  Refusal  Letter.  As  the  discretion  has  been
      considered, and it is  a  discretion  outside  the  rules,  a    fresh
      discretion cannot be exercised unless it can be said that the exercise
      was not exercised in accordance with the law. That  may  be  the  case
      where the discretion is exercised  on  a  false  basis  or  where  the
      exercise is perverse.

   9. The judge said that it  was  unreasonable  of  the  appellant  not  to
      exercise her discretion in the respondent's favour when she  had  done
      so previously when an out of time application had been made. It is not
      clear to me that a discretion was exercised on that occasion,  but  if
      it was the situation was quite different as then the appellant clearly
      met the requirements of the rules. On this occasion she did not and  I
      can see nothing perverse or irrational in  the  respondent's  decision
      not to overlook the considerable gap in the "continuous residence" and
      exercise a discretion in her favour outside the rules.


  10. The judge erred in law with regard to her treatment of  the  law  with
      regard to all these matters and on the evidence before her the  appeal
      of the Home Office should have been allowed.

  11. The remaining grounds of appeal deal with  the  judge's  treatment  of
      article 8. Given the date of the application the   judge  should  have
      dealt with family and private life under appendix FM. She did  not  do
      so. This would amount to an error of law because any consideration  of
      article 8 outside the rules has to take  into  consideration  why  the
      application failed under the rules as that is clearly relevant  as  to
      whether the case is one of those rare cases that need to be considered
      outside the rules.   The matter was so considered in the  Reasons  for
      Refusal Letter and I can only conclude that the judge did not consider
      it because she concluded that there was no chance of success  by  that
      path.

  12. The grounds of appeal  argue  that  the  judge  in  carrying  out  the
      proportionality exercise   did  not  give  sufficient  weight  to  the
      public interest generally or with regard to  the  public  interest  in
      firm immigration control. I have read  the  determination  with  great
      care and I can find no reference to the public  interest  at  all.  It
      cannot be said that the judge carried out a proper balancing  exercise
      and therefore fell into legal error. I have to remake the decision.


  13. As the decision had to be remade as at the  date  of  hearing  it  was
      necessary to hear up-to-date evidence and  none  was  available  on  1
      September 2014. The matter was adjourned so that statements  could  be
      produced. Unfortunately that did  not  happen  and  at  the  adjourned
      hearing oral evidence was given by the respondent and Jack Allen,  her
      partner.


  14.  The situation as in May 2014 is set out in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      determination and there is no reason to suggest that it is  not  true.
      The respondent has been here since January  2003  and  has  set  up  a
      business known as "Luxe Lash Beauty Salon". She owns a  property  that
      she bought in 2008 and was in a relationship  with  a  United  Kingdom
      national that the judge considered to be genuine and subsisting.  They
      have been living together since November 2013.

  15. At the adjourned hearing the respondent gave evidence. She  said  that
      the statement  prepared for the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  true.  Her
      business, which started in March 2010, is going very well and she  has
      a contract with Nicky Clarke, whom Ms Everett kindly  told  me  was  a
      well known and fashionable hairdresser in Mayfair.  She  entered  into
      this contract on 3  September  2014.   She  is  an  eyelash  extension
      specialist and she sees customers every four weeks. Her tax return for
        2013/14 shows profits of  over  �10,000  and  she  expects  to  have
      profits of over �30,000 for this tax year. I have  seen  documentation
      that supports what she says and I was also given the address  of  both
      her website and that of Nicky Clarke.


  16. She plans to get engaged this year and marry next. The reason for  the
      delay is that she wants Jack to meet  her  parents.   This  could  not
      happen whilst the  appeal  is  outstanding.  They  started  dating  in
      November 2012 and living together in 2013. She owns a  property  worth
      �550,000 with a mortgage of �273,000.


  17. In cross-examination she said that she could not carry out her work in
      Asia; her skill is only relevant to European eyes and not Asian  ones.
      She also paints portraits. Her partner would  support  an  application
      from Korea for her to join him here.


  18. In answer to questions from the Tribunal she said that that she was in
      no doubt that she would obtain a visa on the basis of her  ten  years'
      lawful residence. She thought that she complied with  the  rules.  The
      agency said that everything was all  right  as  the  Home  Office  had
      granted the earlier visa and she thought that all would be well.


  19. Jack Allen gave evidence. He was paid just under �38,000 a year.  They
      want a further mortgage so that they can buy a house to let  and  live
      in one of the properties. Their relationship is very serious.


  20. Ms Everett said that she did not dispute that   the evidence given  by
      the respondent and her partner was truthful and she accepted that  the
      relationship was subsisting.  There was, however, no  reason  why  the
      respondent  could  not  return  to  Korea  and  make  an  application,
      supported by her partner, to return.


  21. I turn to the question of private and family life. In considering  the
      appellant's claim under article  8  I  have  reminded  myself  of  the
      questions set out by Lord Bingham at paragraph 17 of the  opinions  in
      the House of Lords decision in Razgar v SSHD [2004]  UKHL  27.   These
      are:

    (1)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority
        with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to  respect  for  his
        private or (as the case may be) family life.


    (2)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity as
        potentially to engage the operation of article 8?


     2) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


     3) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic  society  in
        the interests of national security, public safety or  the  economic
        well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
        for the protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of
        the rights and freedoms of others?

     4) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate  public
        end sought to be achieved?

  22. Whilst it is clear that the appellant enjoys  family  life  with  Jack
      Allen, I do not believe that an ECHR claim can succeed based  on  that
      relationship. That is because the Immigration Rules  make  proper  and
      adequate provision for family life such as this and there  is  nothing
      about this case that would justify going outside thee rules.


  23.  I turn to private life. The respondent  has  lived  in  this  country
      since January 2003 when she was twenty.  She  was  involved  in  study
      until 2010 and after that she was entitled to work. It  is  not  clear
      precisely when she started to work but it would  appear  that  it  was
      some time in 2010. I conclude that the respondent does  enjoy  private
      life in this country and the answer to questions 1 to 4  is  yes.  The
      question is whether removal would be proportionate.

  24. As I am remaking the decision  I have  to  consider,  in  relation  to
      proportionality,  the new section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002, that reads:

             (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
             the public interest.
              (4) Little weight should be given to-
             (a) a private life, or
             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
             that is established by a person at a time when the person is
             in the   United Kingdom unlawfully.
             (5) Little weight should be given to a private life
             established by a person at a time when the person's
             immigration status is precarious.


  25.    The respondent  has  spent  some  twelve  years  training  for  and
      practicing the work that she now carries out. It is clear that she  is
      very good at her work and is successful. Whilst I do  not  doubt  that
      she will be able to earn a living in Korea it appears that  her skills
      are particularly appropriate to European women and she is likely to be
      more successful  here  than  in  Korea  but  she  is  clearly  a  very
      enterprising person who is likely to be successful  wherever  she  is.
      There are strong personal arguments in favour of the proposition  that
      removal would not be proportionate and they hardly need spelling  out.
      I would add that some matters  that  might  support  that  proposition
      cannot be relied on. The fact that she has always paid her way and her
      taxes and would appear to be a useful and productive member of society
      is not something that she can rely on  in  this  regard.  Many  people
      would be useful members of society but that does not give them a right
      to remain here. Good conduct may be a sine qua non underlying a  right
      to remain but it does not found one.


  26. The arguments in favour of removal being proportionate are to be found
      in section 117B above. It is clear that the respondent  overstayed  on
      one occasion for   four days and on another she made an  out  of  time
      application. Her leave expired on 31 October 2007 and she applied  for
      further leave on 24 July 2008. She was therefore here  unlawfully  for
      nearly nine months. I accept that the respondent was not personally to
      blame for the second of these breaches. She does not dispute the first
      but that is for a very modest amount of time.  When one looks  at  the
      picture as a whole we are dealing with a person who is  attempting  to
      conform with the Immigration Rules and do  things  by  the  book.  The
      respondent's  immigration  history  is  not  perfect  but  it  is  not
      seriously bad and I accept that she  did  not  intend  to  breach  the
      rules.


  27. I turn to the giving of little  weight  to  a  private  life  that  is
      established when the person is in the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully  or
      when  their  immigration  status  is  precarious.  The  private   life
      established here is, in reality, the establishing by the respondent in
      work here, and perhaps also the purchase of a house. That happened  in
      the period between 2010 and the present time and during that time  her
      immigration status was precarious, in that there was no  certainty  or
      even likelihood that she would be allowed to stay permanently.


  28. However, I am satisfied  that  the  respondent,  during  that  period,
      honestly believed that she was likely to be allowed to remain in  this
      country, and her belief was not, in the light  of  the  facts  as  she
      believed then to be, irrational. I reach that conclusion on the  basis
      of her evidence that is set out in paragraph 18, above. I believe that
      an honest and rational belief that one's  immigration  status  is  not
      precarious is a factor that can allow a judge to mitigate the force of
      section 117B in  this  regard.   I  agree  with  Ms  Everett  that  an
      applicant cannot evade responsibility for  errors  of  an  agent,  but
      where that is where the responsibility lies. An applicant can rely  on
      her good faith, if that is accepted, as it is here.


  29.  A proportionality exercise is always difficult as  one  is  balancing
      something that  is  abstract,  namely  the  public  interest,  against
      something that is real and tangible, namely the life and experience of
      an individual, and like is not measured against like. Here I conclude,
      in the light of what I have said above,    that  the  Public  Interest
      that is clearly a  serious  factor,  is  outweighed  by  the  personal
      matters that militate in favour of removal not being proportionate.


  30.  It follows  that  the  original  judge  made  an  error  of  law.   I
      substitute an  identical decision allowing the appeal

The appeal is dismissed
