Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr H Kannangara Counsel, instructed by Law Direct
Immigration
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Mrs Jeewanthi Manik Kodithuwankku Kankanamge,  date  of
    birth 27 October 1979 referred to as the first appellant, and A S Gardi
    Hewawasam Thuduwage date of birth 14th of May 1978, referred to as  the
    second appellant, are citizens of Sri Lanka.

 2. It is not necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 3. These are appeals by the appellants against the determination of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Kelsey promulgated on 4th April  2014.   The  judge
    dismissed the appeals of the appellants against the  decisions  of  the
    respondent dated 28th June 2013. The respondent had refused to vary the
    appellants' leave to remain in the United Kingdom and  had  decided  to
    remove the appellants from the United Kingdom.

 4. The first appellant had applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 1
    (Entrepreneur) under the Point Based System under paragraph 245DD.  The
    second appellant's application is as a dependant spouse  of  the  first
    appellant.

 5. Before me it was conceded by the respondent that there is an  error  of
    law in the original determination,  albeit  through  no  fault  of  the
    judge. The respondent  also  concedes  that  the  decision  is  not  in
    accordance with the law and that accordingly there  is  an  application
    before the respondent that requires a lawful decision.

 6. For points to  be  awarded  for  access  to  funds  under  the  Tier  1
    entrepreneur  route,  the  first   appellant   had   to   produce   the
    documentation in accordance with Appendix A paragraph 41  and  41-  SD.
    Amongst the provision was a provision relating to evidence required  in
    respect of an application where the funds are to be provided  by  third
    parties (41-SD paragraph (b)(ii)).

 7. It was the appellants' case that they met the requirements  for  points
    as they had access to funds of at least ï¿½200,000.  The funds were to be
    provided by third parties, as identified in the refusal  letter  of  28
    June 2013.

 8. The requirements of the rules under  appendix  A  paragraph  41-SD  sub
    paragraph (b) required that there had to  be  a  letter  from  a  legal
    representative  and  that  the  letter  had  to  have  the  information
    specified in 41-SD (b) (ii).

 9. As identified in the refusal letter of 28 June 2013 the letter from the
    legal representative submitted with the application did  not  have  the
    required information and therefore did not meet the requirements of the
    rules. The letter of refusal specifically identifies the defects in the
    letter from the legal representative. It appears to  be  accepted  that
    the letter from the legal representatives did  not  have  the  required
    information.

10. The judge in making his decision applied the provisions as set out.

11. The  respondent's  representative  conceded  that  there  is  a  policy
    applicable to  applications  as  Tier  1  (Entrepreneurs).  The  policy
    reference V.2.0. [valid 20th May 2013 to  1st  October  2013)  provided
    that in respect of Tier 1 Entrepreneurs where required  information  on
    the letters and documents  was  missing,  the  caseworker  "may"  write
    requiring the additional information.

12. It is conceded that  the  caseworker  should  have  written  requesting
    further information and by  reason  thereof  the  decision  is  not  in
    accordance with the law.

13. Through no fault of  the  judge  there  is  an  error  of  law  in  the
    determination. The decision to dismiss these appeals is set aside and I
    substitute the following decision:

         The appeals are allowed to the extent that there  are  applications
         before the respondent which require lawful decisions.

         In the circumstances I make no fee award.






Signed                              Date


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge McClure
