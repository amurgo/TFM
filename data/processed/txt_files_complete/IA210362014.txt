                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant, a citizen of  Nigeria  born  on  22
    December 1987, against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  M  A
    Khan, who sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  15  October  2014  and  in  a
    determination subsequently promulgated on 14  November  2014  dismissed
    the appeal of the Appellant against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 7 May 2014 cancelling his  continuing  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom and refusing him leave to enter the United Kingdom under
    paragraph 2A(8) of the Immigration Act 1971.  Further that in light  of
    the deception employed by the Appellant upon arrival  and  following  a
    further interview, that any future applications for entry clearance  or
    leave to enter the United Kingdom  would  be  refused  under  paragraph
    320(7B) of the Immigration Rules for a period of one year from the date
    on which the Appellant was removed from the  United  Kingdom  following
    that refusal.

2.   The Respondent noted  that  the  Appellant  held  a  current  UK  entry
    clearance endorsed Tier 4 (General) Student  that  conferred  leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom between 17 June 2013 and 30 October 2015.  The
    change of circumstance in this case was that despite claiming to  be  a
    student at London Corporate College and to have last attended in  April
    2014 with this information having been confirmed by the college, it was
    clear at interview, that the Appellant knew nothing of substance  about
    his course of study, specifically  that  he  was  unable  to  tell  the
    interviewing officer what he had learnt from September 2013 to date.

3.   Further, when questioned about whether or not  he  had  worked  in  the
    United Kingdom, the Appellant initially claimed to have only worked for
    a three month period, when he first arrived in October  2010.   He  was
    questioned on any employment he had in the United Kingdom in excess  of
    three times (separately) throughout his further interview.  Checks with
    other government  departments  in  fact  evidenced  that  he  had  been
    employed on a permanent capacity with Chris Carey's  Collections  since
    October 2011. They in turn,  confirmed  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    working on average, a 36 hour week and that he had last worked for them
    on 17 April, earning at least  ï¿½1,000  per  month,  in  breach  of  his
    student terms and conditions.

4.   It is right to say that in granting permission  to  appeal,  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lambert limited such permission to the  contention  that
    although Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR were raised  in  the  Appellant's
    original grounds of appeal

         "... the Judge's human rights analysis at paragraph  29  was  brief
         and contains no reference to the  argument  on  Article  8  medical
         grounds.  On this ground only the appeal is arguable".

5.   It was contended in the grounds of application that the original  Judge
    did not engage with Article 8 at all in the course of his determination
    and that his treatment of Article 3 was "cursory in the  extreme".   It
    was said that the Judge made "the bold  assertion  that  the  Appellant
    would be able to access medical care  for  his  condition  in  Nigeria"
    (when there was) no basis for that assertion".

6.   Thus the appeal came before me on 7 April 2015 when my first  task  was
    to decide whether the determination of the First-tier  Judge  disclosed
    an error on a point of law such as may  have  materially  affected  the
    outcome of the appeal.  The question for me was not whether the  appeal
    against the decision and the  challenge  by  the  Appellant  should  be
    allowed or dismissed, but was  concerned  only  with  the  question  of
    whether the Judge made an error of law of a nature such as  to  require
    his decision to be set aside.   It  would  only  be  if  that  question
    returned a positive answer, that it would be open to the Upper Tribunal
    to disturb the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

7.   It would be as well to note that it follows from the limited  grant  of
    permission, that the Judge's findings in all other respects in terms of
    this appeal were unquestionably  open  to  him  and  supported  by  the
    evidence and were sustainable in law.  The Judge  had  noted  that  the
    Respondent had gathered "a great deal of  evidence  to  show  that  the
    Appellant was working as a full-time employee in breach of his  student
    visa conditions" and that "the Respondent has established the  case  of
    the cancellation of the Appellant's leave to enter...".

8.   In the course of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  he
    recorded that the Appellant did not  give  evidence  before  him.   His
    Counsel had sought to rely on psychiatric reports of a  Dr  Alemi  that
    stated that the Appellant did not understand the  concept  of  pleading
    and that he was a vulnerable adult who  did  not  know  the  nature  of
    wrongdoing and that he did not understand the meaning of guilty of  the
    charges or not guilty of the charges.  Further that the  Appellant  was
    not fit to give evidence and needed medical treatment.

9.   The Judge made specific reference at page 4 of  Dr  Alemi's  report  in
    that regard.

10.  At paragraph 29 of his determination the Judge had this to say:

         "The Appellant  will  be  able  to  access  medical  care  for  his
         condition in Nigeria.  It is a well-established  principle  of  law
         that member states do not have an obligation for medical  treatment
         of non-member states of the European Union.   The  Appellant  is  a
         Nigerian national.  He has family in Nigeria and a  sister  in  the
         UK.  Ifind (sic) that he will have the family support in Nigeria to
         assist him with his treatment for any  mental  condition.   On  the
         evidence, I find that the Appellant has nt  (sic)  established  his
         case on the high threshold of Article 3 of the ECHR."

11.  In that regard I referred the parties to the  decision  in  GS  (India)
    [2015] EWCA Civ  46,  which  concerned  Appellants  who  suffered  from
    serious medical conditions that would be effectively treated in the UK,
    of which five were found to be  at  risk  of  a  very  early  death  if
    returned  to  their  home  states  and  thus  challenged  the   removal
    directions as being repugnant to their rights guaranteed by Articles  3
    and 8 of the ECHR.

12.  It was held inter alia, that the language of Article 3 showed that  the
    paradigm case of a violation was "an intentional act which  constitutes
    torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment", and that  the
    paradigm of Article 8 was much more diffused in that unlike Article  3,
    no single paradigm could be obtained from its language.  There were two
    linked paradigms; one was the capacity to form and enjoy  relationships
    and the other was a right to privacy.

13.  Laws LJ, who gave the leading judgment,  held  that  where  a  claimant
    failed to resist removal to another state on  health  grounds,  failure
    under Article 3 did not necessarily entail  failure  under  Article  8.
    However, if the Article 3  claim  failed,  then  Article  8  could  not
    prosper without  some  separate  or  additional  factual  element  that
    brought the case within the Article 8 paradigm, i.e.  the  capacity  to
    form and enjoy  relationships,  or  a  state  of  affairs  having  some
    affinity with the paradigm.

14.   Whilst  I  appreciate  that  this  important  decision  postdated  the
    determination of the Judge in the present case, the fact  remains  that
    Judges interpret existing legal principles, they reveal the law.   They
    do not do so prospectively.

15.  It was Mr Lee's  submission  that  the  First-tier  Judge  should  have
    proceeded to consider Article 8.  It was important for  justice  to  be
    seen to be done and for the Appellant to understand why he had lost  on
    the points that he had put forward.

16.  Mr Lee submitted that in this case there was a  very  cursory  analysis
    of Article 3 and no analysis at all of Article 8.

17.  Mr Lee accepted that the  guidance  in  GS  made  an  Article  8  claim
    difficult but it did not make it impossible and he submitted  that  the
    Appellant was thus entitled as an absolute minimum, to expect the First-
    tier Judge to consider all the arguments and to put reasons forward why
    he accepted or rejected them.  Mr Lee continued that the  decision  was
    "so bad that it falls into the category of a denial of justice".   This
    was a case where the Appellant could not take part.  It  was  thus  not
    known what evidence the Appellant would have given in this case because
    he was not capable of giving evidence at the time of the  hearing.   Mr
    Lee submitted that the Judge's failure to deal with the appeal  of  the
    Appellant's  case  tainted  the  whole  process  and  could  have  been
    material.

18.  Mr Tufan in response submitted that there was  no  reasoned  Article  8
    claim before the First-tier Judge apart from  the  Appellant's  medical
    condition.  This was an Appellant who had formed no family  or  private
    life.  There was no Article 8 case in any event.

19.  I reserved my decision.

Assessment

20.  I would accept that  the  analysis  by  the  First-tier  Judge  of  the
    Appellant's human rights claim is on first reading skimpy.  However,  I
    have no power to intervene unless something is shown to  be  materially
    wrong.  The determination on the point might be brief for the very good
    reason that there is no merit whatsoever in this case.

21.   Having  listened  to  further  argument  I  am  persuaded   that   the
    determination could certainly have been  longer  and  might  have  been
    better as a result, but that the decision would have been the same.

22.  The fact is that the evidence  did  not  support  a  finding  that  the
    Appellant's ill health was so severe  and  advanced  that  his  removal
    would violate the United Kingdom's obligation under Article 3 and there
    was no separate or factual element that brought  the  case  within  the
    Article 8 provisions.

23.   I  must  say  that  the  presentation  of  First-tier   Judge   Khan's
    determination  is  rather  concerning  as  it  includes  several  basic
    grammatical/spelling errors  that  might  be  generously  described  as
    typographical faults.

24.  I wonder if Judge Khan accordingly signed what was a  draft,  as  I  am
    sure he would be concerned at the poor quality of some of the  writing.
    Nevertheless, as I have  earlier  pointed  out,  I  have  to  look  for
    material errors.

25.  Mr Lee describes the Judge's analysis of  the  Appellant's  claim  with
    reference to Article 3 of the ECHR as cursory but I find that it can be
    better put, that there was a very brisk consideration  of  what  was  a
    cursory claim.  Judge Khan correctly referred  to  the  high  threshold
    applicable to Article 3 medical cases and the medical  evidence  before
    the Tribunal wholly failed in his opinion to make out any case that the
    appeal could be allowed properly on Article 3 ECHR grounds.

26.  Whatever is said of the Appellant's mental health, it is clear  (as  Mr
    Tufan pointed out in his submissions) that he had been well  enough  to
    hold down a job in breach of the Immigration Rules  and  there  was  no
    evidence that treatment was not available for him in Nigeria.

27.  The case clearly could not be allowed on Article 3 grounds and  if  the
    First-tier Judge did not actually say so, I am satisfied that  this  is
    what he meant.  The determination cannot be read sensibly in any  other
    way.

28.  Mr Lee is on firmer ground when he complains that the  appeal  was  not
    considered at all under Article 8 of the ECHR.  It  should  have  been.
    However, I cannot see from the evidence how it could have been allowed.
     The fact is that the Appellant has no strong links in the UK and would
    be returned to a country where medical treatment is available, although
    it is trite law that it might be right to allow an appeal under Article
    8 grounds where it would not be allowed under Article  3  grounds.   If
    such a case actually exists it does not exist on these facts.   Mr  Lee
    could not point me to anything to  enable  me  or  any  other  Tribunal
    directing itself, properly to allow the appeal.

29.  I hope that First-tier Judge Khan will note the comments  on  the  poor
    presentation of his determination  on  the  appeal  on  this  occasion,
    because it would not make a favourable impression on anyone reading it.

30.  However, I see no point in giving the Appellant another opportunity  to
    argue a case which cannot succeed on the available evidence.

Decision

The making of the previous decision involved the making of  no  error  on  a
point of law and I order that it shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
