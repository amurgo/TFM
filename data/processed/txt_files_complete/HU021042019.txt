For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    BACKGROUND

 1. By a decision promulgated on 23 January 2020, I found an error  of  law
    in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge C  Greasley  allowing  the
    Appellant's appeal.  I therefore  set  aside  that  decision  and  gave
    directions for further evidence and a resumed hearing.    My  error  of
    law decision is appended hereto for ease of reference.

 2. The background to the Appellant's case is set out at [9] to [14] of  my
    decision. I do not need to repeat that although I will expand on  parts
    of that case in what follows.

 3. Similarly, I do not need to set out again the law which applies in this
    case.  As I explained at [16] to  [27]  of  my  earlier  decision,  the
    essential question in this case is  whether  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to the Appellant's family life with her husband continuing in
    Turkey.  If there are not,  since  the  Appellant  cannot  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules ("the Rules") based on her family  life  unless  such
    obstacles exist (applying paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM to the Rules  -
    "EX.1"), the Appellant cannot succeed within  the  Rules.   As  I  also
    there explained, if she is unable to succeed within the Rules, that  is
    relevant to whether she can succeed in establishing outside  the  Rules
    that the consequences of her removal are "unjustifiably  harsh".   When
    making an assessment outside the Rules, I must also have regard to  the
    factors set out in Section 117B Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 ("Section 117B").

    THE EVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE

 4. The Appellant had previously filed a bundle for the hearing before  the
    First-tier Tribunal paginated to [507].  A further bundle was  provided
    for the hearing before me (in accordance with  the  direction  which  I
    gave in my earlier decision).  However, the bundle as  filed  with  the
    Tribunal was deficient as it was incomplete, and Mr Kotas did not  have
    a copy at all.  He agreed however that it was appropriate  to  proceed.
    I gave a direction that the Appellant's solicitor file a  complete  and
    properly paginated bundle  following  the  hearing  which  was  finally
    received in hard copy on 17 March 2020.  I  refer  to  the  documentary
    evidence in what follows as [AB/xx].

 5. Although I heard oral evidence from the  Appellant,  her  husband,  [Mr
    AE], and her mother-in-law, [Mrs ZE], I do not need to say  much  about
    this evidence.   Although  the  witnesses  confirmed  that  they  could
    understand the interpreter provided by the Tribunal for the hearing, in
    the course of Mr [E]'s testimony,  an  issue  arose  as  to  whether  a
    question  and  answer  given  by  the  Appellant  had   been   properly
    interpreted.  The court interpreter thought that a  question  had  been
    asked by Mr Kotas  during  the  Appellant's  testimony  which  was  not
    consistent with either my or Mr Kotas' note  of  the  question.   As  a
    result, the court interpreter considered that the discrepancy which  Mr
    Kotas put to Mr [E] was not an inconsistency in the way  in  which  the
    prior question and answer had been translated by him.

 6. It is not clear whether this was an error in the understanding  of  the
    interpreter  or  an  error  in  his  interpretation.   The  interpreter
    confirmed that if there was a discrepancy  in  the  answers  given,  it
    might be due to an error  of  interpretation  on  his  part.   He  also
    indicated however that he was having some  difficulty  in  providing  a
    full interpretation of the Appellant's answers as she  was  giving  her
    answers at some length and quite fast.  Although she was asked to  slow
    down and take  appropriate  pauses  to  allow  for  interpretation,  it
    appeared that there were still some difficulties.

 7. Furthermore, having adjourned  over  lunch  prior  to  submissions,  Ms
    McCarthy returned with a request for an adjournment based on  what  she
    said were further errors in the interpretation of  the  evidence.   Her
    submission in this regard was based on what she had been  told  by  the
    Appellant's  brother-in-law  who  had  sat  in  court  throughout   the
    Appellant's evidence.  I did not hear evidence from this gentleman  who
    it appears works as a cab driver and is not  a  qualified  interpreter.
    It is not clear what is the level of his own English and therefore  his
    ability to ascertain any errors in interpretation,  particularly  since
    he was sat at the back of quite a large court  room  at  some  distance
    from the witness and interpreter.

 8. Nonetheless, based on the  Tribunal's  decision  in  TS  (interpreters)
    Eritrea [2019] UKUT 00352 (IAC), Ms McCarthy submitted  that  I  should
    adjourn to a later resumed hearing  with  a  different  interpreter  in
    fairness to the Appellant. She confirmed that she did  not  intend  any
    personal criticism of the interpreter.

 9. Mr Kotas objected to the adjournment request.  He drew my attention  to
    [5] of the headnote in TS which reads as follows:

         "A challenge by a representative to the competence of  a  Tribunal-
         appointed interpreter must not be made lightly.  If made, it  is  a
         matter for the judge to  address,  as  an  aspect  of  the  judge's
         overall duty to ensure a fair hearing.  Amongst the matters  to  be
         considered will be whether the challenge appears to be motivated by
         a desire to have the hearing aborted, rather than  by  any  genuine
         material concern over the standard of interpretation."

10. As Mr Kotas  pointed  out,  there  was  no  formal  evidence  from  the
    Appellant's brother-in-law as to the interpretation errors which he  is
    said to  have  identified.    I  had  no  evidence  to  show  that  the
    Appellant's brother-in-law  had  a  sufficient  grasp  of  English  and
    Turkish to provide the necessary evidence, were he to be  asked  to  do
    so.  Nonetheless, as Ms McCarthy pointed out, there was a concern about
    at least one of the answers given by the Appellant and whether that was
    discrepant with  the  answer  given  by  her  husband  or  whether  any
    inconsistency might be due to interpretation problems.

11. In the course of  Mr  Kotas'  submissions  regarding  the  adjournment,
    however, it became clear that it would  be  possible  to  complete  the
    hearing without any unfairness  to  the  Appellant  if  the  Respondent
    agreed not to rely on any inconsistencies in the oral evidence given by
    the Appellant and her witnesses.  Mr Kotas submitted that, even  if  he
    were to exclude such reliance,  the  Appellant  could  not  succeed  in
    showing either that there were insurmountable obstacles to family  life
    continuing in Turkey or that it would be unjustifiably harsh to  return
    her to that country.   I therefore refused the adjournment on the basis
    that the Respondent would proceed in this way and submissions were made
    on that premise.

12. Before turning to consider the cases of the respective parties,  it  is
    therefore appropriate for me to set out what the evidence  shows  about
    the factors relied upon by the Appellant as reasons why she  cannot  be
    returned to Turkey.

    Evidence of the Appellant

13. The Appellant has provided two witness statements dated  22  July  2019
    (unpaginated) and one dated 14 February 2020 ([AB/508-512]).

14. In her first statement, the Appellant relies on the following matters:

       . Her relationship with her husband and his family who  live  in  the
         UK.  His parents and two brothers live here as do his cousins.  She
         also has cousins living  here.   She  also  says  at  [9]  of  that
         statement  that  she  "also  [has]  good  relationship  with  [her]
         relatives".  In light of later evidence, I understand her  to  mean
         that the relationship with  such  family  as  she  has  in  the  UK
         including her husband's family is good rather than that she  has  a
         good relationship with her family remaining in Turkey (which  would
         be contrary to her other evidence).

       . Fertility treatment which she and her husband are undergoing in the
         UK.  According to their evidence, this treatment is being privately
         funded.

       . Her psychological health.  In her first statement,  she  attributes
         her problems to her inability to have a child.  She says  that  she
         is "originally coming from rural area of Turkey" and  that  when  a
         woman is unable to have a child "the family will  put  pressure  on
         husband to marry to a new wife".  She says that her  husband  would
         not divorce her, but she is concerned that his "close family" would
         put pressure on him to do so.

       . Her relationship with her own family who  remain  in  Turkey.   She
         says that she does "not have connection with [her] family in Turkey
         and it is unlikely they will accept [her] to the family".  She says
         that she was "subject to domestic violence from [her] elder brother
         and due to this [she] would not be able to return to [her] family".

15. The Appellant's second statement largely repeats what is  said  in  her
    first statement.  She provides the following additional evidence:

       . Her husband came to the UK with his family aged sixteen  years  and
         obtained settlement as the family member  of  a  refugee.   He  has
         however returned to Turkey for "short periods on holiday".  He  has
         only "distant relatives" in Turkey with whom  he  has  no  contact.
         She says that her husband could not return to Turkey with  her  "as
         he will have problems fitting in and finding a job".

       . Fertility treatment is ongoing.  She had an  appointment  with  her
         husband on 11 February 2020 to discuss further treatment.  She does
         not wish to change hospitals and consultants as all  their  records
         are there and they have confidence in the hospital -  Guys  and  St
         Thomas - "which [they] know is one of the  best  Hospitals  in  the
         world".

       . The medical condition of the Appellant's brother-in-law ([F] who is
         not the brother who attended the hearing).  The Appellant's husband
         provides his mother with "a lot of help"  in  this  regard  as  his
         mother is [F]'s full-time carer.  The Appellant's husband  provides
         his mother with respite at weekends when not working and helps with
         personal care as [F] is an adult and therefore his mother has  some
         difficulty with his personal care.

       . The Appellant  has  three  brothers  all  living  in  Turkey.   Her
         brothers did not want her to marry her husband. One of her brothers
         beat her and she had to leave home to live  with  her  aunt  before
         coming to join her husband in the UK.   She says that  her  husband
         also fears her brother and that she fears that her brother will use
         her infertility "as an excuse to use violence on [her] and continue
         to bully [her]".

16. In her oral evidence, the Appellant confirmed the following matters:

       . She and  her  husband  attended  the  hospital  appointment  on  11
         February  2020  and  were  given  options  for  further  treatment.
         Although I indicated in  the  course  of  that  evidence  that  the
         Appellant could provide evidence about that further treatment after
         the hearing, I do not have any update in that regard but  I  accept
         her evidence that  they  intend  to  continue  with  treatment  (at
         private expense).  She said that it would take  two  years  to  get
         back to the position they are in now if returned  to  Turkey.   She
         said that conceiving will be more  difficult  as  she  gets  older.
         When asked whether she could obtain a copy of her records  to  take
         back with her to Turkey, she said that she could not go back.   She
         did not offer any evidence that the records could not  be  obtained
         and taken back to Turkey or be transferred there.

       . In relation to her ill-treatment by  her  brothers,  the  Appellant
         said that one of her brothers who lived  at  home  had  beaten  her
         several times.  She  has  problems  with  her  hip  caused  by  the
         beatings.  Her brother did not like her working.  He did  not  want
         her to marry her husband.  She  said  that  her  brother  had  also
         assaulted her husband several times.  She feared that  her  brother
         would find her wherever she went in Turkey.   Her parents  did  not
         stop her brother beating her because  in  their  culture,  she  was
         expected to do as her elder brother told her.

       . As a result of the ill-treatment, the Appellant confirmed that  she
         had moved to live with her aunt following  her  engagement  to  her
         husband  in  2011.   She  had  remained  there  until  2013.    The
         Appellant's family lived in Gaziantep province.  Her aunt lived  in
         the same province but had since moved to Cyprus.   The  Appellant's
         brother had tried to contact her at her aunt's house  but  was  not
         let in.  He had  tried  to  assault  her  but  was  not  given  the
         opportunity.

       . The Appellant said that her husband had visited the family home  on
         one occasion to ask permission  to  marry  her.   Her  brother  was
         opposed to the marriage as was her father  initially,  but  he  had
         relented when the  Appellant  said  that  she  loved  her  husband.
         Following their engagement in 2011,  the  Appellant's  husband  had
         come to visit her once in Gaziantep, but her brother said  that  he
         could not come and so they met elsewhere (in Elbistan) about  three
         hours from the Appellant's hometown.

       . The Appellant married  her  husband  in  Gaziantep  province  in  a
         registry office.  They celebrated their marriage when they returned
         to the UK.

       . The Appellant indicated  that  she  was  presently  only  receiving
         medication in connection with her IVF.  She had been  taking  other
         medication for  depression  but  had  discontinued  that  when  she
         started IVF treatment.  She had  received  psychological  treatment
         from Ozden Bayraktar.  His report appears at [AB/519-521].  I  deal
         with that later in this decision.  She had also seen Tarkan Mustafa
         who had prepared a report dated 23 July  2019  (separate  from  the
         bundles).  She has not consulted any other doctors.

    Mr [AE]

17. The Appellant's husband has provided two witness statements, the  first
    dated 22 July 2019 (unpaginated) and the second dated 13 February  2020
    ([AB/513-516]). He also gave oral evidence.

18. In his first statement, Mr [E] confirmed that he has been living in the
    UK for seventeen years.  He is now aged  thirty-four  years.   He,  his
    parents and his two brothers are all  now  British  citizens.   In  his
    second statement, he says that the family came to join  his  father  by
    way of family reunion in June 2002.  It appears from his statement that
    his father came to the UK to avoid oppression  as  an  Alevi  Kurd.   I
    assume from what is  there  said  that  his  father  was  a  recognised
    refugee.   In  his  second  statement,  Mr  [E]  says  that  he   fears
    discrimination in Turkey due to his ethnic  group.   He  says  that  he
    would find it difficult to obtain employment.   However,  there  is  no
    background evidence produced in that regard.

19. Mr [E] confirms that he married the Appellant on 15 June 2012.   He  is
    employed in the UK and is privately funding their fertility  treatment.
     He also confirms that his wife suffers from depression.  He says  that
    he no longer has any connection with Turkey and is  not  able  to  live
    there.

20. In his second statement, Mr [E] provides  more  information  about  his
    employment.  He works as an advertising and distribution assistant  for
    Emirtax  Ltd.   As  I  understood  his  evidence,  his  work   involves
    distribution of leaflets.  He commenced this employment in August 2018.
     Before that, he worked as a chef.  He currently  earns  �19,200  gross
    per annum.

21. Mr [E] confirms his wife's evidence that, because they emanate  from  a
    rural area of Turkey, "[his] relatives are encouraging [him] to divorce
    [the Appellant] because she cannot conceive and to  marry  someone  who
    will be able to have children".   He  does  not  say  if  that  is  his
    relatives in the UK or in Turkey.  However, as he says at [12]  of  his
    statement, he has no contact with his distant relatives in  Turkey.  In
    any event, he says that he has no intention of divorcing the  Appellant
    even though "there would be a lot more pressure on both [him] and  [the
    Appellant] if [they] were to live in Turkey as this would be seen as  a
    genuine reason to divorce".

22. In relation to his brother, [F], Mr [E]  confirms  that  he  gives  his
    mother assistance with his brother's care.  He says that his mother had
    an operation on her right arm  due  to  torn  tendons  and  she  cannot
    therefore lift anything heavy.  He provides no detail of the  level  of
    care which [F] requires but his  evidence  implies  that  [F]  requires
    constant care to meet his personal and essential needs.

23. Mr [E] confirmed  in  his  oral  evidence  that  he  only  visited  the
    Appellant once or twice in Turkey whilst they were engaged because  her
    family disapproved of the relationship.  He also  confirmed  that  they
    had celebrated the marriage in the UK.

24. Mr [E] also  confirmed  that  he  was  paying  privately  for  the  IVF
    treatment.  The total cost was as yet unknown but was expected to reach
    �7,000.  He said he could afford this from his salary.

25. When asked why he could not return to Turkey, Mr [E] said that  he  was
    used to this country and  the  system  here.   He  had  been  here  for
    seventeen or eighteen years and he did not know the system  in  Turkey.
    There was a problem with diversity, and it would be difficult  for  him
    to find a job there.  He confirmed that in addition to his current  job
    distributing leaflets, he had previously worked in the UK  as  a  chef.
    He also said that he could not relocate to Turkey  because  he  has  no
    family there to live amongst.

    Mrs [ZE]

26. Mrs [E] is the Appellant's mother-in-law.  She has provided  a  witness
    statement dated 14 February 2020  ([AB/517-518]).   She  also  provided
    oral evidence.

27. In her statement, Mrs [E] says that she lives with her husband and  two
    of her sons, [F] and [E].  She confirmed in her oral evidence that  [E]
    is the son who was present at the  hearing  and  that  he  works  as  a
    minicab driver.  [F] is aged twenty-one years and, she says, requires a
    lot of care due to his disability.  She says that the Appellant and the
    Appellant's husband provide  a  lot  of  help  with  [F]'s  care.   She
    confirms that due to an operation on her right arm, she  is  unable  to
    lift anything heavy.  She also says that [F]  is  "very  fond"  of  the
    Appellant who he sees as a sister.  She says that [F] has difficulty in
    communicating with people but that, over time, the Appellant has gained
    his trust.

28. Mrs [E] also confirms that her husband came here as a refugee  and  the
    rest of the family joined him by way of family reunion.   She says that
    her son, the Appellant's husband, would find it difficult to return  to
    Turkey due to  the  ongoing  discrimination  against  Alevi  Kurds  and
    because he would not have the support of his family there.    She  said
    however that she still returned to Turkey and was there last  year  (in
    Bodrum).  She said that the Appellant's husband was last in Turkey when
    they got married.  Although she confirmed that she still has family  in
    Turkey, she said that these were only distant relatives.

29. In her oral evidence, Mrs [E] confirmed that  all  of  the  Appellant's
    husband's family approve of his relationship with the  Appellant.   She
    said that it is only the Appellant's family which disapproves  of  this
    relationship.  She said this was because the Appellant's brother wanted
    her to marry someone else.   She also confirmed that the  Appellant  is
    no longer in contact with her family in Turkey. I am prepared to accept
    that this is the position although I note that there is mention in  the
    Appellant's application for  leave  to  remain  at  [AB/447]  that  she
    returned to  Turkey  between  25  July  2015  to  28  August  2015  for
    "brother's wedding".  Since both of her husband's brothers live in  the
    UK, I assume that this must be  her  brother  although  of  course  not
    necessarily the brother with whom she lived prior to coming to  the  UK
    and who she says ill-treated her.

    Other Documentary Evidence

    Medical Evidence: Appellant's Mental Health Problems

30. In relation to the Appellant's  mental  health  problems,  I  have  the
    following documents:

       . Report of Tarkan Mustafa,  MA  dated  23  July  2019  (unpaginated,
         separate from bundle)

       . Report of Ozden Bayraktar, MSc, Phd Candidate ([AB/519-521])

31. Neither report contains a CV setting out the relevant experience of the
    writers of the reports.  Neither contains a paragraph recognising their
    duties to the Tribunal as independent experts.  It is not clear from Mr
    Mustafa's report what  degree  of  interaction  he  has  had  with  the
    Appellant nor over what  timescale.  That  is  relevant  in  particular
    because the report wrongly records certain aspects of  the  Appellant's
    history as I refer to below.  Although Mr Bayraktar mentions "a  number
    of sessions" with the Appellant, he does not record  how  many  nor  of
    what length.  He says that those  sessions  occurred  only  in  January
    2020.

32. Dealing first with Mr Mustafa's report, the  only  evidence  about  his
    qualifications comes from the heading to his report.  His  only  formal
    qualification appears to be a MA.  The subject of that  degree  is  not
    stated.   The  heading  then  includes  the  words  "Psychotherapy  and
    Analysis" which does not indicate that he is  himself  qualified  as  a
    psychotherapist or analyst.  His only stated professional qualification
    is as an "Associate Member of the School of Natural Health Sciences".

33. Mr Mustafa says that the Appellant "is suffering  from  panic  attacks,
    anxiety, depression, insomnia and severe aches and pains throughout her
    body as a result of her high levels of stress".   He records  that  she
    has suffered panic attacks for a year, insomnia for the past two  years
    and depression for the past three years.  It is  not  clear  that  this
    relies on anything other than the  Appellant's  own  reporting  of  her
    problems.  There is no mention of him having seen her medical  records.
    Those are not in evidence before me.  He does not say that he has  been
    treating her for those conditions.

34. Mr Mustafa attributes the deterioration to "depressing  events  in  her
    life".  The events are  said  to  have  started  with  the  Appellant's
    inability to conceive.   Mr Mustafa  also  says  that  the  Appellant's
    problems included the refusal of leave to remain with  her  husband  on
    three occasions.  He says that she would suffer at  the  hands  of  her
    family on return to Turkey.  I accept that this is consistent with  the
    Appellant's evidence.

35. However, Mr Mustafa (wrongly) records that the  Appellant  has  claimed
    asylum twice and been refused twice.  The Appellant  confirmed  in  her
    evidence that this is not the case.  He also says  that  the  Appellant
    has been  caring  for  her  mother-in-law  for  the  past  three  years
    following an accident.  Although I accept  that  the  evidence  of  the
    Appellant's husband and mother-in-law is that her mother-in-law had  an
    operation as a result of which she is unable to lift heavy weights  and
    therefore requires assistance with [F]'s care, that is not the same  as
    the Appellant's mother-in-law herself requiring care.

36. In any event, it is unclear that Mr Mustafa recognises the function  of
    an expert (insofar as Mr Mustafa has relevant expertise in diagnosis of
    mental illnesses).  Most of his report is merely a record  of  what  he
    has  been  told  by  the  Appellant  (which  record   itself   contains
    inaccuracies).   The  only  medical  opinion  is   contained   in   the
    penultimate sentence where he states that he "also believe[s]  that  if
    [SE] is sent back to Turkey this would be very detrimental to her well-
    being and her sanity".  He offers no evidential underpinning  for  that
    opinion which appears to be based solely on what he has  been  told  by
    the Appellant herself about her mental health history and the causes to
    which that history might be attributed.

37. I can give no weight to Mr Mustafa's report.  It is unclear that he has
    relevant qualifications or experience.  He does not recognise his  duty
    of independence as an expert (if that is what he purports to  be).   It
    is not clear whether and for how long he met with the Appellant.  There
    is no indication that he has been treating her over the time  that  she
    has been experiencing problems. There is no  reference  to  him  having
    seen or consulted the Appellant's medical notes.  Even  if  Mr  Mustafa
    has been treating the Appellant over time, there is no record  of  what
    he observed during any consultations he had with her.   He  has  simply
    accepted the history he has been given and at times  has  misunderstood
    that history.  In any event, he offers no reasons for the one  sentence
    opinion he gives.

38. Turning then to Mr Bayraktar's report, he is said to be a "Psychologist
    and Counselor (sic)".  He works privately.  There is no indication that
    he is a member of any professional association.  He does  not  say  for
    how many years he has practised in the field nor what is  his  relevant
    experience.

39. Once again, a large part of Mr Bayraktar's  report  is  made  up  of  a
    recitation of the Appellant's history as given to him.  That history is
    largely consistent with the Appellant's evidence although her  evidence
    makes no mention of an overdose taken in 2018.  Mr Bayraktar, in common
    with Mr Mustafa, records that the Appellant has panic  attacks,  severe
    migraines and is very depressed.  He says that the  Appellant  "reports
    that she might harm or kill herself if she had to leave the UK".  There
    is no mention of that in any of  her  statements  before  me.  He  also
    reports, consistently with  the  Appellant's  evidence,  that  she  has
    problems with one of her legs which arises from one of the assaults  on
    her by her brother.  The only medical  evidence  in  the  bundle  which
    relates to physical problems consists of two letters dated 10  November
    2016  and  28  December  2016  relating   to   two   appointments   for
    physiotherapy as an  outpatient  in  December  2016  and  January  2017
    ([AB/288-289]) but those appear to be linked  to  a  problem  with  the
    Appellant's shoulder.

40. There appears to be some confusion about the  Appellant's  position  on
    return to Turkey.  Mr Bayraktar appears to assume  that  the  Appellant
    would be forced to return to her home alone and would not be able to do
    so as her family do not accept her due to her marriage.   He  does  not
    consider what the situation would be if her husband returned with  her.
    Mr Bayraktar also expresses the opinion that if the Appellant's husband
    were to go to visit her in Turkey this would affect  their  ability  to
    save for IVF.  He says that it would also be difficult for her  mother-
    in-law if  the  Appellant  were  removed  as  "she  is  old  and  needs
    affection". The Appellant's  mother-in-law  is  aged  fifty-two  years.
    Overall, the passage contained in the last two paragraphs  at  [AB/520]
    and first two paragraphs at [AB/521] appears as submissions  advocating
    for the Appellant's case  and  does  not  disclose  that  Mr  Bayraktar
    recognises his duty of independence to this Tribunal.  That affects the
    weight I can give to his opinions.

41. The only section which contains opinion on  the  matters  on  which  Mr
    Bayraktar may have relevant expertise in any event reads as follows:

         "As a psychologist, I  strongly  believe  that  if  [SE]  would  be
         deported to Turkey, it would be a very destructive and a disastrous
         event for her mental and psychological well  being.   She  has  the
         risk of committing suicide and she  is  already  in  a  very  major
         depression episode.  She would be a  victim  of  her  society,  her
         surrounding and her own family by not being able  to  live  freely,
         safely and confidently.  She is already terrified from her  brother
         who had abused her physically and caused her leg to be operated on.

         Thus, I strongly advise [SE] not to be deported back to  Turkey  as
         it would be a disastrous for her life..."

42. As I have already noted, Mr Bayraktar has misunderstood the position in
    relation to the Appellant's return to Turkey and whether it  is  likely
    that she would return alone.  Even if she would, it  is  not  clear  on
    what Mr Bayraktar bases his analysis of  the  situation  for  a  single
    woman in Turkey.  It is not evident that he has any specific  knowledge
    of circumstances generally in Turkey.   In  any  event,  none  of  that
    analysis is for him.  As a person offering expertise in mental  health,
    I would expect to see some reference to  the  Appellant's  presentation
    and a consideration whether the symptoms she  exhibits  are  consistent
    with a diagnosis and if so the nature of that diagnosis.  There  is  no
    reference to her medical  notes  which  is  relevant  to  the  asserted
    overdose in 2018.   That  is  not  mentioned  in  any  of  the  witness
    evidence.

43. Overall, this report discloses  a  lack  of  independence,  a  lack  of
    relevant reasoned evidence as to the Appellant's mental health problems
    or any formal medical diagnosis or prognosis.   For  those  reasons,  I
    give this report no weight.

44. Whilst I am prepared to accept that the  Appellant  may  have  suffered
    some mental health problems which may have been caused  or  exacerbated
    by her infertility and IVF as  well  as  her  immigration  problems,  I
    cannot accept that she has been  formally  diagnosed  with  any  mental
    health condition.  She herself said that she was no longer  taking  any
    medication for depression because of concerns as to the impact  on  the
    IVF treatment.  As below, she began that treatment some years  ago  and
    therefore, on her  own  case,  she  has  not  received  medication  for
    depression for several years. The only doctors who the  Appellant  said
    she had consulted for her mental health problems were Mr Mustafa and Mr
    Bayraktar.  Mr Bayraktar mentions sessions with  her  only  in  January
    2020.  Mr Mustafa's report does not disclose when or how often  he  has
    met with the Appellant. Neither report  provides  me  with  any  formal
    history of her mental health problems or treatment.  Her medical  notes
    are not in evidence.

    Medical Evidence: IVF

45. The evidence confirms that the Appellant's  last  appointment  for  IVF
    treatment was on 11  February  2020  ([AB/618]).   I  accept  that  the
    treatment is  ongoing  although  the  evidence  which  was  offered  in
    relation to next steps has not materialised.  It appears that treatment
    began, at least with the current provider, in December 2015 ([AB/30]).

46. Due to the lack of updated evidence, there is an absence of any  report
    about the next steps in the couple's treatment plan.  The  most  recent
    evidence  prior  to  the  February  2020  appointment   is   dated   in
    August/September 2018 informing the couple that the NHS Trust  has  one
    embryo frozen for future use ([AB/327]) and that a previous  course  of
    treatment had unfortunately failed ([AB/329]).

47. There is evidence  that  payments  have  been  made  for  some  of  the
    treatment ([AB/619]) and I therefore also accept that  the  couple  are
    privately paying. It appears from the price list at [AB/620]  that  the
    recent amount paid (�300) is for an initial consultation which suggests
    that the couple are at the beginning of the current round of treatment.
     It is not entirely clear how the couple intend to pay the  large  sums
    needed for further treatment; the bank statements  in  the  Appellant's
    bundle do not disclose surplus funds.  However, I  do  not  take  issue
    with the Appellant's husband's evidence that they are privately  paying
    for the treatment (there is for example a debit to Guys Hospital on  11
    December 2018 of �1400 which appears to be for  this  treatment  -  the
    price equates with the cost shown on the  price  list  for  some  items
    included a round of treatment).

48. I cannot however accept that the entire cost has been privately  funded
    to date. The letter from Guy's and  St  Thomas'  NHS  Foundation  Trust
    dated 24 March 2017 ([AB/291]) clearly states that some  treatment  was
    to be funded through Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group,  although  I
    accept that there are receipts in the bundle indicating that  at  least
    some contribution has been  made  by  the  Appellant  and  her  husband
    ([AB/317]).

    Medical Evidence in relation to [F]

49. The medical evidence in relation to [F]  appears  at  [AB/598-599]  and
    [AB/605-616].  He is also under the care of Guy's and  St  Thomas'  NHS
    Foundation Trust.  The first letter is dated 13 April 2018.  [F] was at
    that time aged just under twenty years.  The letter is mainly concerned
    with [F]'s "severe obstructive sleep apnoea" which it had been  thought
    was improving but was again  causing  problems.   Although  the  report
    concludes with a promise of further progress reports  in  that  regard,
    none are in evidence.

50. The report refers to a number of other  conditions,  the  main  one  of
    which appears to be Bardet-Bledl syndrome which is not explained in the
    report.  [F] has visual impairment, and moderate learning difficulties.
     It is confirmed in the second letter dated 9 October 2019 that  he  is
    registered blind.  He is said to have been previously obese but now  of
    a normal BMI.  He has also undergone previous  spinal  surgery  and  an
    adenoidectomy.  The first letter also refers to  "Reduced  factor  Xiii
    levels"  and  "Insulin-resistance"  but  those  conditions   are   also
    unexplained.

51. The second letter indicates positive progress.  It is said  that  [F]'s
    weight is "healthily adjusted for his height" and that "he is living an
    active lifestyle".  He is said to swim every week, uses the gym at  the
    college which I  assume  he  is  therefore  attending  and  walks.   In
    relation to his sleeping difficulties, the second letter  reports  that
    "[h]e is now on nocturnal APAP and is tolerating  this  well  reporting
    better energy levels".  He is said to be under regular review with  the
    haematology team for his Factor X1 deficiency and with the spinal  team
    following corrective surgery to deal with scoliosis "a few years  ago".
    The second letter notes routine tests being undertaken at that time and
    a review after eighteen months.

52. There is evidence that the Appellant's mother-in-law  receives  carer's
    allowance of �64.60 per week (in March  2018)  ([AB/601])  which  I  am
    prepared to accept is for the care of [F]  but  there  is  no  evidence
    about the level of care which [F]  requires.    The  reports  from  the
    hospital do not indicate that [F] is physically disabled to the  extent
    of needing lifting or helping with his essential needs; in fact,  quite
    the opposite - the second letter reports an active lifestyle.  Nor does
    the evidence explain why the Appellant's father-in-law and  brother-in-
    law (who lives with his parents) cannot assist to the extent necessary.



    Financial Information

53. A letter from Mr [E]'s current employer at [AB/595-596]  confirms  that
    he has worked for that organisation (Emirprint Ltd) since 6 August 2018
    as a permanent Advertising and Distribution Assistant  earning  �19,200
    gross per annum.  That is confirmed as continuing by payslips at [AB/69-
    72 and AB/557-596].

54. Prior to that date, Mr [E] was working as a chef.  Unfortunately, there
    is neither a witness statement dealing with previous earnings  nor  any
    schedule setting out what the documents show.  Doing  the  best  I  can
    based on the documents, those appear to show the  following  about  the
    Appellant's previous employment and earnings:

       . Working for Eastern Delight (P60 at [AB/150] - earnings  of  �15660
         in tax year to  5  April  2014  which  covers  the  date  when  the
         Appellant entered the UK).

       . Working for Capital Kebab Ltd from March 2015 to  1  February  2016
         earning �676 gross per month (P60 at [AB/125] - �676 in tax year to
         5 April 2015; P45 at [AB/129-130] - �6843.20 earnt to date  in  tax
         year to 5 April 2016; payslips from March 2015 to January  2016  at
         [AB/139).

       . Working for Eren Kebab Ltd t/a Eastern Delight from 1 April 2016 to
         June 2016 earning �936 gross  per  month  (letter  at  [AB/123-4]);
         payslips for April to June 2016 at [AB/135-138].

       . Working for Utkueren Ltd from July 2016 to March 2017 and  for  May
         and June 2017 earning �1247.98 gross per month  for  July  2016  to
         January 2017 and �975 gross per month for May and June 2017 (P45 at
         [AB/127-128 and 156] - �11543.86 earnt to that  date  in  tax  year
         ending 5 April 2017; payslips for July 2016  to  January  2017  and
         May/June 2017 at  [AB/162-171]).   This  is  the  period  when  the
         Appellant made her first application for an extension of  leave  to
         remain.

       . Working for Son Chare Ltd from February to 30  April  2017  earning
         �780 gross per month (P60 at [AB/126] - �1497.60 in tax year  to  5
         April 2017, �11,543.86 in previous  employment  for  that  year  as
         above; P45 at [AB/132-33] - �780 up to 30 April 2017  in  that  tax
         year; pay slips from February to April 2017 at [AB/151-155]).

       . Working for Korkmaz Catering Ltd from 1 July 2017  to  28  February
         2018 earning �975 gross per month and �1200 per month from December
         2017  - �14,400 per annum (pay slips from July to November 2017  at
         [AB/157-161] and from December 2017 at [AB/182];  P45  at  [AB/177-
         179] - �11,205 earnt to that date in tax year ending 5 April  2018;
         letters at [AB/180-181 and 185]).  This  is  the  period  when  the
         Appellant made her second application for an extension of leave  to
         remain.

       . Working for Dalkilic Ltd (P60 at [AB/176] - �1620 in tax year to  5
         April 2018.

       . Working for Denhaz Ltd from April to July 2018 earning �1585  gross
         per month (payslips for April to July 2018 at [AB/172-175].

55. The Appellant has also worked in the UK although confirmed in her  oral
    evidence that she is no longer doing so as she is not permitted to work
    as an overstayer.  The documents at [AB/183-4 and  196-200]  show  that
    she was earning �780 gross per month as at 16  January  2018  when  she
    made her second application.  She had been working from June 2017  part
    time with London Bar Staff Ltd.  Before  then  she  was  working  as  a
    cleaner/ kitchen porter at Ocean Blue Fishbar part time  from  1  April
    2016 on a gross monthly salary  of  �464.53  per  month  (�5574.36  per
    annum) ([AB/186-195]).

    Evidence as to Appellant's English Language Skills

56. The Appellant's certificates and other documents in this regard  appear
    at [AB/39-40 and 43-47].  She has achieved an Entry Level  1  award  in
    ESOL skills for life in 2015 and an Entry Level 2 award in  2016.   The
    documents also show enrolment for Entry Level 3 in  September  2017  to
    December 2017 but no certificate in that regard.  In addition, a letter
    dated 12 August 2009 at [AB/41] confirms that Mr [E] has achieved  ESOL
    Skills for Life at Entry Level 1 in order to naturalise  as  a  British
    citizen.

57.  Although  I  have  no  reason  to  doubt  the   genuineness   of   the
    qualifications, other evidence casts  some  doubt  on  the  Appellant's
    ability to speak English.

58. I do not take into account in this regard that the Appellant  gave  her
    oral  evidence  at  the  hearing  in  Turkish.    In   the   unfamiliar
    surroundings of a court room, it is to be expected  that  an  appellant
    will wish to give evidence in her mother  tongue.   However,  both  her
    written witness statements  including  that  made  as  recently  as  14
    February 2020 had to be translated into Turkish for her.

59. Furthermore, some of the documents associated  with  the  couple's  IVF
    treatment indicate that neither  the  Appellant  nor  her  husband  are
    sufficiently proficient in English to communicate with doctors  without
    an interpreter  (see  [AB/304,  306,  312  and  315]).  Some  of  those
    documents are not recent and  the  lack  of  language  ability  may  be
    explained on that basis.  However, the letter at [AB/315] is  dated  as
    recently as July 2018 (after all of the Appellant's qualifications were
    obtained).  It appears on that occasion that the Appellant  asked  that
    messages be translated for her which the hospital  was  unable  to  do.
    She therefore asked that messages be left with her  brother  (I  assume
    her brother-in-law) or her partner.  It appears however that there were
    also difficulties with the hospital delivering messages in that way.  I
    accept however that the communications in this regard relate to medical
    treatment and may therefore involve the use of technical language.  For
    that reason, I am prepared to assume for the purposes  of  this  appeal
    that the Appellant speaks some English and probably sufficient  to  get
    by in normal day-to-day life.

    Evidence as to Appellant's Immigration History

60. The Appellant entered the UK on  November  2013  with  the  appropriate
    entry clearance as a spouse following her marriage in Turkey on 12 June
    2012.  She had leave to remain until 31 July 2016 (a period  of  thirty
    months).

61. As appears from the Respondent's refusal decision dated 4 December 2017
    (at [AB/372-379]), the Appellant applied for further leave to remain by
    application received on 18 July 2016.  That application is not  in  the
    Appellant's bundle.  For that reason, it is unclear  from  that  letter
    why the Appellant applied for leave  to  remain  on  a  ten-year  route
    rather than the five-year route which would apply if she were  able  to
    meet all the Rules.

62. However, the clue behind this appears in the Respondent's consideration
    of  whether  paragraph  EX.1  applies.   There  it  is  said  that  the
    Respondent had  considered  whether  the  Appellant  was  "exempt  from
    meeting  certain  eligibility  requirements  under  Section  R-LTRP  of
    Appendix FM" on the basis that EX.1 applied.  Since it is  accepted  in
    the decision that the Appellant meets the suitability  requirements  of
    the Rules, the  relationship  requirements  (E-LTRP.1.1  to  1.12)  and
    immigration status requirements (E-LTRP.2.1 to 2.2), that  leaves  only
    the financial requirements  (E-LTRP.3.1  to  3.4)  and/or  the  English
    language requirements (E-LTRP.4.1-4.2).

63. Whether or not both reasons for rejection  applied  at  that  time,  it
    appears to have been accepted by the Appellant that she could not  meet
    all the requirements as  at  July  2016,  first  because  she  made  an
    application on the ten-year route and  not  the  five-year  route  and,
    second, because that decision was not challenged. I appreciate that the
    Appellant's evidence is that she was poorly  advised  because  at  that
    stage she waited to consider judicial review  proceedings  rather  than
    making a  further  application  immediately.   Whatever,  the  position
    though, she did not bring any  application  to  judicially  review  the
    decision dated 4 December 2017 and her leave to remain  ended  on  that
    date (as would have been  the  position  even  if  she  had  judicially
    reviewed the decision unless the  decision  were  later  withdrawn  for
    reconsideration).  As such, the Appellant has been an overstayer  since
    4 December 2017.

64. Turning then to the second application made by the Appellant, she  made
    that on 17 January 2018.  A copy of the application appears at [AB/403-
    473]. In terms of the financial requirement, the  Appellant  relied  on
    her husband's income of �14,400 per annum and her own income of  �9,360
    per annum, together totalling �23,760 per annum.  In  relation  to  the
    English  language  requirement,  she  relied  on  the  Entry  Level   2
    certificate from Trinity College.

65. The Respondent initially refused the application by letter dated 4 July
    2018 and rejected it as a fresh claim, applying paragraph  353  of  the
    Rules ([AB/389-396]).  That was because the Respondent  had  previously
    certified the human rights claim within the earlier  application  under
    Section 94 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

66. However, following a judicial review challenge to  that  decision,  the
    Respondent agreed to withdraw that decision and reconsider  the  second
    application, culminating in the decision under appeal (see decision  of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede dated 18 January 2019 at [AB/350-351]).  As
    was recognised in the judicial review claim form at  [AB/365-366],  the
    difficulty with the Appellant's case under the  Rules  was  the  income
    threshold requirement and whether it could be met.  It  was  of  course
    also the case that, by this time,  the  Appellant  no  longer  met  the
    immigration status  requirement  under  the  Rules,  her  leave  having
    expired on 4 December 2017 and her next application  having  been  made
    out of time.

67. The reconsideration led then to the Respondent's decision under appeal,
    dated 18 January 2019 which appears at [AB/22-29].  I do  not  need  to
    dwell on the Respondent's reasons for refusing the application save  to
    note that those include not only the Appellant's inability to meet  the
    immigration status requirements due to timing of the second application
    but also an inability to  meet  both  the  financial  requirements  and
    English language requirements due to  insufficiency  of  documentation.
    The evidence as to financial requirements did not  cover  a  sufficient
    period and the English language certificate did not meet the evidential
    requirements.  For those reasons, paragraph  EX.1  continued  to  apply
    and,  the  Respondent  concluded,  was  not  met  as  there   were   no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Turkey.

    DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

68. The essential question in this case is whether there are insurmountable
    obstacles to the family life enjoyed by the Appellant and  her  husband
    continuing in Turkey.  Before I turn to that, though, it is appropriate
    to say something about the Appellant's immigration history as that  may
    be relevant to consideration of the position outside the Rules.

69. I accept that the Appellant entered the UK in accordance with the Rules
    with entry clearance as a spouse.  I  also  accept  that  she  made  an
    application within time to extend her leave in that category.  That was
    refused because paragraph EX.1 was not met.  The  Appellant  insinuates
    by her evidence,  though,  that  if  she  had  either  challenged  that
    decision at that time or  taken  prompter  steps  to  make  the  second
    application, paragraph EX.1 would not have applied at all  because  she
    would not have fallen foul of the immigration  status  requirement.   I
    reject that suggestion for the following reasons.

70. First, there were two principal reasons why the first  application  was
    rejected.  The first was that the couple's income could not be shown to
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules.  Even if the total figure
    at the date of the  first  application  (16  July  2016)  exceeded  the
    minimum income threshold, it could only do so from 1 July 2016 as prior
    to that date the combined earnings of the  Appellant  and  her  husband
    fell short of the �18,800 required.  Their combined income prior  to  1
    July 2016 was �1400.53 per month or �16806.36 per annum.  As such, they
    would not have met  the  evidential  requirements  for  that  threshold
    within the Rules. They were still unable  to  meet  those  requirements
    eighteen months later when making the second application.

71. Second,  the  English  language  documents  did  not  comply  with  the
    evidential requirements even at the time  of  the  second  application.
    Appendix O did not change in its requirements in the interim.   Indeed,
    the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  who  allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    accepted as much (see  extract  cited  at  [15]  of  my  error  of  law
    decision).  Accordingly, the Appellant would still have been unable  to
    satisfy all the requirements within the Rules for leave to remain as  a
    partner without the application of paragraph EX.1.

72. Turning then to whether that test is met  in  this  case,  I  refer  to
    paragraphs [17] and [18] of my error of  law  decision  which  set  out
    respectively the terms of paragraph EX.1. and the relevant parts of the
    judgment in Agyarko and  Ikuga  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] UKSC 11 ("Agyarko").

73. As I accepted at [20] of my error of law decision, it is rarely helpful
    to rely on factual analogies in Article 8 cases.  That comment was made
    in relation to the Respondent's reliance on the similarity between  the
    facts relied upon here, particularly the IVF treatment, and  the  facts
    in the Ikuga case which the Supreme Court  said  were  insufficient  to
    amount to insurmountable obstacles.

74. Furthermore, Ms McCarthy places  reliance  on  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment in Lal v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 1925 ("Lal")  which  judgment  makes  clear  that  it  is  the
    cumulative effects of the various factors which must be considered when
    assessing whether there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing in the Appellant's home country. The Court  of  Appeal  also
    indicated that one has to look at the factors relied on in an objective
    sense rather than on  the  basis  of  what  the  appellant  and/or  the
    appellant's spouse perceive to be the difficulties.  I accept that this
    is the appropriate method of assessment, subject  only  to  the  caveat
    that I must still determine the question whether  return  would  entail
    "very serious hardship" based on the evidence which was before  me  and
    not otherwise (as is made clear by the Court of Appeal at [43]  of  the
    judgment).

75. I turn then to what those factors are in this case.   In  so  doing,  I
    adopt Mr Kotas' submission  that  the  relevant  factors  are  the  IVF
    treatment which  the  couple  are  undertaking,  that  the  Appellant's
    husband has lived in the UK for seventeen years, is a British  citizen,
    is in permanent employment here and has all his family here,  and  that
    the Appellant has had problems  with  her  family,  in  particular  her
    brother, who continue to live in Turkey.

76. I did not understand  Ms  McCarthy  to  disagree  that  those  are  the
    relevant factors.  However,  she  also  submitted  that  those  factors
    require  further  individual  analysis  before  they   are   considered
    cumulatively.  I accept that this is appropriate.

77. Dealing first with the IVF treatment, Ms McCarthy pointed out that  the
    Appellant and her husband have been trying to conceive for a number  of
    years.  Based on the evidence, the couple have  sought  treatment  from
    Guy's and St Thomas' hospital since December 2015.  I accept that  they
    will have grown to trust the team  with  whom  they  are  dealing.   Ms
    McCarthy said that, if they returned to Turkey, they would not be  able
    to continue their treatment - they would have to go back to square  one
    with the implications that would have on success due to the Appellant's
    age.  Although I note that she is currently aged only  twenty-seven,  I
    accept that it will become  more  difficult  to  conceive  as  her  age
    increases.  Ms McCarthy also submitted there would be a knock-on effect
    of a difference in earnings capacity which may  have  implications  for
    the couple's ability to fund the treatment.

78. The difficulty with both of those submissions  is  that  they  are  not
    dealt with in the evidence.  As in the case of Lal, it may well be  the
    Appellant's perception that the couple would  have  to  return  to  the
    beginning of their treatment rather than continuing with  it.   Leaving
    aside that the evidence appears to show that they are nearing  the  end
    of their available options in the UK as they are  left  with  only  one
    frozen embryo, there is no evidence to show that they would not be able
    to take their medical notes  from  the  UK  to  Turkey  or  to  arrange
    transfer of those notes so that they could undertake a  further  course
    of treatment of the same nature as previously in the UK.  That would at
    least obviate the need for the further tests which the  evidence  shows
    were conducted prior to the treatment in the UK.

79. The Appellant accepts that IVF treatment is available in Turkey.  There
    is no evidence as to  the  cost  of  treatment  in  that  country  when
    compared with the cost in the UK (which  is  not  insignificant).   The
    couple are privately paying in the UK and, as I have already  observed,
    their finances indicate that they may struggle to find the money to pay
    the cost of treatment here.  It is not  speculative  to  suggest,  when
    looking at the bank statements in the bundle, that  they  may  have  to
    borrow the money to pay for that treatment here.  There is  nothing  to
    suggest that they could not do likewise in Turkey.

80. Neither is there any evidence of the earnings capacity of the Appellant
    and her husband in Turkey when compared with  the  UK.   The  Appellant
    said that she worked for a time as a tailor  in  Turkey.   She  is  not
    unskilled.  She has not had skilled employment in  the  UK.   I  accept
    that the Appellant's husband has not worked in Turkey - he  left  there
    when he was aged only sixteen.  However, he too has skills working as a
    chef and there is no evidence that he  could  not  find  work  in  that
    capacity or indeed  in  unskilled  work  as  he  appears  to  be  doing
    currently.

81. Although the Appellant's husband has lived in the UK for  seventeen  or
    eighteen years and is now a British citizen,  he  is  clearly  able  to
    speak Turkish.  Indeed, as Mr Kotas observed, his Turkish  is  probably
    better than his English (an observation borne out by some of the  other
    documentary evidence).  The Appellant clearly still  also  speaks  that
    language.

82. The Appellant's husband also comes from Turkey and grew up there.   His
    family come from that country.  I appreciate that  he  and  his  family
    came here as a refugee and family due, it appears, to their  ethnicity.
    However, the evidence is that the  Appellant  has  returned  to  Turkey
    albeit for short periods as has his mother.  There is no evidence  from
    his father.  More importantly, there is no evidence relied  upon  about
    the current difficulties for Alevi Kurds.  The  Appellant's  father-in-
    law obtained refugee status about two decades ago.

83. That brings me on to the issue of the Appellant's family  situation  in
    Turkey.  Accepting for these purposes that she no  longer  has  contact
    with her family there and that she has had the problems  she  says  she
    has in the past, in particular with one of her brothers,  there  is  no
    reason why she and her husband have to return to her hometown.

84. I was told that the Appellant's aunt with whom  she  lived  before  she
    came to the UK lived in the same province as the  Appellant's  hometown
    but, although the Appellant's brother tried to contact  her  there,  he
    was not able to do her harm.  I recognise that the Appellant's aunt  no
    longer  lives  in  Turkey.  However,  the  evidence  shows   that   the
    Appellant's brother would not be able to trace her even  if  she  moved
    somewhere within the same province, let alone if she  and  her  husband
    moved to one of the larger cities in Turkey.  There is no evidence that
    the Appellant's brother has tried to make contact with her or  threaten
    her since she came to the UK.  She is said to  have  lost  all  contact
    with her family and there is no evidence to show that  her  brother  or
    any other family member has any continued interest in  her  whereabouts
    or her relationship.

85. I accept that the Appellant may have some mental  health  problems  but
    there is no formal diagnosis of any mental health  condition.   She  is
    not receiving medication for her mental health.  There is  no  evidence
    that she is undergoing any other treatment on a regular  basis.   There
    is no evidence on which I can place weight which indicates that  return
    to Turkey would cause a deterioration in her mental  health  condition.
    That condition is, as the evidence shows, likely to be  caused  by  the
    IVF treatment and concerns about infertility as well as the Appellant's
    immigration status.  The  former  trigger  will  continue  whether  the
    Appellant is in the UK or in Turkey and the latter will cease to  exist
    once the Appellant's status is resolved.  I  accept  that  the  anxiety
    about continuation of IVF in  Turkey  may  exacerbate  the  Appellant's
    mental health condition to some extent in the short-term (as  a  matter
    of common sense) but there is no evidence to show that  it  would  have
    such a serious effect as to amount to an insurmountable obstacle to her
    return to Turkey.

86. I do not accept  that  the  family  circumstances  of  the  Appellant's
    husband in the UK amount to any obstacle, let alone  an  insurmountable
    one, preventing his return to Turkey.  There is evidence  that  [F]  is
    registered  disabled,  it  appears  because  he  is  severely  visually
    impaired.  He also suffers from  other  medical  conditions.   However,
    there is no evidence that he is so disabled that he requires  the  sort
    of personal care and assistance  which  requires  heavy  lifting  on  a
    regular basis.  He is said to live an active lifestyle.  Nor  is  there
    any evidence to show that if such assistance is required  to  help  the
    Appellant's mother-in-law with  [F]'s  care  that  this  could  not  be
    provided by the Appellant's father-in-law or brother-in-law.

87. I accept that the Appellant and her husband are part of the family unit
    with his family in the UK but that does not mean that they enjoy family
    life in legal terms.  The couple live apart from his  family  and  have
    their own lives.  Whilst return of the Appellant and her husband  would
    no  doubt  be  upsetting  for  his  family,  that  upset  is   not   an
    insurmountable obstacle to the Appellant's husband returning to  Turkey
    with her.

88.  Having  considered  those  factors   individually,   when   considered
    cumulatively, I conclude that there are no insurmountable obstacles  to
    the Appellant's family life with her husband continuing in Turkey.

89. The Appellant will be able to  access  IVF  in  Turkey.   There  is  no
    evidence to show that the earnings capacity of the  Appellant  and  her
    husband would be any less than in the UK, particularly when the cost of
    treatment is set against  the  cost  in  the  UK.   They  may  find  it
    difficult to pay for that treatment, but the evidence is that they  may
    find it difficult to do so also in the UK.

90. There is no evidence that the Appellant and her husband  would  not  be
    able to find work, either that for which they  are  skilled,  or  other
    unskilled labour.  They would not have to  return  to  the  Appellant's
    hometown or even home province.  They could relocate to another part of
    Turkey. There is no evidence  that  the  Appellant's  family  have  any
    continued interest in her and  would  try  or  be  able  to  trace  her
    elsewhere in Turkey.

91. There is no evidence as to the discrimination suffered by  Alevi  Kurds
    nor indeed whether that is the same throughout Turkey or is confined to
    the Appellant's husband's home area.  I note in that regard,  that  the
    Appellant's father acquired refugee  status  nearly  two  decades  ago.
    There is evidence that the Appellant and his mother  have  returned  to
    Turkey since they came to the UK, albeit for short periods.

92. The evidence does not show that there would be such a deterioration  in
    the Appellant's mental health on return that removal would cause  "very
    serious hardship" for her.  Nor does the evidence show that the  effect
    on the Appellant's husband of separation from  his  family  in  the  UK
    would have such consequences.

93. The Appellant left Turkey about seven years ago.   However,  she  lived
    there until she was in her early  twenties.   The  Appellant's  husband
    lived there until he  was  aged  sixteen.   Both  speak  Turkish.   The
    Appellant's  husband's  family  also  come  from  Turkey  and  he  will
    therefore have grown up with the culture from that country.

94. For all those reasons, the Appellant has failed to show that there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with her husband continuing  in
    Turkey.  Paragraph EX.1. is not met.  Accordingly, the Appellant cannot
    meet the requirements of the Rules.

95. Turning then to the case outside the Rules, I do not need to repeat the
    factors above which constitute the interference  with  the  Appellant's
    family life and that of her husband.  In relation to her  private  life
    and that of her husband, whilst they may prefer to live in the UK,  the
    evidence does not show that there are very significant obstacles to the
    Appellant's integration in Turkey.

96. I have already dealt with the Appellant's case concerning problems with
    her family and her mental health condition.   I  do  not  repeat  those
    matters.  As I have already observed, the Appellant grew up  in  Turkey
    and  lived  there  until  she  was  aged  twenty-one.    Although   the
    Appellant's husband left at an earlier age, he too grew up  in  Turkey.
    Both speak Turkish.  I accept that the Appellant and her husband  going
    to live in Turkey will be upsetting for his family.  However, there  is
    no reason why they cannot go to visit them there.

97. The issue outside the Rules is whether the effect  of  the  Appellant's
    removal  is  unjustifiably  harsh  when  balanced  against  the  public
    interest.  In that regard, I refer to the extract from the judgment  in
    Agyarko set out at [19] of my error of law decision.

98. When considering the case outside the Rules, I am bound to have  regard
    to Section 117B.  Maintenance of effective immigration  control  is  in
    the public interest. That is particularly important where, as here, the
    Appellant is unable to meet the  Rules  which  are  laid  down  by  the
    Respondent as guidance as to the appropriate balance between individual
    rights and the public interest.

99. As I have already recorded, in this case the Appellant entered  the  UK
    with leave as a spouse and remained here  lawfully.   However,  at  the
    point when she sought to extend her leave, she was unable to  meet  the
    Rules (unless she could show that there were  insurmountable  obstacles
    to family life continuing in Turkey) due to an inability  to  meet  the
    evidential requirements in  relation  to  the  financial  threshold  or
    English language ability.

100. I accept that Section 117B does not require  me  to  give  only  little
    weight to the Appellant's family life as it was formed whilst  she  was
    here lawfully at least until 4 December 2017.  In terms of her  private
    life, however, she has had only limited leave and therefore I can  give
    that private life only little weight.  The factors relied upon  by  the
    Appellant however are largely concerned with her family life  with  her
    husband and I accept that this should be given such weight as is due to
    it based on the evidence.  I bear in mind, however, what is said by the
    Supreme Court in Agyarko about the circumstances in which a family life
    established whilst  in  the  UK  precariously  is  likely  to  tip  the
    proportionality balance in favour of an appellant  (see  [54]  of  that
    judgment as set out at [19] of my error of law decision).

101. Section 117B also requires me to have regard to whether  the  Appellant
    is able to support herself without recourse to public funds.   Although
    the evidence suggests that the Appellant and her husband have had  some
    financial assistance with IVF treatment, he, as a British  citizen,  is
    entitled to that assistance where it is available and I accept  on  the
    evidence that the Appellant has supported herself without  recourse  to
    public funds.  Although  I  have  expressed  some  concerns  about  the
    Appellant's English language ability, she has certificates showing that
    she has passed tests in speaking, reading and writing and I also accept
    that she is able to speak English, at least to the extent necessary for
    day-to-day life.  However, both of those factors  are  neutral  in  the
    proportionality balance.

102. Balancing the interference with  the  Appellant's  private  and  family
    life and that of her husband and the impact  on  her  husband's  family
    against the public interest, I  have  concluded  that  removal  of  the
    Appellant is proportionate for the reasons which follow.

103. Whilst I accept that  the  Appellant  has  only  remained  here  as  an
    overstayer whilst trying to regularise her status having made her first
    application to extend leave in time, I place weight on  the  fact  that
    she could not meet the Rules at that time and is still unable to do  so
    unless she can show that paragraph EX.1. is met. Whilst  the  Appellant
    may have been able to satisfy the Rules as  to  financial  support  and
    English language in principle by the time of this appeal, she  was  and
    still is unable properly to evidence that she meets those requirements,
    at least so far as English language is concerned.  In addition, she  is
    now an  overstayer  and  therefore  cannot  satisfy  the  Rules  unless
    paragraph EX.1. is met.

104. Moreover, the reason that the Appellant is unable to satisfy the  Rules
    without those requirements turns on the conclusion I have reached  that
    there are no insurmountable obstacles to her continuing her family life
    with her husband in her home country. As such, the impact on the family
    and private lives of the Appellant and her  husband  which  I  have  to
    weigh in the balance  is  less  than  the  situation  which  was  being
    considered by the Supreme  Court  in  R  (MM  (Lebanon)  and  others  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 10 on which  the
    Appellant places some reliance.  In some of those cases which  involved
    entry clearance decisions, the impact of refusal based  on  failure  to
    meet the income threshold was to maintain a split in  the  family  life
    because the spouse living in the UK could not go to  join  his  or  her
    foreign national spouse.  That is not this case.  In this case, I  have
    concluded that the Appellant is unable to show that she cannot continue
    her family life in Turkey.  It is  for  that  reason  that  she  cannot
    satisfy the Rules.  That is relevant to  the  strength  of  the  public
    interest being weighed in the balance.   Even  in  the  MM  cases,  the
    Supreme Court recognised the need to give weight to  the  "considerable
    weight to judgments made by the Secretary of State in the  exercise  of
    her constitutional responsibility for immigration policy" ([75] of  the
    judgment).

105. Whilst  I  recognise  that  a  failure  to  meet  the  Rules  does  not
    automatically mean that an appeal will  fail  outside  the  Rules,  the
    inability to meet the Rules is highly relevant to  the  assessment  and
    the strength of the public interest.  In particular,  I  bear  in  mind
    what is said at [46] to [48] of the judgment in Agyarko as follows:

         "46.  In  considering  that  question  [whether  the  situation  is
         compatible with Article 8], it is important to appreciate that  the
         Rules are not simply the product of a legal analysis: they are  not
         intended to be a summary of the Strasbourg case law on  article  8.
         As was explained at para 10  above,  they  are  statements  of  the
         practice to be followed, which are approved by Parliament, and  are
         based on the Secretary of  State's  policy  as  to  how  individual
         rights under article 8 should be  balanced  against  the  competing
         public interests. They are designed to operate on  the  basis  that
         decisions taken in accordance with them are compatible with article
         8 in all but exceptional  cases.  The  Secretary  of  State  is  in
         principle entitled to have a policy of the kind which underpins the
         Rules. While the European court has provided guidance as to factors
         which should be taken into account, it has  acknowledged  that  the
         weight to be attached to the competing considerations, in  striking
         a fair balance, falls within the  margin  of  appreciation  of  the
         national authorities, subject to supervision at the European level.
         The  margin  of  appreciation  of  national  authorities   is   not
         unlimited, but it is nevertheless real and  important.  Immigration
         control is an intensely political issue, on which  differing  views
         are held within  the  contracting  states,  and  as  between  those
         states. The ECHR has therefore to be applied in a manner  which  is
         capable of accommodating different approaches, within limits. Under
         the constitutional arrangements existing within the UK, the  courts
         can review the compatibility  of  decision-making  in  relation  to
         immigration  with  the  Convention  rights,  but  the   authorities
         responsible for determining  policy  in  relation  to  immigration,
         within the limits of the national margin of appreciation,  are  the
         Secretary of State and Parliament.

         47.   The  Rules  therefore  reflect  the  responsible   Minister's
         assessment, at a general level,  of  the  relative  weight  of  the
         competing factors when striking a fair balance under article 8. The
         courts can review that general assessment in  the  event  that  the
         decision-making process is challenged as  being  incompatible  with
         Convention rights or based on an  erroneous  understanding  of  the
         law, but they have  to  bear  in  mind  the  Secretary  of  State's
         constitutional responsibility for policy  in  this  area,  and  the
         endorsement of the Rules by Parliament. It is also the function  of
         the courts to consider individual cases which come before  them  on
         appeal or by way of judicial review, and that will require them  to
         consider how the balance is struck in individual  cases.  In  doing
         so, they have to take the Secretary of State's policy into  account
         and to attach considerable weight to it at a general level, as well
         as considering all the factors which are relevant to the particular
         case. This was explained in Hesham Ali at paras 44-46, 50 and 53.

         48.  The Secretary of State's view that the public interest in  the
         removal of persons who are in the UK in breach of immigration  laws
         is, in all but exceptional circumstances,  sufficiently  compelling
         to outweigh the individual's interest in family life with a partner
         in the UK, unless there are insurmountable obstacles to family life
         with that partner continuing outside the UK, is challenged in these
         proceedings as being too stringent to be compatible with article 8.
         It  is  argued  that   the   Secretary   of   State   has   treated
         "insurmountable obstacles" as a test applicable to persons  in  the
         UK in breach of immigration laws, whereas the European court treats
         it as a relevant factor in relation to non-settled  migrants.  That
         is true, but it does not mean that the Secretary of State's test is
         incompatible with article 8. As has been explained, the  Rules  are
         not a summary of the European court's case law, but a statement  of
         the Secretary of State's policy. That policy is  qualified  by  the
         scope allowed for leave to remain to be granted outside the  Rules.
         If the applicant or his or her partner would face very  significant
         difficulties in continuing their family life together  outside  the
         UK, which could not  be  overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious
         hardship, then the "insurmountable obstacles" test will be met, and
         leave will be granted under the Rules. If that test is not met, but
         the refusal of the application would result in unjustifiably  harsh
         consequences, such that refusal would not  be  proportionate,  then
         leave will be granted outside the Rules on the basis that there are
         "exceptional   circumstances".   In   the   absence    of    either
         "insurmountable  obstacles"  or  "exceptional   circumstances"   as
         defined, however, it is not apparent why it should be  incompatible
         with article 8 for leave to be refused. The Rules and  Instructions
         are therefore compatible with article 8. That is not, of course, to
         say  that  decisions  applying  the  Rules  and   Instructions   in
         individual cases will necessarily be  compatible  with  article  8:
         that is a question which, if a  decision  is  challenged,  must  be
         determined independently by the court or tribunal in the  light  of
         the particular circumstances of each case."

106. It cannot be said that there are any such  "exceptional  circumstances"
    in this  case.   Put  another  way,  when  the  interference  with  the
    Appellant's family and private life is  balanced  against  that  public
    interest, the consequences of removal are not unjustifiably harsh.  For
    that reason, the Appellant's case fails also outside the Rules.

    CONCLUSION

107. For the foregoing  reasons,  the  Appellant  is  unable  to  show  that
    paragraph EX.1. is met. There are no insurmountable obstacles to family
    life with her husband continuing in Turkey.  For that reason, her claim
    under the Rules fails.  When balanced against the public interest,  the
    removal of the Appellant is not unjustifiably harsh.  The  decision  to
    remove the  Appellant  is  proportionate  and  therefore  lawful  under
    Section 6 Human Rights Act 1998.

The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    BACKGROUND

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  For ease of reference,  I
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.   The
    Respondent appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  C
    Greasley promulgated on 8 August 2019  ("the  Decision")  allowing  the
    Appellant's appeal on human  rights  grounds  (Article  8  ECHR).   The
    Appellant is a national of Turkey.  Her human rights claim is based  on
    her relationship with her husband, [AE], who is also of Turkish  origin
    but who has lived in the UK for seventeen years and is  now  a  British
    citizen.  The  Appellant's  human  rights  claim  was  refused  by  the
    Respondent by the decision under appeal, dated 18 January 2019.

 2.  The  Judge  accepted  that  the  Appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the
    Immigration Rules ("the Rules") based on her family and  private  life.
    The Respondent had given three reasons why she was  unable  to  do  so.
    First, the Appellant and her husband were unable  to  meet  the  income
    threshold under the Rules ("the MIR").  Second, although the  Appellant
    was found by the  Judge  to  speak  English,  she  did  not  produce  a
    certificate in proper form. Third, the  Appellant  had  overstayed  her
    leave to remain.  Accordingly, the Respondent concluded that, in  order
    to  succeed,  the  Appellant  would  have  to  show  that   there   are
    "insurmountable obstacles" to family life continuing in Turkey in order
    to satisfy paragraph EX.1. of Appendix FM to the Rules ("EX.1.").   The
    Respondent concluded that the Appellant could not meet that test.

 3. Having accepted that the Appellant could not meet the Rules, the  Judge
    went directly to an assessment of Article  8  outside  the  Rules.   He
    concluded that the Respondent's decision to remove  the  Appellant  was
    disproportionate.

 4. The Respondent appeals on the  basis  that  the  Judge  has  failed  to
    provide adequate reasons  for  his  findings,  has  failed  to  make  a
    material finding of fact and has misdirected himself in law.  The first
    ground focusses on the Judge's failure to  consider  whether  EX.1.  is
    met.  It is asserted that  this  failure  contaminates  the  assessment
    outside the Rules.  The second ground is a failure to explain  why  the
    undergoing  of  IVF  treatment  amounts  to  an   unjustifiably   harsh
    consequence given the Supreme Court's observations in Agyarko and Ikuga
    v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2017]   UKSC   11
    ("Agyarko").  The Appellant in  the  Ikuga  case  was  also  undergoing
    fertility  treatment.   The  Supreme  Court   rejected   that   as   an
    insurmountable obstacle or a sufficiently exceptional  circumstance  to
    justify the grant of leave to remain.  The third ground challenges  the
    Judge's failure to consider whether IVF could be  continued  in  Turkey
    and whether the Appellant's mental health would be worse if removed  to
    Turkey either in the presence of her husband or not.

 5. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes on
    18 November 2019 in the following terms so far as relevant:

         "... 3.  It is right that the judge did not  expressly  state  that
         there were insurmountable obstacles to family life being  continued
         in Turkey.  He did however refer to no issue being taken  with  the
         observations of Tarka Mustafa and that report highlighted  that  it
         would be very detrimental to the appellant's well-being and  sanity
         if she were "sent back" to Turkey.

         4.   It is right that fertility treatment in itself may not  amount
         to an exceptional circumstance but the judge was entitled  to  look
         at all the circumstances in the round which included not  only  the
         fertility treatment but also the  appellant's  mental  health  and,
         significantly  the  fact  that  the   financial   requirements   of
         immigration rules were met, that the appellant was  able  to  speak
         English and she had only overstayed for a limited  period  of  time
         because she had not appreciated her position about submitting a new
         application.  The report of Tarka Mustafa with which no issues were
         taken explains the reason why the appellant's mental  health  would
         worsen in Turkey; the judge was entitled to conclude  that  bearing
         in mind that her husband would remain in the  UK  and  taking  into
         account all the circumstances  the  refusal  was  disproportionate.
         The contrary is not arguable."

 6. On renewed application to  this  Tribunal,  permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker in the following terms:

         "1.  It is arguable the First-tier Tribunal Judge  failed  to  give
         adequate or any weight to the failure of the appellant to meet  the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules.

         2.   It is arguable the First-tier Tribunal judge failed  to  apply
         EX1 and failed to make any or any  adequate  findings  in  relation
         thereto.

         3.   I grant permission on all grounds."

 7. The matter comes before me to determine whether the Decision contains a
    material error of law and, if it does, to re-make the decision or remit
    the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.

    THE EVIDENCE AND THE DECISION

 8. Before I turn to consider the grounds, I set out the relevant  evidence
    and passages of the Decision so that the discussion which  follows  can
    be understood in context.

 9. Dealing first with the Appellant's immigration history, she came to the
    UK with entry clearance as a spouse on 12 November 2013.  Her leave was
    valid to 31 July 2016.  In July 2016, she applied for further leave  on
    the ten years' route to settlement.  The application was refused  on  4
    December 2017 and certified as clearly unfounded.  Her leave to  remain
    therefore expired upon service of that decision as she had a  right  of
    appeal only from outside the UK.   She considers with  the  benefit  of
    hindsight that she ought to have judicially  reviewed  the  refusal  on
    that occasion.  That would have made no difference to whether her leave
    continued at that time.  As it was, she made a further  application  on
    17 January 2018 which was also refused in July 2018 as not amounting to
    a fresh claim.  At that point in  time,  she  judicially  reviewed  the
    decision (in September 2018).  The  July  decision  was  withdrawn  and
    reconsidered.  The  Judge  said  at  [6]  of  the  Decision  that   the
    application was submitted 43 days after the Appellant's leave  expired.
    Although  that  is  true  of  the  January  2018  application  and  the
    Respondent withdrew the July decision and agreed to  reconsider  (again
    refusing leave), it does not mean that the overstaying is  confined  to
    that period.  The Appellant has had no leave to remain in the UK  since
    the December 2017 decision was served. The application made in  January
    2018  was  eventually  refused  by  the  decision  under  appeal,   the
    Respondent having issued the further  decision  letter  on  18  January
    2019.

10. The Appellant married her husband on 16 June 2012 in Turkey.  As I have
    already noted, he originates from Turkey but is now a British  citizen.
    He has lived in the  UK  for  seventeen  years.  As  appears  from  his
    statement, he is in full-time employment in the UK.   As  appears  from
    other documents in the Appellant's bundle, he  is  an  Advertising  and
    Distribution Assistant employed on a permanent basis by Emirtax Ltd  on
    a gross salary of �19,200 per annum.  He began this  job  on  6  August
    2018.  Prior to that date, he worked as  a  chef  for  Eren  Kebab  Ltd
    trading as Eastern Delight on a salary of  �11,232  and  then  for  Son
    Chare Ltd, Utkueren Ltd, Korkmaz Catering Ltd, Denhaz Ltd and  Dalkilic
    Ltd.  He earnt �13,041.46 in the tax year to 5 April 2017.  He was on a
    salary of �14,400 per annum on 15 January 2018 when the application was
    made (working for Korkmaz Ltd).  It is therefore as  a  result  of  his
    change of employment that the Appellant and her husband are now able to
    meet the MIR (as the Judge found to be the  position  at  [27]  of  the
    Decision).

11. The Appellant had also been employed part-time as a cleaner and kitchen
    porter and then for London Bar Staff Ltd but was not employed as at the
    date of the hearing before Judge Greasley ([19] of the Decision).

12. The Appellant and her husband are undergoing IVF treatment in  the  UK.
    The Judge noted at [19] of the Decision that this was still  continuing
    and that the next cycle would resume in September 2019.   Although  the
    Judge there noted the Appellant's acceptance that IVF is  available  in
    Turkey, she said that "she would need her husband there to  participate
    in the program and he was in full-time work in the United Kingdom."

13. The Appellant has family in Turkey in  the  form  of  her  parents  and
    brothers although, according to what is said at [19] of  the  Decision,
    she is not in contact with  them.   The  Judge  says  at  [18]  of  the
    Decision that the Appellant has been refused asylum on  two  occasions.
    There is nothing in the immigration history which I have set out  above
    which supports that assertion and nor does the Appellant say that  this
    is the case.  She refers obliquely at [14] of her statement  to  having
    suffered domestic violence at the hands of her brother but does not say
    that she feared ill-treatment on return  to  Turkey.   She  says  that,
    because she comes from a rural area in  Turkey,  she  feared  that  her
    husband's family would put pressure on him to find a wife who  is  able
    to conceive.  However, I can find nothing in her statement  to  support
    the finding at [18] of the Decision that "the appellant would suffer at
    the hands  of  her  family  and  community  due  to  her  inability  to
    conceive".  Nor can  I  find  anything  in  the  Appellant's  husband's
    statement to support the finding that he would be  unable  to  relocate
    (or indeed has any necessity to do so) if he were to return to Turkey.

14. Mr Wilford had no instructions about any asylum claim.  What is said by
    the Judge in that regard and his findings about potential ill-treatment
    on return appears to come from what is said in  the  report  of  Tarkan
    Mustafa, MA who is an Associate Member of the School of Natural  Health
    Sciences.  The fact of an asylum  claim  having  been  refused  on  two
    occasions appears as part of the narrative in that  report  as  do  the
    other references which I have set out  above.   Mr  Kotas  very  fairly
    accepted that, as the report was not challenged by  the  Respondent  at
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing nor in the grounds, he could say little
    about it by way of formal criticism.      It does appear that  what  is
    said by the Judge at [18] of the Decision is lifted from  this  report.
    However, Mr Kotas' point is that, irrespective  of  any  contradictions
    with other supporting evidence about what is there said, the report  is
    merely a narrative of what he has apparently been  told  and  the  only
    salient opinion offered is to be found in the penultimate sentence that
    if the  Appellant  were  sent  back  to  Turkey  "this  would  be  very
    detrimental to her well-being and her  sanity".   There  is  no  formal
    diagnosis as to the reasons for the Appellant's mental health  problems
    nor  any  formal,  reasoned  prognosis  for  the  future.  I  note  for
    completeness that it is not clear that Mr Mustafa was  aware  that  his
    report would be used in court proceedings nor that he intended to offer
    any view as an expert.  The report is headed "TO WHOM IT MAY  CONCERN".
    There is no reference to his duty to the Tribunal  as  an  expert.  The
    report does not set out his relevant expertise.

15. Having set out the evidence which I have summarised so far as  relevant
    above at [10] to [20] of the Decision, the Judge made his assessment of
    the Article 8 claim in the following passage:

         "23. I accept as Mrs McCarthy concedes, that this appeal cannot  be
         allowed  under  the  United   Kingdom   immigration   rules   based
         principally on the fact that the appellant  was  an  overstayer  43
         days and given that the English language certificate upon which the
         appellant relies, is not accepted  certificate,  at  an  acceptable
         level, for purposes of the UK immigration rules.

         24.  I must therefore go on and  consider  whether  there  are  any
         exceptional circumstances beyond the immigration  rules  which  are
         likely to give rise to undue  hardship  for  the  appellant  to  be
         removed to Turkey.

         25.  For reasons that  follow,  based  upon  the  totality  of  the
         evidence before me, including that which I  have  not  specifically
         referred, I find that this appeal must be allowed substantively  in
         terms of Article 8 ECHR family and private life interests, under  a
         classic Razgar analysis.

         26.  I accept that the appellant and sponsor are in a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship.  This was not  challenged  either  in  the
         refusal decision, or indeed at the appeal hearing.  I  also  accept
         that the appellant is undergoing IVF treatment  together  with  her
         husband and unfortunately, to date, this  treatment  has  not  been
         successful.  I also accept that there is ongoing treatment and that
         the next cycle is due to begin in September 2019.  The treatment is
         being taken at the Guys and St  Thomas's  Hospital  who  will  have
         biological records of all the treatment taken thus  far,  including
         storage of sperm  samples  which  the  appellant  and  sponsor  are
         currently paying for.

         27.  I do not find that it is simply a question  of  the  appellant
         and her husband being able to relocate to Turkey and recommence IVF
         with a different clinic and with different  medical  personnel.   I
         accept entirely that  the  IVF  process  is  likely  to  be  highly
         stressful, and will involve a degree  of  anxiety  and  depression.
         These are matters which had been highlighted  in  the  report  from
         Tarka Mustafa of 23 July 2019.   No  issue  was  taken  with  these
         observations.  I also accept the sponsor is in  gainful  employment
         in the United Kingdom where he supports his  wife,  the  appellant.
         He is now resided in the United Kingdom for  17  years.   Whilst  I
         accept that the sponsor now satisfies financial requirements  under
         the rules, unfortunately the English language certificate which the
         appellant provides is  not  compliant  with  current  requirements;
         nonetheless, I do accept that the appellant was able to speak  some
         English at the appeal although I understand why  she  did  in  fact
         elect to use an interpreter for purposes of getting formal evidence
         at the hearing.

         28.  Whilst I note that the appellant did technically overstay  for
         43 days in the United Kingdom, I accept  that  she  only  did  this
         because  she  did  not  decide  to  pursue  the   judicial   review
         application, and instead made the thought of the  paid  application
         [sic] for leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  I accept this  is
         the only point in her otherwise unblemished immigration history  in
         the United Kingdom.

         29.  I also accept that the appellant and sponsor have  one  frozen
         embryo in the United Kingdom; it is likely that this  may  well  be
         used in any future treatment.  In all the  circumstances,  and  for
         the reasons stated, when considering  classic  Razgar  analysis,  I
         accept that the appellant and sponsor have established a  right  to
         family and private life in the  United  Kingdom  and  ultimately  I
         conclude that removal would not properly serve any public  interest
         in terms of proper immigration control, and would therefore be both
         unlawful and disproportionate.

         30.  I accept the IVF treatment is likely to be time limited and to
         become increasingly expensive  the  longer  there  is  delay.   The
         appellant genuinely suffers from depression and anxiety,  not  only
         linked  to  her  infertility  problem  but  also   her   unresolved
         immigration status.  I find that her  personal  circumstances,  and
         her current medical conditions, are likely to be exacerbated if she
         is forced to separate from a husband and returned to  Turkey,  even
         to seek re-entry.   Having  her  husband  present  with  her  is  a
         critical factor in their family and private life interests at  this
         time.

         31.  I have also considered the principles appearing within section
         117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  I accept
         that the financial requirements are met and that the  appellant  is
         able  to  speak  some  English  as  well  as  to   be   financially
         independent.  These are both matters which  the  above  legislation
         deems individuals better able to integrate into UK society."

    DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

16. I begin with the ground on which Mr Kotas focussed namely  the  Judge's
    failure to consider paragraph EX.1.  Mr Wilford accepted that this  was
    not considered but said it was not an error or at least not a  material
    one.

17. Paragraph EX.1. reads as follows (so far as relevant):

         "EX.1. This paragraph applies if

         (a)  ...; or

         (b)  the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
         life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
         would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
         partner."

18.  The  Supreme  Court  in  Agyarko  considered  the   meaning   of   the
    "insurmountable obstacles" requirement at [43] to [45] of the  judgment
    as follows:

         "43.  It  appears  that  the  European  court  intends  the   words
         "insurmountable obstacles" to be  understood  in  a  practical  and
         realistic sense, rather than as referring solely to obstacles which
         make it literally impossible for the family to live together in the
         country of origin of the non-national concerned. In some cases, the
         court has used other  expressions  which  make  that  clearer:  for
         example, referring to "un obstacle majeur" (Sen v  The  Netherlands
         (2003) 36 EHRR 7, para 40), or  to  "major  impediments"  (Tuquabo-
         Tekle v The Netherlands [2006] 1 FLR 798, para 48), or to "the test
         of 'insurmountable obstacles' or 'major impediments'" (IAA v United
         Kingdom (2016) 62 EHRR SE 19, paras 40 and 44),  or  asking  itself
         whether the family could "realistically" be expected to move (Sezen
         v The Netherlands (2006) 43  EHRR  30,  para  47).  "Insurmountable
         obstacles" is,  however,  the  expression  employed  by  the  Grand
         Chamber; and the court's application of it indicates that it  is  a
         stringent test. In Jeunesse, for example, there were said to be  no
         insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  relocation  of  the  family  to
         Suriname,  although  the  children,  the  eldest  of  whom  was  at
         secondary school, were Dutch nationals  who  had  lived  there  all
         their lives, had never visited Suriname,  and  would  experience  a
         degree of hardship if forced to move, and the  applicant's  partner
         was in full-time employment in the Netherlands: see paras  117  and
         119.

         44.   Domestically,  the  expression   "insurmountable   obstacles"
         appears in paragraph EX.1(b)  of  Appendix  FM  to  the  Rules.  As
         explained in para 15 above, that paragraph applies in  cases  where
         an applicant for leave to remain under the partner route is in  the
         UK in breach of immigration laws, and requires that there should be
         insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life   with   that   partner
         continuing  outside  the   UK.   The   expression   "insurmountable
         obstacles" is now  defined  by  paragraph  EX.2  as  meaning  "very
         significant difficulties which would be faced by the  applicant  or
         their partner in continuing their family life together outside  the
         UK and which could not be overcome or  would  entail  very  serious
         hardship for the  applicant  or  their  partner."  That  definition
         appears to me to be  consistent  with  the  meaning  which  can  be
         derived from the Strasbourg case  law.  As  explained  in  para  16
         above, paragraph EX.2 was not introduced until after the  dates  of
         the decisions in the present cases. Prior to the insertion of  that
         definition,  it  would  nevertheless  be   reasonable   to   infer,
         consistently with the Secretary of State's statutory  duty  to  act
         compatibly with Convention rights, that the expression was intended
         to bear the same meaning in the Rules as in the Strasbourg case law
         from which it was  derived.  I  would  therefore  interpret  it  as
         bearing the same meaning as is now set out in paragraph EX.2.

         45.  By virtue of paragraph EX.1(b), "insurmountable obstacles" are
         treated as a requirement for the grant of leave under the Rules  in
         cases to which that paragraph  applies.  Accordingly,  interpreting
         the expression in the same sense as in  the  Strasbourg  case  law,
         leave to remain would not normally be granted  in  cases  where  an
         applicant for leave to remain under the partner route was in the UK
         in breach of  immigration  laws,  unless  the  applicant  or  their
         partner would face very serious difficulties  in  continuing  their
         family life together outside the UK, which could not be overcome or
         would entail very serious hardship.  Even  in  a  case  where  such
         difficulties  do  not  exist,  however,   leave   to   remain   can
         nevertheless  be  granted  outside  the   Rules   in   "exceptional
         circumstances", in accordance with the  Instructions:  that  is  to
         say,  in  "circumstances  in  which   refusal   would   result   in
         unjustifiably harsh  consequences  for  the  individual  such  that
         refusal of the application would not be proportionate."

19. The Supreme Court held that the requirements were Article 8  compliant,
    recognising that the requirements  reflected  the  Minister's  view  of
    where the public interest lay.  As the Supreme Court also  made  clear,
    even where those requirements are not met, an applicant  may  still  be
    granted leave if the consequences of removal result are  "unjustifiably
    harsh". However, as the Supreme Court went on to say  when  looking  at
    the grant of leave to remain outside the Rules, this will only arise in
    exceptional circumstances. The rationale for that approach is explained
    at [54] and [55] of the judgment as follows:

         "54. As explained in para 49 above, the  European  court  has  said
         that, in  cases  concerned  with  precarious  family  life,  it  is
         "likely" only to be in exceptional circumstances that  the  removal
         of the non-national family member will constitute  a  violation  of
         article 8. That reflects the weight  attached  to  the  contracting
         states' right to control their borders, as an  attribute  of  their
         sovereignty, and the limited weight which is generally attached  to
         family life established in the full knowledge that its continuation
         in the contracting state is unlawful or precarious. The  court  has
         repeatedly acknowledged that "a state is entitled, as a  matter  of
         well-established international  law,  and  subject  to  its  treaty
         obligations,  to  control  the  entry  of  non-nationals  into  its
         territory and their residence there" (Jeunesse, para 100). As  the
         court has made clear, the Convention is not intended  to  undermine
         that right by enabling non-nationals to evade  immigration  control
         by establishing a family life  while  present  in  the  host  state
         unlawfully or temporarily, and  then  presenting  it  with  a  fait
         accompli. On the contrary, "where confronted with a  fait  accompli
         the removal of the non-national family member  by  the  authorities
         would  be  incompatible  with  article  8   only   in   exceptional
         circumstances" (Jeunesse, para 114).

         55.  That statement reflects the strength of the claim  which  will
         normally be  required,  if  the  contracting  state's  interest  in
         immigration control is to be outweighed. In the Jeunesse case,  for
         example,  the  Dutch  authorities'  tolerance  of  the  applicant's
         unlawful presence in that country  for  a  very  prolonged  period,
         during which she developed strong family and social ties there, led
         the court to conclude that the circumstances were  exceptional  and
         that a fair balance had not been struck  (paras  121-122).  As  the
         court put it, in view of the particular circumstances of the  case,
         it was  questionable  whether  general  immigration  considerations
         could be regarded as  sufficient  justification  for  refusing  the
         applicant residence in the host state (para 121)."

20. Although I accept, as the Respondent asserts in the grounds,  that  the
    circumstances of Mrs Ikuga in Agyarko bear  some  similarities  to  the
    Appellant's  case  (fertility  treatment  and  husband   in   full-time
    employment in the UK), it is rarely helpful to consider Article 8 based
    on an analogy with the facts of another case as each case turns on  its
    own facts.

21. Mr Wilford accepted that, if the only barrier to the Appellant  meeting
    the Rules had been the  Appellant's  immigration  status,  rather  than
    being the combined effect of the lack of English  language  certificate
    and lack of status, the Judge could not have  circumvented  the  proper
    consideration whether the Appellant could meet the Rules by not looking
    at paragraph EX.1.  That was clearly relevant when status was at issue.
     As I pointed out, the situation ought not to be any  different  merely
    because there was an additional reason for  refusal  under  the  Rules.
    Although he accepted the validity of that point, he said that the error
    was not material because the Judge had gone on to  consider  the  claim
    outside the Rules and had therefore considered whether  the  impact  of
    removal was unjustifiably harsh for the Appellant and her husband.

22. I cannot accept that submission for two reasons.  First,  the  question
    whether  an  applicant  can  succeed  outside  the  Rules  incorporates
    consideration whether they can meet the Rules  and  if  not,  why  not.
    Whilst Mr Wilford was entitled to draw my  attention  to  [28]  of  the
    Decision  where  the  Judge  refers  to  the  Appellant's   overstaying
    (although possibly not on the right analysis for the reasons I set  out
    at [9] above), that does  not  fully  answer  the  point.   The  public
    interest in removal to which the Judge has regard  takes  into  account
    that the Appellant was here for at least some time unlawfully (although
    possibly less time than the Judge thought was the position).   However,
    it is not apparent that this is weighed in the balance to  the  correct
    threshold when considering the public interest.  There is no  reference
    to the maintenance of effective immigration control or, as Judge  Coker
    pointed out when granting permission, the relevance in that  regard  of
    the Appellant not meeting the Rules.

23. That brings me on to the second point which is that the Judge does  not
    consider whether the Appellant's husband could accompany the  Appellant
    to Turkey through the appropriate lens.  If the  Judge  had  considered
    paragraph EX.1.,  the  issue  whether  the  Appellant's  husband  could
    relocate would no doubt have occurred to him. As it  is,  there  is  an
    assumption in the Judge's findings at [26] to [30] of the Decision that
    the Appellant's husband would remain in the UK and the Appellant  would
    be separated from him (although there  is  some  contradiction  between
    what is said at [27] and [30] of the Decision in any event).  What  the
    Judge  does  not  do  though  is  provide  reasons  why  it  would   be
    unjustifiably harsh  for  the  Appellant's  husband  to  accompany  the
    Appellant to Turkey.

24. Mr Wilford said that the Appellant's  husband  could  not  relocate  to
    Turkey with the Appellant because he is in  full-time  employment  here
    and has lived here for 17 years.   However,  those  factors  could  not
    without  more  equate  to  insurmountable  obstacles  nor   indeed   to
    exceptional circumstances or unjustifiably harsh consequences. They are
    the commonplace impacts of removal on  a  British  citizen  or  settled
    partner and do not explain why that partner could not go to live in the
    country of which his/her partner is a national (particularly where,  as
    here, the British citizen  or  settled  partner  originates  from  that
    country).   There is in any event no reasoned finding by the  Judge  to
    that effect.  The Judge has therefore misdirected himself also on  this
    issue.

25. That failure impacts on the Judge's assessment read as  a  whole.   The
    Judge's  finding  that  removal  would  lead  to  unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences is not based only on the  continuing  IVF  treatment.   He
    accepts at [27] that the Appellant's case is not simply  based  on  the
    difficulties of relocating and continuing IVF in Turkey.  He accepts on
    the Appellant's evidence that IVF is available in Turkey.  That  factor
    is to be added to the Appellant's mental health issues.  Leaving  aside
    the adequacy or otherwise of Mr Mustafa's report in  this  regard  (and
    possible  connected  errors  or  discrepancies  in  relation   to   the
    background of this case in terms of risk on return), if, as  the  Judge
    says, those problems are caused in part by the stress of IVF treatment,
    then they will continue whether the Appellant is in the UK  or  Turkey.
    If they are due to the Appellant's immigration position, that  will  be
    resolved by this appeal.  If, as the Judge finds at [30], such problems
    are "exacerbated" by a return to Turkey without her husband, it follows
    that the Judge had to explain why it would be unjustifiably  harsh  for
    the Appellant's  husband to accompany  her or,  put  another  way,  why
    there would be insurmountable obstacles to  the  couple  relocating  to
    Turkey to continue their family life there.

26. Although, as Mr Wilford rightly pointed out, the assessment outside the
    Rules is a proportionality balance between the  interference  with  the
    Appellant's (and her husband's) family and private  lives  on  the  one
    hand and the public interest on the other, the burden  of  establishing
    the interference to be balanced in the equation falls on the Appellant.
     It is then for the Respondent to justify the  interference.   In  this
    case, it is difficult to see on the evidence what  it  was  by  way  of
    interference that the Judge has balanced in the equation  and,  in  any
    event, when assessing whether the interference was  outweighed  by  the
    public interest, the Judge has failed properly to take into account why
    the Appellant cannot meet the Rules and has failed properly  to  assess
    the situation on return to Turkey, in particular whether and if not why
    the Appellant's husband would or could accompany her.

27. It follows from that analysis that the error  in  failing  to  consider
    paragraph EX.1. is a material one.  The Decision is not rescued by  the
    Judge's analysis outside the Rules, predominantly because the Judge has
    failed  to  consider  the  position  outside  the  Rules  through   the
    appropriate lens and therefore has failed properly to analyse the wider
    position.  He has failed to explain why the Appellant's  husband  could
    not be expected to return to Turkey with her.  As such, he  has  failed
    properly to analyse and explain why the  consequences  of  removal  are
    unjustifiably harsh.

    NEXT STEPS

28. For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the  Decision.   Although  there
    may be a degree of fact finding needed when re-making the Decision, the
    facts of the case are not complex.  I do however consider it  necessary
    to hear evidence.  I understand why  the  Appellant  has  not  made  an
    application to adduce further evidence at this stage  as  she  was  the
    successful party in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I  would  however  be
    assisted by further evidence on the following matters:

       . Whether there has been any previous asylum  claim  or  whether  the
         Appellant says that there are any reasons why she fears  return  to
         Turkey.  I stress in that regard that, were  she  to  do  so,  this
         would amount to a new matter for which consent  would  be  required
         from the Respondent, but it would be helpful to be clear about  the
         basis on which she says she cannot return to Turkey. It would  also
         be helpful to have further details about any other reasons why  she
         needs to remain in the UK and her circumstances in Turkey.

       . It would equally be helpful to have  evidence  about  all  and  any
         reasons why the Appellant's  husband  is  unable  or  unwilling  to
         return to Turkey including evidence as  to  his  family  and  other
         circumstances in the UK and in Turkey.

       . I note that the couple were to undertake a  further  round  of  IVF
         starting in September 2019.  Updating evidence in that regard would
         be of assistance.  Similarly, it would be helpful to have  evidence
         as to the Appellant's mental health issues  from  an  appropriately
         qualified source and/or her medical records in that regard.

29. Mr Wilford asked that I preserve certain of the factual  findings  made
    by Judge Greasley.   Although  I  indicated  that  I  was  prepared  to
    preserve the finding in relation  to  the  Appellant  and  her  husband
    meeting the MIR, as Mr Kotas pointed out, I  will  have  to  reconsider
    this in any event as the issue must be considered at date  of  hearing.
    That may be particularly pertinent in  this  case  as  the  Appellant's
    husband has changed jobs on a number of occasions in recent years.  The
    Appellant will  therefore  need  to  ensure  that  evidence  about  his
    financial circumstances is updated if necessary.

30. Although I also indicated that I would  be  inclined  to  preserve  the
    finding that the Appellant can speak English, having reviewed  some  of
    the evidence to which I was not taken during the hearing, I do  not  do
    so.  Although I do not take into account that  the  Appellant  used  an
    interpreter for the hearing  (which  is  understandable  as  the  Judge
    found), there is other evidence in the Appellant's bundle  which  shows
    that, for example, she has used an interpreter for medical appointments
    and is said not to speak English.  I  will  therefore  reconsider  that
    issue afresh at the resumed hearing. I emphasise that I  will  take  no
    point about the use of an interpreter for the Appellant's  evidence  at
    the resumed hearing.  It is understandable that an appellant will  wish
    to give evidence in his/her mother tongue in the unfamiliar environment
    of a court room.  However, the  Appellant  may  wish  to  provide  some
    evidence of her English-speaking ability if she has  not  already  done
    so.

31. It is not appropriate to preserve any of the  other  findings  as  they
    form part of the assessment which I have found to  be  flawed  and,  as
    indicated above, I would be assisted  by  further  evidence  to  assist
    determination of the salient facts.




    CONCLUSION

32. For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that the Decision contains  a
    material error of  law.   I  set  aside  the  Decision.   I  have  made
    directions below for a resumed hearing.



DECISION

I am satisfied that the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Greasley
promulgated on 8 August 2019 discloses an error of law.  I  set  aside  that
decision.  I make the following directions for a resumed hearing:

      1. Within 28 days from the  date  when  this  decision  is  sent,  the
         Appellant shall file with the Tribunal and serve on the  Respondent
         any further evidence on which she wishes to rely.

      2. The resumed hearing is to  be  relisted  before  me  on  the  first
         available date after six weeks from the date when this decision  is
         sent with a time estimate of � day.  A Turkish interpreter is to be
         booked for the hearing unless the  Appellant  indicates  otherwise.
