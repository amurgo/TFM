Representation:

For the appellant:           Mr M. Iqbal, Counsel instructed by Addison &
Khan Solicitors
For the respondent:          Ms Z. Ahmed, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.     The  first  appellant  ("the   appellant")   appealed   against   the
    respondent's decision dated 24 September 2015 to refuse leave to remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant with the  second  appellant  (her
    husband) as her dependent. The respondent refused the application under
    the general grounds for refusal because it was alleged  that  she  used
    deception in the application for leave to remain because she produced a
    fraudulent English  language  certificate.  The  application  was  also
    refused under 'Attributes' because  the  Tier  4  sponsor  licence  was
    revoked and the  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for  Studies  (CAS)  was
    invalid.

2.    The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Her  appeal  was
    allowed but the Upper Tribunal subsequently set aside the decision in a
    decision promulgated on 03 July 2017 (annexed).

3.    The appeal was listed for a resumed hearing to remake the decision.  I
    heard evidence from the appellant and have considered  the  submissions
    made by both parties as well as the  documentary  evidence  before  the
    Upper Tribunal.

Decision and reasons

4.    The burden of proof is on the respondent to show  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the TOEIC English  language  certificate  issued  by
    Educational Testing Services (ETS) was obtained by fraud and  that  the
    appellant therefore used deception in  the  application  for  leave  to
    remain.

The respondent's evidence

5.    I have considered whether the evidence produced by the  respondent  is
    sufficient to discharge the initial evidential  burden  of  proof.  The
    appellant say that she took more than one  TOEIC  test.  The  one  that
    forms the basis of the decision  is  a  test  taken  on  17  July  2012
    (certificate no: 004420173403024). The respondent asserts that ETS  has
    a record of the speaking test. Using voice  verification  software  ETS
    confirmed that there was significant  evidence  to  conclude  that  the
    certificate was fraudulently obtained by the use of a proxy test taker.
    ETS declared the test taken on 17 July 2012 as "Invalid". ETS  declares
    a test as  "Invalid"  if  evidence  exists  of  proxy  test  taking  or
    impersonation. ETS declares  a  test  as  "Questionable"  if  there  is
    evidence  of  'administrative  irregularities',  but  not   necessarily
    evidence of fraud or deception: see R (Gazi) v  SSHD  (ETS  -  judicial
    review) IJR [2015] UKUT 327.

6.    The respondent has produced two copies of the  'Look-up  tool',  which
    is print out from a Home Office spreadsheet containing information from
    ETS and other information held by the Home Office: see MA (ETS -  TOEIC
    testing) [2016] UKUR 00450 [15(ii)]. At  the  last  hearing,  Mr  Iqbal
    pointed out discrepancies between the two print-outs, but  I  explained
    at [8-12] of the error of law decision why I  did  not  consider  those
    discrepancies affected the reliability of the information contained  in
    the 'Look-up tool' print-outs. The core details relating to the date of
    the test, the test centre, the score, the certificate  number  and  the
    invalidation of  the  test  are  consistent  in  both  print-outs.  The
    evidence is only produced  to  show  what  information  the  respondent
    received from ETS. The appellant does not dispute any of those details,
    save that she denies that deception was used, so it is unclear  how  or
    why Mr Iqbal considers the alleged discrepancies affect the reliability
    of the core piece of information  in  the  'Look-up  tool'  print-outs,
    which is that ETS cancelled the test as "Invalid".

7.    There is no direct information from ETS to show how  the  test  result
    in this case was assessed or why it was  then  cancelled  as  "Invalid"
    because of evidence of a proxy test taker.  The  respondent  relies  on
    'generic' evidence in the form of witness statements from  Home  Office
    officials, Rebecca Collings and Peter Millington, which were considered
    in some detail by the Tribunal in SM & Qadir (ETS - Evidence  -  Burden
    of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229. They outline general information  about  the
    investigation of widespread fraud following a Panorama programme  aired
    in February 2014.  Whilst  the  Tribunal  outlined  weaknesses  in  the
    evidence it concluded that the combination of evidence contained in the
    'Look-up tool' and the 'generic statements' was sufficient to discharge
    the initial evidential burden of proof [67-68]. The Court of Appeal  in
    SSHD v Shehzad & Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 found the rejection by a
    First-tier Tribunal of the same combination of evidence as insufficient
    to discharge the initial evidential burden  of  proof  amounted  to  an
    error of law [26].

8.    In light of those decisions I find that the  combination  of  the  ETS
    'Look-up tool' and the 'generic statements' is sufficient to shift  the
    burden of proof to the appellant to provide an innocent explanation  to
    the allegation. Before I move on to her evidence  it  is  necessary  to
    note that further evidence is produced by the respondent.

9.    The respondent has  produced  an  expert  report  by  Professor  Peter
    French dated 20  April  2016.  He  was  instructed  by  the  respondent
    following the  Tribunal's  decision  in  SM  &  Qadir.  The  report  is
    'generic' in  the  sense  that  it  does  not  deal  specifically  with
    information or analysis relating to this case. Professor French  is  an
    expert in forensic speech science. He was asked to given an opinion  on
    the reliability of the methodology used by ETS, and in particular,  the
    likelihood of false positives being reported on voice analysis of  test
    results. He considered the report produced by Dr  Harrison,  which  had
    been considered by the Tribunal in SM & Qadir. Much of  the  report  is
    quite technical, but Professor French concluded that the  methods  used
    would have resulted in substantially more false negative  results  than
    false positive results. It was not  possible  to  establish  a  closely
    specified percentage of false positives. He estimated that the rate  of
    false positive results was likely to be  "substantially  less  than  1%
    after the process of assessment by trained listeners had been applied".
     This  evidence  forms  part  of  a  body  of  evidence,  including  Dr
    Harrison's evidence as outlined in  SM  &  Qadir.  It  shows  that  the
    possibility of false positive results in assessing the use of  a  proxy
    test taker cannot be discounted.  The  number  of  false  positives  is
    difficult to assess, but it seems  likely  that  the  number  of  false
    positive results in the ETS assessment process is low.

10.   The respondent has also produced  evidence  relating  to  the  college
    where the appellant took the  TOEIC  test  (Premier  Language  Training
    Centre in Barking). A 'Look-up tool' print-out for 17 July 2012  states
    that a total of 182 test were taken at the centre on that day. The rest
    of the information is difficult to decipher. The information appears to
    suggest that 54 of the tests were deemed to be "Questionable"  and  128
    were deemed "Invalid" and that none were "Released". The average scores
    for speaking were 176.4 and writing 138.8. It is  unclear  whether  the
    information relates solely to results questioned by ETS  because  there
    is no information to suggest that any valid tests were taken that  day.
    Given the lack of clarity regarding this  information  I  find  that  I
    cannot place a great deal of weight on this print-out, taken alone, but
    in so far as it might suggest a high level of fraud and  administrative
    irregularities at that test centre it is consistent with other evidence
    produced by the respondent.

11.   The final piece of evidence relied upon by the respondent  is  a  Home
    Office report by Project Faï¿½ade, a criminal inquiry into abuse at TOEIC
    test centres. The report is dated 05 May 2015 and  relates  to  Premier
    Language Training Centre (PLTC) in Barking. The report states that  the
    criminal inquiry at PLTC revealed that between 20  March  2012  and  05
    February 2014 PLTC undertook 5055 TOEIC speaking and writing  tests  of
    which ETS identified 3780 as "Invalid", 1275 as "Questionable"  and  no
    tests were "Not withdrawn" i.e. there was no  evidence  of  invalidity.
    This information appears to show that ETS  withdrew  all  test  results
    taken in  that  period  as  either  "Invalid"  or  "Questionable".  The
    percentage of  test  results  that  were  deemed  "Invalid"  indicating
    evidence of fraud was 75%. The test taken by the appellant on  17  July
    2012 fell within that period. Her test result formed part of the 75% of
    tests that were deemed "Invalid" due to evidence of fraud.

12.   The report goes on to state that ETS carried out an  audit  inspection
    on 18 September 2013 in which a test centre  employee  is  reported  to
    have admitted that cheating took place.  Documents  relating  to  TOEIC
    exams were discovered during a search on 16  June  2014,  which  listed
    tests taken between 19 November 2013 and 05  February  2014  that  were
    suspected to be fraudulent. Alongside the names of the candidates  were
    the names of "pilots" (imposters) who sat the test  on  behalf  of  the
    candidates. The documents also appeared to disclose the names of people
    who they suspected acted as middle men in the  deception.  Analysis  of
    telecom devices seized from test centre employees revealed numerous SMS
    messages discussing the use of "pilots". Voice  analysis  was  said  to
    show evidence of  widespread  cheating.  While  some  of  the  evidence
    related to tests taken outside the period when the appellant  took  her
    test, overall, the evidence provides a damning picture of a  widespread
    and deliberate use of fraud at the test centre.

The appellant's evidence

13.   The appellant did not give evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    but decided to give  evidence  at  the  resumed  hearing.  Her  witness
    statement provided a brief response to  the  allegations  made  by  the
    respondent. She denied cheating on  the  test  and  asserted  that  the
    respondent had failed to produce any direct evidence to show  that  she
    used a fraudulent certificate. She asserted that her photograph was  on
    the test certificate, which indicated  that  she  took  the  test.  She
    stated that she had achieved 7.5 for speaking in a previous IELTS  test
    taken on 26 May 2012. The appellant asserted that this showed that  she
    did not need to use a proxy test taker.

14.   At the hearing the appellant was quite open in admitting that she  did
    not achieved the scores she required in the previous IELTS  test  taken
    on 24 May 2012 or in the first TOEIC test that she took at PLTC  on  19
    June 2012. Although she is correct to say that her speaking  score  for
    the IELTS test was 7.5, which was by far her highest score of the  four
    elements of the test, the  rest  of  the  scores  were  inadequate  and
    resulted in an overall band score of 5.0. The appellant  only  achieved
    4.5 for 'Listening', 3.0 for 'Reading' and 5.6 for 'Writing'. To  apply
    for an extension of leave to remain as a Tier 4 student she required  a
    score at level B2 CEFR. An overall band score of 5.0 fell short of  the
    5.5 band score she needed.

15.   The appellant said that she went to PLTC  in  order  to  take  another
    test to try to improve her score. The reason why she chose that college
    was because she was living near  to  the  test  centre,  so  it  was  a
    convenient place to take the test. The appellant  sought  to  introduce
    evidence to show that she was living at  an  address  in  Strone  Road,
    London E7. However, the payslip is dated July 2013 so it does not cover
    the period when she claims to have taken the tests at PLTC in  2012.  A
    document from HMRC relating to her National Insurance  number  provides
    the same address, but is equally unhelpful because it is undated.

16.   The appellant claimed that she was living at this address at the  date
    when she took the TOEIC tests at PLTC in  June  and  July  2012.  Other
    evidence shows that she was likely to be living at that address in July
    2013. However, when she made  the  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain in September 2012 she gave her "current address in  the  UK"  at
    B16 of the  application  form  as  an  address  in  Station  Parade  in
    Northolt, Middlesex. At the hearing the  appellant  sought  to  explain
    this apparent discrepancy. She said it was the address of her husband's
    cousin. She said that  her  husband  was  living  with  his  cousin  in
    Northolt, but she was living in shared accommodation nearer to college.
    She thought it would be better to give the address in Northolt so  that
    any post was not misplaced. When pressed as to why she  claimed  to  be
    living apart from her husband at the time the appellant said  that  her
    college was near to the address in Strone Road and her  husband  wanted
    to spend time with his cousin. He was  working  with  his  cousin.  The
    appellant said that she attended Infonexus College  in  Ilford  at  the
    time.

17.   On the face of it there is nothing inherently  implausible  about  the
    appellant's explanation that she chose an English language test  centre
    because it was conveniently close to where she was living. However, the
    appellant has failed to produce any  evidence  to  show  that  she  was
    living in Strone Road at the time and it  seems  implausible  that  the
    appellant would go to the expense of renting a room in a shared  house,
    and would live separately from her husband, just to save some  time  on
    travel to college in Ilford. I found the appellant's  explanation  weak
    and unpersuasive.

18.   There is evidence of two tests recorded  at  PLTC  in  June  and  July
    2012. The first test was on 19 June 2012. The certificate for the TOEIC
    speaking and writing test includes a photograph of  the  appellant  and
    states that she achieved a score of 140  for  'Speaking'  and  150  for
    'Writing'. Although the 'Writing' score was sufficient to  reach  level
    B2 CEFR the 'Speaking' score was not. There is no evidence to show what
    the test results were for the 'Listening' and 'Reading' aspects of  the
    test taken on 19 June 2012. The appellant claims that she was suffering
    from hayfever that day, which is why she did not  do  so  well  in  the
    'Speaking' test. That test result was  deemed  "Questionable"  by  ETS,
    which accordingly to their general categorisation,  suggests  that  ETS
    thought there was some evidence of irregularity, but not necessarily of
    fraud. An applicant would normally be asked to sit the  test  again  in
    such circumstances. For the purpose of this appeal I  do  not  need  to
    determine whether it was properly deemed as "Questionable" because  the
    test result the respondent relies upon is the  one  taken  on  17  July
    2012.

19.   The certificate for the second TOEIC test taken on 17 July  2012  also
    includes a photograph of the appellant. The appellant is  different  in
    appearance, which suggests that it was taken on a different day to  the
    first. The test certificate states that she obtained a score of 170 for
    'Speaking', which is the minimum score required  to  achieve  level  B2
    CEFR. The CAS outlines the other score results. She  obtained  150  for
    'Writing', the same as before. Overall, the scores were  sufficient  to
    meet the level required to apply for an extension of leave to remain as
    a Tier 4 Migrant.

20.   The appellant argues that  the  fact  that  she  is  pictured  on  the
    certificates is evidence to show that she took  the  test.  However,  I
    find that this argument is neutral because it is  apparent  that  every
    test certificate requires a photograph of the person who it is  claimed
    took the test. If a test certificate is obtained  by  use  of  fraud  a
    photograph of the person would have to be included in  the  certificate
    whether it was genuine or not. If an  applicant  is  complicit  in  the
    fraud they would still need to have  their  photograph  taken  for  the
    certificate. Although the photographs indicate that the  appellant  had
    her photograph taken on both occasions, the fact that  she  might  have
    gone to the test centre to have a photograph taken does not  assist  in
    rebutting the central allegation that a proxy test taker was used.

21.   The appellant also argues that it does not make sense that  she  would
    fail the first TOEIC test if she was using a proxy  test  taker.  There
    would be no sense in her paying someone to fix the test if it  did  not
    achieve the result that  she  needed.  There  is  some  force  in  this
    argument, but it requires further analysis in the context of the  other
    evidence.

22.   The respondent does not allege that fraud was used in the first  TOEIC
    test taken in  June  2012.  The  test  result  was  only  cancelled  as
    "Questionable". It is the second test  that  forms  the  basis  of  the
    fraud/deception allegation. At that stage the appellant clearly  had  a
    motive to achieve the required test result. She had fallen short of the
    scores she needed in the IELTS test in May 2012. If the appellant  took
    the first TOEIC test in June 2012 as she claims, she failed to obtained
    the scores needed to apply for further leave to remain. At  that  point
    she had contact with a test centre where there is evidence to  indicate
    that widespread fraud took place. All the scores in the period in which
    the appellant took the test were cancelled by ETS as "Questionable"  or
    "Invalid". It is reported  that  at  least  one  test  centre  employee
    admitted that fraud took place at the centre. Other evidence seized  by
    the police also indicated that "pilots"  were  used  in  tests  at  the
    centre. It is plausible that the appellant might have taken  the  first
    TOEIC test, but after having failed to achieve the  score  she  needed,
    then employed the use of a proxy test taker. It is plausible that staff
    at the centre might have offered to assist her given the extent of  the
    criminal enterprise taking place at the  test  centre.  In  short,  the
    appellant had every motive to use fraud in the second TOEIC test having
    failed to achieve the score she needed in the two previous tests.

23.   I have had the opportunity of assessing the appellant as a witness.  I
    was asked to take into account the fact that she gave her  evidence  in
    English and therefore didn't need to use a proxy to take the test.  All
    I can note is that the appellant was largely  able  to  understand  and
    answer questions in English,  although  at  times  she  was  unable  to
    express herself  fluently.  She  came  across  as  someone  who  has  a
    relatively good standard of conversational English,  but  who  was  not
    always able to express herself in a grammatically correct way.  English
    is clearly her second language. Although she can communicate in English
    I am unable to place much weight on this issue one  way  or  the  other
    because I am not qualified to assess whether her standard of English is
    sufficient to meet the level that was required.

24.   Although the appellant was fairly open regarding  certain  aspects  of
    her evidence, such as admitting  that  the  previous  scores  were  not
    sufficient, those were points that were easily verifiable and could not
    be denied. Her account of why she chose to live at a different  address
    to her husband was vague and unpersuasive. Although she  provided  some
    detail about the registration process for the test,  those  details  do
    not assist me in assessing her overall credibility. It is obvious  that
    a person would need to provide a passport and pay a fee to book a test.
    The appellant had already been through a similar process when she  took
    the IELTS test. When she was asked to describe  the  process  when  she
    took the 'Speaking' test the appellant's evidence was  somewhat  vague.
    She said that the test took 20 minutes and she was asked 11  questions.
    She said that the questions were on a  computer  and  that  she  had  a
    "phone" (indicating an earphone). She told me  that  "you  have  a  few
    seconds to prepare speaking  test.  20  seconds  or  30  seconds.  They
    recorded it". She couldn't  remember  any  of  the  questions.  Despite
    efforts to  obtain  a  little  more  detail  the  appellant's  evidence
    remained vague.

Conclusion

25.   In weighing up the evidence I have taken into account the  fact  that,
    aside from the record that ETS  has  recorded  the  second  TOEIC  test
    result as "Invalid" due to evidence of a proxy test taker, there is  no
    direct evidence from ETS to show how or why the  company  came  to  the
    conclusion that this particular appellant obtained  a  fraudulent  test
    certificate.  The  evidence  produced  by  the  respondent  is  largely
    circumstantial or generic in nature. However, it seems clear  that  ETS
    has carried out an investigation into a large number of  test  results,
    which includes assessment of recordings of the speaking tests, in which
    proxy test takers were found to have been used. Although  the  evidence
    relating to the reliability of the ETS process is difficult  to  assess
    with any accuracy, expert evidence suggests that the  likelihood  of  a
    'false positive' result arising from the ETS process of verification is
    low. The categorisation of the second test result taken on 17 July 2012
    as "Invalid" suggests that ETS considered that there  was  evidence  of
    fraud or deception involved in the test as opposed to a  categorisation
    of "Questionable", which only  suggests  administrative  irregularities
    were identified. Evidence from the police investigation  indicates  the
    likelihood of a massive scale of fraud at PLTC. The fact  that  all  of
    the 5055 tests taken at PLTC in the relevant period were  cancelled  as
    "Invalid" or "Questionable" indicates to a high  degree  of  likelihood
    that fraud was used in a large number of cases.

26.    While  the  appellant  has  been  able  to  provide  some   plausible
    explanations to the allegations, on the whole, I  found  her  to  be  a
    vague and unimpressive witness. Her explanation about her  address  was
    implausible and was used to explain why she might  take  a  test  at  a
    centre that was quite far away from her registered address in Northolt.
    Although she might have lived at an address  in  Strone  Road  at  some
    point, there is no evidence to show that she lived at that  address  in
    June and July 2012. I accept that it seems unlikely that the  appellant
    would pay a proxy test taker to cheat on the test  if  the  result  was
    inadequate. As such, it seems likely  that  the  appellant  might  have
    taken the first TOEIC test in June 2012. The test result was deemed  as
    "Questionable",  but  there  is  no   evidence   to   show   what   the
    administrative irregularities were that underpin  the  ETS  assessment.
    Even if the appellant took the test in June 2012 she had dealings  with
    a test centre where there  is  evidence  of  widespread  fraud.  Having
    failed to achieve the result she needed on two tests taken in  May  and
    June 2012 the appellant had every motive to seek to improve her  score.
    Having heard evidence from the appellant I did not find  her  to  be  a
    persuasive witness.  I  am  not  satisfied  that  she  has  provided  a
    sufficiently credible explanation in response to the allegation.

27.   Although the respondent's evidence falls far short of  being  able  to
    say with any certainty that the appellant cheated by using a proxy test
    taker, or indeed any other method of fraud, I am  not  required  to  be
    certain. The respondent  only  needs  to  produce  sufficiently  cogent
    evidence to show that it is more likely than  not  that  the  appellant
    relied on a fraudulent certificate. After having weighed  the  evidence
    produced by both  parties  I  am  satisfied  that  the  respondent  has
    discharged the  legal  burden  of  proof  to  justify  refusal  of  the
    application under paragraph 322(1A) of the immigration rules.

28.   Mr Iqbal accepted that the '60 day'  issue  regarding  the  CAS  would
    fall away if the respondent made out the allegation of  deception.  The
    application would have been refused whether or not  the  applicant  was
    given an opportunity to find another Tier 4 sponsor.

29.   It follows that the second appellant's appeal also  fails  because  he
    is dependent on the first appellant's application. The refusal of leave
    to remain focussed solely on the application under  Tier  4.  No  human
    rights issues were considered by the respondent or  raised  during  the
    appeal.

DECISION

The appeal is dismissed under the immigration rules

Officer
For the respondent:          Mr M. Iqbal, Counsel instructed by Addison &
Khan Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    For the sake of continuity I will refer to the parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal although technically  the  Secretary  of
    State is the appellant in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

2.     The  first  appellant  ("the   appellant")   appealed   against   the
    respondent's decision dated 24 September 2015 to refuse leave to remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  with  her  husband,  the  second
    appellant, as her dependent.  The  initial  application  for  leave  to
    remain was made on 27 September 2012. It is unclear why it took so long
    to make a decision. The Secretary  of  State  refused  the  application
    under the general grounds of refusal contained in the immigration rules
    (paragraph 322(1A)) asserting that a false document  was  submitted  in
    support of the  application.  The  allegation  related  to  an  English
    language test certificate issued by ETS.  The  respondent  stated  that
    following an  investigation  ETS  cancelled  the  test  certificate  as
    "invalid" because there was thought  to  be  "significant  evidence  to
    conclude that your certificate was fraudulently obtained by the use  of
    a proxy test taker".

3.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell ("the judge")  allowed  the  appeal
    in a decision promulgated on 14 November  2016.  The  judge  noted  the
    evidence produced by the respondent in support of the allegation.  This
    included  the  generic  statements  of  Rebecca  Collings   and   Peter
    Millington, a copy of a forensic  speaker  comparison  test  report  by
    Professor Peter French and a Home Office  Report  on  "Project  Faï¿½ade"
    relating to Premier Language Training Centre in  Barking  [5].  He  was
    also given copies of the decisions in SM and Qadir (ETS  -  evidence  -
    burden of proof) [2016] UKUT 229 and Shehzad & Chowdhury v SSHD  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 615 [6]. The judge went on to summarise the  submissions  made
    by both parties, including points made by Mr Iqbal relating to apparent
    inconsistencies  between  two  different  'Look  Up  Tool'  print  outs
    produced by the respondent [17 & 19]. He  then  went  on  to  correctly
    summarise the burden and standard of proof and was clearly aware of the
    shifting evidential burdens that might occur [22 & 25].  The  substance
    of the judge's findings is found in paragraphs 24-29 of the decision:

            "24. Looking very carefully at the case guidance which  as  been
           put before me, including the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in
           SM and Qadir (above) I am of the view that here  the  Respondent
           seeks  to  rely  virtually  wholly  upon  the  generic  evidence
           presented and  upon  an  assessment  made  in  relation  to  the
           validity of the English language test. The statements  presented
           on behalf of the Respondent, in the  Respondent's  supplementary
           bundle, set out the generic evidence. Indeed,  a  photograph  of
           the First Appellant appears on the test certificate and  it  was
           not claimed that the First Appellant had not  attended  for  the
           interview.

            25. In relation to the burden of proof, matters are  indeed  set
           out by the Upper Tribunal in Muhandiramge [2015] UKUT 675 (IAC),
           particularly wherein the earlier Upper Tribunal decision in Shen
           [2014] UKUT 236 (IAC) is referred to  at  paragraph  10  of  the
           decision. That relates to the interchange as to  the  burden  of
           proof between the parties. It is  described  as  an  "evidential
           pendulum" in Shen (above).

            26. Here  the  Respondent  asserts  that  there  are  sufficient
           reasons presented within the generic evidence and  by  reference
           to a "look up tool" to state that there has been  an  assessment
           which touches directly on  the  test  undertaken  by  the  First
           Appellant, the consequences of which indicate  that  there  were
           sufficient  concerns  to  discharge  the  burden  that  in   all
           likelihood the  test  taken  by  the  First  Appellant  was  not
           properly undertaken. Specifically it is  alleged  that  a  proxy
           took the test.

            27. Whilst the First Appellant did not  give  evidence,  I  have
           taken into account what is  stated  in  her  witness  statement,
           although her evidence of course was not tested. The  reality  is
           that she says that she attended the test, there is a  photograph
           of her which appears (which the system appeared to require to be
           undertaken at the relevant test centre) and  there  is  no  more
           specific  of  direct  allegation  against  the  First  Appellant
           herself.

            Conclusions

             28.  Ultimately  in  relation  to  the  Respondent's   decision
           concerning the First Appellant the burden of proof needed to  be
           discharged by the Respondent and I do not find in the particular
           circumstances that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  beyond  the
           generic  evidence  to  discharge  the  Respondent's  burden   by
           reference to the generic witness statements or to the ETS  "look
           up tool". I  find,  as  was  asserted  by  Mr  Iqbal,  that  the
           assessment by the Respondent, with the printout at  page  F1  to
           the Respondent's  bundle,  is  insufficient  by  way  of  direct
           evidence  concerning  the  alleged  demeanours  of   the   First
           Appellant in the test process.

            29. In relation to the First Appellant I therefore do  not  find
           that the Respondent has  discharged  the  burden  overall  which
           rested on her in relation to the allegations  made  against  the
           First  Appellant  with  respect  to  the  processes  which   she
           undertook in relation to the testing of  her  abilities  in  the
           English language. That being so, I do not find that the  refusal
           decision was appropriate. Instead, upon the  Respondent  finding
           that the institutional sponsor was not longer  registered  as  a
           Tier 4 sponsor, the Respondent should  have  allowed  the  First
           Appellant a further 60 day period in order to attempt to  obtain
           a new Tier 4 sponsor and an opportunity to elicit a new CAS."

4.    The Secretary  of  State  seeks  to  appeal  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision on the following grounds:

      (i)   The First-tier Tribunal failed to  have  proper  regard  to  the
           decision in Shehzad, where the Court of Appeal made  clear  that
           the  combination  of  the  generic  witness  statements,  albeit
           criticised in SM & Qadir, and a 'Look Up  Tool'  print  out  was
           sufficient to meet the initial evidential burden  of  proof.  In
           that  case  the  Tribunal's  rejection  of   the   evidence   as
           insufficient to shift the evidential burden amounted to an error
           of law.

      (ii)  The respondent asserts that the initial  evidential  burden  was
           made out and it fell to  the  appellant  to  offer  an  innocent
           explanation  in  response.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
           apparently accepting the appellant's evidence that she  attended
           the test when she chose not give evidence and  in  circumstances
           where her credibility had been called into question.

Decision and reasons

5.    After having considered the arguments put forward by  both  parties  I
    am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved the  making
    of an error on a point of law.

6.    Although it is clear that the judge was aware of  the  relevant  legal
    principles relating to the  burden  and  standard  of  proof  in  cases
    involving allegations of deception [22  &  25]  the  substance  of  the
    decision in paragraphs 22-27 set out the evidence  without  making  any
    clear findings as to what weight he placed on the evidence and why. The
    judge referred to SM & Qadir [24], but did not  say  how  the  decision
    impacted on his findings.  In that case the Tribunal concluded that the
    combination of the Look Up Tool and the generic evidence,  despite  its
    weaknesses, was sufficient to shift the evidential burden of  proof  to
    the appellant to provide an innocent explanation. The Court  of  Appeal
    in Shehzad came to a similar conclusion.

7.    Mr Iqbal's submissions  said  little  in  defence  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision, but instead repeated the substantive submissions  he
    made before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  He  asserted  that  there  were
    discrepancies between the two Look Up Tool print outs provided  by  the
    respondent, which reduced  the  weight  that  could  be  given  to  the
    evidence.

8.    I find that the points raised about the Look Up Tool  print  outs  are
    not as significant as he asserts. He does not suggest any  cynicism  in
    the presentation of the evidence, but asserts  that  it  is  unreliable
    because there are slightly different details recorded  on  the  initial
    Look Up Tool print out contained in the  respondent's  bundle  and  the
    subsequent print out produced as an attachment  to  Hilary  Rackstraw's
    statement at the hearing.

9.    The first thing to note is that counsel for the Secretary of State  in
    Shehzad accepted  that  the  presentation  of  evidence  from  ETS  was
    developed over time [30]. The initial refusal  decision  in  this  case
    dates back to September 2015. The Look Up Tool print out  contained  in
    the respondent's bundle is consistent with the format seen in a  number
    of earlier cases involving ETS deception allegations.  It  seems  quite
    clear from the up to date statement prepared by Hilary Rackshaw, a Home
    Office employee, on 14 October 2016, that she  sought  to  introduce  a
    copy of the latest database print out. The fact that the two print outs
    do not have a similar format, in  itself,  is  insufficient  reason  to
    doubt the reliability of the information that they purport to  present.



10.   Mr Iqbal made much of the fact that the record  numbers  contained  in
    the first print out were not the same as those in the second. There  is
    no evidence to show how or why that might be. If the database has  been
    developed over time it is certainly possible that some  record  numbers
    might have changed. I cannot see how this might be material to the core
    issue that the evidence seeks to present, which is the  fact  that  ETS
    cancelled the appellant's speaking test  result  as  'invalid'  because
    there was evidence to show that she had used a proxy test taker.

11.   Mr Iqbal also sought to highlight the fact that the most recent  print
    out included reference to the appellant's previous and current passport
    numbers. He questioned how  ETS  could  obtain  her  previous  passport
    number. There is no discrepancy between the  two  records.  This  issue
    also seems immaterial to the core information that the documents  seeks
    to present. The original Look Up Tool print out, although difficult  to
    read due to the tiny font, clearly did include both passport references
    and this is consistent on both records.

12.   Aside from  the  record  numbers,  the  purpose  of  which  is  simply
    unknown, both print outs contain  exactly  the  same  core  data.  Both
    records  state  the  data  source  from  the  Home  Office  "CID"  case
    information database. The material information relating to the relevant
    issue that  the  evidence  seeks  to  present,  which  is  whether  ETS
    cancelled the test result as 'invalid', is consistent in both  records.
    The certificate number is the same, the appellant's name,  nationality,
    date of birth, the test date, the test centre, the scores and the  "ETS
    Batch date". In short, there are no material discrepancies in the  data
    presented albeit that the most up to date Look Up Tool is  printed  out
    in a slightly different format.

13.   Returning to the First-tier Tribunal decision,  the  judge's  findings
    are limited to paragraphs 28-29. Despite having been  referred  to  the
    decisions  in  SM  &  Qadir  and  Shehzad  the  judge  found  that  the
    combination of the Look Up Tool and 'generic evidence' was insufficient
    to discharge the burden of proof. He said that the first Look  Up  Tool
    print out was "insufficient by way of direct evidence". In doing so  he
    failed to explain why he was departing from the clear findings made  in
    the SM & Qadir and Shehzad. Nor did the judge explain  why  the  points
    made by Mr Iqbal undermined the Look Up Tool evidence.

14.   The evidence produced by the respondent was not limited  to  the  Look
    Up Tool and generic witness statements of Rebecca  Collings  and  Peter
    Millington, which were the focus of the decisions in  SM  &  Qadir  and
    Shehzad. The respondent produced other evidence,  albeit  not  directly
    relating to the appellant, which was relevant to  the  likelihood  that
    she might have used deception in the test.

15.   The up to date Look  Up  Tool  information  now  included  information
    relating to  test  results  from  particular  colleges.  The  appellant
    claimed to have taken the speaking test at  Premier  Language  Training
    Centre in Barking on 17 July 2012. The data relating to tests taken  at
    the Premier Language Training Centre on 17 July 2012 indicated that 70%
    of the tests taken on that day had been marked by ETS as  'invalid'.  A
    report from the criminal investigation  into  the  college  by  Project
    Faï¿½ade dated 05 May 2015 set out further data. In the  period  from  20
    March 2012 and 05 February 2014, which included the date the  appellant
    says she took the test, Premier Language Training Centre undertook 5055
    TOEIC speaking and writing  tests  of  which  ETS  identified  3780  as
    'invalid' and 1275 as 'questionable'. 75% of tests taken at the  centre
    during that period were called into question. Project Faï¿½ade  concluded
    that there was evidence to show "organised and widespread" abuse at the
    test centre. The respondent also produced  a  copy  of  a  report  from
    Professor Peter French, who is an expert in forensic speech science.

16.   This evidence formed no part of the judge's findings  albeit  that  it
    was  material  to  an  overall  assessment  of  the  strength  of   the
    respondent's evidence. The fact that there was evidence  of  widespread
    fraud at the particular test centre where the appellant says  she  took
    the test was relevant to  the  allegation  made  in  relation  to  this
    particular appellant.

17.   Although the judge was clearly aware of the shifting burden  of  proof
    it is not clear from the findings made  in  paragraph  28  whether  the
    judge found the respondent's evidence was  insufficient  to  shift  the
    evidential burden or whether he was referring to the overall burden. If
    the combination of the Look Up Tool and generic evidence is  likely  to
    shift the evidential burden as found by the Tribunal and the  Court  of
    Appeal, the judge then failed to make any clear findings as to  whether
    the appellant produced sufficient evidence in rebuttal.

18.   The judge did not hear  evidence  from  the  appellant.  The  evidence
    given in her witness statement was fairly limited. The  judge  made  no
    clear finding to explain why the fact that  the  certificate  contained
    the appellant's  photograph,  as  most  English  language  certificates
    normally do, might rebut the allegation that  she  used  a  proxy  test
    taker.

19.   After having considered the First-tier Tribunal  decision  in  detail,
    as well as the arguments put forward by both parties, I  conclude  that
    the First-tier Tribunal decision failed to take into  account  relevant
    case law from the Upper Tribunal and the Court  of  Appeal,  failed  to
    make findings in relation to material  evidence,  and  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons to explain the conclusions in paragraphs 28-29.  Given
    that the subsequent finding relating to the 60-day policy  issue  could
    only succeed if the respondent failed to show deception in relation  to
    the ETS issue, that finding must also be set aside.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law

The decision is set aside

The appeal will be relisted for a resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal


DIRECTIONS

1.    The appellant shall inform the Upper Tribunal by Friday 14  July  2017
    at the latest whether any witnesses will be called to give evidence  at
    the resumed hearing and whether an interpreter is needed.

2.    Any up to date evidence relied upon by either party, including  up  to
    date witness statements, should be served no later than 7  days  before
    the resumed hearing.
