Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Igulot (sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are citizens of Uganda born on 9 June, 1984, 9
      February, 2007 and 26 May, 2011 respectively. They are represented by
      the sponsor who is the husband of the first named appellant. The
      second and third appellants are their children.

   2. The sponsor is studying in the United Kingdom  with  leave  to  remain
      under Tier 4 until 30  November,  2019.  The  applications  for  entry
      clearance were refused on maintenance grounds and  because  the  birth
      certificates provided were not contemporaneous and not  original.  The
      Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied about  the  relationship  of
      the appellants to the sponsor.

   3. The appellants appealed against the decision and their appeals came
      before a First-tier Judge on 6 March, 2013. The judge resolved in the
      appellants' favour the issue of the birth certificates and there has
      been no challenge to that decision. He found that the passports were
      obtained in order to facilitate the children's travel.

   4. In  relation  to  the  maintenance  issue  the  sponsor  provided  the
      respondent's policy guidance applicable where there was an established
      presence by a student in inner London. The guidance  illustrated  that
      for a student making an application for a spouse and two children they
      must show �600 for the spouse and �600 for each  child  together  with
      �1000 for themselves making a total of �2800 per month.  This  had  to
      continue for two months making a  total  of  �5600.  On  the  evidence
      before the judge  the  judge  found  there  was  a  shortfall  as  the
      sponsor's bank account only showed that �5403.21 was available  during
      the relevant period. Accordingly the judge dismissed the appeals.

   5. Permission to appeal was granted on 15 May, 2013. It was noted that it
      had been argued that under the guidance the maintenance sum  of  �1000
      for the sponsor was not required and the  total  funds  required  were
      �3600 and not �5600 as the judge had found.

   6. Mr Deller acknowledged that the guidance and the rules  were  "not  in
      harmony" but it did appear clear that in so far  as  the  sponsor  was
      concerned it was not required  for  him  to  show  that  he  could  be
      maintained in a situation like this where he  was  not  an  applicant.
      This was the position under  Appendix  E  as  well  as  the  guidance.
      Accordingly the judge had been in error to include the  �1000  in  his
      calculations. Taking the guidance and  the  rules  together  the  sums
      required were �600 per month for each appellant for two months  making
      a total of �3600. In so far as the guidance was wider than  the  rules
      the appeal would be allowed as the respondent's decision  was  not  in
      accordance with the law.

   7. In the refusal a point had been taken on the Bank Statements  provided
      which the First-tier Judge had not specifically dealt with.

   8. The sponsor said there was only one issue and he submitted the  First-
      tier Judge had  misunderstood  the  policy.  He  had  given  the  Bank
      Statements to the First-tier Judge and the judge had raised  no  issue
      with them.

   9. Mr Deller acknowledged that what the sponsor said was  plausible.  The
      evidence related to the position as at the date of decision. There had
      been no Presenting Officer before the First-tier Judge.

  10. Mr Deller acknowledged that he  was  in  difficulties  given  that  no
      response had been filed in this matter.

  11. The appellant had registered for his course of study on 26th September
      2011, 8 months prior to the appellant's entry clearance  applications.
      The judge appears to have accepted that the sponsor had an established
      presence in the United Kingdom and quoted the figures  for  dependants
      where the student was in central London.

  12. It does appear that had the judge appreciated  that  the  calculations
      only had to cover the appellants and not the sponsor himself he  would
      have allowed the appeal. The sponsor was not  applying  for  an  entry
      clearance together with the appellants. He had entry clearance and was
      in the United Kingdom and the family was to join him.

  13. Given that the judge would have allowed the appeal but for this  error
      and in the absence of a response from the respondent seeking to uphold
      the decision for another reason I am satisfied that it would be  right
      to remake the decision.

      These appeals are allowed.
