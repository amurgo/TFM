                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hussain, promulgated on 29th April 2015, following a  hearing  at
    Richmond on 23rd March 2015.  In the determination, the judge dismissed
    the appeal of Ping Sui, who subsequently applied for, and was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of China who was born on 27th January
    1949.  She arrived in the UK on 1st October 2013 on a  visa  issued  on
    16th September 2013 which expired on 16th March  2014.   On  5th  March
    2014, the Appellant applied  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain.   That
    application was refused on 29th July 2014 and is the subject matter  of
    this appeal.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that  she  is  dependent  upon  her  daughter,
    Vivian Sui, a British citizen, who came to the  UK  in  2002,  and  who
    works as a station manager assistant at China Eastern Airlines, and has
    a British citizen son.  Vivian Sui is the only child of her parents and
    since the death of her father, in 2001, she has been living alone.  The
    Appellant's claim is  that  she  has  been  visiting  her  daughter  on
    numerous occasions, but her health is now deteriorating and  she  needs
    her daughter to help her with day to day living.  She cannot live alone
    because she has cervical and lumbar spondylosis and is  suffering  from
    depression.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that the Appellant could not have  been  in  receipt  of
    financial assistance from her daughter, Vivian Sui, in the UK,  because
    her earnings were such, that with a modest income of some ï¿½22,500,  she
    would need this amount to herself manage economically in this  country.
    The judge considered whether it would be proportionate to  exclude  the
    Appellant from the United Kingdom (paragraph 35).

 5. There was medical evidence that the Appellant suffered  from  ischaemic
    heart disease and degenerative bone disease, but,

         "There is nothing in  the  evidence  to  show  that  the  Appellant
         requires at the present time any assistance with her personal  care
         such a bathing,  going  to  the  toilet,  walking  etc.   What  the
         evidence  shows  is  that  the  Appellant  suffers   from   medical
         conditions which are gradually  going  to  deteriorate  from  which
         there is no cure" (paragraph 36).

 6. The judge went on to hold that whilst the Appellant's daughter  clearly
    wanted to support her mother, both practically as well as  emotionally,
    what Vivian Sui really wanted was for her mother here  "to  assist  her
    with childcare" because both  "reluctantly  admitted  that  the  mother
    played a role in the care of the Sponsor's child" (paragraph 38).

 7. The judge went on to say that family life obviously existed between the
    Appellant and her daughter and that "she has  been  part  of  the  same
    household since arrival in this country  in  October  2013"  (paragraph
    39).

 8. The judge considered the position in the round and concluded that  this
    did  "not  present  any  exceptional  features"  (paragraph  40).   The
    application was then rejected under Article 8 grounds,  having  earlier
    been rejected under the Immigration Rules.

 9. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

10.  The  grounds  of  application  state  that  at  paragraph  33  of  the
    determination, Judge Hussain had held that "there  was  no  Immigration
    Rule that catered for her situation", and then  proceeded  to  consider
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.  However, this was problematic
    because Article 8 claims are  now  considered  within  the  Immigration
    Rules, only if the Article 8 claim within the Rules fails does one need
    to go on to consider Article 8 outside the Rules.  The entire  approach
    of the judge, accordingly, had been on a wrongful basis.

11. On 10th August 2015, permission to appeal was granted by  the  Tribunal
    on the basis that the judge had approached the matter wrongly  and  had
    also failed  to  consider  the  public  interest  considerations  under
    Section 117 in the appropriate manner because  this  provision  is  not
    exhaustive in terms of the factors that can be taken into account.

12. On 24th August 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect  that
    the Appellant arrived in the UK most recently in 2013 and whilst it  is
    the case that she has made numerous visits to the UK, it  is  difficult
    to see how this evidence could support a contention that she  had  lost
    all ties with China.  The judge had taken into account  the  fact  that
    Section 117 could not come to the assistance of the Appellant.

The Hearing

13. At the hearing before me on 27th November 2015,  Ms  Daykin,  submitted
    that the judge fell into the following errors.  First,  he  stated  (at
    paragraph 33) that there was no  Immigration  Rule  applicable  to  the
    Appellant's  situation  and  that,  "as  a   result   the   Appellant's
    application should have been considered outside the Immigration  Rules"
    and added that, "that  consideration  should  have  taken  place  under
    Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention".  This  was  simply  not  the
    case, submitted Ms Daykin, Article 8 rights are considered first within
    the Immigration Rules and then outside the Rules, and in this case  the
    judge had given no consideration to paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration
    Rules, in the context of which the Article 8 consideration  could  have
    been undertaken.  It is only if there is an arguable case to  take  the
    matter outside the Immigration Rules can  the  judge  then  venture  to
    consider freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence.

14.  Second,  in  this  case,  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  applied  because  the
    applicant was aged 18 years or over, and had lived continuously in  the
    UK for less than twenty years, and her case was that she did  not  have
    any ties left in China.

15. Third, the Appellant's claim that she had no ties in China  were  based
    on the fact that she was a widow, and was an adopted child herself, and
    had no contact with her biological family, and had  no  relatives  left
    upon whom she could rely in China.  In fact, since 2003  the  Appellant
    had visited her daughter in the UK eight times.  The case  of  Ogundimu
    [2013] UKUT 60, confirmed that the concept of ties involved  "something
    more than merely remote or abstract links to the  country  of  proposed
    deportation or removal", but did involve "a connection to life in  that
    country".  The Appellant's case was that she had no such connection  in
    that country.  She relied upon the case of Bossadi [2015] UKUT 42 which
    required there to be a rounded assessment  as  to  whether  a  person's
    familial ties could result in support  to  him  in  the  event  of  his
    return,  and  this   required   both   a   subjective   and   objective
    consideration.

16. Fourth, the judge also erred at paragraph 41 when stating that, "if the
    Appellant is permitted  to  remain  then  she  would  undoubtedly  have
    recourse to the National Health Service which though not  prevented  by
    the Immigration Rules is obviously a factor that  must  come  into  the
    equation", as the sole question in this respect before  the  judge  was
    whether the Appellant had ties to China, and the  reference  to  having
    recourse to NHS facilities was entirely irrelevant to that  assessment.



17. Finally, the judge's reliance upon Section 117B of  the  2002  Act  (at
    paragraph 40) was an error because the judge had regard  to  irrelevant
    considerations, since that provision is only relevant to the assessment
    of  a   "public   interest   question",   which   was   an   issue   of
    "proportionality", and this did  not  apply  in  the  consideration  of
    whether the Appellant had ties to China.  This was  a  case  where  the
    Appellant's ties with her daughter were established at a time when  her
    status was not precarious and was longstanding.  The  judge  had  given
    regard to irrelevant considerations and inevitably  reached  the  wrong
    conclusions.

18. For her part, Ms Everett submitted that she would rely upon the Rule 24
    response.  This was an attempt, she claimed, by the Appellant to  bring
    herself into the dependent relative category, but the judge  had  given
    clear reasons for why this could not happen at paragraphs 20 to  26  of
    the determination.  It was simply not plausible that the Appellant  had
    no remaining relatives in China given that she had  been  living  there
    permanently and had only visited the UK  on  numerous  occasions.   The
    judge looked at all the evidence and came to the conclusion that he was
    entitled to.  There was no error of law.

19. In reply, Ms Daykin submitted that Article 8 was engaged in  any  event
    because the judge had already stated (at  paragraph  35)  that  if  the
    judge was wrong about the financial dependency and the  remittances  of
    the Sponsor's monies to the Appellant, "the ultimate  question  to  ask
    is, is it proportionate to exclude her from the  United  Kingdom?"   In
    these circumstances the judge should have given proper  regard  to  the
    Razgar steps and a consideration of these  steps  is  entirely  missing
    from the determination.

Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should  set  aside  the  decision.   My  reasons  are
    essentially those that have been clearly and succinctly put before this
    Tribunal by Ms Daykin.  First, the judge  has  erred  fundamentally  in
    neglecting to consider  Article  8  within  the  context  of  paragraph
    276ADE, rather than looking at freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence  in
    its own right.

21. Second, even where the judge does so (and especially given the  judge's
    reference to whether it was "proportionate  to  exclude  her  from  the
    United Kingdom" at paragraph 35), there is no application of the Razgar
    steps.

22. Third, the analysis of whether the Appellant has any ties left to China
    is muddled and confused and confusing.  Regard  is  had  to  irrelevant
    considerations in the form of the Appellant's  reliance  upon  the  NHS
    facilities   and   the   public   interest   consideration.    Relevant
    considerations are not taken into account in the  sense  prescribed  by
    the Tribunal  decision  in  Ogundimu  where  what  is  required  is  an
    appreciation of whether the Appellant has a connection to life  in  the
    home country.

23. Finally, not enough consideration has been  given  to  the  Appellant's
    medical condition in the  form  of  her  ischaemic  heart  disease  and
    degenerative bone disease which is a deteriorating  situation  for  her
    and for which there is no cure  in  the  future.   These  are  matters,
    however, which cannot be determined by this Tribunal.

Remaking the Decision

24. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal to the extent that it is remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal, to be  heard  by  a  judge  other  than  Judge
    Hussain under Practice Statement 7.2(b) because the nature or extent of
    the judicial fact-finding which is necessary in order for the  decision
    in the appeal  to  be  remade  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the
    overriding objective, it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-
    tier Tribunal to be determined again.

Notice of Decision

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined  by  a  judge
    other than Judge Hussain at the first available opportunity.

26. No anonymity order is made.
