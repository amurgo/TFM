For the Appellant:     S Wawrzynczak, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    G Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the SSHD against the  decision  of  the  FtT  (the
    panel) who allowed the appeal by the claimant  (as  we  shall  describe
    him) against the decision to remove him to his country of  nationality,
    Poland where he was born 10 August 1989.

 2. That decision was made under the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 on 23  January  2013  which  followed  the  claimant's
    conviction on 17 September 2012 at Bolton Crown Court of  two  offences
    of robbery for which he  was  sentenced  to  one  year  and  16  months
    imprisonment.

 3. The circumstances  of  the  offences  were  that,  with  another,   the
    claimant snatched or attempted to snatch an iPod from a female  as  she
    returned alone from work in the Bury town  centre  at  10  30  pm.  She
    fought back and retained her iPod. Her hand which had  a  piercing  was
    ripped in the struggle.  The claimant and his accomplice (who  is  also
    from Poland) then went to another part of the town  centre  where  they
    attempted to snatch a mobile phone from a 16 year old male who was also
    walking alone after asking him the time.

 4. The sentence reflected the claimant having pleaded at  the  very  first
    opportunity and the claimant having no previous convictions which  lead
    the sentencing judge to describe the offence as out of  character.  The
    judge rejected the submission that the claimant was impressionable  and
    naï¿½ve but that it was a planned offence. Aggravating  factors  included
    there having been more than one offender, the offence was  pre-planned,
    the use of a form of disguise on one of them (a hoodie and  peak  cap),
    the offence having been committed  at  night  and  both  victims  being
    vulnerable. On the positive side the  judge  found  there  was  minimal
    force, property was not taken and remorse had been  demonstrated.  Both
    offenders were intoxicated which the  judge  described  "could"  be  an
    aggravating factor.

 5. The panel heard evidence from  the  claimant  and  his  mother  at  the
    hearing of the appeal on 18 April 2013 and  had  before  them  material
    that  included  regarding  the  claimant's  employment  history  and  a
    probation report.

 6. After directing themselves as to  the  law,  the  panel  reached  these
    conclusions on the evidence:

      a) The claimant came to the UK in February 2008 as  confirmed  in  his
         parent's statements and he was registered by  the  SSHD  under  the
         Worker Registration Scheme on  17  June  2008.  In  order  for  the
         claimant  to  have  permanent  residence  he  would  need  to  have
         continuous residence for 5 years from  the  earlier  of  these  two
         dates. At the date of the deportation decision the claimant did not
         have a right of permanent residence.

      b) A serious view was taken of the offence however taking  account  of
         the view by the SSHD as to the claimant's deportation, the  remarks
         of the sentencing judge and the factors  in  regulation  21(5)  the
         decision to deport was not  justified  on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy.

      c) In reaching this conclusion, the panel took account of the  absence
         of any previous convictions either here or in Poland, his good work
         record and the offence having been committed when he was under  the
         influence of alcohol when in the company of  someone  who  did  not
         have a good character as observed by the sentencing  judge.   There
         was no evidence that he had previously become intoxicated which had
         led to any misbehaviour. There  was  no  satisfactory  evidence  of
         addiction to alcohol or drugs. It would appear  to  be  a  one  off
         incident and the claimant had expressed remorse. The  claimant  had
         been a model prisoner and had done all that had been asked of  him.
         The  only  family  he  had  in  Poland  was  his  grand  and  great
         grandmothers. On release the claimant would have the support of his
         family.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on an application that challenged  the
    determination on the basis that the panel erred in failing to give  any
    reasons for their finding's on the risk of re-offending. It had  failed
    to make any findings as to the claimant's alcohol problems, the use  of
    drugs and his lack of responsibility for his alcohol problems.  Alcohol
    had been the main factor in the offence. It was also  argued  that  the
    tribunal had failed to provide reasons whether he will still  associate
    with negative peers. The claimant's age was not a factor which  reduced
    his culpability. He could readily adapt to life in Poland where he  had
    support.

 8. We heard argument from the parties and reserved our  determination.  In
    essence Mr Harrison relied on the grounds and by  way  of  response  Ms
    Wawrzynczak defended the decision by restating  (or  advancing  further
    argument) the arguments that she had made before the FtT. This  led  to
    Mr Harrison adopting the same approach and he set out reasons  why  the
    decision should have been otherwise.

 9. We reminded the parties that we needed  to  first  decide  whether  the
    panel had erred in law. Both Mr Harrison and  Ms  Wawrzynczak  accepted
    that in the event that we decided to set aside and remake the  decision
    we could do so without the need for further argument or evidence.

10. The challenge as acknowledged by Mr Harrison is a reasons one;  he  did
    not seek to argue irrationality but  that  the  panel  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for  finding  that  the  baseline  criterion  for  the
    removal of the claimant who had not yet acquired a right  of  permanent
    residence, had not been met in the light of the role alcohol had played
    in the  offence  and  its  potential  to  undermine  the  low  risk  of
    reoffending predicted in the probation report.

11. The evidence of the way in which alcohol had been a factor was noted by
    the sentencing  judge.  He  appears  to  have  considered  it  had  the
    potential to have  been  an  aggravating  factor  although  he  doesn't
    indicate a settled view. The probation officer noted the claimant's own
    account of the role alcohol played in his life and he  also  considered
    that this was an aspect that needed to be addressed. There is no reason
    to believe that the officer did not take this into account in  deciding
    the risk of reoffending which he identified as low as to the likelihood
    of reconviction and of re-offending.

12. The panel too looked at this aspect and reached a conclusion rationally
    open to them that the evidence that it  considered  did  not  establish
    addiction. There is thus no basis on which it can  be  said  that  they
    ignored this aspect or that they failed to factor it  in  deciding  any
    risk that the claimant posed. It was a matter that was  raised  by  the
    SSHD at the hearing reflected in [19] and addressed in [37].

13. The panel reasons were reached after a correct directed  themselves  as
    to the  legislative  framework   they  were  required  to  apply  under
    regulation 21 as noted at [21] to [24].

14. Our conclusion is that this  appeal  boils  down  to  no  more  than  a
    disagreement with a reasoned conclusion that was properly open  to  the
    panel and one that is not infected by error.  Accordingly the appeal is
    dismissed.






Signed                                  Date 30 September 2013
