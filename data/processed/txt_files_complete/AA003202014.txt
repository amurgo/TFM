Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr J Nicholson, instructed by GM Immigration Aid
Unit
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Nicole Estelle  Kpoku,  date  of  birth  11.3.73,  is  a
    citizen of Cote D'Ivoire.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Birrell, who dismissed her appeal against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent,  dated  23.12.13,  to  refuse  her   asylum,   humanitarian
    protection, and human rights claims, and the decision  on  24.12.13  to
    remove her from the UK, pursuant to section 10 of the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 1999.

 3. The Judge heard the appeal on 16.5.14.

 4. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    19.6.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 15.9.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Birrell should be set aside.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Grant agreed that in making her
    credibility findings the First-tier Tribunal Judge "failed to give  any
    reasons for rejecting the evidence given  by  the  appellant's  brother
    Achille Kpokou and that she has thereby  arguably  erred  in  law.  All
    other grounds are arguable."

 8. The Secretary of State's Rule 24 response, dated 1.7.14,  accepts  that
    the First-tier Tribunal did not  make  a  finding  in  respect  of  the
    appellant's brother's evidence in relation to Paul N'Dre. "However, the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the appellant did not mention  him
    in her screening interview and neither did her brothers in their claim.
    This finding is at paragraph 28 of the  determination.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge clearly does not believe that aspect of  her  claim  and
    this is further set out at paragraphs 29-31 of the  determination.  The
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  has  made  adequate  findings  of  fact  at
    paragraph 36 in respect of 276ADE(vi)."

 9. In his oral submissions, Mr Nicholson relied  on  three  main  grounds.
    First, that  the  judge  failed  to  deal  with  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's brother; second, that in error the judge sought or required
    corroboration of the appellant's account; and  third,  that  the  judge
    erred in finding that the appellant has ties to Cote D'Ivoire.

10. At �24 the judge stated that she was going to summarise  "some  of  the
    main reasons for my finding that the appellant has failed to prove  the
    truth of her history and thus has failed to  demonstrate  that  she  is
    entitled to be treated as a credible witness. However my summary should
    not be seen as an exhaustive  list  for  my  reasons  for  reaching  my
    decision. I would re-state that I have taken into account the  totality
    of the appellant's evidence before reaching my findings."

11. In relation to the first and second grounds. At  �29  the  judge  found
    that there was no evidence to support the appellant's claim that she is
    related to Mr N'Dre. As a bare statement that was  inaccurate,  as  the
    appellant's brother  Achille  Kpokou  (AK)  confirmed  the  appellant's
    account and the relationship with Mr Dre. The grounds complain that the
    judge gave no reason why she did not accept this evidence.

12. However, it is clear that the Judge had considered the evidence of  AK,
    both his witness statement and his oral evidence, which  is  summarised
    at �16 of the determination, to the effect that he had met Mr N'Dre  on
    two occasions; once when he was 10/11 years of age, and  once  when  he
    was about 17. She also referenced the other brother's statement at �28.
    However, the judge also noted at �28 that there was no reference to  Mr
    N'Dre, in the screening interview. It was also pointed out that it  was
    not a reason given by her mother for leaving Cote D'Ivoire in  her  own
    asylum claim. In fact,  as  the  judge  pointed  out  at  �26,  in  the
    screening interview the basis of the appellant's claim was in  relation
    to her father's family. I note that there has been no challenge by  the
    appellant to the finding at �27  of  the  determination  rejecting  the
    appellant's claim of fear of her father's family and being poisoned  by
    them. The claim in relation to Mr N'Dre was in essence  a  claim  first
    made at a later stage, in her asylum interview.

13. It is in that context that the judge arrives at the finding at �29 that
    there is "no evidence to support the  appellant's  claim  that  she  is
    related as claimed to N'Dre."  In  the  light  of  the  foregoing,  the
    finding  has  to  be  understood  as  there  being  no  independent  or
    satisfactory evidence to support the appellant's claim of relationship.
    As the judge went on to explain, whilst  it  had  been  raised  by  the
    appellant in her witness statement, and such information was  important
    because is not in public domain, "it is of course only helpful  to  her
    if it can be proved that the information is accurate which has not been
    demonstrated. In fact the only detail that  can  be  confirmed  is  his
    ethnicity which is information that is in the public domain." I find in
    the circumstances that the judge was entitled  to  reject  the  claimed
    relationship.

14. This was not the judge requiring corroboration  of  the  claim,  but  a
    detailed  evaluation  of  the  evidence,  pointing  out  that  it   was
    unsupported by any independent or  objective  evidence  in  the  public
    domain. By this stage the judge had already found the appellant's story
    inherently  implausible  and  internally  inconsistent.   The   claimed
    depended in large part on the family's close links with Mr  N'Dre,  but
    at �28 the judge rightly points out the virtual absence of reference to
    Mr N'Dre in other evidence. When evaluating the  appellant's  claim  on
    this issue the judge had to assess the credibility of  the  appellant's
    evidence. Clearly, some independent or objective  confirmation  of  the
    relationship would have gone to assist the strength of the  appellant's
    claim. It was not wrong for the judge to point out the absence of  such
    independent supporting evidence.

15. The statement of AK, dated 16.5.14, does make reference  to  Mr  N'Dre,
    but on a reading of the statement as a whole, it is clear that this  is
    not independent evidence of the matters complained of by the appellant.
    AK came to the UK in October  2001.  His  witness  statement  does  not
    directly explain the relationship, but at �9 a family  relationship  is
    inferred. He thought he had met Mr N'Dre twice,  when  as  a  child  he
    accompanied his mother to his office. The statement  does  not  clearly
    state the nature of the relationship,  but  in  his  oral  evidence  as
    recorded at �16, it is stated that he was happy to see his sister, AK's
    mother. There is no evidence that he has ever mentioned this before and
    thus it is entirely self-serving of the appellant's claim for it to  be
    produced now. Such an assertion can carry little evidential  weight  as
    it is no more than an assertion raised in support  of  the  appellant's
    own unsupported claim. The witness statement of the other brother,  who
    did not give evidence at the Tribunal, does not  mention  Mr  N'Dre  at
    all. Thus the evidence of the brothers is limited  and  couls  at  best
    carry little evidential weight. It remains the case, as  relied  on  by
    the  respondent,  that  there  is  no  independent  evidence  that  the
    appellant is related as claimed to Mr N'Dre. No other family member has
    been arrested or detained as  a  result  of  the  claimed  association.
    Neither of her brothers nor her mother made  mention  of  Mr  N'Dre  in
    their various claims.

16. At �31 the judge reached the conclusion that the appellant's  claim  in
    relation to Mr N'Dre was made in part to explain her  very  significant
    delay in claiming asylum, made only when her  husband's  leave  expired
    and her claim as EEA dependant of her brother failed.

17. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any error of law
    in this regard. I find that the judge was fully aware of and took  into
    account all of the evidence and reached a fair and balanced  assessment
    of that evidence in relation to the claimed relationship with Mr  N'Dre
    and gave appropriate weight to the evidence on the issue. Even  if  the
    judge had specifically referred to the evidence of AK in �29, I am  not
    satisfied, given the very limited weight such a  statement  can  carry,
    that it would or could have changed the outcome of the  appeal  or  the
    finding of fact in relation to this part of the  appellant's  claim.  I
    reject the assertion that the judge was requiring corroboration of  the
    appellant's assertion as to the relationship. The evidence was a matter
    of weight to be attached to it as assessed by the  Tribunal  judge,  in
    the light  of  the  judge's  assessment  of  the  appellant's  evidence
    generally and her credibility. The appellant has  not  shown  that  the
    judge's assessment of that evidence  is  perverse  or  irrational.  The
    appellant has failed to demonstrate that the way  in  which  the  judge
    dealt with the evidence amounted to a material error in the  making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

18. In relation to ground 3, it  is  submitted  that  the  judge  erred  in
    finding that the appellant retained ties to Cote D'Ivoire. Reliance  is
    made on Ogundimu (article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60  (IAC),
    where ties is defined as a concept involving something more than merely
    remote or abstract links to the  country  of  proposed  deportation  or
    removal. "It involves there being a connection to life in that country.
    Consideration of whether a person has 'no ties' to such a country  must
    involve a rounded assessment of all of the relevant  circumstances  and
    is not to be limited to 'social, cultural and family' circumstances."

19. The Rule 24 response submits that the judge made adequate  findings  at
    �36 in respect  of  paragraph  276ADE(vi).  The  judge  considered  the
    submissions  of  the  appellant's  representative  at  the   First-tier
    Tribunal  appeal  hearing,  stated  that  she  did  not  accept   those
    submissions, and  went  on  to  give  her  reasons.  In  light  of  the
    credibility findings the judge rejected  the  appellant's  attempts  to
    distance herself from Cote D'Ivoire. The appellant lived  most  of  her
    life in Cote D'Ivoire, she retains the language and has regular contact
    with her sister-in-law in Cote D'Ivoire. She has  been  in  the  UK  12
    years and has children here. These are all matters of  weight  for  the
    judge to consider. I find that the appellant has failed to  demonstrate
    that the conclusion on paragraph  276ADE  is  perverse,  irrational  or
    otherwise flawed. In essence, the grounds on this  issue  are  no  more
    than an attempt to re-argue the case.

20. I note that at �37 to �39, pursuant to  Gulshan,  the  judge  found  no
    arguably  compelling  circumstances  for  considering  article  8  ECHR
    outside the Immigration Rules, even  taking  into  account  the  mental
    health concerns of the appellant. The grounds did not submit  that  the
    judge was wrong to apply Gulshan.

21.  In  the  alternative,  the  judge  also   found   the   decision   was
    proportionate. In undertaking that balancing exercise, the  judge  took
    account of the appellant's current circumstances, including that  as  a
    student she could have had no legitimate expectation to  remain  beyond
    leave and compliance with the Immigration Rules. The  circumstances  of
    the children  and  their  best  interests  were  also  considered,  but
    ultimately those circumstances did not outweigh the public interest  in
    removal.

22. In  the  circumstances,  I  find  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of judge Birrell and the appeal must stand as  dismissed.



Conclusions:

23. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case.
