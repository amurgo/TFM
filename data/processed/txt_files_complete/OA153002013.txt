Representation:

For the Respondent:    Ms E Greenwood, Counsel instructed by G Singh
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The history of this matter is  set  out  in  a  determination  which  I
    promulgated on 18 September 2014.

3.   At that stage I found there was an error of law because the  judge  had
    not, with reference case law then in existence, considered  whether  or
    not Article 8 ECHR outside  of  the  Rules  was  engaged.   Since  that
    decision the cases of MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA  Civ.  985,  SS  (Congo)
    2015 EWCA Civ. 387 [31-33] and Khalid and Singh  [2015]  EWCA  Civ.  74
    together with other case law have indicated that there is no  threshold
    before consideration of Article 8  outside  of  the  Rules  and  simply
    identify  the  kinds  of  factors  that  such  words  as   'exceptional
    circumstances' will be expected to be seen if it is going to  be  shown
    that a decision is disproportionate.

4.   Issues had previously been considered under the Immigration  Rules  but
    it was common ground that the Claimant did not succeed  under  Appendix
    FM  or  other  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   In  substance
    therefore the question was whether or not the Claimant  could  show  at
    the date of the ECO's decision Article 8 ECHR rights were engaged.  The
    ECO's decision was dated 20 June 2013.

5.   The Claimant's Sponsor is a British national and  it  is  fair  to  say
    that in deciding an error of law  had  been  made  there  was  no  real
    challenge by the ECO against the judge's assessment of the  credibility
    of the Claimant's mother (RM) and Sponsor, Mr JM, the husband of RM.

6.   There is no issue that  the  Claimant  is  female,  date  of  birth  17
    February 2005 and is a citizen of India.  It is clear that as a  matter
    of law the Sponsor, who was the stepfather of the Claimant, was not  in
    a recognised relationship so as to enable him  to  bring  the  Claimant
    into the United Kingdom as a relative of his.  Similarly, his  wife  RM
    only had discretionary leave and therefore was unable to be the  person
    for whom the Claimant could join.

7.   Judge Chamberlain who dealt with the appeal in  June  2014  found  both
    the Claimant, the Sponsor and mother credible witnesses of fact,  as  I
    did.

8.   It is correct to say as has previously been noted that there  are  some
    inconsistencies  identified  between  oral  evidence  given   and   the
    documentary evidence but those did not form matters of significance and
    partly were attributable to the fact that neither the  Sponsor  nor  RM
    are well-educated or have good English language skills.

9.   Again, as previously noted, some of the documentation relating  to  the
    Claimant's schooling was by no means accurate but it seemed to me  that
    may be the fault of others but they are not  matters  of  weight  which
    fundamentally go to the reliability of the account given.  Thus, I  too
    give little weight to a letter from the Claimant's school  obtained  by
    RM's sister, S, who in part appears to  be  without  communication  and
    reading skills so as to pick up on the mistakes that have been made.

10.   On  balance,  even  if  the  ECO  has  not  been  able  to  check  the
    'certificate of guardianship',  I  find,  read  as  a  whole  with  the
    entirety  of  the  evidence,  it  is  consistent  therewith   and   the
    responsibilities had fallen upon RM who, with  the  assistance  of  her
    sister S, has provided day-to-day care in India.

11.  It is clear that the Claimant has gone to  school  and  the  issues  of
    schooling have been under the direction of RM.  Similarly, the finances
    have again been through the Sponsor and the direction of RM.

12.  It appears that when the sister, S, had  taken  on  the  obligation  of
    caring for the Claimant  it  had  been  thought  it  was  for  a  short
    duration; whilst RM got to the United Kingdom  and  settled  here.   It
    simply had not been contemplated by S that she, as  a  woman  now  aged
    some 35 years, should continue to be saddled with the general care  for
    the Claimant.  Rather the evidence points to the fact that it would  be
    to the benefit of the Claimant to be  reunited  with  her  mother.   It
    appears that RM's motive for coming to the United  Kingdom  was  to  be
    with the Sponsor and was always with the underlying intention to  bring
    the Claimant to the United Kingdom when she could.

13.  I therefore concluded that the relationship between RM and S  was  such
    that S was now seeking, as a woman who was unmarried, to  make  a  life
    for herself free of the responsibilities of caring  for  the  Claimant.
    Similarly I accepted the evidence from RM and the Sponsor that there is
    no other relative  who  would  take  on  the  day-to-day  care  of  the
    Claimant.  I agree with Judge Chamberlain that the Claimant now is at a
    formative and important stage where the direct care of  her  mother  is
    significant.  I also agree that the Sponsor's presence in employment in
    the United Kingdom, with the financial obligations which he  has  here,
    it is not a desirable object to relocate to India.  I do not  see  that
    it would be reasonable to expect RM to be required to return to  India.
    Nor do I accept there is any realism in a boarding school as an  option
    because of the two short holidays before the long Indian summer holiday
    where the Claimant would not be able to stay  in  school  and  someone,
    unknown, would have to look after her.  It does not seem to me that  it
    is sensible when RM has employment, her employers will not agree to her
    returning for the shorter four week school holidays in the year nor  is
    it particularly desirable, even if it is available as  an  option,  for
    the Claimant to otherwise be required to stay in school for the rest of
    the year.

14.  Considering this matter outside of the Rules I have of  course  applied
    the decision in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and Huang [2007] UKHL 11.  I have
    looked at all the evidence in the round.  The Claimant's mother and the
    Sponsor are both employed.  I accept the Sponsor's  evidence  that  his
    own relatives are based in the area where the Claimant  lives  but  his
    brother is a lorry driver by occupation and his hours  and  obligations
    are different and unorganised to provide the care for the Claimant.   I
    note that the Sponsor is self-employed with his own shop  business  and
    so taking periods of time off is not as easy as it once was.

15.  It seems to me that at the age the Claimant is  now,  this  is  a  time
    when she should be with her mother.  Whilst in most cases there will be
    other family members in this  case  I  accept  the  evidence  that  the
    Claimant cannot effectively be farmed out to other  relatives  to  care
    for her and nor in the interests of her development is  such  a  course
    desirable.

16.  Maintaining contact by electronic means  assuming  they  are  available
    and not going to break down is of course a possibility but it really is
    not sufficient to meet the kind of care needed by the Claimant.

17.  I take into account that the Sponsor earns about �25,000 and  RM  earns
    some �12,000, producing a total gross income of some �37,000 and, as is
    pointed out, the requirement for two parents plus  one  child  for  the
    purposes  of  appropriate  financial  provision  is  �24,500.   In  the
    circumstances it seems to me that there is the financial wherewithal to
    make proper and adequate provision for the Appellant.  Whilst I do  not
    think as a fact making return visits is untenable it plainly  makes  no
    economic sense and makes  the  Claimant's  mother  more  likely  to  be
    dependent upon the Sponsor.  It is said that it is a relevant fact that
    because Ritaben, the mother, had failed an English  language  test  and
    therefore only obtained discretionary leave to remain, that in order to
    properly provide by the  Claimant  the  entire  family  would  have  to
    relocate to India and that that is a disproportionate outcome.

18.  On balance it seems  to  me  that  this  is  the  kind  of  case  which
    illustrates the importance of the public interest and the need to  give
    it proper weight.  In the circumstances I do so but find that  in  this
    case the  considerations  that  would  normally  militate  against  the
    Claimant's  entry  to  the  United  Kingdom  show  that  the  prolonged
    separation  between  RM  and  the  Claimant  and  its  continuance   is
    disproportionate.

NOTICE OF DECISION

18.  The appeal under the Immigration Rules is dismissed.

19.  The appeal is allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

20.  Given the age of the Claimant it seems to me that  an  anonymity  order
    is necessary and appropriate.

DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY - RULE 14 OF  THE  TRIBUNAL  PROCEDURE  (UPPER
TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court  directs  otherwise,  the  Claimant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Claimant and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply  with
this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Fee Award

The appeal has succeeded because of the deeper and greater knowledge of  the
Claimant's circumstances and a more fuller expression and  understanding  of
the  continuing  relationship  between  the  Claimant  and  her  mother  and
Sponsor.  I do not find a fee award is appropriate.
