Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr P Turner, instructed by Lex House Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant  appeals,  with  permission  granted  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on 20 August 2019, against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Lloyd-Lawrie) which, in  a  determination  sent  on  11
    July 2019, dismissed  his  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision taken on 25  February  2019  to  refuse  his  application  for
    settled status on the grounds of 10 years lawful residence.

 2. The respondent relied on a single discrepancy between  the  appellant's
    claimed income in a previous immigration application in March 2011  and
    his return to the Inland Revenue for the same tax period.  The  earlier
    immigration application required him to meet a financial threshold.  In
    the immigration application he stated an  employed  income  of  �22,000
    topped up with an additional self-employed income earned  in  the  last
    quarter of the tax year i.e. the three months between December 2010 and
    March 2011, of �13,830. The resulting combined income of  some  �33,800
    was sufficient to meet the Tier 1 entrepreneur rules.  The  application
    was made in March 2011, i.e. before  the  end  of  the  tax  year.  Tax
    returns for that tax year were not due until the period after  the  end
    of the tax year i.e. April 2011 and could  be  submitted  prior  to  31
    January 2012. The respondent noted that the appellant in the event  had
    declared to the Inland Revenue a much  lower  self-employed  income  of
    �1,325. The respondent concluded this was a deliberate  deceitful  act:
    either the appellant had not earned the money and had lied to obtain an
    immigration benefit, or  he  had  earned  the  money  and  deliberately
    underdeclared to the Revenue to obtain a tax benefit. The deceit  meant
    that the appellant failed the character suitability requirements of the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) at paragraph 322(5). Finally, the
    Secretary of State concluded that the consequences of the  refusal  did
    not result in unjustifiably harsh consequences such that the  appellant
    should succeed under Art 8 outside the Rules.

 3. The appellant appealed arguing that the decision breached Art 8 because
    the discrepancy arose from an innocent error on his part and was due to
    the failure of his accountant at that time, who may or may not in  fact
    have been an accountant, so that refusing him  leave  to remain so that
    he and his wife and children  had  to  return  to  Bangladesh,  was  an
    unwarranted interference with their private and family  life  developed
    here.

 4. The Judge found that the discrepancy  was  primary  facie  evidence  of
    deception and moved to consider whether the  appellant  discharged  the
    burden  of  providing  a  plausible  innocent  explanation.  The  Judge
    concluded that the appellant had not, and found that the respondent had
    discharged the burden of showing on the balance of  probabilities  that
    the appellant had been deceitful and correctly refused the  application
    under the discretionary refusal provisions at paragraph 322(5)

 5. At the hearing before us, both parties were represented, there  was  no
    application to submit any additional documentary or oral evidence,  and
    the matter proceeded on the basis of submissions.

 6. The grounds  argue  that  the  Judge,  in  finding  the  appellant  was
    deliberately deceitful, failed to take into  account  material  factors
    such as:

      1) The  discrepancy  was  a  single  discrepancy.  The  appellant  had
         asserted in his witness statement  at  paragraph  11  that  he  had
         continued to run his consultancy business and pay full  income  and
         corporation tax since  this  initial  tax  return  for  the  period
         2010/11. The grounds argue that on that witness statement  evidence
         this was an initial mistake which "must tally" with a relative lack
         of knowledge and experience.

      2) The Judge failed to give proper consideration to the  payment  made
         to Ms Ismail on 9 August 2011.

      3) HMRC had concluded that  the  discrepancy  arose  as  a  result  of
         carelessness and not deceit.

 7. This is not a case where the Judge failed to take into account relevant
    considerations which  might  have  supported  the  credibility  of  the
    application.  The  grounds  are  correct  in  pointing  out  that   the
    frequency/number of errors can be of relevance so that a single mistake
    in the first tax return an appellant was  required  to  file  might  be
    viewed in a  different  light  from  a  series  of  mistakes  that  are
    corrected at a later date. The  appellant's  explanation  would  become
    less plausible if he alleged a  series  of  unlikely  mistakes  by  his
    accountant. However, when the grounds at paragraph 8  assert  that  the
    fact of this being a single error "must tally with a relative  lack  of
    knowledge and experience in the system", they mistake the role  of  the
    Judge which is to decide the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  evidence.
    Similarly where the grounds at paragraph 10 argue that the Judge failed
    to have regard to an otherwise  unblemished  history  with  HMRC,  they
    conflate the requirement for the Judge to  "have regard"  to  a  factor
    with the assertion that because the error  is  a  single  error  it  is
    determinative of innocence.

 8. That there is a  single  discrepancy  is  not  determinative.  Although
    ground one asserts that the Judge failed to consider the infrequency of
    the discrepancy, as the  particularisation  recognises,  the  challenge
    here goes to the issue of weight. It cannot be said that the Judge  did
    not take into account that this was a single error. The Judge correctly
    rehearsed the chronology, including the singleness of  the  discrepancy
    relied upon, not least  when  she  sets  out  firstly  the  appellant's
    explanation at paragraph 9 (iii) and  the  parameters  of  the  dispute
    between the parties about the instance of dishonesty at  paragraph  16,
    and secondly, at paragraph 19 when she refers in the singular  to  "the
    discrepancy".

 9. The second limb of the grounds concerns the  evidence  of  the  payment
    made to Ms Zahira Ismail on 9 August 2011. In summary, the  appellant's
    account is that in order to make his Tier 1 entrepreneur application he
    approached an adviser, Ms Ismail, who explained to him that to  make  a
    Tier 1 application he needed  to  establish  his  income  by  providing
    accounts and she introduced him to a firm of accountants, whom he  then
    paid directly  to  prepare  accounts  for  the  three-month  period  of
    December 2010 to the beginning of March  2011,  which  the  accountants
    sent to him for his approval. Those accounts were  submitted  with  the
    application to the respondent through Ms Ismail. Subsequently, he  sent
    by email a copy of his P60 concerning his employed income to Ms  Ismail
    on 4 August 2011. A copy of that email was pasted into an email to  the
    solicitors representing the appellant in this appeal in  2019  and  was
    included in his bundle before the First-tier  Tribunal.  The  appellant
    said that he did that because she had contacted him and told  him  that
    she wanted to prepare his return to the Inland Revenue.  Similarly,  he
    provided an email to a colleague of hers dated 9 August 2011 explaining
    that he was going abroad to Bangladesh until December and asking if  he
    needed to come in beforehand or if things could be picked up  after  he
    returned from Bangladesh in December. In the same  email  he  confirmed
    that he had transferred  �190  from  his  bank  account  on  9  August,
    described as "Zahira  LEND  BBP".  The  appellant  told  the  Judge  he
    described it to the bank as a loan because of  his  uncertainty  as  to
    what the payment was for. The appellant told the Judge  that  he  never
    heard anything further, he never received a copy of any self-assessment
    submitted on his behalf. The next he knew of it was when the respondent
    contacted him in 2017 in response to  his  application  for  indefinite
    leave to  remain  and  pointed  out  the  discrepancy  to  him  in  his
    interview.  It  is  his  assumption  that  the   work   was   completed
    incorrectly. Hence his assertion that his "accountant who  may  or  may
    not be an accountant" had  filed  the  false  tax  return  without  his
    knowledge. The appellant's evidence was that, having  been  advised  of
    the discrepancy in 2017, he paid the  tax  due  as  calculated  on  the
    accounts  prepared  and  submitted  in  support  of   his   immigration
    application.

10. In his bundle of evidence, the appellant  provided  an  email  sent  in
    February 2019 to Ms Ismail, in which he sets out that she had  prepared
    his tax return incorrectly and that it had caused him  a  problem  with
    his immigration history. He says  that  he  had  sought  administrative
    review and judicial review of the respondent's decision  and  that  the
    respondent had pointed out in the judicial review proceedings  that  he
    had failed to provide any evidence from his accountant confirming their
    responsibility for  the  error.  He  said  that  he  had  attempted  to
    telephone her but the number was not working and he had been unable  to
    get her address or new telephone number.

11. We pause to note that this email was sent to the same email address  as
    the earlier August 2011 emails,  and  that  they  stand  alone  as  the
    evidence of the appellant's contact with his adviser.

12. The appellant put before the Judge a response from Ms Ismail  dated  14
    February 2019 in  which  she  denies  having  acted  as  his  agent  or
    accountant for the HMRC in submitting a tax return. Ms Ismail states:

         "It was always clients (sic) responsibility to declare income to HM
         Revenue and Customs and pay the correct amount of tax.

         To best of our knowledge, we supported you in registering for self-
         employment and to receive your UTR number.

         Further, we ceased our accountancy operation since the  year  2011,
         and we do not hold any files or records which are  older  than  six
         years or more."

13.  The  submission  before  us  is  that  the  Judge  misapprehended  the
    importance and relevance of the  email  correspondence,  including  the
    response from Ms Ismail because it showed that, as the appellant  said,
    he was in contact with her during the  relevant  period  prior  to  the
    submission of the self-assessment tax return, and so counted positively
    towards the credibility of his believing that she  was  submitting  his
    self-assessment tax return and would do so correctly.  In reality  this
    is nothing more than a re-arguing of the appellant's case.

14. Counsel before us was not the representative on the day. The ROP  shows
    that the appellant told the Judge that he  believed  firstly  that  his
    immigration  consultant  worked  for  the  accountants   and   was   an
    accountant. On the one hand he said he saw nothing  strange  in  having
    paid the accountants directly for the preparation of  the  accounts  in
    March 2011, and then being asked to pay Ms  Ismail  directly  into  her
    personal bank account in August 2011, but also that he  was  suspicious
    as to what it was that she was asking  money  for  and  so  accordingly
    entered it as a loan payment on his bank statement. As he explained  it
    to the Judge "I had no idea what self-assessment is,  I  was  employed,
    did not know have to pay tax. Maybe she was just trying  to  get  money
    from me. Used lend so can get money from her later."

15. It was suggested to us that Ms Ismail's assertion that she  had  simply
    been obtaining a UTR and registering  the  appellant  as  self-employed
    made no sense at all because he had started his self-employment as  per
    the accounts in December 2010 and would have been  required  to  obtain
    his unique tax reference, i.e. the UTR, within  three  months  of  that
    date namely before the end of that tax year, and to have registered  as
    self-employed.  The  difficulty  with  that  submission  is  that   the
    documentary evidence to support that  contention  was  not  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. Indeed, the documentary evidence before the First-
    tier Tribunal included the  company  registration  documentation  which
    shows that the company was registered in September 2011.  Further,  the
    appellant's oral evidence set out in the ROP was that  he  started  his
    consultancy firm in September 2011, albeit he was doing the  work  from
    the end of 2010.

16. Accordingly, and contrary to the submission before us, the  documentary
    evidence of the email correspondence is not so clear  as  to  show  any
    misapprehension as to its  import.  The  Judge  took  account  of  that
    evidence in the round. Having had the benefit of hearing and seeing the
    appellant give his evidence, the Judge was entitled to  find  that  the
    appellant, who is highly educated to degree level and with  a  Master's
    degree, was implausible when he failed to make any follow-up  enquiries
    in connection with a self-assessment tax return which he never  thought
    that he had to submit, and when  he was suspicious of  the  demand  for
    funds, evidence of which he never obtained, particularly  when  in  the
    context of his earlier contact with a legitimate firm of accountants he
    had an existing avenue through which to make enquiries.

17. The Judge dealt with this evidence  at  paragraph  20  and  21  of  the
    decision. We note firstly that what is set out there accords  with  the
    documentary evidence.

18. At paragraph 3 the Judge reminded herself  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment in Balajigari and others v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673 which  had
    given guidance on the approach  to  take.  The  Judge  correctly  self-
    directed at paragraphs 18 and 19 in respect of the burden of proof  and
    the need for fair process.

19. At the hearing before us, Mr Turner sought to enlarge  the  grounds  to
    argue that the Judge had incorrectly concluded that the  appellant  had
    had the  opportunity  of  putting  his  plausible  explanation  to  the
    respondent. Mr Turner suggested that when the appellant was interviewed
    in 2017 it was not plainly put to him that the respondent thought  that
    the discrepancy between his immigration application and tax return  was
    dishonest.  The  appellant's  understanding  was  that,  although   the
    discrepancy was drawn to his attention, and he gave his explanation, he
    was left with a view that all the respondent required from him was that
    he should resolve the discrepancy with the Inland Revenue. This exceeds
    the grounds of the application for permission but,  in  any  event,  we
    find that it does not take the appellant's case further. As  the  Judge
    noted, there had been  an  earlier  decision  in  May  2018  which  the
    appellant had challenged, and not only  through  administrative  review
    but also through judicial review proceedings as set out  in  the  email
    correspondence. Balajigari involved judicial review, where the impugned
    decision maker was the Secretary of State rather than a Judge as  here,
    but the same principles apply. There is no basis  for  suggesting  that
    the appellant here has been subjected to an unfair process resulting in
    his being unable to put his explanation either to the respondent  prior
    to the making of the new refusal decision of 25 February 2019 or to the
    Judge in these appeal proceedings.

20. The final point the Judge is said to have failed to give weight to,  is
    the Inland Revenue's having treated the discrepancy in the  tax  return
    as careless behaviour. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the  First-
    tier Tribunal placed no reliance on  that  point:  the  point  made  in
    submissions to  the  Judge  was  that  HMRC  could  have  conducted  an
    investigation but did  not  and  chose  to  treat  the  discrepancy  as
    careless behaviour. The grounds accept that the  Tribunals  and  Courts
    have given short shrift to the submission that HMRC's position  can  be
    binding on the SSHD or the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  grounds  assert
    however that in Balijigari at paragraph [74] Lord Justice Underhill did
    not rule out its significance in the round:

         "we further bear in mind that there would be nothing to prevent the
         applicant from drawing attention to the fact that HMRC had enquired
         into matter and had decided not to impose a penalty or had  decided
         to impose a penalty at a lower rate, which signified that there had
         been carelessness rather than dishonesty. That would be information
         which was within an applicant's own knowledge and they  could  draw
         this to the attention of the Secretary of State".

21. On the face of the Judge's decision, the appellant  did  in  this  case
    draw it to the Judge's attention.

22. On the face of the evidence the appellant, following the interview with
    the respondent in 2017 and through his  newly  instructed  accountants,
    wrote to the Inland Revenue revealing the under-disclosure of income in
    bald terms, without mentioning that the matter had come to light  as  a
    result of Home Office  enquiries  in  the  context  of  an  outstanding
    immigration application. HMRC wrote to the appellant. They do  not  set
    out  in  their  letter  the  reasons  why  they  did  not  launch   any
    investigation  as  to  fraud  but  simply  accepted  the  assertion  of
    carelessness and accepted the offer of voluntary repayment.   The  HMRC
    state that as such, and because the discrepancy had occurred more  than
    six years ago they could not conduct their own reassessment  or  compel
    the repayment of tax due. The total tax, outstanding National Insurance
    Contributions, and interest amounted to some �3,700. It was paid by the
    appellant in instalments. However, the fact that HMRC did not launch an
    investigation  and  decided  to  treat  the  discrepancy  as   careless
    behaviour rather than dishonesty does  not  mean  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was perverse in concluding that the  appellant  had  not
    provided a plausible innocent explanation and that the  respondent  had
    established on the balance of probabilities that the appellant had been
    deceitful.

23. The Judge reiterated her conclusion at paragraph 29 that the  appellant
    practised deception, whether to obtain an  immigration  benefit  or  to
    escape paying tax and concluded that the only reason the appellant paid
    his  outstanding  tax  was  in  order  to   bolster   his   immigration
    application. Figures were prepared on  the  same  self-employed  income
    basis as those submitted to the respondent, i.e. one month short of the
    full tax year.

24. It is all too easy for an appellant to point to selective parts of  the
    evidence which support  his  case,  but  an  allegation  of  perversity
    requires an assessment of the evidence in its totality. Although  there
    is evidence of Ms Ismail's  involvement in June/August  2011,  and  the
    submission is that her correspondence could be explained in a way which
    when viewed or interpreted in a particular  way  would  show  that  she
    might be lying when she said her involvement was limited to registering
    the appellant as self-employed and  obtaining  his  UTR  i.e.   matters
    other than the self- assessment, the appellant did  not  bring  forward
    evidence about those matters.  This is not a case where  the  appellant
    provided a copy  of  the  erroneous  self-assessment  tax  return,  nor
    evidence from the HMRC that Ms Ismail was  his  nominated  or  approved
    agent for the submission of the 2010/11 tax  year  return,  or  a  case
    where she has accepted that did  submit  the  tax  return  without  his
    knowledge or signature as he says. There is  nothing  in  the  evidence
    which is determinative so as to show any mistake of fact or perversity.



25. The question of weight was a matter for the Judge who had  the  benefit
    of hearing the evidence. That a different  Judge  may  have  reached  a
    different  conclusion  does  not  establish  an  error  of  law  absent
    perversity. The appellant has had an opportunity to obtain and give his
    evidence as well as to call witnesses.  It is not for  us  to  re-weigh
    the evidence and reach our own conclusion.

26. The Judge was undoubtedly correct to find that, on  the  facts  as  she
    found them, the appellant failed under the Rules.

27. The Judge then went on to consider the appellant's  Art  8  claim.  The
    Judge concluded that, as the appellant could not meet  the  suitability
    requirements, any interference with his private and family  life  would
    not be disproportionate.  It has never been the appellant's case  that,
    even were the respondent right to find that he  had  been  deliberately
    deceptive, he ought nonetheless to have been allowed leave to remain on
    the basis of his family and private life rights. On the basis  of  that
    finding, it would  have  seemed  obvious  that  the  appeal  should  be
    dismissed as no breach of Art 8 had been established.  The grounds take
    no issue with the Judge's reasoning in this  regard,  and  it  was  not
    suggested in submissions before us that, in the event that we found the
    appellant had been correctly viewed as deceptive, he nonetheless had  a
    good Art 8 case which had been overlooked.

28. For these  reasons,  the  Judge  did  not  materially  err  in  law  in
    dismissing the appellant's appeal.

Decision

29. The First-tier Tribunal's decision dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
    did not involve the making of an error of law and it stands.
