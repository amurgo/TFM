                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

1.   This is an appeal under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006  against
    revocation of  a  residence  card  that  was  dismissed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Adio on the basis that the appellant was prevented  from
    appealing under Regulation 26 because he  had  no  passport.  This  was
    because the Liberian authorities refused to  renew  his  passport  (for
    reasons that are disputed by the appellant).

2.   The appellant was given permission to appeal by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Eshun.

3.   The appellant's representatives, UK Immigration Legal  Services,  wrote
    to say that they were instructed  by  the  appellant  to  withdraw  the
    appeal.

4.   Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  requires
    the consent of the Tribunal for withdrawal.  I give that consent.   The
    appeal is withdrawn.


Signed                                  Date


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Gibb
