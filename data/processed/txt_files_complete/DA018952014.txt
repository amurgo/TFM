                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. This appeal comes before me  by  way  of  a  transfer  order  dated  07
    September 2015 made pursuant to  the  Senior  President  of  Tribunals'
    Practice Statements. In a determination signed on 21  July  2015  Upper
    Tribunal  Judge  Grubb  identified  material  errors  of  law  in   the
    determination of Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Perry's  decision
    promulgated on 07  January  2015  dismissing  the  Appellant's  asylum,
    Article 3 and Humanitarian Protection claims against  the  Respondent's
    decision of 29 August 2014 to make a deportation order against  him  by
    virtue of section 32(5) of the UK Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration
    Act 2009 Act 2007, but allowing the appeal under Article 8.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Somalia, date of birth 17  August  1994.
    He entered the United Kingdom on 20 March  2002  with  his  mother  and
    younger siblings. He was 7 years old. His father  was  already  in  the
    United Kingdom and had been granted indefinite leave  to  remain  as  a
    refugee on 24 February 2001.

 3. On 24 April 2002 the Appellant's mother made an asylum application  but
    this was subsequently withdrawn and an application for indefinite leave
    to remain made instead. On 03 October 2005 the Appellant and his family
    were granted 3 years Discretionary Leave until 02 October 2008. Despite
    making applications for further Discretionary Leave on 02 October  2008
    the application was refused due  to  non-payment  of  fees.  A  further
    application made on 05 February 2009 was refused for the  same  reason.
    The Appellant has subsequently remained in the United  Kingdom  without
    leave.

 4. On 23 August 2011 the Appellant was convicted of possessing  controlled
    drugs with intent to supply. He  received  a  12  month  Detention  and
    Training Order on 13 September 2011. On 09 May 2012 he was convicted of
    possession of a class B drug and fined ï¿½50.  On  16  May  2012  he  was
    convicted of failing to comply with a Detention and Training Order  and
    sentenced to two months detention in a young offender's institution. On
    29 October 2012 the Appellant was convicted of possession of a class  A
    drug and remanded in prison. On 14 January 2013 and  18  February  2013
    the Appellant was convicted of failing to comply with the  requirements
    of a Community Order  and  received  periods  of  unpaid  work.  On  13
    December 2013 the Appellant was convicted at Isleworth Crown  Court  of
    two counts of unlawful wounding and violent disorder and was  sentenced
    to 30 months detention in a young offender's institution in respect  of
    the first count and to 8 months in respect of the second count, to  run
    concurrently.

 5. The Appellant  was  originally  served  with  notice  of  liability  to
    deportation on 03 October 2011 and on 20 April 2012 he was served  with
    a notice to a person liable to removal. He claimed asylum on 01 October
    2012. He underwent a screening  interview  on  02  November  2012.  His
    asylum claim was refused oh 13 May 2013. on 16 June 2014 the  Appellant
    was again notified that he was liable to deportation under  the  United
    Kingdom Borders Act 2007  and  that  section  72  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applied on the basis that he  had  been
    convicted of a particularly serious and that his continued presence  in
    the United Kingdom constituted a danger to the community. On 29  August
    2014 the Respondent  refused  the  Appellant's  claim  for  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection and under Articles 3 and 8 ECHR  and  certified
    the Appellant's asylum claim under section 72.





The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The Appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal heard evidence from  the  Appellant  and  his  various  family
    members. The  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeal  on  asylum,
    humanitarian protection grounds and under  Article  3.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  however  allowed  the  appeal  under  Article  8.  The
    Respondent sought permission to appeal the decision to allow the appeal
    under Article 8 and also the First-tier Tribunal's finding that section
    72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 did  not  apply.
    Permission  was  granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Following   a
    misguided attempt by  the  Appellant  to  cross-appeal  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's Article 3 findings in a rule 24 response, the Upper Tribunal
    adjourned the appeal to enable the Appellant's  permission  application
    to be considered by the First-tier Tribunal. On 05 June 2015 the First-
    tier Tribunal granted the Appellant permission to  appeal  against  the
    dismissal of the appeal under Article 3.

The error of law hearing

 7. At the Upper Tribunal hearing held in Newport on  10  July  2015  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Grubb found the First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  engage
    with the Appellant's claim under Article 3 relying on MOJ & Ors (return
    to Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 (IAC) where,  at  (xii),  it
    was recognised that  a  person  from  a  minority  clan  (such  as  the
    Appellant) returning to Mogadishu without means of support was at  risk
    of having to live in an IDP (Internally Displaced  Person)  camp  where
    there was a real possibility  that  the  conditions  would  fall  below
    acceptable humanitarian standards and breach  Article  3.  Judge  Grubb
    found that,  without  proper  findings,  the  Appellant's  claim  under
    Article 3 was arguable.

 8. Judge Grubb found there had additionally been a material error  of  law
    in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  consideration  of  the  Appellant's
    family and private life. The First-tier Tribunal failed  to  apply  the
    immigration rules as they were after the 28 July 2014  and  this  error
    was not vitiated by the First-tier  Tribunal's  assessment  of  section
    117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as  the  Judge
    had not made any findings of fact in relation to  this  provision.  The
    First-tier Tribunal also failed to apply paragraph 398 as in  force  at
    the date of the hearing to its consideration of whether there were very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paragraphs
    399 and 399A so as to outweigh the public interest. Moreover, the First-
    tier Tribunal's error in applying the wrong version of  paragraph  399A
    necessarily infected its consideration of  Article  8.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge also failed to consider Article 8 through  the  lens  of
    the immigration rules which amounted to a complete code in  respect  of
    deportation, and it was not clear  that  the  Judge  had  in  mind  the
    approach to family life between adult children and their  siblings  and
    parents  identified  in  Singh  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630. None of the evidence as set out by  the
    Judge in his determination specifically dealt with the issue of whether
    there was 'mutual dependency', not just economic but otherwise, between
    the Appellant on the one hand and his siblings on the other. The First-
    tier Tribunal's findings that the Appellant had established family life
    with his siblings was not sustainable. Judge Grubb  indicated  that  it
    would be a matter for the Appellant at the resumed hearing to establish
    that he enjoyed family life with his family in the United Kingdom.

 9.  It  emerged  from  a  discussion   between   Judge   Grubb   and   the
    representatives that,  in  principle,  the  positive  finding  made  in
    respect of the Appellant in relation to the absence  of  support  which
    his family would be able to offer him in Somalia should be preserved as
    set out in Mr Lams skeleton argument at paragraph 2.

The transferred hearings on 13 October 2015 and 25 November 2015

10. At the outset of the hearing  on  13  October  2015  Ms  Isherwood  was
    granted  permission  to  serve  an  additional  background  bundle   of
    materials consisting of the March 2015  COIS  report  on  minority  and
    majority clans in south and central Somalia. She indicated that page 34
    of the 39 page bundle related to  the  Benadiri  clan.  She  relied  on
    paragraphs 1.3.7, 2.2.7, 2.3.1, 2.5.11, 2.5.12 and 2.6.14. I  permitted
    Mr Lams to adduce a further  statement  from  the  Appellant's  father,
    dated 08  July  2015,  and  DWP  correspondence  relating  to  benefits
    received by the Appellant's mother. In preparation  for  the  adjourned
    hearing on  25  November  2015  the  Respondent  provided  two  witness
    statements from Wendy Gilbert,  an  officer  of  HMRC,  both  dated  16
    November 2015, two  DWP  documents  summarising  searches  of  the  DWP
    computer system, both dated 22 October 2015, a GOV.UK download relating
    to child benefit, and a copy of an unreported Upper  Tribunal  decision
    (DA/01528/2014). At the hearing on 25 November 2015 Mr Lams provided an
    amended skeleton argument, an income and expenditure table relating the
    Appellant's family, a water bill, council  tax  bills,  HMRC  documents
    relating to the Appellant's mother and father, a Jobcentre Plus  letter
    dated 22 September 2015 relating  to  the  Appellant's  mother,  and  a
    Barclays Bank statement relating to his mother. A handwritten note from
    the Appellant's younger sister was produced, as was a letter  from  the
    Saluja Clinic, dated 16 November 2015, relating to the medical problems
    suffered by the Appellant's mother. During the hearing the  Appellant's
    father produced a Metro bank statement issued in November 2015.

11. The following is a summary  of  the  material  evidence  given  at  the
    hearings. At the transferred hearing on 13 October 2015  the  Appellant
    adopted his statement and gave his evidence in English. He lived with a
    cousin because of his licence conditions. His parents lived in the part
    of Southwark he was not entitled to enter. Prior to his imprisonment he
    lived  with  his  parents.  He  identified  his  parent's  address  and
    indicated that his parents, his sister ([S], born in the United Kingdom
    in August 2002) and 3 of his brothers resided there. His brother, [An],
    who was 18 years old, did not  at  the  time  work.  His  oldest  half-
    brother, [Aa], who was 23 years old, lived in Bristol and did not work.
    [Af], another half-brother who was 22 years old, also lived in  Bristol
    with his wife and he worked. The couple had a child 'on the  way'.  Ai,
    the last of the Appellant's half-brothers,  was  believed  to  live  in
    London but the Appellant was not sure where  or  whether  this  brother
    worked. His parents did not work and his case was  legally  aided.  The
    Appellant believed his parents were both in receipt of mobility related
    benefits. His family received child tax credits and his cousin did  not
    work and was in receipt of benefits.

12. Ms Isherwood confirmed that the Applicant's mother's asylum  claim  and
    those of his younger  siblings  from  2013  remained  outstanding.  The
    Appellant's brothers who lived with his parents ([An], [Al]  and  [Ar])
    did not have any lawful immigration status. The Appellant believed [Aa]
    had ILR, that [Af] was British, and that his  father  and  sister  were
    British. The Appellant maintained  he  had  no  friends  or  family  in
    Mogadishu. He did not believe his parents would be able to support  him
    as they did not get enough money. His parents  struggled  to  send  him
    money when he was detained.

13. When asked whether he could work in Mogadishu  the  Appellant  said  he
    could barely speak Somali. He knew only the basics of the language  and
    used a mixture of Somali and English when he spoke to  his  mother.  He
    would start with a word  in  Somali  and  would  end  in  English.  The
    Appellant did not have a university degree. He 'just about' passed some
    GCSEs. He had an NVQ level 1 qualification  in  bricklaying,  carpentry
    and plumbing which he obtained  while  in  school.  He  completed  some
    courses while in prison and  produced  the  original  certificates.  He
    enjoyed football and was involved in a 3 month  rugby  course.  He  had
    certificates in first aid and cleaning skills.

14. In cross-examination, having noted that his  parents  were  to  use  an
    interpreter to give their evidence, the Appellant said he spoke English
    and Somali to his parents, and they understood  English.  He  sometimes
    had difficulty communicating with them. At home he spoke to his  mother
    in Somali. He spoke to his parents every 3 to 4 days but hardly saw his
    brothers. He spoke to his brothers whenever he  got  the  chance.  When
    asked why his brothers failed to provide any  evidence,  the  Appellant
    said two of them lived in Bristol, one had a  job  interview,  and  his
    sister and younger brothers were in school. When asked why there was no
    evidence from his cousin the Appellant said she had a child and did not
    speak a lot of English. It was hard to communicate  with  her  but  she
    understood English.

15. Prior to his being detained  the  Appellant  claimed  he  provided  his
    mother with daily care, but he did not do that anymore.  [Aa]  recently
    moved to Bristol.  The  Appellant's  younger  siblings  were  his  full
    siblings. The Appellant's father gave the Appellant about ï¿½21 a week to
    enable him to get around London. He had no financial help  from  anyone
    else. When asked what he did with himself during the day the  Appellant
    said he sometimes went to the gym, and would go out  with  friends,  or
    would not go out. The Appellant explained that his parents  financially
    supported him. The Appellant confirmed that he had been to  Somali  day
    at a youth centre. There was no evidence from friends as they were busy
    and were working. He then explained that he did not ask his friends  to
    provide any evidence because he was embarrassed telling them he had  no
    status and was in the process of being deported.

16. When it was put to the Appellant that, as his mother and  some  of  his
    siblings had no immigration status,  they  could  return  with  him  to
    Somalia, the Appellant said Somalia  was  one  of  the  most  dangerous
    places. It was put to the Appellant that he initially  claimed  he  was
    not born in Somalia and asked why he lied. It was pointed  out  to  the
    Appellant that, at C10 of the Respondent's bundle, he  claimed  he  was
    born in a refugee camp outside Somalia.  The  Appellant  denied  having
    said that. He  was  not  aware  one  of  his  brothers  had  a  robbery
    conviction. The Appellant was not aware of references  made  to  social
    services in respect of his family.

17. The Appellant stated that he was in fear of  his  life  if  removed  to
    Somalia because he  saw  a  documentary  in  2010  about  pirates.  The
    Appellant confirmed he had uncles and aunts in the United Kingdom,  but
    did not see them often. He was not aware when his parents saw his aunts
    and uncles. Most of his relatives on his mother's side were dead.  Some
    lived in other countries, such as an  aunt  in  Saudi  Arabia  and  the
    Appellant spoke to them in Somali, but it was hard  to  understand.  He
    only spoke once in a blue moon and did not know if they  were  working.
    The Appellant said his mother spoke to his aunt, but he  did  not  know
    how often. The Appellant's father had 3 sisters in the United  Kingdom,
    all of whom were British. The Appellant did not really speak  to  them.
    He last saw his aunties 3 or 4 years ago. When asked what he knew about
    his father's part-time job, the Appellant said nothing really.  He  did
    not know how often his father worked, and then said he  did  not  think
    his father had a job. His father had not informed the Appellant that he
    had a job.

18. In re-examination the Appellant said he had never received  money  from
    his aunt in Saudi Arabia. He did receive ï¿½3 to  ï¿½5  from  his  father's
    family in the United Kingdom when he was 13 years old.  Since  then  he
    has not received any money from  his  father's  family.  The  Appellant
    stated that his mother  went  through  phases  of  being  ill  and  was
    currently taking a lot of medication. His mother did not want to return
    to Somalia.

19. In response to questions from me,  the  Appellant  said  that,  if  his
    father got a part-time job, he would have informed the Appellant of the
    fact. The Appellant confirmed that he did not believe his father had  a
    job at the moment.

20. Following his evidence the Appellant was excused from  the  hearing  in
    order to attend Beckett House to ensure he did not breach his reporting
    conditions. With the consent of the representatives  I  heard  evidence
    from the Appellant's father in the Appellant's absence.

21. The Appellant's father, [Mr CMF], adopted his  short  statement  of  08
    July 2015. In this statement he claimed he  had  a  part-time  job  and
    received some public funds. He confirmed that he financially  supported
    the Appellant and would return to living with his parents  as  soon  as
    his  probation  conditions  came  to  an  end.  In  oral  evidence  the
    Appellant's father said he used to work for National Car  Parks  (NCP),
    but that he was no longer employed. He used to work  weekends  and  was
    employed for one year. He stopped working in 2014. It was  pointed  out
    that the letter was dated from July 2015. [Mr F]  claimed  he  received
    Job Seekers Allowance and that his wife was sick. [Mr F]  was  referred
    to a DWP letter of 24 March 2014 addressed to his wife indicating  that
    ï¿½170 was paid into her account in respect of money  owed  to  her  from
    18/02/2015 to 10/03/2015 due to her  'Motability'  agreement  finishing
    early. The letter indicated that DLA would continue being paid into her
    account. [Mr F] indicated that his wife received  benefits  because  of
    sickness. He could not recall the exact figure but it was  around  ï¿½160
    to ï¿½180 per week for him and his wife together. [Mr F] was not aware of
    other benefits he and his wife received. No-one else in  his  household
    was working. His son, [Af], worked but he lived in Bristol. No-one gave
    [Mr F] money and he did not have any savings. He  would  not  be  in  a
    position to send money to his son.

22. [Mr F] confirmed that he gave the Appellant ï¿½20 a week  for  transport.
    He claimed his wife's medical issued  included  blood  pressure,  heart
    problems, epilepsy and muscle pain. She was not able  to  do  anything.
    When asked about the possibility of the Appellant living  in  Mogadishu
    [Mr F] said that the Appellant would be in difficulty as he  could  not
    communicate and did not have anyone there. People in  Somalia  did  not
    have jobs and the Appellant was unlikely to get one. No other  extended
    family members could support the Appellant financially.  The  Appellant
    had matured and now understood responsibility.

23. In cross-examination [Mr F] was asked about his letter of 08 July 2015,
    with particular reference to his part-time work. [Mr F] claimed that he
    was aiming to return to work. He worked  for  3  months  in  2013  then
    stopped in October 2013 as his wife became ill. [Mr F] confirmed he was
    not currently  working.  He  saw  the  Appellant  about  once  a  week.
    Sometimes, if she was feeling better, his wife would come as well.  His
    wife saw the Appellant  about  once  a  month.  [Mr  F]  spoke  to  the
    Appellant every night. He did not know how often his wife spoke to  the
    Appellant. [Mr F] was asked what  the  Appellant  used  the  money  his
    father gave him for. [Mr F] said he used it for transport.  When  asked
    whether he had discussed with the Appellant what he did during his days
    [Mr F] stated that the Appellant does not do  anything  and  stayed  at
    home.

24. When asked about the language in which he and the Appellant communicate
    [Mr F] said it was English, although  he  sometimes  used  Somali.  The
    cousin with whom the Appellant lived was around 25 or 26 and  had  some
    status in the United Kingdom but [Mr F]  was  not  sure  of  the  exact
    status. He did not ask her to write  a  statement  in  support  of  the
    appeal. [Mr F] spoke to the cousin in Somali and English.  He  believed
    she came to the United Kingdom about 2 or 3 years ago. He did  not  pay
    anything towards the Appellant's upkeep. [Mr F] did  not  know  whether
    she was working. He confirmed that he sent money to his  family  before
    they came to the United Kingdom, when they were  in  Ethiopia.  [Mr  F]
    confirmed he had 5 biological children, including  the  Appellant.  The
    other four children were younger than the  Appellant  and  were  living
    with  their  parents.  The  Appellant's  other  three  siblings  had  a
    different father, now deceased. They lived in Bristol. [Mr F]  did  not
    think the Appellant had contact with  his  siblings.  He  thought  they
    might speak by telephone, but was not  sure.  He  maintained  that  the
    Appellant had a good relationship with [An]. The hearing was  adjourned
    at this stage to 25 November 2015.

25. At the commencement of the cross-examination of the Appellant's  father
    on 25 November 2015 [Mr F] was asked why he claimed to have a part-time
    job in his letter of 08 July 2015. He stated that this was  to  support
    his son and to keep him with him. [Mr F] accepted that he lied in  this
    letter. He also accepted that he had not told the truth in the  October
    2015 hearing when claiming to have worked in 2014 and 2013  for  a  few
    months. He said that he previously had a NatWest bank account but  this
    was closed in 2013 and he opened a Metro bank  account  about  a  month
    ago.

26. [Mr F] transported the children to and from school,  did  the  cooking,
    the washing, and most of the household tasks. [An]  helped  his  mother
    with translating at the hospital and  the  GP.  He  also  spoke  broken
    Somali but he knew his mother's medical condition well. [Mr F] did  not
    know why his name did not appear in the  letters  from  Ealing  Council
    dated 1st and 8th  September  2015.  He  confirmed  that  he  lived  in
    Haringey in 2008 and claimed housing benefit  at  that  time,  but  now
    lived with his family. He had difficulties with his marriage but he and
    his wife resolved these difficulties. He could not identify  any  phone
    bills being paid out of the Barclays bank account. [Mr F's] 3  youngest
    children received extra tuition in maths,  science  and  English.  This
    tuition was paid for in cash. He kept invoices but had not brought  any
    with him to the  hearing.  The  tuition  was  ï¿½250  a  month  and  cash
    withdrawals were made to cover this expense. He conformed he could  not
    afford to send the Appellant  money  in  Somalia  as  the  family  were
    struggling financially.

27. [HM], the Appellant's mother, adopted  her  statement  of  30  December
    2013. She gave her evidence via a Somali interpreter. In examination-in-
    chief she confirmed that the Appellant did not speak very good  Somali.
    If she did not understand him she used [Aa] to translate. [Aa] used  to
    live with them but he now lived in Bristol. When asked how she felt  if
    the Appellant was deported to Somalia [Ms  M]  became  distressed.  She
    claimed  she  had  no  family  there.  [Ms  M]  produced  her   various
    medications, although there did not appear to  be  any  specific  anti-
    depressant.

28. In cross-examination [Ms M] said that [Aa] spoke very good Somali.  She
    spoke to the  Appellant  every  day  and  her  children  spoke  to  him
    everyday. [Ms M]  said  she  understood  English  and  spoke  a  little
    English. She had not seen the  Appellant  since  the  previous  hearing
    because she was unwell. Once released from licence [Ms M] believed  the
    Appellant would move back into the family home. He was now 21 years old
    and would be responsible for any crimes he now committed. She confirmed
    that she had 8 children. She confirmed that her husband  left  her  for
    several months in 2008. He left again in 2014 because her illness  made
    her very angry but he came back.  She  could  not  recall  whether  her
    husband also left in 2010, although a reference  in  the  OASys  report
    suggested he may have. Although social  services  had  previously  been
    contacted regarding the care of her children, they were  not  currently
    involved. Her son [An] helped look after her and her  husband  did  all
    the shopping and was responsible for taking the children to school.  He
    also did the washing and the cooking. [An] was previously working for a
    company but after his status expired he could no longer work.

29. [Ms M] confirmed she had a  single  bank  account.  She  believed  that
    payment of the water bill came from the DWP  before  the  DWP  benefits
    were deposited into her account. [Ms M] could not  identify  any  phone
    bill payments coming from her bank account. She explained that if there
    was insufficient cash in the bank account she would use a friend's bank
    account to pay the bill, or sometimes a credit card was used.  She  had
    credit card statements at home but had not brought any to the  hearing.
    [Ms M] said her husband had a Metro bank account and believed  he  held
    this account when she arrived in the United Kingdom. When asked why her
    husband's name did not appear in the Ealing letters she claimed that as
    soon as he returned to the  family  forms  were  completed  and  Ealing
    Borough was informed. Her husband did not claim benefits from any other
    authority and no longer had any address other  than  the  address  they
    shared as a family. She had informed the local authority when  she  and
    her husband separated in 2014.

30. [Ms M] indicated that her children received tuition in  maths,  English
    and science and that the monthly cost was ï¿½250. She reiterated that she
    received financial help from the government and  could  not  afford  to
    send money to the Appellant in  Somalia.  She  did  not  celebrate  any
    connections to Somalia. None of her family members had ever returned to
    Somalia. The cousin with whom the  Appellant  lived  had  been  in  the
    United Kingdom around 3 or 4 years. She  joined  her  husband  in  this
    country but  she  no  longer  lived  with  him.  [Ms  M]  had  met  the
    Appellant's cousin in Ethiopia in 1994. The cousin  had  no  family  in
    Somalia. [Ms M] had a sister, a brother and nieces and nephew in  Saudi
    Arabia. They were living illegally in that country and could  not  help
    the Appellant. [Ms M] was able  to  fund  her  journey  to  the  United
    Kingdom by selling her property in Somalia. She had no money left  from
    the sale. Her husband sent the  family  money  after  they  arrived  in
    Ethiopia. The Appellant's brother, [Af], used to pay for the  Appellant
    to visit the gym but this stopped as the cost of transportation  became
    too expensive.

31. [An], one of the Appellant's brothers,  adopted  his  statement  of  30
    December 2013. There was no examination-in-chief. In  cross-examination
    [An] said he was working for Greenpeace as a  fundraiser  and  studying
    via a distance learning centre. He had been working for a month  and  a
    week collecting subscribers on the street and  received  about  ï¿½350  a
    week. His tuition cost ï¿½140 a month, his travel cost ï¿½100 a week and he
    contributed ï¿½20 to ï¿½30 the household a week. He saw the Appellant every
    couple of weeks and would give him ï¿½20 or ï¿½10. [An] was trying to  save
    his money and would be unable to send the Appellant any money. His  job
    was not guaranteed. He relied on sign-ups. If he  did  not  get  enough
    sign-ups a week he would be fired. [An] was not in contact with  anyone
    in Somalia. He communicated with  his  mother  in  broken  Somali.  His
    father did most of the cooking. He relied on himself. In re-examination
    he understood that his asylum claim would be  considered  before  April
    2016.

32. Mr Ibrahim Osman adopted his letter dated 10 December 2014  and  issued
    on behalf of the Somali Advice and Development Centre. In  examination-
    in-chief he said he met the Appellant 4 or 5  times  in  Feltham  Young
    Offenders Institution. He had not met the Appellant afterwards but  had
    numerous telephone  conversations  with  the  Appellant  following  his
    release from immigration detention. Mr Osman explained why he  believed
    the Appellant had now reformed. Mr Osman indicated that  the  Appellant
    spoke  broken  Somali  and  constructed  sentences  using  an   English
    structure rather than a Somali structure. He indicated he had not given
    evidence before a tribunal before. In response to questions from me  Mr
    Osman indicated that the Appellant  experienced  difficulty  expressing
    abstract ideas in Somali. When he and  the  Appellant  tried  to  speak
    Somali Mr Osman explained that the purpose of their conversation  could
    not continue in Somali and they had to revert to English. Ms  Isherwood
    ascertained that this conversation occurred over the telephone.

33. I heard submissions both from Ms Isherwood and Mr Lams  in  respect  of
    both Article 8 and Article 3 which  have  been  fully  recorded  in  my
    Record of Proceedings and which I have considered in full. In light  of
    the Respondent's certification of the appeal under section  72  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 Mr Lams confirmed that the
    appeal was being pursued on Article 3 and 8 grounds  only  and  not  on
    asylum grounds.

Standard and burden of proof

34. It is for the appellant to prove, to the lower standard of proof,  that
    there is a real risk that his return to Somalia would breach Article 3.
    It is for the Appellant to prove  that  his  return  to  Somalia  would
    breach  Article  8  and  the  standard  of  proof  is  the  balance  of
    probabilities.

Findings and decision

35. The Appellant maintains that his deportation to  Somalia  would  expose
    him to a real risk of a breach of Article 3. He claims there is a  real
    risk he would have to reside in an Internally  Displaced  Person  (IDP)
    camp and would find himself living in circumstances falling below  that
    which is acceptable in humanitarian protection terms.

36. The Appellant relies on the country guidance  decision  of  MOJ  &  Ors
    (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 (IAC).  The  general
    findings of MOJ are set out in its  headnote.  The  following  extracts
    from the headnote are relevant for the present appeal.

         (ii) Generally, a person who is "an ordinary civilian" (i.e. not
         associated with the security forces; any aspect of government or
         official administration or any NGO or international organisation)
         on returning to Mogadishu after a period of absence will face no
         real risk of persecution or risk of harm such as to require
         protection under Article 3 of the ECHR or Article 15(c) of the
         Qualification Directive. In particular, he will not be at real risk
         simply on account of having lived in a European location for a
         period of time of being viewed with suspicion either by the
         authorities as a possible supporter of Al Shabaab or by Al Shabaab
         as an apostate or someone whose Islamic integrity has been
         compromised by living in a Western country.

         ...

         (vii)    A person returning to Mogadishu after a period of absence
         will look to his nuclear family, if he has one living in the city,
         for assistance in re-establishing himself and securing a
         livelihood. Although a returnee may also seek assistance from his
         clan members who are not close relatives, such help is only likely
         to be forthcoming for majority clan members, as minority clans may
         have little to offer.

         (viii)   The significance of clan membership in Mogadishu has
         changed. Clans now provide, potentially, social support mechanisms
         and assist with access to livelihoods, performing less of a
         protection function than previously. There are no clan militias in
         Mogadishu, no clan violence, and no clan based discriminatory
         treatment, even for minority clan members.

         (ix) If it is accepted that a person facing a return to Mogadishu
         after a period of absence has no nuclear family or close relatives
         in the city to assist him in re-establishing himself on return,
         there will need to be a careful assessment of all of the
         circumstances. These considerations will include, but are not
         limited to:

         .    circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

         .    length of absence from Mogadishu;

         .    family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

         .    access to financial resources;

         .    prospects of securing a livelihood, whether that be employment
         or self employment;

         .    availability of remittances from abroad;

         .    means of support during the time spent in the United Kingdom;

         .    why his ability to fund the journey to the West no longer
         enables an appellant to secure financial support on return.

         (x)  Put another way, it will be for the person facing return to
         explain why he would not be able to access the economic
         opportunities that have been produced by the economic boom,
         especially as there is evidence to the effect that returnees are
         taking jobs at the expense of those who have never been away.

         (xi) It will, therefore, only be those with no clan or family
         support who will not be in receipt of remittances from abroad and
         who have no real prospect of securing access to a livelihood on
         return who will face the prospect of living in circumstances
         falling below that which is acceptable in humanitarian protection
         terms.

         (xii)    The evidence indicates clearly that it is not simply those
         who originate from Mogadishu that may now generally return to live
         in the city without being subjected to an Article 15(c) risk or
         facing a real risk of destitution. On the other hand, relocation in
         Mogadishu for a person of a minority clan with no former links to
         the city, no access to funds and no other form of clan, family or
         social support is unlikely to be realistic as, in the absence of
         means to establish a home and some form of ongoing financial
         support there will be a real risk of having no alternative but to
         live in makeshift accommodation within an IDP camp where there is a
         real possibility of having to live in conditions that will fall
         below acceptable humanitarian standards.

37. It is the Appellant's claim that he has no family network of support in
    Mogadishu, that he is unlikely to be offered any support  from  members
    of the Benadiri clan, a minority clan, that his family would be  unable
    to remit any funds to support him, and that he has no means or prospect
    of securing access to a livelihood.

38. The Appellant entered the United Kingdom as a 7 year old as a dependent
    of  his  mother  alongside  his  full  siblings.  He  has  consistently
    maintained that he has never been back to Somalia and that he no longer
    has any family in the country. Similar evidence has  consistently  been
    given by his mother and father. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Perry  found
    (at paragraph 63) that the Appellant did  not  have  any  relations  in
    Somalia and this factual finding was preserved by Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Grubb  in  his  error  of  law  decision  (paragraph  52).   In   these
    circumstances I am satisfied that  the  Appellant  does  not  have  any
    family members or relatives in Somalia.

39. The Appellant maintains that he speaks only 'broken' Somali. He  claims
    his principle language of communication is English and  that,  although
    he  does  speak  with  his  mother  and  his  cousin  in  Somali,  this
    communication is fraught with difficulties and he often has  to  revert
    to English. This assertion was supported by the oral evidence from  his
    parents and his brother. His mother claimed that, when speaking to  the
    Appellant, she sometimes had to ask her older son, [Aa], to  translate.
    Given that [Aa] was now living in Bristol Ms Isherwood properly pointed
    out that this stretched the boundaries of credibility. I also take into
    account the fact that his father admitted  to  lying  to  the  Tribunal
    about his employment. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom  aged
    7 and remained living with his family, who were  Somali  speakers.  The
    evidence given in the previous First-tier Tribunal hearing was that  he
    sometimes attended a Somali youth  centre  and  socialised  with  other
    Somalis. I find, having regard to this evidence, that  there  has  been
    some exaggeration of the degree to which the  Appellant  is  no  longer
    proficient in Somali.

40. I do however attach weight to the evidence  of  Mr  Osman.  He  is  not
    related to the family and has no vested interest in the appeal. He gave
    his evidence in a direct and open manner and there was  no  perceptible
    attempt at any embellishment. I  am  satisfied  he  is  an  independent
    witness. His evidence, relating as it did to his interaction  with  the
    Appellant when detained in Feltham  and  in  respect  of  the  numerous
    telephone conversations following his release, was inherently plausible
    and internally  consistent.  Although  taking  issue  with  Mr  Osman's
    assessment of the risk the Appellant would face on return  to  Somalia,
    and noting that Mr Osman  had  no  linguistic  qualifications  and  had
    attempted a conversation with the Appellant in Somali by telephone,  Ms
    Isherwood did not take issue with the Mr Osman's honesty as a  witness.
    Mr Osman is a fluent Somali speaker who hails from Somalia.  His  claim
    to have studied the Somali language at university in  Somalia  was  not
    challenged by Ms Isherwood. Mr Osman indicated that the Appellant spoke
    broken Somali. When he attempted to have a conversation in Somali  with
    the Appellant they were  unable  to  continue  and  had  to  revert  to
    English. Mr Osman indicated that the Appellant  experienced  difficulty
    in communicating abstract ideas in Somali. Having  holistic  regard  to
    all the evidence before me relating to the Appellant's ability to speak
    Somali I am satisfied, despite  the  attempted  exaggeration  from  his
    family, that his proficiency in Somali is significantly diminished  and
    that he would encounter real  difficulty  in  every  day  communication
    should be returned to Somalia.

41. In MOJ the Upper Tribunal had no difficulty in  accepting  Dr  Harper's
    evidence that Somalis are "particular about how language is spoken"  so
    that differences in accent and vocabulary will be immediately  apparent
    in a conversation with a returnee who has been away for  a  significant
    time. The Upper Tribunal noted, on the other hand,  that  the  evidence
    before it indicated that a very  broad  range  of  accents  was  to  be
    encountered in Mogadishu today. My findings of  fact  relating  to  the
    Appellant's  proficiency  in  Somali  do  however  go   beyond   simply
    differences in accent and vocabulary. I am satisfied that the Appellant
    would struggle to hold a conversation in Somali. His weak grasp of  the
    language is clearly a factor detracting  from  the  likelihood  of  the
    Appellant being able to access employment.

42. Ms Isherwood submitted that I could place no reliance on  the  evidence
    given by  the  Appellant  or  his  family  relating  to  their  claimed
    inability to remit funds to him in  Somalia.  She  submitted  that  the
    Appellant's father was likely to be engaged in  undisclosed  employment
    for which he received cash in hand payments and could  therefore  remit
    funds to the Appellant. In support she relied on the brief letter  from
    the Appellant's father written in July 2015 in which he claimed to have
    a part-time job, and his  accepted  deception  of  this  Tribunal  when
    claiming he had been employed in 2013 or 2014. She also relied  on  the
    absence of any evidence of bank  account  statements  relating  to  the
    Appellant's father other than the single statement issued by the  Metro
    bank in November 2015. She highlighted the absence of any  evidence  of
    payments in respect of the use of mobile phones or  a  landline,  which
    the Appellant's mother claimed came out of the bank  account,  and  the
    absence of withdrawals to pay the water bill. She noted the absence  of
    invoices in respect of the claimed payment for extra  tuition  for  the
    Appellant's younger siblings and the inconsistent evidence  as  to  how
    often these extra lessons occurred, and the different accounts given by
    the Appellant's mother and father in respect  of  the  funding  of  the
    mother's  journey  to  the  United  Kingdom.  She  additionally   noted
    inconsistent evidence  given  by  the  Appellant's  mother  and  father
    relating to how long the father held a Metro bank account and how  many
    times they had separated. Ms Isherwood  also  submitted  that  the  DWP
    evidence adduced by her indicated the Appellant's father was  receiving
    local authority benefits from Haringey Council while his wife  received
    benefits from Ealing council, suggesting he lived separately or that he
    was unlawfully claiming benefits from another address.

43. In relation to the very last point, I am  not  satisfied  the  evidence
    adduced by the Respondent supports the submission made on  her  behalf.
    Ms Isherwood produced two documents issued by DWP relating to  searches
    of the DWP computer system in respect of  the  Appellant's  father  and
    mother. Both traces identified the parents  as  residing  at  the  same
    address. The document generated in respect of [Mr F]  stated,  "Subject
    has no claims in his own name. He is being claimed for by his  partner.
    Records indicate Tax Credit  interest  via  HMRC  and  Local  Authority
    Benefit interest via Haringey Council." The  actual  records  were  not
    produced. It is not clear to me what 'Local Authority Benefit interest'
    actually means. The document does not indicate whether  any  'interest'
    is current or historic. [Mr F] gave evidence to the effect that, on one
    of the occasions that  he  separated  from  his  wife,  he  resided  in
    Haringey and  obtained  Housing  Benefit.  If  the  records  relate  to
    historic 'interest', which is entirely possible, then the reference  to
    Haringey Council is consistent with his explanation. The records in the
    name of the Appellant's mother indicate  she  was  claiming  Employment
    Support  Allowance  (ESA)  and  Disability  Living  Allowance.  I  take
    judicial notice that ESA is a benefit for people who are unable to work
    due to illness or disability.

44. Ms Isherwood also produced witness statements from  Wendy  Gilbert,  an
    officer at HMRC, dated 16 November 2015, relating  to  the  Appellant's
    parents. These statements indicated that both the  Appellant's  parents
    were listed  at  the  same  address.  The  statement  relating  to  the
    Appellant's father indicated that  there  were  no  employment  records
    relating to him from 2008/2009 to 2014/2015, and that  there  had  been
    claims for benefits from 2008/2009 to 2011/2012.  This  was  consistent
    with his claim to have no employment. The  statement  relating  to  the
    Appellant's mother indicated that she had no  PAYE  employment  records
    from 2008/2009 to 16 November 2015. The records also  showed  that  she
    was in receipt of child benefit  during  the  tax  years  2010/2011  to
    2014/2015. This is broadly  consistent  with  the  evidence  from  both
    parents.

45. Ms Isherwood  also  produced  a  document  relating  to  child  benefit
    downloaded from the gov.uk website, last updated on 14 July 2015.  This
    indicated that child  benefit  could  not  be  claimed  by  individuals
    subject  to  immigration  control.  Ms  Isherwood  submitted  that  the
    Appellant's mother had not been  entitled  to  the  child  benefit  she
    received. I pointed out to Ms Isherwood  that  there  was  no  evidence
    before me that child benefit could not be claimed by those  subject  to
    immigration control prior to the 14 July 2015. I am  however  satisfied
    that, as the Appellant's mother and her minor  dependents  (other  than
    her daughter) are asylum-seekers, they may not  be  entitled  to  child
    benefit since at least 14 July 2015, and  possibly  earlier.  It  would
    therefore seem that the Appellant's family may in future have access to
    a smaller source of funds than that anticipated  in  their  income  and
    expenditure schedule. This means that  there  has  to  be  considerable
    uncertainty as to whether the family will be able to send any funds  to
    the Appellant if he were removed to Somalia if  their  only  source  of
    funds is by way of state benefits.

46. I find that [Mr F] has lied to this  Tribunal  concerning  his  alleged
    previous employment. I find this reduces significantly any weight I can
    attach  to  his  evidence  in  respect  of  his  employment   and   his
    circumstances generally. His  claim  that  he  supports  his  wife  and
    carries out the daily  household  chores,  including  transporting  the
    children to and from school, cooking, cleaning and shopping, is however
    consistent with the evidence of the Appellant and his  other  witnesses
    and with the medical and ESA and DLA documents relating  to  his  wife.
    The two medical reports before me  (one  dated  25  February  2012  and
    contained in the  original  Appellant's  bundle,  the  other  dated  16
    November 2015) indicates that the Appellant's  mother  suffers  from  a
    number of medical issues affecting her mobility and mood and  that  she
    is  mostly  dependent  on  her  family  members.  The  fact  that   the
    Appellant's mother and his younger brother both stated that another  of
    his siblings also assists in the care of his mother is not inconsistent
    with the [Mr F's] claimed role.

47. Ms Isherwood invited me to draw  an  adverse  inference  based  on  the
    absence of any reference to water or phone bills in the  mother's  bank
    account statement. The mother however claimed that the water bill  came
    out of the benefits she received from the DWP before it  was  deposited
    into her bank account. The water  bill  indicates  that  payments  were
    being deducted via the 'Water Direct' scheme run by  the  DWP.  I  find
    this a credible explanation for the absence of  any  reference  to  the
    water bill in the bank statement. The Appellant's  mother  additionally
    claimed that, on occasions when there are  insufficient  funds  in  her
    bank account, she pays for the phone bill  by  using  a  friend's  bank
    account or a credit card. I find this explanation inherently plausible.
    Although there were minor inconsistencies in respect of how  often  the
    Appellant's younger siblings received supplementary tuition  I  do  not
    find these were such as to undermine the inherent  credibility  of  the
    claim. The evidence as  to  the  subjects  of  the  extra  tuition  was
    consistently given and there were a number of cash withdraws  from  the
    Barclays account cumulatively amounting to over ï¿½250 (the monthly  cost
    of the claimed tuition) which was consistent with the claimed  cost  of
    tuition.

48. The appellant's brother, [An], had been employed for just over a  month
    at the date of the adjourned hearing but his employment  was  dependent
    on him meeting his weekly quota of sign ups, and any money that was not
    spent was saved by him for his own future. I am not satisfied, in these
    circumstances, that the Appellant will be able to rely on  his  brother
    for any funding if removed to Somalia.

49. I have approached the evidence relating to the possibility of the funds
    being remitted to the Appellant on the lower standard of proof and in a
    holistic manner. I have taken account of the absence  of  bank  account
    statements  relating  to  the  father  and  the  inconsistent  evidence
    identified by Ms Isherwood. I  am  nevertheless  persuaded  that  these
    inconsistencies  do  not  materially  undermine  the  otherwise  cogent
    evidence considered above that the Appellant's father is not in receipt
    of any income and that his days involve caring for his wife, for  which
    he receives public funds, and ensuring the household chores  are  done.
    Although the Appellant currently receives around ï¿½21 a month  from  his
    parents, and a small amount from [An] given on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  in
    light of the  possibility  that  the  Appellant's  mother  and  younger
    siblings may not be entitled to some of the benefits they receive, I am
    satisfied there is a real risk that he will be unable  to  receive  any
    funds from his family if returned to Somalia.

50. I have considered the possibility that the Appellant could be  deported
    on the basis that his mother and younger siblings could  accompany  him
    to Somalia as they (with the exception of his sister who is  a  British
    citizen) have no status in the United  Kingdom.  Mr  Isherwood  accepts
    that the Appellant's mother, whose became an overstayer  following  the
    failure to pay the requisite fee for an application of further leave to
    remain in 2008, has an outstanding asylum claim and the  evidence  from
    his brother, [An], is that he and his siblings  also  have  outstanding
    asylum claims which are due to be decided before April 2016.  I  cannot
    speculate as to the Respondent's future decisions. I must consider this
    appeal on the basis of the facts in existence when it is heard. I  note
    however that if his mother's asylum claim is successful  is  it  likely
    that her  minor  dependants  will  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  I
    additionally note her various medical issues as outlined in the two  GP
    reports, a factor that will be relevant  in  any  Article  3/Article  8
    decision. As there has been  no  decision  in  respect  of  his  family
    members outstanding asylum claims, and as these claims are not  clearly
    unfounded on the limited evidence before me, I am not satisfied that it
    is appropriate or reasonable to proceed on the basis  that  his  family
    could accompany him to Somalia.

51. I have been referred to the case of DA/01528/2014. Ms Isherwood invited
    me to take account of this unreported UT decision because it was before
    the UT reporting committee and the  evidence  and  findings  went,  she
    submitted, to the heart of the current appeal. Rule 11 of the  Tribunal
    Practice Directions, issued  in  2010,  indicates  that  an  unreported
    decision can only be cited with permission of the  Tribunal,  that  the
    party wishing to adduce the decision must identify the proposition  for
    which the decision is to be cited, and that the  party  certified  that
    the proposition is not to be found in  any  reported  decision  of  the
    Tribunal and has not been superseded by  higher  authority.  Permission
    will only be given if the Tribunal feels it will be materially assisted
    by the citation as distinct  from  the  adoption  in  argument  of  the
    reasoning to be found in the decision. Such instances are likely to  be
    rare.

52. In her email accompanying the service  of  DA/01528/2014  Ms  Isherwood
    indicated that the decision considered the position of a member of  the
    Benadiri clan in light of MOJ. At the hearing she  submitted  that  the
    decision was of assistance as it indicated how MOJ should be applied in
    respect of a Benadiri claiming  to  have  no  financial  assistance  if
    returned to Mogadishu. Ms Isherwood did not expressly certify that this
    proposition was not to be found  in  any  other  reported  decision  or
    higher authority, but I am satisfied such an assertion was  necessarily
    implicit in her application and Mr Lams did not identify  any  contrary
    decision.  In  these  circumstances  I  am  prepared  to  consider  the
    unreported decision.

53. Ms Isherwood invited me to consider and apply the approach taken by the
    Upper Tribunal in DA/01528/2014 to the instant  appeal.  She  submitted
    that the Appellant had skills he could utilise to support  himself,  as
    did the appellant in DA/01528/2014, and she invited me to consider  the
    findings in that decision in respect of the position  of  Benadiris  in
    Mogadishu.

54. The appellant in DA/01528/2014 was a 40 year old  Somali  man  who  had
    lived in Mogadishu from his birth in 1974 until the early 1990s when he
    and his family fled as a result of the civil war. Unusually, he and his
    family returned to Mogadishu in 1996 and the appellant and his  brother
    only left Mogadishu in 2008, their parents remaining in the city having
    sold their substantial property for $40,000 to a local  Hayiwe  man  in
    respect of whom they had patronage. It is clear at the outset that  the
    appellant  in  DA/01528/2014  lived  for  around  28  to  29  years  in
    Mogadishu. The present Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom as  a  7
    year old and has never returned to Somalia. The evidence  presented  at
    the hearing suggested that  his  mother  and  siblings  stayed  for  an
    undisclosed period of time in Ethiopia having fled Somalia during which
    time they received funds from the Appellant's father  who  was  already
    resident in the United Kingdom.

55. In DA/01528/2014 the Upper Tribunal  considered  the  position  of  the
    Benadiri clan in Mogadishu with reference to MOJ, the  COIR  report  of
    March 2015 and a 2012 Danish report. The Upper Tribunal's attention had
    been directed to country evidence suggesting  that  there  had  been  a
    significant return  of  Benadiri  people  to  Mogadishu  but  the  only
    reference to any such material is the 2012 Danish report, a report that
    was before the Upper Tribunal in MOJ. This report has not been provided
    to me. Other than the March 2015 COIS report I have not  been  referred
    to any further background evidence by either party.  The  extract  from
    the 2012 Danish  report  cited  in  DA/01528/2014  suggests  that  many
    Benadiris had  returned  to  Mogadishu  and  were  successful  business
    people. On this basis the Upper  Tribunal  found  that  the  successful
    businesses would generate  employment  prospects.  I  have  taken  this
    finding into account. The decision in DA/01528/2014 is not however a CG
    case, and is not as yet a reported decision. the March 2015 COIS report
    cites reports issued  after  the  Danish  report  indicating  that  the
    Banadiri are not considered marginalized and that  their  position  had
    materially improved (2.6.14 to 2.6.20), but that they are exploited and
    that, compared to other clans, there were fewer returning to  Mogadishu
    (2.6.16). The COIS report cited another report post-dating  the  Danish
    report indicating that the remaining Benadiri traders in Mogadishu were
    relatively  wealthy,  that  they  usually  manage  to  buy  protection,
    although they could also be  subject  to  extortion  and  blackmail  by
    majority clan militias (2.6.19).

56.  The  appellant  in  DA/01528/2014  had,  inter  alia,  City  &  Guilds
    qualifications in Wall and Floor Tiling,  basic  Constructions  Skills,
    Paint finishing skills and surface preparation skills, two awards in IT
    user skills, a  Cleaning  Professionals  Skills  certificate,  and  OCR
    functional Skills in maths and English. He had worked in a car  factory
    for 7 months and in  a  car  tyre  warehouse  for  18  months.  He  had
    completed 8 weeks of  a  16  week  bricklaying  course.  There  was  no
    apparent issue with  his  proficient  in  Somali.  The  Upper  Tribunal
    attached  weight  to  that  appellant's  relevant   skills   and   work
    experience. This must be contrasted with the present Appellant's skills
    and experience. In oral evidence the Appellant  stated  that  he  'just
    about' passed some GCSEs but no details were produced  and  no  details
    were given of the grades obtained. He also claimed to have an NVQ level
    1  qualification  in  bricklaying,  carpentry  and  plumbing  which  he
    obtained while in school, although no evidence was produced in support.
    I take judicial knowledge of the fact that an NVQ level  1  is  a  very
    basic qualification.  The  Appellant  has  no  work  experience.  I  am
    satisfied, based on his experience of employment and his more extensive
    practical qualifications, that the appellant in DA/01528/2014 was in  a
    significantly more enhanced position to that of the  present  Appellant
    in respect of his ability to secure access to a livelihood.

57. The Upper Tribunal in DA/01528/2014 found it 'highly relevant' that the
    appellant's mother had lived in what was described an as IDP camp,  but
    appeared on the evidence to have been  a  vacant  government  building,
    without any suggestion that she was ever  subjected  to  ill-treatment.
    The present Appellant has not had any family  members  living  in  such
    accommodation since the family fled Somalia. The Upper  Tribunal  found
    the circumstances of the appellant  in  DA/01528/2014  before  he  left
    Somalia,  one  of  the  factors  identified  in  MOJ,  as  being   very
    significant. The Upper Tribunal noted the  return  of  the  appellant's
    family to Mogadishu in 1996 and the patronage of the Hawiye clan member
    which indicated a level of support  available  to  the  appellant.  The
    Upper Tribunal noted that no explanation had been provided  as  to  why
    this man would decline a request from the appellant for help on return.
    In contrast it has never been suggested that the present  Appellant  or
    his family enjoyed the patronage of a majority clan member.

58. Ms Isherwood did not indicate the  basis  on  which  DA/01528/2014  was
    presented to  the  Upper  Tribunal  reporting  committee  to  become  a
    reported case. Given the significant factual  differences  between  the
    two appellants and the  absence  of  any  further  background  material
    before me relating to the position of the Benadiri other than the  COIS
    report  of  March  2015  provided  by  Ms  Isherwood,  I  do  not  find
    DA/01528/2014 to be of material assistance in  the  assessment  that  I
    have to undertake under Article 3. The Upper Tribunal in  DA/01528/2014
    applied the approach to  risk  assessment  identified  in  MOJ  to  the
    appellant before it, and I propose to do the same, taking into  account
    the background evidence before me.

59. Having regard to the non-exhaustive considerations in footnote (ix)  of
    MOJ, I find that the Appellant left Somalia at a young  age  and  as  a
    dependent of his mother while fleeing the civil war. He is  someone  to
    be properly regarded as having no former links with  Mogadishu  of  any
    significance. He was 7 years old when he arrived in the United  Kingdom
    and is now 21. He has therefore been outside Somalia for 14 years,  two
    thirds of his life. I am satisfied he has no  family  or  relatives  in
    Somalia. There is no indication that he has  any  access  to  financial
    resources in Somalia itself. I am satisfied that  the  selling  of  the
    family property to fund the Appellant's journey to the  United  Kingdom
    14 years ago means that he will have no  financial  support  from  this
    source on his return to Somalia. For the reasons I have already given I
    am persuaded, albeit on the lower standard  of  proof  only,  that  the
    appellant's family will be unable to remit any funds to him  should  he
    be deported to Somalia. Because of  his  lack  of  proficiency  in  the
    Somali language, and his lack of any work experience, and  because  the
    Benadiri are a minority clan, I am not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant
    would be able to call upon  support  from  the  Benadiri  community  in
    Mogadishu. The March 2015 COI guidance indicates,  at  1.3.8  &  2.2.7,
    that persons from minority ethnic groups continue  to  be  marginalised
    and face discrimination in Mogadishu,  and  are  more  vulnerable  that
    other groups. I find that the Appellant's lack of any work  experience,
    his unfamiliarity with Mogadishu and  its  people  and  practices,  his
    possession of anything other than the most basic of qualifications, and
    his lack of proficiency in Somali, means that he has few  prospects  of
    securing a livelihood and that there is a real risk he will  be  unable
    to access the economic opportunities produced by the economic boom.

60. I am consequently satisfied that there will be a  real  risk  that  the
    Appellant  may  have  no  alternative  but   to   live   in   makeshift
    accommodation within an IDP camp where there is a real  possibility  of
    having  to  live  in  conditions  that  will  fall   below   acceptable
    humanitarian standards, and that his removal would therefore constitute
    a breach of Article 3.

61. Having found that the Appellant's removal would  breach  Article  3,  I
    need not consider whether his removal would also constitute a breach of
    Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal Judge made a material error of law.
