                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 27 June 1977 who divorced
    his Spanish national wife on 17 November 2014.

 2. On 8 May 2015 he applied for a residence card as confirmation of his
    right to reside in the United Kingdom under Regulation 10(5) of the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 3. In a decision dated 13 October 2015 the application was refused on the
    basis that the Secretary of State did not accept that the appellant's
    ex-wife was exercising free movement rights in the UK at the time of
    the divorce.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where his appeal was
    heard by Judge Monson.  In a decision promulgated on 22 February 2017
    the judge dismissed the appeal.  The appellant is now appealing against
    that decision.

 5. In order to support his claim before the First-tier Tribunal that his
    ex-wife was working at the time of the divorce the appellant adduced
    the following documentary evidence:

      1) Payslips covering the period between April and November 2014 from a
         company called Racingbrakes.Com Limited showing the appellant's ex-
         wife earning a regular monthly income of �644.

      2) A letter dated 26 October 2015 from a Mr Adegoke who identified
         himself as a general manager of Racingbrakes.Com Limited.  The
         letter states that the appellant's ex-wife commenced working for
         the company on 6 April 2014 and gave a tax reference number for
         her.

      3) A P60 for the tax year ending 2015 showing an income for that year
         of �6,440 and a tax refund from previous employment of �0.01.

      4) A printout from Companies House showing Racingbrakes.Com's status
         as active.

      5) Printouts from several third party websites referring to
         Racingbrakes.Com and specifying its address.

 6. The judge dismissed the appeal on the basis that he did not accept that
    Racingbrakes.Com Limited was genuinely trading in the period leading up
    to termination of the marriage and that the appellant's ex-wife was
    genuinely employed by them.  The judge's reasoning for this conclusion
    is set out in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the decision.  The judge stated
    in these paragraphs the following:

         "17. I accept that there are no internal inconsistencies in the
             payslips or the P60.  However, the level of remuneration which
             was purportedly being paid to the ex-wife was at a level such
             that the purported employer did not have to account to HMRC
             for either income tax or national insurance.  So I attach
             little weight to the payslips and the P60 in circumstances
             where (a) there are no corresponding bank statements showing
             the sums in the payslips going into the ex-wife's bank account
             and (b) there is no documentary evidence of the company
             trading between April and November 2014, or subsequently.

         18.  The appellant's credibility is undermined by the fact that he
             did not provide a contact number for the employer with his
             application.  Moreover, there is inconsistency between what he
             said in his witness statement about how he obtained the
             employer's letter, as against what he said in his oral
             evidence.  The clear implication of what he said in his
             witness statement was that he had obtained the employer's
             letter by going to the employer's premises.  In his oral
             evidence he said that he had obtained the employment letter
             from his ex-wife's cousin, who acted as an intermediary..."

 7. The grounds of appeal argue that the judge applied a higher evidential
    threshold than required by drawing adverse inference from the lack of
    bank statements to match the appellant's ex-wife's payslips and from
    the absence of documentary evidence to prove the company was trading
    between April and November 2014.  It is also argued that the judge
    failed to take proper account of the letter from the general manager of
    Racingbrakes.Com Limited.

 8. Before me, Mr Obawe, who was unrepresented, reiterated the points made
    in the grounds.  He also sought to introduce into evidence a document
    appearing to be from HMRC concerning his ex-wife's income both from
    employment and self-employment during the relevant period.  This
    document was not before the First-tier Tribunal and the appellant
    clarified that he had only obtained it after the hearing.  The
    appellant also claimed that the discrepancies identified by the judge
    between his oral and written evidence about obtaining the letter from
    his ex-wife's employer was due to a misunderstanding by his solicitors.



 9. Mr Jarvis argued that the judge had considered all of the evidence that
    was before the First-tier Tribunal about Racingbrakes.Com Limited and
    it was for the judge to decide based on that evidence if the company
    was genuine.  The judge was entitled to give weight to the absence of
    evidence showing the company was operating including the lack of an
    internet presence.  Mr Jarvis noted that the judge had explicitly
    considered the letter from the general manager.  He also stated that
    there were inconsistencies in the evidence about how the letter was
    obtained and the judge was entitled to give this weight.  Mr Jarvis
    objected to the new evidence submitted by the appellant being admitted.





Consideration

10. The appellant submitted in support of his claim wage slips and a P60
    from his ex-wife covering the relevant period.  There is nothing on the
    face of these documents to indicate that they are not genuine.

11. The judge gave two reasons for attaching only little weight to the P60
    and the payslips notwithstanding that they appeared on their face to be
    genuine.

12. The first of the two reasons is that there were no corresponding bank
    statements showing the sums in the payslips going into the appellant's
    ex-wife's bank accounts.  The appellant's evidence, as summarised by
    the judge at paragraph 7 of the decision, was that his ex-wife had
    refused to communicate with him following the break up of the
    relationship.  The judge has not made a finding as to whether or not he
    accepts this is true.  If it is true, then it would explain the absence
    of corresponding bank statements because the appellant would have no
    way of obtaining them.  If the appellant has a good reason for not
    being able to obtain his ex-wife's bank statements (and on the face of
    it he does) then the absence of these in the evidence is not a basis
    for attaching little weight to the P60 and wage slips.

13. The second reason the judge gave for not attaching weight to the P60
    and wage slips is that there was no documentary evidence of the company
    trading between April and November 2014, or subsequently.  However, the
    appellant submitted several documents which indicate the company was
    trading.  At page 31 of the appellant's bundle is a printout from
    Companies House stating that Racingbrakes.Com Limited is active and
    that the last return was made up to 15 October 2014.  The Companies
    House printout lists an activity of the company as employing domestic
    personnel which corresponds to the claimed job of the appellant's ex-
    wife.  At pages 32 to 35 of the appellant's bundle is another printout
    from Companies House stating the latest annual returns were filed on 11
    November 2013.  The name of the director on this printout matches the
    name of the person who signed the letter of 26 October 2015 purporting
    to confirm the appellant's ex-wife's employment.

14. Given that the appellant adduced documentary evidence indicating that
    the company was operating at the relevant time and that there appears
    to be a very good reason why he was unable to obtain corroborating bank
    statements from his wife, I find that the First-tier Tribunal's
    rationale for finding that little weight should be given to the
    appellant's wife's P60 and payslips, notwithstanding that they appear
    genuine and are internally consistent, does not withstand scrutiny.
    This is a material error of law such that the decision will need to be
    remade.

15. In remaking the decision I note that the only issue to be resolved is
    whether the appellant's ex wife was working at the time of the divorce.
    The appellant has submitted a substantial body of evidence to
    demonstrate his wife was working, as set out above in paragraph 5. This
    includes his wife's P60 and wage slips from a company called
    Racingbrakes.Com Limited, a letter from the company's manager stating
    the ex wife's tax registration number and confirming her employment,
    and companies' house documentation to show the company was in
    existence.  There is nothing about any of the documents adduced by the
    appellant which suggests they are anything other than genuine. The P60
    and wage slips are consistent with each other. Taken together, this
    evidence shows, on the balance of probabilities, that the appellant's
    wife was employed at the relevant time and thereby exercising Treaty
    Rights.

16. In reaching this decision I have not given consideration to or placed
    any reliance on the new evidence the appellant sought to have admitted.
     Had I found it necessary to consider or take into account this new
    evidence when remaking the decision, I would have adjourned the hearing
    in order to give the respondent time to consider it.





Notice of Decision

   A. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
      law and is set aside.


   B.  I remake the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal under the
      Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

   C. No anonymity direction is made.
