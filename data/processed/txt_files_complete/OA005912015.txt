                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Hussain, Hussain Immigration Law Limited


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I shall refer in this decision to the appellant as the  respondent  and
    to the respondent as  the  appellant  (as  they  appeared  respectively
    before the First-tier Tribunal).  The appellant appealed to the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Grimshaw)  against  a  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse him entry to the United Kingdom as a spouse
    under Appendix FM of HC 395 (as amended).  The date of the refusal  was
    19 November 2014.  The sponsor, Mrs  Ruby  Sadiq,  is  the  appellant's
    spouse,.  The parties accepted that the  appellant  could  not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules because the sponsor did not  have  evidence
    of a sufficient income over the necessary period in  order  to  satisfy
    Appendix FM.  As Judge Grimshaw noted [18] the sponsor  was  unable  to
    provide wage slips until January 2014, a period of five months  (rather
    than the required six).  Also, the minimum income threshold  could  not
    be met because the sponsor did not have  paid  employment  in  December
    2013.

 2. The judge went on to consider Article 8 ECHR  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.  She found that the case as "unusual" [22]  the  sponsor  having
    undertaken maternity leave from her  employer  in  September  2012  and
    returned to work in January 2014.  It was not clear to  the  judge  why
    the sponsor had not made a claim for  maternity  allowance  during  her
    absence from work and at [23], the judge wrote:

         Of course, it may very well be that the sponsor had not worked  for
         her current employer for the required period  to  be  eligible  for
         statutory maternity pay.  However, given the totality of  her  work
         history I consider  it  reasonable  to  expect  her  to  have  been
         eligible for maternity allowance from the State  if  not  from  her
         employer.  I bear in mind that if the  sponsor  had  made  a  valid
         claim she would have been entitled to 9/10 of her weekly pay for  a
         period of six weeks.  I estimate that amount to be �1,512 in total.
          When I add that sum to the figure of �8,400 which  she  earned  in
         the five months prior to the application it is evident the  minimum
         income threshold is met.

 3. The judge went on to record that the sponsor had provided a copy of her
    bank  account  showing  her  savings  exceeding  �13,000.   The   judge
    considered that the case might "reasonably be described as exceptional"
    noting that the couple have a genuine and subsisting relationship since
    they married in 2012 and "have had a child together."  The judge stated
    that, "For the reasons given above, I do not doubt that  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM are currently  met."   In  particular,  the
    judge noted that, "If [the sponsor] had [claimed maternity payments] it
    is likely the appellant could show the  minimum  income  threshold  was
    met."  The judge went on to invoke [26] SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387
    and refers to the relevance of "near  miss"  cases  in  assessments  of
    appeals under Article 8 ECHR.  The judge concluded by finding that "The
    requirement for the appellant to complete a fresh application would  be
    a disproportionate response to the legitimate public end  of  fair  and
    effective system of immigration control."

 4. I find that the judge erred in law.  Clearly, it is for the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, adopting  a  robust  attitude  towards  judicial  fact-
    finding,  to  determine  in  any   given   case   whether   exceptional
    circumstances arise.  However, the judge should  not,  in  my  opinion,
    have concluded that such circumstances arose before  properly  applying
    to the facts all relevant  Rules  and  statutory  provisions.   As  the
    grounds  point  out,  there  was  no  reference  made  in  the  judge's
    assessment to section 117B of the 2014  Act.   Furthermore,  the  judge
    arrives at the conclusion that exceptional circumstances exist in  this
    case via a tortuous and highly speculative route; the judge appears  to
    regard this as a  "near  miss"  case  but  only  by  including  in  the
    sponsor's income putative payments in  respect  of  a  maternity  claim
    which the sponsor never actually made.  An exceptional case  should  be
    apparent on the basis of the actual factual matrix before the judge;  I
    cannot see that exceptional circumstances may arise where that  factual
    matrix is based upon pure speculation.

 5. I have no doubt that Judge Grimshaw felt sympathy  for  the  appellant,
    sponsor and their child.  However, for the  reasons  I  have  given,  I
    believe that she erred in law.  I  set  aside  her  decision  and  have
    remade the ECO's refusal.  As  the  parties  acknowledged,  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules must be dismissed.  I acknowledge the  fact
    that the sponsor and appellant are in  a  subsisting  relationship  and
    have a child but these are not  exceptional  circumstances  but  rather
    circumstances fully within the ambit of Appendix FM.  The  sponsor  may
    or may not have been eligible to make a  maternity  payment  claim  the
    fact remains that she did not make one so I have not taken that  factor
    into consideration.  Having proper regard to matters set out in Section
    117 of the 2014 Act and to the public interest arising in this case,  I
    do not consider the decision to refuse the appellant entry clearance as
    to a disproportionate interference with private and family lives of the
    individuals involved.  That finding is underlined  by  the  fact  there
    appears to be no reason why family life between the appellant,  sponsor
    and their child  may  not  carry  on  their  family  life  together  in
    Pakistan.  I therefore dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds also.

Notice of Decision

 6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  31
    July 2015 is set aside.  I have remade the decision.   The  appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Entry  Clearance  Officer  dated  19
    November 2014 is dismissed under the Immigration  Rules  and  on  human
    rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).

 7. No anonymity direction is made.
