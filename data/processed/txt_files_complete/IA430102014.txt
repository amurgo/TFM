Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Gillard, Visa Inn
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal  against  a  decision  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Cheales dismissing  an  appeal  by  the  Appellant  against  a
    refusal to vary leave and a decision to remove  her.   The  appeal  was
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds under
    Article 8.

 2. The Appellant was born on 12th September 1968  and  is  a  national  of
    Kenya.  She has been living in the UK since February 2006.  She arrived
    with leave as a student and this leave was renewed until  August  2014.
    She then applied to remain on the grounds of private life.

 3. The Appellant did not appear before the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  give
    evidence.  On the morning of the hearing a letter from the  Appellant's
    representatives was placed before the judge stating that the  Appellant
    was no longer seeking an oral hearing.  Nevertheless, presumably on the
    basis that the appeal was already listed, the hearing went  ahead  with
    the Respondent represented.  Along with the letter submitted on the day
    of the hearing were two witness statements,  a  skeleton  argument  and
    photographs.

 4.  The  position  of  the  Appellant  is  that  whilst  studying  for   a
    postgraduate diploma she met Mr Michael Sunday Ahmadu, who is a British
    citizen.  The couple spent every weekend together and hoped  to  marry.
    The reason they had not married so far was that they were  waiting  for
    the Appellant's passport to be returned with the grant of a visa.

 5. In her decision the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    Appellant could not meet the private  life  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  The  judge  further  noted  that  the
    Appellant has two children in Kenya from a previous marriage,  as  well
    as her mother and siblings.  She had come to the UK for  the  temporary
    purpose of study without expectation that she would be able to make her
    home here.

 6. The judge then made further observations at paragraphs 12 and 13 of her
    decision.  She pointed out that the application for variation of  leave
    was made on the basis of private life only.  No information  was  given
    on the application form with regard to a partner and the section of the
    form relating to this had "not applicable" written across it.  The form
    was signed on 10th August 2014 with a declaration of truth.  The  judge
    expressed surprise that the Appellant now  stated  that  she  had  been
    engaged to be married since January 2014.  This damaged the Appellant's
    credibility.

 7. The judge continued that no notice had been  given  to  the  Respondent
    that the Appellant had a partner and there was no explanation as to why
    she had not mentioned this in her application or at some earlier  date.
    The judge  then  stated:  "There  is  no  evidence  of  a  genuine  and
    subsisting marriage".  The judge found there was no apparent reason why
    the Appellant could not return to Kenya with her partner.

 8. In relation to Article 8 the judge referred to the case of Nagre [2013]
    EWHC 720 (Admin) to support the proposition that  where  the  Appellant
    did not satisfy paragraph 276ADE it was necessary to consider Article 8
    only if there was "a good arguable case" for a  grant  of  leave  under
    Article 8.  The judge concluded that there was not a good arguable case
    and she would therefore not be considering Article 8.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had
    arguably misdirected herself (a) by not considering Article  8  outside
    the Immigration Rules, and (b) not having regard to Section 117B of the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,   as   inserted   by
    Immigration Act 2014.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me, Mr Gillard  acknowledged  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that the couple were unable to rely on  Appendix  FM  because
    they were not married and had not been cohabiting for two years.  There
    was sufficient evidence of a relationship and a good arguable case  for
    consideration under Article  8  outside  the  Rules.   In  relation  to
    Section 117B, Mr Bramble referred to the cases  of  AM  (s117B)  Malawi
    [2015] UKUT 0260 on when a person's immigration status  was  precarious
    and Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 on the regard to be given  to
    the factors set out in Section 117B.  Mr Bramble submitted  that  there
    was an error of law on the basis that having regard to the evidence  of
    the relationship between the Appellant and her fianc�, there was a need
    for consideration under Article 8 and Section 117B.

11. For the Respondent, Mr Bramble  submitted  that  the  first  issue  was
    whether the judge had erred by failing to consider Article 8 on a stand
    alone basis.  Mr Bramble referred  to  paragraphs  12  and  13  of  the
    decision.  He pointed out that the judge did not have  the  benefit  of
    hearing  the  Appellant  or  her  fianc�  giving  evidence.   When  the
    application for a variation was made in  August  2014  the  section  on
    partners was crossed out and marked as "not applicable".   Consequently
    the judge had concerns about credibility.  It might be  the  case  that
    the section of the application form for a  partner  was  not  completed
    because the Appellant could  not  succeed  under  Appendix  FM  but  Mr
    Bramble questioned whether there was any  explanation  in  relation  to
    this before the judge.  He pointed out that the application  of  August
    2014 was made on the basis of private life only.

12. Mr Bramble acknowledged that at paragraph 13 of the decision the  judge
    referred to there  being  no  evidence  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage.  The word "marriage"  was  clearly  incorrect  and  the  word
    should have  been  "relationship".   No  specific  considerations  were
    raised on behalf of the Appellant that had not been taken into  account
    by the judge  and  there  was  no  necessity  for  the  judge  to  have
    considered the application under Article 8 outside the Rules.

Discussion

13. I have sympathy for the position of the judge.  Only on the day of  the
    hearing was she notified that the parties were  no  longer  seeking  an
    oral hearing and  would  not  be  attending  the  hearing  before  her.
    Clearly as the appeal was already listed and the  Respondent  had  been
    notified of the hearing and was represented, the proper course was  for
    the hearing to proceed.  Nevertheless, the task for the judge  was  not
    made any easier by this last minute notification by the Appellant  that
    she would not be attending.

14. Furthermore, the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal was in February
    2015 and the judge therefore did not have the benefit of  the  decision
    of the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387.   This  case
    makes it clear, in accordance with MM (Lebanon)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985
    that there is no intermediate test to be satisfied as  to  whether  the
    Appellant has a good arguable case before an appeal can  be  considered
    outside the Rules.  In order to succeed outside the Rules the Appellant
    would have to show compelling  circumstances  existed  which  were  not
    sufficiently recognised under the Rules.

15. Mr Bramble's submission was that even if the Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  had  misdirected  herself  on  this  point,  there  were   no
    compelling circumstances which were not considered  by  the  judge  and
    which could have led to the appeal being allowed under Article  8.   On
    the face of it this is a strong argument.  I am, however,  troubled  by
    the statement of the judge at paragraph 13 of the decision  that  there
    was "no evidence of a genuine and subsisting marriage".  As Mr  Bramble
    pointed out, the word marriage is clearly an error and the judge should
    have used the word "relationship".  I do not think this  in  itself  is
    necessarily a material error.  I am more concerned about the use of the
    phrase "no evidence".  In fact the judge did have quite a  considerable
    amount of evidence  before  her  about  the  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and her fianc�.  This comprised witness statements from  each
    of them and photographs.  What the judge may have intended to  say  was
    not that there was "no evidence" but  that  she  did  not  accept  this
    evidence as credible.  This is, however, a different matter.

16. I note that at paragraph 12  the  judge  referred  to  the  Appellant's
    credibility as being damaged because the Appellant had not put  in  her
    application form that she had a partner.  She had crossed this  section
    out and written "not applicable" across it.   For  the  Respondent,  Mr
    Bramble very fairly acknowledged that there was a possibility that this
    was done because the Appellant was aware that  she  could  not  succeed
    under the provisions of Appendix FM relating to partners.   He  pointed
    out, however, that this possible explanation was not before the  judge.



17. Nevertheless it seems that on the basis of the Appellant having crossed
    out the section in the application form relating to partners the  judge
    rejected entirely all  the  evidence  before  her  in  respect  of  the
    Appellant and her fianc�, and, indeed, the relationship  the  Appellant
    claimed to have with her fianc�'s children.  The only meaning which can
    be attributed to the use by the judge of the words "no  evidence  of  a
    genuine and subsisting marriage" in paragraph 13  of  the  decision  is
    that the judge did not believe at all that the Appellant and her fianc�
    were in any relationship.

18. I am not satisfied that the judge has given adequate reasons for making
    a finding to this effect.  The judge has rejected in its  entirety  all
    of the Appellant's evidence about her relationship with her fianc�  and
    has done so on the basis of how the  application  form  was  completed,
    which as Mr Bramble very properly acknowledged, was capable of  bearing
    an explanation which would not damage the Appellant's credibility.

19. As I have already indicated, I have sympathy with the position in which
    the judge found herself on the day of the hearing but at the same  time
    she did not give adequate reasons for rejecting the credibility of  the
    Appellant's evidence about her relationship  with  her  fianc�.   I  am
    satisfied this amounts to an error of law.

20. I accept that this is not the error of law which was argued  before  me
    by Mr Gillard.  There is a  connection,  however,  with  the  arguments
    which Mr Gillard put to me.  If the judge had made a proper finding  to
    the effect that there was no relationship between the Appellant and her
    fianc� then, indeed, the judge would not have been required to consider
    Article 8 outside the Rules.  There would  have  been  an  insufficient
    evidential basis to  show  that  an  assessment  under  Article  8  was
    required.  Where, however, the judge made a finding that there  was  no
    relationship but did not  give  adequate  reasons  for  this,  then  in
    consequence her finding that there was no need to  consider  Article  8
    outside the Rules must also be mistaken as it was based on the  earlier
    error as to whether there was evidence  of  a  relationship.   Had  the
    judge  properly  approached  the  question  of  the  existence   of   a
    relationship between the Appellant and her fianc�, and found that there
    was a relationship, then it  would  have  been  proper  to  proceed  to
    consider Article 8 outside the Rules.

21. In view of the judge's error the proper course  is  to  set  aside  her
    decision and   remit  the  appeal  for  hearing  before  a  differently
    constituted First-tier Tribunal.  It does not follow from this that the
    Appellant will succeed, either under the  Immigration  Rules  or  under
    Article 8, but proper findings should  be  made  as  a  basis  for  any
    decision on the extent of the Appellant's Article 8 rights.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  afresh  before  a
judge other than Judge Cheales.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for  anonymity.   I  have  not
been asked to make such an order and I  see  no  reasons  of  substance  for
doing so.
