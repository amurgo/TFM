Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    None


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.  The Claimant, a national of
    Sri Lanka, date of birth 28 February 1981, appealed against  the  ECO's
    decision to refuse to grant entry clearance under paragraph 319L of the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (the Rules).  On 20 August  2014  her  out  of
    country appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  A  C  Moler  (the
    judge) who, in a decision dated 3 July 2015, allowed the  appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules on the basis that the Claimant had satisfied  the
    criteria for entry clearance under paragraph 319L of the Rules.

2.   Accordingly, the ECO sought permission to appeal the  judge's  decision
    and  on  25  September  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  gave
    permission to appeal. For reasons given by  me  in  a  decision  on  13
    November 2015 I found that the Original Tribunal's decision  could  not
    stand and that the judge had erred in finding that the Claimant had met
    the requirements of paragraph 319L of the Rules.

3.   At that hearing on 4 November 2015 it became apparent  that  there  had
    been  a  residual  claim  with  reference  to  Article   8.    In   the
    circumstances I decided that there  may  be  exceptional  circumstances
    enabling the case to be looked at outside the  Rules  under  Article  8
    ECHR.  My conclusion was not intended to  be  encouraging  so  much  as
    reflecting the position which had actually arisen albeit the judge  had
    decided not to deal with it.

4.   Accordingly, I gave directions that any further documents,  bearing  in
    mind that it was an out of country appeal and  the  relevant  date  for
    consideration  was  the  date  of  the  ECO's  decision,  that  further
    documents could be served and should be served not less than 10 working
    days before the further hearing on that Article 8 ECHR issue.

5.   No such material has been forthcoming from either the Claimant  or  the
    ECO.

6.   I, for my own part, considered the papers and did not find evidence  to
    support an out of country application in effect based on Article 8  for
    entry into the United Kingdom, in particular I had regard to  the  case
    of SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550.  On the case file in a letter sent
    by fax dated 15 March 2016  in  which  the  Tamil  Welfare  Association
    (Newham) wrote to the Tribunal in  terms  that  they  were  seeking  to
    withdraw their appeal.  It is unclear whether the  representatives  had
    confused the fact that the Claimant  was  not  now  the  Appellant  but
    rather the Respondent to the ECO's appeal or whether it was essentially
    seeking to withdraw the appeal against the  original  decision  of  the
    ECO.

7.   In any event, I caused enquiries to be made  by  the  Tribunal  of  the
    Claimant's  representatives who confirmed that they were not attending,
    that the Claimant was aware of the hearing but they did not think would
    be attending and when the case was called for hearing it is  clear  the
    Claimant had not attended for the hearing today.

8.   The Tribunal on receiving the request to withdraw  the  appeal  by  the
    Claimant's representative wrote drawing attention to the fact  that  it
    was the ECO's appeal and not the Claimant's and indicating how the case
    might be dealt with.

9.   In the circumstances, having looked at the papers I do  not  find  that
    there was either at the date of decision or even  now,  material  which
    went to show that Article 8 ECHR was engaged.  In  those  circumstances
    absence of  submissions  and  evidence  relating  to  the  same  I  was
    satisfied that this aspect of the case should have  been  dismissed  by
    the Original Tribunal and in any event on the material before me has no
    substance.

Decision
10.   Accordingly  the  ECO's  appeal  is  allowed  against   the   original
    Tribunal's decision.  The appeal by Mr Navarathinarasa  (the  Claimant)
    with reference to Article 8 ECHR grounds is dismissed.

Fee Award

11.  A fee had been paid  in the sum  of  ï¿½140  and  the  appeal  ultimately
    having been  lost by the Claimant no award is appropriate.

Anonymity

12.  No anonymity order has previously been made nor  is  one  necessary  or
    required.
