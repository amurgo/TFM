JUDGE SMITH:

 1. This is an application for judicial review of the Secretary of  State's
    decision dated 2 July 2014 refusing the Applicants leave to  remain  as
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants  ("the  Decision").   The  Decision  was
    maintained following a Pre-Action Protocol Letter.  The judicial review
    proceedings have a somewhat convoluted history.  Permission was refused
    by this Tribunal on the papers and following an oral hearing  but  then
    granted by Lord Justice Davis in the Court of Appeal, on the papers, on
    the basis that the Decision  was  harsh  and  technical.   The  parties
    agreed to remit the substantive judicial review to  this  Tribunal  for
    hearing and so it is that it comes before me.

 2. The Applicants are from Pakistan.  They are brothers.  Jointly they are
    a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  team  operating  a  company  called   KSoft
    Technologies Limited.  They have previously been in the UK as  students
    and then  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrants.   They  made  a  first
    application for leave to remain as Tier 1  (Entrepreneurs)  on  16  May
    2013 which was refused and eventually dismissed on  appeal.   Meanwhile
    they made a further application on 15 April 2014 which  was  eventually
    refused on 2 July 2014 leading to the Decision under challenge in  this
    judicial review.  The Respondent refused the application on  the  basis
    that the Applicants could not show that they had �50,000  available  to
    them to invest in the  business  in  a  way  which  complied  with  the
    requirements for specified evidence in Appendix A  to  the  Immigration
    Rules ("the Rules").

 3. The Applicants relied on money shown as being held in a  business  bank
    account in the name  of  the  company  in  the  sum  of  �50,047.77  or
    thereabouts in the relevant period.  The  Respondent  makes  the  point
    that the Applicants are required to show one of two things: either that
    they have that money available to invest or that they have invested  it
    within the last twelve months and, if so, the source of that investment
    whether by way of purchase of shares or directors' loans.  The evidence
    shows only that the money is already in the company's bank account  but
    does not show the source.  The application was therefore  said  not  to
    satisfy paragraph (d) of Table 4 or paragraphs 41 or 46 of  Appendix  A
    of the Rules, although that is not the way in  which  it  is  expressly
    formulated.

 4. Dr Staker accepts that the Decision is  somewhat  vague  and  does  not
    spell out the Respondent's reasons in any detail.   Mr  Fripp  confirms
    however that the Applicants do not take any point on  the  adequacy  of
    reasons.  They rely solely on the issue as to  whether  the  Applicants
    meet paragraph 41 and 41-SD of the Appendix A to the Rules as they  say
    they do.  The Applicants expressly abandon ground two of their judicial
    review grounds in relation to the exercise  of  discretion.   Mr  Fripp
    confirms that there is no reliance either  on  evidential  flexibility.
    The Applicants say that on the sensible, natural meaning  of  paragraph
    41 they meet that Rule.  Mr Fripp says that it is  the  Respondent  who
    seeks to place a purposive and strained  interpretation  on  the  Rules
    which is unnecessary and impermissible.

 5. Mr Fripp also says that the Applicants are genuine  entrepreneurs.   No
    point is taken by the Respondent in the decision  in  relation  to  the
    genuineness of their business and they have  qualifications  which  are
    relevant to that business.  Dr Staker says  that  this  should  not  be
    taken to be accepted as the Applicants failed under the Rules for other
    reasons so the Respondent has yet to reach any view on the  genuineness
    and viability of the business.  That would be for another day if I find
    that the Applicants' interpretation of the Rules is correct.  This is a
    judicial review so that, if I accept the Applicants' case, the decision
    should be quashed and remitted.  Mr Fripp does not disagree  with  that
    proposition.

 6.  With  that  introduction  I  turn  to  the  application  made  by  the
    Applicants, the substance of the Decision and the relevant Rules.

 7. The application made by the Applicants is squarely on  the  basis  that
    the money available to them has yet to be  invested  in  the  business.
    This is essential to their argument.   In  the  application  form  they
    ticked the box to the effect that they have not already invested all or
    part of the funds in a UK business.  In relation to the funds  said  to
    be available to them they rely on a letter from Barclays Bank and  bank
    statements.  The letter on which they rely is one dated 12  April  2014
    from Barclays Bank PLC addressed to the  Directors  KSoft  Technologies
    Limited and giving the company's address of incorporation.  The  letter
    itself is addressed  as   "Dear  Mr  Kasim  and  Mr  Baqir"  (i.e.  the
    Applicants) and states as follows:

         "Further to a recent request  for  a  certificate  of  balance  the
         information you require is as follows:

         Name: [that is the account name]:   KSoft Technologies Limited"

    There then follows the sort code and account number and confirmation of
    the account balance which at close of business on  11  April  2014  was
    �50,039.77.

 8. There is also a letter dated 28 March 2014 from  Barclays  Bank,  again
    addressed to the directors and welcoming them to Business Banking.  The
    account statement on which reliance is placed also shows the  directors
    of KSoft Technologies Limited as the addressees but the account is very
    clearly in the  name  of  KSoft  Technologies  Limited  and  I  do  not
    understand the Applicants to dispute that.  Mr Fripp accepts  therefore
    that the Applicants are individuals who as directors of the company are
    agents of that company and that the money is held by a limited company.
     That money therefore belongs to the company and not to the  Applicants
    themselves.

 9. The Decision insofar as it relates to the issue which is at  the  heart
    of this case reads as follows:

         "You have claimed 25 points for access to funds under Appendix A of
         the Immigration Rules but on the basis of the  documents  you  have
         provided you do not qualify for the award of points in this area.

         The reasons for this decision are detailed below.

         You have stated that you have access to at least  �50,000  held  in
         your own name and that of your  entrepreneur  partner  Mr  Muhammad
         Baqir to invest in business in the UK as specified under  provision
         (d) in Table 4 of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

         You have also stated on your application form at question  G5  that
         you have not invested any  of  the  funds  but  from  the  evidence
         provided i.e. Business bank account, a Share Certificate  and  HMRC
         CT41G, this shows that you have.

         However, this evidence does not meet the criteria  specified  under
         Appendix A of the Immigration Rules because it does not state  your
         name and the name of your entrepreneurial team partner and you have
         not supplied any audited/unaudited accounts to show the  investment
         by way of shares as per paragraph 46-SD(a).

         Therefore the evidence that you have submitted does not satisfy the
         requirement  of  Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and   in
         accordance with paragraph 41 of the same, you are not considered to
         have access to the funds that you have claimed.

         Therefore, we are unable to award points  for  this  attribute,  in
         accordance with Appendix A of the Immigration Rules."

     I pause to observe that the decision also refuses 25 points under  each
    of "Funds  held  in  a  regulated  financial  institution"  and  "Funds
    disposable in the United Kingdom".  However the argument was  addressed
    to the access to funds issue and if the Applicants are not entitled  to
    25 points in that regard then they cannot  succeed  in  any  event.   I
    should also mention that the above records the Decision in relation  to
    one of the Applicants. The Decision in relation to the other is in like
    form although of course the names are transposed.

10. As many Judges have observed, the PBS Rules are  highly  technical  and
    often  difficult  to  follow.   However  in  this  case  the  issue  is
    relatively narrow.  It is accepted by both parties  that  in  order  to
    meet the Rules in relation to this aspect,  at  least  those  Rules  in
    place at the  date  of  application  or  Decision  in  this  case,  the
    Applicants must satisfy either paragraph 41 or 45/46 of Appendix A with
    the relevant evidential requirements which apply to  those  paragraphs.
    Helpfully Mr Fripp also concedes that based on the documents  submitted
    by the Applicants they  cannot  meet  the  evidential  requirements  of
    paragraph 46-SD and accordingly the issue is narrower still and focuses
    on whether the Applicants can meet paragraph 41 and 41-SD.

11. Before turning to those paragraphs however it is necessary to  set  out
    the overarching paragraphs of the Rules to which I  was  taken.   Those
    start  with  the  provisions  of  the  Rules   relating   to   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrants.  Paragraph 245D is  headed  "Purpose  of  this
    route and meaning of business" and states (so far as relevant here):

         "..........

         (c): Where paragraphs 245D to 245DF and  paragraphs  35  to  53  of
         Appendix A, refer to money remaining  available  to  the  applicant
         until such time as it is spent for the purposes of his business  or
         businesses:

         (i)  'Available' means that the funds are:

             (1)  in the applicant's own possession;

             (2)  in the financial accounts of a UK  incorporated  business
                  of which he is the director, or

             (3)  available from the third party or parties  named  in  the
                  application under the terms of the declaration referred to
                  in paragraph 41-SD(b) of Appendix A.

         (ii) 'Spent' excludes spending on:

             (1)  the applicant's own remuneration;

             (2)  buying the business from a previous owner where the money
                  goes to that previous owner rather than into the business;

             (3)  investing in other businesses, and

             (4)  any spending which is not directly for  the  purposes  of
                  establishing or running the applicant's  own  business  or
                  businesses."

12. I move on then to paragraph 245DD which sets out the  requirements  for
    leave  to  remain.   Under  this  category  245DD(b)  states  that  the
    applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs 35 to 53 of
    Appendix A. That is the provision with which I am concerned.

13. Moving on to 245DD(h) the Rules provide that except where the applicant
    has, or was last granted, leave as  a  Tier  2  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    which does not apply here the Secretary  of  State  must  be  satisfied
    that:

         "(i) ...

          (ii)    the  applicant  genuinely  intends  to  invest  the  money
             referred to in Table 4  of  Appendix  A  in  the  business  or
             businesses referred to in (i);

         (iii)    the money  referred  to  in  Table  4  of  Appendix  A  is
             genuinely available to the applicant and will remain available
             to him until such time as it is spent for the purposes of  his
             business or businesses."

14. Moving on then to Appendix A which is the focus  of  this  application,
    Table 4 of Appendix A contains the provision that in order to  gain  25
    points for access to funds the applicant has to have access to not less
    than �50,000 from one or more of the sources stated in that table.

15. Under paragraph 41 of Appendix A which is headed "Investment: notes" it
    is stated as follows:

         "An applicant will only be considered to have access to funds if:

         (a)  The specified documents in paragraph  41-SD  are  provided  to
             show cash money to the amount required (this must  not  be  in
             the form of assets);

         (b)  the specified documents in paragraph  41-SD  are  provided  to
             show that the applicant has permission to  use  the  money  to
             invest in a business in the UK;

         (c)   the  money  is  either  held  in  a  UK  regulated  financial
             institution or is transferable to the UK; and

         (d)  the money will remain available to the  applicant  until  such
             time as it is  spent  for  the  purposes  of  the  applicant's
             business or businesses.  The Secretary of State  reserves  the
             right to request further evidence......."

    Paragraph 41-SD then continues as follows:

         "The specified documents in Table 4 and paragraph 41 and associated
         definitions are as follows:

         (a)  Where this paragraph refers to funding being available, unless
             stated  otherwise,  this  means  funding  available  to:   [my
             emphasis]

             (i)  the applicant;

             (ii) the entrepreneurial team, if  the  applicant  is  relying
                  under the provisions in paragraph 52 of this Appendix, and

             (iii)    the applicant's business." [Mr Fripp's emphasis]

             [41-SD(b) is not relevant but I observe the reference  to  the
             applicant's name as it appears on the application  form  as  a
             director which is the situation here].

         "(c) The specified  documents  to  show  evidence  of  the  funding
             available to invest whether from the applicant's own funds  or
             from one or  more  third  parties  are  one  or  more  of  the
             following specified documents: [my emphasis]

                i) a letter from  each  financial  institution  holding  the
                   funds to confirm the amount  of  money  available.   Each
                   letter must:

                   ....................

                  (6)  state the applicant's name  and  his  team  partner's
                      name where relevant;

                  (9)  confirm  the  amount  of  money  available  from  the
                      applicant's own funds (if applicable) that  are  held
                      in that institution [my emphasis],

                  (10)  for  money  available  from  any  third  party   (if
                      applicable) that is held in that institution, confirm
                      that the third party has informed the institution  of
                      the amount of money it intends to make available, and
                      that the institution is not aware of the third  party
                      having promised to make that money available  to  any
                      other person;

                  .........; or

             (ii) for money held in the UK only, a recent personal bank  or
                  building  society  statement  from   each   UK   financial
                  institution holding the funds which confirms the amount of
                  money  available.   Each  statement   must   satisfy   the
                  following requirements:

                  ...............

                  (4)  The account must be in the applicant's own name  only
                      (or both names for an entrepreneurial  team)  not  in
                      the name of a business or third party." [my emphasis]

16. Although as I have already noted the Applicants accept that they cannot
    satisfy 46-SD since this is in part  the  basis  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's Decision, I refer to paragraphs 45 and 46 of Appendix  A  which
    are as follows:

         "45. If the applicant has invested the money referred to in Table 4
             in the UK before the date of the application, points  will  be
             awarded for funds available as if the applicant  had  not  yet
             invested the funds, providing the investment was made no  more
             than 12 months before the date  of  application.....  and  the
             specified documents in paragraph 46-SD are provided."

    Paragraph  46  states  under  the  heading  "Investment  and   business
activity: notes":

         "46. Documentary evidence must  be  provided  in  all  cases.   The
             specified documents in paragraph 46-SD  must  be  provided  as
             evidence of any investment and  business  activity  that  took
             place when the applicant had leave as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
             Migrant  or  a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant  and  any
             investment made no more than 12 months.... before the date  of
             the application for which the applicant is claiming points."

    Then for  completeness  46-SD  sets  out  the  specified  documents  in
    paragraphs 45 and 46 which are as follows:

         "(a) the applicant  must  provide  all  the  appropriate  specified
             documents needed to establish  the  amount  of  money  he  has
             invested from the following list:

             (i)  if the applicant's business is a registered company  that
                  is required  to  produce  audited  accounts,  the  audited
                  accounts must be provided;

             (ii) if the applicant's business is not  required  to  produce
                  audited accounts, unaudited accounts...

               ii) if the applicant has made the investment in the form of a
                   director's loan, it must be shown in the relevant set  of
                   accounts provided and the applicant must also  provide  a
                   legal agreement between the applicant (in the  name  that
                   appears on his application) and the company...."

    There is then a requirement as to what those documents must show  which
    is not relevant because the Applicants accept that such documents  were
    not produced.

17. As I have already noted the Applicants accept that they cannot  satisfy
    paragraph 46-SD.  They provided share  certificates  but  no  unaudited
    accounts which show that  they  made  a  financial  investment  in  the
    company for  which  those  shares  were  consideration  nor  have  they
    provided any evidence of a loan  agreement  recording  that  they  have
    loaned the money to the company.  That is the point being made  in  the
    Decision  which  led  to  an  argument  in  earlier  stages  of   these
    proceedings which turned out to be something of  a  red  herring  about
    whether what was at issue was the money in  the  bank  account  or  the
    share certificates showing the Applicants'  holdings  in  the  company.
    The arguments before me today have clearly focused on the money in  the
    business bank account as being the matter which  is  in  dispute.   The
    fact that the requisite �50,000 is in the (business)  bank  account  is
    not in dispute; it is a question of how the Rules apply to that fact.

18. I turn then  back  to  paragraph  41-SD.   Mr  Fripp's  argument  is  a
    relatively simple one.  He says that at 41-SD(a) a reference  to  funds
    being available includes funds available to the  Applicants'  business.
    He says that  the  money  in  the  company's  bank  account  are  funds
    available to the business.  Everything else which  follows  has  to  be
    read in that context.  That is not though the way  in  which  the  Rule
    reads.  True it is that 41-SD(a) refers to funds being available to the
    business.  However what is important for the purpose of  this  Rule  is
    the source of the funds.  That is the purpose  of  41-SD(c)  where  the
    specified documents are set out.  41-SD(c)  is  quite  clear  that  the
    evidence of funding available to invest  has  to  be  either  from  the
    Applicants' own funds or from a third party.  That is  consistent  with
    what follows.  Mr Fripp  relies  on  41-SD(c)(i)(6)  in  particular  as
    showing that the letter from Barclays  states  the  name  of  both  the
    entrepreneurial team members.  It does but that is only in the  context
    of their role as directors of the  company.  That  is  not  as  account
    holders.  This is not the account of a partnership or sole  trader.  It
    is the bank account of a limited company.  41-SD(c)(i)(9)  is  entirely
    inconsistent with  Mr  Fripp's  argument  unless  "applicant"  in  that
    context can be read as including the business.  I do not understand  Mr
    Fripp to argue with the fact that the "applicants" in this case are the
    two individuals who are seeking leave to remain  and  not  the  limited
    company.

19. Mr Fripp also points to 41-SD(c)(ii)(4) which he says  shows  that  his
    interpretation of what precedes it must  be  correct.   That  paragraph
    draws a distinction between an account in the applicant's own  name  or
    both names of a team, not in the name of a  business.   Mr  Fripp  says
    that if the draughtsman had intended that funds from a  business  could
    not be included in 41-SD(c) he or she would have said so.  However,  Mr
    Fripp's argument overlooks one fundamental point.  In 41-SD(a) what  is
    being considered is the funding being available to a person or business
    whereas 41-SD(c) is concerned with funding  coming  from  a  particular
    person or source.  In 41-SD(a) for example it is important that funding
    might be available to the business itself rather than to the  applicant
    himself if, for example, money is being provided by a  venture  capital
    company.  That is why 41-SD(a) reads as it does.  It is  also  why  41-
    SD(c) deals in  much  greater  detail  with  the  documents  which  are
    required to prove the source of the funds.  That is what  concerns  the
    Secretary of State  in  terms  of  whether  the  funding  is  genuinely
    available.  If 41-SD(a)  stood  alone  Mr  Fripp's  argument  might  be
    sustainable but it does not.  It has to be read in the context  of  the
    Rule as a whole.  Paragraph 41-SD read as a whole cannot  be  construed
    in the way in which he contends.

20. I did not completely follow Dr Staker's submission that the  Respondent
    relies on 41-SD(c)(ii) and not 41-SD(c)(i) because the funds are in the
    UK.  Paragraph 41-SD(c)(i) and (ii) are  in  the  alternative  and  41-
    SD(c)(i) does not apparently draw a distinction on the basis  of  where
    the funds are held.  However, whichever of  those  sub-sections  apply,
    for the reasons I  have  stated,  the  Applicants  cannot  meet  either
    provision.

21. There are two other subsidiary arguments with which I will deal shortly
    in light of the reasons I have already given.  The first  concerns  the
    definition of "available" and  "spent"  at  paragraph  245D(c)  of  the
    Rules.  This is a point on which Dr  Staker  relied  in  particular  in
    relation to the definition of "spent".  As canvassed with Mr  Fripp  in
    reply, at first blush the reference by Dr Staker to the  definition  of
    "available" does not assist the Respondent as it may  tend  to  suggest
    that funds held in the business bank  account  are  available  and  are
    therefore included within the definition.

22. Dr Staker says that "financial accounts" in that definition  mean  only
    audited or unaudited accounts of the business and that  the  definition
    is consistent with paragraph 46-SD which requires  production  of  such
    accounts.  Whether or not that is the meaning of financial accounts,  I
    do not think that can be read as a reference to paragraph 46-SD because
    that paragraph is concerned with money which has been invested and  not
    money which remains available.  The answer to these definitions  is  to
    be found in my view when the reference to "a UK incorporated  business"
    in 245D(i)(1) is contrasted with the reference  to  "the  business"  in
    245D(ii)(2).  It is not intended to be a reference to the business into
    which the investment is to be made but rather another  UK  incorporated
    business with which  the  applicant  is  involved.   For  example,  the
    applicant may already be the director  of  one  company  and  may  seek
    perhaps to take over another company via the company  in  which  he  is
    already involved.

23. For that reason I do not need to decide whether financial  accounts  is
    to be read, as Dr Staker suggests, as being only the  company  accounts
    (ie balance sheet and  profit  and  loss  account)  and  not  the  bank
    accounts or whether, as Mr Fripp suggests,  it  can  include  the  bank
    account which is financial in nature.  If I had to  decide  that  issue
    though I would prefer Dr  Staker's  submission  that  it  is  only  the
    company accounts.  "Financial accounts"  of  an  incorporated  business
    tends to have a specialist meaning and  the  natural  meaning  in  this
    context is therefore as the company accounts and not the bank  account.
    In the end though I derive little assistance from this and it is not my
    understanding that  the  Respondent  relied  on  this  section  in  her
    Decision.

24. The second other argument concerns the  source  of  the  funds  in  the
    company's bank accounts.  As Dr Staker points out, the balance in those
    bank accounts at the date of application was only  some  �50  over  the
    �50,000 threshold.  He points out that  at  least  one  credit  on  the
    evidence shows that the source of the funds was from  business  trading
    and not from investment by or on behalf of the  Applicants.   Mr  Fripp
    says that monies derived from someone to whom the business has provided
    a service are still investment.  I disagree.  The Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
    Rules are clearly concerned with migrants who have a large sum of money
    to invest in a business which they will operate in the UK whether  that
    sum of money derives from their own funds or from a third party such as
    a venture capital firm.  Whilst it is  no  doubt  permissible  for  the
    Applicants to invest money which they have  derived  from  working  for
    others in  their  capacity  as  post-study  migrants,  money  which  is
    generated by trading via the business itself is not investment;  it  is
    trading.  That is why there is a distinction between the heading in the
    Rules for paragraph 41 and that for paragraph 46.

25. I turn finally to look again at the Respondent's Decision since this is
    a judicial review and not an  appeal.   The  Decision  as  fairly  read
    against the interpretation I have set out above is  now  evident.   The
    Respondent understood that the Applicants were making an application on
    the basis that the  funds  were  available  to  them  to  invest.   The
    Respondent also  points  out  that  the  Applicants  indicated  on  the
    application form that they had not invested money.  However,  factually
    they had, as the source of funds relied upon was money held in  a  bank
    account in the name of a business, a limited  company  and  a  separate
    legal entity.  On the ordinary natural meaning of whether  those  funds
    were available or already invested, I have  no  difficulty  in  finding
    that the Respondent was entitled to decide that they had  already  been
    invested.  Once those monies were in the  business  bank  account  they
    were a current asset of  the  business.   They  were  no  longer  funds
    available from the Applicants' own accounts and it clearly could not be
    said that the funds came from investment by a third party. The business
    could not be a third party in relation to funds invested  into  itself.
    Mr Fripp did not argue that it  could.   Accordingly  the  Respondent's
    analysis that paragraph 41 could  not  be  satisfied  was  lawful  even
    though I accept that the Decision does not  refer to  paragraph  41  in
    terms.

26. The Respondent went on (no doubt in the exercise of her discretion)  to
    consider whether the application could nonetheless satisfy paragraph 46
    which she accepts could apply.  As I have already noted the  Applicants
    accept that they could not meet paragraph 46-SD and  there  can  be  no
    challenge therefore to the Respondent's Decision that  the  application
    could not satisfy that rule.  For all of those reasons the Respondent's
    Decision was lawful and this application for judicial review fails.

Costs

27. The Applicants are jointly and severally liable to pay the Respondent's
    costs of the proceedings in  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Costs  are  to  be
    assessed if not agreed.

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

28. Mr Fripp seeks permission to appeal on the basis that this is  a  point
    of some importance.  The  PBS  Rules  are  recognised  as  being  quite
    complex and he is not aware of any case which turns  on  the  point  at
    issue in this particular case.  He also points out  that  Lord  Justice
    Davis found the judicial review to be arguable.  Whatever the views  of
    Lord Justice Davis on the grounds put before him I have  explained  the
    reasons for my decision.  There is no arguable error  in  my  decision.
    If this is thought to be a point of some broader importance that should
    be for the Court of Appeal to determine.  I therefore refuse permission
    to appeal.
