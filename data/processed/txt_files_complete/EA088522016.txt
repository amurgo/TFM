For the Appellant:      Mr. C. Law of counsel
For the Respondent:     Mr. P. Singh, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, who was born on 19 March 1962, is a national  of  China.
    On 12 September 2005 the Appellant applied for an  EEA  Residence  Card
    and one was issued on 28 October 2005.  She  applied  for  another  EEA
    Residence Card, which was issued on 25 January 2011. She  then  applied
    for permanent residence on 25 January 2016.

2.   Her application was refused on 15 July 2016 on the basis that  she  had
    not  provided  any  evidence  that  her  Portuguese  partner  had  been
    exercising a Treaty right  between  April  2011  and  April  2014.  The
    Respondent accepted that there was a P60 for  the  Appellant's  partner
    for the year ending 5 April 2015 and a wage slip, dated 1 January 2016.

3.   The Appellant appealed against this decision on 21 July  2016  and  she
    attached a letter from HM Revenue & Customs, dated 12 March 2015, and a
    P60 for the year ending  5  April  2016  and  explained  that  she  had
    forgotten  to  include  the  necessary  evidence  when  she  made   her
    application. Her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Obhi  on
    the papers on 28 September 2016 and the Judge appeared to  dismiss  her
    appeal in a decision and reasons promulgated on 25 October 2016.

4.   The Appellant appealed against this decision on  7  November  2016  and
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Easterman granted her permission to appeal on
    27 February 2017. He noted that the content of the decision had all the
    hallmarks of a simple error, with the  Judge  intending  to  allow  the
    appeal then stating that it was dismissed.

ORAL HEARING

5.   Counsel for the Appellant stated that  he  relied  on  the  grounds  of
    appeal and submitted that that the Judge had made a  slip  of  the  pen
    when  dismissing  the  appeal,  as  the  Appellant  had  satisfied  the
    requirements for a grant of permanent residence.

6.    In  response,  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  submitted   the
    documents required by previous directions and  stated  that  he  agreed
    with counsel for the Appellant.

THE ERROR OF LAW DECISION


7.   The Appellant needed to show that her partner had been  exercising  his
    Treaty rights, as a worker, between 25 January 2011 and 25 January 2016
    in order to meet the requirements of regulation 15 of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

8.   There was a letter from HM Revenue &  Customs,  dated  12  March  2015.
    This confirmed that the Appellant's partner had been working during the
    years ending 5 April 2011, 5 April 2012, 5 April 2013 and 5 April 2014.
    In addition, there were P60s for the years ending 5 April  2015  and  5
    April 2016.

9.   In paragraph 17 of her decision and reasons First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Obhi stated that she was minded to  allow  the  Appellant's  appeal  as
    there was just one issue between the parties,  which  was  whether  the
    Appellant's  partner  had  been  exercising  a  Treaty  right  for  the
    necessary period of time. She noted that the letter from HMRC  set  out
    the earnings and  tax  paid  since  2008  and  the  P60s  provided  the
    information for the necessary period not covered by this letter.

10.  As a consequence, on the one  issue  between  the  parties,  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Obhi found in favour of the Appellant. It is also  clear
    from paragraph 18 of her decision and reasons that the only reason  why
    she did not award costs against the Respondent was that  the  Appellant
    had accepted that she had forgotten to submit  some  of  the  necessary
    documents when she made her application.

11.  It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made an  error  of  fact
    when she stated in her decision paragraph that she  had  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal.  The circumstances in which an error of  law  could
    amount to an error of law  were  discussed  in  R  (Iran)  &  Others  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  982.  In
    paragraph 28 Lord Justice Brooke considered when an appellate body like
    the IAT, whose primary role during the relevant period  was  restricted
    to identifying  and  correcting  errors  of  law,  could  entertain  an
    argument to the effect that the outcome in the lower court was  unfair,
    as a result of a mistake of fact, and that this constituted an error of
    law which entitled it to interfere.

12.  In paragraph 29 he also reminded himself of the decision in E and  R  v
    Home Secretary [2004] EWCA Civ 49 and accepted that the Tribunal  could
    interfere where common law fairness demanded  it  did  so  and  when  a
    minister has taken a decision on the basis  of  a  foundation  of  fact
    which was demonstrably wrong. At paragraph 64 of that case Carnwath  LJ
    said that there was a  common  feature  of  all  the  cases  previously
    referred to which may be when the  Secretary  of  State  had  a  shared
    interest with both the particular appellant and with  any  tribunal  or
    other decision-maker that might be involved in  the  case  in  ensuring
    that decisions were taken on the best information and  on  the  correct
    factual basis. At paragraph 66 he identified asylum law as representing
    a statutory context in which the parties  shared  an  interest  in  co-
    operating to achieve a correct result but went on to state that he  was
    not laying down a precise code.

13.  I find that the same  principle  applies  in  other  migration  related
    cases. For these reasons I find that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Obhi
    made a clear error of fact in her decision and reasons  which  amounted
    to a material error of law.

DECISION ON ERROR LAW

14.  The appeal is allowed.

15.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Obhi's decision and reasons is set aside.

16.  The appeal is retained in the Upper Tribunal.


THE RE-HEARING

17.  Both parties agreed that it would be in the interests  of  justice  for
    me to retain the appeal in the Upper Tribunal and make  a  decision  on
    the evidence before me.

18.  I have taken into account the documents which were in my file and  have
    noted  that  the  one  issue  between  the  parties  was  whether   the
    Appellant's  partner  had  been  exercising  a  Treaty  right  for  the
    necessary five-year period. As noted above, there was a letter from  HM
    Revenue & Customs, dated  12  March  2015,  which  confirmed  that  the
    Appellant's partner had been working in the United Kingdom  during  the
    years ending 5 April 2011, 5 April 2012, 5 April 2013 and 5 April 2014.
    In addition, there were P60s for the years ending 5 April  2015  and  5
    April 2016. The Respondent had accepted that the Appellant was a member
    of the sponsor's family and she had been entitled to a  residence  card
    as his dependent since 28 October 2005.  As a consequence, I find  that
    she has qualified for a permanent right of residence for  the  purposes
    of  rule  15(1)(b)  of  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006.

DECISION ON RE-HEARING

19.  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.
