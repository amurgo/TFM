Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J McGirr, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Akindele, Solicitor, JDS Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The  appellant  (hereafter  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer   or   ECO)
    challenges the decision of (FtT) Judge Lang sent on 30  September  2015
    allowing the appeal of the respondent (hereafter the claimant)  against
    a decision refusing to grant him leave to enter  as  a  person  with  a
    right of abode. The judge dismissed the appeal under s.2(1)(a)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971 but allowed it on human rights grounds.

2.   The principal ground of challenge  is  that  the  positive  credibility
    findings made by the judge concerning the relationship of the  claimant
    to the sponsor and his wife was perverse. I am entirely satisfied  that
    this ground is made out. The unchallenged history  to  the  appellant's
    application was that a previous application had been made on the  basis
    that he was the natural son of the sponsor and his wife  but  that  was
    refused because DNA tests commissioned by the Home  Office  had  proved
    negative. An application was then made on the basis that the  sponsor's
    wife had genuinely believed she was pregnant and  that  she  had  given
    birth to the claimant. Her claim was that as a result  of  unsuccessful
    IVF treatment she had sought help from a herbalist who had treated  her
    and also told her to avoid any check-ups in the UK (she was in  the  UK
    until  three days before the delivery in Nigeria).   Her  evidence  was
    that a deception had been practised on her by hospital staff or  "Child
    Factory" people who asked the sponsor SOA to leave the  delivery  room.
    She had been told she had given birth to twins, one of  whom  had  died
    and the other was the appellant.

3.   The material findings of the judge were set out at paragraph 38-39.

         "38.   Before  considering  the  issues  raised   by   'exceptional
             circumstances' and Article 8 I address the  doubts  raised  on
             credibility by the respondent. These are set out in  paragraph
             18 above.  Neither  the  respondent  nor  the  appellant  have
             produced  anything   which   might   put   the   circumstances
             concerning the birth of the  appellant  in  context.   On  the
             surface it appears improbable that a woman would be  persuaded
             that she was pregnant and had given birth  to  twins.  However
             sham  pregnancies  are  not  unknown  and  medication   herbal
             remedies can mimic pregnancy.  I accept that SOA and SAA  were
             desperate to have  a  second  child,  there  is  produced  the
             correspondence and invoices relating to IVF treatment in  both
             2004 and 2009, the costs are in excess of ï¿½7,000 (P. 23-29  of
             the appellant's  bundle).   On  a  low  income  this  shows  a
             considerable commitment to achieving  pregnancy.  When  people
             are desperate they sometimes make decisions and  act  in  ways
             which  appear  irrational.  Having  heard  SOA  and  read  the
             handwritten letter of SAA at p.8-10 I accept  that  a  'herbal
             remedy' carried out in  Nigeria   genuinely  seemed  a  viable
             option.


         39.  On what I have been told in oral evidence and what is set  out
             in the various statements  I  consider  it  is  impossible  to
             explain what actually happened in Nigeria at the time  of  the
             birth. However, I am  persuaded  by  what  SOA  said  in  oral
             evidence and what  is  set  out  in  tests  supported  by  the
             photographs of SAA immediately after the 'birth' that SOA  and
             SAA believed that (1) SAA was pregnant (2) that she had  given
             birth to twins (3) that the girl  twin  died  soon  after  the
             birth and that (4) the result of the negative DNA was a  shock
             and unexpected. While therefore the story of  the  appellant's
             birth  appears   implausible,   I   consider   that   in   the
             circumstances of SOA and SAA's overriding wish to have another
             child it is credible."

4.   Two things are plain from perusal of  the  judge's  findings.  Although
    the judge refers in [26] to the balance of probabilities and in [38] to
    the account appearing on the  surface  "improbable",  the  standard  of
    proof he actually applied was simply that of mere possibility. Thus  in
    [38] it was observed that "sham pregnancy results are not  unknown  and
    medication/herbal remedies can mimic pregnancy". In the same  paragraph
    it is noted that  when  people  are  desperate  they  "sometimes"  make
    decisions and act in ways which appear  irrational.   The  clear  error
    here is that the judge was required to treat the  burden  of  proof  as
    resting on the claimant and the standard of proof as being that of  the
    balance of probabilities.

5.   Indeed, one wonders whether even impossibility was a  barrier  for  the
    judge, given that he stated at [39] that "it is impossible  to  explain
    what actually happened", but that he was  nevertheless  persuaded  that
    the story of the claimant's birth was credible.

6.   A second evident feature of the  judge's  findings  is  that  the  only
    positive reason advanced for finding the story credible was "SOA's  and
    SAA's overriding wish to have another child".  However, that  wish  was
    equally -indeed far more- capable of operating  as  a  reason  for  the
    couple having decided to represent that a child not  their  own  was  a
    biological issue and to persist in this representation even  after  the
    DNA tests were negative.  Yet the judge nowhere  showed  he  considered
    this alternative explanation.

7.   Further, it was an error on the part of  the  judge  in  assessing  the
    intentions of the couple not to address the obvious presenting problems
    with the account of SAA, namely that (a) she  had  studied  nursing  at
    South Bank University; (b) she had spent  all  but  five  days  of  her
    pregnancy in the UK, and yet, (c), despite her history  of  failure  to
    conceive, had never seen fit to have  a scan or a  medical  examination
    by a UK GP or maternity services.  The judge appears to  have  accepted
    SAA's explanation - that she avoided  taking  such  steps  because  the
    herbalist told her to - without demur.

8.   Mr Akindele sought to argue that it was misplaced for the ECO  to  seek
    to challenge  credibility because that  was  only  an  issue  with  the
    original ECO decision whereas the decision under appeal   was  made  on
    the accepted basis that the claimant was not a natural  child.  However
    it was entirely rational for the ECO to have treated the  circumstances
    of the original application as relevant to the new application.

9.   Mr Akindele sought to argue that the ECO's perversity challenge to  the
    judge's positive credibility findings were weakened by  the  fact  that
    UTJ Reeds in granting permission had said that  "on  the  face  of  the
    evidence the findings at [38] and  [39]  were  open  to  the  judge  in
    accepting their account of the pregnancy"; and the original  judge  who
    refused permission  had  referred  to  the  judge's  "full  reasoning".
    However it remains that UTJ Reeds went on to conclude that this  ground
    was arguable and, in any event, a decision by a judge in deciding on an
    application for permission is not made  on  the  basis  of  a  detailed
    consideration of the evidence and submissions and I am  confident  that
    had UTJ Reeds examined the case in more detail she would have  come  to
    the same conclusions as have I.

10.  Mr Akindele urged me to recall  that   a  perversity  challenge  was  a
    difficult one to advance.  I agree but I am entirely satisfied that the
    judge's decision was perverse. The judge's finding are only  explicable
    in the basis that he was moved by sympathy or a resolve not to  subject
    the evidence to proper scrutiny in order to decide whether the  account
    was probable.

11.  For the above reasons I conclude that the  judge  materially  erred  in
    law and his decision is set aside.

12.  I am in  a position  to  re-make  the  decision  without  further  ado.
    There has been no request that if I find an error of law I should  hear
    evidence from the sponsor. I  have the record of evidence given by  the
    sponsor to the FtT Judge and there is no reason to think he would  give
    different evidence if called to give oral testimony.

13.  It is important to note that in addition  to  the  record  of  evidence
    given by the sponsor to the FtT Judge there are a  considerable  number
    of items of evidence which have been produced  by  the  claimant  which
    include statements from SOA, SAA and a  letter  from  the  director  of
    Social Welfare Services, Ogun State, and photographs.

14.  The judge properly concluded that the appellant could  not  succeed  in
    showing he had a right of abode  or  met  the  requirements  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The only possible basis on which the claimant could
    succeed was Article 8 outside the Rules.  However, in order to be  able
    to succeed under this provision, it is  necessary  for  a  claimant  to
    demonstrate that there is a protected right which in this case can only
    be family life. On the evidence before me in this case, it has not been
    established that the claimant enjoys a family  life  relationship  with
    SOA and SAA.  The basis  on  which  it  is  claimed  this  relationship
    existed is that the claimant was planted on SAA at a point in time when
    she was in hospital believing she had gone into labour and given  birth
    to twins, one of whom was the appellant and that  he  was  subsequently
    brought up by the couple as their child.   Such  a  basis  is  entirely
    fanciful. The account of  SAA  that  she  genuinely  believed  she  was
    pregnant yet decided on the advice of a  herbalist  not  to  check  her
    pregnancy for eight months whilst in the UK is not credible.  To  treat
    the fact that the couple were desperate to have a child as a basis  for
    accepting their account of  this  false  pregnancy  would  be  to  turn
    credibility assessment into an arbitrary  exercise  in  which  (1)  one
    motive is chosen as the real one without consideration of  others;  and
    (2) no regard is had to  the  inherent  improbability  of  the  claimed
    events. I also find it  significant  that  despite  being  informed  in
    November 2012 that the claimant was not related as claimed and  stating
    that they were "devastated" by the DNA  results,  the  couple  made  no
    representations to the ECO regarding this matter, nor did they seek  to
    appeal that decision. If the  claimed  circumstances  were  true,  they
    would surely have sought to challenge the decision immediately and  not
    wait until 5 July 2014 when an application was made on the basis of  an
    adoption itself delayed for some fifteen months.

15.  In assessing the credibility of the account given by  SAA  and  SOA,  I
    have taken fully  into  account  the  bundle  of  documents  they  have
    adduced. For the avoidance of doubt I find I can place no  reliance  on
    them insofar as they seek to evidence the central claim.  Some of  them
    indeed raise many more questions than they  seek  to  answer.   If  for
    example the couple had photographic evidence of other  persons  in  the
    hospital who had attended the claimed birth,  why  had  they  taken  no
    steps to find out if they were complicit in what  they  claim  was  the
    planting on them of someone else's baby?  Why had they not made a final
    complaint against the hospital staff  or  taken  legal  action  against
    them?

16.  For the above reasons I dismiss the claimant's appeal.
