Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr K Norton, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms F Allen of Counsel instructed by Jein Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer but I will  refer  to
    the original appellants, citizens of Sri Lanka born on 22 May 1967,  18
    June 1997 and 26 May 1996 as the appellants herein.  They  applied  for
    entry clearance on 11 April 2014  as  the  wife  and  children  of  the
    sponsor, Mr Kuhadasan.  At the time of application  he  had  indefinite
    leave to remain but is now a British citizen.

2.   Under the Rules  the  appellants  were  required  to  show  that  their
    sponsor had an income of  �24,800  a  year  and  to  provide  mandatory
    evidence of this.

3.   The sponsor relied on two sources of income.  His  primary  source  was
    employment with a company which paid him the equivalent  of  �22,612.72
    per annum.  Problems arose,  however,  in  relation  to  the  sponsor's
    second job at Norton Cross Petrol Station where he earned �64 per week,
    taking his annual income above the relevant threshold to �25,940.72 per
    annum.

4.   Initially, the respondent had argued that the claimed  income  was  not
    genuine in the light of a document verification report from HMRC.  This
    point was withdrawn on the day of the hearing in the light  of  updated
    HMRC records.  It was now accepted that  the  records  were  consistent
    with the sponsor's claimed earnings from each of his  two  employments.
    The judge recorded that one issue remained live because in  respect  of
    the sponsor's second job he was paid in cash and did not always deposit
    it in a bank which meant he could  not  produce  an  item  of  evidence
    specified in Appendix FM-SE in respect of that  income  -  namely  bank
    statements specifically showing the receipt of the  wages.   The  judge
    referred to Ukus (discretion: when reviewable) [2012]  UKUT  00307(IAC)
    and set out at paragraphs 14 and 15 of his decision what he  considered
    to be the relevant paragraphs of the Rules as follows:

         "14. The relevant paragraphs of the rules for the  purposes  of  my
             decision are from Appendix FM-SE:


             'D(e)Where the decision-maker is satisfied  that  there  is  a
                  valid  reason  why  a  specified  document(s)  cannot   be
                  supplied, e.g. because it is not issued  in  a  particular
                  country or has  been  permanently  lost,  he  or  she  may
                  exercise discretion not to apply the requirement  for  the
                  document(s)  or  to  request  alternative  or   additional
                  information or document(s) be submitted by the applicant.'


         15.  The mandatory documents for evidence of receipt  of  a  salary
             include:


             (c)   Personal  bank  statements  corresponding  to  the  same
                  period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing  that
                  the salary has been paid into an account in  the  name  of
                  the person or in the name of the person and their  partner
                  jointly'."


5.    The  judge  heard  submissions  and  concluded  his  determination  as
    follows:

         "26. The case has progressed significantly from where we were  when
             the  decision  letter  was  written.   The  Home  Office   has
             effectively  conceded  that  the  points  for   refusing   the
             applications detailed in the decision letters were wrong.  The
             Home Office has conceded that inaccurate information came from
             HMRC and while I note that that is not the fault of  the  Home
             Office, it cannot be said to be the fault of the Appellants or
             their Sponsor either.  The Home Office has also conceded  that
             genuine marriage certificates and evidence of the relationship
             have been produced.


         27.  On the basis of the concessions and  agreements  made  in  the
             hearings before me I find that the Sponsor and Appellants  are
             related as claimed, that the Sponsor had earnings in excess of
             the required level for the whole of the six  months  prior  to
             the date of application and  that  the  Sponsor  was  able  to
             provide all mandatory evidence in respect of the  income  from
             his main occupation namely payslips, bank statements  and  the
             letter from the employer.


         28.  In respect of the job at Norton Cross Service Station  I  find
             that this was a genuine employment, I find  that  the  Sponsor
             received the wages and I find that he has  produced  mandatory
             evidence in respect of this  income  including  the  full  six
             months of payslips and more, a letter from the  employer,  and
             records from HMRC which corroborate  his  claimed  income.   I
             find that as he was paid in cash the  Sponsor  was  unable  to
             produce bank statements showing receipt of the wages of �64  a
             week for this job at the relevant time.


         29.  The only reason the Home Office gives to justify  the  refusal
             of this application under  the  rules  now  is  the  Sponsor's
             inability to produce bank statements which show the receipt of
             wages for the second job relied on.


         30.  I note that as a matter of general law employers are  entitled
             to pay their  employees  in  cash.   I  also  accept  that  an
             individual might not find it convenient or practical to  visit
             the bank to deposit �50 or so in  cash  each  week  especially
             when as in this case the Sponsor had a full  time  job  during
             the week to go to.


         31.   I  note  that  the  list  of  circumstances  which  might  be
             considered  'valid'  reasons  for  not   producing   mandatory
             documents in paragraph D(e) of FM-SE is  not  exhaustive.   It
             does however say that it would be valid not produce a document
             if 'it cannot be supplied'.  In this instance the reason  that
             the bank statements cannot be supplied is  because  the  wages
             were paid in cash.


         32.  When considering whether or not this represents a valid reason
             I have taken into account the fact that the  Sponsor  has  not
             avoided  disclosing  his  bank  statements  and   has   indeed
             disclosed the  full  six  months  of  bank  statements  he  is
             required to do to corroborate his claimed  earnings  from  his
             primary job.  The Sponsor has provided the last six months  of
             his bank statements and has not sought to hide  anything  from
             the Home Office.  I am satisfied on the  facts  of  this  case
             that there is a valid reason why bank statements that show the
             receipt of wages for the second job cannot be produced.


         33.  However given that the Entry Clearance Officer  believed  that
             the documents provided as evidence of income were not  genuine
             I am satisfied that he  could  not  possibly  have  considered
             whether or not it was  appropriate  to  apply  the  discretion
             contained in paragraph D(e) in this case.  The  case  of  UKUS
             cited above makes it clear that  in  this  instance  the  only
             option open to me is to allow the appeal on the basis that the
             decision is not in accordance with the law as  the  Respondent
             has not considered the discretion contained in the Immigration
             Rules.


         34.  When considering whether or not it is appropriate to  exercise
             that discretion I would ask that the Entry  Clearance  Officer
             bears in mind the fact  that  due  to  the  second  and  third
             Appellant's ages they will have no option  of  reapplying  for
             these visas under the rules in the  future  because  they  are
             over 18 and they would be required to demonstrate  exceptional
             compassionate circumstances in order to be admitted.


         35.  Because I have found that the Secretary of State has failed to
             consider  the  exercise  of  discretion   contained   in   the
             Immigration  Rules  I  do  not  consider  that  it  would   be
             appropriate for me to look at the Article  8  implications  of
             the decision.  I will simply observe that it would  appear  to
             be profoundly unfair for a family whom  the  Home  Office  has
             accepted had the required levels of earnings at  the  date  of
             application should be refused simply because one employer paid
             wages in cash for a period of  time  when  this  represents  a
             small portion of the total income relied on."


6.   There was  an  application  for  permission  to  appeal  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer on the basis that the appellants could only  rely  on
    the sponsor's income  which  was  demonstrated  by  specified  evidence
    contained in Appendix FM-SE.  Only wages paid into a bank  account  and
    appearing on the statements could  be  counted  towards  the  sponsor's
    gross income in accordance with the evidence of financial  requirements
    at paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE which provided:

         "The gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
         person's specified  bank  statements  show  the  net  amount  which
         relates to the gross amount shown on  their  payslips  (or  in  the
         relevant specified evidence provided in addition to  the  specified
         bank statements in relation to non-employment income).   Otherwise,
         only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements  may  be
         counted."

7.   It was not open to the judge to draw his own conclusions based  on  the
    credibility of the sponsor or other documents in the absence  of  those
    specified.  It was not clear on what basis the appeal had been allowed.

8.   Permission to appeal was  granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    judge commented in relation to the point made by the respondent that it
    was unclear on which  basis  the  appeal  had  been  allowed,  that  it
    appeared to be the case that the judge had allowed the  appeal  on  the
    basis that the decision was unlawful and had remitted it  back  to  the
    respondent.  While the judge found it was arguably an error of law that
    the case fell within FM-SE D(e) it was apparent  that  the  appellant's
    level of income had been accepted and that there was  evidence  of  tax
    paid upon it.

9.   Mr Norton accepted  that  it  was  understandable  that  permission  to
    appeal had been granted but the requirements of the Rules could not  be
    met in the light of the fact that the cash had not  been  paid  into  a
    specified account.  It was not disputed that the HMRC records had  been
    updated and it was now accepted that the records were  consistent  with
    the claimed earnings.  Discretion did  not  exist  to  correct  errors.
    There had been no Rule 24  response  from  the  appellant's  side.   He
    submitted that the last sentence of paragraph 28 of  the  decision  was
    the lacuna in the case.  The sponsor had been unable  to  produce  bank
    statements showing receipt of his wages at the relevant time.

10.  Ms Allen referred to various subparagraphs of Appendix FM-SE and I  put
    the case back in order to enable copies to be made and provided  to  Mr
    Norton.  She pointed out that in addition to subparagraph (n) to  which
    the respondent had made reference in the  grounds,  paragraph  (m)  was
    also of relevance and this read: "cash income on which the correct  tax
    has been paid may be counted as income under this Appendix, subject  to
    the relevant evidential requirements of this Appendix".

11.  In relation to Appendix FM-SE, apart from the paragraph referred to  by
    the First-tier Judge Counsel referred to paragraph D(d) which provided:



         "If the applicant has submitted:


         (i)  a document in the wrong format; or


         (ii) a document that is a copy and not an original document;


         (iii)    a document that does not  contain  all  of  the  specified
             information, but the missing information is verifiable from:


             (1)  other documents submitted with the application.


             (2)   the  website  of  the  organisation  which  issued   the
                  document, or


             (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory body,


         the  application  may  be  granted  exceptionally,  providing   the
         decision-maker is satisfied that the  document(s)  is  genuine  and
         that the applicant meets the  requirement  to  which  the  document
         relates.  The decision-maker reserves  the  right  to  request  the
         specific original document(s) in the correct format  in  all  cases
         where sub-paragraph (b) applies, and to refuse applications if this
         material is not provided as set out in sub-paragraph (b)."


12.  The respondent had a  discretion  as  established  in  Sultana  (rules:
    waiver/further enquiry;  discretion)  [2014]  UKUT  00540  (IAC).   The
    Tribunal had referred in paragraph 20 of the decision to paragraph D(e)
    of the Appendix specifically in the context that  concern  the  instant
    appeal namely providing the necessary records for  what  was  purely  a
    cash enterprise.  In the appellant's case  it  was  accepted  that  the
    sponsor's income had been taxed in  full.   The  First-tier  Judge  was
    right to remit the appeal to the  respondent  given  the  discretionary
    powers referred to in Sultana and what was said in paragraphs 23 and 24
    of that case.

13.  Mr Norton referred to paragraphs 18 to  20  of  Sultana  and  submitted
    that  the  discretion  was  confined  to  cases  where  applicants  had
    submitted a document in the wrong format or a copy document rather than
    an original.  Accordingly, a fresh application was required to be  made
    in this case.  While there were bank statements the cash paid from  the
    appellant's employment at the service station had not  been  paid  into
    them.  It was accepted that the payslips and the employment letter  and
    the bank statements had all been lodged at the time of the application.



14.  At the conclusion of the submission I reserved my decision.   I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Judge if it was materially flawed in law.

15.  This is a case in which the facts have all been accepted.  As has  been
    made clear, all the relevant evidence was put in at  the  time  of  the
    application.  In Sultana there had been "an outright failure to provide
    myriad mandatory documents".  In this case there is no dispute that the
    appellant's wages were properly declared to the Revenue and that he has
    paid tax on all his income.  It is not a case of missing information  -
    all the information was provided with the application.

16.  It is important to recall that  the  decision  was  taken  against  the
    background of mistaken information given by HMRC. The  appellants  were
    not to blame. In such circumstances, as  the  judge  found,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer failed to exercise discretion and is now required  to
    exercise discretion lawfully.  The  way  in  which  the  discretion  is
    exercised is a matter for the Entry Clearance  Officer.   It  does  not
    inevitably follow that the appellants will be granted what  they  seek.
    In this case, as the judge records in paragraph  35,  it  was  accepted
    that the sponsor had demonstrated the required levels of earnings as at
    the date of application.  There are two special features  in  the  case
    apart from the fact that the earnings have been accepted.  The first is
    that the decision was taken against the background of wrong information
    coming from HMRC and secondly the point made by the judge in  paragraph
    34 of his decision about the  particular  difficulties  faced  by  this
    family in the light of refusal.

Decision

17.  The appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  is  dismissed  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Judge stands. The appellants await a  lawful
    decision from the Entry Clearance Officer.

Anonymity Direction

18.  The First-tier Judge made no anonymity order and I make none.

Fee Award

19.  The First-tier Judge made a full fee award  totalling  �420  and  there
    appears to be no reason why that award should  not  stand  in  all  the
    circumstances.
