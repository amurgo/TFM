For the Appellant:     Ms M. Knorr, Counsel instructed by Wilson & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr C. Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are a family  of  Palestinians  currently  living  in  a
    refugee camp in Tyre, Lebanon. The  first  and  second  Appellants  are
    husband  and  wife;  the  remaining  five  are  their  minor  children,
    currently aged between and 4 and 17.


 2. The family seek entry clearance to  the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to
    settle here with two other children of the family, both  of  whom  have
    been recognised as refugees. These refugees, now adults aged 18 and 20,
    are referred to hereinafter as S1 and S2.


 3. The linked appeals were dismissed by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Traynor) on the 7th  May  2020.  Permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker on the  10th  August
    2020 who found there to be several arguable errors of law in the First-
    tier Tribunal decision.



    Background and Matters in Issue before the First-tier Tribunal


 4. S1 arrived in the United Kingdom in October 2017, when he was  17.   S2
    arrived in the United Kingdom in January 2018, aged  16.     They  both
    claimed asylum on the basis  that  they  had  a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution in Lebanon for reasons of their membership of a  particular
    social group/imputed political opinion.   They had become embroiled  in
    a vicious dispute with the children of a powerful Hezbollah  commander,
    which led to the family as a whole attracting the adverse attention not
    only of Hezbollah but  of  their  allies  in  Fatah  and  the  Lebanese
    authorities.   S1 and S2 being at  the  centre  of  the  dispute  their
    parents arranged for their departure to the United Kingdom.    By  July
    2018 they had both been recognised as refugees.


 5. The applications for entry clearance were made  on  the  21st  November
    2018 when S1 was still a minor.

 6. The Respondent, having found no category under the  rules  which  could
    avail  the  Appellants,  considered  whether  there  were  "exceptional
    circumstances" that would justify granting entry. Finding there  to  be
    none, the applications were refused on the 3rd February 2019.

 7. The case before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  it  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference with the family and private lives of  all
    members of this family to refuse to grant entry  clearance.  Particular
    reliance was placed on the following matters, which  the  Tribunal  was
    asked to weigh cumulatively:

              i) That S1, at the date of the appeal still living  in  foster
                 care, has been diagnosed with very  severe  PTSD,  moderate
                 depression  and  anxiety.  Medical  opinion  was   provided
                 attributing these conditions to both the trauma experienced
                 by S1, but also to his ongoing separation from  his  family
                 and his overwhelming fears for their safety;


             ii) The targeting of the family in Lebanon is ongoing. An uncle
                 of S1 and S2 wrongly arrested in  the  dispute  remains  in
                 custody.  In the absence of S1 and S1 the adverse attention
                 of the agents of persecution has transferred to A3  and  A4
                 who are unable to leave Lebanon illegally due  to  lack  of
                 funds;

            iii) Until S1 and S2 are married and found families of their own
                 they are, in the cultural context  from  which  they  come,
                 considered to be members of their father's household;

             iv) A2 is finding is their  continued  separation  particularly
                 difficult. Her mental and physical health has declined  and
                 she "cries all the time";

              v) Because S1 and S2 are recognised as  refugees  (and  indeed
                 because the Appellants are themselves refugees in  Lebanon)
                 the only realistic prospect of family reunification lies in
                 the United Kingdom;

             vi)  It  is  contrary  to  the  best  interests  of  the  minor
                 Appellants to be separated from their siblings, but also to
                 witness the ongoing emotional  pain  experienced  by  their
                 parents as a result of that separation.





    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 8. Having directed itself  that  the  matter  in  issue  was  whether  the
    decision was a proportionate response under  Article  8,  the  Tribunal
    found as follows:


              i) In respect of the claim that the family  continue  to  face
                 difficulties in Lebanon "they have never been  specific  in
                 identifying the form of harassment, who perpetrates it  and
                 in what circumstances" [�65]: such evidence that  there  is
                 is found to be "vague and in some  respects  self-serving".
                 The Appellants are not facing any  particular  difficulties
                 in accessing food, medication or treatment [�79].


             ii) The parents of this family made a "conscious  decision"  to
                 send their eldest sons to the United Kingdom  because  they
                 already had family here, namely their maternal aunt who  is
                 settled here by marriage  [�67,  80].   This  aunt  visited
                 Lebanon on several occasions in the years before  the  boys
                 arrived and the Judge deduces from this that  during  these
                 visits the family discussed together the "clear attraction"
                 of the whole family moving to the United Kingdom.

            iii) As to the opinion of the Consultant  Clinical  Psychologist
                 Dr Heke that S1 is suffering complex mental health problems
                 as a result of his  experiences,  the  Tribunal  postulates
                 that "it is clear" that a contributing factor to this would
                 be his  "physiological  development  and  maturing"  as  an
                 adolescent, something that the doctor does  not  appear  to
                 have taken into account.  The Tribunal  further  attributes
                 S1's emotional difficulties to the family's  "decision"  to
                 place him into foster care.   Finally the Tribunal  deduces
                 from the doctor's comment that S1 appeared smartly  dressed
                 and "calm" that his symptoms are being exaggerated:  if  he
                 needed more mental health support he would have  sought  it
                 [�70, 71, 76].

             iv) S1 is supported by his aunt, college  friend,  brother  and
                 foster carer, with whom he enjoys a good relationship.   He
                 also maintains contact with his  parents  and  siblings  by
                 telephone  and  social  media.   He   is   moving   towards
                 independence and has good self-care [�75, 77]

              v) No weight can be given to the "threat" that  in  the  event
                 that these appeals fail C1 and C2 will be  sent  abroad  by
                 their parents using illegal smuggling  networks  contra  to
                 their best interests.


 9. Having weighed all  of  those  matters  in  the  balance  the  Tribunal
    concludes that the appeals must be dismissed.




    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings


10. Ms Knorr's first complaint is that the Judge was wrong  to  state  that
    there was no  credible  evidence  before  him  demonstrating  that  the
    Appellants, and in particular the two eldest children left in Lebanon ,
    are experiencing harassment and threats from the Hezbollah  family  who
    caused S1 and S2 to flee.  The evidence is described by  the  Judge  as
    "vague", "self-serving" and "not  credible".  Ms  Knorr  rightly  takes
    issue with each of these terms.


11. The evidence cannot rationally be described as vague.  The Tribunal was
    not faced  with  unparticularised  assertion.  The  witness  statements
    detailed a number  of  specific  incidents,  for  instance  the  eldest
    daughter being surrounded by a number of boys, sworn at,  touched,  and
    having her school books knocked out of her hand. About 2 months  before
    the appeal both she and  her  brother  were  approached  at  school  by
    outsiders  who  asked  them  where  S1  and  S2  were:  the  headmaster
    intervened and had the individuals removed from  the  school  property.
    The children did not attend school for  20  days  after  this  incident
    because they were fearful for  their  safety.   Both  S1  and  S2  gave
    unchallenged evidence about their fears for their family, and that they
    genuinely hold such subjective fear was confirmed by their aunt and the
    medical report.  Although the decision acknowledges that  some  of  the
    Appellants have provided witness statements, it does  appear  that  the
    Tribunal may  have  missed  some  of  the  contents:  otherwise  it  is
    difficult to understand its conclusion that the evidence on this matter
    was "vague".

12. Nor is  the  term  "self-serving"  particularly  illuminating.  As  the
    current President Mr Justice Lane observes in R (on the application  of
    SS) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  ("self-serving"
    statements) [2017] UKUT 00164 (IAC) "the  expression  itself  tells  us
    little or nothing".  Unless there is a specific and obvious  reason  to
    conclude that a piece of evidence has  been  deliberately  manufactured
    for  the  purpose  of  supporting  an  appeal,  it  is  a   meaningless
    conclusion.  Here  the  First-tier  Tribunal  attempts  to   use   such
    justification when it states:

         "it is self-serving because it is clear that this is being used  as
         a reason in order to suggest that circumstances  which  the  family
         face in Lebanon are themselves worsening".

    With respect, that does not bring the allegation within the rubric  set
    out by Lane J. Any evidence adduced by claimants is likely  to  support
    their case. That does not mean that it should be  dismissed  as  "self-
    serving". In this case the Tribunal was faced with entirely  consistent
    statements made by multiple people which were, in the  context  of  the
    asylum  claims   already   accepted   by   the   Respondent,   entirely
    unremarkable. The claims advanced by S1  and  S2  were  that  they  had
    become involved in a bitter dispute with a  powerful  Hezbollah  family
    who were furious that S2 had accused one of their number  of  stealing.
    In the context of power dynamics in Lebanon the  dispute  escalated  to
    involve a real risk of direct physical harm being caused to S1 and  S2.
    Their stand against this family  was  interpreted  as  insubordination,
    which had to be punished.   It was not therefore  the  Appellants  case
    that the position of their family was "worsening". It was  simply  that
    the background conflict which had  led  S1  and  S2  to  flee  had  not
    disappeared. The animosity faced by the family had  not,  as  they  had
    hoped, been diminished by the departure of the two  eldest  boys.  That
    this was causing S1 and S2 considerable distress was evidenced in their
    unchallenged witness statements and  by  the  doctor's  report  on  S1.
    Against the background of the successful asylum  claims  it  was  quite
    wrong for the Tribunal to suggest that the evidence  was  self-serving.
    It did no more than confirm the status  quo  already  accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State.


13. That being the case I find that there was no lawful reason advanced for
    the conclusion expressed at [�68]: "I find that they have not  provided
    any  credible  evidence  which  establishes  that  they  are  suffering
    problems as a consequence of events  involving  their  elder  brother".
    The evidence was not vague, nor could it legitimately be  described  as
    self-serving.  The  evidence  was,   in  fact,  detailed   and   wholly
    consistent with the facts already accepted in the asylum claims  of  S1
    and S2.


14. Ground 2 concerns the case theory settled upon  by  the  Tribunal  that
    these  applications  were  the  final  part  of  a  long-term  plan  to
    facilitate the family's migration from Lebanon to the  United  Kingdom.
    The decision repeatedly returns to the idea that the First  and  Second
    Appellants discussed this idea with the Second  Appellant's  sister  on
    her visits home to Lebanon: the Tribunal speculates that they  actively
    "chose" to send their sons to the United Kingdom to claim  asylum,  and
    so finds "whilst there is an impact of  separation,  it  is  not  as  a
    consequence of the Respondent's decision" [�80].     It is submitted on
    behalf  of  the  Appellants  that  the   Tribunal   here   engaged   in
    impermissible speculation,  and  reaching  findings  not  supported  by
    evidence or reasons.

15. I am satisfied that this ground is made out.  It is  possible  that  as
    long ago as 2014 [see the FTT �67] the adults in this family cooked  up
    this scheme. It is possible that the parents of S1 and  S2  sent  their
    teenage sons off with people smugglers to travel to the United  Kingdom
    so that the rest of the family could later make applications for  entry
    clearance.   It is possible that before they did so they coached S1 and
    S2 to maintain a consistent and detailed  account  which  would  enable
    them to get asylum. It is possible that each of the witness  statements
    now  advanced  are  the  culmination  of  that  cynical  scheme.    The
    difficulty is that there is absolutely no evidential foundation for any
    of that. All of the evidence in fact pointed the other way.


16. Ground 3 is  concerned  with  the  approach  taken  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to the evidence of Consultant Clinical Psychologist  Dr  Heke.
    Dr Heke is Director of  the  Institute  of  Psychotrauma,  East  London
    Foundation NHS Trust. In her 23 year career  in  the  NHS  and  private
    practice she has worked extensively with people  who  have  experienced
    psychological traumas including trafficking, childhood abuse,  torture,
    or war. She formerly managed the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Service
    in her East London post and is currently  providing  specialist  trauma
    supervision  for  the  40  psychological  therapists  attached  to  the
    Grenfell  Health  and  Wellbeing  Service  who  are  dealing  with  the
    aftermath of the fire.

17. Prior to her consultation with S1 Dr Heke had  access  to  all  of  the
    relevant  documentation  and  background  information.   Bringing   her
    clinical expertise to bear Dr  Heke  applied  the  relevant  diagnostic
    criteria to diagnose S1 as suffering from very  severe  PTSD,  moderate
    depression and moderate anxiety. She attributes these conditions to his
    traumatic  experiences,   separation   from   his   family,   and   his
    "overwhelming fears for their safety". Her report is  detailed,  cogent
    and, Mr Bates confirms, unchallenged by the Respondent.

18. The conclusions reached by the Tribunal on this report are set  out  at
    [�70]:

         "I have considered the expert report of Dr Heke and her  view  that
         the only reason why there has been any change in [S1]'s   demeanour
         is because of events which he has encountered. I find  that  little
         weight has been given to the fact that he has been experiencing his
         adolescence and maturing from a young boy into a young man and that
         this, of itself, is likely to bring about a degree  of  change  and
         the manner in which he would project himself and  communicate  with
         others. Whilst not minimising the fact that he has been  recognised
         by the UK authorities as someone who would be at risk  upon  return
         to Lebanon, it is clear that his emotional difficulties  arise  not
         only as a consequence of separation from his family, but also as  a
         result of his own physiological development and maturing"

    And at [�77]:

         "The medical evidence of Dr Heke also informs me that the matter in
         which [S1]'s circumstances are being  presented  are  to  a  degree
         exaggerated. In her report Dr Heke refers to [S1] being calm in his
         demeanour, well kempt, smartly dressed and that when describing his
         difficulties was initially distressed, but then became calm"

19. All of this leads the Tribunal to conclude at [�81]:


         "I find there is no evidence that the separation between [S1]   and
         his parents is having any greater effect than would be expected  on
         a young person moving away to university, or leaving home  for  the
         first time".


20.  It is of course axiomatic that credibility is a matter for a judge not
    an expert witness, and  that  Tribunals  are  not  only  entitled,  but
    obliged,  to  make  their  own  assessments  of  the  case  which   can
    legitimately entail the reaching of conclusions  different  from  those
    expressed by the expert. This  does  not  however  mean  that  decision
    makers can simply supplant the views of  a  properly  qualified  expert
    with their own 'expert' opinion on the matter in hand. As Jowitt J puts
    it in R (ex parte Khaira) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [1998] EWHC Admin 355: "it is  not  appropriate  for  a  civil  servant
    without medical expertise  to  reach  a  conclusion  contrary  to  that
    reached by a psychiatrist simply by drawing on his own native wit".


21. The matter in hand here was the complex mental  health  needs  of  this
    child refugee. Dr Heke's considered opinion about both the  extent  and
    causation of these conditions is apparently  set  aside  by  the  Judge
    because he believes that she has not given  sufficient  weight  to  the
    fact that S1 is a teenager and so undergoing "a degree of change". Nor,
    apparently, has she noticed that S1 was smartly  dressed  and  able  to
    compose himself after a period  of  distress.     In  fact,  finds  the
    Judge, S1 is just like a young man who has moved to university, and who
    misses his family.  In support of her submission that this approach was
    legally impermissible Ms Knorr cites several well-known authorities.  I
    need not set them all out here since Mr Bates for the Respondent had no
    hesitation in agreeing that this ground is made out.   I will therefore
    confine my commentary to this. In the absence of  a  challenge  to  the
    expertise or methodology of Dr Heke the  Tribunal  could,  and  should,
    assume that she knows what she is doing.  Dr Heke was well  aware  that
    S1 was a teenager, and we know that she observed that  he  was  smartly
    dressed and able to compose himself because they were her observations.
     It can, and should, therefore be assumed  that  she  has  taken  those
    matters into account.    The conclusion reached by the Tribunal -  that
    S1 was akin to a fresher at university - was a perverse negation of all
    of Dr Heke's expert evidence, S1's grant of refugee status  and  indeed
    all of the evidence before the Tribunal.


22. The final ground concerns the Tribunal's failure to undertake  a  'best
    interests' assessment in accordance with its duties under s.55  of  the
    Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 in the context of  Article
    8.    I need not dwell on this save to say that the Secretary of  State
    accepts that the Tribunal failed to conduct a lawful examination of the
    best interests of S1, and failed to apply the spirit of the section  in
    respect of the minor Appellants.

23. For the foregoing reasons I am satisfied that all four grounds are made
    out. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for error of law
    and it must be set aside.



    The Re-Made Decision

24.  These  appeals  are  brought  under  s82(1)(b)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which provides that an  appeal  may  be
    brought where the Secretary of State has refused a human rights  claim.
    The ground of appeal is as set out at s84(2) of the Act:


          (2) An appeal under section 82(1)(b) (refusal of human rights
         claim) must be brought on the ground that the decision is unlawful
         under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.



25. Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that  it  is  "unlawful
    for a public authority to act in a way which  is  incompatible  with  a
    Convention right".


26. The Convention right in play here is Article 8 of the ECHR:


         Right to respect for private and family life


      1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,
         his home and his correspondence.

      2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
         exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law
         and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
         national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the
         country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the
         protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
         and freedoms of others.


27. In migration cases involving removal the question for  decision  makers
    is whether the removal would result in an interference with  Article  8
    (1) rights which would be disproportionate to the legitimate  aims  set
    out in Article 8(2). In cases such as this, involving entry  clearance,
    the  question  is  whether  the  decision  to   refuse   entry   is   a
    disproportionate "lack of respect" for the family and/or  private  life
    of the parties concerned:  Shamim Box v Entry Clearance Officer (Dhaka)
    [2002] UKIAT 02212.  The parties further agreed that  the  human  right
    that I am concerned with is the family life of both the Appellants  and
    their United Kingdom Sponsors:  Beoku-Betts v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2008] UKHL 38.


28. In Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  SS  (Congo)  &  Ors
    [2015] Civ 387 the Court of Appeal further explored the  principles  to
    be applied in Article 8 entry clearance cases, in particular  examining
    the interplay between the Immigration Rules and  the  United  Kingdom's
    wider obligations under the Convention:

         14. [..]The width of the gap between what the Immigration Rules set
         out by way of entitlement to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom
         and the requirements  resulting  from  application  of  a  relevant
         Convention right - in these appeals, we are concerned  with  rights
         under Article 8 - may be highly relevant in certain contexts.  This
         is because, in the immigration field, the fair balance required  to
         be struck  pursuant  to  Article  8  between  individual  interests
         protected  by  that  provision  and  the  general  public  interest
         typically involves bringing into account  certain  public  interest
         considerations in relation to which the Secretary of  State  has  a
         legitimate role to fulfil by formulating an  approach  which  gives
         them proper value and weight. The Secretary of State is responsible
         for the overall operation of  the  immigration  system  as  a  fair
         system which properly reflects and balances a range  of  interests,
         including important aspects of the  public  interest,  and  she  is
         accountable to Parliament for what she does.


         15. In the Convention case-law  of  the  European  Court  of  Human
         Rights  ("ECtHR")  it  is  well  recognised   that   the   national
         authorities are in principle better placed than the Court  to  make
         judgments regarding the needs  and  resources  of  their  societies
         (see, e.g., Stec v United Kingdom (2006) 43 EHRR  47,  para.  [52])
         and that "questions of administrative  economy  and  coherence  are
         generally matters falling within the margin of appreciation"  which
         this approach implies (ibid.). Within the national legal order,  it
         is the Secretary of State and Parliament who are in principle  best
         placed  to  make  such  judgments.  Accordingly,   in   appropriate
         contexts, weight may be given by the courts  to  their  assessments
         about  what  is  required.  Typically,  this  finds  expression  in
         allowing a wider margin of appreciation or  discretionary  area  of
         judgment where such considerations are required to be brought  into
         play in striking the relevant balance between individual and public
         interests.




29. It is in this context that the relevant Immigration Rules must be read.
    In part 11 of the Rules the Secretary of State has made  provision  for
    close  family  members  to  seek  family  reunification  with   persons
    recognised as refugees in the United Kingdom.  Only two  categories  of
    applicants benefit from these rules. Paragraph 352A is  concerned  with
    partners:

         352A. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom as the partner of a person granted
         refugee status are that:
         (i) the applicant is the partner of a person who currently has
         refugee status granted under the Immigration Rules in the United
         Kingdom; and
         (ii) the marriage or civil partnership did not take place after the
         person granted refugee status left the country of their former
         habitual residence in order to seek asylum or the parties have been
         living together in a relationship akin to marriage or a civil
         partnership which has subsisted for two years or more before the
         person granted refugee status left the country of their former
         habitual residence in order to seek asylum; and
         (iii) the relationship existed before the person granted refugee
         status left the country of their former habitual residence in order
         to seek asylum; and
         (iv) the applicant would not be excluded from protection by virtue
         of paragraph 334(iii) or (iv) of these Rules or Article 1F of the
         Refugee Convention if they were to seek asylum in their own right;
         and
         (v) each of the parties intends to live permanently with the other
         as their partner and the relationship is genuine and subsisting
         (vi) the applicant and their partner must not be within the
         prohibited degree of relationship; and
         (vii) if seeking leave to enter, the applicant holds a valid United
         Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this capacity.

    And paragraph 352D is  concerned  with  the  minor  children  of  adult
    sponsors:


         352D. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom in order to join or remain with the
         parent who currently has refugee status are that the applicant:
         (i) is the child of a parent who currently has refugee status
         granted under the Immigration Rules in the United Kingdom; and
         (ii) is under the age of 18; and
         (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is not a
         civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit; and
         (iv) was part of the family unit of the person granted asylum at
         the time that the person granted asylum left the country of their
         habitual residence in order to seek asylum; and
         (v) the applicant would not be excluded from protection by virtue
         of paragraph 334(iii) or (iv) of these Rules or Article 1F of the
         Refugee Convention if they were to seek asylum in their own right;
         and
         (vi) if seeking leave to enter, holds a valid United Kingdom entry
         clearance for entry in this capacity.


30. No provision is made for the parents or siblings of child  refugees  to
    join them in the United Kingdom.  In AT and another (Article 8  ECHR  -
    Child Refugee - Family Reunification) Eritrea [2016] UKUT  00227  (IAC)
    the former President McCloskey J (as he then was)  explores  the  legal
    background to the rules:

        10.  The  Secretary  of  State's  policy  in  the  realm  of  family
            reunification, as expressed in the Immigration Rules, dates from
            the year 2000. Its most important feature, for the  purposes  of
            these appeals, is that no  provision  has  ever  been  made  for
            family reunification in the case  of  a  child  who  has  gained
            refugee status in the United Kingdom. This  discrete  regime  is
            currently contained in Part 8 of Appendix FM to  the  Rules,  at
            paragraphs 352A - 352G and 819L - 819U.  In short,  spouses  and
            minor children of a "sponsor" can,  subject  to  satisfying  the
            governing conditions, secure family reunification in the  United
            Kingdom  by  the  grant  of  leave  to  enter.   However,   this
            possibility does not exist where the sponsor is a child.


        11. Thus a blanket prohibition is in operation.  Historically, there
            was a short lived exception to this prohibition relating to  the
            parents of  unaccompanied  children  who  had  fled  Kosovo  and
            secured asylum in  the  United  Kingdom.   This  concession  was
            confined to the short time frame  of  July  to  September  1999.
            With effect from  02  October  2000,  the  family  reunification
            regime  enshrined  in  the  Immigration  Rules   contained   the
            aforementioned blanket  prohibition.   From  then  to  2006  the
            Secretary of State operated a policy of permitting  the  parents
            or siblings of unaccompanied minor refugees to enter the  United
            Kingdom for the purpose of reunification only  where  compelling
            and compassionate circumstances were  demonstrated.  Since  2006
            the  Secretary  of  State's   policy   has   extinguished   this
            possibility.   While   these   appeals   have   generated   much
            documentary evidence pertaining to this discrete  issue,  it  is
            striking that there is  no  evidence  bearing  directly  on  the
            policy aims and justification underpinning this exclusion...


31. I pause here to note that McCloskey  J  was  wrong  to  categorise  the
    lacuna in the Rules as amounting to a "blanket prohibition": see KF and
    others (Entry Clearance, relatives of refugees) Syria [2019] UKUT 00413
    (IAC) [at �16(c)].  Nothing in the  rules  mandates  refusal  of  entry
    clearance to the close family members of child refugees: the  point  is
    that there is no positive provision.  He is however correct to say that
    the Secretary of State has not to  date,  at  least  in  any  published
    policy document or case of which I am aware, offered any  justification
    for the exclusion.


32. The  rules  then,  make  no  provision  for  individuals  such  as  the
    Appellants in this case.  Returning to SS (Congo) I remind myself  that
    the national authority - here the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department - is in principle better placed than the  Tribunal  to  make
    judgments regarding the needs and resources of their society, and where
    the balance should accordingly be struck  between  the  rights  of  the
    individuals concerned and the wider public  interest.  This  margin  of
    appreciation is not however a fixed boundary [at �17]:



         17. If the gap between what Article 8 requires and the  content  of
         the Immigration Rules is wide, then the part for the  Secretary  of
         State's residual discretion to play in satisfying the  requirements
         of Article 8 and section 6(1) of the HRA  will  be  correspondingly
         greater. In  such  circumstances,  the  practical  guidance  to  be
         derived from the content of the Rules as to relevant public  policy
         considerations for the purposes of the balance to be  struck  under
         Article 8 is also likely to  be  reduced:  to  use  the  expression
         employed by Aikens LJ in MM (Lebanon) in the Court  of  Appeal,  at
         [135], the proportionality balancing  exercise  "will  be  more  at
         large". If the Secretary of State  has  not  made  a  conscientious
         effort to strike a fair balance for the purposes of  Article  8  in
         making the Rules, a court or tribunal will naturally be disinclined
         to give significant weight to her view regarding the actual balance
         to be struck when the  court  or  tribunal  has  to  consider  that
         question for itself. On the other  hand,  where  the  Secretary  of
         State has sought to fashion the content  of  the  Rules  so  as  to
         strike what she regards as the appropriate balance under Article  8
         and any gap between the  Rules  and  what  Article  8  requires  is
         comparatively narrow, the Secretary of State's formulation  of  the
         Rules may allow the Court to be more confident that she has brought
         a focused assessment of considerations of the  public  interest  to
         bear on the matter. That will in turn allow the Court more  readily
         to give weight to that assessment  when  making  its  own  decision
         pursuant to Article 8....

    I further note that  in  these  cases  the  refusal  notices  offer  no
    explanation of  the  matters  weighed  in  the  balance  in  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's proportionality balancing exercise.


33. The Court  in  SS  (Congo)  concluded  by  summarising  the  applicable
    principles:


         39. In our judgment, the position under Article 8 in relation to an
         application for LTE on the basis  of  family  life  with  a  person
         already in the United Kingdom is as follows:


              i) A person outside the United Kingdom may have a  good  claim
                 under Article 8 to be allowed to enter the  United  Kingdom
                 to join family members already here so as  to  continue  or
                 develop existing family life: see e.g.  G�l  v  Switzerland
                 (1996) 22 EHRR 93 and Sen v Netherlands (2001) 36  EHRR  7.
                 Article 8 does not confer  an  automatic  right  of  entry,
                 however. Article 8 imposes no general obligation on a state
                 to facilitate the choice made by a married couple to reside
                 in it:  R  (Quila)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
                 Department [2011] UKSC 45; [2012] 1  AC  621,  para.  [42];
                 Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United Kingdom (1985) 7
                 EHRR 471, [68]; G�l  v  Switzerland,  [38].  The  state  is
                 entitled to control immigration: Huang, para. [18].


             ii) The approach  to  identifying  positive  obligations  under
                 Article 8(1) draws on Article 8(2) by analogy, but  is  not
                 identical with analysis under Article  8(2):  see,  in  the
                 immigration context, Abdulaziz, Cabales  and  Balkandali  v
                 United Kingdom, paras. [67]-[68]; G�l v Switzerland,  [38];
                 and Sen v Netherlands,  [31]-[32].  See  also  the  general
                 guidance on the applicable principles given  by  the  Grand
                 Chamber of the ECtHR in Draon v France (2006) 42 EHRR 40 at
                 paras. [105]-[108], summarising the effect of  the  leading
                 authorities as follows (omitting footnotes):


                 "105. While the essential object of Art.8 is to protect the
                 individual against arbitrary  interference  by  the  public
                 authorities, it  does  not  merely  require  the  State  to
                 abstain from such interference: there may  in  addition  be
                 positive obligations inherent in  effective  "respect"  for
                 family life. The boundaries between  the  State's  positive
                 and negative obligations under this provision do not always
                 lend themselves to  precise  definition;  nonetheless,  the
                 applicable principles are similar. In both contexts  regard
                 must be had to the fair  balance  that  has  to  be  struck
                 between the competing interests of the individual  and  the
                 community as a whole, and in both  contexts  the  State  is
                 recognised as enjoying a certain  margin  of  appreciation.
                 Furthermore, even in relation to the  positive  obligations
                 flowing  from  the  first  paragraph,  "in  striking   [the
                 required]  balance  the  aims  mentioned  in   the   second
                 paragraph may be of a certain relevance".


                 106. "Respect" for family life ...  implies  an  obligation
                 for the State to act in a manner calculated to  allow  ties
                 between close relatives to develop normally. The Court  has
                 held that a state is under this type of obligation where it
                 has found a direct and immediate link between the  measures
                 requested by an applicant, on the one hand, and his private
                 and/or family life on the other.


                 107. However, since the concept of respect is not precisely
                 defined, states enjoy a  wide  margin  of  appreciation  in
                 determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with
                 the Convention with due regard to the needs  and  resources
                 of the community and of individuals. 108. At the same time,
                 the Court reiterates the fundamentally subsidiary  role  of
                 the  Convention.  The  national  authorities  have   direct
                 democratic legitimation and are, as the Court has  held  on
                 many  occasions,  in  principle  better  placed   than   an
                 international court to evaluate local needs and conditions.
                 In matters of general policy, on which  opinions  within  a
                 democratic society may reasonably differ widely,  the  role
                 of  the  domestic  policy-maker  should  be  given  special
                 weight."

            iii) In deciding whether to grant LTE to a family member outside
                 the United Kingdom, the state authorities may  have  regard
                 to  a  range  of  factors,  including  the  pressure  which
                 admission of an applicant may place upon public  resources,
                 the  desirability  of  promoting  social  integration   and
                 harmony and so forth. Refusal of LTE in cases  where  these
                 interests may be undermined may be fair  and  proportionate
                 to the legitimate interests identified in Article  8(2)  of
                 "the  economic  well-being  of  the   country"   and   "the
                 protection of the rights and freedoms of others" (taxpayers
                 and members of society generally). A court will be slow  to
                 find an implied positive  obligation  which  would  involve
                 imposing on the state significant  additional  expenditure,
                 which will necessarily involve  a  diversion  of  resources
                 from other activities of the state in the public  interest,
                 a  matter  which  usually  calls  for  consideration  under
                 democratic procedures.


             iv) On the other hand, the fact that the interests of  a  child
                 are in issue will be a countervailing factor which tends to
                 reduce  to  some  degree  the  width  of  the   margin   of
                 appreciation which the state  authorities  would  otherwise
                 enjoy. Article 8 has to be interpreted and applied  in  the
                 light of the UN Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child
                 (1989): see In re E (Children) (Abduction: Custody  Appeal)
                 [2011] UKSC 27; [2012] AC 144, at [26]. However,  the  fact
                 that the interests of a child are in issue does not  simply
                 provide a trump card so that a child applicant for positive
                 action to be taken by the state in  the  field  of  Article
                 8(1) must always have their application acceded to; see  In
                 re E (Children) at [12] and ZH (Tanzania)  v  Secretary  of
                 State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4;  [2011]  2  AC
                 166, at [25] (under Article 3(1) of the  UN  Convention  on
                 the Rights of the Child the interests of the  child  are  a
                 primary consideration - i.e. an important matter - not  the
                 primary consideration). It is a factor relevant to the fair
                 balance between the individual and  the  general  community
                 which goes some way towards tempering  the  otherwise  wide
                 margin of appreciation available to the  state  authorities
                 in deciding what to do. The age of the child, the closeness
                 of their relationship with the other family member  in  the
                 United Kingdom and whether the family could  live  together
                 elsewhere are likely to be important factors  which  should
                 be borne in mind.


              v) If family life can be carried on elsewhere, it is  unlikely
                 that "a direct and immediate link" will exist  between  the
                 measures requested by an  applicant  and  his  family  life
                 (Draon, para. [106]; Botta v  Italy  (1998)  26  EHRR  241,
                 para. [35]), such as to provide the basis  for  an  implied
                 obligation upon the state under Article 8(1) to grant  LTE;
                 see also G�l v Switzerland, [42].


           40. In the light of these  authorities,  we  consider  that  the
           state has a wider margin  of  appreciation  in  determining  the
           conditions to be satisfied before LTE is  granted,  by  contrast
           with the position in relation to  decisions  regarding  LTR  for
           persons with a (non-precarious) family life already  established
           in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State  has  already,  in
           effect, made some use of this wider margin  of  appreciation  by
           excluding section EX.1 as a basis for grant of LTE, although  it
           is available as  a  basis  for  grant  of  LTR.  The  LTE  Rules
           therefore maintain, in general terms, a reasonable  relationship
           with the requirements of Article 8 in the ordinary run of cases.
           However,  it  remains  possible  to  imagine  cases  where   the
           individual interests at stake are  of  a  particularly  pressing
           nature so that a good claim for LTE can be  established  outside
           the Rules. In our view, the appropriate general formulation  for
           this category is that such cases will arise where  an  applicant
           for LTE can show that compelling circumstances exist (which  are
           not sufficiently recognised under the new Rules) to require  the
           grant of such leave....




34. On the matter of children it is apposite to note that Article 3 is  not
    the only provision of the CRC which may be relevant here.  Article 6(2)
    provides that  State  parties  shall  ensure,  to  the  maximum  extent
    possible, the survival and development of the child. By Article 9 State
    parties agree to respect the rights of the child to  maintain  personal
    relations and direct contact  with  both  parents  (except  where  such
    contact would be contrary to the child's best  interests).  Article  22
    specifically addresses the position of child refugees:


         Article 22


         "1. States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure that a
         child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a  refugee
         in accordance with applicable international  or  domestic  law  and
         procedures shall, whether unaccompanied or accompanied  by  his  or
         her parents or by any other person, receive appropriate  protection
         and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of  applicable  rights
         set forth in the present  Convention  and  in  other  international
         human rights or humanitarian instruments to which the  said  States
         are Parties.


         2. For this purpose, States Parties shall provide, as they consider
         appropriate, co-operation in any efforts by the United Nations  and
         other competent intergovernmental organizations or non-governmental
         organizations co-operating with the United Nations to  protect  and
         assist such a child and to trace the parents or  other  members  of
         the family of any refugee child  in  order  to  obtain  information
         necessary for reunification with his or her family. In cases  where
         no parents or other members of the family can be found,  the  child
         shall  be  accorded  the  same  protection  as  any   other   child
         permanently  or  temporarily  deprived  of  his   or   her   family
         environment  for  any  reason  ,  as  set  forth  in  the   present
         Convention."


35. In this context the Tribunal in AT (supra) further cites United Nations
    General Comment Number 6/2005, Treatment of Unaccompanied and Separated
    Children outside their Country of Origin.  Paragraph 79 of the  Comment
    states that the ultimate aim in addressing the  fate  of  unaccompanied
    children is to identify a durable  solution  which  wherever  possible,
    leads to that child not being separated any more.  Paragraph 82  points
    out that in the case of child  refugees  family  reunification  in  the
    country of origin is not in  the  best  interests  of  the  child:  the
    granting of refugee states constitutes a legally  binding  obstacle  to
    that  child's  return.   Paragraph  83  mandates   that   the   State's
    obligations under the CRC should govern its decision making  on  family
    reunification:

         States parties are particularly reminded that  "applications  by  a
         child or his or her parents to enter or leave a State party for the
         purpose of family reunification  shall  be  dealt  with  by  States
         parties in a positive, humane and expeditious manner"


36. Whilst I  note  that  the  CRC  and  associated  commentaries  are  not
    incorporated into United Kingdom law,  as  we  are  signatory  to  this
    international treaty it would  be  material  if  my  decision  were  in
    harmony with the aims and  principles  set  out  therein:  Mathieson  v
    Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2011] UKSC 4.


37. It is against that legal background that I make my findings.


38. Although I have set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  aside  for
    the errors identified above, the parties were  in  agreement  that  the
    detailed  record  of  the  oral  evidence  made  by  the  Tribunal  was
    unaffected by my  decision.    Mr  Bates  further  confirmed  that  the
    Respondent did not wish to challenge  any  of  the  written  or  expert
    evidence.   I could therefore accept all of the evidence at face value.
    The only issue between the parties is whether or not the facts disclose
    a sufficiently compelling case to conclude that the  refusal  of  entry
    would be disproportionate.


39. The first question I must ask is whether there is a family life between
    the Appellants and Sponsors such that a refusal to  grant  entry  might
    engage Article 8.  I note that neither the Entry Clearance Officer  nor
    First-tier Tribunal made a clear finding on this matter. Relevant to my
    enquiry are the following factors. Both S1 and S2 are  now  adults.  As
    such there can be no legal presumption that at the date of this  appeal
    they retain a  'family  life'  with  their  parents,  or  indeed  their
    siblings:  Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003]
    EWCA Civ 31.  Nor will the love and affection that the  Appellants  and
    Sponsors unsurprisingly hold for each other be sufficient to engage the
    Article: there must be something more.  Family life will be established
    between adult children and their parent and siblings where  it  can  be
    demonstrated that there is between them some form of  real,   committed
    and effective support.   That is not  to  introduce  a  requirement  of
    dependency, or exceptionality.  It all depends on the  facts:  per  Sir
    Stanley  Burnton  in Singh  v  Secretary  of  State  for   the   Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630 [at �24].


40. In the instant case I bear in mind that the Sponsors have  been  living
    apart from the Appellants for, respectively, 2 and 3 years.  Both  have
    demonstrated a certain degree of resilience in making their way  across
    the Middle East to Europe,  and  then  navigating  the  asylum  system.
    They do not live together. S2 lives with his aunt in Hatfield  but  her
    flat is small and she is unable to accommodate both of them so for  now
    S1 lives with his foster mother[1].   Those matters  notwithstanding  I
    am satisfied that the Sponsors have not ceased to have  a  family  life
    with the Appellants.  There continues to be a close bond  between  them
    and it clear from the evidence relating to S1  in  particular  that  he
    looks to his family in Lebanon for real emotional support. S1 speaks to
    his mother every single day, and the rest of the family  two  or  three
    times per week.  He is in daily social media contact with  C1  and  C2.
    S2 is also in daily contact the family in Lebanon and speaks of missing
    his mother's "soul". He is also conscious of how  much  he  misses  and
    needs his father whom he looks to for guidance.

41. I am satisfied, having regard  to  the  relatively  low  threshold  for
    engagement, that the decision does betray a lack  of  respect  for  the
    family life shared between the Appellants and Sponsors.

42. It is not in dispute that the decision was lawful, that is to say  that
    the Entry Clearance Officer had the power in law to make it.

43. I remind myself that Article 8 does not confer an  automatic  right  of
    entry. It will only be facts of a  particularly  pressing  nature  that
    will found a good claim under Article 8 to  be  allowed  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom to join family members already here  so  as  to  develop
    existing family life.   The facts must be compelling.

44. The Appellants are unable to meet the requirements of the rules.  As  I
    have canvassed above, this appears to be for no reason other  than  the
    fact that the Secretary of  State  has  not  seen  fit  to  lay  before
    parliament a rule providing for the family reunion of  child  refugees.
    The reason for that omission remains opaque.  Had the locations of  the
    various family members been transposed, there is  no  dispute  that  S1
    would have  qualified  for  leave  to  enter:  materially  he  has  not
    established an independent life, was under 18 at the date of  decision,
    no questions of exclusion arise and all concerned were part of the same
    household before the flight from Lebanon.  That is  a  matter  of  some
    relevance. The omission appears to be prima facie inconsistent with the
    United Kingdom's obligations under the CRC  and  indeed  the  statutory
    obligation under s.55 of the Borders Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
    2009.   I  have  taken  this  into  account,  whilst  recognising   the
    ordinarily wide margin of appreciation: SS (Congo).

45. A number of factors do however weigh against the Appellants:  s117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It is in  the  public
    interest that immigration control is maintained. This  is  because  the
    state has seen fit to control migration  into  the  United  Kingdom  in
    order to protect public resources and to promote social integration and
    cohesion. This is a large family and the potential costs  of  admitting
    all of the Applicants is striking - this is a family which will need to
    be housed, the children must be educated and  healthcare  provided.   I
    mention these matters not as an exhaustive list but as illustration  of
    how expensive it could end up being for the taxpayer. That is a  matter
    which attracts a substantial weight in the scales.   As  far  as  I  am
    aware none of the  Appellants  can  speak  English  to  any  degree  of
    fluency. This weighs against them, because it is in the public interest
    that people seeking to  settle  in  this  country  are  able  to  speak
    English, since this promotes their integration and lessens  the  burden
    on the state. There is no evidence before me to indicate  that  any  of
    the Appellants will be financially independent.   Again, to admit  them
    would for that reason by contrary to the public interest. A court  must
    be slow to find an implied  positive  obligation  which  would  involve
    imposing on the state significant  additional  expenditure.   It  might
    also be said - although I stress not  by  Mr  Bates,  and  so  this  is
    conjecture on my part - that to admit them would be to fill the gap  in
    the immigration rules that I have  identified,  and  the  Secretary  of
    State may well have sound public policy reasons for not  providing  for
    such a class of applicant: she may wish, for  instance,  to  discourage
    the migration of unaccompanied children.


46. I have taken all of those matter into account. Against them I weigh the
    following matters.

47. This was a pre-existing family life. In Lebanon the whole family  lived
    together, sharing loving and close relationships with  each  other.  As
    such this is not a case where I need consider the status of any of  the
    parties  when  the  relationships  were  formed.   In  the  context  of
    Palestinian culture the expectation and norm would be that all children
    of the family would remain living at home as part of that  family  unit
    after they reach majority. Girls will stay at home  until  they  marry,
    but for boys the practice would be for them to  remain  in  the  family
    home indefinitely, even after they marry and  have  children  of  their
    own.

48. That family life  was  interrupted  not  by  choice,  but  by  fear  of
    persecution. S2 and then S1 left their family home because they had to.
    This has been recognised by the Secretary of  State  in  the  grant  of
    refugee status.  The older boys' departure is  described  variously  by
    members of the family as "painful" and "heartbreaking".

49. This is not a family life that can be continued anywhere  else.  Whilst
    my decision has necessarily focused on the fact  that  S1  and  S2  are
    refugees, it is also relevant to note that in fact they, in common with
    the rest of their family, were already refugees. They are  Palestinians
    permitted to live in Lebanon. They all live  in  a  refugee  camp,  and
    always have done. I was shown no evidence, and certainly the Respondent
    did not suggest, that they would able to gain entry or leave to  remain
    in any other country to enable them to be reunited with S1 and S2.

50. The  family  in  Lebanon  are  living  in  precarious  and  frightening
    circumstances.  The witness statements describe how the family  managed
    over the years to eke  out  a  relatively  comfortable  existence.  The
    adults managed to bring in an income, and the children were able to  go
    to a  better,  privately  paying,  school  outside  of  the  camp.  The
    unchallenged evidence in the statements  is  that  this  situation  has
    deteriorated in recent years. Political instability in Lebanon has seen
    the economy decline and  this  has  unsurprisingly  had  an  impact  on
    refugees as well as the indigenous  community.  The  camp  is  becoming
    increasingly overcrowded and A2 reports there to be a "complete lack of
    security or protection". Nor have the  problems  with  local  Hezbollah
    figures dissipated as the family had  hoped.  None  of  the  Appellants
    suggest that the harassment encountered by C1 and C2 has yet reached  a
    level where it could be said that the have been  persecuted,  but  they
    are understandably very afraid of the animosity towards them from  this
    family: they are refugees with no power, influence or weapons,  whereas
    this family are locally connected,  powerful  and  armed.  I  find  the
    incidents described in the witness statements to be entirely  credible:
    they are consistent with the history already known and established, and
    there is nothing to indicate any exaggeration. As Ms Knorr submits,  if
    they had intended to fabricate a claim  that  they  were  in  immediate
    mortal danger, they could have done.


51. Each witness statement speaks of the emotional pain that the separation
    of this family is causing to all of them.  What is striking however  is
    how hard all of this is for A2, the mother of the family.   It  is  not
    difficult to accept that the mother of children sent  away  to  another
    continent in these circumstances will feel a terrible torment: she will
    miss them, worry about them, and feel desperately impotent  and  guilty
    about the fact that they were forced to leave.   The witness statements
    report that A2 "cries all the time" and that her physical  as  well  as
    mental health has declined.   She is diabetic and the stress is  making
    her condition much more difficult  to  manage.    She  has  started  to
    experience heart palpitations. This decline in her overall health is in
    turn having a detrimental impact on the children that remain with  her.
     Her husband A1 says that she wakes in the night having had  nightmares
    and that she is refusing food.  A2 has been seen by a  psychiatrist  Dr
    Fadel Shihimi, who confirms that she is suffering from  depression  and
    other, unspecified psychological problems.

52. The impact of separation on S1 in particular  is  severe.    Whilst  Dr
    Heke is of the opinion that his co-morbid psychological conditions  are
    rooted in various problems - including  his  traumatic  experiences  in
    Lebanon - she identifies his ongoing  fear  for  his  family,  and  his
    dislocation from them, as being "the most significant" factor:

         "[S1] cannot cope with the  separation  from  his  family,  and  is
         overwhelmed  with  worry  about  his  parents  and  siblings  which
         exacerbates his depressed mood. Clearly the significant loss of not
         being  able  to  be  with  his  parents  has  contributed  to   and
         exacerbated his vulnerability  to  developing  these  psychological
         problems"

53.  Dr Heke  recommends  that  S1  commence  trauma-focused  psychological
    therapy as soon as possible, but she is of the opinion  that  continued
    separation from his family continues to be the "biggest barrier to  his
    recovery", since treatment for his PTSD is  unlikely  to  be  effective
    without their support.  She goes so far as  to  raise  a  concern  that
    there may be a risk of  suicide  if  the  situation  is  not  resolved:
    "hopelessness is the most  significant  factor  related  to  acting  on
    suicidal thoughts".  Even absent such a risk she believes that a  final
    negative decision would have long term  consequences  for  S1's  mental
    health and could lead to "life-long problems".   She believes  that  at
    present he is only able to cope with his  mental  health  problems  "by
    holding onto the hope that he will be reunited with his family".

54. Dr Heke's assessment is entirely consistent with  other  observers  who
    know S1 well. S2 says that his brother is "sad all  of  the  time"  and
    that when they speak of their mother he cries. S2 does not  think  that
    S1 is coping at all.  The efforts that S2 is making to try and help  S1
    are often rejected because his  depression  is  such  that  he  has  no
    motivation to do anything.  Aunt describes S1 has being  a  "funny  and
    lighthearted" boy when she used to visit him  in  Lebanon.  She  writes
    that he was active and positive - now he just cries and  appears  upset
    and tired.  S1's foster  carer  describes  him  as  being  unhappy  and
    stressed; she is in regular  contact  with  Aunt  about  her  concerns.
    Similarly the boys' mother A2 comments that she  fears  that  her  sons
    have lost their ambition since they came  to  the  United  Kingdom.  S1
    always wanted  to  be  an  engineer  or  a  lawyer  but  has  lost  all
    motivation. S2 always did well at school and worked hard  but  has  now
    settled for a plumbing course, which she sees as out of character.

55. S1 himself says that he feels that his life is "empty without them  and
    there's a hole that can't be filled". He is unable to  concentrate  for
    any length of time and this has adversely effected his school work - he
    failed the exams he sat shortly before the First-tier Tribunal hearing.
     He feels tired all the time and has no energy. He  cries  every  night
    and finds it difficult to sleep. When he does manage to  drift  off  he
    often dreams about his other. He  feels  unable  to  eat  and  has  had
    episodes of spontaneous vomiting which Dr  Heke  considers  are  likely
    stress related.  S1 writes "the only thing that gets me through  is  my
    belief in God and my faith that with him I will see my  family  again".
    In respect of the family's ongoing problems in Lebanon S1 explains that
    his own issues only started as he got  older  -  as  C1  and  C2  reach
    adulthood he is extremely frightened that they will in turn be targeted
    and that the harassment they have recently experience will  get  worse.
    He is really concerned for his sister because he  fears  she  could  be
    targeted for sexual harassment.  He writes:

         "There's a chance that if the court refuses their appeal I could go
         crazy and do something like go back to Lebanon. It would put me  at
         risk of being killed, but if I stayed here  without  them  my  life
         would be destroyed anyway, so it would be better to die being  with
         them".

    I note that the First-tier Tribunal read this as a "threat". I find  it
    to be entirely consistent with all of  the  evidence  about  S1's  very
    desperate and low state of mind.


56. I have read Dr Heke's assessment mindful that S1 is not entirely  alone
    in the United Kingdom. He has his brother, with whom he is very  close,
    his foster mother with whom he enjoys a good relationship, his aunt and
    a college friend to whom he can turn: this  boy  is  a  Syrian  refugee
    separated  from  his  own  family  so  understands  S1's  problems.  S1
    describes being happy when he sees Aunt and  S2  but  states  that  the
    problem is that he often feels so low he does not have  the  motivation
    to go and see them. He loves his aunt but he  also  finds  it  hard  to
    spend time with her because she reminds him of his mother.


57. In her original report Dr Heke opines that the prognosis for S1, should
    the family be reunited, is likely to be good. She identifies  a  number
    of factors leading her to that conclusion.  The  fact  that  he  had  a
    healthy attachment relationship with his parents growing up, means that
    with their support he will be able  to  engage  meaningfully  with  his
    recovery. If they are with him in the United Kingdom he will no  longer
    be preoccupied with worry about their fate and will be able to focus on
    the future  rather  than  dwelling  on  his  past,  and  the  traumatic
    experiences that this entails.

58. Since the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Dr Heke  has  prepared  a
    second report, dated and admitted into the evidence under Rule 15  (2A)
    of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  Having  re-
    evaluated S1 Dr Heke maintains her diagnosis of very severe  PTSD,  but
    finds that applying the diagnostic criteria his level of depression and
    anxiety has now been elevated from moderate to severe.

59.  Finally,  I  consider  matters  arising  under  s.55  of  the  Borders
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. As  the  five  children  in  this
    appeal are all out  of  the  United  Kingdom  there  was  no  statutory
    obligation  upon  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  conduct  a  'best
    interests' assessment, but in line  with  published  policy,  this  was
    done. The outcome was the unsurprising conclusion that it would in  the
    children's best interests to  remain  living  with  their  parents.  No
    express consideration is given to the case advanced by the  Appellants.
    That case, put simply, is that without family reunification this family
    will continue to fracture and decline in fortunes. The parents are both
    devastated by their separation from  their  sons,  and  the  mother  in
    particular has suffered serious mental  and  physical  consequences  of
    that distress. I accept that it is contrary to the best interests of C1-
    C5 to see their mother in that state.  The elder children are obviously
    aware of the difficulties that the family has had with Hezbollah and  I
    accept that going to school every day in fear is likely to be  strongly
    contrary to their best interests.

60. Further it is extremely unlikely that S1 -  a  child  at  the  date  of
    application - will be able to fulfil his potential as a human being. In
    common with the claimant in AT & Anr, his will  be  a  "disfunctioning,
    debilitated and under achieving" family. As McCloskey J puts  it:  "the
    under performance of family members and family units, in this  respect,
    does not further any identifiable public interest. On the  contrary  it
    is antithetical to strong and stable societies".

61.  I  remind  myself  that  ordinarily  the  weight  to  be  attached  to
    maintaining the public interest in refusing leave to seven  people  who
    do not otherwise qualify for entry is immense. Even assuming that  each
    of the children in this family grows up to make a positive contribution
    to our society the cost to the taxpayer is likely to be  very  high.  I
    also bear in mind that these appeals concern applications for leave  to
    enter and that in those circumstances the  margin  of  appreciation  is
    ordinarily  wide.    The  question   remains   whether   the   negative
    consequences for the people concerned can be said to be  "unjustifiably
    harsh", disproportionate or to disclose, in the Respondent's  preferred
    formulation, "exceptionally compelling circumstances".  I am satisfied,
    having had regard to all of the foregoing that  these  high  tests  are
    met.

62. The consequences for the children involved is negative in the  extreme.
    Left in the insecurity of the refugee camp they are likely  to  witness
    their mother's mental and physical health further decline. They will be
    left as young children to  deal  with  the  emotional  consequences  of
    separation from their brothers who, absent success  in  these  appeals,
    they  are  very  unlikely  to  ever  see  again  in  the  flesh.    The
    consequences for the Sponsors in this country, and in particular S1, is
    equally harsh. All of the evidence - from S1 himself,  from  those  who
    know him best and from an experienced Consultant Psychologist - is that
    this teenager is suffering extreme  and  debilitating  mental  illness,
    which would be  immediately  and  significantly  improved  if  he  were
    permitted to reunite with his family. I am unable to see  any  positive
    outcome for S1 if these appeals are dismissed. There appears to  be  no
    prospect of him recovering from PTSD and his associated depression  and
    anxiety whilst he remains terrified for his family,  and  misses  their
    presence in the way that he does. Conversely Dr Heke  believes  that  a
    meaningful recovery is likely should family reunification  take  place.
    This is a young refugee whose hopes of qualifying in a profession  such
    as engineering or law have receded, but may well come  back  into  view
    should he regain hope.  I am accordingly satisfied that  the  decisions
    to refuse entry were strongly contrary to the best interests of all  of
    the children involved, and although this is no  trump  card,  it  is  a
    primary consideration capable of narrowing the margin of  appreciation:
    SS (Congo).


63. I have further weighed in  the  balance  the  United  Kingdom's  stated
    commitment to the family reunification of refugees; the fact that  this
    family were separated not by choice but by the threat of serious  harm,
    and crucially that there is no prospect of family life being  continued
    anywhere else. The likely  consequence  of  the  Respondent's  decision
    would be the nullification of any kind  of  normal  family  life  going
    forward.

64. Taking all of this into account  I  am  satisfied  that  the  continued
    refusal of entry clearance  would  for  this  family  be  unjustifiably
    harsh, disproportionate and so unlawful under s6(1) of the Human Rights
    Act 1998. The appeals must accordingly be allowed.


    Anonymity Order

65. This appeal concerns children, and refugees.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellants and Sponsors in this case  are  granted  anonymity.   No
        report of these proceedings shall directly or  indirectly  identify
        them or any other member of this family.   This  direction  applies
        to,  amongst  others,  both  the  Appellants  and  the  Respondent.
        Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of
        court proceedings"


    Decisions


66. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  errors  of  law  such
    that it must be set aside in its entirety.


67. The decision in the appeals are remade  as  follows:  the  appeals  are
    allowed on human rights grounds.

68. In view of the fact  that  this  is  an  appeal  involving  the  family
    reunification  of  children  I  would  respectfully  request  that  the
    Respondent expedite processing of this decision.

69. There is an order for anonymity.
