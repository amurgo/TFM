                                                                  Respondent

Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Alam, Haider & Hasan

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the secretary of state  and  to  the
      respondent as the claimant.

   2. The secretary of state appeals with permission against the decision of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge  Phull,  promulgated  on  1  December  2018,
      allowing the claimant's appeal against the decision of  the  secretary
      of state to refuse his application for indefinite leave to  remain  in
      the UK on the basis of ten years' long residence.

   3. The claimant's application, made on 16 July 2016 for indefinite  leave
      to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, was varied on 9 May  2017  to
      an application for indefinite leave to remain  on  the  basis  of  ten
      years' long residence [2].

   4. His application was refused on 14 March  2018  pursuant  to  paragraph
      322(5) of the Immigration Rules. The basis for the  refusal  was  that
      for the tax year ending April 2011 the claimant declared gross  income
      from self employment  of  �8348,  a  net  income  of  �7462  which  is
      significantly lower than the net income of �36,988.36 he claimed  when
      making  his  Tier  1  (General)  application  on  5  April  2011.  The
      respondent contends that the initial declared  income  to  HMRC  would
      have equated to zero points in the previous earnings category  on  his
      Tier 1 (Migrant) application dated 5 April 2011  rather  than  the  20
      points that he claimed.

   5. HMRC data confirmed that on 10 May 2016 they received an amended 2010-
      2011 tax return from the appellant declaring the said  increase.  This
      original return was filed on 28 January 2012.

   6. The fact that he retrospectively declared these  claimed  earnings  to
      HMRC four years after his original tax return  was  filed  in  January
      2012, and approximately two months prior to submitting his application
      for indefinite leave did not satisfy the secretary of  state  that  he
      had not previously been deceitful or dishonest in  his  dealings  with
      HMRC and/or UK Visas & Immigration. There  would  have  been  a  clear
      benefit to him either by failing to declare  these  full  earnings  to
      HMRC with respect  to  reducing  his  tax  liability,  or  by  falsely
      representing his earnings to UKVI to enable him  to  meet  the  points
      required to obtain leave to remain under the Tier 1 (General  Migrant)
      Scheme.

   7. Although he has provided a copy of  a  letter  dated  8  October  2014
      addressed to HMRC, that document cannot be relied upon as he  provided
      no documentary evidence in his application to  demonstrate  that  this
      letter was ever sent to or received by HMRC.

   8. It was his responsibility to ensure that his tax return was  submitted
      on time with the correct information and by failing to  do  so  it  is
      considered that he has been deceitful or  dishonest  in  his  dealings
      with HMRC and/or UKVI.

      The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

   9. In a decision promulgated on 11  December  2018,  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Phull allowed the claimant's  appeal.  She  found  that  he  had
      provided a reasonable explanation with documentary evidence and  there
      was  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  he  has  been  involved  in  any
      criminality [18].

  10. She found on balance that his calls to HMRC and their advice  did  not
      call into question his character, conduct and associations. She  found
      him to be a credible witness.

  11. She noted the  secretary  of  state's  contention  that  the  claimant
      submitted his tax return for 2010-2011 on 10 May 2016, which  is  four
      years and three months after his  original  tax  return  filed  on  28
      January 2012.

  12. She found at [14] however that the letter of 8 October 2014 refers  to
      the amended tax return as attached, and therefore found that this  was
      submitted to HMRC in  2014.  There  was  a  further  letter  dated  12
      November 2014 from the claimant to the  respondent  referring  to  the
      fact that the amended tax return being submitted on 8 October 2014 had
      attached the SA 302 employment history and letter to HMRC as  well  as
      the tax return. The 2012-2013 revised tax calculation showed that  tax
      was deducted.

      The appeal to the Upper Tribunal

  13. On 11 January 2019,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to  appeal  on  the  basis  that  it  is
      arguable that the approach taken by the Judge did not  pay  sufficient
      attention to the guidance in R (on the application  of  Khan)  v  SSHD
      (Dishonesty: Tax Return: Paragraph 322(5)) [2018]  UKUT  00384  (IAC),
      and did not fully  address  the  figures  and  reasons  given  by  the
      claimant for re-opening his tax affairs and the timing of events.

  14. Ms Isherwood on behalf of the  secretary  of  state  referred  to  the
      grounds seeking permission to appeal. She submitted that  Judge  Phull
      failed to take into account or resolve a conflict of fact  or  opinion
      on a material matter. She failed to resolve the issues of whether  the
      claimant acted dishonestly by either over declaring his income to UKVI
      in his leave to remain applications, or whether he under declared  his
      income to HMRC in order to reduce his tax bill. The Judge  incorrectly
      focused on the fact that he amended his tax return and paid tax owed.

  15. The findings do not address the reasons for why the claimant sought to
      amend his tax returns. Nor did she address why there was such a  large
      delay in seeking to address this issue or the reasons why  there  were
      such large discrepancies in his declared income to UKVI and HMRC.

  16. She submitted that Judge Phull failed to apply the  reasoning  of  the
      Upper Tribunal decision in  R  (on  the  application  of  Khan),  when
      assessing whether the claimant acted dishonestly in  relation  to  his
      dealings with UKVI or HMRC. In particular,  she  did  not  follow  the
      recommended steps in Khan  when  assessing  his  actions  and  focused
      solely on whether he has repaid money to HMRC.

  17. She submitted that the Judge has not provided reasons for  why  it  is
      accepted that the claimant would not have  been  aware  of  the  error
      sooner, given that his  tax  liability  would  have  been  lower  than
      expected and why this was not rectified sooner. It was thus a material
      error in the assessment of his actions.

  18. In addition, Judge Phull erred in  referring  to  Home  Office  policy
      guidance and finding at [16] that as the claimant has not  been  found
      guilty of any criminal activity,  paragraph  322(5)  does  not  apply.
      There has been a significant difference between the income claimed  in
      a previous application for leave to remain and the income declared  to
      HMRC. The secretary of state is entitled to draw an inference that  he
      has been deceitful.

  19. Ms Isherwood referred to  the  detailed  chronology  set  out  in  the
      reasons for refusal. It is not evident that the Judge dealt  with  the
      fact that the claimant made an earlier application on  a  false  basis
      and was accordingly not entitled to the points claimed.

  20. She referred to the paragraphs in the headnote in Khan.  There  was  a
      significant difference between the  income  claimed  in  the  previous
      application and that declared to HMRC. The  claimant  is  expected  to
      have known of his earnings. In a nutshell, the Judge did not  properly
      deal with the fact that the claimant obtained leave on a false basis.

  21. In reply, Mr Alam, who represented the claimant before the  First-tier
      Tribunal, noted that in the reasons  for  refusal,  the  secretary  of
      state referred to the claimant's explanation. The Judge  had  to  deal
      with this.

  22. At page 4 of the reasons for refusal the secretary of  state  referred
      to the claimant's answer to question 14 of the  tax  questionnaire  he
      filled in: He was asked whether he ever needed to correct or  resubmit
      his tax return during any period of his self employment  to  which  he
      answered 'yes'.  He  claimed  that  the  reason  his  tax  return  was
      incorrectly submitted was "confusion of fiscal  and  financial  years"
      which he stated was discovered  "in  2013  when  HMRC  sent  some  tax
      payable." He stated  that  the  cause  of  the  error  was  "month  in
      different fiscal years," and he contacted HMRC for further advice.

  23. Mr Alam referred to the letter of support that the claimant  submitted
      with his completed questionnaire dated 12  November  2017.  In  it  he
      stated that he only submitted one month calculation to HMRC in January
      2012, and eleven months should have been adjusted in the  next  fiscal
      year. In the next fiscal year "I  did  not  work  on  self  employment
      basis. Again I sent it to HMRC as a small calculation  and  forgot  to
      adjust the remaining months."

  24. The secretary of state did not accept his explanation and referred  to
      a letter dated 8 October 2014 addressed to HMRC. That  document  could
      not be relied upon however  as  the  claimant  has  not  provided  any
      documentary evidence in his application to show that this  letter  was
      ever sent to or received by HMRC.

  25. Mr Alam submitted that the issue was when  the  claimant  amended  the
      records. It is asserted by the secretary of state that in his  amended
      2010-2011 tax return he submitted on 10 May  2016  that  there  was  a
      declaration of an increase in net earnings from self  employment  from
      �7462 to �36,988, which was being made four  years  and  three  months
      after his original tax return was filed on 28 January 2012.

  26. The claimant, however, has always asserted that he did not effect this
      amendment only about two months prior to submitting his application.

  27. In that respect, Mr Alam referred to two documents in the secretary of
      state's bundle. At G1, the claimant sent a letter to HMRC on 8 October
      2014 in which he stated that he  has  reviewed  his  income  tax  self
      assessment 2010-2011 and pointed out  a  mistake  in  his  online  tax
      return in his sales figures. The amount should be �45,336 but this was
      not declared. That affected the net profit which is now �36,988.

  28. He stated that he needs to amend this as soon as possible and when  he
      spoke to HMRC by telephone, one of the tax  advisers  there  suggested
      that he send a written letter mentioning the mistake.   He  "herewith"
      makes the amendment in the sales figures and enclosed the amended  tax
      return. He requested that appropriate  adjustments  be  made  and  the
      revised calculation for his tax consideration  be  given  as  soon  as
      possible so he can arrange a quick source to make the tax  payment  on
      time. He also asked for the reissue of the  SA  302  for  the  revised
      amount.

  29. Mr Alam submitted that the Judge did in fact refer to this  letter  in
      her decision at [14]  and  [16].  Moreover,  the  claimant  gave  oral
      evidence to this effect.

  30. The second document  Mr  Alam  referred  to  is  in  produced  in  the
      secretary of state's bundle at E1.  This  is  a  letter  sent  by  the
      claimant to the Home Office on 12 November 2017. In that letter, which
      he  headed  "Confusion",  the  claimant  asserted  that  he  was  self
      registered as a self employed person in 2010. His first financial year
      was 28 February 2011. Due to confusion in  fiscal  and  the  financial
      year, he only submitted a one month calculation  to  HMRC  in  January
      2012 and 11 months should be adjusted for the next fiscal year.

  31. The next fiscal year he did not  work  on  a  self  employment  basis.
      Again, he sent this to HMRC as  a  small  calculation  and  forgot  to
      adjust the remaining months. In September 2013 he realised  that  HMRC
      sent the tax calculation amount which was less  than  he  expected  to
      pay. He avers that he started contacting HMRC over the phone and  they
      did not understand him "for a long time".  Finally  one  of  the  HMRC
      advisers suggested to him that he should send an amended tax return of
      2010-2011, which was then sent in October 2014.

  32. Mr Alam submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge considered  these
      amendments and referred to them.  She  found  his  explanation  to  be
      credible. Having found that he made  mistakes,  his  conduct  was  not
      deceitful.

  33. The Judge noted at [5] that the claimant received a tax bill from HMRC
      in 2013, and at the end of that year, he contacted HMRC but  they  did
      not understand his query. In  2014  he  again  called  HMRC  and  they
      advised him to file an amended tax return for 2010-11  which  he  did,
      and submitted it in May 2016. The claimant has never  had  accountants
      assisting him.

  34. The secretary of state noted in the refusal letter that they  received
      an amended 2010-2011 tax return on 10 May 2016 declaring  an  increase
      in net earnings from self employment. It was open to the Judge to make
      the credibility findings that she did. She looked at  the  differences
      in the round. She accepted that there was  a  mistake  made  over  the
      fiscal years.

  35. He submitted that the challenge to the secretary of state 'has been to
      the factual findings and not the claimant's credibility'.

  36. Mr Amal referred to [32] in Khan, where  the  Judge  stated  that  the
      starting point  seemed  to  be  that  where  the  secretary  of  state
      discovers a significant difference between the income claimed and  the
      previous application for leave to remain and the  income  declared  to
      HMRC, she is entitled to draw an inference that the claimant has  been
      deceitful or dishonest and therefore she would be refused  ILR  within
      paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

  37. However, it does not follow that in  all  such  cases  a  decision  to
      refuse ILR will be lawful. Where an applicant has  presented  evidence
      to show that despite the prima facie inference  he  was  not  in  fact
      dishonest but only careless, the secretary of state is presented  with
      a fact finding task which must be carried out fairly and lawfully. She
      needs to remind  herself  that  a  finding  that  a  person  has  been
      deceitful and dishonest in  relation  to  his  tax  affairs  with  the
      consequence that he is denied settlement in this  country  is  a  very
      serious finding with serious consequences and therefore  the  evidence
      must be cogent and strong  although,  as  the  authorities  show,  the
      standard of proof remains on the balance of probabilities.

  38. He submitted that it is evident from the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
      decision that she was well aware of the correct approach to be taken.

      Assessment

  39. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Phull  guided  herself  appropriately  when
      determining  the  appeal  by  reference  to  the  respondent's  policy
      guidance of 11 January 2018 which was in force at the time [13].

  40. She noted the submission with regard to the burden of  proof  at  [9].
      Counsel on  the  claimant's  behalf  identified  the  issues,  namely,
      whether the claimant has been dishonest and whether the  secretary  of
      state has established that. The initial burden is on the secretary  of
      state.

  41. There is no  doubt  that  when  considering  the  credibility  of  the
      claimant, Judge Phull considered the explanation  of  the  failure  to
      declare income in 2010 which  was  well  below  that  which  he  later
      declared in May 2016. She had  regard  to  the  secretary  of  state's
      contentions that the claimant submitted his tax return  for  2010-2011
      on 10 May 2016, which  is  four  years  and  three  months  after  his
      original tax return filed on 28 January 2012. She noted that  in  2013
      he received a tax bill from HMRC and at the end of that year contacted
      HMRC who did not understand his query. A year later  he  again  called
      them and he was advised to submit an amended tax return for  2010-2011
      which he then submitted in May 2016. He did not have  any  accountants
      assisting him at the time.

  42. The claimant gave an explanation as to the "confusion" that arose.  He
      sent a letter to HMRC on 8 October 2014 in which he stated that he has
      reviewed his income tax self assessment 2010-2011  and  pointed  to  a
      mistake in his online tax return in his sales figures.  That  affected
      the net profit. He stated that he needed to  amend  this  as  soon  as
      possible and when he spoke to HMRC by telephone, a tax  adviser  there
      suggested that he send a written letter setting out the mistake.

  43. He then made an amendment in the sales figures and closed the  amended
      tax return.  It  was  the  claimant  who  requested  that  appropriate
      adjustments  be  made  and  the  revised  calculation  for   his   tax
      consideration be given as soon as possible so as to  arrange  a  quick
      source to make the tax payment on time.

  44. Judge  Phull  referred  to  these  letters  relating  to  revised  tax
      calculations both at [14] and [16]. The claimant also  gave  evidence,
      supported by a letter in the secretary of state's bundle at  E1  where
      he stated that he was self registered as a  self  employed  person  in
      2010. Due to confusion in the  fiscal  and  financial  year,  he  only
      submitted a one month calculation in January 2012 and 11 months should
      accordingly be adjusted for the next fiscal year. It was in 2013  that
      he realised that the HMRC tax calculation  figure  was  less  than  he
      expected to pay. He then started contacting them by telephone and they
      took a long time to understand.

  45. The secretary of state complains that the Judge did not pay sufficient
      attention to the guidance in  Khan  and  did  not  fully  address  the
      figures and the reasons given by the claimant for re-opening  his  tax
      affairs and the timing of the events.

  46. Whilst it is correct that  the  Judge  did  not  have  regard  to  the
      judicial review decision in R (on the application  of  Khan)  v  SSHD,
      supra, the decision in Shen (Paper appeals; proving dishonesty) [2014]
      UKUT 00236 was produced to her. The Tribunal in Shen  also  considered
      the inference  to  be  drawn  with  regard  to  deliberate  deception,
      concluding that it is always open to a claimant to proffer an innocent
      explanation  and  if  that  explanation  meets  a   basic   level   of
      plausibility, the burden switches back to the secretary  of  state  to
      answer that evidence. At the end of the day, the  secretary  of  state
      bears the burden of proving dishonesty.

  47. Having set out all the relevant evidence, Judge Phull found  that  the
      explanation that the claimant gave with regard  to  amending  his  tax
      return was plausible. There  was  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the
      claimant had been involved in any criminality and his calls  to  HMRC,
      and their advice, does not call into question his  character,  conduct
      and associations.

  48. Unlike Khan,  the  claimant  did  not  blame  an  accountant  for  the
      "mistake" with regard to the historic tax returns. Mr Justice  Spencer
      held in Khan that where there is a significant difference between  the
      income claimed in a previous application for leave to remain  and  the
      income declared to HMRC, the secretary of state is entitled to draw an
      inference that he has been deceitful or dishonest and that  he  should
      be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5) of the Rules. Such an inference
      could be expected where there is  no  plausible  explanation  for  the
      discrepancy.

  49. Where the applicant has presented evidence to show  that  despite  the
      prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but only careless,
      the secretary of state must then decide whether  the  explanation  and
      evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to  displace  the  prima  facie
      inference of deceit/dishonesty.

  50. In considering whether he has been dishonest, regard must also be  had
      to the steps he has taken to remedy the situation and if so, when they
      were taken and the explanation for any significant delay.

  51. Judge Phull was satisfied that it was not merely an assertion that the
      appellant was making. She had regard to the  steps  he  had  taken  to
      remedy the situation  as  long  ago  as  2013/2014  and  had  produced
      consistent documentation, including letters between himself and  HMRC.
      This evidence was considered by the Judge.

  52. In the circumstances, the conclusion that the  claimant's  explanation
      of the error was plausible and that he had not been deceptive,  was  a
      decision that  was  rationally  open  to  Judge  Phull  on  the  facts
      presented and was sufficiently reasoned.

  53. In summary, Judge Phull has properly and lawfully  addressed  the  key
      substantial issues in the appeal, namely, whether the claimant  is  of
      good character, given the allegation of dishonesty relating to his tax
      return. It was lawfully open to her  to  allow  the  appeal  on  human
      rights grounds, having found that the claimant had shown that he could
      meet the requirements of paragraph 276B of the Immigration  Rules  and
      that there would accordingly be no  public  interest  in  his  removal
      given that he had been lawfully  in  the  UK  for  ten  years,  speaks
      English and is financially independent.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making  of
      an error on a point of law. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      allowing the appeal on human rights grounds is upheld.


      No anonymity direction is made.
