                                     and


                 secretary of state for the home department

                                                                  Respondent
Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Bellara, counsel (instructed by Waterfords
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant appealed with permission against  the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 16 June 2016, dismissing his  claim
      for permanent residence pursuant to the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
      2006.


   2. At the hearing before the Upper  Tribunal  on  22  February  2017  the
      representatives agreed that the decision contained a procedural  error
      of law, namely, that in the circumstances disclosed, the  Judge  ought
      to have acceded to the respondent's  request  for  an  adjournment  to
      consider the payslips that had been produced.  Moreover, the Judge had
      also  erred  when  raising  matters  concerning  the  sponsor's   past
      employment which had never been disputed by the respondent.


   3. At the hearing on 22 February 2017, Mr Bellara produced  to  Mr  Singh
      the original payslips, a letter as well as HMRC documents.


   4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was accordingly set aside. The
      appellant was given permission to file any further  evidence  relating
      to his former spouse's employment.


      The resumed hearing on 3 May 2017


   5. At the commencement of the hearing, Mr Singh informed me that  he  had
      received a witness statement dated 28 March 2017 from an officer of HM
      Revenue  and  Customs,  Mr  Robert  Evans,  following   requests   for
      information received from law enforcement agencies.


   6. Mr Evans stated that he is authorised to make a disclosure under  s.40
      of the UK Borders  Act  2007  in  respect  of  HMRC  computer  records
      specified in the request.


   7. The information that he provided  related  to  [MM],  the  appellant's
      former spouse, born on 12 June 1984. Her National Insurance number and
      residential address had been given.


   8. The officer confirmed  that  for  the  tax  year  2013-14  she  earned
      �15996.99 (gross) from employment;  for  the  tax  year  2014-15,  she
      received �16462.50 and that  for  2015-16,  she  earned  �17,004.  The
      information disclosed the identity of her employer, [BM] & [JB].


   9. Mr Singh accepted that in the light of the evidence now  produced,  it
      has been shown that the appellant's former spouse had been working for
      the entire period between 2011 and 2015.  In the circumstances I  find
      that the appellant satisfied the relevant requirements under the  2006
      Regulations.


      Notice of Decision


      Having set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, I re-make it
      and substitute a decision allowing the appellant's  appeal  under  the
      2006 Regulations.


      No anonymity direction is made.


      Signed                             Dated: 16 May 2017


      Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge C R Mailer
