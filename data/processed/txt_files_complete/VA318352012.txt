                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Holder)  which  allowed  the  claimant's
    appeal against a refusal to grant her  entry  clearance  as  a  visitor
    under para 41 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 2. For convenience, hereafter I refer to the parties as they  were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Kenya who was born on  11  October  1986.
    On 26 June 2012 she married a British citizen, Nigel Davies  in  Kenya.
    On 16 July 2012, she made an application to visit her spouse in the UK.
     On 6 August 2012, the ECO refused the appellant's application.  He did
    so on the basis that he was not satisfied  that  the  appellant  was  a
    genuine visitor who intended to leave the UK at the end  of  her  visit
    and so she had not established that she met the  requirements  in  para
    41(i) and (ii) of the Rules.  The ECO's reasons were as follows:

         "You state you seek entry clearance to  visit  your  spouse  for  6
         months.  You have provided evidence  you  married  your  spouse,  a
         British citizen, on  26/06/2012.   Whilst  I  accept  your  sponsor
         intends to fund your visit, it is your intentions and circumstances
         I  must  consider  when  assessing  your  application   for   entry
         clearance.

         You are currently unemployed  and  dependent  on  your  sponsor  to
         support you in Kenya.  You have  no  property,  no  assets  and  no
         income.  You state you intend to visit for 6  months,  the  maximum
         allowable time on a visit visa; however you have  provided  nothing
         with your application to suggest you have any reason to  leave  the
         UK, particularly as your newly married husband resides  permanently
         in Gwent.

         In light of these things, I consider that you have not demonstrated
         sufficiently strong family, social or economic ties  to  your  home
         country to satisfy me of your intentions in the UK.

         I am not satisfied that your personal circumstances are as  stated.
         I am not satisfied that  you  are  genuinely  seeking  entry  as  a
         visitor for a limited period not exceeding 6  months  or  that  you
         intend to leave the United Kingdom at  the  end  of  the  visit  as
         required by paragraph 41(i) and (ii).

         I  have  therefore  refused  your  application  because  I  am  not
         satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you  meet  all  of
         the requirements of the relevant Paragraph of  the  United  Kingdom
         Immigration Rules."

 4. On 18  February  2013,  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  confirmed  that
    decision.

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  She did not request
    an oral hearing and the appeal was determined on the  papers  by  Judge
    Holder on 21 June 2013.  The judge allowed the appellant's appeal.  His
    reasons for doing so can be found at paras 13-17 of  his  determination
    as follows:

         "13. The issue in  this  appeal  is  that  the  Respondent  is  not
             satisfied that the Appellant has shown that she is  a  genuine
             visitor or will leave the United Kingdom on completion of  the
             proposed visit.

         14.  The Appellant married her sponsor,  Nigel  Davies,  who  is  a
             British citizen.  They married in Kenya on 26th June 2012.

             His financial and personal standing are not challenged by  the
             Respondent.  He will finance the Appellant's trip and  provide
             accommodation.

         15.  I find from  the  application  form  that  the  Appellant  was
             unemployed at the time of the application and had little money
             of her own.  Nevertheless, I find that it is probable that she
             does have emotional ties to Kenya given that her family reside
             there.

             She does not have an adverse immigration record save that  she
             was refused a visa to work as a home  help  in  Germany  as  a
             consequence being over the age limit.  There is no evidence of
             her overstaying in another country.  She has a valid reason to
             visit the United Kingdom given her marriage to the sponsor.

             She states that she will return to Kenya at  the  end  of  her
             stay and any application for  settlement  will  be  made  from
             Kenya.

         16.  I find, given the cumulative effect  of  the  afore-mentioned,
             that it is probable that the Appellant is  a  genuine  visitor
             who intends to return to Kenya at  the  end  of  her  proposed
             visit.

         17.  I find that she has shown that she meets the  requirements  of
             paragraph 41(i) and (ii) of HC 395."

 6. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal  on  the  basis
    that the judge had failed to give adequate reasons  for  his  findings.
    On 5 July 2013, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Robertson)  granted  the
    ECO permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the  basis  that  the
    judge had arguably erred in law.  The arguable error is set out in para
    2 of the grant of permission to appeal as follows:

         "2.  In the grounds, it is submitted that the Judge, in arriving at
             his assessment of whether or not the Appellant would leave the
             UK at the end of her visit, erred in failing to give  adequate
             reasons for his decision that any emotional attachment she may
             feel to Kenya because her family lived there was greater  than
             her attachment to her husband  who  lived  in  the  UK.   This
             ground is arguable."

 7. Thus, the appeal came before me.

 8. The appellant has no legal  representative  and  the  sponsor  did  not
    appear at the hearing.  It is  clear  from  the  Tribunal's  file  that
    notice of the hearing was sent to the sponsor at his correct address on
    12 September 2013.  In the circumstances, I exercised my discretion  to
    hear the appeal in the absence of the appellant under rule  38  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698)  in  the
    interests of justice.

 9. Mr Hibbs, who represented the  ECO,  relied  upon  the  grounds  and  a
    skeleton argument he submitted on the day of the hearing.  He submitted
    that the judge had failed to provide adequate reason for  finding  that
    the appellant's emotional attachment to her family and life without any
    income or employment in Kenya were greater than her attachment  to  her
    husband such that she would leave the UK at the end  of  a  visit.   He
    also submitted that the judge had failed to take into account that  the
    appellant had been refused a visa to live in Germany less  than  twelve
    months before.  He submitted that the judge had  failed  to  apply  the
    balance of probabilities test and had given the appellant  the  benefit
    of the doubt rather than  weighing  the  evidence  in  the  round.   He
    submitted that the judge had failed to take  a  holistic  look  at  the
    circumstances including all the adverse factors.

10. First, it is clear the judge applied the balance of probabilities test.
     He expressly sets that out at para 6 of his determination and there is
    no basis for finding that he did not have that fully in  mind  when  he
    made his findings at paras 14-17.

11. Secondly, the judge did take into account that the appellant  had  been
    refused a visa to work in Germany solely on the basis that she was over
    the age limit for such visas.  The judge was fully entitled to conclude
    that she had no "adverse immigration record" apart from that and  there
    was no evidence of her overstaying in another country.

12. Thirdly, the judge noted that the  appellant  was  unemployed  and  had
    little money of her own.  He was entitled to find that, having lived in
    Kenya where she had family since her birth in  October  1986,  she  had
    "emotional ties" to Kenya.

13. Fourthly, the judge took into account the appellant's evidence that she
    would return at the end of her stay as  set  out  in  her  application.
    There was, of course, no interview in this case.

14. Fifthly, the judge noted in para 4 of his determination  that  he  took
    into account the documents in both  the  respondent's  and  appellant's
    bundle.  Contained in those bundles, is a letter of  support  from  the
    appellant's husband dated 14 July 2012 in which he states that he is  a
    British citizen and a class 1 lorry driver working in South Wales.   He
    states that he is able to accommodate the appellant  during  her  stay.
    Also, in her application the appellant states that the sponsor will  be
    responsible for her accommodation and  also  will  pay  for  her  visit
    (�1,000).

15. The judge was entitled to take the view that the appellant did not have
    an adverse immigration history given that she was refused a  work  visa
    as a home help in Germany only because she was over the  permitted  age
    limit.  The judge had the evidence of the sponsor and also a number  of
    testimonial letters relating to the sponsor.  The judge was entitled to
    take into account that the appellant had "emotional  ties"  with  Kenya
    and, in effect, to accept her evidence set out in her application  that
    she intended to leave the UK at the end of  a  six  month  visit.   The
    judge took into account all the evidence before him.  He  was  entitled
    to find that the appellant was a genuine visitor who intended to return
    to Kenya at the end of  her  visit.   There  was  no  evidence  of  any
    immigration offending by the appellant.  She had made an application to
    visit her husband within a few weeks of marrying him in June 2012.

16. In Shizad  (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013]  UKUT  85  (IAC),
    the Upper Tribunal set out the well-accepted standard for assessing the
    "adequacy" of reasons for a judge's findings (at [10]):

         "We would emphasise that although there is a legal duty to  give  a
         brief explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on  which
         the appeal is determined, such reasons need not be extensive if the
         decision as a whole makes sense,  having  regard  to  the  material
         accepted by the judge.  Although a decision may contain an error of
         law where the requirements to give adequate reasons  are  not  met,
         this Tribunal would not normally set aside a decision of the First-
         tier Tribunal where there has been no misdirection of law, the fact-
         finding process cannot  be  criticised  and  the  relevant  Country
         Guidance is taken into account, unless  the  conclusions  that  the
         judge draws from the primary data before him  were  not  reasonably
         open to him."

17. Taking into account all  the  evidence,  I  do  not  accept  Mr  Hibbs'
    submission that the judge  failed  to  give  adequate  reason  for  his
    positive finding in favour of the appellant.  The Judge's  reasons  are
    clear if concise. It may well not have been a finding which every judge
    would necessarily make on this evidence but it cannot be said that  his
    finding is perverse or irrational in that  no  reasonable  judge  could
    reach it.

18. For these reasons, the judge  did  not  err  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal under para 41 of the Immigration Rules.

19.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.
