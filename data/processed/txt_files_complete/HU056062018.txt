                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Miles  promulgated  on  12  November  2018  following  a
    hearing that took place on 25 September 2018.  In his determination the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge determined  that  he  was  not  satisfied  on
    balance of probabilities that the appellant had exercised dishonesty in
    failing  to  reveal  in  a  return  to  HMRC  what  was  an   undoubted
    understatement of his earnings, such that in subsequent  correspondence
    with HMRC he  accepted  that  there  was  an  additional  liability  of
    ï¿½10,858.

 2. I shall refer to Mr Zeb as "the appellant" as he was in the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 3. Mr Zeb is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 13 April  1971  and  he
    had applied for indefinite leave to  remain  on  the  basis  of  lawful
    residence.   The  Secretary  of  State  had   initially   relied   upon
    discrepancies in relation to three years of tax returns that  had  been
    earlier made by the appellant, but it was accepted on the part  of  the
    Secretary of State that it was only one year, the year 2010- 2011, that
    was relevant for the purposes of the Secretary  of  State's  submission
    that dishonesty had been used in what it was accepted an understatement
    of his income.  In the determination the judge records  that  he  heard
    the evidence of the appellant and the  appellant  himself  had  already
    provided a witness statement.  The crucial elements appear to  be  that
    in 2015, some eighteen  months  before  he  made  his  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain,  the  appellant  had  instructed  his  then
    accountants, Bradley & Cooper, to inform HMRC that a mistake  had  been
    made, as a result of which a subsequent  liability  to  pay  additional
    income tax was raised.

 4. The judge advised himself as to the correct approach  by  reference  to
    the reported decision in the case of Khan, R (on  the  application  of)
    Khan v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  (Dishonesty,  tax
    return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).  At that  stage  the
    judge was not aware that it had become a reported case, perhaps it  was
    not by then reported.  At any event, it  subsequently  became  reported
    and it is clear that, in paragraph 22 of his determination,  the  judge
    set out the relevant requirements.  He  applied  that  guidance  as  he
    stated in paragraph 23.  Accordingly, insofar as the grounds of  appeal
    in paragraph 1(h) assert that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not
    take into account the recommended approach of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Khan, that submission is not sustainable.   The  judge  did  take  into
    account what was said in Khan and expressly set it out in paragraph  22
    of his determination.  He then recorded  that  the  appellant  conceded
    that he had misstated his earnings in the relevant year and accordingly
    determined that the Secretary of State  had  prima  facie  evidence  of
    dishonesty on the basis that the appellant had signed a form which  was
    inaccurate.

 5. The judge then went on to consider whether there was an explanation for
    the discrepancy.  There was  an  explanation,  which  he  had  set  out
    previously. However, he  noted  that  there  were  limitations  to  the
    explanation that had been provided.  No evidence of correspondence  had
    passed between him and his former accountants.  In other  words,  there
    was no evidence of the instructions that he provided  to  those  former
    accountants, nor was there documentary evidence regarding  the  alleged
    illness on the part of his father.   I  am  bound  to  say  I  find  it
    difficult to see how that could result in a mistake in  a  tax  return.
    Nevertheless, that was a matter upon which the judge  plainly  did  not
    place inordinate weight, given the fact that there was no  evidence  to
    support it.

 6. He then referred to the fact that HMRC  had  itself  characterised  the
    appellant's conduct as careless rather than deliberate.  That too is  a
    thin ground of appeal in that,  in  the  case  of  Samant,  R  (on  the
    application of) Samant v The Secretary of State for the Home Department
    JR/6546/2016 and the similar case of Abatti JR/13807/2016, the Tribunal
    had suggested that only limited weight should be attached to  the  fact
    that the Revenue had decided not to raise a penalty.  Nevertheless,  it
    was a matter that the judge was entitled to take  into  account.   More
    importantly, the judge took into account the fact that the  application
    to  amend  the  accounts  was  not  prompted  by  the  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain, and therefore it could not be said that the
    only reason why he applied for a recalculation of his tax liability was
    because it suited him in the pursuit of indefinite leave to remain.  On
    the other hand, it appears that the decision to make the adjustment was
    made at a time when he was seeking a mortgage.  The  judge  knew  about
    that and, as he  said  in  paragraph  24,  he  found  the  case  finely
    balanced.

 7. The burden of establishing dishonesty rested on the respondent and  the
    appellant did not have to establish his honesty.  The reality  is  that
    the Secretary of State had already made out a prima facie case and  the
    question was whether or not the evidence of the appellant was such that
    it made out a plausible explanation, such that it  could  not  be  said
    that the respondent had on balance made out the case of dishonesty.  It
    may be that paragraphs 23 and 24 are not as carefully  worded  as  they
    might be, but it is  clear  that  the  result  of  this  was  that  the
    respondent, according to the judge, had failed to make out  the  charge
    of dishonesty.  In my judgement that was the  balancing  exercise  that
    the judge was required to do.  It was a decision that was open to  him,
    and certainly not one  I  can  find  flawed  when  the  judge  had  the
    assistance of hearing and considering the appellant's own evidence.

 8. In the course of the hearing Mr Walker properly conceded  that  it  was
    difficult for him to argue on behalf of the Secretary of State that the
    findings made by the judge were not properly open  to  him.   In  those
    circumstances I reject the appeal of the Secretary of State.

DECISION

      i) The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.

     ii) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge shall stand.
