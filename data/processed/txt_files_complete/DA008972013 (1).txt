                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  decision  of
        First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert OBE promulgated  on  the  19  May
        2015, following a hearing at Hendon Magistrates Court, in which  Mr
        Kabuga's appeal against the decision to deport him from the  United
        Kingdom pursuant to Section 5(1) Immigration Act 1971 was allowed.



Background


     2. Mr Kabuga was born in the United Kingdom on  27  October  1994  but
        remains a citizen  of  Uganda.   Indefinite  leave  to  remain  was
        granted on the  12  February  2002  following  periods  of  earlier
        temporary leave. On 28 February  2013  a  notice  of  liability  to
        deportation was issued and in May 2013 a decision to deport made on
        the  basis  that  Mr  Kabuga's   previous   convictions,   criminal
        associates and conduct make it conducive to the public good for him
        to be removed from the United Kingdom.
     3. Judge Herbert sets out Mr Kabuga's previous criminal activities  in
        the determination under challenge, at paragraphs 17  to  40,  which
        support the finding of Mr Kabuga being a  persistent  offender  and
        gang member. Key findings made by the Judge can  be  summarised  as
        follows


           i. The background material and  incidences  show  a  pattern  of
              conduct and lifestyle which puts Mr Kabuga in  the  immediate
              vicinity of quite serious criminal offences occurring usually
              involving gang violence. [143-146].
          ii. Mr Kabuga is a persistent offender which 'triggers' paragraph
              398 of the Immigration  Rules  [151].  Mr  Kabuga  has  eight
              convictions for ten separate offences, fifty  four  stop  and
              search incidences and twenty one separate matters  listed  on
              the CRIS computer record which  runs  to  some  four  hundred
              pages [152].
         iii. Mr Kabuga has only lived in the United Kingdom and  only  has
              tenuous ties to Uganda [153]. The only  ties  to  Uganda  are
              that his parents originate from  there  and  that  he  speaks
              English which is an official language of Uganda, although has
              no knowledge of even the most simple geography of  Uganda  or
              of its culture and customs [155]. Mr Kabuga, in terms of  his
              culture, customs and language is  a  product  of  the  United
              Kingdom and in particular of the  London  Borough  of  Newham
              whose upbringing has  been  influenced  by  the  gang-related
              culture of that borough [158].
          iv.  If  returned  to  Uganda   Mr   Kabuga   will   be   without
              accommodation, work or  the  socio-economic  and  educational
              norms which assist in integration [162].
           v. There has been a significant break in Mr  Kabuga's  offending
              behaviour from February 2013 save for the breach of  a  civil
              injunction in relation to not  associating  with  other  gang
              members for which he pleaded guilty in January 2015 [163].  A
              charge of affray was noted which was due to be heard  at  the
              Snaresbrook Crown Court in  July/August  2015   to  which  Mr
              Kabuga pleaded not guilty which was not relevant as it was  a
              matter still to be tried [164-165].
          vi. The effect of Mr Kabuga's removal  would  have  an  extremely
              detrimental effect upon his mother as she  has  already  lost
              two older children in Uganda which was  the  reason  for  her
              return journey, but also on his younger  brother  and  sister
              with whom he has an extremely strong bond and effectively  is
              the father figure in the household [166].   The  effect  upon
              his siblings and others would be significant and irreversible
              [169].
         vii. Mr Kabuga has  made  significant  progress  in  changing  his
              lifestyle,  criminal  behaviour  and  associates  [170].  The
              expert  in  working   with   young   people   in   delinquent
              circumstances has expressed confidence the  Mr  Kabuga  is  a
              significant way down the path to becoming a model citizen and
              able to make a significant contribution to society [172].


     4. At paragraph 197 the Judge posed the question whether or not  there
        would be very significant obstacles to Mr Kabuga's  integration  in
        Uganda. Having set out a number of findings the Judge concludes:


        213. I find as a matter of fact that the Appellant therefore  meets
        the exception as clearly defined under the Immigration Rules, under
        paragraph 399A, 398 and find that there would be  very  significant
        obstacles to his integration into Uganda.


        214. These obstacles are not trivial or slight or transient but  go
        to the heart of his existence as a human being. This is not just  a
        means of survival but of integration  which  must  be  a  realistic
        possibility and not just a means  of  existence.  Integration  into
        Uganda means exactly that.  It does not mean living on the  margins
        of society.  It  does  not  mean  living  close  to  starvation  or
        destitution.  Integration means that one should have  a  reasonable
        prospect of a normal life style of opportunities to engage in work,
        education and social interaction.


        215. There are significant obstacles to all of  these  factors  for
        obvious reasons that this Appellant was born and brought up in  the
        United Kingdom and has no more connection to Uganda that  the  vast
        majority of individuals in the United Kingdom.


        216. The fact he is of African appearance and speaks English is not
        sufficient  connection  and  means  that  there   are   significant
        obstacles to his integration into Uganda for the  detailed  reasons
        set out.


        217. I therefore find that the Appellant has discharged the  burden
        of proof of establishing on a balance of probabilities  that  there
        would be very significant obstacles to his integration into  Uganda
        where the Respondent proposes to deport him.


     5. The appeal was allowed by reference to EX.1 of the  Rules,  section
        177C of the 2002 Act, Article 8 ECHR and paragraph 399A. The  Judge
        finding 399A applies as  the  public  interest  in  deportation  is
        outweighed by the fact Mr Kabuga falls under the  exception  within
        paragraph 399A.
     6. Permission to appeal was granted on the 16 June 2015. On 4  January
        2016 the matter came before Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein who gave
        permission for further grounds of challenge to be filed. These were
        received on 27 January 2016 and Mr Kabuga's Rule 24 response on the
        10 February 2016 rebutting the challenge.




Discussion



     7. The only basis on which permission to appeal was  original  granted
        by First-tier Judge Osborne is that  in  relation  to  Mr  Kabuga's
        alleged destitution.  It was said to be  arguable  that  the  Judge
        failed to consider the facilitated returns scheme, details of which
        appeared in the reasons for deportation letter.  As  a  result  the
        Judge stated all issues raised in the grounds are arguable.
     8. The document headed 'Further grounds of  appeal'  relies  upon  the
        original grounds and additional grounds. Permission to rely on  the
        addition grounds is granted.
     9. It is not disputed that Mr Kabuga has a criminal record as found by
        the Judge or that his conduct and circumstances are as claimed.  As
        a persistent offender Mr Kabuga can be  deported  from  the  United
        Kingdom pursuant to paragraph 398 of the Immigration  Rules.  There
        is a need to consider if paragraph 399 or 399A applies for, if not,
        the public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by other
        factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
        above those described in paragraph 399 and 399A.
    10. 399A applies where 398(b) or (c) applies if:


        a) The person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of  his
           life; and
        b) He is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
        c) There would be very significant  obstacles  to  his  integration
           into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.


    11. There is need when assessing any  Article  8  element  to  consider
        section 117 A - C of the 2002 Act (as amended).
    12. The original grounds challenge specific findings of the Judge.  The
        additional grounds raise a number of procedural issues.
    13. The first of these is a challenge to the refusal by  the  Judge  to
        adjourn the hearing as requested by the Presenting Officer. This is
        referred to at paragraphs 12 to 14  of  the  determination  in  the
        following terms:


        12. The Respondent made an application that this matter  should  be
        adjourned in all for three months in order to allow further charges
        that had been laid against the appellant be determined.  They  also
        cited the necessity of ensuring that the case being put against the
        Appellant  was  at  its  highest  given  his  continued   offending
        behaviour.


        13. The application was opposed by the  appellant's  representative
        on the basis that this appeal had been outstanding since  May  2013
        and that there had been seven CMR hearings to date and the  further
        delay would simply have a further cost to the public purse  and  be
        disproportionate to the reasons put forward by the Respondent.


        14 I therefore refused the application for an adjournment.


    14. It is arguable the Judge may have fallen into legal  error  for  he
        makes no  mention  in  his  reasoning  of  the  correct  test  when
        considering  an  adjournment  application  which  is  that  of  the
        fairness of the decision. It is necessary to consider whether if an
        application is refused the parties  are  able  to  receive  a  fair
        hearing of the issues in dispute.
    15. What is not established is that any error that may have  been  made
        is material. It was not disputed that Mr Kabuga  had  come  to  the
        adverse attention of the  authorities  again  or  that  there  were
        pending proceedings. The deportation order was, however, issued  on
        the basis of Mr Kabuga's conduct prior to issue which was the  case
        before the Tribunal. Although the post hearing information referred
        to at paragraph 4 of the additional grounds refers to a sentence of
        four  months  having  been  imposed  for  the  breach  of  a  'gang
        injunction', the Secretary of State is  able  to  issue  a  further
        decision if  circumstances  warrant  the  same.  The  reference  to
        Farquharson [2013] UKUT 14 is also noted but the conduct complained
        of was the breach of an injunction of which the Judge was aware. No
        arguable prejudice to  the  Secretary  of  State  is  made  out  or
        evidence of a lack of a fair hearing established.
    16. The second procedural point arises by reference to paragraph  7  of
        the additional grounds of appeal in which it is stated:


        7. DC Callum Fraser's statement of 31 December 2015 is  clear  with
        respect to ongoing investigations with regard  to  appellants  post
        hearing criminal activities.  These include: "Bladed Article  -  19
        October 2015; Possession of Class B - 1 November 2015; Allowing  to
        be carried in stolen vehicle -  22  November  2015;  Conspiracy  to
        supply Class B - 27 November 2015"


    17. It cannot be an error for a judge to decide an appeal on the  basis
        of information not known to the judge that may not have existed  at
        the date of the hearing.
    18. In relation to the Judge's comment  that  Mr  Kabuga  has  no  more
        connection to Uganda than to any other sub-Saharan African  country
        [195], the claim this is inadequately reasoned has not  been  shown
        to amount to a material  error  of  law  per  se.  It  is  correct,
        however, that in Uner  v  The  Netherlands  -  46410/99  the  Grand
        Chamber affirmed at paragraph 55 of the judgment, after considering
        general principles in preceding paragraphs, that even those born in
        the host state can be expelled. That  theme  was  repeated  by  the
        Upper Tribunal in Bossade [2015] UKUT 415 in which it is  noted  at
        paragraph 5 of the determination that "He [the appellant] had never
        been outside the UK and did not speak Lingala or French. In the DRC
        he would have no friends, family, home or knowledge of the language
        or culture.  He was not  aware  he  had  uncles  in  the  DRC."  At
        paragraph 56 of the judgement the Tribunal find:


        56. Even if we had considered the claimant to meet the requirements
        of paragraph 399A(b), we would still have concluded he fails  under
        paragraph 399A because he fails to meet paragraph 399A(c)  and  (as
        explained  earlier)  to   succeed   under   paragraph   399A,   the
        requirements of both (b) and (c) (as well as (a)) must be  met  and
        we are not persuaded that there would be very significant obstacles
        to his integration into the country to which it is proposed  he  is
        deported.  We accept  there  would  be  significant  obstacles:  in
        particular he would have required to overcome the fact that he does
        not speak Lingala; that he has no experience of living  in  such  a
        country as an adult or indeed even  as  a  young  person  (only  an
        infant).  Whilst we do not accept  that  the  respondent  has  ever
        resiled from her position set out in her refusal decision that  the
        claimants has uncles in the DRC, for the purposes of this appeal we
        are also prepared to decide his case on the basis of his own  claim
        as set out in his witness statement that he has no uncles there.


        57. But the paragraph 399A(c) test is more  stringent:  it  is  not
        simply met by showing that a person has no close family ties in the
        country to which it is proposed he is deported; it  requires  "very
        significant obstacles to ... integration"  to  be  shown.   In  our
        judgment  the  obstacles  the  claimant  faces  do  not  meet  this
        demanding standard.  In relation to his command of language  spoken
        in the DRC, it was his own  mother's  evidence  that  he  had  been
        brought up in a household where French was spoken.  The  DRC  is  a
        Francophone country.  In any event, it was not suggested his behalf
        that there would be any  reasons  related  to  physical  or  mental
        incapacity preventing him  from  learning  the  local  language  or
        dialect.  As regards his lack of knowledge of the  culture,  whilst
        it was his evidence that he identified with British culture, it was
        not suggested he had specifically rejected or no longer  understood
        his cultural origins. Furthermore, as regards lack of family  ties,
        he is now a young adult and the  skills  he  has  acquired  through
        attending classes in prison will assist him in being able to earn a
        living without the need to be a dependant.  Further, we agree  with
        Mr Jarvis that it is reasonable to infer  that  his  mother  and/or
        other relatives here will seek to help him  financially,  at  least
        until he has time to find his own feet.  We  agree  with  Mr  Javis
        that it has not been shown that he would be prevented by reason  of
        any physical or  mental  instability  from  developing  social  and
        cultural ties in the DRC.  He is  young,  able  bodied  and  of  an
        adaptable age.


    19. Paragraph 396 of the Immigration Rules provides that where a person
        is liable to deportation the presumption shall be that  the  public
        interest requires  deportation.  Paragraph  398(c)  applies  as  Mr
        Kabuga  is  a  persistent  offender.  Paragraph   399(a)   has   no
        application as Mr Kabuga has no children. 399(b) was not  found  to
        apply which has not been challenged on appeal [180].
    20. Paragraph 339A applies  to  deportations  from  28  July  2014  and
        provides:


        This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -


         a) The person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of  his
            life; and
         b) He is socially and culturally integrated into the UK; and
         c) There would be very significant  obstacles  to  his  integration
            into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.


    21. It was not disputed before the Judge that Mr Kabuga  has  lived  in
        the UK for at least half his life immediately preceding the date of
        the immigration decision. As such the finding 399A(a) is  satisfied
        has not been shown to be infected by arguable legal error.
    22. It was not disputed before the Judge that  Mr  Kabuga  is  socially
        integrated into the UK and the finding by the Judge that 399A(b) is
        satisfied has not been shown  to  be  infected  by  arguable  legal
        error.
    23. The issues was,  as  identified  by  the  Judge,  399A(c)  and  the
        existence of very significate obstacles. It must be noted that  the
        language of the Rule is for there to be very significant  obstacles
        which is a higher threshold  than  just  obstacles  or  significant
        obstacles. Significant denotes something that is sufficiently great
        or important to be worthy  of  attention  or  something  having  or
        likely to have a major effect.
    24. In Secretary of State v JZ(Zambia) [2016] EWCA Civ 11 at  paragraph
        35 the Court of Appeal said:


        35. The correct approach for any decision-maker applying the  rules
        398 or 399A of the Immigration Rules is now well established.   The
        task is not to carry out a freestanding analysis of the  article  8
        factors.  The Secretary of  State  has  already  carried  out  that
        exercise in drafting the rules 398 to 399A.   Those  rules  form  a
        complete code explaining how article 8 must operate in cases  where
        a foreign criminal is resisting deportation.   The  decision  maker
        must take account of  the  proposed  deportee's  Convention  rights
        through the lens of the Immigration Rules. The rules emphasise  the
        high public interest in deporting foreign criminals.  In a case  to
        which rule 399 and 399A do not apply, very compelling reasons  will
        be required if they are to constitute  "exceptional  circumstances"
        which outweigh the public interest in deportation.   For  a  fuller
        exposition  of  these  now  well  established  principles.  See  MF
        (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  EWCA
        Civ 1192;  [2014]1  WLR  544,  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department v AJ  (Angola)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1636,  LC  (China)  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1310 and
        Secretary of State for the Home Department v Suckoo [2016] EWCA Civ
        38.

    25. It is not suggested the Judge referred to the wrong legal test. The
        issue is therefore whether  the  findings  of  the  Judge  and  the
        overall conclusion that they amounted to very significant obstacles
        was properly open on the available evidence.
    26. Paragraph 11 of the additional grounds suggest that in the decision
        letter of 2 May 2013 Mr Kabuga was advised that he is  entitled  to
        make an application under the facilitated returns scheme to benefit
        from the integration package that  is  available.  As  such  it  is
        implied that  the  Judges  finding  in  relation  to  the  lack  of
        resources  on  return  is  irrational.  This  suggestion  has  been
        countered by Ms Foot who submitted that the terms of the  Secretary
        of  States  policy  specifically  excludes  Mr  Kabuga  as  he  has
        contested his deportation by way of the appeal. The policy is  only
        available to those willing to return to  their  country  of  origin
        voluntarily.  Mr Tufan maintained  that  the  Secretary  of  States
        position is that a package remains available via the  International
        Office for Migration.  This will  provide  support  and  assistance
        with the integration process 'on the ground'.  Such support has not
        been shown to be inadequate but if no such support is available the
        position is considered below.
    27. In relation to  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration  into
        Uganda the Judge found that if returned to Uganda Mr Kabuga will be
        without accommodation, work or the socio-economic  and  educational
        norms which assist in integration [162].
    28. As stated above,  and  as  found  in  Bossade,  the  test  of  very
        significant obstacles is a demanding one. Mr Kabuga is said to only
        speak English but the primary national  and  official  language  of
        Uganda is English. No bar to effective communication  is  therefore
        made out if Mr Kabuga is returned, especially to  the  major  urban
        areas such as Kampala. At paragraph 22  of  the  determination  the
        Judge finds:


        200. Having taken into account the numerous  reports  and  evidence
        before me, I find that  whilst  English  is  one  of  the  official
        languages of Uganda from the country assessment and guidance it  is
        necessary to survive to converse  unless  one  has  an  independent
        source of income it is necessary for survival purposes to  be  able
        to speak one of the primary local languages namely Luganda in order
        to have any reasonable prospects of integration into society.


    29. The Judge fails to consider whether Mr Kabuga is able to  learn  an
        alternative language or to identify why only being  able  to  speak
        one of the three main languages will  result  in  very  significant
        obstacles.  The  test  is  not  that  of  reasonable  prospects  of
        integration. It is accepted that  the  ability  to  communicate  is
        important in enabling Mr Kabuga to integrate, but the evidence does
        not show that only being able to speak English initially will leave
        him isolated and unable to function.
    30. The statement Mr Kabuga has no more connection to Uganda  than  any
        other sub Saharan part of  Africa  is  arguable  incorrect  as  his
        mother is Ugandan. It may be tenuous as Mr Kabuga's mother came  to
        the UK when she was 21 and only returned on two occasions  to  look
        for her two children born in Uganda who are said to be missing.  It
        is not disputed that Mr Kabuga has never lived in Uganda  and  only
        visited the country when he was aged 11 and  14  to  accompany  his
        mother for a few weeks, but this  does  not  prevent  removal.  The
        wording of the Rules provide a balance in that if a person is  able
        to satisfy the requirements  they  may  remain  which  enables  the
        impact of a person having no  practical  experience  of  living  in
        another country to be considered.
    31. The finding at paragraph 204 that  as  Mr  Kabuga  has  no  family,
        friends, employment or accommodation in Uganda this means  he  will
        be effectively destitute is not made out. In MB, YT, GA  and  TK  v
        SSHD [2013] EWHC 123 it was held that  case  law  establishes  that
        Article 3 impose no general obligation on a  contracting  state  to
        refrain from removing a person to another  state  or  territory  in
        which he would be destitute. It was not the function of  Article  3
        to impose a minimum standard of social support for those in need. A
        breach of Article 3 only occurred when deliberate state action  was
        taken to prohibit a person from sustaining himself by work and when
        accommodation and the barest of necessities were removed.
    32. The Judge fails to consider what support may be available  such  as
        from Mr Kabuga's mother who works  in  the  UK,  according  to  her
        witness statement, and who speaks of the close bond she has with Mr
        Kabuga. The average month's disposable income in Uganda is  in  the
        region  of  556,250.00   Ugandan   Shillings   which   equates   to
        approximately �116.00. The cost of renting a one bedroom  apartment
        in the city is in the region of �120 per month.  It  has  not  been
        shown there are no NGO who are unwilling or  unable  to  assist  in
        integration as a number of such groups exist in  Uganda,  including
        the church.
    33. The legal error in the determination is the Judge  recording  those
        elements that will make integration into Uganda difficult and  even
        initially hard for Mr Kabuga and to add to that a number  of  other
        elements [208-212] which are claimed  on  balance  to  satisfy  the
        required test, when this not the case. The test is not difficulties
        or problems but very significant obstacles. It has not  been  shown
        those the Judge considered cannot be overcome. Even if  significant
        obstacles this is not enough when  the  higher  threshold  of  very
        significant obstacles are required. Whilst initially  it  may  have
        appeared that the  Judge  had  just  done  enough  to  support  the
        decision, on a more detailed  consideration  of  the  evidence  and
        reflection, I find the Secretary of State has made out her case  in
        relation to the making of legal error material to the  decision  to
        allow the appeal.
    34. The determination is set aside with the findings in relation to  Mr
        Kabuga's gang related activities, personal presentation, and family
        circumstances being preserved. No  rule  15(2)(a)  application  has
        been made, enabling me to  remake  the  decision  on  the  evidence
        available.
    35. As Mr Kabuga has failed to show he is able  to  satisfy  paragraphs
        399 or 399A in full, with specify reference to 399A(c) he  is  only
        able to succeed if he is able to show, pursuant to  paragraph  398,
        that the public interest in  deportation  is  outweighed  by  other
        factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
        above those described in paragraph 399 and 399A.   This  imposes  a
        very high threshold upon Mr Kabuga and even  when  considering  all
        the facts he seeks to rely upon in support of his  being  permitted
        to remain in the United Kingdom, I find he  failed  to  demonstrate
        such very compelling circumstance. In  arriving  at  this  decision
        consideration has been given to section 117B and C of the 2002 Act.
        It is accepted Mr Kabuga is  integrated  into  the  UK  and  speaks
        English. He is not financially independent but hopes to be able  to
        be so in the future, He is not a parent.
    36. As regards 117C(1) and (2) Mr Kabuga has been found to have been  a
        member of a gang in  in  UK  and  a  persistent  offender.  He  has
        recently been sentenced for a breach of a gang  related  injunction
        forbidding his contact with other members of the gang.  In 2011  Mr
        Kabuga was sentenced to an eighteen month  detention  and  training
        order when aged 16 for offences  of  a  violent  nature  which  the
        sentencing judge found were gang related. There  is  a  substantial
        deterrent element in relation to the deportation of those  involved
        in gang related crimes which  plague  cities  in  the  UK  such  as
        London. Operation Nexus has been set up solely to  deal  with  such
        offenders and has been designed and delivered by  the  Metropolitan
        Police and UKBA and aims to maximise intelligence, information, and
        worldwide links to improve how the UK deals with  and  responds  to
        foreign nationals breaking the law.  The documents provided by  the
        Operation Nexus team are those referred  to  by  Judge  Herbert  in
        paragraph 10 of his decision  of  some  500  pages.  These  contain
        references to serious matters  giving  rise  to  a  greater  public
        interest in deportation.
    37. Mr Kabuga does not have a qualifying partner or child so as to fall
        within  section  117(C)(5)  (Exception  2).  Exception  1  is   not
        available for the reason Mr Kabuga is unable to satisfy 399A(b) and
        (c). The situation of his mother and siblings has  been  considered
        and the reports provided in relation thereto  taken  into  account.
        It is accepted the family will have to adapt following  deportation
        but it  has  not  been  shown  this  will  result  in  a  situation
        sufficient to make the decision disproportionate. The chronology of
        the offending history has also been factored into the decision.
    38. I find Mr Kabuga cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules both in
        relation to the first and second stages of the Article  8  analysis
        as identified in Bossade.


Decision

    39. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    40. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the     Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
        Rules 2005. I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the
        Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
