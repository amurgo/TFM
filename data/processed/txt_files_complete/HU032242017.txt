For the Respondent:    Mr Wu


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Anthony made following a hearing at Birmingham on 22nd February 2018.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of China born on 3rd March 1949.  She applied
    for entry clearance on 15th December 2016 to settle in  the  UK  as  an
    adult dependent relative of her daughter.  The application was  refused
    on 26th January 2017 and it was this refusal which was the  subject  of
    the appeal before the Immigration Judge.

 3. There are no credibility  issues  in  this  appeal.   The  sponsor  was
    accepted by the judge to have given wholly credible evidence and  there
    is no challenge to this aspect of the appeal by the Secretary of State.



 4. The  claimant  suffers  from  cerebral  infarction,  early  Alzheimer's
    disease and hypertension.  Her daughter, the sponsor, came to the UK in
    2000 when her mother was in good health.  However the claimant now  not
    only has the classic symptoms  of  early  onset  Alzheimer's  but  also
    suffers from low mood  and  depression.   She  struggles  to  care  for
    herself.  The judge accepted that she is unable to buy and prepare food
    safely without assistance and requires help to safely perform  everyday
    tasks.  He was satisfied that she met the requirements of paragraph  E-
    ECDR.2.4.

 5. The judge then  considered whether the claimant could obtain  the  care
    which she needs in China with the practical and financial help  of  the
    sponsor.  He wrote as follows:

         "Whilst the appellant does assert that family members can no longer
         look after her and that they are doing this on  a  temporary  basis
         she does not argue that such care is not  available  in  China  and
         that there is  no  person  who  can  reasonably  provide  it.   The
         sponsor's evidence is that such care is available in  the  form  of
         government and privately managed residential care homes and live-in
         carers.  However her evidence is that such care is not  affordable.
         The sponsor's evidence is that care costs for a government  managed
         residential care home is between two and three times the amount the
         appellant receives from  her  monthly  pension.   This  equates  to
         approximately ï¿½600 a month.   Although  it  is  accepted  that  the
         financial requirements are met in this case the sponsor's  evidence
         is that she cannot afford to remit such funds to her  mother.   The
         appellant has not provided any background material  to  demonstrate
         the affordability of purchasing care  in  either  a  government  or
         privately  managed  residential  care  home  or  alternatively   to
         purchase care from an individual paid carer.  Whilst I  have  found
         the appellant and sponsor to be a truthful witness in  relation  to
         her mother's symptoms and ability to care for herself I find that I
         cannot accept her assertion as to the cost  of  such  care  in  the
         absence of any documentary evidence.  I find that  it  is  entirely
         reasonable for the appellant through her representations to provide
         such evidence especially as it is the sponsor's evidence that  they
         have looked into this.  For reasons unexplained these have not been
         provided to the respondent  or  the  Tribunal.   I  find  that  the
         appellant has failed to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  to  the
         balance of probabilities that such care is not affordable in China.
          The appellant cannot satisfy the requirements of E-ECDR.2.5."

 6. The judge then turned to Article 8.  He accepted that there was  family
    life between the claimant and the sponsor.  He said  that  the  support
    which the claimant currently requires is being provided  by  her  niece
    and that the sponsor's evidence was that her  cousin  could  no  longer
    care for her because she has recently undergone  a  kidney  transplant.
    However there was no  medical  evidence  to  confirm  that  the  kidney
    transplant had impacted on the niece's ability  to  continue  to  care.
    Neither was there any letter from her to confirm that she could not  do
    so.

 7. Nevertheless the judge concluded as follows:

         "I regard the  following  factors  as  significant:  the  sponsor's
         length of residence in the UK; her economic contribution to the UK;
         the fact that the financial requirements have been met in this case
         and the fact that the  appellant  is  financially  and  emotionally
         dependent on  the  sponsor.   I  find  that  the  presence  of  the
         appellant will not be damaging to the UK's economy.  I accept  that
         the appellant is distressed at her  separation  from  the  sponsor.
         Due to her advancing age, low  mood  and  Alzheimer's  she  is  now
         dependent on the sponsor emotionally.   I  find  that  contact  via
         modern means  of  communication  would  be  a  wholly  insufficient
         substitute for family life to be enjoyed between the appellant  and
         the sponsor.  Given  the  evidence  which  I  have  considered  and
         discussed above I find the evidence establishes that family life is
         infringed  and  continues  to  be  infringed   by   the   continued
         separation.  I find that this is a truly compelling  case  for  the
         grant of entry clearance."

 8. On that basis he allowed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

 9. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had used Article 8 as a general dispensing power in order  to
    allow the appeal contrary to Patel and Others v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72.  Outside of the factors  under  the
    Rules the judge does not establish  any  basis  on  which  the  current
    status quo of the family life between the claimant and sponsor would be
    disrupted by refusing entry clearance.  Family life could  continue  as
    in the past.

10. Second, the judge had failed to factor in the significant weight  which
    should be given to  the  public  interest  and  the  inability  of  the
    claimant to show that she meets the requirements  of  the  Rules.   The
    judge sought to minimise this by finding that the sponsor's  length  of
    residence and contribution to the UK meant that she could not leave the
    UK but these matters carry limited or no  weight  since  there  was  no
    removal decision against the sponsor.  If she chose  to  leave  the  UK
    that was a matter for her and it  does  not  entitle  the  claimant  to
    succeed outside the Rules in order to obtain a more favourable outcome.



11. Whilst the decline of the claimant is unfortunate and saddening,  given
    that there is provision of care in China and contact can be  maintained
    in the same manner as it did immediately prior to the  application  the
    judge failed to give adequate reasons to show how the Article 8 balance
    could  realistically  outweigh  the  strong  public  interest   firstly
    demonstrated under the Rules and then within the framework  of  Section
    117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge Woodcraft on  18th
    June 2018 for the reasons stated in the grounds.

13. The claimant served a Rule 24 response arguing that the grounds were  a
    simple disagreement with the sustainable conclusions of the  judge  and
    an attempt to reargue the appeal.  There was an obligation  to  promote
    family life rather than to maintain the status  quo.   It  was  evident
    that the judge had considered the relevant public interest factors  and
    the weight which he gave to them were a matter for  him.  The  decision
    was  neither irrational nor perverse.

Submissions

14. Mr Tarlow relied on his grounds.   He  confirmed  that  there  were  no
    credibility issues  in  this  appeal  and  whilst  it  was  not  always
    impermissible to allow an appeal on Article 8 grounds where  the  Rules
    had not been met, in this particular case it was not open to the  judge
    to  reach  the  conclusion  which  he  did,  since  the  evidence   was
    insufficient for an outcome in the claimant's favour.

15. Mr Wu, who is the sponsors husband, confirmed that his wife  wanted  to
    be reunited with her mother in the UK.  She was now  in  China  looking
    after her mother who  did  not  have  many  years  left  to  her.   Her
    retirement wages were low and care homes were expensive.

Findings and Conclusions

16. The judge accepted that  the  claimant's  medical  conditions  were  as
    presented.  That is that she suffers from poor memory and low mood.  He
    also accepted that she needed help to safely  perform  everyday  tasks.
    Crucially however, he did not accept that it would not be possible  for
    the help which the claimant needs could not be obtained in  China.   He
    was not satisfied that there was evidence to show that  she  could  not
    afford privately managed residential care homes  or  a  live-in  carer.
    Moreover there was no evidence  that  the  claimant's  niece  could  no
    longer care for her, either from the niece herself or from elsewhere.

17. Having found that the claimant could not meet the requirements  of  the
    Rules it was incumbent on the  judge  to  identify  compelling  factors
    which required a grant of entry clearance outside them.  In this  case,
    because there was a reasonable alternative open to the claimant,  there
    are no such compelling factors.  Family life  has  continued  for  many
    years through visits, both the sponsor visiting China and the  claimant
    visiting the UK.  The sponsor   can  also  choose  whether  she  spends
    longer time with her mother or whether  she  arranges  for  alternative
    care to be provided for her in China.

18. It was therefore not open to the judge to allow the appeal on Article 8
    grounds.  He erred in  doing  so  by  using  Article  8  as  a  general
    dispensing power which is unlawful.

Notice of Decision

The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside.  It  is  remade
as follows.  The claimant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
