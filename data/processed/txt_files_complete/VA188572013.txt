Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery of the Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent:    None


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

   1. The Respondent to whom I shall refer as "the Applicant" is  a  citizen
      of Algeria born on 23 July 1982.  She is married to Maamar Taib who is
      a British citizen of Algerian descent, born on 26 August 1966.  By his
      previous marriage he has five children.  On 5 April 2010 in Algeria he
      married the Applicant.  They have a son born on 1 June 2014.

   2. The Applicant states she continues to  live  in  Algeria  because  she
      cares for her aged parents and her husband  who  is  her  Sponsor  has
      visited her on a number of occasions.

   3. She previously applied for entry clearance  as  a  visitor  which  was
      refused by the Appellant (the ECO) on 1 February 2013.   She  did  not
      appeal the February decision to refuse her  entry  clearance  but  re-
      applied on 19 September 2013. Her second application was refused on 10
      October and on 4 November 2013 through her husband she  lodged  notice
      of appeal under Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
      Act 2002 as amended (the 2002 Act).

   4. The ECO refused her entry clearance as a visitor because  he  did  not
      consider the Applicant would be a genuine visitor intending to  return
      to Algeria at the end of her proposed visit as required by  paragraphs
      41(i) and (ii) of the Immigration Rules.

   5. The grounds of appeal are contained  in  a  statement  signed  by  the
      Applicant on 31 October 2013.  They refer  to  her  marriage  and  the
      application leading to the decision under  appeal.   Mention  is  made
      that she cares for her elderly parents with whom she lives in  Algeria
      and that her husband sends her about ï¿½80 each  month.   The  Applicant
      asserts she had never thought of living outside  Algeria  and  leaving
      her parents and friends and  family.   Her  husband  lived  in  London
      because of his commitments which included work and his children by his
      previous marriage.  The grounds assert the Applicant has  a  right  to
      visit her husband in the United Kingdom at any time.

Change in the Law

   6. On 25 June 2013 Section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 came  into
      force effectively restricting the grounds of appeal against refusal of
      entry clearance for a family visit to human rights grounds only.

The First-tier Tribunal's Determination

   7. By a determination promulgated on 29 September 2014 Judge of the First-
      tier Tribunal Canavan allowed the Applicant's appeal on  human  rights
      grounds.  She noted that  shortly  after  the  Applicant  married  the
      Sponsor's brother and two sons had died in a road traffic accident and
      the brother's daughter had been badly injured.  By 2013 the  Sponsor's
      family situation in Algeria had settled and he decided it was time for
      his wife, the Applicant to visit him in the United Kingdom.  The Judge
      was satisfied the husband had provided a reasonable explanation why he
      and his wife continued to live in separate countries and that he would
      like her to spend some time in the United Kingdom with him before they
      took any decisions about their future married  life.   She  considered
      there were no "pressing  public  interest  considerations  to  justify
      refusing to grant entry clearance on  the  facts  of  this  particular
      case".

   8. The ECO sought permission to appeal.  The grounds of  the  application
      for permission to appeal assert the Judge erred in her approach to the
      Article 8 assessment.

   9. The grounds refer to the judgment in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013]  EWCA
      Civ 1192, R (OAO Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  and  the
      determination in Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules  -  correct  approach)
      Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).  They go on to state  the  refusal  of
      entry clearance to the Applicant did not prevent her and  her  husband
      continuing their family life as before and mentioned Patel and  Others
      v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 where at paragraph 57 the  Supreme  Court  noted
      that Article 8 is not a general dispensing power.

  10. On 14 November 2014 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal TRP  Hollingworth
      granted permission to  appeal  on  the  basis  it  was  arguable  that
      inadequate reasons had been given by the Judge to justify allowing the
      appeal and  insufficient  weight  had  been  given  to  the  fact  the
      Applicant and her husband lived apart out of choice.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

  11. The Sponsor attended the  hearing  but  otherwise  the  Applicant  was
      unrepresented.  I explained in simple terms the purpose and  procedure
      adopted in error of  law  hearings  and  the  criteria  applicable  to
      ascertain whether the First-tier Tribunal's determination contained an
      error of law.

  12. I referred Mr Avery to the recent  judgment  in  R  (oao  Oludoyi  and
      Others) v SSHD (Article 8 - MM Lebanon) and Nagre  (IJR)  [2014]  UKUT
      00539 (IAC) and put it to him that in the light of this  judgment  and
      what had been said about Nagre in R (oao MM and Others) v SSHD  [2014]
      EWCA Civ 985 I was likely to find an error of law based on the matters
      referred to in paragraphs 3-5 of the grounds for appeal.

  13. Mr Avery submitted that in most cases refusal of entry clearance for a
      family visit could not engage the State's obligations under Article  8
      of the European Convention to respect  the  right  to  a  private  and
      family life.  Further, if the Applicant and  her  husband  could  live
      outside the United Kingdom then any  claim  based  on  Article  8  was
      fatally undermined.  He relied on the finding in Patel and Others that
      Article 8 is not a  general  dispensing  power.   He  referred  me  to
      paragraph 12 of the Judge's determination where she had  recorded  the
      Sponsor had said that since his parents had died he had fewer  members
      of his family in Algeria and so he would prefer not to have the  visit
      quite so often.  He had grown up in the United Kingdom and would  like
      to spend some time with the Applicant in the United Kingdom as well as
      in Algeria.  The ECO's decision did not amount to an interference with
      the private and family life of the Applicant or of her husband because
      they could continue to see each other in the same manner as  they  had
      been doing since their marriage.

  14. I attempted a brief summary of the points  in  non-technical  language
      for the benefit of the  Sponsor.   Mr  Avery  agreed  it  was  a  fair
      summary.  I asked the Sponsor if he had any comments.  He told  me  he
      had been married for some four years but his wife  had  never  visited
      the United Kingdom and he did not want to go to Algeria to visit  her.
      He insisted he had a right that his wife should be able to  visit  him
      in the United Kingdom.  She would definitely return.   He  also  added
      that they now had a son born on 1 June 2014.

  15.  I  enquired  of  the  Sponsor  why  it  appeared  from  the   Judge's
      determination that the birth of this child  had  not  been  mentioned.
      Indeed, there was no other reference to the child in the documents  in
      the Tribunal file.  The Sponsor replied he did not  inform  the  Judge
      because he was not  questioned  on  the  point.   He  added  that  the
      Applicant could not apply for entry clearance as  his  spouse  because
      she could not meet certain conditions  although  he  did  not  specify
      which conditions.  Mr Avery had no further submissions.

Error of Law Consideration

  16. The Judge's treatment of the claim under Article 8 which was the  sole
      issue in the appeal came after a lengthy consideration  of  the  facts
      and references to how a Judge should approach a claim under Article  8
      and the substantive jurisprudence.  However, the Judge's assessment of
      the claim under Article 8 was  dealt  with  comparatively  briefly  at
      paragraph 22 of her determination.  There was no reference to  any  of
      the legitimate objectives listed in Article  8(2)  against  which  the
      assessment of the proportionality of the  ECO's  decision  had  to  be
      made.  More  importantly,  there  was  no  proper  balancing  exercise
      carried out and there was no reference to the factors referred  to  in
      Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  A lack of a reference to  Section  117B
      shows that the Judge did not take sufficient account of the ECO's view
      of how Article 8 should be interpreted and applied.

  17. The parties agreed that having found an error of law I should  proceed
      to dispose of the substantive appeal.

Findings and Substantive Consideration

  18. Mr Avery submitted that  the  Applicant's  circumstances,  absent  any
      other evidence and there was none, were  insufficient  to  engage  the
      State's obligations under Article 8.  The decision did not  constitute
      any real interference  with  the  private  and  family  lives  of  the
      Applicant and her husband because their private and family lives could
      continue in the same manner as before.

  19. The Sponsor referred to his children by his first marriage.  They were
      British citizens, they had never been  to  Algeria  and  their  mother
      would not agree to him taking them for a visit to Algeria.  They had a
      right to have their recently born brother visit them.

  20. I explained to the Sponsor that because this was  an  out  of  country
      appeal I was only able to consider evidence relating to matters at  or
      before the date of the decision under appeal,  10  October  2013.   He
      responded that he needed to remain in the United Kingdom to  work  and
      he wanted his wife and youngest son to visit him.   I  explained  that
      because of Section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act of 2013  the  appeal
      could only be considered on human rights grounds.  This was  different
      from an appeal under the Immigration Rules.  Under the  Rules  if  the
      Applicant satisfied the requirements of the Rules  then  there  was  a
      presumptive right to be granted leave to enter or remain. This was not
      so in appeals based on human  rights  claims  where  it  was  for  the
      Applicant to show that a refusal of leave to enter or remain  amounted
      to an interference with the private and family life of  the  Applicant
      and her family and for the  Tribunal  to  find  such  interference  so
      serious that the refusal was disproportionate to the need to  maintain
      proper immigration control or any other lawful objective.

  21. I understand both the Applicant and her husband have good reasons  for
      wanting her to visit the United Kingdom and that it is  the  husband's
      preference that she visit him rather than he visit  her,  particularly
      if he is to introduce his recently born son to his half-siblings.

  22. I adopt the approach to appeals on grounds of Article 8 as  summarised
      in paragraphs 7-12 of EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41.  Each of  the
      Applicant and her husband has a  in  effect  a  separate  private  and
      family life, she in Algeria and he in the  United  Kingdom.   For  the
      past four years they have pursued their marital family life  by  means
      of visits by the husband to the Applicant in Algeria. The decision  to
      refuse the Applicant entry  clearance  is  an  interference  with  her
      private and family life and indeed that of her  son  as  well  as  her
      husband.  As the husband put it, he would  now  prefer  the  Applicant
      visit him rather than he  visit  her.  Of  course,  I  understand  the
      husband would like to introduce his older children to their new  half-
      brother. There was no mention of introducing his new wife to  them  or
      evidence beyond assertion that the mother of the older children  would
      not allow the husband to take them to Algeria.

  23. Neither the Applicant nor her husband has given any  other  reason  to
      support the claim. Neither of them have any inherent right to  require
      the state to respect their wishes as to how  they  choose  to  conduct
      their marital life insofar as it engages the state's right to  control
      immigration, as provided for in the case of the United Kingdom by  the
      Immigration Rules.

  24. I remind  myself  that  the  interference  is  merely  preventing  the
      Applicant visiting her husband in the United Kingdom and nothing more.
       I do not find that any duty which might be imputed to  the  State  to
      foster family life is so extensive as to enable a visit  of  the  type
      contemplated by the Applicant and her husband.  These circumstances do
      not establish on the balance of  probabilities  that  the  refusal  of
      entry clearance is a sufficiently serious interference to  engage  the
      United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  Article  8  of   the   European
      Convention. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed.

Anonymity

  25. There was no request for an  anonymity  direction  or  order.   Having
      heard the appeal, I find none is warranted.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
is set aside.  The following decision is substituted:-

    The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds (Article 8).
