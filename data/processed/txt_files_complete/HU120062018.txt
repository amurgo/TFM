For the Appellant:     Mr R. Ahmed (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety (Senior HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Bircher, promulgated on 19th March 2019, following a  hearing  at
    North Shields on 12th February 2019.  In the determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, and  was  born  on  6th
    March 1993.  He appeals against the decision of the  Respondent,  Entry
    Clearance Officer, dated 30th April 2019, refusing his application  for
    leave to enter the United Kingdom, as the spouse of  a  person  present
    and settled in the United Kingdom, namely, his wife, Ms [SA].

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim  is  that  he  has  satisfied  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM because his sponsoring wife earns
    an annual salary of �20,119.13.  She held two jobs.  She works with the
    Coop, and has done so since 12th December 2009,  and  she  also  has  a
    second job with Heat Restaurant, which job she began on 12th June 2017.
      Therefore, the refusal on the basis of financial requirements is  not
    justified.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge set out the Immigration Rules  (see  pages  2  to  5  of  the
    determination), before applying the burden and  standard  of  proof  in
    this case (see page 5).  The judge had regard to the leading  cases  in
    this context (see pages 6 to 8).  The judge then went on  to  give  her
    reasons for refusal of the decision.  She observed that there had  been
    in this case  "undercover  often  undated  letter  received  at  Arnhem
    Support Centre  on  13th  November  2018  from  the  Appellant's  legal
    representatives (Arkwright Law), further electronic bank statements and
    letters from the Sponsor's two employers ...".  The judge  went  on  to
    say that, "however, despite the ECO setting out the reasons for refusal
    letter the requirements of Appendix FM-SE, the electronic documents are
    of little evidential value.  This is because they do  not  satisfy  the
    criteria as set out [in the Rules]".  The judge explained that what was
    meant by this was that:

         "If electronic bank statements are to  be  provided  they  must  be
         accompanied by a letter from the  bank  on  its  headed  stationery
         confirming that the electronic bank  statements  are  authentic  or
         each page of the electronic bank statements submitted must bear the
         official stamp of the issuing bank on every page" (paragraph 16, at
         page 9 of the determination).

 5. Having so concluded, the judge then proceeded to have regard to Article
    8 considerations, and refused the appeal on this basis  as  well.   The
    conclusion  was  that  it  would  not,   in   the   circumstances,   be
    disproportionate to refuse the Appellant's appeal.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application take issue with what the  judge  had  stated
    above (at paragraph 16 of the determination).  They go on to say  that,
    "it  is  submitted  that  despite  the  Appellant  not  providing   the
    electronic bank statements in the correct format before the FTT hearing
    the Judge of the FTT fails to make any express findings as  to  whether
    the Appellant's spouse is employed and earning to  meet  the  financial
    requirement  (this  is  despite  not  providing  the  electronic   bank
    statements in the correct format).  In this case the evidence  was  not
    rejected as false, showed that the Appellant's spouse met the financial
    requirements at the date of making the application  and  also  met  the
    financial requirement of the date of hearing ... (see  paragraph  9  of
    the grounds).

 7. On 4th June 2019 permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 8th August 2019, Mr Rashid Ahmed, appearing
    as Counsel on behalf of the  Appellant,  relied  upon  his  grounds  of
    application.  He stated that the judge had  before  the  Tribunal  bank
    statements showing the net payment for each employment and this  amount
    was in  excess  of  the  required  �18,600,  amounting  to  �20,119.13.
    Second, reliance was placed upon paragraph 9 of  the  grounds,  namely,
    that the judge had not rejected as false the  earnings  that  had  been
    claimed, and this being so, the appeal  ought  to  have  been  allowed.
    Third, the appeal should have been allowed on human rights  grounds  in
    any event, if the Rules had not been satisfied only for reasons of non-
    compliance with the electronic bank statements being not in the correct
    format.

 9. However, Mr Ahmed also appeared to suggest  initially  that  there  had
    indeed been a letter from the bank in exactly the  manner  required  by
    the judge.  It was stated that there was a letter from the NatWest Bank
    which did accompany the electronic statements.  Therefore,  the  appeal
    was wrongly dismissed in any event.  At this stage, Mr McVeety spoke up
    and said that the only issue he had with this letter from  the  NatWest
    Bank was that it was dated 27th March 2019, whereas the hearing  before
    the judge had been on 12th February  2019,  thus  being  over  a  month
    later.  Mr Ahmed asked for a short adjournment to  discuss  the  matter
    with the sponsoring wife, and to consult  with  his  solicitor  on  the
    phone.  When he returned, he accepted that the position indeed was,  as
    Mr McVeety had just clarified, namely, that the letter  from  the  bank
    was now dated 27th March 2019, with the view to gaining permission from
    the Tribunal to appeal, but it had not been before Judge  Bircher  when
    the decision of the Tribunal below had been made.

10. The concession by Mr Rashid in this respect, forced him to fall back on
    other arguments in his grounds of application.  He now relied upon  the
    Upper Tribunal's presidential panel in MM (unfairness;  E  &  R)  Sudan
    [2014] UKUT 105, where the Tribunal had said that a  successful  appeal
    is not dependent on the demonstration of some failing on  the  part  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  This is because "an error of law may be found
    to have occurred in circumstances where some material evidence, through
    no fault of the FTT, was not considered with resulting unfairness".   I
    noted,  however,  that  the  difficulty  with  the  submission  is  the
    reference in what the Upper Tribunal describes as "material"  evidence.
    If the evidence of the letter from the National  Westminster  Bank,  of
    27th March 2019 was not actually before  Judge  Bircher's  Tribunal  of
    12th February 2019 then it could not be evidence that was "material" to
    her decision making.  It was evidence that arose after her decision had
    been made.  The judge could not be blamed for not taking  into  account
    something that she had been unable to take into account.

11. For his part, Mr McVeety submitted that the appeal would fail  for  two
    reasons.  First, the letter of 27th March 2019 postdated the making  of
    the decision by the judge, and  the  hearing  of  the  appeal  on  12th
    February 2019.  Second, insofar as it is being alleged that  the  judge
    ought to have allowed the appeal because there is  no  finding  by  the
    judge as to the falsity of the electronic  bank  statements,  this  was
    untenable because  the  judge  had  quite  simply  concluded  that  the
    Appellant could not succeed  because  he  could  not  comply  with  the
    Immigration Rules.  The failure to comply meant that the appeal fell to
    be refused, unless it could be argued  that  the  appeal  ought  to  be
    allowed on human rights grounds.  Third, the  judge  did  consider  the
    human rights arguments, with copious reference to  the  case  law,  and
    concluded in the end that the appeal could not succeed  on  this  basis
    either.

No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.

13. First, the Appellant in this case did  not  succeed  for  two  reasons.
    There was no letter from the bank "on its headed stationery  confirming
    that the electronic  bank  statements  are  authentic",  as  the  judge
    explained (at paragraph 16).  Such letter as there was, was dated  27th
    March 2019, but by that time, the decision had been promulgated on 19th
    March 2019.  The judge cannot be faulted for being in error for that.

14. Second, and in any event, even in the absence of an accompanying letter
    from the bank, the appeal could have been allowed if it  was  the  case
    that "each page of the electronic bank statement submitted ... bear the
    official stamp of the issuing bank on every page" (paragraph 16).  This
    also was not the case.  Indeed, the letter from the bank of 27th  March
    2019 actually makes it clear, in bold handwritten capital letters that,
    "when  producing  copy  statements,  not  standard  practice  for  each
    individual page to be stamped and dated".  This statement is signed  by
    Michael J Walker.  He describes himself as the personal banker  of  the
    sponsoring wife.  If Michael J Walker was  unable  to  date  and  stamp
    every single page, then the letter had to be submitted before the  date
    of the decision appealed against, and this was not the case.

15. Third, Mr Ahmed's submissions  that  the  appeal  ought  to  have  been
    allowed even if there was no error on the part of  the  judge,  on  the
    basis of what the Tribunal stated in MM [2014] UKUT  105,  "where  some
    material evidence", through no fault of the  FTT,  was  not  considered
    with  resulting  unfairness",  is   distinctly  unpersuasive.  This  is
    because the material  evidence  was  not  actually  placed  before  the
    Tribunal  on  the  relevant  date  and  had  not  been  sent   in   for
    consideration for the appeal.  Finally,  there  is  no  prospect  of  a
    successful Article 8 challenge, for the reasons that the judge has  set
    out in the remaining part of the determination.  The decision cannot be
    disproportionate or unjustified, because it  is  open,  as  Mr  McVeety
    submitted before me, for the Appellant to apply again with  the  proper
    letters of authentication from the bank, as any other  applicant  would
    do, with a view to complying with the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not amount to an  error  of
    law.  The decision shall stand.

17. No anonymity direction is made.

18. The appeal is dismissed.
