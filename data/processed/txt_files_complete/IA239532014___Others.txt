Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Fijinala, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr E Anyeng, Counsel instructed by Calices
Solicitors
                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal brought by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department in respect of a determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge M
    R Oliver which was promulgated on 19 March 2015.  The determination  is
    extremely brief and runs merely to seven paragraphs.  The determination
    records that the respondents are a 50 year old father and his  40  year
    old wife together with four children.  They are all Nigerian  nationals
    and they arrived in the United Kingdom in June 2009 with leave as  Tier
    1 (General) Migrants.  That leave was extended until 12 March 2014.

2.   On 10 March 2014 the lead applicant applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain but subsequently withdrew his application.  He applied again  on
    9 April 2014.  That application was refused, the decision being made on
    15 May 2014.  The reason for the application being refused was that the
    applicant claimed that his previous earnings as a self-employed  person
    were �45,393 when in reality the profits were  �8,918.   The  applicant
    gave notice of appeal on 30 May 2014 and argued before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge that an error had  been  made  by  his  accountants.   A
    receipt was submitted showing that the appellant had paid income tax in
    the sum of �7,806.78 on 23 January 2015.  This  additional  information
    post-dates the decision on behalf of the Home Secretary made on 15 May.
     Indeed it was sent under cover of a solicitor's letter  dated  16  May
    2014, the day immediately after the decision.

3.   The determination is not merely brief, it is  also  somewhat  confused.
    In paragraph 6 the First-tier Tribunal Judge states,

         "there has clearly been an  innocent  error  on  the  part  of  the
         accountants.  Had the drawings been properly counted as income  the
         appellant would comfortably  have  satisfied  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM".

    It was accepted today by the applicants' legal representative that this
    reference to Appendix FM is wholly erroneous because the  case  had  at
    all times proceeded under separate appendices dealing with points-based
    claims.  Not only that but the discussion under Article 8 is  extremely
    cursory and consists of one sentence in paragraph  3  and  the  summary
    sentence in paragraph 7.

4.   The argument to justify the brevity of the discussion of Article  8  is
    that  the  matter  had  been  dealt  with  by   means   of   additional
    documentation put before the Tribunal.  The difficulty  arises  because
    it is contended that this documentation was  not  admissible.   Section
    85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  states  under
    sub-paragraph (2),

         "in  relation  to  an  appeal  under  Section  82(1)   against   an
         immigration decision of a kind specified in Section 82(2)(b) or (c)
         the Tribunal may consider only the  circumstances  appertaining  at
         the time of the decision"

    Here the circumstances appertaining at the time of the  decision  quite
    clearly meant that there would have been a nil  score  in  relation  to
    earnings and therefore no entitlement.

5.   It is argued before me today that that evidence  that  the  accountants
    made a mistake should properly have been before the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge.  It is said that no objection was taken to the admission of this
    corrective evidence.  Whatever stance may have been adopted by the Home
    Office on the earlier occasion, section 85A is very clear in its terms.
     The Tribunal may consider only the circumstances appertaining  at  the
    time of the decision and even if the Home Office were willing to  waive
    that provision and concur in the admission of other evidence, there  is
    no power in the Tribunal to give consideration to it.

6.   Subsection (iv) of section 85A does provide certain exceptions to  this
    general rule. The applicant's representative  relies  on  sub-paragraph
    (c) which refers to evidence which "is adduced to prove that a document
    is genuine or valid".  It is to strain the meaning of  that  phrase  to
    apply it in circumstances such as this.  The evidence did not go to the
    genuineness  or  to  the  validity  of  a  document.   It  was  instead
    corrective evidence designed to address and deal with what was said  to
    have been an error by an accountant at an earlier stage.   On  a  plain
    reading of section 85A(iv)(c), it cannot apply in  this  case  and  the
    evidence ought not to have been considered by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge. It was not open to the Judge to exercise some broad jurisdiction
    to include evidence on the basis he may have thought it just and proper
    to do so, in his words, to correct "an innocent error on  the  part  of
    the accountants".

7.   These matters amount to a clear  error  of  law  on  the  face  of  the
    determination and for that reason alone it  must  be  set  aside.   The
    reference to Appendix FM, as I have already indicated, is  meaningless,
    and is a further ground for  setting  aside  this  determination.   The
    discussion under Article  8  is  cursory  in  the  extreme.   The  only
    suggestion that Article 8  might  be  engaged  is  the  possibility  of
    disruption to the schooling of the children.

8.   In all those circumstances, having set aside the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, the question is what  to  do  about  the  original
    decision that the Immigration Rules  were  not  satisfied  and  on  the
    evidence I have seen that remains  the  case.   In  setting  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, I reinstate and  affirm  the
    decision reached by the Secretary of State on 15 May 2014.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

The decision made on behalf of the Secretary of State  on  15  May  2014  is
    reinstated.

No anonymity direction is made.
