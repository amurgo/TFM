Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Jafar, Counsel instructed by Lee Valley
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, a national of Pakistan,  date  of  birth  24  May  1984,
    appealed against the respondent's decision, dated 5 November  2014,  to
    make removal directions under Section 10 of the Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 1999, a human rights based claim having been  refused  and  a  form
    IS151A having been served on 5 November 2014.

2.   The matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge M J H  Wilson  who  on
    25 January 2015 dismissed the appeal with reference to the  Immigration
    Rules, particularly paragraph 2295D of the Immigration Rules HC 395, as
    amended, under the partnership route within Appendix FM  of  the  Rules
    relating to family members and under  private  life  considerations  at
    paragraph 276ADE.   The judge also dismissed the appeal with  reference
    to Article 8 of the ECHR outside of the Rules on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant  had  not  established  that  there  were  any   special   or
    exceptional circumstances about his family or private life in the UK to
    warrant a consideration under Article 8 of the ECHR.

3.   The judge made no findings on whether the appellant  had  a  family  or
    private life in the United Kingdom but simply concluded that the public
    interest  considerations  were  not   outweighed   by   "any   of   the
    considerations in relation to the appellant's  private  or  his  family
    life in the United Kingdom as shown to exist."   The  judge  also  took
    into account the appellant's lack of immigration status in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Accordingly the judge  concluded  that  there  were  no  good
    grounds for considering the appeal, with reference to Article  8  ECHR,
    outside of the Rules and it followed  that  there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised by the Rules.

4.   It is clear that with the respondent's decision of  5th  November  2014
    there was a One-Stop Warning under  Section  120  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which  required  in  the  form  of  the
    notice of appeal to provide further reasons which were to  be  sent  to
    the respondent in ten working days.

5.   The notice was served on 7 November.  The deadline for  the  notice  of
    appeal was 21 November 2014.

6.   By letter dated and sent to the Home Office on  21  November  2014  the
    grounds contained specific claims that the appellant was  the  extended
    family member of an EEA national, a qualified person, exercising treaty
    rights in the UK under the 2006 Immigration (EEA) Regulations.

7.   The judge did not address that ground  and  accordingly  there  was  an
    error of law under Section 86(2) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  There is no substantive  challenge  to  the  way  the
    judge determined the Article 8 issues albeit Mr Jafar argued  that  the
    deficiencies disclosed in the judge's consideration of  the  matter  at
    paragraphs 11 to 13 of the decision raise the  Robinson  obvious  point
    that the judge had not properly considered it but rather had sought  to
    maintain that there was a preliminary threshold to  be  crossed  before
    considering the case under Article 8.  However,  Mr  Jafar's  principal
    submission was under the 2006Regulations

8.   As a matter of historical context an earlier decision by the  Secretary
    of State to refuse leave to remain in 2011, which  did  not  attract  a
    right of appeal, led to a judicial review  and  the  decision  was  set
    aside by order of Mr Justice Blake on 15 March 2011.  It is clear  that
    permission was granted because there was a subsisting claim of  seeking
    to remain on the basis of the appellant being the durable partner of an
    EEA national under the 2006 Regulations.  It is sufficient to note that
    over three years passed before a revised decision by the respondent was
    made in November 2014.

9.   Prior to the respondent's decision in  November  2014  the  appellant's
    representatives, Lee Valley Solicitors, had written to the Secretary of
    State once again drawing to the  Secretary  of  State  the  appellant's
    claim to remain on the basis of a durable and subsisting  relationship.
    There was never any response  from  the  Secretary  of  State  to  that
    letter.

10.  Contained  within  the  files  relevant  to  the  EEA  claim  that  the
    appellant was an extended family member under Regulation 8 of the  2005
    regulations, was evidence which clearly showed the EEA national sponsor
    was  in  employment  at  material  times,  the  parties  were   sharing
    accommodation and sponsor was exercising treaty  rights.   In  November
    2014 Reasons for Refusal Letter the Secretary  of  State  accepted  the
    appellant's partner was an EEA national, Jolita Grybauskiene, currently
    resident in the United Kingdom  and  it  was  acknowledged  "that  your
    client has a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  his  partner".
    The evidence had been advanced along  the  lines  that  they  had  been
    together for some four years.

11.  The Secretary of State  considered  the  position  of  the  appellant's
    partner under the Rules, that is the Immigration  Rules.   Nothing  was
    said vis ï¿½ vis her as an EEA national exercising treaty rights.  It was
    noted of course with reference to the requirements at the time that the
    appellant had applied for,  and  obtained  a  certificate  of  approval
    (marriage) on 29 March 2010 in order to  marry  his  partner  and  such
    certificate was  issued  on  15  February  2011.   It  seems  that  the
    appellant and EEA national partner had  entered  into  a  Muslim  faith
    marriage but, as yet, had not married in a civil ceremony in the United
    Kingdom.

12.  Mr Nath accepted that the evidence  showed  a  subsisting  and  genuine
    relationship for he could not go behind  the  concession  made  by  the
    respondent in that respect.  Accordingly, there really was no basis  to
    do so with reference to the 2006 EEA Regulations.

13.  In  addition  Mr  Nath  did  not  raise  any  issue  on  the  financial
    information  that  had  previously  been  provided  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and continued, subject to some updating even as of today
    to show that the sponsor was in employment.

14.  Accordingly, I find as a fact the appellant  was  and  is  an  extended
    family member, being  in  a  durable  relationship  and  that  the  EEA
    national  sponsor  is  working  and  meets   the   qualified   person's
    requirements under the 2006 Regulations.

15.  In light of Ihemedu [2011] UKUT 340  it  is  clear  to  me  that  under
    Regulation 17(4) that it is a matter for the Secretary of State whether
    this is appropriate in all the circumstances  to  issue  the  residence
    card.

16.  In these circumstances the Original Tribunal decision cannot stand.  In
    the light of the submission made the following decision is substituted.



17.  Dependent upon the circumstances of  the  case,  if  the  Secretary  of
    State was to refuse the application for a residence permit the  Section
    84(1)(d) this would  not  trigger  a  right  of  appeal  under  Section
    84(1)(d) because the appellant would not  be   an  EEA  national  or  a
    member of the family of an EEA national within the discreet meaning  of
    Regulation  7.   However,  such  a  decision   would   attract   almost
    inevitably, a claim to remain based on Article 8 of the ECHR.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The appeal is  allowed  to  the  extent  that  the  application  for  a
    residence  permit  under  the  2006  Regulations  is  returned  to  the
    Secretary of State for determination in accordance with the law.

    No anonymity direction is made.
