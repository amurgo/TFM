                     ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER - NEW DELHI
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Duncan of Counsel, instructed by N. C. Brothers
                    & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him or any member of his  family.   This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal who was  born  on  [  ]  1985.   He
    applied for entry clearance to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    dependent child of K B R, a former Gurkha soldier.  On 8 July 2015  the
    application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer.  The  appellant
    appealed against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal.

    The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3. In a determination promulgated on 19 October 2016  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Nixon dismissed the appellant's appeal.  The Tribunal found  that
    Article 8 was not engaged  because  the  appellant  did  not  have  any
    emotional dependence on the sponsor.

 4. On 15 October 2016 the  appellant  applied  for  permission  to  appeal
    against the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

 5. In essence the grounds of appeal are that the judge failed to  consider
    the history of  Gurkha  cases  in  assessing  family  life,  failed  to
    consider the features of Annex K to the IDIs that the  appellant  could
    meet, that there was  no  consideration  of  the  purpose  of  righting
    historic injustice, that the judge failed to consider family  life  was
    only severed when the parents and the appellant's sister  came  to  the
    UK, failed to identify when family life ceased and that the  judge  was
    in error in not considering the unfairness of the two  year  separation
    test in the particular circumstances of this case.   On  8  March  2017
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Gibb  granted  the  appellant  permission  to
    appeal.

    The Appeal before the Upper Tribunal

    Submissions

 6. The grounds of appeal as amplified by Mr Duncan in oral submissions are
    interrelated.   Mr  Duncan  submitted  that  the  First-tier   Tribunal
    approached the assessment as to whether or not there  was  family  life
    incorrectly and failed  to  take  into  consideration,  when  assessing
    family life, the particular features that arise  in  Gurkha  dependency
    cases.

 7. He submitted that in Ghising  &  Ors  (Ghurkhas/BOCs:  historic  wrong;
    weight) [2013] UKUT  00567  (IAC)  the  proportionality  assessment  is
    normally in  favour  of  an  appellant.   In  Gurkha  cases  there  are
    particular factors that  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  when
    assessing family life.  He submitted that the wider  issues  concerning
    the historic injustice feed into the assessment of Article 8.

 8. Mr Duncan submitted that prior to the change in policy in 2015 the test
    was that a dependent child must satisfy the respondent that there  were
    exceptional circumstances. It was suggested at  the  hearing  that  the
    appellant applied when the rules changed rather than the  reason  given
    that he had  not  been  able  to  afford  the  fees  earlier.  Had  the
    appellant's father, i.e. the sponsor, settled in the United  Kingdom  a
    year later in 2013 then the appellant in this case would have satisfied
    the two year  separation  Rule.   The  two  year  separation  Rule  was
    arbitrary and  unfair  and  in  this  case  discriminated  against  the
    appellant merely because the sponsor had settled in the United  Kingdom
    in 2012 rather than 2013.

 9. He submitted that the separation of the appellant from his family  must
    be seen in the context of the historic right that the appellant had  to
    come to the UK when he was a child.  The requisite standard in relation
    to Article 8 in terms  of  emotional  dependency  does  not  take  into
    account the reason for separation in this case.  The  probative  nature
    of the policy undermines the Article 8(1) assessment.

10. He submitted that if family life was in existence in 2012 the judge has
    failed to show or find when that family life ended.  The  judge  failed
    to  attach  any  weight  to  the  appellant's  inability  to  make   an
    application at a time when he was under the age of  18  when  he  would
    have been automatically entitled to settle in  the  UK.   The  historic
    injustice must, as a minimum, carry weight in the assessment of  family
    life in considering the reasons for which  the  appellant  and  sponsor
    have been separated.

11. The judge failed to attach any weight to the factors that the appellant
    can satisfy of paragraph 9 of  Annex  K  -  Adult  Children  of  Former
    Gurkhas of Chapter 15, Section 2A when assessing whether  Article  8(1)
    is engaged.  The judge failed to attach weight to the  acceptance  that
    an application would have been made to settle  in  the  United  Kingdom
    upon completion of the Gurkha's service and that the appellant has  not
    formed an independent family unit.

12. The judge failed to consider the intention of the policy found at Annex
    K, namely that there should be a mechanism to assist the settlement  of
    over-age children of former Gurkha soldiers in an  attempt  to  rectify
    the historic injustice.  The judge failed to consider that  the  family
    unit had resided together intact until 2012.  It was clear that  as  of
    2012 when the appellant lived with the sponsor in  Nepal  Article  8(1)
    was engaged.

13. Ms Isherwood submitted that  there  is  no  challenge  to  the  adverse
    findings regarding the sponsor's  evidence.   She  indicated  that  the
    sponsor's daughter came to the UK as a student and not as  a  dependant
    of the sponsor under the Gurkha settlement policy.  She submitted  that
    the Secretary of  State's  policy  on  settlement  of  adult  dependent
    children was applied to the appellant's case but it was found  that  he
    did not meet the requirements.  That was conceded by the  appellant  at
    the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

14. She submitted that the two year Rule is of little  importance  in  this
    case because the appellant and sponsor's evidence is  that  the  reason
    they did not apply for the appellant to come to  the  UK  in  2012  was
    because they could not afford to do so.  This was  the  driving  factor
    with regard to the length  of  time  of  separation.   The  appellant's
    grounds are a simple disagreement with the Secretary of State's policy.

15. With regard to ground 3 she submitted that the judge was  not  required
    to consider the intention behind the policy.  The  judge  did  consider
    all the evidence but did not accept the evidence of the  sponsor.   She
    referred to paragraph 7 of the First-tier Tribunal decision  where  the
    judge set out the appellant's evidence with regard to his income.

16. Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge, at subparagraph 11 (7), did  not
    accept the evidence as credible with regard to the sponsor's  assertion
    that he had not visited the appellant in Nepal as he could  not  afford
    the travel costs and subparagraph 11(8) where the Tribunal did not find
    the sponsor to be a credible  witness,  that  he  contradicted  himself
    several times in  evidence  and  was  evasive  in  answering  seemingly
    straightforward  questions.   None  of   these   findings   have   been
    challenged.

17. She submitted that the grounds in essence are a disagreement  with  the
    finding that Article 8 is not engaged but the only  reasons  given  are
    consideration of issues that do not directly  address  the  fundamental
    question which  was  whether  or  not  the  appellant  was  emotionally
    dependent on the sponsor.  She submitted that almost every paragraph of
    the grounds related to the weight to be attached  to  certain  matters.
    The weight to be attached was  a  matter  for  the  judge.   The  judge
    considered the case law of Gurung & Ors, R (on the  application  of)  v
    SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 8.  The judge records that in this appeal there is
    a lack of evidence to support emotional dependence.

18. In reply Mr Duncan submitted that the Tribunal had adopted too narrow a
    focus and ought to have taken into consideration the background to  the
    historic injustice and the background to this particular case.

    Discussion

19. The First-tier Tribunal notes at the outset that  the  only  issue  was
    whether family life existed between the appellant and the sponsor.

20. The judge's conclusions were set out from paragraph 11:

         "11. I have considered all of  the  evidence  before  me  and  have
             reached the following conclusions:

             (1)  As was rightly conceded by Mr Duncan,  I  find  that  the
                  appellant cannot meet the criteria of Annex K or  Appendix
                  FM.

21. It was conceded that the appellant could not meet the  requirements  of
    the Rules and did not fall within the terms of the policy  set  out  in
    Annex K. The appellant's arguments in respect of the judge  failing  to
    consider the factors that could be met at annex K  are  irrelevant.  So
    too is the argument that the judge failed to consider the intention  of
    the policy. The policy exists to  assist  the  settlement  of  over-age
    children of former  Gurkha  soldiers  in  an  attempt  to  rectify  the
    historic injustice. Mr Duncan did not submit that the policy itself was
    challenged.

22. The judge considered Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules:

             11 (2)   As to the consideration of Article 8, I bear in  mind
                  the decision in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387  and  find
                  that there are compelling circumstances in this case  that
                  cause me to go on to consider Article 8 outside the Rules.
                   I have  therefore  gone  on  to  consider  whether  their
                  Article 8 rights would be breached by this refusal and  as
                  a starting  point,  I  remind  myself  of  the  sequential
                  questions laid down by Lord Bingham in Razgar [2004]  UKHL
                  27.

             (3)  I have been referred by Mr  Duncan  to  the  decision  in
                  Gurung & Ors, R (on the application of) v SSHD [2013] EWCA
                  Civ 8 regarding the issue of proportionality and I  accept
                  that it is now well-established that, where Article  8  is
                  engaged and, but for the  historic  wrong,  the  appellant
                  would have settled in the UK some time ago, that this will
                  usually determine the  issue  of  proportionality  in  the
                  appellant's favour,  although  it  is  not  determinative.
                  This point has in fact been sensibly conceded by Mr Swaby.
                   The only issue for me to determine is whether  Article  8
                  is engaged at all in this case, that is  to  say,  whether
                  family life exists between the appellant and his parents.

23. Mr Duncan's submitted that the historic injustice must, as  a  minimum,
    carry weight in the  assessment  of  family  life  in  considering  the
    reasons for which the appellant and sponsor have  been  separated.  The
    assessment as to whether or not there is family life is a  question  of
    fact. In Ghising (family life - adults -  Gurkha  policy)  [2012]  UKUT
    00160 (IAC) (as endorsed by the Court of appeal in  Gurung)  the  Upper
    Tribunal held:

         62. The different outcomes  in  cases  with  superficially  similar
         features emphasises to us that the  issue  under  Article  8(1)  is
         highly fact-sensitive. In our  judgment,  rather  than  applying  a
         blanket rule with regard to adult children,  each  case  should  be
         analysed on its own facts, to decide whether  or  not  family  life
         exists, within the meaning of Article 8(1).

24. The correct approach to consideration of Article 8(1) in cases such  as
    the instant case has recently been considered in Rai v Entry  Clearance
    Officer, New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320:

         42. Those circumstances of the appellant and  his  family,  all  of
         them uncontentious, and including - perhaps crucially  -  the  fact
         that he and his parents would have applied at  the  same  time  for
         leave to enter the United Kingdom and would have come to the United
         Kingdom together as a family unit had they been able to  afford  to
         do so, do not appear to  have  been  grappled  with  by  the  Upper
         Tribunal judge under article 8(1). In  my  view  they  should  have
         been.

25. I do not consider that the judge in this case  has  failed  to  grapple
    with the issues as identified in Rai. In that case  the  focus  of  the
    Upper Tribunal was on the fact that the appellant's parents had  chosen
    to leave the appellant:

          38. Throughout  his  findings  and  conclusions  with  regard  to
          article 8(1),  the  Upper  Tribunal  judge  concentrated  on  the
          appellant's parents' decision to leave Nepal and  settle  in  the
          United Kingdom, without, I think, focusing on the  practical  and
          financial realities entailed in that decision. This  was,  in  my
          opinion, a mistaken approach.

          39.  The  Upper  Tribunal  judge  referred  repeatedly   to   the
          appellant's  parents  having  chosen  to  settle  in  the  United
          Kingdom, leaving the appellant in the family home in Nepal.  Each
          time he did so, he stressed the fact that  this  was  a  decision
          they had freely made: "... not  compulsory  but  ...  voluntarily
          undertaken ..." (paragraph 20), "... having made  the  choice  to
          come  to  the  [United  Kingdom]"  (paragraph   21),   "...   the
          willingness of the parents to leave ..." (paragraph 23), and "...
          their voluntary leaving of Nepal and leaving the  Appellant  ..."
          (paragraph 26). But that, in my view, was  not  to  confront  the
          real issue under article 8(1) in this case, which was whether, as
          a matter of fact, the appellant had demonstrated that  he  had  a
          family life with his parents, which had existed at  the  time  of
          their departure to settle in the United Kingdom and  had  endured
          beyond it, notwithstanding their having left Nepal when they did.
          [Emphasis added]

26. It is worth setting out in full the judge's conclusions  and  reasoning
    in respect of family life:

             11 (4)   I have heard evidence from  the  sponsor  and  accept
                  that the  appellant  is  financially  dependent  upon  his
                  father.  I note that the appellant is unemployed, but I am
                  conscious that the unemployment rate in Nepal is high.   I
                  have  heard  of  no  particular   circumstances   in   the
                  appellant's case which  lead  him  to  be  unemployed  and
                  therefore assume that  is  simply  down  to  the  lack  of
                  employment in  the  country.   Financial  support  of  the
                  unemployed adult child is  expected  in  Nepalese  society
                  and, to some extent, in British society and I therefore do
                  not  find  this  financial  support  in  isolation  to  be
                  indicative of ties over and above the norm.

             (5)  I accept that the appellant  is  in  regular  contact  by
                  phone and Viber with his parents but this is  something  I
                  would expect of  family  members  living  apart  and  this
                  contact does not in my  judgment  point  towards  anything
                  over and above the usual emotional ties.  I note that  the
                  appellant is unmarried but I have  heard  no  evidence  of
                  social isolation.  He has lived all of his life  in  Nepal
                  and would have established a network of friends.   I  have
                  not been told that  his  living  conditions  are  anything
                  other than adequate and I note that  he  lives  in  rented
                  accommodation paid for by his father.

             (6)  The appellant states in his  witness  statement  that  he
                  suffers from depression but I have not been provided  with
                  any medical evidence to substantiate  this  assertion  nor
                  any evidence to suggest that this contention is caused  by
                  separation from his parents.  Accordingly I  place  little
                  weight on this assertion.  This is certainly  no  evidence
                  to suggest  that  he  is  not  capable  of  looking  after
                  himself.  I find therefore that,  but  for  his  financial
                  dependence on their  father,  he  is  self-sufficient  and
                  managing to carry out his day-to-day life as  is  expected
                  of an adult of his age.  I find that there is no  evidence
                  to suggest that the appellant is not functioning  normally
                  in the  absence  of  his  parents,  either  physically  or
                  emotionally.

             (7)  The sponsor stated that he had not visited the  appellant
                  in Nepal since coming to the UK in 2012 as  he  could  not
                  afford the travel costs.  I do not accept this evidence as
                  credible.  I have heard evidence that  the  sponsor  earns
                  �18,000 net per annum and receives contributions of around
                  �800 per month from his daughter and I find therefore that
                  he would have amply funds to pay for his travel  costs  to
                  visit son.  I find that had there been emotional ties over
                  and above the norm between parent and child,  the  sponsor
                  would have been to see his son on at least one occasion.

             (8)  I did not find the sponsor to be a credible  witness.   I
                  find  that  he  contradicted  himself  several  times   in
                  evidence  and   was   evasive   in   answering   seemingly
                  straightforward questions.  When asked questions regarding
                  his daughter with whom he lived in the UK, he stated  that
                  she was financially dependent upon him.  This could not be
                  correct in light of  his  evidence  that  she  contributed
                  substantially to the monthly household costs.  Furthermore
                  I do  not  accept  as  plausible  that  he  did  not  know
                  precisely what employment his daughter was in  or  whether
                  she worked full or part-time, not only because  they  live
                  in the same house but also because he paid for her studies
                  and  would  therefore  have  shown  an  interest  in   her
                  subsequent employment.  I find that the sponsor was trying
                  to paint a picture of more straitened finances in order to
                  attempt to justify his lack of visits to his son in Nepal.
                   Mr Duncan urged upon me to treat the  sponsor's  evidence
                  with some caution as he was  giving  evidence  through  an
                  interpreter but I reject this submission.   It  was  quite
                  clear to me that the sponsor  and  interpreter  understood
                  each other perfectly well and I find that the sponsor only
                  became hesitant and evasive  when  being  asked  questions
                  regarding his daughter's employment and finances.

             (9)  I find that had there been any real emotional  dependence
                  and concern about the appellant's  health,  I  would  have
                  expected the sponsor to have made at  least  one  trip  to
                  Nepal.  Indeed I have been provided with  little  evidence
                  as to how the appellant is emotionally  dependent  on  his
                  parents or how he is affected by being separated from  his
                  parents, other than the  obvious  remark  that  he  misses
                  them,  which  I   would   expect   in   any   parent/child
                  relationship.

             (10) The critical issue before me is whether the appellant has
                  shown that there is sufficient emotional dependence on his
                  parents to justify the conclusion that they enjoyed family
                  life and I find that he has failed to show  this.   Whilst
                  he is financially dependent upon his father, I find  that,
                  although the usual emotional  bonds  between  parents  and
                  child are  present,  the  requisite  degree  of  emotional
                  dependence is absent in this case.  I find therefore  that
                  the appellant has failed to show that there is family life
                  and that Article 8  is  engaged.   The  appeal  must  fail
                  accordingly."

27. The appellant had been living apart from  his  father  and  mother  for
    nearly 3 years at the time the application was made. As  found  by  the
    judge  the  sponsor  "earns  �18,000  net  per   annum   and   receives
    contributions of around �800 per month from his  daughter  and  I  find
    therefore that he would have amply funds to pay for his travel costs to
    visit his son". These findings were not appealed. There  would  clearly
    have therefore been ample costs to have made an application during  the
    2 years 11 months period. The judge was not required to make a specific
    finding as to whether or not the appellant had had a family  life  with
    his parents before they left Nepal or identify the point  at  which  it
    ceased. The question is (assuming that it  was  in  existence  at  some
    point) whether that had endured. The judge having taken all the factors
    into account found that it had not. This was a finding that was open to
    the judge on the evidence.

28. It was submitted that requiring applications  to  be  made  within  two
    years of separation results in unfairness.   Had  the  sponsor  delayed
    exercising his right to settle by over one  year  the  appellant  would
    have been able to satisfy this term of the  policy  and  has  therefore
    been adversely impacted by the sponsor exercising his  right  in  2012.
    There is no merit  in  this  ground  of  appeal.  Whether  or  not  the
    appellant had made his application within 2 years he would  still  have
    had to demonstrate that there was family life that engaged  article  8.
    As held in Patel, Modha & Odedra v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Mumbai)
    [2010] EWCA Civ 17 paragraphs 14 and 15:

         "You can set out to compensate for  a  historical  wrong,  but  you
         cannot reverse the passage of time... By the time they come to seek
         entry clearance, adult children may well no longer be part  of  the
         family life of British overseas citizens who have  finally  secured
         British citizenship. If so, the threshold of  art.  8(1)  will  not
         have been crossed and the proportionality of  excluding  them  will
         not be an issue."

29. There were  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision.


The appeal is dismissed. The Entry Clearance Officer's decision stands.
