Representation:

For the claimant: Ms V Laughton, instructed by Wilsons Solictors
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The claimant, Zamichael Tesfagergish,  date  of  birth  10.9.81,  is  a
    citizen of Eritrea.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Nichols  promulgated  6.3.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated
    14.7.14, to remove him  from  the  UK  to  Italy,  where  he  has  been
    recognised as a refugee.  The appellant appealed against that  decision
    on human rights grounds. The Judge heard the appeal on 6.3.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    12.5.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Nichols should be set aside.

 6. The lengthy grounds of appeal submit that in allowing  the  appellant's
    appeal on article 3 EHCR grounds,  on  the  basis  that  he  would  not
    receive adequate support and assistance if returned to Italy, where  he
    is a recognised refugee, the judge erred in law. First, in  failing  to
    engage with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights  as  to
    the method of assessing whether there had  in  fact  been  failures  in
    Italy. Second, it is submitted that this resulted in a failure to  make
    findings of relevant issues, such as whether the appellant reported ill-
    treatment to the police, or sought medical treatment,  or  applied  for
    assistance.

 7. In granting permission to appeal Judge Robertson  considered  that  all
    grounds are arguable.

 8. I have taken account of Ms Laughton's Rule 24 response, dated 4.6.15.

 9. Mr Tufan accepts that at �19 the judge correctly set out  the  relevant
    test, namely whether it  had  been  shown  by  the  evidence  that  the
    proposed removal of the claimant to Italy demonstrated a real risk that
    he would suffer treatment contrary to article 3  ECHR.  At  �4  of  the
    grounds it is submitted that the correct  legal  approach  is  that  in
    Hussein and others v The Netherlands & Italy  2775/10  -  Admissibility
    Decision [2013] ECHR 1341: "Whether taken from a material  physical  or
    psychological perspective, disclose a sufficiently  real  and  imminent
    risk of hardship severe enough to fall within the scope of Article  3."
    It appears to me that this is essentially the same test/approach.

10. Ms Laughton complains  that  the  Secretary  of  State  is  relying  on
    Hussein, which was a decision on admissibility,  to  the  exclusion  of
    other more recent authority, including those referred to by the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, including EM (Eritrea) [2014]  UKSC  12,  and  the
    decision of the Grand Chamber of Tarakhel v Switzerland  (29217/12),  a
    decision issued on 4.11.14. Mr Tufan responded  by  pointing  out  that
    Tarakhel involved a  family  including  6  children  where  there  were
    particular vulnerabilities, and thus the conclusion that the return  of
    that family to Italy would be in breach of article 3 unless  the  Swiss
    authorities first  obtained  individual  guarantees  from  the  Italian
    authorities that the family would be kept  together  and  the  children
    dealt with in a way appropriate to their age. Regard has to be  had  to
    the particular vulnerabilities of the individuals concerned.

11. Mr Tufan relied on the recent Judicial Review application case of R (on
    the application of Weldegaber) v SSHD  (Dublin  Returns  -  Italy)  IJR
    [2015] UKUT 70 (IAC), in which the President reviewed the various  case
    authorities and held that in  Tarakhel  the  European  Court  of  Human
    Rights was not purporting to promulgate a  general  rule  or  principle
    that a sending state is required to secure specific assurances from the
    destination state as to accommodation or the like. The President stated
    that the conclusion in Tarakhel  is  inextricably  bound  up  with  its
    highly fact sensitive context. Further, the  President  was  unable  to
    conclude that even if accommodation were not immediately  available  to
    the appellant for a limited period it would be sufficient  to  overcome
    the article 3 threshold of a serious risk that he would be  exposed  to
    inhuman or degrading treatment. There has  to  be  a  presumption  that
    Italy will comply with its international obligations.

12. There are a number of cases cited by Mr Tufan and �11 of  the  grounds,
    including Hussein, in which it has been held that  whilst  the  general
    situation and living conditions of asylum seekers and accepted refugees
    in Italy may disclose some shortcomings,  it  has  not  been  shown  to
    disclose a systemic failure to provide support.  None  of  these  cases
    were referred to by the First-tier Tribunal.

13. However, it is clear from the case law referred to by both  sides  that
    essentially there has to be  a  fact-finding  exercise  by  the  judge,
    considering not only the general situation on the ground in the country
    of  proposed  destination  but  also  the   claimant's   circumstances,
    including his or her previous experience.

14. I am satisfied that  the  judge  carefully  considered  the  background
    evidence including reports. However, it is not  entirely  clear  to  me
    that the report from an attorney in  Rome  on  the  Italian  system  of
    international protection can properly be described as an expert report,
    though relied on by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  at  �25.  The  judge
    did,  however,  cite  thereafter  a  number   of   reports   suggesting
    deficiencies in the  Italian  asylum  system,  which  were  taken  into
    account.

15. I find that the difficulty with the decision  is  in  relation  to  the
    ground of appeal that the judge failed to  make  findings  on  relevant
    issues. The judge did set out the appellant's claimed  history  between
    �6 and �14 of the decision. However, the findings of fact  at  �28  are
    rather limited, stating, "I find that the appellant has  shown  a  real
    likelihood that he lived on the streets in Italy for  up  to  2  years,
    depending on charities  for  food,  unable  to  find  accommodation  or
    employment and subject to abuse and, on one occasion, physical assault.
    I find the appellant to be a  credible  witness  in  respect  of  those
    matters. I also find that he is  a  person  with  some  vulnerabilities
    because of the medical situation in the report...  which  set  out  the
    various marks and injuries which the appellant suffered  prior  to  his
    arrival in Italy and  concluded  that  he  has  suffered  psychological
    consequences from his traumatic experiences."

16. It is not so much that the judge failed to make findings of  fact,  but
    that the evidence before the judge  was  demonstrably  insufficient  to
    demonstrate that the claimant met the article 3 threshold of  risk.  As
    set out at �11 of the decision, the claimant stated that  in  Italy  he
    was not ill and did not need to see  a  doctor.  He  had  been  granted
    refugee status and issued with the 'soggiorno'  residence  permit,  but
    had not been given a travel document  or  identity  card  which  it  is
    claimed he would require to access medical care.  But  he  had  neither
    required nor tested the  need  for  medical  treatment,  and  there  is
    insufficient evidence to suggest that he would be unable to do  so,  if
    needed. A theoretical acceptance by the judge that he  would  now  need
    medical treatment because of  injuries  and  stress  occasioned  before
    arriving in Italy, is a far cry from finding that because of this issue
    the claimant's circumstances the article 3 threshold is met.

17. Similarly, although the claimant asserted that on one occasion  he  and
    another Eritrean had been abused and assaulted, he did not report it to
    the police, because he believed nothing could be done about it, feeling
    that he could not approach the authorities because they knew  perfectly
    well the situation in which he and  other  refugees  were  living.  The
    reality is that he was as much entitled to  protection  of  the  police
    against assault as an Italian national. That he  decided  not  to  seek
    such protection cannot, on that ground, amount to a real risk  that  he
    would suffer treatment in breach of article 3.

18. The claimant's account is that he was obliged to leave a refugee  camp,
    because his asylum claim had been accepted, and told to  make  his  own
    arrangements for accommodation. He relied  on  churches  for  food  and
    water and went to  Catania  where  he  was  able  to  access  overnight
    accommodation, but could  not  find  work  and  spent  his  days  doing
    nothing. He could not obtain work, partly because of language  problems
    and partly because of the absence of work opportunities. The judge  has
    made no finding that his failure to obtain work was attributable to the
    Italian authorities' breach of  article  3,  rather  than  the  general
    economic difficulties faced by the population at large,  compounded  by
    his inability to speak Italian.

19. Rather than remaining in Catania, he went to Rome and  found  temporary
    work washing cars. He found accommodation in a squat, but slept on  the
    streets during the summer. In summarising the appellant's evidence  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge does not state that the claimant was  refused
    assistance from the authorities and makes no findings as to whether the
    appellant made any enquiries for assistance when in Rome. In  fact  the
    evidence does not demonstrate that the  claimant  ever  sought  refugee
    assistance from the authorities after  leaving  Catania.  The  claimant
    believes that if he returned to Italy he was sure that he would have to
    go back on the streets, without any support, but the evidence on  which
    to conclude that is so is absent from the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

20. In summary, I find merit in the complaint of the grounds that the judge
    has failed to properly consider  and  take  into  account  whether  the
    claimant ever sought  assistance  in  finding  work  or  accommodation,
    either within the scope of special public or private social  assistance
    schemes for refugees or other vulnerable persons. Having  accepted  the
    claimant's evidence as credible, it does not  necessarily  follow  that
    his fears as to what his situation would be on return are well-founded.
    As  explained  above,  much  of  his  evidence  demonstrates  that   he
    apparently did not seek assistance or protection. I bear in  mind  that
    it is not for me to supplant  the  judge's  proper  assessment  of  the
    evidence and findings of fact just because I or another judge may  have
    reached a different conclusion on the evidence. However,  the  findings
    and conclusions have to be reasoned and  open  to  the  judge  on  that
    evidence. I am not satisfied that they were. In  the  circumstances,  I
    find that the judge has failed to provide cogent reasons for concluding
    that the claimant's evidence can properly demonstrate a  real  risk  of
    hardship severe enough to fall within article  3,  and  thus  that  the
    decision must be set aside.

21. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts and conclusions  to
    be drawn therefrom are unclear on a crucial issue at the  heart  of  an
    appeal, as they are in this case, effectively  there  has  not  been  a
    valid determination of those issues. I further note that in  this  case
    it is likely that substantial further  evidence  will  be  adduced.  Ms
    Laughton stated her intention to call  live  evidence  from  a  country
    expert in Italy, possibly by video link.

22. In all the circumstances, and at  the  invitation  of  Ms  Laughton  to
    relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I do
    so on the basis that this is a case which  falls  squarely  within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

23. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the remaking of the decision to be heard in  the
                    First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

24. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House, on a
    date to fixed, with an estimate of four hours;

25. The claimant's representatives should  be  consulted  as  to  available
    dates for representatives and witnesses to attend;

26. The claimant's representatives should prepare a revised, comprehensive,
    indexed  and  paginated  single  bundle  of  relevant  subjective   and
    objective material upon which the claimant intends to rely;

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
