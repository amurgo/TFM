For the Appellant:      Mr D Byrne, Advocate, instructed by Drummond
Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:  Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) The appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on 21 April 1983.   He  appeals
   to the Upper Tribunal against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Watters, promulgated on 7 June 2013.




2) The grounds are as follows:

   1. The FtT heard an appeal against a decision  to  refuse  to  grant  the
      applicant leave  as  a  self  employed  business  person  pursuant  to
      paragraph 4 and 21 of HC510, the 1973 After Entry Business Provisions,
      still in force as a result of the  "standstill  provisions"  (s.  2(1)
      European Communities Act 1972, Art 41 of Additional Protocol of 1970).


   2. To succeed an applicant should meet paragraph 4 and 21, they read:

           "4.   The succeeding paragraphs set out the main  categories  of
           people who may be given limited leave to enter and who may  seek
           variation of their leave, and the principles to be  followed  in
           dealing with their applications, or in initiating any  variation
           of their leave.  In deciding these  matters  account  is  to  be
           taken of all the relevant facts; the  fact  that  the  applicant
           satisfies the formal requirements of these rules  for  stay,  or
           further stay, in the proposed capacity is not conclusive in  his
           favour.  It will, for example, be relevant  whether  the  person
           has observed the time limit and conditions subject to  which  he
           was admitted; whether in the light of his character, conduct  or
           associations it is undesirable to permit him to remain;  whether
           he represents a danger to  national  security;  or  whether,  if
           allowed to remain for the period for which he wishes to stay, he
           might not be returnable to another country ...


           Businessmen and self-employed person


             21. People admitted as visitors may apply for  the  consent  of
                 the Secretary of State  to  their  establishing  themselves
                 here for the purpose of setting up in business, whether  on
                 their own account or as  partners  in  a  new  or  existing
                 business.  Any such application is to be considered on  its
                 merits.  Permission will depend on  a  number  of  factors,
                 including evidence that  the  applicant  will  be  devoting
                 assets of his own to  the  business,  proportional  to  his
                 interest in it; that he will be able to bear his proportion
                 of any liabilities the business may  occur;  and  that  his
                 share of its profits will be sufficient to support him  and
                 any dependants.  The applicant's part in the business  must
                 not amount to disguised employment, and it  must  be  clear
                 that he will not have to supplement his business activities
                 by employment for which a work permit is  required.   Where
                 the applicant intends to join an existing business, audited
                 accounts should be  produced  to  establish  its  financial
                 position, together with a written statement of the terms on
                 which he is to enter into it;  evidence  should  be  sought
                 that he will be actively concerned  with  its  running  and
                 that  there  is  a  genuine  need  for  his  services   and
                 investment.   Where  the   application   is   granted   the
                 applicant's stay may be extended for a period of up  to  12
                 months, on a condition  restricting  his  freedom  to  take
                 employment.  A person admitted  as  a  businessman  in  the
                 first instance may be granted an appropriate  extension  of
                 time of stay if the conditions  set  out  above  are  still
                 satisfied at the  end  of  the  period  for  which  he  was
                 admitted initially."

   3. The determination gives two  reasons  for  rejecting  the  applicant's
      claim.  Firstly  it  should  be  noted  that  the  applicant  met  the
      requirements of paragraph 21 (see �8 of the determination), those  are
      the requirements to demonstrate  a  qualifying  business.   Those  two
      reasons are that the applicant was an overstayer and secondly that  he
      commenced his business prior to applying for leave to  remain.   Those
      two considerations are relevant to paragraph 4 of HC510.


   4. The FtT rejected the applicant on the footing that the applicant began
      his business prior to applying for leave to  remain  and  there  is  a
      public interest in persons not  doing  so.   The  FtT  concluded  that
      reason sufficient, along with him  having  no  leave,  to  reject  his
      application in considering matters under paragraph 4.

Error 1

   5. The FtT erred in  law  in  failing  to  take  into  account  that  the
      applicant:


        a. Entered the UK lawfully for a lawful purpose (studies)
        b. Has not committed fraud or been dishonest
        c. The public interest in promoting free movement and  the  gradual
           integration of Turkey into the European Union


   6. In relation to (a) that is  plainly  a  material  factor  and  one  of
      significance to the Advocate General Kokott in Oguz (cited at  �62  of
      KA (Turkey) v Secretary of State [2012] EWCA Civ 1183).


      "52. The assessment should therefore be no different in  a  case  like
      the main proceedings where, unlike  the  cases  already  decided,  the
      person relying on the standstill clause even had leave to  remain  and
      had merely breached a condition of that leave.  Lastly, the  applicant
      in the main proceedings did not enter the United  Kingdom  unlawfully,
      but had entry clearance  and  even  a  work  permit,  albeit  not  for
      activity of a self-employed person.  Only by taking up activity  of  a
      self-employed person, which he soon ceased  again,  did  he  breach  a
      condition of his leave to remain." (emphasis added).


   7. Those factors were regarded by the English Court of Appeal  in  KA  as
      relevant factors, see 62, per Rix LJ,


      "Although Advocate General Kokott was speaking of the applicability of
      the  standstill  clause,  not  of  the  operation  of  the  discretion
      exercised by the national authorities under the  appropriate  national
      rules, it is clear that  the  factual  distinctions  which  she  there
      adverts to, and which have a clear resonance  for  the  present  case,
      were considered by her to be relevant distinctions for the exercise of
      that discretion" (emphasis added).


   8. The FtT erred in law in failing to take  that  relevant  positive  and
      distinguishing factor into account.


   Error 2


   9. The FtT erred in law in  failing  to  ask,  notwithstanding  that  the
      applicant had commenced his business prior to applying, whether he had
      sought to take "any  advantage  of  commencing  trading  in  order  to
      leverage his position" [see Rix , LJ at 93].  That was regarded in  KA
      as a relevant factor in the paragraph 4 assessment  vis-�-vis  persons
      applying after they had commenced their business.


   Error 3


  10. The FtT assess whether the public policy issues in this case justify a
      refusal of the application.  In particular the FtT at 12 hold that the
      public policy of discouraging or  penalising  work  without  leave  is
      sufficiently weighty to render the application a failure in  terms  of
      paragraph 4.  The FtT erred in law failing to identify that the public
      policy in relation to an over-stayer requires a consideration of  "the
      extent of any overstaying  and  how  culpable  the  applicant  was  in
      becoming an overstayer".  In treating overstaying of itself as a basis
      to refuse the FtT erred in law, the respondent identifies  the  extent
      and nature  of  overstaying  as  necessary  additional  categories  of
      assessment in judging whether public policy demands  a  refusal.   The
      FtT erred in law in failing to take that into  account  or  in  asking
      only part of the question.

3) Upper Tribunal Judge McKee  granted  permission  on  the  view  that  the
   grounds made an arguable case that the appellant did not fall within  the
   "fraud exception" and that public  policy  did  not  require  him  to  be
   refused leave to remain.
4) Mr  Mullen  acknowledged  that  the  determination  is  apparently  self-
   contradictory between paragraph 11, where the judge says that overstaying
   and starting a business without permission does not justify refusal,  and
   paragraph 12, where he finds that it does.  However,  he  said  that  the
   error was not to the appellant's  ultimate  disadvantage.   Paragraph  11
   missed the point which could be derived from paragraph 51 of KA:

    We now know ... that even in a true case of fraud or abuse  of  rights,
    the standstill clause still applies.  We also know ... that a breach of
    conditions in jumping the gun in the  commencement  of  an  applicant's
    proposed business need be neither fraudulent, nor an abuse  of  rights,
    nor tantamount to other.  An abuse of rights only arises where ...  the
    right is claimed by virtue of its abuse.


5) Mr Mullen submitted that the appellant had  overstayed  and  ignored  the
   rules at the time he started his business.  In terms of  paragraph  4  of
   HC510 that was relevant, and should in  the  circumstances  be  decisive.
   The business started almost 2  years  after  the  appellant's  leave  had
   expired.  He said that refusal of his student application  was  technical
   or even wrong in law but he had the opportunity to challenge it  and  did
   not do  so.   The  judge  did  not  fully  take  into  account  that  the
   application was based on an abuse.  The  correct  course  for  the  Upper
   Tribunal would be to set aside the First-tier Tribunal determination, but
   to reach a  fresh  decision  again  dismissing  the  appeal.   Mr  Mullen
   accepted that the only adverse factor was that the business had not  been
   started within the appellant's leave but as an overstayer.   However,  he
   had done so well into that period and so was invoking  the  right  in  an
   abusive manner.

6) Mr Byrne  said  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  observation  at
   paragraph 11 that  starting  the  business  without  permission  was  not
   sufficient on its own to justify refusal was correct.  The  spectrum  ran
   from that of the "casual transgressor" to the  "systematic  cheat".   The
   appellant's immigration history was relevant.  He  had  the  offer  of  a
   place on a suitable course  (page  324  of  his  principal  inventory  of
   productions in the First-tier Tribunal).  His application was refused for
   technical reasons (page 328).  He produced a photocopy not an original of
   his  Turkish  qualification  (which  had   presumably   been   previously
   established to the  satisfaction  of  the  respondent)  and  he  provided
   evidence of funds dated more than a month prior to his application.   Not
   only were these reasons merely technical, they were contained at the time
   in guidance not in the Rules, so the appellant might have  had  a  remedy
   upon appeal.  This took him  out  of  the  class  of  those  who  entered
   unlawfully or used fraud and dishonesty.   It  was  not  a  significantly
   adverse history.  The business established is genuine, not a contrivance.
    The decision to be substituted should be in the appellant's favour.

7) It was common ground that a fresh decision is required;  that  it  should
   be informed as to the nature and extent of the "fraud exception"  by  KA;
   and that the fresh decision is a discretionary one in terms of the Rules,
   and now for the Upper Tribunal.

8) I do not find the dicta on the extent to which overstaying  affects  this
   type  of  case  entirely  clear.   It  appears   that   the   matter   is
   discretionary, and ultimately depends on the individual facts.   In  this
   case the abuse amounts to overstaying and setting up business in  advance
   of the application.  The immigration history is adverse to a degree,  but
   very far from the worst.  The  appellant  is  not  an  entirely  innocent
   transgressor, but not a systematic cheat.  There is nothing which  smacks
   of fraud.  On balancing all the  considerations  to  which  I  have  been
   referred, I think that discretion should be exercised in the  appellant's
   favour.

9)  The  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
   following decision is substituted: the appeal, as originally  brought  to
   the First-tier Tribunal, is allowed.

10) Presumably the result is likely to be a grant of  leave  to  remain  for
   the usual initial period under the standstill clause, whatever  that  may
   currently be; but not having been addressed  on  the  point,  I  make  no
   formal direction.

11) No anonymity order has been requested or made.
