Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Burrett, instructed by Morgan Mark Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   I issued a decision  and  directions  in  this  case  on  15  May  2013
    following a hearing on 16 April 2013 where I heard submissions from  Mr
    Burrett and Mr Norton.

2.   At paragraph 14 of  the  decision  and  directions  I  indicated  that,
    subject to any submissions to the  contrary  received  within  fourteen
    days of promulgation of the determination, I would remit the appeal  to
    the judge who had heard the matter in the First-tier for  him  to  make
    proper findings under Article 8 of the  Human  Rights  Convention.   No
    submissions have been received from either party, and accordingly  this
    appeal is remitted to Judge Youngerwood at  Taylor  House  for  him  to
    complete his determination by making proper findings under Article 8 of
    the Human Rights Convention.






Signed                                  Date
