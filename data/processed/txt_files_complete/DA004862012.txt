                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a determination of a panel of the  First-
        tier Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'the  Panel')  who  in  a
        determination promulgated on the  21st February 2013 dismissed  the
        appellants appeal against the order for his  deportation  from  the
        United Kingdom made pursuant to section 32 UK Borders Act 2007.


     2. The appellant was born on the 27th April 1972 and is a  citizen  of
        Bangladesh. He entered the United Kingdom on the 4th February  1996
        as a spouse and on 3rd February 1997 was granted  indefinite  leave
        to remain (ILR).


     3. On 25th January 2002 he was convicted at Leicester Crown  Court  of
        conspiring/obtaining property by deception  and  was  sentenced  to
        nine months imprisonment. On 15th January 2004 he was convicted  at
        Reading Crown Court of obtaining property by deception and on  20th
        February 2004 he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment.


     4. On 7th April 2004  the  appellant  was  served  with  a  notice  of
        liability to deportation. On 25th October 2005 he was issued with a
        warning letter advising him that he was not to be deported on  this
        occasion but that if he came to adverse notice in the  future,  the
        Secretary of State would further  consider  whether  he  should  be
        deported.


     5. An application for naturalisation was refused on 13th December 2007
        due to his criminal convictions.


     6. On 28th June 2010 he was convicted of possession of a Class A  drug
        and was sentenced to one day imprisonment and a ï¿½15 fine.


     7. On 26th August 2012, at Snaresbrook Crown Court, he  was  convicted
        after trial of three counts of possession of a Class  A  drug  with
        intent to supply and one count of possession of a Class A drug  and
        sentenced to a total of six years imprisonment.


     8. On 24th November 2010 the appellant was sent notice of liability to
        deportation and on 6th July 2012  made  the  subject  of  a  signed
        deportation letter.


     9. The Panel noted the presence of a wife and four  daughters  in  the
        UK. The children were born in 1996, 1999, 2002 and 2005.  They  are
        all British citizens.


    10. The findings of the Panel are set out at paragraphs 32 - 68 of  the
        determination. The key findings can be summarised as follows:


     i.   If the appellant is deported it must be accepted that  the  family
   will           be fractured for the foreseeable future. [48]


     ii.  The appellant's attitude to the crime for which he  is  serving  a
          sentence is said to be "telling and inconsistent". The Panel  were
   not            satisfied that he recognises the  serious  nature  of  the
   offences and            consider that his recent protestations of remorse
   are more likely to           stem from his desire  to  avoid  deportation
   rather than acceptance of             guilt. The panel  noted  the  OASys
   report recording that as recently as          December 2012 the appellant
   denied having drugs for supply, for            which  he  was  convicted.
   [49]


     iii. The OASys report assessed the appellant as being a low risk of re-
          offending but does not say why this is so. [58]


     iv.  On 18th January 2012 UKBA  requested  a  report  from  the  London
   Borough  of  Tower  Hamlets.  The  Panel   summarised   the   conclusions
   of the report including noting that on 30th July 2007  an  initial  Child
      Protection  Conference  was  convened  and  the  children   made   the
   subject of a child protection plan under the category of neglect.   At  a
      subsequent  conference  on  23rd  October  2008   the   category   was
   changed  to  emotional  abuse  following   the   return   home   of   the
   appellant when he assumed  responsibility  for  the  basic  care  of  the
   children. The report noted that the home was  raided  by  the  police  on
     a  number  of  occasions  and  that  the  children  witnessed  physical
     fights resulting in the police being called. It was also noted that the
              family were re-housed following a planning meeting in November
              2008 following their experiencing anti-social behaviour.  [59]




     v.   The report is unsatisfactory  as  it  fails  to  address  relevant
   issues but              did reveal that the appellant has lived by deceit
   for a number of              years. [60]


     vi.  The appellant's wife's health issues are revealed by a  number  of
     hospital appointments and letters from her GP. [63]


          vii.    There is no medical or social work reports supporting  the
   claim the           appellant's wife's ailments prevent her  from  caring
   for  the  children.             The  evidence  does   not   support   the
   appellant's claim that he has been             the  main  carer  for  the
   children in the past; despite claims by  family               members  to
   the contrary. [64]


          viii.   The appellant's children will be devastated if he  was  to
   be deported.            The practical consequences of deportation may  be
   that social services             will have to assess the family needs for
   support services and                  counselling. Any  deterioration  in
   the performance of the children at            school will no doubt result
   in referral to the local authority. [65]


          ix. The Panel took into account that the welfare of  the  children
   is a                primary  consideration  and  the  assessment  of  the
   appellant as                 presenting a low risk of re-offending.  They
   weighed against this the              appellant's deceit, his failure  to
   recognise the seriousness of the                   offense, the  fact  he
   has known since 2005 that he is at risk  of                   deportation
   if   he   committed   further   offences,    and    the    finding    his
   involvement in the day to day care of the children is  not  as  extensive
     as he attempted to portray. It was also found the appellant  spent  his
     formative  years  in  Bangladesh  and  can  re-establish  himself  back
   there.  Bar  immediate  family  he  has  established  no  ties  with  the
     community in the UK. Notwithstanding  the  distress  his  removal  will
     cause to the children and the  loss  of  advantage  to  them  of  their
     father's presence, the Panel found that his conduct is so  contrary  to
     the public   interest as to  make  such  separation  proportionate  and
     justified.


    11. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge of the  First-
        tier Tribunal Zucker, on the 22nd  March  2013,  in  the  following
        terms:


     4.   On one view the grounds do not point to any arguable error of  law
     since pregnant  in  the  grounds  is  the  acceptance  that  the  panel
   determined  the  appeal  in  accordance  with  domestic   law.    However
   the grounds do point to arguable errors of law if it can  be  established
   that  the  domestic  law  may  be  wrong  in  light  of  the   Strasbourg
   jurisprudence.  Whilst I have  some  reservations  in  granting  leave  I
   am of the view that the points may deserve an airing.


    12. Before the Tribunal Mr Malik referred to the recently reported case
        of SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550, including  the  fact  that  in
        that case the appellant had no leave  to  remain  in  the  UK,  and
        thereafter submitted  that  the  Panel  had  erred  in  failing  to
        undertake the necessary evaluation of the extent and welfare of the
        children. He submitted the Panel failed to consider the  children's
        welfare and that as  it  was  accepted  that  deportation  will  be
        devastating for the children the balance should have fallen in  the
        appellants favour based upon SS.


    13. In relation to the  issue  upon  which  permission  to  appeal  was
        actually granted Mr Malik made no further submissions other than to
        reserve  his  position.  He  accepted  that  Mr  Justice  Burnett's
        decision meant it was unrealistic to expect me to depart  from  the
        judgment although Mr Malik clearly believes the courts position  is
        wrong.


    14. The application is opposed by the respondent.


Discussion



    15. When drawing together the threads of their earlier  discussions  in
        SS (Nigeria) the Court of Appeal state, in paragraph 47, that in  a
        child case the right in question (the child's  best  interests)  is
        always a consideration of substantial importance. In  paragraph  55
        they state:


              55.      None of  this,  I  apprehend,  is  inconsistent  with
   established principle, and                the approach I have outlined is
   well supported by  the  authorities                       concerning  the
   decision-maker's   margin   of   discretion.    The    leading    Supreme
   Court cases, ZH and H(H), demonstrate  that  the  interests  of  a  child
   affected                by a removal decision are a matter of substantial
   importance, and that the                  court must proceed on a  proper
   understanding of the facts which                        illuminate  those
   interests  (though   upon   the   latter   point   I   would   not   with
   respect accept that the decision  in  Tinizaray  should  be  regarded  as
          establishing anything in the nature of general principle). At  the
   same time               H(H)  shows  the  impact  of  a  powerful  public
   interest (in that case                    extradition) on what  needs  to
   be demonstrated for an Article 8 claim to                   prevail  over
   it.  Proportionality,  the  absence  of  an  "exceptionality"  rule,  and
     the meaning  of  "a  primary  consideration"  are  all,  when  properly
          understood, consonant with the force to be attached  in  cases  of
   the present                  kind to the two  drivers  of  the  decision-
   maker's margin of discretion: the                   policy's  source  and
   the  policy's  nature,  and   in   particular   to   the   great   weight
   which the 2007 Act attributes to the deportation of foreign criminals.


    16. This in an appeal by an  individual  who  was  convicted  of  three
        counts of possession of a Class A drug with intent  to  supply  and
        one count of possession of a Class A drug and sentenced to a  total
        of six years imprisonment. He is also the subject of an order  made
        by virtue of the provisions of the UK Borders Act, which is primary
        legislation.  On 25th October 2005 he was  issued  with  a  warning
        letter advising him that he was not to be deported on that occasion
        but that if he came to adverse notice in the future  the  Secretary
        of State would further consider  whether  he  should  be  deported.
        Despite this his offending escalated.


    17. The Panel clearly considered the best interests of the children and
        accepted this  was  a  primary  consideration  but  found,  on  the
        evidence,  this  was  outweighed  by  the  countervailing   factors
        referred to in the determination. I do not find it proved the Panel
        failed to consider all the available evidence with  the  degree  of
        care required of them and they  have  given  adequate  reasons  for
        finding as they did in the respondents favour. In SS (Nigeria)  the
        Court of Appeal found that the case  law  shows  the  impact  of  a
        powerful public interest and what needs to be demonstrated  for  an
        Article 8 claim to prevail over it. This case involved  the  supply
        of drugs which destroy  lives  of  individuals  and  threatens  the
        fabric of society. There is a clear and powerful  need  to  protect
        the public from the effect of drugs.  The  Panel  found  there  was
        insufficient evidence  produced  to  allow  them  to  find  in  the
        appellant's favour. The weight they  gave  to  the  evidence  is  a
        matter for them: see SS (Sri Lanka) [2012] EWCA Civ 155. I find  no
        legal error  has  been  proved  in  relation  to  the  finding  the
        deportation is proportionate. This is in effect a disagreement with
        the findings made and weight given to the evidence by the Panel.


    18. Permission to appeal was granted on the  issue,  stated  to  be  of
        general importance in the grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal,
        namely  the  apparent  conflict  between  the  domestic   law   and
        Strasbourg jurisprudence concerning marriage  based  on  Article  8
        ECHR claims. The core element of this submission  is  that  on  the
        basis of the domestic authorities it was not open to the First-tier
        to conclude that the removal of the appellant in consequence of the
        immigration decision would be proportionate.


    19. Mr Malik reserved his position in relation to this element  of  the
        grounds and made no further submissions but neither did he withdraw
        the ground, which is the only one on which  permissions  to  appeal
        was granted.


    20. The grounds refer to the case  of  R  (Kotecha)  [2011]  EWHC  2070
        (Admin). It is submitted that in that case before Burnett J, it was
        common ground that the domestic law had "parted company"  with  the
        approach of the Strasbourg Courts and that as a result the  removal
        of people who are the partners of people present and settled in the
        United Kingdom has become almost  impossible,  at  least  in  cases
        which do not involve those convicted of serous criminal offences.


    21. The above refers to paragraph 3 of the judgement in which Burnett J
        records the views of the advocates appearing  before  him,  one  of
        which was Mr Malik. Having undertaken an extensive  examination  of
        the Strasbourg and domestic case law Burnett J states in  paragraph
        52 of the judgment:


              52. From all this it follows that I do not accept the  central
   submissions from                 both counsel that the House of Lords has
   developed the law on Article 8 in                  the United Kingdom  in
   a way that has parted company with Strasbourg.                   Just  as
   the proper approach to article  8  was  once  wrongly  equated  with  the
     'insurmountable  difficulty'  test  so  now  it  may  be  that  another
              inappropriate substitute for the careful weighing  of  factors
   has been found                   in 'reasonable to  remove',  without  an
   appreciation that  such  a  test  itself                engages  all  the
   factors   identified    by    Strasbourg.     Similarly,    whilst    the
   expectation in cases  involving  removal  of  one  spouse  to  enable  an
          application to be made from abroad according to the rules is  that
                   comparatively  rarely  will   it   be   a   proportionate
   requirement, all depends on               the facts.


    22. In paragraph 57 Burnett, J stated:




              57. I am also unable to accept Mr Malik's submissions that  it
   is not longer a                  factor to be weighed that a marriage was
   contracted whilst an individual's                  immigration status was
   precarious.  Such a submissions is inconsistent with                  the
   Huang, EB (Kosovo) and Chikwamba. The question in these cases, as in  all
              article 8 cases, is whether the interference which  will  flow
   to the family life               of the claimant and his  or  her  family
   members  from  removal  is  in  all   the                   circumstances
   proportionate.   I  readily  accept  that  the  interests   of   children
     affected by any decision to remove, or any decision which will  require
   the                 separation of parents  and  children,  is  a  primary
   consideration: ZH                     (Tanzania).


    23. I do not find it proved there is any divergence in law between  the
        UK's domestic case law  and  that  of  Strasbourg  in  relation  to
        deportation appeals, which is the appeal being  considered  by  the
        Tribunal in this case.  SS (Nigeria) contains a  valuable  analysis
        of relevant authorities [paras 13 -31].  In deportation appeals, as
        in all Article 8 ECHR cases, if it is found protected rights exist,
        the issue is one of proportionality. This requires a fact sensitive
        analysis as Burnett J,  the  Court  of  Appeal,  and  others,  have
        recognised on many occasions.


Decision

    24. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    25. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


          I continue that  order  (pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
   Procedure               (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
