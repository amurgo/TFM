                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal Ford (the judge), promulgated on 15 May  2018,  dismissing
        the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision  dated  22
        August 2017 refusing his Article 8 human rights claim.





   Background


     2. The appellant is a national of Ghana born in 1971. He first came to
        the UK as a visitor in 2001 and last entered  the  UK,  also  as  a
        visitor, in 2006.  He  overstayed.  He  met  his  partner,  also  a
        Ghanaian national, around 2002/2003.  They  have  4  children  born
        between 17 December 2006 and 30 November  2015.  The  oldest  is  a
        British citizen, presumably by registration  under  s.1(4)  of  the
        British Nationality Act 1981. The appellant also has a child from a
        previous relationship who he brought to the UK in 2006. At the date
        of the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  the  appellant's  partner,
        three of her children and the appellant's child from  his  previous
        relationship had been granted Discretionary Leave to  Remain  until
        November 2018.


     3. As accurately noted by the judge, the appellant  has  a  very  poor
        immigration history. This includes making an application for an EEA
        residence card using false documents and giving  a  false  identity
        and making an unfounded asylum claim. An earlier appeal  against  a
        decision to refuse his asylum claim was dismissed in 2010.

     4. In May 2016 the appellant was sentenced  to  4  years  imprisonment
        relating to dishonesty offences. Over a period of about 7 years  he
        deceived the British authorities into parting  with  an  excess  of
        ï¿½146,000. The respondent unsurprisingly made  a  deportation  order
        against the appellant and  refused  his  human  rights  claim.  The
        appellant appealed the refusal of his human rights  claim  pursuant
        to s.82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (the
        2002 Act).


     5. Prior to his appeal in the First-tier Tribunal  the  appellant  was
        represented by Acharyas  Immigration  Solicitors.  Two  bundles  of
        documents in support of the appellant's appeal were filed with  the
        First-tier Tribunal on 16 and 17 January 2018. In a letter sent  by
        fax to the First-tier Tribunal on 27 March 2018, and sent by letter
        in the post on the same day, Acharyas Solicitors stated,  "we  have
        been informed by the appellant that he is to represent  himself  in
        the above hearing. We would request we come  off  record  as  legal
        representatives for the above named." At the time of his appeal the
        appellant was a serving prisoner at HMP Huntercombe.

     6. No alternative representatives were instructed. The  appellant  was
        not legally represented at his appeal hearing on 26 April 2018.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

     7. The judge set out the appellant's immigration and criminal  history
        in some detail,  including  relevant  sections  of  the  Sentencing
        Remarks. The judge correctly directed herself  in  respect  of  the
        burden and standard of proof. At [20] the  judge  referred  to  the
        Court of Appeal decision in MM (Uganda) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ  450
        which held that, when considering whether  deportation  would  have
        "unduly harsh" consequences the tribunal had to have regard to  all
        of  the  circumstances,  including  the  deportee's  criminal   and
        immigration history. This was understood to be  the  law  when  the
        First-tier Tribunal's decision was made.


     8. The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant, his  partner  and
        his daughter, R, by another relationship. The judge summarised  the
        oral evidence at [23] to [33].  The  judge  found  the  appellant's
        partner to be an inconsistent and unreliable witness and found that
        handwritten letters she sent to the  appellant  whilst  he  was  in
        custody were calculated to manipulate the tribunal  into  sympathy.
        In the absence of any  medical  evidence  the  judge  rejected  the
        partner's claim that she  was  suicidal  or  suffered  from  mental
        health difficulties. The judge  was  satisfied  that  she  and  the
        appellant were in a genuine and subsisting relationship. The  judge
        found that the best interests of the minor children were served  by
        the appellant remaining with the family in the  UK.  The  appellant
        was said to be a "loving father" to  his  children  and  they  were
        attached to him [39], and that he  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
        parental relationship with them [45].

     9. The judge directed herself in accordance with paragraph 399 of  the
        immigration rules and s.117C(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and
        Asylum Act 2002 in respect to the 'very  compelling  circumstances'
        test. The  judge  was  not  however  satisfied  that  the  evidence
        disclosed  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
        identified in paragraph 399 and Exception 2  in  s.117C(5)  of  the
        2002 Act. The judge noted that the children were in good health and
        found that their mother could continue to care for  them.  At  [48]
        the judge stated,

             "Exception 2 does not assist him because taking  into  account
             P's poor  immigration  history  and  the  seriousness  of  his
             criminal offending, and measuring this against the  impact  of
             his removal on him, his partner and his  children,  I  am  not
             satisfied that the decision is unduly harsh as defined  in  MM
             (Uganda) (above)." [sic]

    10. And at [49] the judge stated,

             "Taking into account the  Appellant's  very  poor  immigration
             history and  his  offending  behaviour,  the  children's  best
             interests and the  impact  upon  all  family  members  of  his
             removal and balancing this against the strong public  interest
             in P's removal from the UK,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  this
             decision is unduly harsh in  terms  of  being  excessively  or
             inordinately harsh even taking full account of the  impact  on
             the children. P will either have to live separately  from  his
             children, seeing them on holidays when they can  get  together
             in Ghana or elsewhere, or the children will have to adapt to a
             very different way of life in Ghana if that is their  parents'
             choice. I do not accept  that  Article  8  demands  that  this
             family be permitted to continue their family life  in  the  UK
             rather than elsewhere. I'm satisfied  that  this  decision  is
             entirely  justified   given   the   criminal   offending   and
             immigration history of the Appellant. It goes no further  than
             is necessary  to  protect  the  public  interests  stated.  It
             involves a  proper  balancing  of  the  competing  public  and
             private  interests  including  the  best  interests   of   the
             children. It is a proportionate decision and does  not  breach
             protected Article 8 rights."

    11. The appeal was accordingly dismissed on human rights grounds.

The challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's decision and the 'error  of  law'
hearing

    12. The grounds contend that it was not until the appellant arrived  in
        immigration detention in January 2019 that he was made  aware  that
        he would be entitled to publicly  funded  legal  representation  in
        relation to his deportation matter. The grounds  contend  that  the
        appellant was wrongly informed by prison  staff  that  he  was  not
        eligible for legal aid, and that his previous legal representatives
        ceased to represent him as he could no longer afford  their  feeds.
        The grounds contend that the appellant would have been entitled  to
        legal aid advice and representation  under  section  10  LASPO  and
        that, with the benefit of legal representation, he would have  been
        represented before the First-tier Tribunal.  The  grounds  contend,
        somewhat speculatively, that the  appellant  would  have  at  least
        moderate  prospects  of  success  had  he  the  benefit  of   legal
        representation.  The  grounds  did  not  particularise  how   legal
        representation at the First-tier Tribunal  hearing  would,  in  his
        particular circumstances, have "shifted" (employing the  term  used
        in the grounds) the balance in  his  favour.  It  was  nevertheless
        argued that the lost opportunity to obtain legal aid representation
        had a significant impact on the fairness of the proceedings.


    13. In granting  permission  to  appeal  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Storey
        considered it arguable that it was procedurally unfair of the judge
        to  proceed  with  the  hearing  even  though  the  appellant   was
        unrepresented and noted that there was no self-direction  from  the
        judge to indicate that  consideration  was  given  to  whether  the
        appellant, by virtue of  being  in  detention,  had  had  a  proper
        opportunity to receive publicly funded legal help.

    14. At the outset of the 'error of law' hearing I raised with the party
        the judge's reliance  on  MM  (Uganda)  at  [20],  [48]  and  [49].
        Although the judge's approach to harshness was in  accordance  with
        binding authority at the date of her decision,  this  approach  has
        subsequently been held to be wrong. In KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC  53
        the Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal's decision  in  MM
        (Uganda).  In  short,  the  issue  of  undue  harshness  is  to  be
        determined by reference to the impact  on  the  relevant  child  or
        partner and not by reference to the deportee's immigration  history
        or the seriousness of his or  her  offence.  Although  the  present
        appeal  was  concerned  with  the  existence  of  'very  compelling
        circumstances' over and  above  the  unduly  harsh  impact  on  the
        children  (or  partner),  in  determining  what  constitutes  'very
        compelling circumstances' it will normally be necessary to lawfully
        identify the (non) existence of  factors  that  render  the  impact
        unduly harsh. As the judge, through no fault of  her  own,  applied
        the wrong test in determining whether the impact  on  the  children
        would be unduly harsh, her assessment of  the  existence  of  'very
        compelling circumstances' commenced from the wrong reference point.




    15. After a brief discussion both  representatives  accepted  that  the
        judge's  assessment  of   the   existence   of   'very   compelling
        circumstances' was fatally contaminated by her application  of  the
        test in MM (Uganda) and that this constituted a material  error  of
        law.

Discussion

    16. The judge  took  into  account  the  appellant's  poor  immigration
        history  and  the  seriousness  of  his  criminal  offending   when
        determining that his deportation would not  have  an  unduly  harsh
        impact on his children [48]. For the reasons  set  out  above,  and
        through no fault of her own, the judge applied the wrong  test  (KO
        (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53). Although the appellant had  to  persuade
        the judge that there were 'very compelling circumstances' over  and
        above the unduly harsh impact on his children in order  to  succeed
        in his appeal, such an assessment could only properly  be  made  if
        there had already been a lawful assessment of undue harshness. This
        was not disputed by either representative at  the  'error  of  law'
        hearing.


    17. In Greenwood (No. 2) (para 398 considered) [2015] UKUT 00629  (IAC)
        the former President of the Upper Tribunal (IAC) held, at [14]

             "Logic, reason and common sense dictate  that  paragraphs  399
             and 339A must be considered in the application  of  the  "over
             and above" test enshrined in paragraph 398. Indeed  a  failure
             to do so, if material, would itself be an  error  of  law.  In
             cases where, as here, the "over and above"  test  is  engaged,
             paragraphs 399 and 399A provide the bridge, or  link,  between
             the application of the test and the resulting outcome."

    18. Although Mr Justice McCloskey was considering paragraphs 398 399 of
        the immigration rules  there  can  be  no  material  difference  in
        approach to undue harshness under s.117C(6).  In  NA  (Pakistan)  v
        SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 662 (at [37]), Lord Justice Jackson stated,

             "In relation to a serious offender, it will often be  sensible
             first to see whether his case involves  circumstances  of  the
             kind described  in  Exceptions  1  and  2,  both  because  the
             circumstances so described set  out  particularly  significant
             factors bearing upon respect for private  life  (Exception  1)
             and respect for family life (Exception 2) and because that may
             provide a helpful basis on which an  assessment  can  be  made
             whether there are "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
             above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2"  as  is  required
             under section 117C(6)."

    19. The interaction between paragraphs 398 and 399 of  the  immigration
        rules, and between s.117C(6) and s.117C(5) of the 2002  Act,  will,
        in most cases, require a judge to undertake a lawful assessment  of
        undue harshness. On the facts of the present appeal  the  appellant
        had 5 children in the UK, including a British  citizen  child,  who
        had been rendered destitute after his incarceration. Whilst it  may
        have been open to the judge to conclude  that  the  impact  on  the
        children would not have been  unduly  harsh  if  she  had  properly
        applied the KO (Nigeria) test, it cannot be said  that  this  would
        inevitably have been her conclusion. Nor can it be  said  that  she
        would inevitably have concluded that there were no 'very compelling
        circumstances'  over  and  above  any  unduly  harsh  impact.   I'm
        consequently satisfied that the judge's decision must be set aside.


    20. For the reasons given above it is not necessary for me to  consider
        the grounds of appeal relating to the fairness of the proceedings.

    21. Having heard representations from the parties and having regard  to
        Part 3 of the Practice Directions: Immigration and Asylum Chambers,
        and in light of the passage of time and the likelihood  of  further
        evidence becoming available, I consider it appropriate to remit the
        matter back to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  heard  afresh  by  a
        judge other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ford.


Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by material  errors  on  points
of law and is set aside.

The decision will be  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  to  be
determined afresh by a judge other than Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Ford.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  in
this appeal is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.  This
direction applies both to the appellant and to the  respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
