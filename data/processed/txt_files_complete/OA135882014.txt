                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a female citizen of Iraq born on 11th June 1989.   She
    applied along with her dependent daughter for entry clearance to the UK
    as the spouse of the Sponsor, B I M.  That application was refused  for
    the reasons given in a Notice of Decision dated  24th  September  2014.
    The Appellant appealed, and her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Loughridge (the Judge) sitting at Newport on 14th September 2015.
     He decided to allow the appeal for the reasons given in  his  Decision
    dated 16th September 2015.  The Respondent sought leave to appeal  that
    decision, and on 28th January 2016 such permission was granted.

 2. I should explain that also on 16th September 2015 the  Judge  dismissed
    the appeal of the Appellant's daughter under the Immigration Rules  and
    also on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  That decision has not been  challenged
    by the Appellant's daughter.

Error of Law

 3. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 4. The sole issue before the Judge was whether the Appellant had  produced
    the evidence specified by paragraph E-ECP.3.2 of Appendix FM of HC  395
    in order to satisfy paragraph E-ECP.3.1.  The Judge allowed the  appeal
    because he  found  the  Sponsor  to  have  a  gross  annual  income  of
    �20,065.76 which exceeded the sum of �18,600 and therefore was adequate
    to maintain the Appellant.   The  Judge  found  that  the  Sponsor  was
    employed by Chickys Fast Food Restaurant where he  was  paid  in  cash,
    although the Appellant was able to supply a  number  of  payslips  from
    that employer.  The Sponsor was also employed  by  Napolita  Restaurant
    where again he was paid in  cash  but  was  able  to  produce  payslips
    showing the amount.  The  Judge  also  considered  the  Sponsor's  bank
    statements showing various deposits.

 5. At the hearing, Mr Mills argued that the Judge  had  erred  in  law  in
    coming to this conclusion as he had  failed  to  take  account  of  the
    provisions of Appendix FM-SE in respect of cash income.  This  provided
    that gross cash income can only be taken into account if the amounts in
    payslips  corresponded  with  bank  deposits  shown  in  a   statement.
    Otherwise only the net income could be taken  into  account.   In  this
    case, there was no such corresponding evidence, and therefore the Judge
    should have taken into account only the net earnings of  the  Appellant
    which were well short of the threshold of �18,600 per annum.

 6. In response, Ms Kullar argued that there  was  no  such  error  of  law
    although she did not address the ground relied upon by  Mr  Mills.   Ms
    Kullar informed me  that  the  Appellant's  child  was  now  a  British
    citizen, and pointed out that the Judge had made no assessment  of  the
    Appellant's Article 8 ECHR rights.

 7. I find an error of law in the decision of the Judge which  therefore  I
    set aside.  The error of law  is  that  argued  by  Mr  Mills.   It  is
    apparent from reading paragraphs 14 to 18  of  the  Decision  that  the
    Judge relied upon the gross earnings of the Sponsor whereas  he  should
    have taken into account  only  the  net  earnings  in  accordance  with
    Appendix FM-SE.  This makes a difference as to whether the  Appellant's
    earnings exceeded the threshold figure  of  �18,600  and  is  therefore
    material.

 8. I did not proceed to remake the decision as there were relevant matters
    not considered by the Judge such as  the  Appellant's  Article  8  ECHR
    rights.  I therefore decided to remit  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for the  decision  to  be  remade  there  in  accordance  with
    paragraph 7.2(b) of the Practice Statements.



Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside that decision.

The decision will be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order for anonymity  which  I  continue  for
the reasons given by the First-tier Tribunal.
