Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr C Boyle, Halliday Reeves Law Firm
For the Respondent:        Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, precluding publication of  any  information  regarding
the proceedings which would be likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
identify the appellant because of the matters identified at [16] to [19]  of
the Judge's decision and because there is no public interest in  identifying
the appellant.

2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge  Hindson  promulgated  on  18/05/2017,  which  dismissed  the
Appellant's appeal on all grounds.


Background


3. The Appellant was born on 01/01/1995 and is a national  of  Ethiopia,  of
Somali  ethnicity.  On  16/03/2016  the  Secretary  of  State  refused   the
Appellant's protection claim.


The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Hindson ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision.


5. Grounds of appeal  were  lodged  and  on  06/09/2017  Judge  Dineen  gave
permission to appeal stating

      1. The appellant seeks permission to appeal, in time allowing for  the
      course of post in sending the decision to  the  appellant,  against  a
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hindson) who, in a decision
      promulgated on 18/05/17 dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  the
      respondent's decision to refuse her international protection.


      2.  The  appellant's  case,  set  out  with  admirable   clarity   and
      succinctness, boils down to the question whether, given conditions  of
      violence in the appellant's home  area  which  are  described  in  the
      decision, in  particular  at  [29]  meet  the  article  15(c)  of  the
      qualification directive.


      3. To be granted permission to appeal, the appellant  must  show  that
      there is an arguable case that the Judge made a material error of law.


      4. An error of fact may amount to an error of law if, but only if, the
      Judge-


           .  Failed to take into account a material fact.
           .  Took into account an immaterial fact.
           .  Acted perversely by reaching  a  factual  decision  which  no
             reasonable Judge could have made on the evidence.
           .  Failed to give adequate reasons for  a  material  finding  of
             fact.


      5. Relevant principles set out in the judgement of the Court of Appeal
      in Hamid v Khalid [2017] EWCA Civ 201 in particular at [26 - 30]


      6. I am satisfied that it  is  at  least  arguable  that  the  Judge's
      findings at [30] falls within the criteria above.

The Hearing

6. (a) Mr Boyle moved the grounds of appeal. He told me  this  case  is  all
about  article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive  and  the  risk  of
indiscriminate violence to the appellant  in  her  home  area.  He  took  me
straight to [29] of the decision and told  me  that  there  the  Judge  made
findings which favour the appellant. At [29] the Judge found that  there  is
ongoing violence in the appellant's home area  and  that  the  police  there
commit atrocities. The Judge finds at [29] that  the  appellant  is  a  lone
female without protection.

(b) Mr Boyle referred me to [30] of the decision and told me that there  the
Judge finds that the level of violence in the  appellant's  home  area  does
not cross the threshold to engage article 15(c). He told me that there is  a
contradiction between [29] and [30], and that [30] of the decision does  not
contain adequate reasoning, particularly in light of the  findings  made  in
[29]. He asked me to allow  the  appeal  and  to  set  the  decision  aside,
preserving the findings at [29], and then to remit the case  to  the  First-
tier for full consideration of the reasonableness of relocation.

7. For the respondent, Mr Diwnycz told  me  that  this  had  been  a  finely
balanced appeal, but that the decision is a  difficult  decision  to  defend
because internal relocation has not been considered. He  told  me  that  the
Home Office position is that even if there is  an  internal  armed  conflict
sufficient to engage article 15(c) of the  Qualification  Directive  in  the
appellant's home area, then internal relocation is  still  a  viable  option
but has not been considered by the Judge. The absence  of  consideration  of
internal relocation  weakens  the  overall  decision.  He  agreed  with  the
suggestion that this case should be remitted to the First-tier  to  consider
the question of internal relocation.

Analysis

8. Article 15  of  the  Qualification  Directive  defines  serious  harm  as
    follows:

      "Serious harm consists of:
      (a) death penalty or execution; or
      (b) torture or inhuman or degrading  treatment  or  punishment  of  an
    applicant in the country of origin; or
      (c) serious and individual threat to a civilian's life  or  person  by
    reason of indiscriminate violence in  situations  of  international  or
    internal armed conflict."

9. Paragraph 339CA of the Immigration Rules states:

    "...Serious harm consists of:
    (i) the death penalty or execution;
    (ii) unlawful killing;
    (iii) torture or inhuman or degrading  treatment  or  punishment  of  a
    person in the country of return; or
    (iv) serious and individual threat to a civilian's life  or  person  by
    reason of indiscriminate violence in  situations  of  international  or
    internal armed conflict."

10. In Elgafaji Case C-465/07 the  Court  held  that  the  harm  defined  in
Article 15 (c) covered a more general risk of harm than the harm defined  in
Articles 15 (a) and (b) (para 33).  The threat was not  simply  of  specific
acts of violence, but  more  generally  to  a  civilian's  life  or  person.
Describing the violence as indiscriminate implied  that  it  may  extend  to
people irrespective of their personal circumstances.  The word  "individual"
was to be understood as covering harm to  civilians  irrespective  of  their
identity where the degree  of  indiscriminate  violence  characterising  the
armed conflict taking place reached  such  a  high  level  that  substantial
grounds were shown for believing that a civilian, returned to  the  relevant
country or  region,  would,  solely  on  account  of  his  presence  on  the
territory, face a  real  risk  of  being  subject  to  the  serious  threat.
Recital 26 implied that a risk  linked  to  the  general  situation  in  the
country was not as a rule sufficient to establish that  the  conditions  set
out in Article 15 (c) had been met but it allowed for the possibility of  an
exceptional situation which would be characterised by such a high degree  of
risk that substantial grounds would be shown for believing that  the  person
would be subject individually to the risk in question.

11. The concept of a sliding scale  comes  from  Elgafaji  -  the  more  the
applicant is able to show that he is  specifically  affected  by  reason  of
factors particular to his personal circumstances, the  lower  the  level  of
indiscriminate violence required for  him  to  be  eligible  for  subsidiary
protection (para 39).  The nature of the inquiry was explained in MOJ &  Ors
Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 (at 32) as two-pronged in  that  (a)  it  asked
whether the level of violence was so high that  there  was  a  risk  to  all
civilians, (b) it asks that even if there is not such  a  general  risk,  is
there a specific risk based on the sliding-scale notion.  The  sliding-scale
approach recognised that a person might still be  accorded  protection  even
if the general level of violence is not very high if they are able  to  show
that there are specific reasons, over and above them being  mere  civilians,
for being affected by the indiscriminate violence.

12. The appellant's bundle contains a number of  background  materials.  The
appellant relied on


    (i)  Writenet/ UNHCR Ethiopia; a sociopolitical assessment, 01/05/2006
    (ii) US Department of state,  2016  country  reports  on  human  rights
        practices: Ethiopia. 03/03/2017
    (iii) International crisis group,  Ethiopia:  prospects  for  peace  in
        Ogaden, 06/08/2013
    (iv) Landinfo country of  origin  information  centre  (Norway),  query
        response: Ethiopia: the special police (Liyu Police) in the  Somali
        regional state 03/06/2016
    (v) Human Rights Watch, Ethiopia: no justice and Somali region killings
        05/04/2017


13. The background materials disclose

(a) Ogaden  is the unofficial name of the Somali  Region  of  Ethiopia,  the
territory comprising the eastern portion of Ethiopia.  The  inhabitants  are
predominantly ethnic Somali Muslims. In 2007, the Ethiopian Army launched  a
military crackdown in Ogaden after Ogaden rebels killed dozens  of  civilian
staff workers and guards at an Ethiopian oil field. The main rebel group  is
the Ogaden National Liberation Front under its Chairman  Mohamed  O.  Osman,
which is  fighting  against  the  Ethiopian  government.  Some  Somalis  who
inhabit Ogaden claim that Ethiopian military  kill  civilians,  destroy  the
livelihood of many of the ethnic  Somalis  and  commit  crimes  against  the
nomads in the region. However, testimony before the United States  House  of
Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs revealed massive brutality  and
killings  by  the  ONLF  rebels,  which  the  Ethiopian  government   labels
"terrorists."

(b)  The extent of the conflict in Ogaden is difficult to gauge  because  of
a  media  blockade  in  the  Ogaden  region.   Some   international   rights
organizations have accused the Ethiopian regime  of  committing  abuses  and
crimes that "violate laws of war," as a recent report by  the  Human  Rights
Watch indicates. Other  reports  have  claimed  that  Ethiopia  has  bombed,
killed, and raped many Somalis  in  the  Ogaden  region,  while  the  United
States continues to arm Ethiopia  in  the  United  States'  ongoing  War  on
Terror in the Horn of Africa.

(c) The Ogaden  National  Liberation  Front  is  a  separatist  rebel  group
fighting for the right to  self-determination  for  Somalis  in  the  Somali
Region of Ethiopia. The ONLF, established in 1984, demands the  autonomy  of
this region and has claimed responsibility for  several  attacks  since  the
beginning of  1994  aimed  at  Ethiopian  forces  in  the  area,  which  the
government considers a region under the new federal system. The area of  the
Ogaden region stretches at least about 330,000  square  kilometres  and  has
over 7 million people, mainly from the Absame Somali tribe. The ONLF  claims
that  Ethiopia  is  an  occupying  government,  despite  the  Ogaden   being
represented in the Ethiopian federal  government  by  groups  including  the
opposition Somali People's Democratic Party (SPDP).

14. In Diakit� v Commissaire g�n�ral aux r�fugi�s et aux apatrides (Case  C-
285/12) CJEU (Fourth Chamber), it was held that on a proper construction  of
Article 15(c) of Directive 2004/83/EC, an internal armed  conflict  existed,
for the purposes of applying that  provision,  if  a  State's  armed  forces
confronted one or  more  armed  groups  or  if  two  or  more  armed  groups
confronted each other.  It  was  not  necessary  for  that  conflict  to  be
categorised as 'armed conflict not  of  an  international  character'  under
international humanitarian  law;  nor  was  it  necessary  to  carry  out  a
separate assessment of the intensity of the armed  confrontations  in  order
to establish whether the condition relating to armed conflict had been  met.
 The finding that there was an armed conflict  was  not  to  be  conditional
upon the armed forces involved having a certain  level  of  organisation  or
upon the conflict lasting for a specific length of time.

15.  [29] and [30] of the decision makes it clear that the Judge  considered
the background materials. The Judge's findings at [29] are manifestly  drawn
from the background materials. At [30] of the decision  the  Judge  compares
the situation described in the background materials with areas of  Iraq,  in
which it has been judicially determined that  there  is  an  internal  armed
conflict which engages  article  15(c)  because  of  the  risk  to  ordinary
civilians. The Judge takes a geographical area in which there is  a  clearly
defined article 15(c) risk, he compares the risk there to the risks he  sets
out in [29] of the decision and finds that the  level  of  violence  in  the
appellant's home area does not meet the article 15(c) threshold.

16. The Judge's finding  at  [30]  is  a  finding  which  is  reached  after
considering the background materials in detail. There is no tension  between
[29] &  [30]  of  the  decision.  The  Judge  makes  a  clear  finding  that
notwithstanding the atrocities committed by  the  Liyu  police  against  the
Ogaden people, and the increased risk that the appellant  faces  as  a  lone
female, for the reasons given at [30] the level of violence does  not  cross
the article 15(c) threshold. That is a finding  which  is  well  within  the
range of reasonable conclusions available to the Judge.

17. Having found that article 15(c) of the qualification  directive  is  not
engaged, there was no need for the Judge to  consider  internal  relocation.
Internal relocation would require to be considered if the Judge  found  that
the appellant was entitled to humanitarian protection in the Ogaden  region.
Because the Judge found that the article 15(c)  threshold  is  not  crossed,
internal relocation does not require consideration.

18.  Having taken correct guidance in law and made findings  of  fact  which
are not   challenged,  the  Judge  reached  his  conclusion.  It  is  not  a
conclusion that the appellant  likes  but  it  is  a  conclusion  which  was
reasonably open to the Judge on the facts as he found them to be.

19. In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85  (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that (i) Although there is  a  legal  duty  to  give  a  brief
explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on which  an  appeal  is
determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole
makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted  by  the  judge;  (ii)
Although a decision may contain an error of law where  the  requirements  to
give adequate reasons are not met, the Upper  Tribunal  would  not  normally
set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  where  there  has  been  no
misdirection of law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised  and  the
relevant  Country  Guidance  has  been  taken  into  account,   unless   the
conclusions the judge draws from the primary data were not  reasonably  open
to him or her.

20. There is nothing  wrong  with  the  Judge's  fact-finding  exercise.  In
reality the appellant's appeal amounts to little more  than  a  disagreement
with the way the Judge has applied the facts as he found  them  to  be.  The
appellant might not like the conclusion that the  Judge  has  come  to,  but
that conclusion is the result of the correctly applied legal  equation.  The
correct test in law has been  applied.  The  decision  does  not  contain  a
material error of law.

21.   The Judge's decision, when read as a whole,  sets  out  findings  that
are sustainable and sufficiently detailed.

22.   No errors of law have been established. The Judge's decision stands.

DECISION

23.   The appeal is dismissed. The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
promulgated on 18 May 2017, stands.
