Representation:
Appellant   Mr Alluwalia, Counsel, instructed by Visa Inn
Respondent  Mr Bramble (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Pakistan. The appellants are related  in
    that the first two-named appellants are husband and wife and the third-
    named appellant is their child. The first-named appellant  was  granted
    leave to enter the United Kingdom as a student  on  February  19,  2008
    with leave to remain until July 31, 2009.  His leave was extended as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Migrant until August 30, 2012. He was  served  with  a
    curtailment notice but was then granted leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Post study) Migrant until September 5, 2014. The appellants applied to
    remain as  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  and  dependants  but  the
    respondent refused these applications on November 4, 2014.

 2. The appellants appealed those decisions  under  section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on November 12, 2014.

 3.  The  appeal  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Watt
    (hereinafter referred to as the  Judge)  on  July  6,  2015  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on July 27, 2015 he refused the appellant's appeal
    finding  the  documents  did  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of   the
    Immigration Rules and in particular paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv) of  Appendix
    A of the Immigration Rules.

 4. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on August  7,  2015  submitting
    the First-tier Judge had erred.

 5. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Heynes refused permission  to  appeal.
    The appellants renewed their grounds of appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    and Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun gave permission firstly,  on  the  basis
    there was an arguable error in law in the way the Judge had  approached
    the documents and secondly, by failing to consider article 8.

 6. In a Rule 24 letter dated December 22, 2015 the respondent opposed  the
    appeal.

 7. The matter came before me on the above date  and  I  heard  submissions
    from both representatives. Mr Bramble conceded that the Judge's failure
    to deal with an article 8 claim, that was  highlighted  in  a  detailed
    skeleton argument, would amount to an error but he continued to dispute
    the error alleged under the Rules.

 8. I indicated that if there was an error in law in the  Judge's  approach
    to the Immigration Rules then I would remake the decision in the  Upper
    Tribunal. However, if that decision was in order then I would remit the
    matter back to the Judge to deal with article 8 issues.

 9. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make no order.

    SUBMISSIONS

10. Mr Alluwalia submitted a third skeleton  argument  on  the  basis  this
    helpfully set out his arguments.  In  short,  he  submitted  the  Judge
    accepted the appellant satisfied paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii) of Appendix  A
    of the Immigration Rules and the issue was whether subsection (iv)  was
    met. He argued the documents identified in paragraphs [26] and [27]  of
    his skeleton argument demonstrated the appellant had set up a business.
    The bank statements demonstrated over a twelve-month period  that  this
    was an active business. He submitted the Judge  had  erred  in  how  he
    approached the issue of a service contract in  paragraph  [34]  of  his
    decision. He had  failed  to  have  regard  to  all  of  the  documents
    including the items he had highlighted. Following the decision of Shebl
    (Entrepreneur: proof of contracts) [2014] UKUT 00126 it was clear  that
    in considering whether there was a contract the decision  maker  should
    have regard to all of the documents.

11. Mr Bramble relied on the  Rule  24  response  and  submitted  that  the
    appellant had provided evidence of setting up a business but he had not
    provided evidence of who he was doing business  with.  Subsection  (iv)
    required this and the Judge had been entitled to refuse his appeal.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

12. This was an appeal that ultimately fell to be decided  on  whether  the
    first-named appellant satisfied paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)  and  (iv)  of
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

13. Mr Bramble  accepted  the  Judge  had  concluded  the  requirements  of
    subsection (iii) had been met  and  the  only  issue  remaining  to  be
    decided was whether the Judge's  approach  to  the  evidence  and  more
    particularly subsection (iv) displayed an error in law.

14. There was no dispute between the parties that  the  appellant  had  the
    building blocks of a business. In an  analogy  Mr  Alluwalia  described
    this aspect of the business as being akin to  a  shopkeeper  renting  a
    shop, buying in products and placing those  products  on  the  shelves.
    Continuing this analogy both representatives agreed that to satisfy the
    Rules the appellant had to  then  demonstrate  he  had  customers.  The
    difference in approach was that Mr Bramble submitted the appellant  had
    to show who his customer was as this was a requirement of paragraph 41-
    SD(e)(iv).

15. I accept Mr Alluwalia's submission  that  in  considering  whether  the
    appellant satisfied subsection (iv) of  paragraph  41-SD(e)  the  Judge
    should not merely have looked at  the  contract  but  should  have  had
    regard to all of the documents submitted with the application  as  this
    was a points based application.

16. Mr Alluwalia agreed with me at the hearing that if  the  appellant  had
    submitted invoices,  with  his  application,  showing  details  of  his
    customers then the Rules would have been met and his application  would
    probably have been granted without an appeal process.

17. His submission is that the bank statements are the evidence  needed  to
    satisfy paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv).

18. Paragraph 41-SD provides details of what an applicant  has  to  submit.
    They are mandatory requirements and a failure to  submit  the  required
    documents leads to  the  situation  that  appellants  often  face.  The
    wording of Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv) is important as this section placed a
    requirement on the appellant to submit certain evidence.

19.  Mr  Alluwalia's  submission  that  the  bank  statements  meets   this
    requirement overlooks  the  fact  that  the  Rules  require,  for  this
    particular  type  of  application,  the  naming  of  persons  you   are
    servicing. The appellant was not operating a  sweet  shop  as  per  the
    above analogy. He would not come within the Tier 1 provisions  in  that
    case.

20. The bank statements do not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-
    SD(e)(iv). Although those payments demonstrate cash flow  they  do  not
    demonstrate compliance with that part of the Rules.  If  the  appellant
    merely had to show cash flow the appellant  would  have  satisfied  the
    Rules but this is not what is required.

21. Having carefully considered all of the  evidence  I  am  not  persuaded
    there was a material error in the Judge's approach to  the  Immigration
    Rules. Whilst the Judge did not demonstrate full consideration  of  the
    documents the fact remains there was no evidence to  satisfy  what  was
    necessary under subsection (iv) and in those circumstances there can be
    no material error.

22. However, Mr Bramble had already has conceded there was  an  error  with
    regard to article 8 ECHR and section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and
    Immigration Act 2009 because the Judge had failed to  deal  with  these
    issues despite the matter being raised in the  skeleton  arguments  and
    IAFT1.

23. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

         "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
         Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
         Tribunal finds that the making of the decision  concerned  involved
         the making of an error on a point of law, the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         set aside the decision and, if it does so, must  either  remit  the
         case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  or
         proceed (in accordance with relevant Practice  Directions)  to  re-
         make the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).

         The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
         make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that :ï¿½

          a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

          b) the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."

24. Both parties agreed that the matter be remitted back to the  First-tier
    for a decision to be taken on those matters.

25. I raised with both representatives whether there was any reason why the
    matter should not be remitted back to the original  Judge  to  complete
    the job he had started bearing in mind he had already heard  the  facts
    of the case. Both agreed the matter could be remitted back to the  same
    Judge and I therefore in remitting the matter back I  direct  that,  if
    possible, the matter be listed before Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Watt. If he is no longer sitting in this jurisdiction or is unavailable
    then the matter can listed before any Judge.

    DECISION

26. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law in that no article 8 or section 55
    of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009  decision  was
    taken.

27. The appeal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for these issues
    to  be  addressed  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

28. I uphold the decision  dismissing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.
