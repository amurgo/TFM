                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge ("DUTJ") Storey granted  the  Secretary  of
    State permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against a decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hussain (hereafter the  "judge")  who,
    in a decision promulgated on 20 May 2016, allowed the appeal of Ms Kaur
    (hereafter the "claimant") against a decision of the Secretary of State
    of 9 June 2015 to refuse her application of 2 May 2014 for variation of
    her leave and to remove her from the United Kingdom.

 2. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, there was no appearance by or
    on behalf of the claimant at 10.00 am, when the appeal was  listed  for
    hearing, nor by 1.00 pm. On 3 January 2017, the Upper Tribunal received
    by facsimile a letter of the same date from Maalik &  Co  Solicitors  &
    Advocates, the claimant's representatives, stating that they would  not
    be attending the hearing because they were without instructions.

 3. Maalik & Co Solicitors & Advocates were on  record  as  the  claimant's
    duly appointed representatives as at the date of the Notice of  Hearing
    which was sent to Maalik & Co Solicitors & Advocates. I  was  therefore
    satisfied that the Notice of Hearing dated 8  December  2016  had  been
    duly served on  the  claimant  notwithstanding  the  letter  from  them
    stating that they were without instructions. It was the claimant's duty
    to keep in touch with her  representatives.  If  she  had  changed  her
    representatives or had decided to withdraw instructions from  them,  it
    was her responsibility to inform the Upper Tribunal. She failed  to  do
    so.

 4. I had no reason to think that, if the hearing were to be adjourned, the
    claimant might attend the hearing. I took into account  the  overriding
    interest.

 5. In all of the circumstances, I decided to exercise  my  discretion  and
    proceed with the hearing.

 6. I heard briefly from Mr Jarvis.

The Secretary of State's reasons for refusal

 7. The Secretary of State refused the claimant's application  for  reasons
    which may be summarised as follows:

    i)      the Secretary of State considered that the claimant had made  a
        false representation and therefore refused  her  application  under
        para 322(1A) of the Rules;

      ii)   the Secretary of State considered that she had worked in  breach
        of the conditions of her stay and therefore refused her application
        under para 322(3) of the Rules; and

      iii)  the Secretary of State considered that the claimant submitted  a
        "Confirmation of studies" ("CAS") certificate that  was  not  valid
        because the sponsor was not  named  on  the  register  of  licensed
        sponsors as at the date of the decision.

Judge Hussain's decision

 8. The claimant did not attend the hearing before Judge Hussain.

 9. Judge Hussain considered that the Secretary of State had  not  produced
    any evidence to demonstrate that  the  claimant  had  dishonestly  made
    representations that were false. He said that he  could  not  find  any
    evidence of such false representations, nor was there any evidence that
    the claimant had worked in breach of her conditions of stay.

10. In relation to the substantive application for leave to  remain,  Judge
    Hussain noted that the claimant had  provided  a  valid  CAS  with  her
    application for leave. He allowed her appeal because he considered that
    the Secretary of State had failed to follow her policy of  granting  60
    days' leave to an individual whose sponsor had had its licence  revoked
    in the  period  during  which  the  application  for  leave  was  being
    considered. Although the judge did not refer to  the  decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal in Patel (revocation  of  sponsor  licence  -  fairness)
    India [2011] UKUT 00211 (IAC) in terms, it is clear that he relied upon
    the principle in that case in allowing the appeal.

11. The judge therefore allowed the appeal  under  the  Rules  and  on  the
    ground that  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.

The grant of permission

12. DUTJ Storey considered that it was not open to the judge to  allow  the
    appeal on the ground that the decision was not in accordance  with  the
    law. He was of the view that this ground of appeal was not available to
    the claimant following the  amendments  to  s.84  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 by the Immigration Act 2014.

13. In addition, DUTJ Storey was of the view that the judge  was  wrong  to
    find that there was no evidence before him that the claimant  had  made
    false  representations  or  that  she  had  worked  in  breach  of  her
    conditions of stay. This was because the two refusal  letters  "were  a
    type of evidence" and the judge was arguably wrong to  say  that  there
    was not "any evidence" of the allegations.

Assessment

14. I agree with Mr Jarvis that the claimant did have available to her  the
    ground of appeal that the decision was not in accordance with the  law.
    This is because she made her application for leave to remain on  2  May
    2014 and that application was outstanding as at 6 April 2015 when  s.84
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 was amended by  the
    Immigration Act 2014. Her case therefore came within the provisions  of
    article 8 of the Immigration Act 2014 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional
    and Savings Provisions and Amendment) Order 2015 (SI 2015 No. 371).

15. However, I have decided that Judge Hussain materially erred in law  for
    the following reasons:

16. Firstly, the judge overlooked relevant evidence when he said  that  the
    Secretary of State had not produced evidence that the claimant had made
    a false representation and  that  she  had  worked  in  breach  of  her
    conditions of stay. In relation to former,  the  claimant  had  made  a
    statement at J16 of her application for leave of 2 May  2014  that  she
    had never been refused leave to enter or remain, whereas  the  decision
    letter stated that  she  had  had  a  previous  application  for  entry
    clearance (made on 27 March 2008) refused and her  appeal  against  the
    refusal dismissed and a further application for entry  clearance  of  6
    August 2009 refused. In relation to the  latter,  the  decision  letter
    states that the claimant had  been  paid  wages  totalling  �6,797  (in
    respect of which tax of �227.80 was paid) for the tax year 2013-2014.

17. In her grounds of appeal, the claimant did not dispute the accuracy  of
    the information in the decision letter. Her case was that the Secretary
    of State should have known about the previous refused applications  and
    that she had worked in breach and that accordingly, she  had  not  made
    any false representations or  worked  in  breach.  The  fact  that  the
    claimant had not disputed  the  factual  information  in  the  decision
    letter was some evidence before the judge.

18. I am therefore satisfied that the judge erred  in  law  in  overlooking
    relevant evidence or material in reaching his decision on paras 322(1A)
    and paragraph 322(3) of the Rules.

19. The judge's decision to allow the appeal on the basis of  the  decision
    in Patel cannot stand. In Patel, the application  failed  only  because
    the sponsor's licence had been revoked unknown to the applicant.  There
    were no other reasons why the application failed.  Given  that  I  have
    concluded that the judge erred in law reaching his  decision  that  the
    Secretary of State had not discharged the burden of proof upon  her  to
    show that the claimant had made false  representations  and  worked  in
    breach, his decision to  allow  the  appeal  on  the  ground  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law because  the  Secretary  of
    State had failed to follow her policy of granting 60 days' leave cannot
    stand.

20. I therefore set aside the decision of Judge Hussain in its entirety.  I
    proceed to re-make the decision on the claimant's  appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision.

21. The burden of proof is upon the Secretary  of  State  to  show  to  the
    standard of the balance of probabilities that the claimant had  made  a
    false representation and acted dishonestly in doing so. The  burden  of
    proof is upon the Secretary of State to show to  the  standard  of  the
    balance of probabilities that the claimant had worked in breach of  the
    conditions of her stay.

22. The decision letter states that the claimant was paid  wages  totalling
    �6,797 (in respect of which tax of �227.80 was paid) for the  tax  year
    2013-2014. In her grounds of appeal, the fact that the claimant did not
    dispute that she was paid wages totalling �6,797 is evidence  that  she
    did work in breach of the conditions of her stay.  In  her  application
    for leave (at J16), she said she  had  not  worked  in  breach  of  the
    conditions of her stay.  I  infer  that  she  knowingly  denied  having
    worked in breach and that she did so dishonestly.

23. Likewise, at J18 of her application, the claimant said that she had not
    been refused entry clearance or leave to enter or remain in the  United
    Kingdom. However, her grounds  of  appeal  did  not  dispute  that  her
    previous applications of 27 March 2008 and of 27 July  2009  for  entry
    clearance were refused and that her appeal against  the  first  refusal
    was dismissed. Her case was that, as the Secretary of State should have
    known about her previous applications,  she  did  not  make  any  false
    representations. This argument is simply  untenable  which  I  have  no
    hesitation in rejecting. The onus was  upon  her  to  ensure  that  her
    answer was accurate, not rely upon the Secretary of State to check  her
    records.

24. I further infer that the claimant's reliance  upon  such  an  untenable
    argument is evidence that she has no proper explanation to give or none
    that would stand up to  any  scrutiny.  This  is  further  evidence  of
    dishonesty.

25. In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Secretary of State
    has  shown  that  the  claimant  was  dishonest  in  making  the  false
    representations at J16 and J18. I am also satisfied that the  Secretary
    of State has shown that the  claimant  had  worked  in  breach  of  the
    conditions of her stay.

26. In relation to the refusal under para 322(3), I have considered whether
    the discretion should be exercised in the claimant's favour. I  see  no
    reasons why it should. I therefore refuse to exercise the discretion in
    the claimant's favour.

27. Accordingly, I dismiss the claimant's appeals under  para  322(1A)  and
    para 322(3) of the Rules.

28. In relation to the  substantive  appeal  against  the  application  for
    leave, the Upper Tribunal's decision in Patel is not applicable.  Given
    that I have decided the para 322(1A) and para 322(3) issues against the
    claimant, it is not the case that the only reason  why  the  claimant's
    application or appeal fails is that she  submitted  a  CAS  certificate
    which was invalid by  reason  of  the  sponsor's  licence  having  been
    revoked in the period between the submission of the application and the
    date of the decision.

29. I therefore dismiss the claimant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision on all grounds.

      Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law such that it falls to be set aside. I have  set
    it aside in its entirety. I have proceeded to re-make the  decision  on
    the claimant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's  decision.  My
    decision is that her appeal is dismissed under  the  Immigration  Rules
    and on the ground that the decision is not in accordance with the law.
