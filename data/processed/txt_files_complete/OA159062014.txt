For the Respondent:          Ms Johnstone,  Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Turkey born on  the  2nd  January  1993.
    She appeals with permission the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Dhaliwal) to dismiss her appeal against a decision to refuse  to
    grant her entry clearance as a spouse.





 2.  When  the  Appellant  applied  for  entry  clearance  the   Respondent
    considered the  application  with  reference  to  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  So too did the First-tier  Tribunal.  The  Tribunal
    accepted that the Appellant's was a genuine  and  subsisting  marriage,
    but the appeal fell to be dismissed because she had  not  produced  the
    mandatory documents as to maintenance set out in Appendix FM-SE.


 3. The matter in issue in this appeal is whether the  Appellant  needs  to
    show that she can meet the requirements of Appendix FM at  all.  It  is
    her case that she can benefit from the provisions of various agreements
    reached between the UK and Turkish governments, including the 1963 EEA-
    Turkey Association Agreement (the Ankara Agreement)  and  its  relevant
    protocols.   She argues that the composite effect of  these  agreements
    are that as a family member of a  Turkish  national  exercising  treaty
    rights she is entitled to join her husband.   Once she is in the UK she
    would be eligible to apply  for  public  funds.  Although  she  has  no
    intention of so doing, so submits that this legal fact means  that  she
    cannot logically be refused entry clearance on maintenance grounds.  In
    her application form she expressly  relied  on  published  Home  Office
    policy:

         "Home  Office  Entry  Clearance   Guidance   on   maintenance   and
         accommodation confirms that in entry clearance applications Turkish
         nationals  are  exempt  from  maintenance   requirements   due   to
         Agreements signed by Turkey and Europe and the UK".

 4. In this appeal the Appellant maintains that the Respondent, and  First-
    tier Tribunal, erred in confining considering of her application within
    the paradigm of the Rules. It is submitted  that  properly  understood,
    her  case  fell  to  be  considered  with  reference  to  international
    agreements and to the Home Office policy.  Permission  was  granted  on
    this ground by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker.

    The Facts


 5. The accepted facts are that the Appellant has, since 2013, been married
    to a Mr Gokay Iseri.  He is a citizen of both  Turkey  and  the  United
    Kingdom.   He is self  employed,  running  a  take-away  restaurant  in
    Chorley. He earns approximately ï¿½20,000 per year. The  Appellant  is  a
    Turkish national.

      Legal Framework and Discussion

 6. The Appellant relies on two documents extracted from  the  Respondent's
    published policies (Immigration Directorates' Instructions-  modernised
    guidance).  The  first  is   a   document   headed   'maintenance   and
    accommodation - entry clearance guidance'. This reminds case-owners  of
    the basic premise that applicants for entry clearance need to  be  able
    to demonstrate that they will be  maintained  in  accordance  with  the
    requirements in the Immigration Rules. Having done so it cautions:

         "Bear in mind that in some exceptional cases an  applicant  may  be
         able to claim in their own right the public funds listed.  This  is
         either as a result of reciprocal arrangements between  the  UK  and
         their home country, or as a result of the fact that  they  will  be
         married to/living with a British citizen/EEA national. Where  these
         exceptional  circumstances  apply,  the  applicant  should  not  be
         treated as having recourse to public funds".


 7. The second extract from the IDI is headed 'Public Funds'. This confirms
    that  applications  by  Turkish  nationals  must   be   considered   as
    'exceptions' since Turkish nationals are entitled to claim a wide range
    of benefits in the UK, including child benefit, housing  benefit,  job-
    seekers allowance and working tax credit.


 8. In addition to the Ankara Agreement and its protocols these rights  for
    a Turkish national to claim public funds in the UK derive from Turkey's
    ratification of the European Social Charter on the 24th  November  1989
    and the European Convention on Social and Medical Assistance on the 2nd
    December 1976. Both of these Conventions are acts  of  the  Council  of
    Europe and they therefore supercede UK domestic law.

 9. The Respondent submits that the policy set out above has no application
    in this case because the Appellant  is  not  applying  in-country,  and
    because her husband is now British.

10. The first submission is difficult to understand given that  the  policy
    in question is sub-headed 'entry clearance guidance'.  In  response  to
    the latter the Appellant relies upon the Opinion  of  Advocate  General
    Sharpston in Tayfun Kahveci (C-7/10),  handed  down  in  the  Court  of
    Justice on the 20th October 2011. In that decision the CJEU  was  asked
    to deliver a preliminary ruling on  whether  the  naturalisation  of  a
    worker in a host member state should  deprive  his  family  members  of
    rights that would otherwise have flowed from Article 7  of  the  Ankara
    Agreement.  In that case the AG considered the position of two  Turkish
    men, both of whom were facing removal from the Netherlands  because  of
    their criminal convictions.   One resisted such action on  the  grounds
    that he was married to  a  Turkish  woman  who  was  exercising  treaty
    rights; the other on the grounds that he was the family member  of  his
    father, who was doing the same. In both cases the  Sponsor  had  gained
    Dutch nationality whilst at the same time retaining his or her  Turkish
    citizenship. The AG's opinion was as follows:

              i) Article 7 of the Ankara Agreement must be construed  so  as
                 to give effect to the aim of the progressive achievement of
                 the free movement of workers [43]


             ii) That objective is achieved  inter  alia  by  providing  for
                 Turkish family members to join the worker in the host state
                 to enable the family to be together [50];

            iii) The integration of  the  family  into  the  host  state  is
                 facilitated by giving family members a right to work within
                 a specified time frame [52];

             iv) The worker does not surrender his rights under Article 7 by
                 acquiring the nationality of his host  country  if  he  has
                 also retained his Turkish nationality [54-55];

              v) Nor, it must follow, do members of his family [82]

             vi) To hold otherwise would run wholly contrary to the aims  of
                 free movement and integration [56]


11. I am satisfied that the clear terms of the Respondent's policy are that
    Turkish nationals applying for entry clearance in  these  circumstances
    should not have to meet the maintenance requirements of the Immigration
    Rules.   That  policy  is  based  on   the   reciprocal   international
    commitments arising not only from the Ankara  Agreement  but  from  the
    Council of Europe Conventions mentioned above. It  is  clear  from  the
    persuasive opinion of  AG  Sharpston  that  these  benefits  accrue  to
    families even where the sponsor had acquired  the  nationality  of  the
    host nation.


12. I find that the First-tier Tribunal has therefore erred in law and  the
    decision is set aside. I allow the  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    decision is not in accordance with the law.

    Decisions

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


14. The appeal is allowed

15. I was  not  asked  to  make  a  direction  for  anonymity  and  in  the
    circumstances I see no reason to do so.
