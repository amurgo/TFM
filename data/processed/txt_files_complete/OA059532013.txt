Representation:

 Appellant:   Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
 Respondent:  Unrepresented



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  This appeal has its origins in a decision made by the Entry  Clearance
    Officer (Istanbul), the Appellant  herein,  dated  5th  February  2013,
    whereby the Respondent's application for clearance to enter the  United
    Kingdom as the partner of Clare Karaalp (hereinafter "the sponsor") was
    refused.  The refusal was based on two  grounds.   The  first  was  the
    Respondent's  failure  to  demonstrate   a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship with  the  sponsor  and  an  intention  to  live  together
    permanently.  The second was the Respondent's failure  to  satisfy  the
    requirement of a minimum income of �18,600.  The  application,  at  its
    zenith, demonstrated that the sponsor has  an  income  of  �17,160  per
    annum.   The  first  of  these  grounds  of   refusal   was   withdrawn
    subsequently in a review decision by the Entry Clearance Manager, dated
    18th July 2013.  The second ground of refusal was upheld.  With  effect
    from 9th July 2012, the minimum income threshold for a partner applying
    under Appendix FM has been �18,600.

 2. The sponsor's appeal to the FtT was determined  as  a  paper  exercise.
    The Judge  upheld  the  Appellant's  decision  on  the  basis  of  non-
    compliance with the financial requirement, stating in [8]:

         "Although the Appellant satisfied all of the other requirements  of
         Appendix FM it follows that the appeal must be dismissed under  the
         Immigration Rules."

    The Judge then turned to consider the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.  His
    conclusion was, in terms, that  the  impugned  decision  represented  a
    disproportionate interference with the right to respect for family life
    enjoyed by the Respondent and the sponsor, his spouse.  The essence  of
    the Judge's reasoning was that the extent of the failure to satisfy the
    financial requirement of the Rules was of narrow dimensions.

 3. At the initial hearing conducted on 14 April 2014.  I   considered  the
    terms in which permission to appeal had been granted, together with the
    representations made to this Tribunal by the sponsor, who attended  and
    was unrepresented.  Mrs Karaalp stated that she is a  British  citizen,
    the relationship is of eight years duration,  they  have  been  married
    since October 2008 and she travels to Turkey to visit the Respondent at
    intervals of approximately three months.  They now have a  child,  aged
    five months.  Mrs Karaalp also drew attention to  her  income  and  the
    support available from her family, which will include, in the future, a
    one third share of her father's estate in the event of his demise. None
    of this was in dispute.

 4. At the conclusion of the initial hearing, I gave judgment to the effect
    that there are two clear errors of law in the determination of the FtT.
     The first is that the Judge had, in substance,  recognised  and  given
    effect to the discredited  "near  miss"  principle:  see  Miah  -  v  -
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012]  EWCA  Civ  261.   As
    stated by Stanley Burnton LJ, the potency of  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining firm and effective immigration control is  not  diluted  in
    cases where  the  failure  of  the  person  concerned  to  satisfy  the
    requirements prescribed by the Rules is a narrow one.  The second error
    of law is that the Judge failed to conduct an adequate  proportionality
    assessment.  There was no identification of the public interest in play
    and  no  consideration  was  given   to   the   governing   principles.
    Furthermore the Judge did not conduct the  necessary  scrutiny  of  the
    history and reality of the relationship between the Respondent and  the
    sponsor.  The proportionality assessment was further  infected  by  the
    intrusion of the immaterial consideration that if  the  sponsor's  case
    had come within  one  of  the  specified  exceptions  the  Respondent's
    application  would  have  satisfied  the  Rules.   I   considered   the
    materiality of these errors of law to be unmistakable.


 5.  Thus I ruled that the decision of the FtT be set aside, to  be  remade
    in this forum.

 6. At the further hearing conducted on  12  April  2014,  the  Appellant's
    sponsor, Mrs Karaalp (his spouse), was, once again, unrepresented.  She
    made a brief, but focused, submission  the  chief  ingredients  whereof
    were  fairness,  proportionality  and  hardship.   On  behalf  of   the
    Secretary of State, it was submitted that this appeal can succeed  only
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds and only  if  it  is  demonstrated  that  the
    impugned decision  interferes  disproportionately  with  the  right  to
    respect for family life enjoyed by the  members of the unit  concerned.
    It was further submitted that the birth of their child,  now  aged  six
    months, cannot be taken into account in  determining  this  appeal.   I
    concur with each of these submissions.


 7. As on  the  last  occasion,  Mrs  Karaalp,  once  again,  made  a  most
    favourable impression in her presentation to the Tribunal.  She did not
    fabricate or overstate anything.  In considering whether  the  impugned
    decision  is  disproportionate,  I  take  into  account  the  following
    factors. It is abundantly clear that Mrs Karaalp and  her  parents  are
    responsible, upstanding, self-sufficient members of the community.  Mrs
    Karaalp has secure employment with favourable prospects of advancement.
     This will continue  indefinitely.   She  lives  independently  of  her
    parents in a fully  furnished  privately  rented  flat.   The  parental
    support is  substantial  .   Given  her  security  of  employment,  her
    lifelong ties with  this  country  and  the  factors  of  upheaval  and
    uncertainty, particularly relating  to  the  availability  of  adequate
    alternative employment, I accept Mrs Karaalp's reasons  for  preferring
    to continue to live in Northern  Ireland,  albeit  separated  from  her
    Turkish husband.  I further find, based on the evidence given, that  if
    were to reside in Northern Ireland he would have  favourable  prospects
    of securing employment here.

 8. As a consequence of the impugned  decision  this  married  couple  will
    continue to be separated by thousands of miles.  The interference  with
    their right to respect for family life is both profound and  acute.  It
    is a credit to both that their  relationship  has  survived  since  its
    initiation, eight years  ago.  While it endures, it does so in the most
    unsatisfactory  of  circumstances  in  which  family  life   has   been
    significantly  impaired  and  reduced  for  both.    This  devoted  and
    responsible couple find themselves in a truly wretched situation, which
    is more likely than  not  to  endure  indefinitely.   Finally,  in  the
    assessment of proportionality, I take into account that the failure  to
    satisfy the minimum income  threshold  prescribed  by  the  Immigration
    Rules was of modest dimensions (�18,00 - v -  �17,160).   I  also  take
    into account that this is plainly  a  genuine,  subsisting  and  loving
    relationship.

 9. While I recognise the legitimate aims in play, namely  the  maintenance
    of firm immigration control and the promotion of the economic wellbeing
    of the country, the latter is plainly diluted to a  significant  extent
    in this particular factual matrix.   Cases  of  the  present  kind  are
    usually of  the  borderline  variety  and  the  present  appeal  is  no
    exception  in  this  respect.  The  Court  is  the  final  arbiter   of
    proportionality.  Given the findings and factors highlighted  above,  I
    conclude that the  impugned  decision  constitutes  a  disproportionate
    interference with the right to respect for family life enjoyed by  this
    married couple.


DECISION

10. Accordingly, I remake the  first  instance  decision  by  allowing  the
    appeal under Article 8 ECHR.  It follows that the decision of  the  ECO
    will have to be remade in terms reflecting this  judgment,  subject  to
    any admissible novel facts or considerations.
