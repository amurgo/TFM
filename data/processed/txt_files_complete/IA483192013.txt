Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms M Singh, instructed by Howells, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwncyz, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Furong Huang, was born on 29  October  1990  and  is  a
    citizen of China.  I shall hereafter refer to  the  respondent  as  the
    appellant and to the Secretary of State as the respondent, as they were
    respectively before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant applied for further leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student but her application  was  refused  on  25
    October 2013.  She appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Agnew),
    which, in a determination promulgated on 25  March  2014,  allowed  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds (Article
    8 ECHR).  The Secretary of State now appeals  with  permission  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 3. At [5], Judge Agnew noted

         The reasons for the refusal  of  the  appellant's  application  are
         noted in the respondent's letter dated 25  October  2013.   It  was
         noted that the appellant needed to show maintenance funds and  that
         she was in possession of �1,957.00 for 28 days from 30 August  2013
         to 26 September 2013.  However, on the bank statements submitted, a
         balance  of  �1,022.48  was  shown  on  10  September  2013.    The
         application was refused on that basis.

 4. The judge went on to consider the cases of Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ  2
    and Alam [2012] EWCA Civ 960 and, in addition,  the  Immigration  Rules
    now incorporating the  respondent's  "evidential  flexibility  policy."
    The application pre-dated a  change  in  the  Rules  but  the  decision
    postdated that change and it  is  agreed  that  the  relevant  Rule  is
    paragraph 245AA(b):

         (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

          (i) Some of the documents in a sequence  have  been  omitted  (for
         example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);

         (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is
         not on letterhead paper as specified); or

          (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or

          (iv) A document does not contain all of the specified information;






          a) the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Immigration  Officer  or  the
             Secretary  of  State  may  contact  the   applicant   or   his
             representative in writing, and request the correct  documents.
             The requested  documents  must  be  received  at  the  address
             specified in the request within 7 working days of the date  of
             the request.




The appellant had submitted a number of bank  statements  for  the  relevant
period from HSBC.  Several of these statements record substantial  transfers
of money into the account  described  as  "INTERNET  TRANSFER"  bearing  the
reference  400300  80850810.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that   this
reference is that of another bank account held by the  appellant  (the  sort
code is the same as that shown on the statements which have been  disclosed)
and on that basis the judge went on at [11] to find as follows:

  Ms Brewer  [the  Presenting  Officer]  submitted  that  the  respondent's
  representatives could not  know  that  the  appellant  had  another  bank
  account and the transfers into her current account were coming  from  the
  appellant's savings account.  They were not to know anything was missing.
   However,  given  the  regular  transfers  into  her  bank  account,  the
  appellant's history of studying and her circumstances,  I  find  that  if
  considered carefully or substantively,  the  representative  should  have
  realised that something was missing and checked with the appellant.   The
  appellant's savings account, held  in  the  same  bank,  showed  a  large
  balance during the relevant period.  As there was  no  other  reason  for
  refusing  the  appellant's  application  I  find  that  the  respondent's
  representative should in the particular circumstances of  this  appellant
  [have] checked with her to see if any bank statements were missing and on
  provision of her savings account (not lodged in  error)  the  application
  would have been allowed.

 5. Miss Singh, for the  appellant,  submitted  that  the  judge  had  been
    correct for two reasons.  First, as she  notes  at  [11]  there  was  a
    failure on the part of the Secretary of State substantively to  analyse
    the evidence which the appellant had submitted.  Had she done  so,  the
    existence of the (not disclosed)  savings  account  would  have  become
    apparent.   Secondly,  the  operation  of  paragraph  245AA(b)(iv)   "a
    document does not contain all of the specified information" should have
    led the respondent to make  enquiries  about  the  transfers  into  the
    account which would have led to disclosure of the savings account.

 6. I find that the judge erred in law such that her determination falls to
    be set aside.  I say that for the following  reasons.   The  respondent
    quite properly had regard to the  balances  shown  on  the  appellant's
    account during the relevant period.  There can be no dispute  that  the
    balance on the account dropped below the  permitted  minimum.   I  find
    that there was no obligation on the respondent to  enquire  as  to  the
    source of funds paid into the account and that the respondent  did  not
    fail in her obligation to carry out a proper and  substantive  analysis
    of the evidence by declining to make any enquiries  of  the  appellant.
    As regards paragraph  245AA(b)(iv)  I  find  that  the  bank  statement
    documents did "contain all of the specified information"  because  they
    contained details of the bank in which the account  was  held  and  the
    balances on  the  account  to  which  the  statement  related.   It  is
    stretching the meaning of sub-paragraph (iv) beyond breaking  point  to
    suggest that the "specified information" should  include  or  refer  to
    monies held in another account of which the Secretary of State  had  no
    knowledge or notice because the appellant had not  disclosed  it.   The
    appellant relies on a Policy Guidance document for Tier 4 applicants in
    which it is stated that;

         You must show you have enough money to cover  your  monthly  living
         costs while you are studying in the UK ... you have an  established
         presence studying in the UK, you must show that you have money  for
         your living costs for each month of your course, up to a maximum of
         two months.

    I cannot see any reason why that guidance should have led the Secretary
    of State to make the enquiries which the appellant and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal believed she should have made.

 7. Further, notwithstanding the payments into  the  disclosed  account  at
    HSBC from the undisclosed savings account, the minimum balance was  not
    maintained in the former account throughout the required period.  There
    was no reason at all for the Secretary of  State  to  assume  that  the
    account from which the  transfers  were  being  made  belonged  to  the
    appellant or, if it did, that  it  contained  funds  which  would  have
    enabled the  appellant  to  meet  the  maintenance  requirements.   The
    appellant simply failed to submit evidence  relating  to  the  accounts
    which she chose to disclose to the Secretary of State which showed that
    she met the requirements of the  Rules.   In  consequence,  her  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules should have been dismissed.

 8. Having allowed the appeal  under  the  Rules,  the  judge  went  on  to
    consider Article 8 ECHR.  At [15], she wrote:

         The respondent makes no reference to Article 8 of the ECHR  outside
         the Rules although Miss Brewer did make  submissions  upon  it.   I
         find that there are, in this particular case, arguably good grounds
         to consider the appellant's case outside the Rules under Article 8.



 9. The judge considered the question of proportionality [17].   She  noted
    the "significant investment the appellant and her parents have made  to
    enable her to  study  in  this  country."   She  noted  also  that  the
    appellant only has "six months to complete her  masters  course  having
    already obtained her bachelors degree."  The appellant had "contributed
    to the economy while studying  here  and  making  good  friends."   She
    allowed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

10. Given that the  judge  should  have  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules, her application of Gulshan (Article 8 - New Rules  -
    Correct Approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) was  in  error.   Applying  the
    principles of Gulshan and also MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192,  she
    should  first  have  considered  whether  there  were   compelling   or
    exceptional circumstances in the case which had  not  been  anticipated
    under the Immigration Rules but which required an assessment of Article
    8  outside  the  Rules.   Most  foreign  students  make  a  significant
    financial investment in their studies in this country and, by doing so,
    contribute to the economy.  Likewise, most foreign students make  "good
    friends" whilst living and  studying  here.   However,  none  of  those
    circumstances were so unusual or particular to  this  appellant  as  to
    have properly led the judge to consider  Article  8  ECHR  outside  the
    Immigration Rules let alone to have allowed the appeal on that basis.

11. I find that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  determination  should  be  set
    aside.  I have re-made the decision.  In the light of my  findings  and
    observations above, I find that the appeal should  be  dismissed  under
    the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).



DECISION

12. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated  on  25  March
    2014 is set aside.  I  have  re-made  the  decision.   This  appeal  is
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules.  This  appeal  is  dismissed  on
    human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
