                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the
   First-tier Tribunal (Judge Scott)  of  22  November  2018  allowing  the
   appeal of Mr AP, a citizen of Iran, itself brought against  the  refusal
   of his asylum claim of 6 February 2018. I have anonymised the  names  of
   the Respondent and his wife and other material witnesses.


2. Mr AP's asylum claim involved his conversion to  Christianity  in  Iran.
   Taking the starting point from the summary in the refusal letter, he had
   been dissatisfied with  the  Islamic  religion.  He  was  introduced  to
   Christianity by his friend Mr M and attended three house church sessions
   with him. From 18 December 2015 he considered himself to be a Christian.
   He introduced his wife, Ms PR, to the faith, and she had attended church
   with him. His conversion was discovered when a colleague and work made a
   complaint that Mr AP  and  Mr  M  had  been  evangelising.  The  Iranian
   authorities had searched for him since 14 February  2016,  visiting  his
   own home, and the houses of his  father  and  father-in-law.  He  feared
   being sentenced to death for apostasy on a return to Iran.

3. The Secretary of State accepted his claim to be an Iranian national  and
   to have been born into the Shia Muslim faith, and that  conversion  from
   Islam to another religion was a criminal offence.  However,  the  asylum
   claim was not accepted as credible, because

    a) Mr AP's explanation for his dissatisfaction with Islam was considered
       vague and unclear;
    b) His account of having been introduced to and converting to
       Christianity having attended only three house church meetings was
       found implausible;
    c) His claim to have come to the attention of the authorities due to a
       complaint at work over evangelising was unsubstantiated and there was
       nothing to suggest compromising material had been found when the
       authorities came looking for him;
    d) There was an inconsistency in relation to attending church in the UK
       and his baptism in this country;
    e) The level of knowledge he displayed at interview was basic and
       general.

The appeal below

4. Mr AP provided a witness statement and gave  oral  evidence  before  the
   First-tier Tribunal, in which he explained his account further.  He  had
   developed  a  long-standing  disillusionment  with   Islam,   which   he
   considered the Iranian regime used to justify  repression,  and  he  was
   forced to pray in Arabic, a language he did not  understand,  preventing
   any degree of connection with God. When he practised Islam  he  felt  he
   was merely going through the motions, whereas the more he learned  about
   Christianity, the happier he became. Mr M had vouched for  Mr  AP  as  a
   good friend when he attended the house church, and he embraced the faith
   thereafter; he dated his conversion as from 18th December 2015.


5. Shortly thereafter he and his wife married, in an Islamic ceremony, as a
   Christian one was not feasible. He  had  not  been  asked  at  interview
   whether any Christian materials might have been found when his house was
   raided; in fact he had received some notes from the house church and  he
   thought it likely these had been seized in the raid. He had travelled to
   the UK on a false passport provided by an agent to depart Iran.

6. He and his wife had been  warmly  received  at  the  Baptist  church  in
   Cardiff,  and  found  worshipping  openly  there  to  be   a   wonderful
   experience; there were many other Farsi speakers  there.  Some  baptisms
   were due to take place shortly after they joined the  congregation,  and
   following discussions with Reverend Rees of that church, it  was  agreed
   that given they already had a good knowledge of Christianity, they could
   be baptised  during  the  six-week  Bible  study  course  that  normally
   preceded baptism, which proceeded on 27 March 2016.

7. In April 2016 they were moved by NASS to Dagenham, where they started to
   attend a different church, where they  were  no  other  Iranians  making
   integration there difficult; nevertheless they attended every Sunday and
   helped out in any way they could.  Following  their  move  to  Dagenham,
   Reverend Rees provided Mr AP with a copy  of  his  baptism  certificate,
   signed and re-dated to confirm its genuineness.

8. From June 2017 he attended St Elizabeth's church, where there were  many
   other Farsi speakers; his wife did not attend with him as her health had
   deteriorated, and it was further from their home. He shared  details  of
   the service with her upon returning home from church; they would worship
   together at home.

9. The Reverend Hanna, Vicar  of  St  Elizabeth's  church,  gave  evidence,
   having written a letter of 18 March 2018, explaining that St Elizabeth's
   was an evangelical Christian church, and that he  himself  was  familiar
   with Muslims and Islam, hosting discussion evenings between the  faiths.
   Mr AP had regularly worshipped at his church for  over  a  year,  having
   previously worshipped at  a  church  closer  to  his  house  with  fewer
   Iranians; the Minister, Reverend Rees, was well known to  him.  Reverend
   Hanna was satisfied that the Appellant was a genuine Christian, from his
   prayers and his relationship with others  at  the  church;  he  did  not
   believe he could have  been  hoodwinked  into  so  thinking,  given  the
   evidence he had seen of the Appellant's love for  the  Lord  Jesus,  his
   concern to live rightly and his desire to know more.

10. Mr AP's wife Ms PR gave evidence, confirming  the  details  of  her  own
   health problems and describing their worship at home. She explained that
   she had worked in the same department at the airport as Mr AP had  done.
   She knew he had converted to Christianity  before  their  marriage.  She
   accepted his faith, and had become interested in it  herself,  attending
   the house church with him and over time becoming a believer too.

11.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  noted  the  evidence  before  it,  including
   supporting evidence by way of a letter from  Reverend  Mike  Reith,  the
   Minister of the first church the Appellant  had  attended  in  Dagenham,
   stating the Appellant to have been a genuine and committed  congregation
   member, and a baptism certificate from the Reverend Rees,  recording  Mr
   AP's baptism on 27 March 2017, signed again on 13 July  2016.  It  noted
   that Mr AP's evidence in  cross  examination  was  consistent  and  that
   whilst section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of  Claimants,
   etc.) Act 2004 had been relied on by the Secretary of State, Mr  AP  had
   given an adequate explanation of his need to rely on an agent,  and  had
   additionally claimed asylum on arrival.

12. The Judge concluded that "Having considered all  the  evidence,  I  find
   that the appellant has maintained  a  consistent  and  credible  account
   which is supported by the evidence of his wife and Reverend  Hanna.  His
   account is also consistent with, and  is  supported  by,  the  documents
   submitted, all  of  which  I  find  to  be  reliable.  I  am  satisfied,
   therefore,  to  the  appropriate  lower  standard  of  proof,  that  the
   appellant's story is true in all material respects."

13. Based on that finding, credibility being the only matter in  issue,  the
   Tribunal accepted that Mr AP was a Christian convert. Such  individuals,
   if they who lived openly in Iran, would be liable  to  persecution.  The
   Judge did not believe that Mr AP would evangelise openly on a return  to
   Iran; it was more likely that he  would  be  discreet.  That  discretion
   would be borne of his fear of persecution. Thus he had  a  well  founded
   fear of persecution for religious reasons.  There  was  no  question  of
   obtaining protection from  the  authorities  given  the  nature  of  the
   Iranian state.

14. The Secretary of State lodged an appeal  on  27  November  208,  arguing
   that no reasons were given for  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  conclusions
   that Mr AP had maintained a consistent and credible account,  citing  MK
   (Pakistan) for the proposition that  reasoned  findings  were  essential
   where oral  evidence  was  found  incredible,  and  Budhathoki  for  the
   proposition that whilst not all evidence needed to be addressed, it  was
   essential to identify and  resolve  the  key  evidential  conflicts  and
   explain their reasons for preferring one case to the other.

15. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  13
   December 2018 on the basis that  the  extremely  brief  content  of  the
   credibility conclusions rendered the grounds arguable.

16. Before me, Mr Walker relied on the grounds of appeal,  emphasising  that
   the First-tier Tribunal decision had been concise in the extreme in  the
   approach taken to the assessment of credibility. In response  Ms  Harris
   argued that this was a case where  credibility  had  been  rejected  for
   reasons of plausibility rather than inconsistency, and  when  addressing
   such a basis for refusal the necessary  reasoning  would  inevitably  be
   somewhat shorter than when detailing various aspects  of  evidence  that
   were considered discrepant. All the relevant evidence had been set  out,
   Section 8 of the 2004  Act  had  been  addressed  by  reference  to  the
   Appellant's explanation for his use of a false document, and the Judge's
   thinking was clear to the  reader.  In  short,  he  had  heard  credible
   evidence from a Minister of the Church as to the  Appellant's  religious
   convictions, and he had  considered  his  credibility  findings  in  the
   context of the documentary evidence as a whole. That level of  reasoning
   sufficed.

Findings and reasons

17. The authorities recognise that  reasons  must  be  given  for  both  the
   determination of the appeal and the material findings of fact upon which
   that decision is based, in sufficient detail to "enable  the  reader  to
   know what conclusion the decision maker has  reached  on  the  principal
   controversial issues":  see Lord Bridge in Save Britain's Heritage v  No
   1 Poultry Ltd [1991] 1 WLR 153. As stated by  the  President  in  Shizad
   [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC) �10: "reasons need not be extensive if the decision
   as a whole makes sense, having regard to the material  accepted  by  the
   judge".


18. In Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC) the  Upper
   Tribunal states:

      "It is generally unnecessary and  unhelpful  for  First-tier  Tribunal
      judgments to rehearse every detail or issue raised  in  a  case.  This
      leads to judgments becoming overly long and  confused  and  is  not  a
      proportionate approach to deciding cases. It  is,  however,  necessary
      for judges to identify and resolve key conflicts in the  evidence  and
      explain in clear and brief terms their reasons, so  that  the  parties
      can understand why they have won or lost."


19. The headnote to MK Pakistan [2013] UKUT 641 (IAC) states:


      "(2) If a tribunal finds oral evidence to be  implausible,  incredible
      or unreliable or a document to be worth no weight  whatsoever,  it  is
      necessary to say so in the determination and for such findings  to  be
      supported by reasons. A bare statement that a witness was not believed
      or that a document was afforded no weight is unlikely to  satisfy  the
      requirement to give reasons."


20. So there can be no doubt that significant credibility  findings  require
   some degree of reasoning. However, in the specific context of acceptance
   rather than rejection of a witness's evidence, it is useful to refer  to
   the approach taken in the higher courts in onwards  immigration  appeals
   turning on credibility  assessment.  A  number  of  senior  judges  have
   indicated that the duty to give reasons for accepting oral evidence can,
   at least in some circumstances, be somewhat lighter than when  rejecting
   evidence.


    a) For example Buxton LJ in RH (Ghana) [2007] EWCA Civ 640 stated �14
       that "it is not required of a tribunal of fact, particularly one that
       has heard witnesses, to say more than that it fully accepts the
       evidence of the one witness."


    b) Toulson LJ in JK (Democratic Republic of Congo) [2007] EWCA Civ 831
       �31 wrote that "The degree of reasoning required to support a finding
       of fact must depend on the circumstances.  If a judge disbelieves a
       witness in evidence, he must obviously state why he disbelieves it.
       If he believes a witness's evidence, there may be not much more that
       the judge can say than to refer in summary to the main points
       advanced to the contrary, together with the witness's response to
       them, in order to show that the judge has considered them, and to
       express his conclusion that he finds the witness to be credible.'


    c) Buxton LJ in Tarlochan Singh (5 July 1999; IATRF 1999/0055/4) stated,
       of an appeal onwards from the old Immigration Appellate Authority
       where the appeal Tribunal had found the first instance decision
       maker's concisely expressed acceptance of a witness's credibility to
       be insufficient: "The approach of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, I
       have to say with respect, to some extent presents the matter in a way
       that undermines and gives insufficient weight to the adjudicator's
       assessment of Mr Singh as a witness. To complain that no reasoned
       basis was given for preferring Mr Singh's evidence on those points
       really misses the point. The adjudicator was entitled to say that he
       accepted Mr Singh's evidence because, looking at the case as a whole,
       he found it credible. So far as reasoning is concerned, it is
       difficult to see how much further he could have gone."


    d) In Allport v Wilboram [2004] EWCA Civ 1668 (cited in MK (Pakistan)),
       Neuberger LJ (as he then was) stated �44-45:


           "... it is frequently difficult to explain wholly satisfactorily
           why one rejects or accepts one particular piece of evidence,  or
           the evidence given by one particular  witness,  while  accepting
           another ... a judge sometimes has no  real  alternative  but  to
           decide which version of events is  inherently  more  likely,  or
           which of the two witnesses appears to him to be inherently  more
           believable. "


21. The foregoing sets the scene for considering the adequacy of the  First-
   tier Tribunal's reasoning. This is not a case  where  the  Judge  simply
   accepted the asylum seeker's account without more. He  stated  that  his
   account was consistent, and was supported by the evidence  of  the  live
   witnesses, his wife and Reverend  Hanna,  as  well  as  the  documentary
   evidence.


22. So the merits of the Secretary of State's challenge depends squarely  on
   the nature of  the  refusal  reasons  which  confronted  the  First-tier
   Tribunal, as set out above. Neither the grounds of appeal nor Mr  Walker
   before me suggested that the First-tier Tribunal did any  disservice  to
   the Home Office's refusal letter when summarising it.


23.  Those  refusal  reasons  largely  refer  to  questions   of   perceived
   plausibility and vagueness; there is a single reference to  discrepancy,
   which when one goes to the original refusal letter, transpires to relate
   partly to an "internal discrepancy" said to be "unreasonable" but  which
   is in substance a matter of plausibility, viz that Mr  AP's  UK  baptism
   took place with surprising speed following his arrival in  the  UK.  The
   other aspect of "discrepancy" was a reference to the difference  between
   the date of issue of the baptism certificate as opposed  to  the  rather
   later date of Reverend Rees's signature upon that document.  These  were
   both matters that were explained in far greater detail  in  the  witness
   statement and oral evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  than  before
   the Secretary of State, and it seems to me that it was here difficult to
   see what more the Judge could have done than to simply say  he  accepted
   those explanations. As to  the  alleged  vagueness  in  the  Appellant's
   account of his journey to Christianity or of the tenets  of  the  faith,
   this criticism rather fell away given  the  significant  detail  in  the
   witness  statements  combined  with  the  endorsements  of  his  faith's
   credibility from Ministers of UK-based churches.

24. I do not  consider  that  the  authorities  cited  in  the  grounds  are
   inconsistent with this analysis. True it is that MK (Pakistan)  stresses
   that reasoned findings were essential  where  the  credibility  of  oral
   evidence is rejected, but that requirement is recognised by the Court of
   Appeal authorities, which then go  on  to  differentiate  the  situation
   where evidence is accepted, particularly  on  plausibility  grounds.  It
   seems to me that the Judge's acceptance  of  the  detailed  explanations
   given for the matters considered vague or implausible meets the standard
   of reasoning required by Budhathoki.

25. So in conclusion I do not accept that the First-tier Tribunal  made  any
   material error of law.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of
    law.
    The appeal is dismissed.

    Anonymity Order


    I make an anonymity order under Rule 14(1) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
