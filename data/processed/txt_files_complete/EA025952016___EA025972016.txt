                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Malik, promulgated on 18 May 2016. Permission to appeal was granted  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Page on 23 September 2016.

Anonymity

 2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now

Background

 3. The first respondent, who is an  Irish  national,  entered  the  United
    Kingdom during May 2004 and was subsequently issued with a registration
    certificate valid from October 2005 until  December  2010.  The  second
    respondent last entered the United Kingdom during 2003 and  was  issued
    with a residence card as the spouse of an EEA  national,  that  is  the
    first  respondent,  on  7  October  2010.  On  3  September  2015   the
    respondents sought permanent residence in the United Kingdom.

 4. The Secretary of State refused the respondents'  claims  for  permanent
    residence on the basis that  the  first  respondent  had  not  provided
    evidence that he had resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance  with
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, for a period
    of 5 years. In particular, it was said that the first respondent failed
    to provide evidence that he had the requisite health  insurance  during
    the period when he was a student and it was not accepted  that  he  had
    been a worker throughout the period between 2004 and 2012 owing to  the
    lack of evidence thereof. It  was  accepted  that  the  respondent  was
    exercising treaty rights as a worker between  July  2012  and  February
    2016.

 5. In appealing the refusal of their applications, the respondents  argued
    that the first respondent had been exercising treaty rights for over  5
    years. A Substantial quantity of  original,  documentary  evidence  was
    enclosed with the notice of appeal which addressed the issues of health
    insurance and the respondent's employment.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the appeal proceeded  on
    the papers as requested by the respondents. The  judge  concluded  that
    the first respondent had health insurance owing to his provision  of  a
    European Health Insurance Card. The judge further  concluded  that  the
    first respondent was a worker between November 2010 and April 2012  and
    therefore met the requirements of Regulation 15.

The grounds of appeal

 7. The grounds of appeal in support of  the  application  argue  that  the
    judge made a material misdirection in law because the sums shown in the
    P60's did not suggest employment throughout the entire period and  that
    there was a gap in employment between April  2011  and  February  2012.
    Furthermore, it was argued that the second respondent did not meet  the
    requirements of Regulation 4(2) and therefore could  not  rely  on  the
    time spent by the first respondent as a student.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the  respondent  had
    raised arguable errors that warranted full consideration.

 9. The respondents' Rule 24 response, dated 10 October 2016,  included  an
    application under paragraph 15(2A) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 to submit additional  evidence.  In  essence,  the
    respondents wished to submit bank statements, a contract of employment,
    P45, payslips and emails relating to the period between April 2011  and
    February 2012.

10. It was also argued that the first respondent retained his status  as  a
    worker between November 2011 and February 2012 when he was not working,
    which was a period of less  than  six  months  and  that  he  had  also
    registered as a jobseeker during the same period. The  respondents  did
    not understand the  Secretary  of  State's  second  ground  of  appeal,
    regarding which permission to appeal was not granted.

The hearing

11. Mr Avery had not seen the respondents' Rule 24 response and I gave  him
    time to peruse the file copy. Furthermore, he stated that the judge was
    in possession of far more documents  than  seen  by  the  Secretary  of
    State. In relation to the grounds on which permission was  granted,  Mr
    Avery argued that the judge did not say where  the  first  respondent's
    EHIC card was issued. If it was issued in the United Kingdom, this  was
    of no assistance to the respondents. Accordingly, he  argued  that  the
    judge's findings were insufficient in respect of his finding  that  the
    first respondent was a student in the United Kingdom in accordance with
    the Regulations. After  acknowledging  that  the  respondent's  studies
    ended in June 2010, Mr Avery accepted that the P60 for  2011  indicated
    earnings, but that after this there was a gap between 6 April 2011  and
    27 February 2012. He submitted that  there  was  no  reference  in  the
    judge's decision as to where the first respondent  was  working  during
    that period.

12. Mr Roberts told me that the EHIC was  issued  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    however he had been exercising treaty rights since he  left  university
    in 2010 and had further evidence to submit. I asked him to  state  what
    evidence was before the judge. He explained that he had worked for  the
    same employer, from prior to April  2011  until  August  2011  and  had
    provided a form P60 in relation to that work. Thereafter he had  worked
    for 3 months between September and November 2011 for  another  employer
    but had not included evidence of this work in the documents before  the
    judge. He was registered  as  a  jobseeker  from  November  2011  until
    January 2012 but did not submit evidence of this. Finally, he  returned
    to work at IMSERV (the previous employer) in January 2012.

13. The evidence before the judge showed earnings of �2,511.20 for the year
    ending April 2012 and I was able to find the original P60  relating  to
    this employment among the documents which were  before  the  judge.  Mr
    Roberts explained that  his  wife  was  also  working  throughout  this
    period, they were receiving tax credits and that he was earning �9  per
    hour.

14. In reply, Mr Avery queried whether the earnings shown in the P60  which
    was before the judge were sufficient.



Decision on error of law

15. At the end of the hearing, I announced that  the  evidence  before  the
    judge was sufficient for him to find  that  the  first  respondent  was
    exercising treaty rights as a worker and that the decision  was  upheld
    to that extent.

16. I should add that the judge was wrong to find that the first respondent
    was exercising treaty rights as a student under the Regulations because
    the EHIC card did not  constitute  evidence  of  the  requisite  health
    insurance. Therefore the judge erred regarding this but his  error  was
    not material because he also found that  the  first  respondent  was  a
    worker throughout a continuous 5-year period.

17. I should emphasise  that  the  first  respondent  has  now  produced  a
    substantial quantity of evidence which puts his activities  during  the
    financial year ending April 2012 beyond doubt. That evidence included a
    job offer letter, P45 relating to his  job  seekers  registration,  P45
    regarding a period of employment with Matrix SCM  and  bank  statements
    showing confirming receipt  of  earnings  from  IMSERV.  None  of  this
    evidence was before the First-tier Tribunal Judge and I have  therefore
    not taken it into consideration in  determining  whether  the  previous
    decision involved an error of law.

18. The original evidence of earnings, in the form  of  a  P60,  which  was
    before the judge showed that the first respondent earned a little  over
    �2,500 during the financial year ending in April 2012. The Secretary of
    State's argument is that the only gap in the evidence  between  is  for
    the period between April 2011 and February 2012.

19. The respondents' evidence is that the earnings shown in  the  P60  were
    earned in the earlier part of the financial year. The working hours for
    the period between April 2011 and February 2012 average around a little
    over 6 per week at �9 per hour. In determining whether  this  part-time
    employment suffices, I have been assisted by the judgment in Hava  Genc
    v Land Berlin (C-14/09), where 5.5 hours' week paid  at  EUR  7.87  per
    hour was held to amount to real and genuine employment,  regardless  of
    the fact that those earnings only partially covered the minimum  income
    necessary for subsistence.

20. In finding that the first respondent's employment with  IMSERV  at  the
    time in question was not on such a  small  scale  to  be  marginal  and
    ancillary, I consider it relevant to note that he has been working  for
    the same employer, albeit not continuously, for a number of  years,  up
    to and including at the time of the hearing before  the  First-tier  in
    May 2016. His hourly rate of pay when working part-time was  well  over
    the minimum wage which reflects the fact the respondent was by  then  a
    graduate working in a skilled role. In the  application  for  permanent
    residence, the evidence relating to this employer was verified  by  the
    Secretary of State in relation  to  the  first  respondent's  permanent
    contract of employment which  commenced  in  July  2012  and  continued
    until, at least, the time of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier.   I
    consider the fact that the first respondent's temporary employment with
    the IMSERV resulted in a permanent contract of employment, verified  by
    the Secretary of State as genuine,  underlines  the  real  and  genuine
    nature of the earlier part-time employment with the same company.

21. In Genc, the fact that the claimant received welfare  benefits  was  no
    barrier to her being considered a worker and was considered to have  no
    consequence to that question. Indeed, the  respondents'  earned  income
    was topped up by tax credits. Evidence of those tax  credits  was  also
    before the First-tier.

22. In conclusion, I find that the first respondent's employment during the
    financial year ending 2012, which was evidenced before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal amounted to  genuine  part-time  employment  and  was  not  so
    marginal and ancillary as not to be genuine  and  effective.  That  the
    respondents required a source of supplementary income in  the  form  of
    tax credits does not affect the question of whether  the  activity  was
    genuine and effective.

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge is upheld.



Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.
