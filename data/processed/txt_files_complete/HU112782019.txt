For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the  Ivory  Coast  who  was  born  on  16
    November 1978.  He entered the United Kingdom on 2 July 2014 as a  Tier
    5 Migrant with leave valid until 20 May 2015.  He overstayed and  on  7
    June 2016 he was served with RED.0001.

 2. On 12 June 2016, the appellant made an asylum claim.   That  claim  was
    refused on 9 December 2016.  He appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and, on 26 April 2017, his appeal was  dismissed.   He  became  appeals
    rights exhausted on 1 August 2017.

 3. On 19 March 2019, the appellant made a human rights  claim  based  upon
    his relationship with his  partner,  Sharron  Horn  who  is  a  British
    citizen.

 4. On 17 June 2019, the Secretary of State refused the appellant's  claims
    under the Immigration Rules and Art 8 of the ECHR.

 5. The  appellant  again  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  a
    determination sent on 12  November  2019,  Judge  Lever  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8.  The Judge was not satisfied that:  (1)
    the appellant met the requirements of the Rules as  a  'partner'  under
    Appendix FM (in particular, para EX.1) and  under  para  276ADE(1)  (in
    particular sub-paragraph (vi)); and (2) the appellant's  removal  would
    breach Art 8 outside the Rules.

 6. The appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal by
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Bird) on 17 April 2020, in particular on
    the ground that it was arguable that the judge  had  erred  in  law  by
    failing to take into account the medical evidence concerning the mental
    health issues of the appellant and of his partner, Ms Horn.

 7. The appeal was listed for a remote hearing by Skype for Business on  17
    December 2020 at the Cardiff Civil Justice  Centre.   I  was  based  in
    court and the appellant and Mr Howells, who represented  the  Secretary
    of State, attended via Skype for Business.

 8. At the outset  of  the  hearing,  I  explained  to  the  appellant  the
    procedure and the purpose of the error of law hearing.   The  appellant
    then made submissions based upon the grounds of  appeal  which  he  had
    drafted, including that the judge had failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    medical evidence of his mental  health  and  the  impact  upon  him  of
    returning to the Ivory Coast.

 9. Having heard the appellant's  submissions,  Mr  Howells  accepted  that
    counsel (who had represented the appellant at the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing) had, in her skeleton argument, relied  upon  medical  evidence
    about the appellant's mental health: a letter    from  the  appellant's
    GP) dated 26 February 2019 (B9 of the bundle) and a therapist's  letter
    dated 2 September 2019 (D6 of the bundle).  Mr  Howells  accepted  that
    the judge had made no reference to this evidence and, as a result,  had
    not considered the impact upon the  appellant's  mental  health  if  he
    returned to the Ivory Coast.  He conceded that was a material error  of
    law and that the judge's decision should be set aside and the  decision
    be remade by remittal to the First-tier Tribunal.

10. I agree with Mr Howells' concession that the judge  material  erred  in
    law by failing to take into  account  (and  reach  findings  upon)  the
    medical evidence concerning  the  appellant's  mental  health  and  the
    impact upon that if he were removed to  the  Ivory  Coast  in  reaching
    findings under the Rules and Art 8 outside the Rules.

Decision

11. For the above reasons, the judge's decision to dismiss the  appellant's
    appeal under Article 8 involved the making of a material error of  law.
    That decision cannot stand and is set aside.

12. Given the nature and extent of fact-finding required, and having regard
    to para 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice  Statement,  the  proper
    disposal of this appeal is to remit to the First-tier Tribunal for a de
    novo re-hearing in respect of Article 8.  The appeal to be heard  by  a
    judge other than Judge Lever.

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                            17 December 2020
