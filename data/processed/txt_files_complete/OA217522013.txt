Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms E Lagunju, instructed by Howe & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms AB Weller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Jeni Limbu, date of  birth  22.9.91,  is  a  citizen  of
    Nepal.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Chamberlain promulgated 24.10.14, dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer,  dated  20.11.13,  to  refuse
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the  adult  dependent  of  Mrs
    Indrakumari Limbu, an ex-Ghurkha widow, resident in Nepal.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 2.10.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Astle refused permission on 6.1.15.  However,
    when the application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal, on 8.5.15 Upper
    Tribunal Judge Finch granted permission to appeal.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.8.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Chamberlain should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant's father served 15 years with the Brigade of  Gurkhas,  until
    1977. It is asserted that he was unjustly  denied  the  opportunity  to
    apply for settlement in the UK until the  injustice  was  corrected  in
    2009. He took up settlement in 2011, but  died  in  2013  without  ever
    making or supporting an application for his wife and the appellant,  or
    indeed  other  children  to  join  him.  On  7.11.13  his  widow,   the
    appellant's mother  and  sponsor,  was  granted  settlement  rights  in
    recognition of her late husband's service. However, it is asserted that
    the sponsor was unable to travel to the UK because she  is  reliant  on
    the assistance of the appellant for her kidney dialysis treatment.

 7. The application was refused, as there are no provisions under the Rules
    or any discretionary criteria for consideration of adult children of ex-
    Gurkha widows. It is a choice for the mother whether she wishes to take
    up the UK settlement visa and there is no provision  under  the  policy
    for entry clearance to be granted to the carer of a parent. It is clear
    that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the  adult  dependent  relative
    requirements of EC-DR.1.1 of Appendix FM.

 8. The Entry Clearance Manager  has  pointed  out  that  the  sponsor  was
    granted settlement under a discretionary  concession  afforded  to  the
    widows of ex-Ghurkas and there is  no  policy  guidance  requiring  the
    consideration of adult children of widows, the appellant being an adult
    at the date of application.  The  discretionary  guidance  relating  to
    children of ex-Gurkhas does not apply to the facts of this case.

 9. The claim before the First-tier Tribunal was based entirely outside the
    Rules on family life under article 8 ECHR.

10. At �25 of the decision the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that  family
    life existed between the appellant and the sponsor,  but  concluded  at
    �26 that the decision did not interfere with that family life,  as  the
    sponsor had chosen to remain in Nepal with her daughter the  appellant.
    Relevant to that decision, the judge noted that as this is  an  out  of
    country application the appeal must be decided  on  the  basis  of  the
    circumstances prevailing at the date of decision, 20.11.13. It remained
    to be seen  whether  the  sponsor  would  or  would  not  take  up  the
    settlement entry clearance, which will expire in November 2015.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Finch found  it  arguable  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to  apply  the  five-stage  Razgar
    test and failed to correctly apply Ghising and others  (Gurkhas/BACs  -
    historic wrong -weight) [2013] UKUT 567 (IAC).

12. The Rule  24  response,  dated  19.5.15,  provides  little  assistance,
    submitting only that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  directed  himself
    properly. In her submissions at the outset of the hearing before me, Ms
    Weller accepted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not address  the
    historic injustice issue or apply Ghising, but submitted that the error
    was not material as the judge found that the decision did not interfere
    with the family life between the appellant and  the  sponsor,  as  they
    were both living in Nepal. The  historical  injustice  principles  only
    applies in conducting the proportionality balancing  exercise,  but  if
    the family life argument fails at the earlier hurdle  of  interference,
    the proportionality balancing exercise is not reached.

13. Ms Lagunju's very straightforward submissions were that as the  sponsor
    sought and had been granted settlement rights in the UK,  the  decision
    to refuse the application of the appellant her daughter would interfere
    with their family life, as the appellant would not be able to join  the
    sponsor. Ms Lagunju submitted that family life ought to  be  considered
    not simply on the basis of the existing circumstances, but the right to
    continue and develop  family  life  in  the  UK  in  pursuance  of  the
    settlement rights granted to the sponsor. If the sponsor comes  to  the
    UK without  the  appellant  the  family  life  between  them  would  be
    ruptured. Reliance  is  additionally  placed  on  the  exceptional  and
    compelling circumstances of the sponsor's health and medical issues.

14. Whilst it may be argued that  but  for  the  historical  injustice  the
    appellant would have been brought to the UK with her mother and  father
    whilst still a child, that is not necessarily so on the facts  of  this
    case. The father came to the UK on his own,  leaving  the  sponsor  the
    appellant behind in Nepal, and neither he nor they made any application
    for settlement before he passed away in 2013.

15. As the judge noted, the appellant lives in the  family  home  with  the
    sponsor. There was no witness  statement  from  the  appellant  and  no
    evidence adduced at the First-tier Tribunal to substantiate  the  claim
    that the only reason the sponsor remains in Nepal is that she is unable
    to come to the UK without the appellant. There was no evidence that the
    appellant is the only person who can or even does care for her  mother.
    Neither did the judge find that the sponsor was unable to travel to the
    UK without the appellant.  At �27 the judge found  that  the  appellant
    "has failed to show that the decision effectively prevents the  sponsor
    from  enjoying  her  entitlement  to  indefinite  leave.  That  is  the
    sponsor's own choice." Elsewhere  the  judge  noted  that  the  sponsor
    receives financial assistance from friends in the UK.

16. On those facts and the limited evidence as  found  by  the  judge,  the
    conclusion that the decision did not interfere  with  the  family  life
    enjoyed by the appellant and the sponsor is one to which the judge  was
    entitled to come and for which cogent reasons have  been  provided.  As
    the judge stated at �29, the appellant failed  to  demonstrate  on  the
    balance  of  probabilities  that  the  decision  interferes  with   the
    protected rights of either or both the appellant and  the  sponsor.  It
    may be that with better or further evidence the burden of  establishing
    the  primary  elements  of  article  8  family  life  could  have  been
    discharged, but as presented to the First-tier  Tribunal  the  evidence
    was insufficient.

17. It follows that I find no material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.



Conclusions:

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity
order. No submissions were made on the issue.  Given  the  circumstances,  I
make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
