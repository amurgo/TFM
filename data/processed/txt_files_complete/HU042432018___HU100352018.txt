                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      Introduction


        1. Permission to appeal was granted to the Secretary of  State  for
           the Home Department  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
           Macdonald on 15 May 2019  against  the  decision  to  allow  the
           Respondents' linked Article 8 ECHR appeals  made  by  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge Barker in a decision and reasons  promulgated  on
           12 April 2019.


        2. The Respondents are nationals of  Pakistan,  husband  and  wife,
           respectively born on 4 June 1982 and 28  May  1987.   The  First
           Respondent had applied for leave to remain on the  basis  of  10
           years'  lawful  continuous  long  residence   and   the   Second
           Respondent had applied on the basis of her family life with  the
           First Respondent and their  children.   The  First  Respondent's
           application  was  refused  under   paragraph   322(5)   of   the
           Immigration Rules, on  the  principal  grounds  that  the  First
           Respondent had misdeclared  his  income  tax  in  his  2010/2011
           return and again in 2012/2013.  This meant that his  application
           also fell to be refused on Suitability grounds  under  paragraph
           276ADE(1)(i) of the Immigration Rules.  The Second  Respondent's
           Article 8 ECHR application was refused  because  there  were  no
           exceptional circumstances and no compassionate  factors.   Their
           family life could be enjoyed in Pakistan.


        3. Judge Barker found that the First Respondent was not credible in
           his explanations and  had  been  dishonest  in  his  income  tax
           declarations to HMRC.  He found that this was not connected with
           the First Respondent's applications for further leave to remain.
            Taking all matters into  account,  the  judge  found  that  the
           mischief of the First Respondent was not sufficient  to  trigger
           the general  ground  of  refusal  in  paragraph  332(5)  of  the
           Immigration Rules. The judge went on to consider the  Article  8
           ECHR  family  life  issues  and  the  best  interests   of   the
           Respondents' two children, and allowed the Respondents' appeals.


        4. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  Designated  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge Macdonald because the judge had  found  that  the
           evidence on behalf of the First Respondent  had  been  poor  and
           that there had been  dishonesty.    That  was  not  sufficiently
           reflected in the judge's decision to allow the appeals.


      Submissions


      5.    Mr Tufan for the Appellant relied on the grounds  submitted  and
           the grant of permission to appeal.  The judge's clear finding of
           dishonesty showed that the appeals should not have been allowed.
            The Court of Appeal in  Balajigari  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673  had
           provided relevant  guidance  in  the  application  of  paragraph
           322(5) of the Immigration Rules, which showed that a  two  stage
           analysis was required, see [33] of  that  decision.   The  first
           step was to decide whether  paragraph  322(5)  applied  at  all,
           i.e., whether it was "undesirable" to grant leave in  the  light
           of the specified matters.  The second step was to  decide  as  a
           matter of discretion whether leave should  be  refused  on  that
           basis.   The  judge  had  found  that  there  was  no   innocent
           explanation and that the First Respondent  had  been  deceitful.
           There was no  challenge  to  the  judge's  findings  about  that
           deception.  But the judge's finding that it was not relevant  to
           his application for further leave to remain was  plainly  wrong,
           especially as the judge had referred to the strange  coincidence
           of  the  review  of  tax  matters  immediately  prior   to   the
           application: see [38]  of  Judge  Barker's  determination.   The
           judge's  decision  that  discretion   should   nevertheless   be
           exercised in the First Respondent's favour  was  not  adequately
           reasoned and should be set aside. The onwards appeal  should  be
           allowed  and  the  original  decision  remade  and  the  appeals
           dismissed.


      6.    Ms Jones  for  the  Respondents  submitted  that  there  was  no
           material   error   of   law   in   the   First-tier   Tribunal's
           determination.  The judge had in effect  anticipated  Balijigari
           (above), and had applied a two stage test.  He found undesirable
           conduct but that the discretion should nevertheless be exercised
           in  the  Respondents'  favour,  for  sufficient  reasons   which
           included the best interests of the Respondents' children.   That
           applied [39] of Balijigari.  The  judge's  views  could  not  be
           characterised as "Wednesbury" unreasonable  and  should  not  be
           interfered with even  if  another  view  could  be  taken.   The
           determination was very thorough and should not be set aside.


      7.    In reply, Mr Tufan pointed out that neither of the  Respondents'
           children  were  "qualifying".   The  judge  had  not  found  any
           exceptional circumstances.  It was unclear  why  the  Article  8
           ECHR appeals had been allowed.


      8.    At this stage the tribunal indicated  that  it  wished  to  hear
           submissions from both sides as to  the  proper  outcome  of  the
           appeals in the event that a material error of law were found, to
           save the parties from a further attendance.  Ms Jones  confirmed
           that she had prepared  for  that  possibility  and  required  no
           additional time.


      9.    With reservations as to whether further evidence was needed,  Ms
           Jones submitted that a "balance sheet" approach was appropriate.
            There were strong positives.  The Respondents could  show  long
           and  continuous  lawful  entry  and  presence,  with  3C   leave
           applicable.  The children were born in the United  Kingdom  (May
           2016 and July 2018) and were on a settlement path.   The  family
           were integrated and self supporting.   There  had  been  medical
           problems for the second child which were of great concern to the
           parents.  The negative factors were as had  been  identified  by
           Judge Barker.


      10.   Mr Tufan submitted that  the  negative  factors  outweighed  the
           positive and that the family life could be continued in Pakistan
           without very serious obstacles.


      Material error of law found


      11.   The tribunal reserved its decision which now  follows.   Appeals
           such as the present have arrived in significant numbers  in  the
           First-tier Tribunal and have  caused  a  degree  of  difficulty.
           Paragraph 276B of the  Immigration  Rules  could  be  made  more
           specific in its reach, with advantage, given  the  Secretary  of
           State for the Home Department's view of the serious consequences
           for character and conduct of tax breaches by applicants  seeking
           further leave to remain.


      12.   The determination of  Judge  Barker  was  full  and  endeavoured
           conscientiously to wrestle with the issues.  He applied R v Khan
           [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC), but unfortunately Balajigari (above)  had
           not yet been published and he did not have the  benefit  of  the
           valuable discussion and guidance there provided, not least as to
           dishonesty: see [35] onwards of that decision.


      13.   In the  tribunal's  reading  of  his  decision,  the  First-tier
           Tribunal judge reached his decision to allow  the  appeals  with
           palpable reluctance, as well  he  might  have  done,  given  his
           extensive adverse credibility findings reached against the First
           Respondent and his accountant.  In effect those  amounted  to  a
           finding that there had been a conspiracy to defraud HMRC, over a
           period of  several  years.   Another  telling  finding,  in  the
           tribunal's view, is that the attempt to correct  the  deliberate
           and known errors in the First Respondent's tax returns was  only
           made before the application for ILR.  The judge considered  that
           the misconduct was not connected  with  the  First  Respondent's
           income for the purpose of  leave  to  remain,  although  how  he
           reached that finding is not  clear.   The  reasons  for  refusal
           letter stated in terms that the First  Respondent's  income  had
           been misstated to assist his Tier  1  applications  to  succeed.
           Later in the determination, Judge Barker states "I am  satisfied
           that the appellant fulfils all  the  requirements  of  paragraph
           276B and that there would  be  a  disproportionate  interference
           with his private life if he were removed."


      14.   In the tribunal's view, both those statements  are  mistaken  if
           not contradictory: the First  Respondent's  repeated  dishonesty
           meant that he was vulnerable to refusal under paragraph 276B, as
           he was well  aware.   Hence  (as  the  judge  found)  the  First
           Respondent had attempted to put  his  affairs  in  order  before
           making his long residence application.   The  judge  found  that
           there had been misconduct  which  brought  into  play  paragraph
           276B, yet later found that the requirements  of  paragraph  276B
           had been met.  The judge  can  only  have  meant  in  the  later
           reference that the long continuous lawful residence elements had
           been met,  not  the  character  and  conduct  element.   In  the
           tribunal's view, the required two stage approach  had  not  been
           followed or not followed in sufficient depth, so that the  judge
           was inadvertently proceeding on one or more false premises.


      15.   It further seems to the tribunal that the judge  might  usefully
           have stepped back after reaching his properly  reasoned  adverse
           credibility findings, and  asked  how  in  the  light  of  those
           findings  that  could  possibly  have  meant  that   the   First
           Respondent was  a  suitable  person  to  be  granted  ILR.   His
           character and  conduct,  if  not  also  his  associations,  were
           undesirable.  There was substantial under declaration of taxable
           income, as seen  in  the  2010/2011  tax  year,  when  allowable
           expenses were stated as �32,044 instead of the  true  figure  of
           �3,004.  The character and conduct found  by  the  judge  was  a
           finding that the First Respondent was failing  in  a  number  of
           respects, not merely knowingly failing to meet  his  income  tax
           obligations, but conspiring with another to do so, and then with
           that other person lying in a tribunal.


      16.   It seems to the tribunal that  the  judge's  evaluation  of  the
           First  Respondent's  conduct  was  inadequate,  far  beyond  any
           reasonable difference of opinion on the same facts.  That places
           the judge's whole decision on an uncertain foundation, such that
           his conclusions cannot stand.  The decision must  be  set  aside
           and remade.


      Remaking the decision


      17.   In this section of the decision, the tribunal will refer to  the
           parties by their designations in the First-tier  Tribunal.   The
           First-tier Tribunal appeals were heard very recently, barely two
           months ago.  There was  no  application  to  admit  any  further
           evidence made to the Upper Tribunal and there was no  suggestion
           even on instructions that there was any new  issue,  whether  in
           relation to either child or  any  other  matter.   The  tribunal
           accordingly considers it appropriate to remake the  decision  on
           the basis of the uncontested primary findings of fact reached by
           Judge Barker, having received the submissions set out above.


      18.   The appeals to the tribunal lie only on Article 8  ECHR  grounds
           but to determine the issue of proportionality the tribunal  must
           consider whether or not the relevant Immigration Rules are  met,
           and if not, whether  there  are  any  exceptional  circumstances
           outside the Immigration Rules which  would  render  the  refusal
           decisions or either of them disproportionate.


      19.   In the tribunal's view, applying the  Balajigari  tests  to  the
           paragraph 276B  decision,  the  First  Appellant's  conduct  was
           serious dishonesty on significant scale, involving  a  sustained
           conspiracy and deceit, for which a false account was  maintained
           until exposed at the trial.  It is immaterial that there has (at
           least so far) been no prosecution or criminal penalty.   By  any
           ordinary standard his conduct amounted to  fraud.    It  is  too
           obvious to require stating that society depends  on  the  proper
           payment of tax so as to enable a free and democratic society  to
           function, and to help it achieve its  aspirations  of  equality,
           among other matters.  The decision was reached on  discretionary
           grounds under paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   The
           Respondent's view of the First Appellant's conduct was  open  to
           it on the facts found. Those discretionary grounds  reflect  the
           legitimate objectives set out in Article 8.2 ECHR.


      20.   In the case of the First Appellant's private life, nothing above
           and beyond his work was identified in the evidence.  There is no
           exceptional  feature  and  the  decision  to  refuse  the  First
           Appellant further leave to remain on Article 8 ECHR private life
           grounds cannot be seen as disproportionate.


      21.   As to the Respondents' family life, their two children are  both
           very young and are not qualifying children.   The  second  child
           (born 27 December 2018) has  faced  congenital  medical  issues.
           The medical evidence  consisted  of  some  three  pages  in  the
           Appellants' bundle of evidence and  was  not  mentioned  in  the
           skeleton argument  placed  before  First-tier  Tribunal.   (That
           explains the brief reference in Judge  Barker's  determination.)
           Adequate specialist medical services are available  in  Pakistan
           and there was no evidence placed before the First-tier  Tribunal
           that moving back  to  Pakistan  would  compromise  the  relevant
           child's health.   The  children  have  been  brought  up  within
           Pakistani derived culture in their home and their  parents  will
           be able to induct them into life in Pakistan, where indeed  they
           will be able to continue and/or  commence  their  education  and
           practice  their  parents'  religion.   There  was  no   evidence
           suggesting that family life could not be lived satisfactorily in
           Pakistan where  the  wider  family  of  both  parents  could  be
           accessed.


      22.   The tribunal  finds  that  the  refusal  of  ILR  to  the  First
           Appellant is proportionate.  It involves no "punishment" of  the
           children or  his  wife  the  Second  Appellant.   There  was  no
           evidence that the Second Appellant has a  private  life  outside
           her  home.   She  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  First
           Appellant's dependant.  It may not be  the  family's  choice  or
           preference to return to Pakistan but there  are  no  exceptional
           circumstances and there was no  evidence  of  any  unjustifiably
           harsh consequences for the Appellants from such return.


      23.   The appeals are dismissed.


      DECISION


      The Secretary of State for the Home Department's appeal to  the  Upper
      Tribunal is allowed.


      There was a  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
      decision and reasons, which is  set  aside,  apart  from  its  primary
      findings of fact.


      The appeals are remade and are dismissed.
