	DECISION AND REMITTAL

	On 21 June 2018, I wrote to the parties as follows:



“Permission to appeal to this Tribunal has been granted in the following terms:



“I could find no arguable error of law but there appears to have been a procedural error in that the appellant’s email dated 18 February 2018 showing his English language test results and an email enclosing a copy of his English test certificate received by the Tribunal on 6 March 2018 were not put before the Judge whose decision was not promulgated until after the documents were received.”



There has been no response under rule 24.  I propose without more ado to set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law, and remit the appeal for re-determination by the First-tier Tribunal.  Any submissions to the contrary will be considered if received within 14 days of the date of this letter.”



	There has been no response adverse or otherwise.

	For the reasons given above I now set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law.  I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for the re-determination by a different judge. 





C. M. G. OCKELTON
