For the Appellant:     Ms Fisher, Counsel instructed by Maliks & Khan
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Nash, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the refusal of  entry
    clearance as a spouse under Appendix FM on the ground that  his  spouse
    is not a person present and settled here, but whose status is that of a
    dependant family member of an EEA national.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction, and I do not consider that such  a
    direction is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose date of birth is 3 March
    1987.  He applied for entry clearance as the spouse of Ms Ireana Habib,
    a Pakistani national who had been born  in  Sargodha,  Pakistan  on  26
    November 1991.

 3. Her father acquired German citizenship, and first  entered  the  United
    Kingdom in 2001.  In 2005 Ms Habib came to  join  him  as  a  dependant
    family member of an EEA national exercising treaty  rights  here.   She
    applied for a five year residence card, and she was issued with one  in
    2007.  Having accrued five years continuous residence  in  the  UK,  Ms
    Habib was issued with a permanent residence card in July 2010.  In  the
    meantime, she had married the appellant in Sargodha in  Pakistan  on  2
    April 2009.

 4. The appellant applied for entry clearance under the Immigration  Rules,
    asserting that his wife was earning in  excess  of  ï¿½18,600  per  annum
    through a combination of self-employment and salaried employment.   The
    Entry Clearance Officer did not address  himself  to  the  question  of
    whether the financial requirements of Appendix FM were met.  On 23 July
    2013 he refused the application on the sole ground that  Ms  Habib  was
    not present and settled in the UK,  in  that  her  current  immigration
    status was that she was holding a residence card as a dependant  of  an
    EEA national.  So he was refusing the application under  paragraph  EC-
    P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Rules i.e. on the basis  that  his  wife
    was not present and settled in the UK.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant's appeal came before  Judge  O'Garro  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross in the First-tier Tribunal on 2  September  2014.   Both  parties
    were legally represented.  The appellant's case on appeal was  that  he
    had submitted with his application relevant pages from his  wife's  two
    Pakistani passports.  Page 20 of passport number KF884615 contained  an
    endorsement clearly stating that his wife  had  a  permanent  residence
    card, which meant that she had no conditions on her stay in the  United
    Kingdom, and was thus present and settled in the UK for the purposes of
    the Immigration Rules.

 6. In his subsequent determination, the judge dismissed the appeal, as  he
    was satisfied that the appellant could not  succeed  under  the  Rules.
    This is because paragraph 5 of the Immigration Rules said:

         "Save where expressly indicated, these Rules do not apply to  those
         persons who are entitled to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom
         by virtue of the provisions of the 2006 EEA Regulations.   But  any
         person who is not entitled to  rely  on  the  provisions  of  those
         Regulations is covered by these Rules."

 7. The judge went on to hold that the sponsor's right  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom was governed by the EEA Regulations.  She was  a  person
    who was given the right to remain as a family member by virtue  of  the
    EEA Regulations.  The judge noted Regulation 18 which provided  that  a
    permanent residence card shall be valid for ten years from the date  of
    issue and must be renewed on application.

 8. The judge also noted that although she had a permanent right to  reside
    in the United Kingdom, her right of residency was subject to  paragraph
    19(3)(b), 20(1) or 20A(1), which gave the Secretary of State the  right
    to remove an EEA national family member from the United  Kingdom.   The
    judge drew the conclusion that until the sponsor became  a  naturalised
    British citizen, her right to reside in the United Kingdom was governed
    by the EEA Regulations and paragraph 5 of the  Rules.   This  prevented
    her from using the Immigration Rules to allow her  partner  enter  into
    the  United  Kingdom.   Unfortunately  the  EEA  Regulations  made   no
    provisions for non-EEA nationals to bring their family members into the
    UK.  So his application under the Rules must therefore fail.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 9. On 19 November 2014 First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Nicholson  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following reason:

         "Since paragraph 5 of the Immigration Rules only excludes  reliance
         on Immigration Rules by those who would be entitled to rely on  the
         EEA Regulations and since  the  evidence  indicates  the  appellant
         would not be entitled to rely on those Regulations, it follows  the
         decision by the judge  to  dismiss  the  appeal  on  the  basis  of
         paragraph 5  of  the  Immigration  Rules  was  arguably  an  error.
         Permission is therefore granted."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. At the hearing in the Upper Tribunal, I received submissions from  both
    parties as to whether the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    erroneous in law.  I was persuaded that it was,  for  reasons  which  I
    give below.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

11. The judge made contradictory findings.  On the one hand, he  recognised
    the sponsor could not avail herself of the Regulations 2006 in order to
    enable her husband to  join  her  in  the  UK.   But  paradoxically  he
    accepted the submission of the  respondent  that  paragraph  5  of  the
    Immigration Rules applied to the appellant.   This  was  illogical,  as
    paragraph 5 only excludes applicants from relying on  the  Rules  where
    they are entitled to enter or remain in the United Kingdom by virtue of
    the provisions of the 2006 EEA Regulations.  If the sponsor  could  not
    sponsor the appellant to  join  her  under  the  Regulations  2006,  it
    followed that the appellant was not entitled to enter or remain in  the
    United Kingdom by virtue of the provisions of the Regulations 2006.

12. Moreover, the reductio ad absurdum is that  a  sponsor  with  permanent
    residence status under the Regulations 2006 has less rights  than,  for
    example, a student who has only entered for a temporary  purpose  under
    the Rules.  Whereas the student can bring in a third  country  national
    spouse as a student dependant, a person  in  the  appellant's  position
    could never bring in a third country  national  spouse  despite  having
    lived in the UK for decades with permanent residency status.

13. Contrary to what the judge found, it is not necessary for  the  sponsor
    to become naturalised as a British citizen before she can  sponsor  her
    husband to join her in the UK under the Rules.  The sponsor  meets  the
    definition of "settled in the United Kingdom"  which  is  contained  in
    paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules.  Paragraph 6 provides:

         "Settled in the United Kingdom" means that the person concerned:

         (a)  is free from any restriction on the period for which  she  may
             remain ...; and

         (b)  is either:

             (i)  ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom without  having
                  entered or remained in breach of the immigration laws; or

             (ii) despite having entered  or  remained  in  breach  of  the
                  Immigration laws, has subsequently entered lawfully or has
                  been granted leave to remain and is ordinarily resident."

14. Paragraph 2 of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 provides:

         "Persons not subject to restriction on the period  for  which  they
         remain

         2(i)      for  the  purposes  of  the  1971  Act  and  the  British
             Nationality Act 1981, a person who has a  permanent  right  of
             residence under Regulation 15 shall be regarded  as  a  person
             who is in the United Kingdom without being subject  under  the
             immigration laws to any restriction on the period for which he
             may remain.

         (ii) but a qualified person,  the  family  member  of  a  qualified
             person and a family member  who  has  retained  the  right  of
             residence shall not, by virtue of that status be  so  regarded
             for those purposes."

15. Paragraph 7 of the Rules provides:

         "A person who is neither  a  British  citizen  nor  a  Commonwealth
         citizen with a right of abode nor a person who is entitled to enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom by virtue of the provisions of  the
         2006 EEA Regulations requires leave to enter the United Kingdom."

16. It is apparent from the provisions which I have cited  above  that  the
    sponsor is settled in the  United  Kingdom  for  the  purposes  of  the
    Immigration Rules, and  also  (insofar  as  it  is  material)  for  the
    purposes of the Regulations 2006.  As Judge O'Garro rightly found,  the
    appellant is not entitled to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom  by
    virtue of the provisions of the  Regulations  2006,  and  therefore  he
    requires leave to enter the United Kingdom,  which  he  can  only  seek
    under the Rules.

17. While it is true that a  person  with  permanent  residence  under  the
    Regulations 2006 can lose  that  right  in  the  extreme  circumstances
    envisaged in Regulations 19 and 20, that person's  status  is  no  more
    fragile (indeed it is arguably stronger) than  a  person  who  has  ILR
    under the Rules.

18. In short, the First-tier Tribunal  was  wrong  to  dismiss  the  appeal
    against refusal of entry clearance on the ground that the  sponsor  was
    not present and settled in the United Kingdom as required  by  Appendix
    FM.  As this was the sole issue on which the appeal  was  decided,  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal was vitiated by a material error of
    law and must be set aside.

The Remaking of the Decision

19. The appellant succeeds in his appeal on the issue raised by  the  Entry
    Clearance  Officer.   The  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    refusing his application on the ground  of  ineligibility  was  not  in
    accordance with the Rules, and was otherwise not in accordance with the
    law.

20. As  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  the  application  on  this
    preliminary ground, he did not make a decision on whether the appellant
    met the financial requirements specified in Appendix FM.   For  reasons
    of both pragmatism and  principle,  I  consider  that  the  appropriate
    course is to remit this issue  for  decision  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer as the primary decision maker.  As  a  considerable  amount  of
    time has elapsed since the application  was  made,  I  urge  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to make a  decision  on  the  financial  requirements
    within three months of the date of the promulgation of this decision.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the refusal of entry clearance to  the  appellant  was  not  in
accordance with the law, and accordingly the application is remitted to  the
Entry Clearance Officer for a lawful decision.  In view of  the  delay,  for
which the appellant is not responsible, I direct that  the  Entry  Clearance
Officer should use best endeavours to make a  decision  on  the  application
within twelve weeks of the promulgation of this decision.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In the light of my decision  to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered  whether  to  make  a  fee  award  (rule  23A
(costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005  and
section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).


I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


I make a whole fee award.


Reasons:      the appeal was necessitated by a legal error on  the  part  of
the ECO and so the appellant should not bear the cost of appealing.
