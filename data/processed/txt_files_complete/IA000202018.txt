Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Zubair Dawood, a citizen of Bangladesh born  30
       March 1994, against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
       Aujla) of 7 December 2018  to  dismiss  his  appeal,  itself  brought
       against the Respondent's decision of 8 January  2018  to  refuse  his
       application for an extension of leave to remain as a Tier 4 Migrant.


    2. The immigration history set out in the decision  below  records  that
       the Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 25 May 2013 with an entry
       clearance conferring him leave  to  enter  until  27  December  2014;
       however that leave was curtailed  to  expire  on  14  June  2014.  An
       application of 13 June 2014 was refused on 6 November  2014,  on  the
       basis that a false bank statement had been supplied in  its  support,
       and because the supporting Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for  Studies
       (CAS) was not valid. The First-tier Tribunal allowed  the  subsequent
       appeal in a decision of 21 July 2015 on the basis that there was  now
       evidence explaining the "false document" allegation, and noting  that
       the "60 day" policy (i.e. to put an application on hold in  order  to
       give an opportunity to find a new Sponsor within that period) had not
       been applied in the Appellant's favour; the  Tribunal's  decision  on
       this issue should be recognised as final.

    3. The application in this case made as long ago as 13 June 2014, though
       Mr Melvin helpfully explained that this was because  the  appeal  had
       previously been through the Tribunal  system,  with  the  consequence
       that the underlying original Home Office decision had been identified
       as not in accordance with the law, with  the  result  that  the  most
       recent  decision  had  been  issued  as  a  response  to   the   2014
       application.

    4. The background to the appeal is that the  Appellant  applied  for  an
       extension of leave, his application being supported by a  CAS  for  a
       place at London Corporate College.

    5. The application was refused in January 2018 because at  the  date  of
       decision the Sponsor was no longer on the register of  Sponsors.  The
       Appellant was well aware of this difficulty by now, not least because
       on 2 May 2017 the Respondent had written to  him,  stating  that  his
       application was being put on hold with a view to giving him  60  days
       to find a new Sponsor.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the ensuing appeal because

      a) The Appellant had now received the benefit of "60-day" policy and
         so there was no procedural unfairness in the manner in which his
         case had been considered;


      b) The Appellant had made a generic reference to human rights issues
         in the grounds of appeal but "no evidence whatsoever" had been
         provided to substantiate that claim.

    7. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal had  overlooked
       a bundle of evidence provided in relation to the Appellant's  private
       and family life in the UK. Furthermore it was said  that  the  First-
       tier Tribunal erred in law in failing to consider whether the  ruling
       in Patel should be followed given that the  Appellant  had  not  been
       given an effective opportunity to find a new  Sponsor:  the  relevant
       letter having been provided to him at  a  moment  "when  it  was  not
       reasonably and realistically open to him to ensure enrolment  with  a
       Tier 4 Sponsor" within the 60-day period.


    8. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to  appeal  on  8  January
       2019, on the basis that it appeared that the  Appellant's  ground  of
       appeal based on his private and family life in the UK  had  not  been
       determined.

    9. A Rule 24 response from the Secretary of State argued that this was a
       "new matter" that sought to raise issues that had not formed part  of
       the original application and had not  subsequently  been  considered,
       and no invitation  to  provide  a  section  120  statement  had  been
       provided; accordingly any issues of private  and  family  life  would
       have required consent from the Secretary of State for the  First-tier
       Tribunal to have jurisdiction to consider the  issue,  and  none  had
       been given.

   10. An email from Mr Shamsuzzoha (the advocate  instructed  by  Londonium
       Solicitors for the hearing before me) stated that he had  been  taken
       sick overnight and thus could not attend the hearing.  I  raised  the
       possibility of an adjournment, but in the  light  of  the  discussion
       that ensued with Mr Melvin for the Home Office,  it  became  apparent
       that a more expeditious resolution of the appeal was appropriate.

   11. Following a discussion with the bench,  Mr  Melvin  agreed  that,  on
       analysis, there had been a material failure to  consider  a  relevant
       ground of appeal and its supporting evidence. The  Rule  24  Response
       had been drafted under the misapprehension that this  was  an  appeal
       brought under the Immigration Act 2014 amendments to the  Nationality
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

  Decision and reasons

   12. Although the decision appealed against post-dates 6 April 2015, it is
       expressly not one to which  the  new  "relevant"  provisions  of  the
       Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 have application; because
       the application was made other than on human rights grounds and prior
       to 6 April 2015.  The  Immigration  Act  2014  (Commencement  No.  4,
       Transitional and Saving Provisions and Amendment) Order 2015  inserts
       Article 9(1)(c)(iv) into Commencement  Order  No.  3  such  that  the
       "saved" provisions are preserved in relation to "a decision  made  on
       or after 6th April 2015 ... to refuse an application made before  6th
       April 2015 ... to vary a person's leave to enter or remain and  where
       the result of that decision is that the person has no leave to  enter
       or remain ... unless that decision is also a refusal  of  an  asylum,
       protection or human rights claim."

   13. The instant appeal is in fact one brought under the saved  provisions
       of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 against  the  June
       2014 decision, because the application that was long put on hold  was
       made  before  April  2015  and  was  on  non-human  rights   grounds.
       Accordingly there are more grounds of appeal and potential  arguments
       available to the Appellant that would have been the case  on  a  new-
       style appeal under the "relevant provisions" of that statute.

   14. There were two  bundles  of  evidence  provided  in  support  of  the
       Appellant's appeal. It is possible that both were overlooked  by  the
       First-tier Tribunal. In any event, there is no doubt that the  bundle
       containing  the  Appellant's  witness  statement,  and  that  of  his
       partner, escaped the Tribunal's attention below.  The  Appellant  had
       stated that his family had  invested  their  entire  fortune  in  his
       studies, and all that would be lost if he was unable to complete  his
       studies in the UK. Furthermore he was now in a relationship with  his
       fianc�e Rasheeda Begum, having met her in July 2017,  and  wished  to
       rely on this as part of his private and family life ground of appeal.
       The Appellant was entitled to rely on this material  given  that  the
       grounds of appeal had  included  a  reference,  albeit  a  vague  and
       generic one, to the Human Rights Convention.

   15. As stated by Lord Carnwath in Patel [2013] UKSC 72 �37], citing Moore-
       Bick LJ (with whom Sullivan LJ agreed)  in  AS  (Afghanistan)  [2009]
       EWCA Civ 1076:


           "Having decided that the "decisions" referred to sections 85(1)
           and (2) were "immigration decisions" of the kind identified in
           section 82(1), he said at para 79:
                 '... the natural meaning of these provisions is to impose
                 on the tribunal a duty to consider matters raised by the
                 appellant insofar as they provide grounds for challenging a
                 substantive decision of a kind identified in section 82
                 that affects his immigration status. On the face of it they
                 do not restrict that duty to considering grounds that
                 relate to the reasons for that decision or to the original
                 grounds of appeal.'"


   16. Accordingly, as a human rights ground of appeal had been  raised,  it
       behoved the First-tier Tribunal to determine it.   Its failure so  to
       do is a  fundamental  error  of  law  that  undermines  its  decision
       overall.


   17. That leaves the question  of  the  ground  of  appeal  predicated  on
       whether the Home Office decision was  "not  in  accordance  with  the
       law", which is of course available  in  a  pre-Immigration  Act  2014
       appeal. I consider this argument to be hopeless and it should not  be
       allowed to proceed any further. The First-tier  Tribunal's  findings,
       to the effect that there was no material unfairness given the  policy
       had been followed, were ones to which it was well entitled  to  come.
       There is no explanation in the papers that adequately  evidences  the
       unsuccessful attempts that were made to find a Sponsor. Only the very
       clearest evidence could possibly support the submission that  it  was
       impossible to find a Sponsor in the Appellant's circumstances.

   18. The First-tier Tribunal was  entitled  to  find  that  the  Appellant
       appears to have had every opportunity to  have  found  a  Sponsor.  A
       person who cannot find a Sponsor within the relevant 60 day period is
       perfectly entitled to depart from the United Kingdom in order to make
       an entry clearance  application  in  the  future  once  they  find  a
       Sponsor. There is no requirement to remain in the UK if they  do  not
       consider that they will be able to take advantage of  the  period  in
       question.

   19. As held by the Court of Appeal in Talpada [2018] EWCA Civ 841,  there
       is  very  little  foundation  in  our  public  law  for  notions   of
       substantive rather than procedural unfairness. The  original  failure
       to give the Appellant the benefit of the 60 day policy may well  have
       been procedurally unfair, given it meant that the  potential  benefit
       of a published policy intended to benefit migrants in  his  situation
       was denied him. However the complaint in the grounds of appeal to the
       Upper Tribunal, which appears to argue that it was  not  possible  to
       obtain a Sponsor, is a complaint that the Home Office policy (or  its
       means of operation in  this  particular  case)  is  unlawful.  It  is
       difficult to see any legal basis for that submission, which as I have
       already noted, is in any event not made out on the evidence.

   20. So I do not consider that there was any material error of law in  the
       First-tier Tribunal's treatment of the unfairness ground of appeal.

   21. Nevertheless, the appeal must be remitted for the human rights ground
       of appeal to be determined.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law.
    The appeal must be re-heard.


      Signed:                                            Date:  27  February
