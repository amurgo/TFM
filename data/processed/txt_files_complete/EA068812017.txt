Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms E Rutherford, of Counsel, instructed by
                    Cartwright King   Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. This appeal comes before me following my decision of  25  September
         2018 which set aside of the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Lodge dated 8 March 2018.

      2. The appellant is a Romanian national born on 17 January  1978.  His
         application for a  registration  certificate  was  refused  by  the
         respondent under regs 17, 24 and 27 (5)(a) and  (6)(a)  because  he
         entered the UK  in  breach  of  a  deportation  order  and  it  was
         considered that  he  posed  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
         serious threat to the fundamental interests of society.

      3. The deportation order was made on  6  September  2005  following  a
         conviction for assisting illegal immigration (in 2004),  for  which
         he received a one-year prison sentence on 1 March 2005. There is no
         further official information relating to the offence or conviction,
         but the appellant's evidence is that he was  assisting  his  father
         who was travelling with him on a fake passport. No explanation  has
         been offered for why his father had a fake passport  and  there  is
         also no information as  to  whether  any  prosecution  was  brought
         against him. The appellant's evidence is that his father now  lives
         in the UK, but I have no evidence as to his immigration status.

      4. A further deportation order was issued on 21 March  2007  when  the
         appellant attempted to re-enter the UK at  Luton  Airport  and  was
         refused entry. Thereafter he entered in breach of both  deportation
         orders. In oral evidence to the First-tier Tribunal, he  maintained
         he had re-entered twice; once in 2013 in a van via France and  then
         again in 2015 via bus from Dublin. It should be noted that  in  his
         appeal form he only referred to entry in September  2015,  although
         he maintains in his witness statement that that was a  mistake.  He
         appears to have previously been in the  UK  in  2002  when  he  was
         granted leave until 21 October 2003; extended, on 21 November 2003,
         to 21 October 2006.

      5. Following his deportation in 2005, the appellant  met  and  married
         his wife in Romania. According to the appellant's wife's statement,
         he then came here in 2013 and she followed  with  the  children  in
         December 2015. On 26 October  2016,  he  made  an  application  for
         registration certificates for himself and his family. His wife  and
         two children (born 18  September  2007  and  8  August  2006)  were
         granted certificates on 19  July  2017,  but  his  application  was
         refused. It was his appeal against this decision which was heard by
         the First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodge in Birmingham on 2  March  2018
         that gives rise to these proceedings.

      6. The First-tier Tribunal's decision was set aside on the basis  that
         the judge's proportionality assessment of  the  appellant's  family
         circumstances, and specifically  the  best  interests  of  his  two
         daughters, was inadequate for the purposes of reg. 27(5).

      7. The following findings  were  preserved:  (1)  that  the  appellant
         knowingly entered in breach of one or more deportation  orders  (2)
         that he deliberately failed  to  disclose  his  conviction  on  his
         application for a registration certificate.

      8. The appeal then came before me for re-hearing on 24 January 2019.







         The Hearing

      9. The appellant and his wife attended the  hearing.  Both  gave  oral
         evidence. The appellant spoke through a  Romanian  interpreter  and
         his wife gave evidence in English with the interpreter available in
         case of need.

     10. The appellant confirmed the contents of his witness  statement  and
         stated that his removal from the  UK  would  adversely  affect  his
         children. They did not want to return, nor did  they  want  him  to
         leave. It had been difficult when he had left them in  Romania  and
         come to the UK; he had not been around  to  offer  them  help  with
         their education or to have any input as a father. He confirmed that
         he had been offered work by a  company  owned  by  his  mother  and
         brother.

     11. In cross examination the appellant confirmed that his  brother  had
         registered the business in July 2018. They were  currently  working
         on a contract from Mears Housing. His position was  still  open  as
         the company needed more workers. He had previously worked in the UK
         as a carpenter. His wife worked  as  a  cleaner.  She  earned  some
         �10,000 p.a. cleaning offices and homes. Apart from that  they  had
         help from friends and family, but he could not say  how  much.  Nor
         did he know what they paid in bills. The rent was �920  per  month.
         He did not keep count of money. They also received benefits and the
         costs of the rent was largely met  by  housing  benefit  leaving  a
         shortfall of �200. He denied that he  was  working.  He  could  not
         offer any explanation  for  why  his  wife  and  children  did  not
         accompany him in 2013, given the stated difficulties of separation.
         He did not agree that there had been a significant impact upon  the
         children when they arrived here. He stated that most family members
         were here. He said that the children liked  the  school.  They  had
         support to communicate when they started. With respect to his older
         daughter's school results, he said his wife would know  better.  He
         did not recall any friends coming to their house in the first year.
         The children spoke Romanian and English. They would be  12  and  13
         this year. The youngest was due to start secondary school the  next
         academic year.  He disagreed that they were not at a critical stage
         in their education.

     12. The appellant was asked about family in Romania.  He  said  he  had
         cousins and an uncle there but had not  been  in  touch  with  them
         whilst in Romania and there was no contact since he had come  here.
         He did not keep in touch with friends as they were  all  here.  The
         children did not wish to keep in touch  with  their  friends  after
         they came here. He said his brother was here with his daughters and
         they had friends here too. His wife's brother and mother  lived  in
         Romania although her mother was currently visiting  them.  She  and
         the children were not that close. He had some land in  Romania.  It
         could be built on, but he did not use it for anything. He  did  not
         agree that there would be no  great  problems  for  the  family  on
         return to Romania. He said that  it  would  be  difficult  for  the
         children to adapt. That completed cross examination. There  was  no
         re-examination.

     13. In response to my questions, the appellant stated that the children
         had attended pre-school in Romania from the  age  of  2  or  3  and
         school from around 6. His brother, his wife and their children were
         in the UK along with his mother, three cousins, one of whom  had  a
         family and a lot of friends. They were part  of  a  large  Romanian
         community. His father was also here.

     14. I asked the appellant to describe an average day in  his  life.  He
         said it was boring. He did nothing. He  wanted  to  work.  I  asked
         about his role in the household. He stated that he washed  clothes,
         cleaned and washed the dishes  when  required.  His  wife  did  the
         cooking. They shared the shopping. His wife took  the  children  to
         school on her way to work. They came home walking,  or  his  mother
         collected them, or he did. He said they went  for  walks  together,
         went swimming and talked. He said he would stop  claiming  benefits
         if he was able to work but  then  admitted  that  he  had  been  on
         benefits when working previously. His brother employed five people.
         The employment had been self-employed  when  he  had  last  worked.
         Evidence had been adduced. Neither party had any questions  arising
         from mine.

     15. I then heard from the appellant's wife, FEA. She was able  to  give
         her evidence in  English.  She  confirmed  she  was  aware  of  the
         contents of her witness statement. She said that she had spoken  to
         her eldest daughter about the situation and her daughter  had  said
         that if she was made to leave the UK it would mean that her  mother
         did not care about her. She said that the children had grown up  in
         Romania and had been all right there but since being here they were
         able to compare the situation and that they preferred  being  here.
         She, herself, would have to choose between staying  here  with  her
         children or returning with her husband. She  said  remaining  would
         not be a good situation as it would be difficult to manage  on  her
         own. She would have to work and care for  the  children.  She  said
         that her husband helped with cleaning  and  cooking  at  home.  The
         children needed a father. They listened to him more  than  to  her;
         perhaps that was because she was always at work. They needed  their
         father.

     16. In re-examination, FEA stated that  they  did  not  come  with  the
         appellant in 2013 because they did not have the money to do so  and
         he had come here to organise things and to prepare  for  them.  She
         agreed that it was difficult for them at  first  as  they  did  not
         speak English and they had to use Google Translate, but they learnt
         fast and now spoke very  well.  They  liked  school  and  had  made
         friends. They had initially kept in touch with friends in  Romania,
         but they were young and lost contact after a while.

     17. The witness said that she  worked  as  a  cleaner.  She  worked  in
         private houses during the day and  then  in  the  evenings  cleaned
         offices. However, she was an agronomic  engineer  by  training  and
         would like to find work in that area. Initially she had not had any
         hope because of her lack of English but that had improved since she
         had been working and speaking to her employers and colleagues.  She
         stated that her husband had been working but stopped  when  he  had
         been told not to by the Home Office. She said that she  made  about
         �400 per month from her evening work and around �800 per month from
         her day time job although that varied according to her hours.  Over
         summer, when people were on holiday, she provided cover and so  was
         able to earn more. She said when  they  needed  extra  money,  they
         borrowed from friends and family. She could not say how much.

     18. When asked about the differences between Romania and  the  UK,  she
         said the education system was better  here.  There  was  a  lot  of
         theory in Romania and hours of homework. Additionally, there was no
         thought given to the ability of students and to whether they  could
         or could not follow the lessons. She said that  school  trips  were
         organised here.  She said that her mother lived in Romania but  was
         here visiting at the moment. She also had a brother, but he  was  a
         truck driver and often driving all over Europe. The  children  were
         not very close to her mother as  she  had  worked  when  they  were
         young, and she had lived a distance away. They had a small piece of
         land in Romania. There was no re-examination.

     19. In answer to my questions, the witness stated that the schools here
         were more geared to understanding the needs of the children and her
         daughters had targets set according to their ability.  They  had  a
         good social life with parties, visits to  friends  and  family  and
         going to the park. The children were now able to go  into  town  on
         their own  and  they  had  bank  cards.  They  were  taught  to  be
         independent in school. They were aware that they  had  rights.  She
         said that she worked from 9 until 3 and then from 4.45 until 7. Her
         husband cooked, did  the  cleaning,  collected  the  children  from
         school and took them out. She would sometimes take the children  to
         school, otherwise her husband did. They usually had to borrow money
         every month. They  received  child  and  working  tax  credits  and
         housing benefit. Neither party had any questions arising  and  that
         completed the oral evidence.

     20. I then heard submissions.

     21. Mr Clarke submitted that the appellant's breach of two  deportation
         orders and his continued presence in the UK was an ongoing  offence
         and a matter which  should  be  considered  as  being  against  the
         fundamental interests of society for the purposes  of  reg.  27(5).
         Such conduct was treated as an on-going offence under s.24(1)(a) of
         the Immigration Act 1971. It fell within the terms of 7(a) and  (f)
         of Schedule 1 of reg.  27.  Furthermore,  the  work  the  applicant
         undertook during  the  time  of  his  illegal  residence  was  also
         unlawful and in contravention of reg. 24(b). It did not assist that
         he claimed to have stopped working in 2016 as he had already  known
         that he was here in breach of the deportation orders  against  him.
         Mr Clarke also urged me to find that the appellant's claim to  have
         stopped working was not credible. Had it been true, he argued  that
         the appellant would be fully aware of the household budget as money
         was tight. It was submitted that given  the  appellant's  continued
         presence in the UK in breach of the orders,  his  failure  to  seek
         revocation of the orders from overseas and the preserved  findings,
         he  posed  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
         affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.

     22. Mr Clarke then took me through the factors I needed to consider. He
         submitted that the appellant was 39 years old, neither he  nor  any
         of his  family  members  had  any  health  issues,  their  economic
         situation was not great as they claimed to be short  of  funds  and
         his wife had a better job  when  they  had  been  in  Romania.  The
         appellant had also had work there. The family were on  benefits  in
         the UK. The  length  of  residence  was  short  for  the  wife  and
         children, just three years, and much of his residence was unlawful.
         There was no permanent right to residence. Little weight  could  be
         given to integration which had  taken  place  at  a  time  when  an
         offence had been committed.   He submitted that the  appellant  had
         spent over 30 years in Romania. He had some land there and  he  and
         his wife had family. his wife and children had lived  there.  There
         were considerable links with the country of origin. Mr  Clarke  did
         not seek to go behind the social worker's report but submitted that
         it did not say anything more than one would  expect.  The  children
         could not speak English when they arrived, and it took a  year  for
         them to begin to get the hang of it which left just two  years  for
         integration. Their difficulties at  school  showed  the  extent  of
         their ties to Romania when they came here. It had taken a  year  to
         begin to adjust. Whilst the report spoke about the benefits of  the
         education system, there was no attempt at balancing  the  situation
         and  no  acknowledgment  of  how  their  best  interests  had  been
         interrupted by coming to the UK and the difficulties the faced. Nor
         was there any consideration of resuming life in Romania.   However,
         as they and their mother were entitled to be here,  the  issue  for
         the Tribunal was to consider whether it was proportionate  for  the
         family to remain here without the appellant  or  for  them  all  to
         return to Romania. Mr Clarke submitted that in  both  scenarios  it
         was proportionate, and the appeal should be dismissed.

     23. Ms Rutherford replied. She submitted that if I were  to  find  that
         there was a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to one
         of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society  then  the  issue   of
         proportionality had to be considered. However, she  submitted  that
         there was no such threat. The appellant's conviction dated back  to
         2005. It was the only one. Whilst  it  was  accepted  that  he  had
         entered in breach of the deportation  order,  there  was  no  other
         criminal behaviour. He had settled  down  and  married.  He  was  a
         family man. His entry in breach of the deportation  order  was  not
         enough to warrant a finding against the  fundamental  interests  of
         society. It was not sufficient  to  just  have  a  conviction;  the
         appellant had to also pose a current threat. The appellant had been
         previously working in the UK and paying taxes. There was nothing to
         suggest that he had been working after being told to stop.  He  and
         his wife had not been able to put a figure on  the  money  borrowed
         from friends and relatives as there was no set amount borrowed.  He
         had been reporting as required. There was evidence  of  his  wife's
         work and evidence had been given as to  how  the  family  supported
         itself.

     24. On the issue of  proportionality,  the  focus  had  to  be  on  the
         children. They had been here since December 2015 and  whilst  three
         years may not be much for an adult, it was a  long  time  in  their
         lives. They had adapted well after  initial  difficulties  and  had
         worked hard to progress at school. The school reports  referred  to
         were from July 2016, not long after they had arrived here,  and  it
         was to be expected that they would have been having difficulties at
         that time. Those problems had now gone, and the  girls  were  doing
         well. They no longer had any ties with Romania and it was in  their
         best interests for them to  remain  here  with  both  parents.  The
         social worker's report discussed the situation of a separation from
         their father. Their  mother  would  find  it  difficult  to  manage
         without him as she would  have  to  cope  with  working,  with  the
         housework and with childcare. The family had  links  to  the  local
         community, they had family here, the appellant had the potential to
         work and ties  with  Romania  were  weak.  After  ten  years  of  a
         deportation order, it was normal  to  consider  setting  it  aside.
         Given the time that had passed  and  the  strength  of  the  family
         circumstances, deportation was not proportionate.

     25. That completed submissions. At the conclusion  of  the  hearing,  I
         reserved my determination which I now give with reasons.

     26. Discussion and Conclusions

     27. I have considered all the evidence before me and have had regard to
         the submissions made. I reach my decision  having  taken  all  that
         before me into account and having  considered  the  evidence  as  a
         whole.

     28. Regulation 24(1) permits the Secretary of State to refuse to issue,
         revoke or refuse to renew a registration  certificate  if  this  is
         justified on grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
         health. In reaching his decision, the Secretary of State had regard
         to reg. 27(5) and (6):

             '27-       (5)   The  public  policy   and   public   security
                  requirements of the  United  Kingdom  include  restricting
                  rights otherwise conferred by these Regulations  in  order
                  to protect the fundamental interests of society, and where
                  a relevant decision is taken on grounds of  public  policy
                  or public security it must also  be  taken  in  accordance
                  with the following principles-

                      (a)   the decision must comply with the principle  of
                           proportionality;

                      (b)   the decision must be based exclusively  on  the
                           personal conduct of the person concerned;

                      (c)    the  personal  conduct  of  the  person   must
                           represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
                           serious threat affecting one of  the  fundamental
                           interests of society, taking  into  account  past
                           conduct of the person and that  the  threat  does
                           not need to be imminent;

                      (d)   matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the
                           case or which relate to considerations of general
                           prevention do not justify the decision;

                      (e)   a person's previous criminal convictions do not
                           in themselves justify the decision;

                      (f)   the  decision  may  be  taken  on  preventative
                           grounds,  even  in  the  absence  of  a  previous
                           criminal conviction,  provided  the  grounds  are
                           specific to the person.

                  (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the  grounds  of
                  public policy and public security in relation to a  person
                  ("P") who is resident in the United Kingdom, the  decision
                  maker must take account of considerations such as the age,
                  state of health, family and economic situation of  P,  P's
                  length of residence in the United Kingdom, P's social  and
                  cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
                  extent of P's links with P's country of origin.'

         Schedule 1 of Regulation 27 CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, PUBLIC
         SECURITY AND THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY ETC., states:

             '...

             Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom

             2.  An EEA national or the family member of  an  EEA  national
             having extensive familial and societal links with  persons  of
             the  same  nationality  or  language  does   not   amount   to
             integration in the United Kingdom;  a  significant  degree  of
             wider cultural and societal integration must be present before
             a person may be regarded as integrated in the United Kingdom.

             3.  Where an EEA national or  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
             national has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent
             offender, the longer the sentence, or the  more  numerous  the
             convictions, the greater the likelihood that the  individual's
             continued presence in the United Kingdom represents a genuine,
             present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  of  the
             fundamental interests of society.

             4.  Little weight is to be attached to the integration  of  an
             EEA national or the family member of an  EEA  national  within
             the United Kingdom  if  the  alleged  integrating  links  were
             formed at or around the same time as-

                  (a)  the commission of a criminal offence;

                  (b)  an act otherwise affecting the fundamental  interests
                  of society;

                  ...

             5.  The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national  or
             the family member of an EEA national who is  able  to  provide
             substantive  evidence  of  not  demonstrating  a  threat  (for
             example, through demonstrating that the EEA  national  or  the
             family member of an EEA national has successfully reformed  or
             rehabilitated) is less likely to be proportionate.

             6.  It is consistent with public policy  and  public  security
             requirements in the United Kingdom that EEA decisions  may  be
             taken in order to refuse,  terminate  or  withdraw  any  right
             otherwise conferred by these Regulations in the case of  abuse
             of rights or fraud, including-

                  (a)  entering, attempting to enter  or  assisting  another
                  person to enter or to attempt to enter, a marriage,  civil
                  partnership or durable partnership of convenience; or

                  (b)  fraudulently obtaining or attempting  to  obtain,  or
                  assisting another to obtain or to  attempt  to  obtain,  a
                  right to reside under these Regulations.

             The fundamental interests of society

             7.  For the purposes of  these  Regulations,  the  fundamental
             interests of society in the United Kingdom include-

                  (a)  preventing unlawful  immigration  and  abuse  of  the
                  immigration  laws,  and  maintaining  the  integrity   and
                  effectiveness of the immigration control system (including
                  under these Regulations) and of the Common Travel Area;

                  ...

                  (f)  excluding or  removing  an  EEA  national  or  family
                  member of an EEA national  with  a  conviction  (including
                  where the conduct of that person is likely  to  cause,  or
                  has in fact caused, public offence) and maintaining public
                  confidence in the ability of the relevant  authorities  to
                  take such action;

                  ...'

     29. The facts are largely undisputed. The appellant has not shown  that
         he has acquired rights of  permanent  residence  and,  indeed,  any
         residence post deportation has been  unlawful  because  it  was  in
         breach of the two orders issued against him. He  has  a  conviction
         for assisting  with  illegal  entry  and  despite  giving  him  the
         opportunity to submit any evidence relating to  the  offence,  none
         has been forthcoming. I  have,  however,  seen  evidence  from  the
         respondent to  confirm  the  offence  and  the  custodial  sentence
         received in 2005. The appellant married his Romanian wife  in  2006
         and they have two daughters aged eleven  and  twelve.   Both  girls
         attend local schools. The appellant's  wife  works  as  a  cleaner.
         During school hours she cleans private homes and  in  the  evenings
         she cleans offices for two hours.  She  is  a  qualified  agronomic
         engineer and in Romania was able to work in her area of  expertise.
         The appellant had also worked in Romania. Here, he had worked as  a
         carpenter (although there was  disagreement  over  whether  he  was
         still working). The family received various benefits in the UK. The
         appellant's mother, brother and brother's family  were  in  the  UK
         along with uncles, cousins and many friends. The appellant's wife's
         mother and brother live in Romania. The appellant has some land  in
         Romania which can be built on. They live in rented accommodation in
         High Wycombe and their rent is largely paid by housing benefits.

     30. The parties agree that  I  am  required  to  consider  whether  the
         decision taken by the respondent conforms with reg. 27(5) and  (6).
         Essentially, I must consider whether  the  appellant  represents  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
         the fundamental interests of society and if so whether the decision
         complies with the principles of proportionality and whether all the
         relevant factors (set out in 27(6)) have been taken into account.

     31. The respondent's case is that the appellant does present a genuine,
         present and sufficiently serious  threat  affecting  a  fundamental
         interest of society, i.e. the prevention of  unlawful  immigration,
         the abuse of  the  immigration  laws  and  the  maintenance  of  an
         effective  immigration  control  system.  It  was  argued  for  the
         respondent  that  the  appellant's  re-entry  in  breach   of   two
         deportation orders and his continued presence in the UK was an  on-
         going offence and, having carefully considered the evidence and the
         submissions, I have to concur with  that.  I  set  my  reasons  out
         below.

     32. I am satisfied that the appellant's conviction occurred  almost  14
         years ago and I bear in mind that a conviction in itself  does  not
         justify a decision  to  deport.  However,  it  is  the  appellant's
         subsequent and on-going conduct that is relevant to the  assessment
         of whether he presents a threat and it is that I now consider.

     33. The appellant entered the UK in breach of two  deportation  orders.
         The previous judge found that he knowingly and deceitfully  did  so
         by using a circuitous route to enter on two occasions after he  had
         been refused entry at an airport as the subject  of  a  deportation
         order.  That finding has been preserved. It is, therefore, the case
         that when the appellant last  entered  the  UK  and  when  he  made
         applications for registration  certificates  for  himself  and  his
         family (who had joined him in December 2015), he knew that  he  had
         entered unlawfully. When his application was refused for that  very
         reason, he did not acknowledge his wrong doing, return  to  Romania
         and seek a revocation of the deportation order in the proper way as
         he  should  have  done,  but  remained  here  in  defiance  of  the
         deportation order and filed this appeal.

     34. Additionally, when he applied for the registration certificate,  he
         did  not  disclose  to  the  respondent  that  he  had  a  previous
         conviction. Indeed, he declared on  his  application  that  he  had
         never  been  convicted  of  any  crimes.  It  would  be  difficult,
         therefore, for me to find that the  appellant's  conduct  does  not
         represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the
         prevention of unlawful immigration and the abuse of the law. By his
         continued residence in defiance of deportation he  has  shown  only
         contempt for the laws of this country. His lack of remorse for  his
         actions and  his  refusal  to  acknowledge  his  wrong  doing  only
         reinforces his willingness to continue to abuse UK immigration laws
         and does little to maintain  the  integrity  and  effectiveness  of
         immigration control. I take note of the fact that  similar  conduct
         under the Immigration Act of 1971 is considered to be  an  offence:
         s.24(1)(a). Had he sought to have the deportation order  set  aside
         in Romania, as he should have done, he  may  well  have  succeeded,
         given the passage  of  time  and  what  would  then  have  been  an
         unblemished history since his conviction. Regrettably, he chose  to
         unlawfully re-enter, bring in his wife and two  children  and  then
         attempt to regularise his stay without declaring his past  history.
         His evidence to the First-tier Tribunal Judge that he  had  friends
         here who had been deported but had stayed, only goes  to  reinforce
         his lack of respect for British immigration laws.

     35.  I  was  addressed  by  both  parties  on  the  issue  of  unlawful
         employment. Mr  Clarke  noted  the  complete  inability  of  either
         witness to give any kind of detail as to the monies they  allegedly
         borrowed on a monthly basis from friends and family. His submission
         was that if money had been so tight, and if  only  the  appellant's
         wife was working, then they would have been able to state how  much
         they had to borrow. Ms Rutherford argued that there was no evidence
         to suggest that the appellant had worked after he was told to  stop
         in 2016 and that the reason that neither the appellant or his  wife
         could state how much they borrowed was because there was  no  fixed
         sum. I have considered both sets of submissions. Contrary  to  what
         Ms Rutherford submitted, however, the appellant's own evidence does
         indicate that he worked after 2016. When he lodged his appeal  form
         at the end of July 2017, he maintained that he last entered the  UK
         in September 2015 "and since then I have continued to  work  as  SE
         (self-employed) in the UK". If the appellant had ceased working  in
         2016, there is no reason why he would say this a year later. I note
         that although the appellant later sought to correct  that  date  of
         his entry by way of a witness statement, there was no correction of
         his claim to have worked since that time.

     36. I also have regard to the letter dated 9  February  2018  from  the
         appellant's representatives written to the Immigration  Enforcement
         team. In that letter it is maintained that  the  appellant  entered
         the UK in 2012 "and has been... working here since then". The claim
         of continued  work  is  repeated  within  the  letter  and  further
         supports the allegation that the appellant has  continued  to  work
         after 2016. There would certainly be no reason for the  appellant's
         own representatives to misrepresent the position for their  client.
         There are also unexplained  large  deposits  into  the  appellant's
         account throughout 2017 at a time when he  claims  he  was  not  in
         employment. These are separate from the  benefits  which  are  also
         shown going into his  account  and  do  not  tally  with  the  oral
         evidence that money was borrowed on a monthly basis.

     37. I also find force in  Mr  Clarke's  submissions.  It  is  just  not
         credible that the appellant and his wife  could  be  so  completely
         ignorant of what they had to borrow every month in  order  to  make
         ends meet. They were not even able to  provide  a  rough  estimate.
         Neither could give any sum at all.  If  money  was  borrowed  every
         month, it would have been quite straightforward to give  some  idea
         of the amount involved. I accept the amount could well have varied,
         as Ms Rutherford submitted,  but  that  does  not  explain  why  no
         details whatsoever  were  forthcoming.  Furthermore,  the  evidence
         given by the appellant and his wife as to  his  activities  in  the
         home was  inconsistent.  The  appellant  said  his  wife  took  the
         children to school, she said that he usually did and that she  only
         did sometimes if she had a house to clean nearby. He said  she  did
         the cooking. She said he did. He said, when pushed for more details
         of his role at home, that he washed the  dishes  when  needed.  She
         said he did all the cleaning. He said he did nothing at home and it
         was "boring" whereas if he had been doing  all  the  housework  and
         cooking as his wife claimed, he would not be  doing  "nothing".  No
         attempt to reconcile this inconsistent evidence was made and  I  am
         left without any  explanation  as  to  why  there  should  be  such
         divergencies between the evidence on basic everyday  matters.  This
         only serves to raise doubt over what the appellant actually does to
         occupy himself and lends weight to Mr Clarke's submission  that  he
         is working. On the evidence  before  me,  therefore,  and  for  the
         reasons given above, I conclude that the appellant has continued to
         work unlawfully.

     38. Having found, therefore, that the appellant does represent a threat
         to the fundamental interests of society  pursuant  to  reg.  27(5),
         because  his  conduct  does  not  demonstrate  a  respect  for  the
         immigration  laws   and   indeed   displays   disregard   for   the
         effectiveness of immigration control, I now  consider  whether  the
         decision was proportionately made in the context  of  the  relevant
         factors listed at 27(6).

     39. The appellant was born on 17 January 1978 and  has  therefore  just
         turned 39. He has many working years ahead of him and the  evidence
         is that he was employed in Romania prior  to  entry.  He  has  also
         worked in the UK as a carpenter. He appears to be fit and well. His
         wife works here as a cleaner and worked in Romania as an  agronomic
         engineer. According to the appellant's  evidence,  their  financial
         situation here is not good. Whilst they  have  contributed  to  the
         economy by paying modest taxes, they have  also  heavily  drawn  on
         state resources by claiming a variety of benefits. The  appellant's
         evidence was that they had done so  even  when  he  was  previously
         working which does not suggest that the family would cease claiming
         benefits if the appellant were to go back to work (assuming  he  is
         not currently working).  If he is working as I have found, then  he
         is doing so without paying tax and national insurance.

     40. The evidence of the appellant and his wife was that  they  struggle
         to the extent that they have to borrow money every  month  although
         they were unable to give any indication of how much and there is no
         evidence to confirm this. There was no suggestion that they were in
         debt or struggled financially in Romania.

     41. The appellant's length of residence here is unclear  but  certainly
         any re-entry since 2005 has been unlawful. The appellant's wife and
         children joined him in December 2015 and so  have  been  here  just
         over three years. That is a relatively short period of  time,  even
         taking account of Ms Rutherford's submission that it is a long time
         in the lives of the children. On the other hand, both the appellant
         and his wife, and indeed the children, have spent the  majority  of
         their lives in Romania. If three years is a  long  time,  then  the
         time spent in Romania is far longer and would mean much more to the
         children. The appellant's wife stated in evidence  that  when  they
         were there, life was fine and the children did not complain. It  is
         only now, having been here and being able to compare the  different
         life styles, that they have expressed a  wish  to  remain  here.  I
         accept that the children have now adjusted to life and school  here
         after what must clearly have been a difficult first year when  they
         were unable to communicate and had to learn English. It is to their
         credit that they did so and that they made good progress at school.
         I accept they have made  friends  although  no  evidence  from  any
         friends from school has been adduced. I note that whilst the family
         have relatives here, there  are  also  relatives  in  Romania.  The
         appellant has land in Romania. He owns no property here. The family
         live in rented accommodation. They appear to have  moved  at  least
         once since the arrival of the children. No issues  of  health  have
         been raised in respect of the appellant, his wife or children.

     42. I take account of  the  social  worker's  report,  the  letters  of
         support from friends and family, the school  reports,  evidence  of
         work and all the other evidence submitted in support of the  appeal
         when assessing the factors at 27(6).

     43. Contrary to what is argued by the appellant  in  evidence  and  his
         wife (in her witness statement), I find that the children  are  not
         at crucial stages of their education. Both are  still  very  young.
         The older child has not yet started her path to  taking  GCSEs  and
         the younger one is not yet at secondary school. It  was  said  that
         they liked the education system here better because they  had  less
         homework, school outings and more practical rather than theoretical
         work but these just constitute personal preference  and  are  minor
         matters. The children are still very young. They have been  in  the
         UK for around a third - a quarter of their  lives  and  speak  both
         Romanian and English. Their involvement in the community, as indeed
         that of their parents, appears to be largely restricted to Romanian
         family and friends. All  the  supporting  letters  are  from  other
         Romanians and all friendships referred to in the evidence relate to
         the children  of  Romanian  friends.  The  evidence  pertaining  to
         outings, parties and socialising focuses on the Romanian community.
         This is relevant because "having extensive  familial  and  societal
         links with persons of the same nationality  or  language  does  not
         amount to integration" under the Regulations (s. 2 of schedule  1).
         There is no evidence before me of any links  outside  the  Romanian
         community. I am,  therefore,  unable  to  find,  on  the  available
         evidence, that the appellant and his family  have  integrated  into
         British society.

     44. Of course, in any event, "little weight is to be  attached  to  the
         integration of an EEA national or  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
         national within the UK if the alleged integrating links were formed
         at or around the same time  as...an  act  otherwise  affecting  the
         fundamental interests of society" (sch. 1: 4). So  even  if  I  had
         found there was integration, which  I  have  not  for  the  reasons
         above, it would carry little weight because the appellant has  been
         here unlawfully in breach of a deportation order.

     45. The report of the social worker was based on an acceptance that the
         appellant played a  substantial  role  in  the  upbringing  of  the
         children and in supporting his wife. This does not accord with  the
         diverging evidence I heard from the appellant and his  wife  as  to
         his input into household and family matters. It  is  also  at  odds
         with the appellant's unsatisfactory evidence at the  hearing  where
         he knew nothing about how the children were  doing  at  school  and
         said his wife would know and where he claimed  to  not  recall  any
         friends coming to the house in direct contradiction to  his  wife's
         evidence that friends came and even slept over.  I also  note  that
         whilst his evidence was that the children did not keep contact with
         their friends in Romania after leaving,  his  wife's  evidence  was
         that  they  did  and  that  gradually  contact  came  to  an   end.
         Nevertheless, whatever his involvement or lack of involvement  with
         the lives of the children, I accept that they would  prefer  to  be
         with both parents and that they would prefer to continue living  in
         the UK with them. Their position and wishes are matters I take into
         account, but they are not a trump card.

     46. Plainly the family have several options; that of  accompanying  the
         appellant to Romania or of remaining here  without  him.  There  is
         also the possibility of him  making  an  application  to  have  his
         deportation order revoked and then re- joining the family.

     47. The appellant's wife and children have  lived  apart  before.  They
         were assisted by other family members in  Romania  and  indeed  the
         appellant's wife's witness statement indicates  that  the  children
         stayed with their grandparents whilst she travelled back and  forth
         between the UK and Romania. Should the family decide to stay  here,
         they would be able to  make  the  relatively  short  trip  over  to
         Romania to visit the appellant from time to time and would be  able
         to make use of modern  means  of  communication  in  the  meantime.
         Whilst I accept that this would cause  disruption,  as  the  social
         worker's report maintains, they did live apart before and  although
         the report purports to consider difficulties faced by the  children
         whilst separated from their father, it also finds  that  these  may
         have been exacerbated by the trauma of having to  fit  into  a  new
         society. It is unclear what period the social worker  is  referring
         to here as  the  separation  from  the  appellant  was  whilst  the
         children were still in Romania. The report also, of  course,  deals
         with the separation on the premise that it would be permanent. That
         need not be the case. There is a large family here to assist and  I
         do not accept the appellant's wife's evidence that she  would  have
         to manage on her own with the children were the appellant to leave.
         It is plain that she would have a number of family members to  turn
         to for help.

     48. I find that the appellant and his wife brought the children to  the
         UK knowing that he was the subject of  a  deportation  order.  They
         must take part of the responsibility for any disruption  to  family
         life as it is their actions that have placed  the  family  in  this
         position. I fully accept that the children are innocent victims  in
         this situation and I do have sympathy for them and fully understand
         that they do not want more disruption in their lives. However,  the
         separation may not be long and they would be able to  have  contact
         by various means in the meantime.

     49. Should the family decide to return to Romania with the appellant, I
         accept there would be some need to adjust. However, they would  not
         be returning to an alien  environment.  They  have  retained  their
         Romanian identity despite what the  social  worker  states  in  her
         report and, as I have pointed out above, the vast majority of their
         socialising is within the Romanian community. To that extent,  they
         retain the culture and identity of their country of  origin.  I  do
         not understand what the social worker means when  she  talks  about
         the children having adopted the culture here because I am not  told
         in what way it differs from  Romania  where  it  seems  to  me  the
         appellant and his family had a similar life style.

     50. The children are not a crucial stage in their  education  and  they
         have experience of schooling in Romania (from the age of two). They
         have, of course, spent more years in Romania and  in  school  there
         than they have here. The adjustment to life there would be less  of
         a trauma than it was coming here. I  note  the  appellant's  wife's
         evidence that the children have  said  they  are  not  happy  about
         returning but they are minors and  it  is  not  for  them  to  make
         decisions about the future of the family. I see no reason why their
         best interests would be compromised by returning with both  parents
         to a country where they spent the larger part of  their  lives  and
         where they still have family. It was not claimed by either  witness
         that they would have no place to live.

     51. For all the reasons given, I therefore conclude  that,  much  as  I
         sympathise with the position  of  the  appellant's  daughters,  the
         decision to refuse the appellant's application under  reg.  27  (5)
         and (6)  was  proportionately  made.  I  find  that  his  continued
         residence in breach of the deportation order against him is an  on-
         going offence  and  that  it  represents  a  genuine,  present  and
         sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
         interests of society.

     52. Decision

     53. The appeal is dismissed.




     54. Anonymity

     55. I continue the anonymity order made by the First-tier Tribunal.
