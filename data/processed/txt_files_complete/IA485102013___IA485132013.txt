Representation:

For the respondent: Ms Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the appellants: Mr Collins


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The first appellant is a citizen of Lithuania and the  second  appellant
   is his  Ukrainian  wife.  On  28  September  2013  they  applied  for  a
   registration certificate and a residence card respectively on the  basis
   that the first appellant was an EEA national exercising  treaty  rights.
   The applications were refused under regulation 20(1) of the  Immigration
   (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the  regulations").  That
   reads:

       The Secretary of State may refuse to issue, revoke or refuse to renew
       a registration certificate [or] a residence card... if the refusal or
       revocation is justified on grounds of public policy, public  security
       or public health.

2. The Secretary of State justified the decision in the light of the  first
   appellant's criminal activity between 2005 and  2012.  The  trial  judge
   concluded that the first appellant did represent a genuine, present  and
   sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the  fundamental  interests
   of society. It is not disputed that the second appellant's appeal stands
   or falls with that of her husband.

3. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Clive Lane  who
   said the First-tier Tribunal had arguably failed to demonstrate a proper
   understanding of the regulations. I conclude that the  Tribunal  did  so
   fail. This is a case where the first appellant, because of his residence
   in this country (over five years) is entitled to  the  second  grade  of
   protection,  "serious  grounds"   and  arguably  the  highest  level  of
   protection "imperative grounds". It follows that the Tribunal fell  into
   legal error and I propose to remake the decision.

4. I turn to the facts which are not substantially in dispute; the case was
   heard on the papers and at neither hearing was there live evidence.  The
   first appellant came to this country on 28 October  2001  and  has  been
   residing here since then. It has not been disputed that, apart from when
   in prison, he was exercising treaty rights. His mother  and  sister  are
   settled here and have lived here since 2002. His sister is  married  and
   has two children who are British  citizens.   He  married  his  wife  in
   November 2012 and she came to this country in September 2013. They  have
   a daughter who was born on 2  March  2014.  The  appellant  works  as  a
   carpenter and has recently bought a house in which  he  lives  with  his
   family. His gross profits for the year 2012/13 were �27,510 and his  net
   profits were �15, 750.

5.  I turn to the appellant's criminal record. I cannot find  any  document
   on the file dealing with this so I take  the record from the  First-tier
   Tribunal which  has  not  been  doubted.  In  February  2005  the  first
   appellant was convicted of assaulting  a  constable,  driving  over  the
   limit and driving uninsured. He received a community  punishment  order.
   In March 2006 he was again convicted of an excess  alcohol  offence  and
   fined and disqualified. In April of the same year he  was  convicted  of
   driving whilst disqualified and given a five months' suspended sentence.

6. In May 2008 at the  Crown  Court  he  pleaded  guilty  to  a  number  of
   offences. He obtained a false passport, in order  to  obtain  a  driving
   licence which he needed in order to work. He  was  sentenced  to  twelve
   months imprisonment for that. The passport was then used  in  connection
   with a   fraud which involved (as far as one  can  see,  the  sentencing
   remarks assume a knowledge of what had gone on) an e-bay internet fraud.
   For this the first appellant received a fourteen month  prison  sentence
   consecutive to the  twelve  months.   It  appears  from  the  sentencing
   remarks that the judge considered  that  the  appellant  had  been  very
   cooperative. It appears that the serious part  of  this  offending  took
   place in December 2007. Finally he was convicted of criminal damage  and
   failure to surrender in April 2012. He was fined. Apart from the  matter
   referred to earlier in this paragraph all the other matters  were  dealt
   with in the Magistrates Court.

7. The appellant can only be removed on serious grounds of   public  policy
   because he has resided here in accordance with the regulations for  five
   yeatrs  and  that  privilege  is  not   lost   because   of   subsequent
   imprisonment. In any event it would appear that he has resided here  for
   a further five years since he was released from prison.

8. The principles that I must apply are to be found in  paragraphs  21  (5)
   and (6) of the regulations. In particular I must be satisfied that  that
   the first appellant  represents  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
   serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.

9. I would make one general remark. The first appellant is now married with
   a child and a mortgage; while such matters do  not  rule  out  offending
   they do lessen the risk. With regard to  the  motoring  offences,  I  do
   consider these serious matters. Driving whilst over the  limit,  without
   insurance and whilst disqualified (and it would  appear  without  having
   passed a driving test) puts members of the public at a serious risk. One
   of the fundamental interests of society is not to have drunken uninsured
   drivers loose  on  the  road.  However,  the  first  appellant  has  not
   committed any offences of this sort for over eight years and  I  do  not
   think that there is now a real risk that he might  commit  further  such
   offences.

10. I turn to the offences for which the first appellant  was  sentenced  to
   twenty-six months' imprisonment.  These were committed about seven years
   ago, and from reading the sentencing remarks, it is clear  that  a  much
   more sophisticated person was the brains behind  the  offences.  Whilst,
   again, the offences affect one of the fundamental interests of  society,
   I do not think that  there is now, a real risk that the first  appellant
   will commit such offences. I would add that had I so  thought,  I  would
   have  concluded  that  there  were  serious  grounds  of  public  policy
   involved.

11. Assessment of risk  is  always  difficult  and  there  can  never  be  a
   certainty that there will be no further offending. However, on any basis
   here risk is at the lower end of the scale and  the first  appellant  is
   highly integrated in  this  society,  As  Blake  J  says  in  Essa  (EEA
   rehabilitation/integration) [2013] UKUT 00316  (IAC)  such  factors  are
   likely to be a relevant positive factor in the  proportionality  balance
   as to whether removal is justified. The balance of all the factors  here
   points to removal not being justified.

12. I turn to the situation if  the  first  appellant  is  entitled  to  the
   privileges of someone who has resided here for ten years  in  accordance
   with the regulations; such a person can be removed only  on  "imperative
   grounds" and I am in no doubt that what we have here do  not  amount  to
   such grounds. Here the appellant has resided here in accordance with the
   regulations but that period was interrupted by  the  time  he  spent  in
   prison.The matter is  dealt  with  in  MG  (prison-Article  28(3)(a)  of
   Citizens Directive) Portugal [2014] UKUT 003393  (IAC).  The  head  note
   reads:

       (1)  Article  28(3)(a)  of    Directive   2004/38/EC   contains   the
          requirement that for those who have resided  in  the  host  member
          state for the previous  ten  years,  an  expulsion  decision  made
          against them  must  be  based  on  imperative  grounds  of  public
          security.


       (2) There is a tension in the judgment of the Court of Justice of the
          European Communities in the case C-400/12 Secretary of State v  MG
          in respect of the meaning of the  "enhanced protection" provision.


       (3) The  judgment  should  be  read  as  meaning  that  a  period  of
          imprisonment during those 10 years does not necessarily prevent  a
          person from qualifying for enhanced protection if that  person  is
          sufficiently integrated. However, according to the same  judgment,
          a period of imprisonment must have a negative  impact  insofar  as
          establishing integration is concerned.


13.  (3)  in  the  previous  paragraph   must  be  taken   as  meaning  that
   integration is a question of fact, but imprisonment  will  be  a  matter
   that may well mitigate against  the establishment of  integration.  Here
   the first appellant has been in this country for thirteen years and  has
   been in prison for  thirteen  months.  He  has  always  worked  and  has
   purchased a house. He has relatives in this country.  There  is  nothing
   to suggest that the period of imprisonment has had a negative effect  on
   his integration.  I  conclude  that  he  is  entitled  to  the  enhanced
   protection that comes with   ten years residence in accordance with  the
   regulations.

14.  It follows that the original determination did contain an error of  law
   and I substitute a decision allowing the appeal.

The appeal is accordingly allowed
