Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Sowerby, Counsel instructed by Pasha Law

For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a national  of  Pakistan  who  was  born  on  19
    October 1980.  The second appellant is his wife who is also a  national
    of Pakistan.  The couple have a child.  The second  appellant's  appeal
    is dependent on the first appellant's; she has no independent claim.

 2. The appellants appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge T
    Lawrence, who in a decision signed on  27  June  2019  and  promulgated
    shortly thereafter following a hearing at Taylor House on 10 June  2019
    dismissed the appellants'  appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision
    dated 5 February 2019 in which the respondent had refused to grant them
    leave to remain.  The basis of refusal,  it  being  accepted  that  the
    appellants would otherwise have been entitled to leave to remain  under
    the Rules, was on suitability grounds, because (as set out at paragraph
    32 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal):

         "The applicant has made false representations or failed to disclose
         any material fact in a previous application  for  entry  clearance,
         leave to enter, leave to remain or a variation of leave,  or  in  a
         previous human rights claim; or did so in order to obtain from  the
         Secretary of State or a third party a document required to  support
         such an application or claim (whether or  not  the  application  or
         claim was successful)".

 3. The short facts in this case are that  there  was  a  huge  discrepancy
    between the returns made by the first appellant to HM Revenue & Customs
    in 2010/11 and also in 2012/13 and the income that he  had  claimed  in
    respect of these periods when seeking further leave  to  remain.   When
    seeking further leave to remain he had declared to UKVI a self-employed
    net profit of �29,850 for the period  from  15  September  2009  to  14
    September 2010 and in his next application for further leave  a  profit
    of �26,808 for the period 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.  By  contrast,
    when making his revenue returns, for the year 2010/11 he had declared a
    net profit of only �1,300 and for the tax year  2012/13  on  his  self-
    assessment return to HMRC he had declared a net profit of nothing.   Of
    course, on each of his tax returns he had signed a declaration  to  the
    effect that these returns were truthful and correct.

 4.  There  was  a  discrepancy  in  the  explanations  given   for   these
    inconsistencies, but the most recent explanation which he had given  to
    Judge Lawrence has been set out  by  Judge  Lawrence  at  paragraph  15
    within his decision.  At paragraph 12 of his decision,  Judge  Lawrence
    sets out the different accounts given as follows:

         "12. ... the  questionnaire  dated  12  June  2018  had  given  the
             appellant  the  opportunity  to  explain  the  correction   or
             resubmission of his declarations of earnings for the tax years
             2010/11 and 2012/13, which he had stated were that he had  not
             understood the business inputs and outgoings.  He now gave the
             explanation that he had needed to delay the payment of tax  in
             order to pay for his father's medical treatment  in  Pakistan,
             which was inconsistent to that  earlier  explanation  and  was
             unsupported by evidence".

 5. The judge then went on to refer to the decision of the Court of  Appeal
    in Balajigari & Ors v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673  and  noted  that  as  a
    result of the appellant having offered no adequate explanation for  the
    discrepancy between the earnings declared  to  HMRC  and  to  the  Home
    Office the respondent had concluded that these discrepancies were as  a
    result of dishonesty.

 6. As is very common in similar cases where discrepancies have arisen, the
    first appellant has subsequently paid the tax which he should have paid
    earlier but  as  was  made  very  clear  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Balajigari, that does not and would  not  excuse  dishonesty  when  the
    original returns were made.  What the court in that case  (which  arose
    out of judicial review hearings in which in general  an  applicant  has
    not been given an opportunity to have  his  evidence  tested)  is  that
    where Article 8 decisions turn  on  the  honesty  or  otherwise  of  an
    applicant, that applicant should be given an opportunity  to  have  his
    explanation  (and  in  particular  whether  or  not  what  he  did  was
    dishonest) tested in a court environment.  That is of course  precisely
    what happened in this case.

 7. In his very careful and thorough decision,  Judge  Lawrence  considered
    the explanation given by this appellant very carefully indeed.   It  is
    only necessary to refer to a part of  these  findings.   In  the  first
    place the judge concluded that he could not even accept the explanation
    given for why the false returns were made, because it was  inconsistent
    with the explanation he had earlier given (see at paragraph 22  of  his
    decision).  Further, as also noted at paragraph 22:

         "There is also the absence of evidence that the appellant's amended
         declarations of earnings are genuine, or that he paid money towards
         his father's medical treatment; he has made assertions of the  same
         in his witness  statement  and  oral  evidence,  and  there  is  no
         suggestion that  HMRC  considers  the  appellant  to  have  falsely
         inflated his earnings in the amended declarations, but there is  no
         evidence from other sources of the  father's  treatment,  of  money
         transfers from the appellant to fund  the  treatment,  nor  of  the
         appellant's earnings during the relevant periods".

 8. This was a finding open to the judge on the evidence.

 9. Moreover, in any event, the  suggestion  that  seems  to  be  contained
    within  the  grounds  (although  not  further  argued  on   the   first
    appellant's behalf by his Counsel, who did not  settle  these  grounds)
    that somehow no deception was involved in making what on any view it is
    now accepted were false returns and that the  appellant  had  not  been
    exercising deception is simply unarguable.  What  the  first  appellant
    says now is that at a time when he  was  earning  respectively  �29,850
    (September 2009 to September 2010) and �26,880  (1  April  2012  to  31
    March  2013)  he  was  not  attempting  to  deceive  anyone  or  acting
    dishonestly  by  making  declarations  to  the  HMRC   of   income   of
    respectively �1,300 and nothing, thereby in his words delaying  (rather
    than avoiding forever) his liability to pay significant sums of tax  in
    respect  of  these  periods  at  the  times  when  that  tax  was  due.
    Furthermore, he signed a declaration that the figures that he gave were
    truthful, knowing this not to be the case.  It is not possible to argue
    that this was anything other than dishonest; while somebody who  steals
    a loaf of bread in order to feed his family is on any common sense view
    less culpable than somebody who goes shoplifting in general for his own
    gratification, it cannot be said that signing  declarations  of  income
    known to be false can be anything other than dishonest.  When one  adds
    to this the finding by the judge that the first appellant has not  even
    established to the appropriate level of proof that his explanation  for
    his dishonesty was as he now claims (that it was in order to  fund  his
    father's medical treatment in Pakistan) there is no  basis  upon  which
    his appeal could possibly have succeeded.  As the Court of Appeal  made
    very  clear  in  Balajigari  it  will  normally  be  appropriate  where
    dishonest  revenue  returns  have  been  established   to   refuse   an
    application for further leave on character grounds.

10. It follows that this appeal is one which is devoid of merit.  There  is
    no error of law in Judge Lawrence's  very  careful  decision  and  this
    appeal must accordingly be dismissed.

11. I have given this decision orally immediately following the hearing and
    just before concluding I was informed by Mr Sowerby, representing  both
    appellants that a separate appeal, that of the  second  appellant,  had
    been linked.  This was because for reasons that are not entirely  clear
    but which were dealt with by Upper Tribunal Judge Blundell when  giving
    permission to appeal, the second appellant's appeal had not been linked
    with that of her husband but had been decided separately by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones QC.  For reasons  that  are  not  entirely
    clear that judge considered that even if  the  first  appellant's  case
    succeeded, there would be no insurmountable  obstacles  preventing  the
    second appellant from returning to Pakistan,  and  indeed  her  husband
    could return there with her together with their child.  Judge  Blundell
    when giving permission considered that it was at  least  arguable  that
    that decision contained material errors of law (with which I agree) but
    because I have decided above that the first appellant's  appeal  cannot
    succeed in any event, it is not  necessary  for  me  to  consider  this
    independent point.   The second appellant's appeal could  only  succeed
    on the basis that her husband was entitled to remain, and as he is not,
    neither is she.  Accordingly, my decision is as follows:

12. The first appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
