                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Jamaica born in 1967.  He  appeals  with
    permission[1] against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Lea)  to  dismiss  his  appeal  against   decisions   to   refuse   him
    international protection and to refuse to grant him leave to remain  on
    human rights grounds. The Respondent made those decisions  in  response
    to representations from the  Appellant  about  why  he  should  not  be
    deported.




    Anonymity


 2. The Appellant is a foreign criminal and as such there is no reason  why
    he should benefit from an order  protecting  his  identity.  This  case
    however turns on the presence in the United Kingdom of the  Appellant's
    three British children. Having had regard to Rule 14  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  the  Presidential  Guidance
    Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I am concerned that  identification
    of the Appellant could lead to identification of his children and  this
    would be contrary to their best interests.   I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"



    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The pertinent chronology is as follows:


    1997         The Appellant claims that he was refused entry on  arrival
    but he
                  was landed and granted temporary admission for one day. He


                  failed to report to the airport and remained in the United


                  Kingdom without leave.


    29.6.11      The Appellant is apprehended during a police road stop. He
                 gives a false identity and claims to be a national  of  the
                 Bahamas. He is detained.


    13.7.11      The Appellant claims asylum asserting that he had suffered
                 serious harm in Jamaica for reasons of his membership of  a
                 particular social group, namely gay men.


    18.2.13      The Respondent refuses asylum on credibility grounds,  but
                 additionally on the basis that the  Appellant  could  avail
                 himself of the protection of the Bahamas, since on his  own
                 evidence he appears to be a dual national.


    20.6.13      The Respondent withdraws her decision to refuse asylum.


    13.5.14      The Appellant is convicted at Manchester  Crown  Court  of
                 five separate offences. For two of  those  offences  he  is
                 sentenced to a total consecutive sentence of 54  months  in
                 prison:


      Possession with intent to supply cocaine - 12 months
      Possession with intent to supply heroin - 42 months


      The remaining three sentences were to served concurrently:


      Assault with intent to resist arrest - 6 months
      Possessing false identity document - 6 months
      Possession with intent to supply cocaine - 12 months


    24.6.14      The Respondent informs the Appellant of his  liability  to
                 automatic deportation and issues a 'one-stop warning'.


    4.9.14 The Appellant asserts that he should not be deported because  he
                 requires international  protection  (refugee  grounds)  and
                 because he has a partner and  children  in  the  UK  (human
                 rights grounds).


    30.12.15     The Respondent notifies the Appellant that she has decided
                 to make a deportation order.


      The Appellant is interviewed and makes further representations.


    20.2.17      The Deportation Order is signed.


    21.2.17      'Reasons for refusal' letter served




 4. There were two planks of  the  Appellant's  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.


 5. First, he contended that his removal would be contrary to  the  Refugee
    Convention because he faced a real risk of persecution in  Jamaica  for
    reasons of his sexuality. He maintained that he is gay/bisexual, and/or
    perceived as such in Jamaica, that he has suffered persecution  because
    of this in the past and that he would do so again.   His  status  as  a
    "serial criminal" prevented him from recognition as a  refugee  but  he
    sought to rebut the presumption in s72 of the  Nationality  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 that he remains a danger to the  community  in  the
    UK. Alternatively, he relied on Article 3 ECHR.

 6. In respect of the second limb of the case the Appellant submitted  that
    he had a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with his children
    in the UK and that his removal would have such an adverse  impact  upon
    them so as to violate the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR.
    By virtue of paragraphs 398-399 of the Immigration Rules the  Appellant
    was here required to show not only that  the  impact  on  the  children
    would be "unduly harsh", but because of his length  of  sentence,  that
    there were in his case "exceptional circumstances over and above"  that
    already high test.  In granting permission Judge  Froom  considered  it
    arguable that the Tribunal had erred in  its  approach  to  this  limb:
    "[The Judge] has not made the necessary findings. This  is  arguably  a
    serious error. It may be that the outcome would be the  same  were  the
    Tribunal to apply the correct approach in view of  the  length  of  the
    appellant's sentence, but the appellant is entitled to  have  his  case
    assessed on the correct statutory basis".

 7. Before  me  Mr  Diwnycz  conceded  that  Judge  Froom  was  right.  The
    determination contains no structured findings on a) the  best  interest
    of the Appellant's children b) whether it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
    expect those children to live without their father in  the  UK  and  c)
    whether there are compelling features of the case over and above  there
    being an unduly harsh impact on the children. Given that those were the
    key findings that the Judge was required to make it  follows  that  the
    determination is defective.

 8. This Appellant undoubtedly faces a high hurdle in establishing his case
    under Article 8. The weight  of  the  public  interest,  where  he  has
    received a custodial sentence in excess of four years,  is  substantial
    indeed; it adds to the already great weight to be attached to  removing
    persons with no right to remain  under  the  Immigration  Rules.  I  am
    however satisfied that the Secretary of State for the Home Department's
    concession is properly made. As Judge Froom puts it, the  Appellant  is
    entitled to have his case assessed on the correct statutory basis.    I
    am further  satisfied  that  the  determination  contains  unclear  and
    contradictory findings in respect of the first limb of the  Appellant's
    case, in particular in respect  of  whether  he  is  gay/bisexual.  The
    determination rejects this contention at [�38], then at  [�39]  rejects
    the evidence that  the  Appellant  is  now  in  a  stable  heterosexual
    relationship because of the evidence that he is bisexual. As Mr Diwnycz
    put it, that is arguably eating cake, and having it at the  same  time.
    The parties were therefore in agreement that the matter be remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal for hearing de novo.





    Decisions and Directions


 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  errors  of  law  such
    that the decision must be set aside.


10. The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

11. There is an order for anonymity.
