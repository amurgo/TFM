                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellants:          Mr Wilding of Counsel instructed by Makka
Solicitors Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nepal born on the 28th December 1988. He
    seeks entry clearance to the United Kingdom on  human  rights  grounds;
    specifically he wishes to join his mother Mrs Lila Devi Khan, the widow
    of a former Gurkha soldier now settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    application for entry clearance was refused in  a  decision  dated  the
    28th March 2019.




 2. The Appellant's appeal against that decision came before the First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Seelhoff) on the 31st January 2020.   By  his  decision
    promulgated on the 7th  February  2020  Judge  Seelhoff  dismissed  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.  He concluded that the Appellant  could
    meet the requirements of Annex K of the Immigration Rules.  Insofar  as
    the Appellant relied on Article 8 'outside of the rules' Judge Seelhoff
    did not consider that a family life existed nor  accordingly  that  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance was disproportionate.


 3. The Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Permission was granted by the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Neville)  on
    the 28th April 2020.


    The First-tier Tribunal Decision

 4. That the Appellant could not meet any requirement  of  the  Immigration
    Rules was not in issue. It was plainly  accepted  that  he  could  not,
    since those rules do not provide for entry as  the  adult  child  of  a
    Gurkha widow. That, properly, was the starting point for the First-tier
    Tribunal's enquiry.


 5. The Tribunal proceeded to consider Article 8 'outside  of  the  rules'.
    The first matter  was  to  consider  whether  Article  8  was  engaged.
    Applying R (on the application of Razgar) v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2004] UKHL 27 that involved making  a  finding  as  to
    whether the Appellant, by then a 31 year-old man, shared a family  life
    with his widowed mother.    The Tribunal directed itself [at  ï¿½8]  that
    there is "extensive case law on Gurkha cases", indicating that  it  was
    familiar with that jurisprudence and  that  it  would  have  particular
    regard to Annex K  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the  decisions  in
    Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003]  EWCA  Civ
    31 and  Jitendra Rai v Entry Clearance Officer (New Delhi) EWCA Civ 320
    [2017].

 6. Its findings on the  facts  were  as  follows.  The  Tribunal  was  not
    satisfied that the Appellant's mother, referred to hereinafter  as  the
    sponsor, had come up to proof. She had been unable to  answer  many  of
    the questions put to her by the Judge  (the  Respondent  had  not  been
    present at the hearing)  and  was  confused  about  her  son's  current
    circumstances. For that reason the Tribunal could not be satisfied that
    those circumstances  are  as  they  had  been  claimed  to  be  in  the
    application. The evidence indicated that the Appellant lives in a place
    called Butwal with his two brothers and one of this brother's wife  and
    children. This is not the same  place  as  his  mother  lived,  or  the
    village where she claims he now resides: Shankarnagar.  The Appellant's
    brother Bijaye works and so it is far from  clear  whether  the  Gurkha
    army pension is the main source of income for the family. The Appellant
    himself has a degree  and  although  his  claim  to  have  always  been
    unemployed is supported by a certificate from the  local  committee  in
    Shankarnagar, this is not based in Butwal, where he says that he lives:
    the Judge notes that this "discrepancy in the evidence  does  leave  me
    with questions". "Crucial" bank statements are  missing,  covering  the
    period around the application.   Having had  regard  to  all  of  those
    matters, the Tribunal was not satisfied that there was  a  family  life
    between the Appellant and his mother.


 7. The Tribunal to proceeded to consider, in the alternative, whether  the
    decision to refuse to grant entry clearance would  be  disproportionate
    if family life was established.   It found there to  be  a  distinction
    between this case and the vast majority of other  Gurkha  cases,  where
    "the person being separated from their family is a Gurkha to  whom  the
    UK owes a debt". It went on:


         "The fact that widows are not  entitled  to  sponsor  their  family
         members under the policy must be intended to reflect the fact  that
         widows are a step removed from the historic injustice when compared
         to Gurkhas themselves. It is a conscious decision on  the  part  of
         the Secretary of State to exclude Gurkha widows from being able  to
         sponsor adult children. I consider that that must reflect a  belief
         that  the  circumstances  are  fundamentally   different.   In   my
         assessment it does not follow that the Appellant and his mother are
         in the context of this case prejudiced by the historic injustice as
         alleged".




    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

 8. Of the four grounds advanced in the grounds (drafted by Mr  Jesuram  of
    Counsel) Mr McVeety was able to indicate that the  Respondent  did  not
    oppose two.


 9.  The  first  uncontested  ground  relates  to  the  adverse   inference
    apparently drawn by the  Tribunal  from  the  discrepancy  between  the
    address given as 'Butwal' and also as 'Shankarnagar".   As a matter  of
    fact, I accept that Shankarnagar is a village  close  to  the  town  of
    Butwal and that it is commonly known by that association, Butwal  being
    the  administrative  and  postal  district.  There  is   therefore   no
    discrepancy at all  in  the  descriptions  of  where  the  family  home
    actually is. The error of law in the Tribunal assuming otherwise  could
    be framed in any one of three ways, and each is made out:

     a)  an error of fact leading to material unfairness;


     b)  a  failure  to  take  material  evidence  into  account,  viz  the
        explanation offered in a letter from Tilottama Municipality  Office
        explaining that village addresses in Nepal have since a  government
        decree in 2014 been subsumed  by  their  municipality  and  so  two
        different addresses can in fact relate to the same place;

     c) unfairness in that the point was not taken by the Respondent -  had
        the judge wishes to hear an explanation for  the  'discrepancy'  he
        should  have  alerted  the  Appellant  (or  on  this  occasion  his
        representatives or Sponsor) to his concern and given an opportunity
        for them to respond.


10. The second ground accepted as made out by  Mr  McVeety  for  the  Entry
    Clearance is this. There was absolutely no basis in law for the Judge's
    conclusion that none of the jurisprudence on the  'historic  injustice'
    faced by Gurkha families was relevant to  this  family.  The  Appellant
    asserts that his Gurkha father would have settled in this  country  had
    he had the opportunity to do so upon his  discharge  from  the  British
    Army. Had he done so his  wife  would  have  accompanied  him  and  his
    children would have been British, as they would have been born here  to
    settled parents.   That is the  injustice  that  the  courts,  and  Her
    Majesty's government, have sought to redress, and that is so whether or
    not his father is still alive. The First-tier Tribunal erred in finding
    otherwise.


11. I now turn to the grounds that remained in contention before me.

12. Mr Wilding submitted that in its assessment of whether  a  family  life
    existed between mother and  son  for  the  purpose  of  Article  8  the
    Tribunal has erred in two interrelated respects. First it  is  apparent
    from the reasoning overall that the Tribunal has erred in  focusing  on
    whether the Appellant is dependent upon his mother:  as  the  Court  of
    Appeal made clear in Rai (supra) the question is not one of dependency,
    but rather whether one gives the other  real,  effective  or  committed
    support.  The second error is in the Tribunal's focus on whether or not
    this is a dependency of necessity:  that the Appellant could  work,  or
    could be supported by other means was not relevant if  in  fact  he  is
    supported by his mother.

13. The relevant jurisprudence is comprehensively reviewed in Rai:
      1. In Kugathas v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department [2003]
         EWCA Civ 31, Sedley L.J. said (in paragraph  17  of  his  judgment)
         that "if dependency is read  down  as  meaning  "support",  in  the
         personal  sense,  and  if  one   adds,   echoing   the   Strasbourg
         jurisprudence, "real" or "committed" or  "effective"  to  the  word
         "support", then it represents ... the irreducible minimum  of  what
         family life implies". Arden L.J.  said  (in  paragraph  24  of  her
         judgment) that the "relevant factors ...  include  identifying  who
         are the near relatives of the appellant, the nature  of  the  links
         between them and the appellant, the age of the appellant, where and
         with whom he has resided in the past, and the forms of  contact  he
         has maintained with the other members of the family  with  whom  he
         claims to have a family life". She acknowledged (at  paragraph  25)
         that "there is no presumption of family life". Thus "a family  life
         is not established between an adult child and his surviving  parent
         or  other  siblings  unless  something  more  exists  than   normal
         emotional ties". She added that "[such] ties  might  exist  if  the
         appellant were dependent on his family or vice versa", but it  was
         "not ... essential that the members of the family should be in  the
         same country". In Patel and  others  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer,
         Mumbai [2010] EWCA Civ 17, Sedley L.J. said (in paragraph 14 of his
         judgment, with which Longmore and Aikens L.JJ. agreed)  that  "what
         may constitute an extant family  life  falls  well  short  of  what
         constitutes dependency, and a good  many  adult  children  ...  may
         still have a family life with parents who are now settled here  not
         by leave or by force of circumstance but by long-delayed right".
      1. In Ghising (family life  -  adults  -  Gurkha  policy) the  Upper
         Tribunal accepted (in paragraph 56 of its determination)  that  the
         judgments in Kugathas had been "interpreted too restrictively  in
         the past and ought to be read in the light of subsequent  decisions
         of the domestic and Strasbourg courts", and (in paragraph 60)  that
         "some of the [Strasbourg] Court's decisions  indicate  that  family
         life between adult children and  parents  will  readily  be  found,
         without evidence of exceptional dependence". It went on to say  (in
         paragraph 61):
         "61. Recently, the [European Court of Human  Rights]  has  reviewed
         the case law, in [AA v United Kingdom [2012] Imm. A.R.1],  finding
         that a significant factor will be whether or not  the  adult  child
         has founded a family of his own. If he is still single  and  living
         with his parents, he is likely to  enjoy  family  life  with  them.
         ...".
         The Upper Tribunal set out the  relevant  passage  in  the  court's
         judgment in AA v United Kingdom (in paragraphs 46 to  49),  which
         ended with this (in paragraph 49):
         "49. An examination of the Court's case-law would tend  to  suggest
         that the applicant, a young adult of 24 years old, who resides with
         his mother and has not yet founded a family  of  his  own,  can  be
         regarded as having "family life"."
      1. Ultimately, as Lord Dyson M.R. emphasized when giving the  judgment
         of the court in Gurung (at paragraph 45), "the question whether an
         individual enjoys family life is one  of  fact  and  depends  on  a
         careful consideration of all the relevant facts of  the  particular
         case". In some instances "an adult child (particularly if  he  does
         not have a partner or children of his own) may  establish  that  he
         has a family life with his parents". As Lord Dyson M.R. said, "[it]
         all depends  on  the  facts".  The  court  expressly  endorsed  (at
         paragraph 46), as "useful" and as indicating "the correct  approach
         to be  adopted",  the  Upper  Tribunal's  review  of  the  relevant
         jurisprudence  in  paragraphs  50  to  62  of   its   determination
         in Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy),  including  its
         observation (at paragraph 62) that  "[the]  different  outcomes  in
         cases with superficially similar features emphasises to us that the
         issue under Article 8(1) is highly fact-sensitive".
      1. To similar effect were these observations of  Sir  Stanley  Burnton
         in Singh v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA
         Civ 630 (in paragraph 24 of his judgment):
         "24. I do not think that the judgments to  which  I  have  referred
         lead to any difficulty  in  determining  the  correct  approach  to
         Article 8 in cases involving adult children. In the case of adults,
         in the context of immigration control, there is no legal or factual
         presumption as to the existence or absence of family life  for  the
         purposes of Article 8.  I  point  out  that  the  approach  of  the
         European   Commission   for   Human   Rights   cited    approvingly
         in Kugathas did not include any requirement of exceptionality. It
         all depends on the facts. The love and affection between  an  adult
         and his parents or siblings will not of itself justify a finding of
         a family life. There has to be something more. A young adult living
         with his parents or siblings will normally have a family life to be
         respected under Article 8. A child enjoying a family life with  his
         parents does not suddenly cease to have a family life  at  midnight
         as he turns 18 years of age. On  the  other  hand,  a  young  adult
         living independently of his parents may well not have a family life
         for the purposes of Article 8."


14. From theses authorities the Court drew two conclusions relevant to  the
    First-tier  Tribunal's  enquiry.  First,   that   Kugathas   has   been
    restrictively  read  and  in  fact  there  exists  no  requirement   of
    'exceptionality' when considering the family life shared between  adult
    children and their parents. Second, that the language  of  'dependency'
    is unnecessary. What matters is whether the adult child  derives  real,
    committed or effective support from his parents. This could be  in  the
    form of financial,  or  emotional  support.   I  therefore  accept  the
    submission that the Tribunal here erred in apparently misconstruing the
    meaning of Rai:   although the authority is cited in the  decision,  it
    does not appear to have been applied.


15. The final point made on the Appellant's behalf is this. The decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal is largely focused on the claims  of  financial
    support. In  fact  that  was  not  the  totality  of  the  case.    The
    uncontested evidence was that the Appellant and Sponsor are very  close
    and that they speak every day. A statement from a third party,  Basanti
    Rana, set out how much mother misses son, how she cannot sleep  because
    she is separated from her children and how Ms Rana  has  seen  her  cry
    when speaking with him. This was important evidence going to  the  bond
    between the two, and it does not  feature  at  all  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's reasoning.  The error being a failure to  consider  material
    evidence, it is made out.

16. The Appellant having satisfied  me  that  the  decision  contains  four
    material errors I set it  aside  in  its  entirety.   In  view  of  the
    findings of fact that need to now be re-made I consider that  the  most
    appropriate forum for that would be in the First-tier Tribunal.


    Decisions

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error of law.


18. The appeal is to be heard de novo in the First-tier Tribunal by a Judge
    other than Judge Seelhoff.

19. There is no anonymity order.
