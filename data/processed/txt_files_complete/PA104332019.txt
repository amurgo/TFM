Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Greer instructed by Bankfield Heath Solicitors.

For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Kelly ('the Judge') promulgated on 11 September 2020
        in which the Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal.
     2. Permission to appeal was refused by another judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal but granted on a renewed  application  by  Upper  Tribunal
        Judge Grubb on 10 November 2020, the operative part  of  the  grant
        being in the following terms:


        2.   The judge accepted that  the  appellant  had  previously  been
             persecuted in Bangladesh because  of  his  pro-Hindu  writings
             (para 30) but found that he would not do so again if  returned
             to Bangladesh (para 31).


        3.   It is arguable that the judge's reasons were inadequate. It is
             arguable that, having found the appellant  to  be  a  truthful
             witness and accepted the  past  persecution,  the  judge  gave
             inadequate reasons for finding  that  the  appellant  had  not
             established that he would continue to publish in Bangladesh or
             that, if he did not do so, it  would  be  out  of  a  fear  of
             persecution. It would appear to be  no  answer  to  his  claim
             that, as the judge found at para 32, he could  avoid  harm  by
             taking up his earlier merchant seamen career.


        4.         For these reasons, permission to appeal is granted.



Background


     3. The Judge sets out findings of fact from [22] of the decision under
        challenge in which it is noted it was not understood the respondent
        was suggesting that it was implausible for members  of  the  Muslim
        majority in Bangladesh to attack a member of a  religious  minority
        for publishing a supposed religious insult.
     4. At [30] the Judge writes:


        30.  Having reviewed the various strands of the evidence in detail,
             I have stood back and considered it  in  the  round,  weighing
             those features that tell both for and against the  appellant's
             credibility. I have therefore concluded that there is at least
             a reasonable degree of likelihood  that  his  account  of  the
             events leading  to  his  departure  from  Bangladesh  and  his
             subsequent conversion to Christianity is a truthful  one  (the
             latter claim not in any  event  being  disputed  by  Mr  Hunt-
             Jackson  at  the  hearing).  I  shall  therefore  conduct   my
             assessment  of  the  risk  to  the  appellant  on  return   to
             Bangladesh on this basis.


     5. The Judges risk assessment is set out between  [31  -  34]  in  the
        following terms:


        31.  I should perhaps make clear from the  outset  that,  whilst  I
             have accepted the appellant's account of the primary facts,  I
             do not accept his claim (made during his re-examination by  Mr
             Greer) that he, (a) would continue  to  publish  materials  in
             defence of the Hindu community on return to Bangladesh but for
             the  risk  of  harm  he  would  thereby  face   from   Islamic
             Fundamentalists, and/or (b) would have published such material
             whilst in the United  Kingdom  but  for  fear  that  he  would
             thereby jeopardise the safety of his family in  Bangladesh.  I
             do not accept that claim  for  the  following  combination  of
             reasons. Firstly, and most obviously, he does not suggest that
             the reach of those he fears on return to Bangladesh extends to
             the United Kingdom. There was thus nothing to prevent him from
             publishing such material in the UK had he genuinely wished  to
             do so. Secondly, his family in Bangladesh  have  disowned  him
             for the very reason that they wish to disassociate  themselves
             from his views. Thirdly, he has now converted from Hinduism to
             Christianity. Fourthly, the appellant only made this claim  at
             a very late stage in his evidence. It is, in my  judgement,  a
             claim that it is reasonable to expect he would have made at  a
             much earlier stage of  the  proceedings  had  there  been  any
             substance to it. I am so satisfied that  the  reason  why  the
             appellant has not published such material whilst in the  UK  -
             and why he would not do  so  on  return  to  Bangladesh  -  is
             because he has simply lost interest in the subject  matter  of
             the  book  that  caused  him  to  be   attacked   by   Islamic
             fundamentalists whilst in Bangladesh. I am thus satisfied that
             fear of any consequential increase in the risk  of  him  being
             subjected to religious persecution is not (and would not be) a
             contributory factor in  him  choosing  to  refrain  from  such
             activity upon return to Bangladesh.


        32.  In the opinion of Dr Daryn, the appellant should  have  little
             difficulty in securing a suitable position were he  to  resume
             his career as a merchant seaman in Bangladesh. Moreover, as Dr
             Daryn also points out, this would solve any difficulty that he
             may otherwise face in seeking to relocate on the mainland (see
             paragraph  46  of  his  report).  When  Mr  Hunt-Jackson   the
             appellant why he could  not  take  this  step  to  avoid  this
             claimed fear of those who had ill treated him in the past,  he
             responded by saying that it could take up  to  six  months  to
             secure a position on a ship and that his  fear  was  of  being
             located and  harmed  during  that  period.  I  have  therefore
             assessed the  objective  risk  of  persecution  on  return  to
             Bangladesh on this basis.


        33.  In his careful and balanced report,  Dr  Daryn  says  this  at
        paragraph 53 of his report -


             I have little doubt that  the  ABT,  JI  and  Hefazat-e-Islam,
             despite  the  first  two  being   banned/persecuted   by   the
             authorities in Bangladesh, have sufficient financial and other
             means that will allow them to find out about the return of any
             of their enemies and execute a suitable  punishment.  However,
             it is rather questionable whether the ABT  and  JI  are  still
             looking for the Appellant at present, now that he has  stopped
             publishing pro-Hindu ("un-Islamic") books.


        34.  Given the above, I am not satisfied that there is a real  risk
             that the appellant would be traced  and  harmed  by  those  in
             respect of whom, I accept, he has a subjective fear.  For  the
             avoidance of doubt, I am not satisfied that there  is  a  real
             risk of this happening in either the limited period of up to 6
             months he would be residing on mainland Bangladesh or at  all.
             I  accordingly  find  that  the  appellant   has   failed   to
             substantiate (to  the  standard  of  a  reasonable  degree  of
             likelihood) that his subjective fear is well-founded.


Discussion

     6. HJ (Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010]  UKSC
        31 found that a person cannot be expected  to  deny  a  fundamental
        aspect of their personal  make  up,  such  as  religion,  political
        opinion, sexual orientation, if the reason  for  doing  so  was  to
        avoid the risk of persecution.
     7. Mr Greer relied upon decision in MSM  [2015]  UKUT  413  which  was
        considered further by the Court of Appeal in MSM  (Somalia)  [2016]
        EWCA   Civ   715.   Despite   commenting   upon   the   "Tribunal's
        unsatisfactory elision  of  the  concepts  of  actual  and  imputed
        opinion" the judgment of the Upper Tribunal was upheld on the basis
        it had in fact made a finding that MSM's pursuit  of  a  career  in
        journalism involving the expression of  political  opinion  is  "at
        least  partially  driven  by  political  conviction   relating   to
        conditions prevailing in Somalia" and it was not a case of  imputed
        political opinion.
     8. There is no finding by the Judge in this appeal that the reason the
        appellant published the  book  that  led  to  his  difficulties  in
        Bangladesh was as a result  of  a  career  activity  involving  the
        expression of a  genuinely  held  adverse  religious  opinion.  The
        appellant's own evidence before the Judge was that his writing  was
        a form of "release" without any indication that he was expressing a
        religious or political conviction in relation to views contrary  to
        the teachings of Islam. The fact the  appellant  in  MSM  succeeded
        before the Upper Tribunal is therefore  not  determinative  of  the
        issues in this appeal. There is a clear material difference between
        the circumstances of MSM and this appellant.
     9. It is also the case that there was insufficient evidence led before
        the Judge in relation to the appellant's motives for publishing the
        material over and above the statement  recorded  above.  Whilst  Mr
        Greer in his submissions claim this may be because the  reason  was
        obvious, in adversarial proceedings such as those before the First-
        tier Tribunal the Judge was entitled to assess the  merits  of  the
        appellant's claim on the basis of the evidence before him. In  this
        appeal the appellant was represented by experienced  solicitors  in
        terms of the preparation of the appeal and Mr Greer on the day.  No
        arguable legal error is established in the Judge's understanding of
        the evidence relating to the appellant's motives.
    10. It is therefore necessary to consider what the Court of Appeal said
        when looking at MSM in a case such as this where, as  there  is  no
        evidence  of  actual  adverse  religious  opinion,  the  underlying
        ground  of  persecution claimed  must be imputed  as   opposed   to
        actual,  and  whether it  was  open  to  the   appellant  to   take
        avoiding  action by not publishing any  further  works;  which  was
        clearly the finding of the Judge on the basis the  appellant  would
        not do so in any event.
    11. The Court of Appeal stated that the starting point was the language
        of the  Convention  and  the  Directive.  The  Directive  expressly
        protected those persecuted because of the characteristics listed in
        Articles 2(c) and 10(1)  whether  or  not  they  actually  had  the
        characteristic, provided it was "attributed to the  applicant  [for
        refugee status] by the  actor  of  persecution".  In  the  case  of
        political  opinion,  Article  10(1)(e)  expressly  protected  those
        persecuted because they had a political  opinion,  whether  or  not
        they had acted upon that opinion. The text  of  the  Directive  and
        Convention contemplated two questions. The first  was  whether  the
        applicant  for  refugee  status  faced  a  well-founded   fear   of
        persecution.  The second was the reason for that  persecution.   If
        the answer to the first question  was  "yes"  and  the  reason  for
        persecution was within Articles 2(c) and 10, the  language  of  the
        Directive left  little  room  for  examination  of  the  steps  the
        applicant might take to avoid persecution.  There  was   a   single
        test  for  refugee  status  and,  save  for  Article   8   of   the
        Directive  in  respect  of   internal   protection   and   internal
        relocation, there was no  separate  test  for  those  who  did  not
         in  fact  have  the  protected  characteristic but  to  whom  that
        characteristic was  imputed  by  the  actor  of  persecution.   The
        absence   of   any   provision   in   the   Convention    or    the
        Directive  dealing  with  the  possibility  of   avoiding   action,
        together  with  the  express exemption in  Article  8(1)  from  the
        basic approach in cases  where  there   was   no   real   risk   of
        persecution  in  part  of  the  applicant's   country   of  origin,
        pointed  against  the  implication  for  which  the  Secretary   of
        State  contended. Nothing in the Directive authorised a refusal  of
        refugee status on the basis that the applicant could but would  not
        in fact take reasonable steps to avoid persecution.
    12. Article 2(c) of Qualification directive reads:

(c) �refugee� means a third country national who, owing  to  a  well-founded
fear of  being  persecuted  for  reasons  of  race,  religion,  nationality,
political opinion or membership of a particular  social  group,  is  outside
the country of nationality  and  is  unable  or,  owing  to  such  fear,  is
unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country,  or
a stateless person, who, being outside of the  country  of  former  habitual
residence for the same reasons as mentioned above, is unable  or,  owing  to
such fear, unwilling to return to it,  and  to  whom  Article 12  does  not
apply;

    13. Article 10 reads:

        Article 10

        Reasons for persecution

        1.   Member States shall take the following elements into account
             when assessing the reasons for persecution:

             (a)  the concept of race shall in particular include
                  considerations of colour, descent, or membership of a
                  particular ethnic group;

             (b)  the concept of religion shall in particular include the
                  holding of theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs,
                  the participation in, or abstention from, formal worship
                  in private or in public, either alone or in community with
                  others, other religious acts or expressions of view, or
                  forms of personal or communal conduct based on or mandated
                  by any religious belief;

             (c)  the concept of nationality shall not be confined to
                  citizenship or lack thereof but shall in particular
                  include membership of a group determined by its cultural,
                  ethnic, or linguistic identity, common geographical or
                  political origins or its relationship with the population
                  of another State;

             (d)  a group shall be considered to form a particular social
         group where in particular:

                  members of that group share an innate characteristic, or a
                  common background that cannot be changed, or share a
                  characteristic or belief that is so fundamental to
                  identity or conscience that a person should not be forced
                  to renounce it, and

                  that group has a distinct identity in the relevant
                  country, because it is perceived as being different by the
                  surrounding society;

                  depending on the circumstances in the country of origin, a
                  particular social group might include a group based on a
                  common characteristic of sexual orientation. Sexual
                  orientation cannot be understood to include acts
                  considered to be criminal in accordance with national law
                  of the Member States: Gender related aspects might be
                  considered, without by themselves alone creating a
                  presumption for the applicability of this Article;

                  (e)  the concept of political opinion shall in particular
                      include the holding of an opinion, thought or belief
                      on a matter related to the potential actors of
                      persecution mentioned in Article 6 and to their
                      policies or methods, whether or not that opinion,
                      thought or belief has been acted upon by the
                      applicant.

         2.   When assessing if an applicant has a well-founded fear of
             being persecuted it is immaterial whether the applicant
             actually possesses the racial, religious, national, social or
             political characteristic which attracts the persecution,
             provided that such a characteristic is attributed to the
             applicant by the actor of persecution.

    14. Mr Greer accepts Ground 1 is a  reasons  challenge,  asserting  the
        appellant's evidence in cross-examination that the  reason  he  had
        not published anything further was because his second post  reached
        all his community and family and that he could not  afford  to  put
        his family at risk by publishing anything  further,  and  that  the
        reason those who had previously attacked him were still  interested
        in him was because they thought he had some more items written that
        he was trying to publish, is a credible reason  why  he  would  not
        wish to publish; which the Judge failed to adequately deal with.
    15. It asserted by Mr Greer that  the  Judge's  findings  in  [31]  are
        flawed for four reasons namely:

           i. Firstly, that the appellant's enemies cannot reach him in the
              United Kingdom is an irrelevant consideration; it is his case
              that he has not published books in the United Kingdom because
              his family remain in Bangladesh and have been targeted by his
              enemies.  Therefore,  the  Appellant's  explanation  for  his
              decision not to seek to publish books whilst  in  the  United
              Kingdom is linked to a fear of persecution of his  family  in
              Bangladesh.
          ii. Secondly, that  the  Appellant's  family  have  disowned  the
              appellant  to  disassociate  themselves  from  his  view   is
              suggestive of the truthfulness of his  explanation,  not  the
              contrary view taken by the First-tier Tribunal.
         iii.  Thirdly,  the  Appellant's  conversion  from   Hinduism   to
              Christianity is irrelevant to whether he would seek to  write
              and publish books upon return to Bangladesh.
          iv. Fourthly, the timing of the Appellant's evidence  in  respect
              of this matter is irrelevant. The reason  why  the  Appellant
              did not give this evidence earlier in the hearing is that  he
              simply was not asked.  The  suggestion  that  evidence  given
              during re-examination is of less value than evidence given at
              an earlier stage of the hearing is not adequately reasoned.


    16. It is not disputed that the appellant with  his  qualifications  is
        likely to be able to obtain employment  in  the  Merchant  Navy  on
        return to Bangladesh, but as submitted by Mr  Greer  they  will  be
        periods where the appellant will be 'shore based' either whilst  he
        is seeking employment on a ship or on leave.
    17. It is not disputed the appellant said in re-examination before  the
        Judge that he would continue to publish materials in defence of the
        Hindu community on return to Bangladesh but for the risk of harm he
        would face from Islamic fundamentalists and that the reason he  had
        not published material since he has been in the UK was as a  result
        of fears for the safety of his family in Bangladesh.
    18. It is a lawful finding of the Judge to state that  the  individuals
        the appellant fears have not  been  shown  to  have  any  reach  or
        influence within the United  Kingdom  and  that  if  the  appellant
        genuinely held  anti-Islamic  views  he  could  have  continued  to
        publish in the UK. This is not, however, an  appeal  based  upon  a
        genuinely held view but upon such  a  view  being  imputed  to  the
        appellant.
    19.  The  Judge  claimed  that  the  appellant's  explanation  for  not
        publishing was not accepted as being credible as a result of family
        disowning him in Bangladesh is  not  adequately  explained  as  it,
        arguably, takes no account of the fact the appellant may still have
        feelings for and a wish to protect his family from the consequences
        of any further publication.
    20. It is not clear how the appellant's  conversion  from  Hinduism  to
        Christianity undermines his claim with the exception that it can be
        inferred from  the  Judge's  finding  that  as  the  appellant  had
        converted to Christianity, he may not wish to make further  comment
        upon the extent to which Hindus are marginalised and  discriminated
        against by the Muslim majority population or state authorities.  Mr
        Greer's assertion that the appellant  may  still  wish  to  publish
        comment about the treatment of Christians in Bangladesh was not  an
        issue before the Judge.
    21. The Judge does not give less weight to the statement  made  by  the
        appellant in relation to the  reasons  why  he  would  not  further
        publish a reply to re-examination as a result of such  a  statement
        being made late  in  the  day,  but  because  the  Judge  found  it
        reasonable to expect that he would have made such a statement at  a
        much earlier stage in the proceedings had there been any  substance
        to it. That is a finding within the range of those reasonably  open
        to the Judge on the evidence especially in light of  the  fact  the
        appellant was represented throughout, when such matters would  have
        no doubt been discussed with his representative when preparing  his
        witness statement, but of which there  is  no  reference.  Such  an
        approach is supported by authorities such  as  ND  (Afghanistan)  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006]  EWCA  Civ   1363
        in which the Court of Appeal  said  the  adjudicator  was  entitled
         to  take  the  view  that  injuries  were  not  inflicted  in  the
         circumstances  described  by   the   appellant,   particularly  in
        light of the fact that he only revealed the  incidents  of  torture
        during  a  consultation  his  doctor  rather  than  at  an  initial
         interview.  At interview the appellant had failed to mention being
        hung up by the wrists for a long time and hung up by the heels  for
        four or five hours.
    22. In AM (Iran) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2006]
        EWCA  1813 the Iranian Appellant did not mention  problems  arising
        from his possession of the satanic verses until  after  the  asylum
        interview.  The Court of Appeal  upheld   the   Immigration  Judges
        decision  to  reject  the  Appellant's  account   on   that   basis
        and  observed  that  the  Appellant  had  given  a   detailed   and
        comprehensive   account   of   why   he   had    left    Iran    at
        interview,  an   account   which   differed   entirely   from   the
        explanation  he  proffered  five  weeks  later:  this  was  not   a
        case  in  which  the  Appellant  had been silent  and  the  reasons
        for his asylum claim only became clear later.
    23. In HN v Sweden (Application no. 30720/09) ECtHR (Fifth Section) the
        Swedish Migration Board had found the appellant  was  not  credible
        for various reasons.  That was upheld by the ECtHR who  noted  that
        many of his statements were vague and lacking in detail and had  he
        been subjected to the events alleged, it  would  be  reasonable  to
        assume  that  he  could  provide  more  specific  information.   In
        particular, it was thought  remarkable  that,   although   he   had
        escaped  from  prison,  where  he  had  allegedly  been   tortured,
        just  about  two  weeks  before   his   arrival   in   Sweden,   he
        apparently   made   no    attempt    to    draw    the    migration
        authorities'  attention  to  possible  injuries,  for  instance  by
        undergoing an initial health examination.
    24. It was  a  combination  of  that  comment  being  made  later  than
        expected, if genuine, and the appellant's move away  from  Hinduism
        that appear to be the cornerstones of the Judge's  conclusion  that
        the reason the appellant would not publish  further  is  not  as  a
        result of a fear of further acts by the Islamic fundamentalists  or
        negative impact on his family, but because he had lost interest  in
        the subject matter of the books that led to  the  difficulties  for
        him in the first instance.
    25. The Judge went on thereafter  to  consider  whether  the  appellant
        would face a real risk on return as a result of his past activities
        and  the  views  imputed  to  him  as  a  result  of  the  original
        publication. The Judge's conclusion on the basis  of  the  evidence
        that there was no real risk the appellant will be traced or  harmed
        by those in respect of whom he  has  an  understandable  subjective
        fear, is a conclusion that such subjective fear is not  objectively
        well-founded. The evidence before the  Judge  did  not  support  an
        argument that those the appellant expressed a fear of  were  likely
        to be aware of his return to Bangladesh  or  will  have  sufficient
        resources or inclination to seek him out.  There  was  no  evidence
        before the Judge that during any time the appellant would be living
        within Bangladesh, he would do anything that will raise his profile
        or that will create a real risk for him on return. The material the
        appellant claims led to his difficulties was published  some  years
        ago.
    26. The Judge was aware of  the  appellant's  earlier  experiences  and
        accepted the  credibility  of  the  same.  There  was  insufficient
        evidence to show that the appellant possessed religious views  that
        would, per se, expose him to a real risk on return  to  Bangladesh,
        making this an imputed opinion case. It is not made out  the  Judge
        adopted an impermissible approach contrary to the guidance provided
        by the Court of Appeal in MSM.  The Judge  clearly  considered  the
        core issue in the case which is whether the appellant would act  in
        a way that will create a credible real risk of further  persecution
        based  upon  an  adverse  imputed   view.   The   Judges   finding,
        notwithstanding other aspects of the claim being credible, that the
        appellant's claim that he would not continue to  publish  materials
        as a result of the  risk  to  himself  and  his  family  a  further
        persecution was not credible, giving rise to no real risk on return
        to Bangladesh, and the claim being dismissed by the Judge  for  the
        reasons set out at [31 - 34], has not been shown to  be  a  finding
        outside the range of those reasonably available to the Judge on the
        evidence.
    27. The Court of Appeal have made it abundantly clear  that  an  appeal
        judge should not overturn a decision on appeal just because  he  or
        she might make a different decision  on  the  evidence.  Whilst  Mr
        Greer takes the view that the Judge's reasons are  insufficient  to
        support the findings made, it is not made out the reasons given  do
        not allow a reader to understand why the Judge concluded as he did,
        or that those findings are irrational.
    28. The grant of permission to appeal, stating that it would appear  to
        be no answer to the claim that as the judge found at  paragraph  32
        he could avoid harm  by  taking  up  his  earlier  merchant  seamen
        career, arguably misrepresents the findings of the Judge which  was
        that the appellant would  avoid  harm  by  not  publishing  further
        material as he had  lost  interest  in  the  relevant  subject  and
        because his claim that he would avoid  doing  so  solely  to  avoid
        persecution was not found to be credible.  This  was  a  cumulative
        assessment  by  the  Judge.  The  point   about   merchant   seamen
        employment, which the appellant had stated he wished to follow, was
        noted by the Judge as was the fact the appellant would only spend a
        relatively short period of time in Bangladesh in any event. That is
        not the core reason relied upon by the Judge.
    29. For the above reasons the appeal is dismissed. It is not  made  out
        it is appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to interfere  any  further
        in relation to this appeal.
