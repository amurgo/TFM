                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 secretary of state for the home department
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. On 4 October I wrote to the parties as follows:


           "I have  received  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  the  grant  of
           permission in this case.  I note  in  particular  that  evidence
           that the translation of the identity card (upon which the  judge
           relied in making his assessment  of  credibility)  was  in  fact
           wrong was available before the determination was sent out.


           In the circumstances I propose to set aside the decision under
           appeal and direct a fresh hearing.  Any submissions to the
           contrary will be considered if received within 14 days of the
           date of this letter."



 2. No objection has been raised.  The  judge  erred  by  failing  to  take
    account of  all  relevant  evidence  available  before  the  Tribunal's
    decision was made.  I set aside the decision under  appeal  and  direct
    that  the  appellant's  appeal  be  re-determined  by  the   First-tier
    Tribunal.

                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                       Date: 6 November 2017
