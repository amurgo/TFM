                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                         NOTICE OF ABANDONED APPEAL

  Pursuant to Rule 17A(2) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
   2008 and Section 104(4A) of The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
                                    2002

   1.  The  appellant,  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan,  appealed  against  the
      respondent's decision of 22 January  2016  to  refuse  his  protection
      claim. His appeal was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  a
      decision promulgated on 28 September 2016. Permission to  appeal  that
      decision to the Upper Tribunal was granted on 24 October 2016.


   2. On 18 November 2016 the  appellant  was  granted  discretionary  leave
      until 18 May 2019. At  a  hearing  on  7  April  2017  the  respondent
      produced the letter of grant of leave and submitted  that  the  appeal
      was to be treated as abandoned since no notice of intention to proceed
      with the appeal had been received. The matter was  adjourned  for  the
      appellant to consider his position and on 20 April 2017 the  appellant
      gave written notice that he wished to continue the  appeal  and  asked
      that his notice be accepted out of time.


   3. On 4 May 2017 Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan admitted the notice out  of
      time and granted permission for the appellant to continue the  appeal.
      The appeal was then listed for hearing.


   4. At the hearing before  me  Ms  Manning,  representing  the  appellant,
      conceded that Judge Canavan had had no power to extend time  and  that
      the appeal had been abandoned after 30 days, pursuant to Rule  17A  of
      the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


   5. Accordingly, and with the agreement of both parties, for the appellant
      and  respondent,  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
      decision of 22 January 2016  is  to  be  treated  as  abandoned  under
      section 104(4A) of the 2002 Act.


   6. In accordance  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph  17A(2)  of  The
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008,  the  Tribunal  hereby
      notifies  the  parties  that  the  appeal  is  therefore  treated   as
      abandoned. That is the end of the matter before the Tribunal.
