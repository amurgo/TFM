                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For the purposes of this decision, I shall refer to  the  Appellant  as
    the Secretary of State and the Respondent as the claimant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge M J Gillespie (Judge Gillespie),  promulgated
    on 6 May 2015, in which he allowed the claimant's appeal.  That  appeal
    was against the Secretary of State's decision, dated 23 February  2014,
    refusing to issue a residence  card  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the  Regulations).  The  claimant  had
    claimed to be the durable partner of an EEA national, Ms Iwona  Kurnik,
    a citizen of Poland. The Secretary of State concluded that the claimant
    had failed to show that he was in a durable relationship and/or that Ms
    Kurnik was a qualified person. Therefore the  application  was  refused
    with reference to Regulation 8 of the Regulations.

Judge Gillespie's decision

 3. Judge Gillespie found as a fact that the  claimant  was  in  a  durable
    relationship with Ms Kurnik, and also that Ms  Kurnik  was  working  in
    this country, thereby making her a qualified person under Regulation  6
    of the Regulations (see paragraphs 6-14 of the decision).

 4. Judge Gillespie then went on to allow the appeal outright, rather  than
    only to the extent that the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  was  not
    otherwise in accordance with the law.

 5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the narrow ground
    that Judge  Gillespie  erred  in  allowing  the  appeal  outright.  The
    findings of fact relating to the relationship and  Ms  Kurnik's  status
    were not challenged.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Frankish
    on 13 July 2015.

The hearing before me

 7. Mr  Sutton  very  realistically  acknowledged  that  Judge  Gillespie's
    decision to allow the appeal outright was "probably" wrong in light  of
    the case law on Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations.

 8. For his part, Mr Melvin reaffirmed that none of  the  findings  on  the
    Regulation 8 issue were being challenged. He relied on the grounds.

Decision on error of law

 9. I find that Judge Gillespie  clearly  erred  in  law  by  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal outright, and that the error was material.

10. Having found that the claimant was in fact an extended family member of
    Ms Kurnik, in accordance with Regulation 8 of the Regulations, and that
    Ms Kurnik was herself a qualified person, the only lawful  option  open
    to Judge Gillespie was to allow the appeal only to the  limited  extent
    that  that  Secretary  of  State's  decision  was  "not  otherwise   in
    accordance with the law". This is because the Secretary  of  State  had
    not exercised her discretion under Regulation 17(4)  when  making  that
    decision (she having of course concluded that the  claimant  could  not
    satisfy Regulation 8 in the first instance).

11. The correct approach in cases such as  the  present  has  been  clearly
    stated by the  AIT,  as  it  then  was,  and  Upper  Tribunal  (see  in
    particular YB (EEA reg 17(4) -  proper  approach)  Ivory  Coast  [2008]
    UKAIT 00062 and more recently, Ihemedu (OFMs - meaning) Nigeria  [2011]
    UKUT 00340(IAC)).

12. The error of law is material and Mr Sutton  did  not  seek  to  suggest
    otherwise.

13. In light of the above, the Secretary of State's  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal succeeds and I set aside the decision of Judge Gillespie.

Re-make decision

14. The re-making  of  the  decision  is  a  straightforward  process.  The
    findings of fact made by Judge Gillespie have not been  challenged  and
    they stand. I  therefore  find  that  the  claimant  is  in  a  durable
    relationship with Ms Kurnik, and thus satisfies Regulation 8(5) of  the
    Regulations. I also find that Ms Kurnik was and is  a  worker.  She  is
    therefore a qualified person within  Regulation  6.  The  Secretary  of
    State was wrong to have concluded otherwise.

15. The Secretary of  State  has  yet  to  exercise  her  discretion  under
    Regulation 17(4). This she must  now  do,  having  full  regard  to  my
    findings of fact. I would add that at no stage (as far as  I  can  see)
    has any other misconduct or adverse comment been raised in  respect  of
    the claimant.

16. The claimant's appeal is therefore allowed to the limited  extent  that
    the Secretary of State's decision was not otherwise in accordance  with
    the law.

Anonymity

17. No direction was sought and none is appropriate.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal to  the  limited  extent  that
the Secretary of State's decision was not otherwise in accordance  with  the
law,  and  the  claimant's  application  for  a   residence   card   remains
outstanding before her, awaiting a lawful decision.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a reduced  fee
award of ï¿½40.00. This is because I note from the file  that  the  appeal  to
the First-tier Tribunal had been adjourned  previously  on  the  basis  that
evidence from the claimant had not been served in a timely manner,  and  was
not in a presentable state. So, although the claimant has succeeded  in  his
appeal, he (and his advisors) had clearly not  presented  the  Secretary  of
State with all relevant information with the application itself.
