                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal against the  determination
    of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Elvidge,  who   in   a   determination
    promulgated on 19 December 2013, following  hearing at Hatton Cross  on
    5 December 2013, had allowed the  appeals  of  Mrs  Abdelaziz  and  her
    children against the Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision  refusing  to
    grant them entry clearance.  For ease of  convenience,  I  shall  below
    refer to the Entry Clearance Officer, who was the original  respondent,
    as "the Entry Clearance Officer" and to Mrs Abdelaziz and her children,
    who were the original respondents, as "the claimants".

 2. On behalf of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Mr  Jarvis  informed  the
    Tribunal that the Entry Clearance Officer now wished  to  withdraw  his
    appeal against Judge Elvidge's  decision,  because  the  claimants  had
    subsequently been granted entry clearance.  Mr  Aitken  confirmed  that
    this was correct.

 3. It is not necessary to discuss within this determination the merits  of
    this appeal, because, the Entry Clearance Officer having withdrawn  his
    appeal against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  there  is  no
    longer a proper basis on which we could  find that the determination of
    the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of  law,  and  the
    consequence is that that decision must stand.   It  follows  that  this
    appeal must be dismissed and we so find.



Decision

The Entry Clearance Officer's appeal against the decision of the  First-tier
Tribunal is dismissed; the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  allowing
the appellants' appeal is affirmed.
