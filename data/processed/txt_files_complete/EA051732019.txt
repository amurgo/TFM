                            DECISION AND REASONS


         Background

      1. This appeal comes before me following the grant  of  permission  to
         appeal to the appellant by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Fisher  on  4
         May 2020 against the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Quinn, promulgated on 17 January 2020 following a hearing at Hatton
         Cross on 31 December 2019.

      2. The appellant is an Albania national born on 19 April 1981. He  has
         twice entered the UK unlawfully. He initially arrived  in  November
         1999 and claimed asylum. That was refused on October  2000  and  an
         appeal against that decision was dismissed  on  21  February  2001.
         Further representations were made in March 2001 but  refused  under
         paragraph 353 of the Immigration  Rules  in  August  2001  and  the
         appellant was removed in February 2006.  He returned  illegally  in
         July  2006  but  it  was  not  until  November  2012/January  2013,
         according to his chronology,  that  he  sought  to  regularise  his
         status. This was refused in March 2014. In  July  2014  he  made  a
         further application but that was refused on 16 September  2019.  An
         application for  reconsideration  was  made  in  October  2014  but
         refusal was maintained on 15 October 2014. A judicial review  claim
         was then filed on  10  November  2014  but  refused  by  the  Upper
         Tribunal on 18 June 2015. Fresh human rights  representations  were
         made on 10 July 2014 but these were refused  and  certified  on  26
         October 2015. Another request for reconsideration was  made  on  30
         October 2015 but refused.

      3. In December 2018, the appellant applied for a residence card as the
         dependant of his brother, an Italian national, who had come here in
         September  2016  and  who  lived  with  his  wife  and  child.  The
         application was refused on 9 January 2019  because  the  respondent
         was not satisfied that the  appellant  had  established  dependency
         upon his brother. It was noted that the appellant  had  claimed  he
         had come here to make an asylum application and  that  his  brother
         arrived here after the appellant's second entry and that he had not
         made any reference to dependency upon his brother  in  any  of  his
         previous applications or representations.

      4. The appellant lodged an appeal. It came before First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Quinn at Hatton Cross and she heard oral  evidence  from  the
         appellant and his brother. She noted that the sponsor's income  did
         not even meet the minimum wage  and  was  not  satisfied  it  could
         support him and his family let alone the  appellant  as  well.  She
         found that the appellant could well be working in the  UK  himself,
         noting that he had been doing so when he had permission to work and
         also when he did not. She noted that no details  of  the  sponsor's
         employment in Italy had been given even though it was claimed  that
         he had been supporting the appellant  and  their  mother  from  his
         income. There was no evidence of  shared  cohabitation  at  the  St
         Leonard's Road accommodation and the judge had no evidence from the
         landlord to confirm the appellant's residence with his  brother  at
         the present  claimed  address.  She  was  not  satisfied  that  the
         appearance of  his  name  on  utility  bills  proved  residence  or
         dependency and noted no council tax  bill  had  been  adduced.  She
         noted that the application  had  only  been  made  when  all  other
         avenues had failed and concluded that the appellant had  failed  to
         show he relied on his brother for his essential living  needs.  She
         also found that he had not been dependent upon him when he had been
         living in Albania after his removal in  2006.  She  considered  his
         scant regard for the  immigration  laws  and  considered  that  his
         behaviour cast doubt on his honesty.  Accordingly  the  appeal  was
         dismissed.

      5. The appellant sought permission to appeal. Three grounds  were  put
         forward. The first was that the judge erred  in  finding  that  the
         appellant had not been dependent upon his brother between  February
         and July 2006 whilst living in Albania. It is  submitted  that  the
         appellant and his brother had given consistent oral  evidence  that
         people had delivered money to the appellant from the sponsor,  that
         the appellant could not have worked because he was caring  for  his
         sick father and that he had not raised dependency in  1999  because
         his dependency post dated his first entry to the  UK.   The  second
         ground argues that  the  judge  made  inconsistent  findings  about
         dependency in paragraphs 37 and 55. The third  ground  argues  that
         the judge failed to consider whether the appellant was a member  of
         the sponsor's household. It is submitted that the  bank  statements
         also showed cohabitation and that these were not considered.

      6. Permission was granted on the basis that the  judge  arguably  made
         inconsistent findings. Although the judge considered that the other
         grounds  were  a  disagreement  with  the  judge's  findings,   the
         appellant was not prohibited from arguing them.

         Covid-19 crisis: preliminary matters

      7. The appeal would normally have been listed for  hearing  after  the
         grant of permission but due to the pandemic this did not happen and
         instead directions were issued on 15 July 2020 inviting the parties
         to make submissions on the manner of disposal and on the merits.

      8. Neither party has complied with the directions. I am satisfied that
         they were properly served and I now consider  whether  this  matter
         can be determined on the papers.

      9. In doing  so  I  have  regard  to  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
         Tribunal) Rules 2008 (the UT Rules), the judgment of Osborn  v  The
         Parole Board [2013] UKSC 61, the Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1
         2020: Arrangements during  the  Covid-19  pandemic  (PGN)  and  the
         Senior President's Pilot Practice Direction (PPD). I have regard to
         the overriding objective which is defined in rule 2 of the Tribunal
         Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 as being "to enable the Upper
         Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly". To this end I  have
         considered that dealing with a case  fairly  and  justly  includes:
         dealing with it in ways that are proportionate to the importance of
         the case, the complexity of the issues, etc;  avoiding  unnecessary
         formality and seeking flexibility in the proceedings; ensuring,  so
         far as practicable, that the parties are able to participate  fully
         in the proceedings;  using  any  special  expertise  of  the  Upper
         Tribunal effectively; and avoiding delay, so far as compatible with
         proper consideration of the issues (Rule 2(2) UT rules and PGN:5).

     10. I have had regard to the grounds for permission, the  determination
         and all the evidence when deciding how to proceed. I take the  view
         that a full account of the facts are set out in those papers,  that
         the arguments for and against the appellant have been  clearly  set
         out and that the issues to be decided  are  straightforward.  There
         are  no  matters  arising  from  the  papers  which  would  require
         clarification and so an oral hearing would not be needed  for  that
         purpose. I am satisfied that both sides have had the opportunity to
         respond with their views as to a paper  determination  and  to  the
         merits of the errors of law alleged by the appellant but  have  not
         done so. I consider that neither party would be disadvantaged by  a
         paper determination and that I am able to fairly  and  justly  deal
         with this matter on the evidence before me.

         Discussion and conclusions

     11. I have considered all the papers before me.

     12. I find that there is no merit  at  all  in  the  first  ground.  It
         essentially amounts to an  argument  that  the  judge  should  have
         accepted the claim of dependency in Albania on the sole basis  that
         the appellant and his brother both made that claim  in  their  oral
         evidence. The judge was not satisfied that  the  appellant  was  an
         honest witness. His past conduct and behaviour in entering  the  UK
         illegally on two occasions,  remaining  for  long  periods  without
         making any attempt to regularise his stay all demonstrate  a  scant
         regard for the laws of this country and the judge was  entitled  to
         find that this reflected on the weight she could give to  his  oral
         evidence. His brother would have known that the appellant was  here
         illegally and there is no suggestion he attempted to influence  him
         to regularise his stay. The judge was entitled to find  that  there
         was no supporting evidence of the dependency which could have  been
         provided. It is argued that the appellant could not work in Albania
         in 2006 because he was caring  for  his  sick  father  but  in  his
         witness statement he claims to have returned "due  to  my  father's
         death". The sponsor maintained in his witness  statement  that  "at
         the time our father died, this appellant decided to return back  to
         Albania to take part in his funeral". The contention in the grounds
         that the judge should have considered that the appellant could  not
         work on his return to Albania because he had to care for  his  sick
         father is this wholly undermined and contradicted by  the  evidence
         of the appellant and his brother that the father had died prior  to
         the appellant's return. If a different account  was  given  at  the
         hearing, that only reinforces the judge's view that  the  appellant
         cannot be relied on to tell the truth.

     13. The ground also seeks to explain the appellant's failure to mention
         his dependency on his brother in his 1999 application on the  basis
         that the dependency commenced post arrival. However the grounds are
         entirely silent on why then the appellant did not make reference to
         it in any of the many representations and applications he  made  to
         the Home Office  subsequently  and  most  significantly  after  his
         return in 2006 when, by his own account, he  had  become  dependent
         upon his brother. It was entirely open to the judge  to  find  that
         had there been a genuine dependency, it would have  been  mentioned
         and not relied on at the very end when all other attempts to remain
         here had failed.

     14. Turning now to the second ground, I find that  the  author  of  the
         grounds has misunderstood what the judge said. Paragraph 37 must be
         read with paragraph 36; it is plain that the judge was setting  out
         the appellant's claim and the sentence at 37 is a summary of  that;
         it is not an inconsistent finding. Alternatively, if the judge  did
         indeed make a mistake at paragraph 37, it cannot be anything  other
         than a typographical error as it can be seen from the determination
         that  the  judge  was  consistent  throughout  that  the  claim  of
         dependency had not been met. Her reasoning  at  31-35,  38-55  make
         that eminently clear and plainly  focus  on  the  reasons  why  she
         concluded that the appeal could not succeed.

     15. The third ground is that the judge did  not  consider  whether  the
         appellant was a member of the sponsor's household.  I  cannot  find
         that the appellant can succeed on this basis either. The judge  was
         plainly aware that this  was  an  issue;  she  records  it  as  the
         appellant's  case  at  paragraph  13.  She  considers  whether  the
         appellant and sponsor lived together as  the  grounds  concede  but
         finds that bills do not show cohabitation and  that  there  was  no
         confirmation from the landlord, no tax documents or wage  slips  to
         show an address for the appellant. Having found  that  cohabitation
         had not been established and that dependency  had  not  been  shown
         either, it follows that the appellant could not have been found  to
         be part of the sponsor's household. Even  if  the  judge  does  not
         specifically state as such in her determination, no  other  outcome
         could have been possible on the available evidence and the findings
         that were made. The bank statements take matters no further but  in
         any event the judge was aware of them (at 19, 32 and 48).

     16. The judge properly found that the sponsor's income of �13,000 could
         not support his own family let alone the appellant as well. I  note
         from the appellant's application form that rent alone (of �1100 per
         month  excluding  bills)  eats  away  all  the   income.   Plainly,
         therefore, the truth  has  not  been  told.  When  the  absence  of
         meaningful evidence such as evidence from the landlord,  supporting
         statements from  those  who  allegedly  transported  funds  to  the
         appellant in Albania, evidence of the sponsor's work in  Italy  and
         the appellant's own pay slips, the judge was entitled to find  that
         real dependency had not been shown. The appellant's admission  that
         he worked with and without permission to do so,  his  scant  regard
         for the laws and the failure to mention his  so  called  dependency
         until 2018 were all matters the judge was entitled to consider.

     17. For these reasons, I find that the judge's decision to dismiss  the
         appeal contains no errors of law and it is upheld.




         Decision

     18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain any errors
         of law. The decision to dismiss the appeal is upheld.

         Anonymity

     19. No application for an anonymity order has been made  at  any  stage
         and I see no reason to make one.
