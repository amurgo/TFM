For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This appeal concerns a spouse  entry  clearance  application,  made  in
    Bangladesh on 8 July 2012.  The date is significant because it was  one
    day before the Immigration Rules were changed, through the introduction
    of Appendix FM on 9 July  2012  (as  a  result  of  HC  194).   It  was
    therefore agreed before us that the relevant law to  be  considered  is
    the law as it was on 8 July 2012.  This was set out in paragraph 281 of
    the  Immigration  Rules,  and  the  test  for  the  level  of  adequate
    maintenance was that  to  be  found  in  KA  and  Others  (Adequacy  of
    maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065, and subsequent cases.

2.   The appellant and the sponsor, who was present at  the  hearing  before
    us, were married in Bangladesh in 2009, and they have a  daughter,  who
    is a British citizen.  She was born on 21 December 2009  and  currently
    remains in Bangladesh with her mother (the appellant).

3.   At the  time  of  the  refusal  there  were  other  issues  (subsisting
    marriage; accommodation; and English language) but by the date  of  the
    determination of the appeal by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Maxwell,  in
    which he dismissed the appeal, it was agreed before us that maintenance
    was the only remaining issue.  This was because  the  English  language
    point had been conceded at the hearing, and  the  judge  found  in  the
    appellant's favour on the accommodation and subsisting marriage points.



4.   The grounds seeking permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  raised
    three points.  The first was that the judge had erred  in  taking  into
    account travel costs in the  maintenance  calculation.   Reference  was
    made to the case of Yarce (Adequate maintenance: benefits) [2012]  UKUT
    425 (IAC) as well as KA and Others mentioned above.  The second  ground
    was that the judge erred in including the appellant's British  daughter
    in the calculations, because she would be  entitled  in  law  to  claim
    whatever public funds were due to her, and any  such  funds  would  not
    amount  to  additional  recourse.   The  third  ground  was  that   the
    assessment of Article 8 had failed to give  sufficient  weight  to  the
    rights and privileges of the appellant's child as a British citizen.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ransley
    on 19 August 2014 on the basis that all grounds may be argued.   During
    the course of the hearing, in hearing from  both  representatives,  the
    position taken by Mr Wilding developed  into  an  effective  concession
    that the appellant's daughter was entitled to claim benefits, or rather
    her father would be entitled to claim  on  her  behalf,  and  that  the
    relevant amounts included in the calculations used by the judge  should
    therefore not have included income support levels for the  child.   The
    issue that remained, however, was Mr Wilding's concern about the travel
    costs.  Since the sponsor would have been living in Wales  but  working
    in a restaurant in Windsor these would have been considerable.  On  the
    sums in the determination, where it  was  agreed  before  us  that  the
    approach taken to the notional income from  savings  was  correct,  the
    sponsor's actual income from his employment and savings  left  only  an
    amount of approximately �30 per week for travel, and this could not  be
    regarded as sufficient.  As a result Mr Wildings' submission  was  that
    the decision should remain undisturbed  because  any  error  about  the
    inclusion of the appellant's daughter was not material to the  outcome,
    on the basis that the appeal would  still  have  had  to  be  dismissed
    because of the travel costs point.

6.   On this issue Mr Hasan, for the appellant, relied on KA and Others,  as
    well as Yarce, and the more recent case of Ahmed  (Benefits:  proof  of
    receipt; evidence) [2013] UKUT 00084 (IAC).  Mr Hasan's submission  was
    that the principles from  KA  and  following  cases  were  clear.   The
    calculation to be conducted had been settled  as  being  one  involving
    notional income  support  level  less  housing  costs.   There  was  no
    authority for including other ancillary costs, whether travel costs  or
    otherwise, in the calculations.   Mr  Hasan  relied  in  particular  on
    paragraph 10 of Ahmed which referred to both Yarce and KA  and  Others,
    with further reference to an additional case (Uvovo).   The decision in
    Sohail Ahmed also deals with the effect of paragraph 6A to  6C  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  These set up the additional recourse rule (6A), but
    then refer to various exemptions in the case of joint  benefits  for  a
    couple (6B), although as a result of paragraph 6C these are not  to  be
    taken into account in an entry clearance assessment.

Decision

7.   We have decided that an error of law has been shown, and  that  it  was
    material to the outcome.

8.   The situation of the appellant's daughter appears to us  to  be  clear.
    As a British citizen she is not subject to immigration control.  She is
    entitled to live in the UK with her father.  On arrival in the  UK  her
    father would be entitled to claim child benefit, and there may  be  tax
    credits available in addition.  Any such benefits would not  amount  to
    additional recourse to public funds  caused  by  the  presence  of  the
    appellant.  As a result any entitlement flowing  from  the  appellant's
    daughter's presence in the UK would  not  count  on  the  side  of  the
    calculation in which it was included by the judge.  That is to say that
    any benefit entitlement flowing from the child's presence  would  count
    on the income side, rather than on the  side  of  the  notional  income
    support entitlement level that had to be  met.   In  this  respect  our
    decision is that the judge erred in law in the inclusion of figures for
    the child on the notional income support levels.

9.   Mr Wildings' submission that this error was not  material,  because  of
    the travel costs issue, is one that we do not accept for  a  number  of
    reasons.  Firstly it is notable that the judge made no findings  as  to
    what the travel costs were.  This appears to have been  an  issue  that
    was not addressed at the hearing itself.  The structure of the  judge's
    reasoning in the determination was to raise the matter  as  a  concern,
    but  then  conduct  all  of  the  calculations  leaving  that   concern
    unquantified, and in the background.  As a result of the  structure  of
    the calculations, which we have already said  involved  an  error,  the
    judge concluded that the appellant and the sponsor failed to  meet  the
    level required even if travel expenses were ignored.   If  the  judge's
    determination had included findings as to  the  amount  of  the  travel
    expenses, which it did not, then Mr  Wildings'  submission  might  have
    rested on firmer ground, but as it is the travel  costs  issue  appears
    never to have been the subject of evidence, and was never quantified at
    any stage.  If the judge had attempted to quantify it,  it  not  having
    been raised in evidence, there would have been an obvious concern  both
    on fairness grounds, and in relation to speculation.

10.  The above points are  specific  to  the  evidential  position  in  this
    appeal, but there is a more general point, and on this  we  accept,  in
    broad terms, the submissions put forward by Mr Hasan.  The formula that
    was developed from KA and Others, and maintained in other cases, was  a
    simple one.  This was an important virtue.  If it had  been  necessary,
    in every case, to produce a comprehensive list of projected income  and
    expenditure, then this would have been complex and time-consuming.  The
    simple formula of income support level less housing costs, on the other
    hand, was manageable as a yardstick, and did not involve the  types  of
    calculation that would require detailed knowledge of  the  complexities
    of the benefits system.  We accept the  submission  by  Mr  Hasan  that
    there is nothing in any  of  the  cases  referred  to  suggesting  that
    further costs should be added to the formula in individual cases, based
    on ancillary expenses for travel or any other matters.

11.  The complexity, if there were to be an  attempt  to  cover  all  items,
    would also cut both ways.  What would be required would be  a  detailed
    projection of benefits that would  be  available,  as  well  as  income
    support, and a differentiation between those benefits that would amount
    to additional recourse, and those that would not.  Whilst  we  can  see
    some virtue in the more comprehensive approach, of assessing income and
    expenditure in detail in every individual case, we can also see  virtue
    in the simplicity of the formula that emerged and remained in use until
    the introduction of Appendix FM in 2012.  On the general  legal  point,
    therefore, we accept the  submission  that  there  is  nothing  in  the
    relevant case  law  to  support  the  idea  that  additional  ancillary
    expenses should be taken into account  as  an  addition  to  the  basic
    formula of income support less housing costs.

12.  For both the specific and general reasons set out above, therefore,  we
    have decided that the error of law was in fact material to the outcome.
     We therefore set aside the decision.

13.  Before  the  end  of  the  hearing  we  gave  both  representatives  an
    opportunity to make any further submissions as to how we should  remake
    the decision if we were to decide that there was a  material  error  of
    law.  Both representatives were content  to  rely  on  the  submissions
    already made.

14.  In turning to remake the decision we have decided  that  the  remaining
    findings in the judge's determination are sufficient to establish  that
    the appeal falls to be allowed under the Immigration Rules.   When  the
    amounts factored in for the appellant's daughter are removed  from  the
    calculations what remains is that the appellant and the  sponsor  would
    have had to establish an income in excess  of  �111.45  per  week  (the
    income support amount for an adult couple).  At the date  of  decision,
    although the sponsor had been earning at a higher  level  earlier,  his
    net income had fallen to �123.80 per week.  It was agreed that  it  had
    been correct to allocate the sponsor's savings, which were then  around
    �2,000, to produce an additional  income  of  �17  per  week  over  the
    probationary period.  This produced an income figure of just over  �140
    per week.  This was approximately �30 over the  income  support  level,
    after taking account of the fact that there were effectively no housing
    costs because of the provision of accommodation by a relative.

15.  Although it could be said that, because of  the  reduced  income  level
    (and we do not know whether this remains  the  case)  the  figures  are
    quite close to the income support level, nevertheless  they  are  above
    that level, and therefore meet the test set out in KA and Others.

16.  As we have already said that was the only remaining  issue,  since  the
    other points were decided in the appellant's favour, or  conceded,  and
    no challenge has been made to those aspects of the determination.

17.  The decision in the appeal therefore falls to be remade  on  the  basis
    that the appellant did establish that, at the  date  of  decision,  she
    would have  been  adequately  maintained  on  arrival  in  the  UK,  in
    accordance with the relevant legal test as  it  was  on  8  July  2012,
    before the introduction of Appendix FM.

18.  It was not suggested that there was  any  need  for  anonymity  in  the
    appeal.  We make no such order.  The First-tier  Judge,  in  dismissing
    the appeal, made no fee award.  The  issue  of  a  fee  award  was  not
    mentioned by either side before us.  It is not entirely clear, but  the
    appellant has not established that the outcome of the  appeal  did  not
    rest on matters presented after the  application  was  made.   On  that
    basis we have decided, despite having remade the decision  by  allowing
    the appeal, not to make any fee award.

Decision

19.  The judge erred in law in  a  manner  material  to  the  outcome.   The
    decision dismissing the appeal on maintenance  grounds  is  set  aside.
    The following decision, in remaking the appeal, is substituted for  it.



20.  The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

     Despite having allowed the appeal we  have  decided,  for  the  reasons
    given above, not to make any fee award.
