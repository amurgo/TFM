                              MR NOSA IGUMA JOE

                                                         Respondent/Claimant


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss Appiah, of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Senior Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.   The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 22nd  January  1980.   He
    married Miss Glockner, a German citizen, on 28th  July  2007.   He  was
    granted a residence card valid for five years  on  8th  February  2008.


2.   The claimant applied on  8th  November  2012  for  permanent  residence
    under the  provisions  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.  This was refused by the respondent on 5th June 2013.



3.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Lindsley on 17th January 2014.

4.   The Judge found that the claimant satisfied  the  requirements  of  the
    2006 Regulations as to allow the appeal.  The claim under Article 8  of
    the ECHR was allowed in line with the successful appeal.

5.   The Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  sought  to  appeal
    against that decision on the basis that the Judge  had  misapplied  the
    Regulations  and  should  not  have   allowed   the   appeal   in   the
    circumstances.  On 25th February 2014 permission to appeal was  granted
    and thus the matter comes before me in pursuance of that permission.

6.   At the hearing Ms Appiah, who represents the claimant, sought  to  take
    a preliminary issue, namely that the appeal was in fact out of time.

7.   She invited my attention to Rule  24  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.   Rule  24(2)  provides   that   an
    application must be sent or delivered to the Tribunal  so  that  it  is
    received no later than five days after the  date  on  which  the  party
    making the application is deemed  to  have  been  served  with  written
    reasons for the decision.

8.   Notification of that it was received by the Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department on 27th January 2014.

9.   Five working days from that moment of receipt  meant  that  the  appeal
    should have been lodged on 3rd February.  It is common ground that  the
    notice of appeal was signed  on  3rd  February  but  not  sent  to  the
    Tribunal until 7.21am on 4th February.

10.  Ms Appiah submits, firstly, that the grounds of appeal as  received  by
    the Tribunal were in fact out of time and therefore that  the  decision
    granting permission was void for lack of jurisdiction.

11.  I indicated to her that I did not agree  with  that  argument.   It  is
    clear that nobody had noticed the fact that the grounds were  just  out
    of time.  No  point  was  taken  either  by  the  Tribunal  or  by  any
    representative nor indeed by the Judge who considered the matter.   The
    fact that an appeal is out of time does not remove the appeal from  the
    jurisdiction of the Tribunal.  It is always for the Tribunal to  extend
    time in the appropriate circumstances.

12.  It seemed to me that the grant of permission stands  as  a  conditional
    grant. The decision whether or not to extend time for  appealing  rests
    with me, standing as it were in the shoes of the Immigration Judge  and
    applying Rule 24(4)(a) of the 2005 Rules.  Such Rules indicate that the
    Tribunal may extend time for appealing if satisfied that by  reason  of
    special circumstances it would be unjust not to do so.

13.  Mr Bramble,  who  represents  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department, indicated that he  had  only  been  able  to  make  limited
    inquiries given that this point was only taken on the  morning  of  the
    hearing.  It is clear he submits that the caseworker had considered the
    matter in time, as evidenced by the dated signature to the  grounds  of
    appeal.  Why the grounds were not sent by facsimile on that same day is
    a matter of speculation.  There could be a number of reasons for  that,
    either that that particular fax did not go through and had to be resent
    or the volume of faxes made sending on the same day difficult.  What is
    clear however is that urgent steps were taken on the following  day  to
    send through the grounds of appeal  well  before  the  working  day  at
    7.21am.  There was no lack of diligence on the part of the Secretary of
    State for the Home Department.  It  is  also  relevant  in  considering
    whether or not it would be just to extend time to note  the  merits  of
    the appeal in any event.

14.  Ms Appiah invited me to find that I had  to  be  satisfied  that  there
    were special circumstances but none had been advanced.  No  explanation
    had been made as to the causes of the  delay  and  therefore  that  the
    first hurdle as envisaged under the Rule had not been complied with.

15.  It seems to me that the interests of justice require  a  realistic  and
    not unduly technical approach to  this  issue.   Special  circumstances
    would seem to be in this case that it was an  appeal  clearly  prepared
    and signed within the requisite period and  as  sent  soon  after  that
    period as could be  imagined.   There  can  be  no  suggestion  of  any
    prejudice by the delay, indeed the delay itself cannot be  said  to  be
    significant in any practical way at all.

16.  In the circumstances I have no hesitation to extend time in this  case.
     I deem, therefore, that the application for permission  to  appeal  is
    properly before the Tribunal for a  substantive  consideration  of  the
    merits.

17.  The permanent right of residence is to be acquired in  accordance  with
    Regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations.  That provides as follows:-

    (1)  the following persons shall acquire the right  to  reside  in  the
         United Kingdom permanently -


         (a)  an EEA national who has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
             accordance with these Regulations for a continuous  period  of
             five years;


         (b)  the family member of an EEA national who is not himself an EEA
             national but who has resided in the United  Kingdom  with  the
             EEA national  in  accordance  with  these  Regulations  for  a
             continuous period of five years.

18.  What lies at the heart of this appeal therefore is whether or  not  the
    claimant's spouse, Miss Glockner, has resided in the United Kingdom  as
    an EEA national exercising treaty rights for the five year period.

19.  It seems to be common ground that between 2007 and 2008 the  claimant's
    spouse was a worker within the meaning  of  the  Regulations  and  that
    since April 2010 she is to be regarded as self-employed.

20.  Thus the requisite period for consideration under  the  focus  of  this
    appeal is the period 2008 to April 2010.  It is contended on behalf  of
    the claimant that during this period his  wife  was  exercising  treaty
    rights as a self-sufficient person and thus accordingly the whole  five
    year period has been duly accounted for.

21.  The Judge at paragraph 41 of the determination looks therefore at  this
    crucial period between April 2008 and January 2010.  It was  argued  on
    behalf of the claimant that  his  wife  was  a  self-sufficient  person
    reliant on her husband's wages and gift payments from  her  parents  in
    accordance with Regulation 6(1)(d) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations
    2006.  This claimant's wife supplied a Lloyds Bank  statement  for  the
    period from April 2008 to October 2009, showing cash payments into  the
    account. In addition the claimant supplied his P60s for his  work  with
    Superdrug Store for the year ending April 2009.  It was the finding  of
    the Judge that those figures gave the claimant and his  partner  a  net
    income of �22,145 for the period of two years April 2008 to April  2009
    which in effect meant a weekly amount after payment of  rent  of  �134,
    which was in excess of �195  paid  per  week  to  a  couple  on  income
    support.  The Judge also  found  it  likely  that  Miss  Glockner  also
    received cash from her parents although  that  such  figures  were  not
    quantified.  The Judge therefore went on to  find  that  Miss  Glockner
    satisfied Regulation 4(1)(c)(i) of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006 during the period April 2008 to January 2010.

22.  Mr Bramble submitted that that was to misunderstand the import  of  the
    Regulations.  The claimant derived his right to reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom from the status of his wife as an EEA national  exercising  her
    rights.  There would be an undue circularity of matters if her  ability
    to exercise her rights in fact derived from his  financial  support  of
    her.

23.  Further it is submitted that to be a self-sufficient person within  the
    Regulations is to have comprehensive sickness insurance  cover  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Mr Bramble submits that  there  again  the  Judge  has
    fallen into error in  paragraph  42.   The  Judge  had  regard  to  the
    National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989
    and had concluded that such Regulations provided to the claimant and to
    his spouse the relevant cover that was required.

24.  Mr Bramble invited my attention to the  text  of  the  National  Health
    Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989 which sets  out
    what is the interpretation of an overseas visitor.  "Overseas  visitor"
    means "a person not ordinarily resident in the United  Kingdom."     Mr
    Bramble submits  that  the  claimant  and  his  spouse  are  ordinarily
    resident in the United Kingdom.  They have been for the past five years
    or more.  I was invited to find that there needs to be cover other than
    under this particular Regulation and that that is not established.

25.  Ms Appiah, who  represents  the  appellant,  invited  my  attention  to
    Regulation 4 as set out  in  her  Rule  24  response.   Self-sufficient
    person is one who has sufficient resources not to become  a  burden  on
    the social assistance system of the United Kingdom during the period of
    residence and has comprehensive sickness cover in the United Kingdom.

26.  The Regulation goes on as follows in Regulation 4(2):

         "    For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the  family  members  of
             the person concerned reside in the United  Kingdom  and  their
             right to reside is dependent upon their being  family  members
             of that person -


             (a)  the  requirement  for  that  person  to  have  sufficient
                  resources not to become a burden on the social  assistance
                  system  of  the  United  Kingdom  during  his  period   of
                  residence shall only be satisfied  if  his  resources  and
                  those of the family members are sufficient  to  avoid  him
                  and the family members becoming such a burden;


             (b)  the requirement for that  person  to  have  comprehensive
                  sickness insurance cover in the United Kingdom shall  only
                  be satisfied if he and his family members have such cover.




         (4)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c) and  (d)  and  paragraphs
             (2) and (3), the resources of the person concerned and,  where
             applicable,  any  family  members,  are  to  be  regarded   as
             sufficient if they exceed the maximum level of resources which
             a United Kingdom national and his family members  may  possess
             if he is to become eligible for social  assistance  under  the
             United Kingdom benefit system."


27.  Ms Appiah relies particularly upon Regulation  4(2)(a)  and  the  words
    "be satisfied if his resources and those  of  the  family  members  are
    sufficient."  She invites me to find that on the plain wording  of  the
    Rules the earnings from the claimant as a family member  can  be  taken
    into consideration to determine whether or not the sponsor is  a  self-
    employed person or not.

28.  So far as the issue of comprehensive sickness insurance  cover  in  the
    United Kingdom is concerned, she invites me to find  that  the  Judge's
    approach cannot be faulted.  There is no definition beyond the  general
    statement as to what "ordinarily resident" means.  Neither the claimant
    nor his wife are citizens of the United Kingdom.   She  invites  me  to
    find that ordinarily does not apply to them such as they  may  fall  to
    benefit from the terms of  the  National  Health  Service  (Charges  to
    Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989.

29.   Although  the  wording  of  Regulation  4(2)(a)  may  be  capable   of
    supporting the argument that the claimant's wife may use his  resources
    to found her status as a self-sufficient person, it is clear  from  the
    jurisprudence such a situation is not permissible.
     The circularity of the position was considered in particular in MA  and
    Others (EU national; self-sufficiency;  lawful  employment)  Bangladesh
    [2006] UKAIT 00090 That case decided that an EEA national child  cannot
    rely upon income derived from a parent lawfully working in  the  United
    Kingdom during a period of limited leave  in  order  to  establish  her
    right of residence based upon "self-sufficiency".  The parent/carer can
    derive no right of residence under EU law in such circumstances either.
     Paragraph 34 of that judgment is as follows:-

         "Third, it is equally clear that in none of the decided  cases  has
         income earned by a family member of an  EU  national  in  the  host
         member state been taken  into  account  where  that  family  member
         thereby acquired or sought to sustain a right of residence  derived
         from the right of residence of the EU national who  is  'dependent'
         upon  that  income  to  establish  or  sustain  his  own  right  of
         residence."


    The case of Chen was considered particularly in that regard.

30.  As was commented in paragraph 35 when looking at another  case  the  EU
    national's partner was not seeking to derive any  right  to  reside  or
    work in Belgium from the EU national:-


         "There was in that case no element of bootstrapping or  circularity
         whereby the right of  a  family  member  to  reside  and  work  was
         established only through the EU national whose right  was  likewise
         dependent upon the family member working."

31.  It was stressed in the course of the judgment that the  requirement  of
    "self-sufficiency" goes to  the  "existence"  of  the  EU's  national's
    rights and that that right and the derivative rights of the parents can
    only be established if the strictly limited conditions imposed  by  the
    EU Directives are satisfied.
32.  Similar considerations were  noted  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  the
    decision of W (China) and Another v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2006] EWCA Civ 1494.

33.  It is clear that the claimant in this case cannot acquire the right  of
    residence on account of his spouse's exercise of treaty rights,  unless
    she is exercising those rights independently of him.  He cannot use his
    earnings to create that status for her and through her, himself.

34.  It may well be that she can use the contributions from her  parents  to
    create that self-sufficiency.  There is little evidence as to precisely
    the amounts that were provided by her parents.  Certainly there  is  no
    indication that the amounts which were provided would have exceeded the
    requirements of �109 per week for a couple on income support.

35.  Thus I find that the Judge has fallen into error  seeking  to  use  the
    earnings of  the  claimant  to  give  rise  to  the  finding  of  self-
    sufficiency.

36.  So far as the question of comprehensive insurance is concerned, it  was
    considered by the Court of Appeal in FK (Kenya) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 1302 where at paragraph  15  of
    the judgment it is set out as follows:-

         "The Regulations give effect to the  United  Kingdom's  obligations
         under EU law to facilitate the free movement, not merely of workers
         and those who are self-employed,  but  also  those  who  are  self-
         sufficient together in each case with their  family  members.   The
         requirement that a person be self-sufficient is no less a matter of
         substance than a requirement that a person be  either  employed  or
         self-employed.  A  person  who  has  had  to  rely  on  the  United
         Kingdom's National Health Service is no more self-sufficient than a
         person whose resources are inadequate  so  that  he  may  become  a
         burden on the United Kingdom social assistance system."

37.  It is precisely because a self-sufficient person is  not  to  become  a
    burden on the state that the  requirement  for  comprehensive  sickness
    insurance is  made.   Therefore  no  answer  to  say  that  if  medical
    treatment is required that it can be accessed under the National Health
    Regulations.

38.  A similar sentiment was reflected in the decision of W China  where  it
    was held that in order to fulfil the requirements of  Directive  90/364
    there had to be a demonstration of a possession of  sickness  insurance
    and sufficient resources to avoid  becoming  a  burden  on  the  social
    assistance system of the  United  Kingdom.   The  court  in  that  case
    considered at length the question of sickness insurance.

39.  I find, therefore, that the approach taken by the Judge  to  the  issue
    of  comprehensive  sickness   insurance   was   fundamentally   flawed.



40.  In the circumstances therefore I find that the approach  taken  by  the
    Judge to the Regulations was flawed and in error of law, such  that  it
    should be set aside and the decision remade.

41.  The finding that  the  sponsor  was  not  self-sufficient  during  that
    period of April 2008 to January 2009 does not entirely dispose  of  the
    appeal as was recognised by the Judge in paragraph 43, there may be  an
    argument that she remains a job seeker for that period.  The Judge  did
    not make findings on that matter and left the matter somewhat open.

42.  In relation to the issue of Article 8 that was linked in  paragraph  44
    with the findings that were made that the claimant indeed  fell  to  be
    granted permanent leave to remain.  That finding clearly is vitiated by
    the error of law to which I have referred.

43.  Ms Appiah indicated that, in the event that I found an error of law  so
    as to set aside the decision, she would seek to argue that  the  spouse
    still fell to be considered as a job seeker for  the  purposes  of  the
    Regulations and would seek to develop that argument.

44.  In those circumstances having regard  to  paragraph  7  of  the  senior
    president's practice direction I shall send  the  matter  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for that issue to be determined.

45.  It is to be noted in any event that removal  of  the  claimant  is  not
    envisaged because at present he is entitled to  reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a family member of  an  EEA  national  currently  exercising
    treaty rights.  The real issue is whether or not he is entitled to  the
    permanent residence under the Regulations or not.

46.  Any further documentation or evidence relating to the issues which  are
    the subject of appeal should be sent to all parties no later than  five
    days prior to the hearing.
