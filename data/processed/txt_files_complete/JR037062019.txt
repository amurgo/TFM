 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.

JUDGE PERKINS: THIS IS  AN  APPLICATION  FOR  JUDICIAL  REVIEW  AGAINST  THE
    DECISION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE BY AN ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER  ON  3
    JANUARY 2019 UPHELD ON ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW ON 10 APRIL 2019  REFUSING
    THE APPLICANT ENTRY CLEARANCE TO THE UNITED  KINGDOM.   PERMISSION  WAS
    GRANTED ON THE PAPERS BY AN UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE.

2.    There are certain preliminary observations I need to  make.   Firstly,
    and this is trite but it is fundamental, I do remind myself  that  this
    is an application for judicial review.  I am not concerned with what  I
    would have done on the application for leave but whether the  Secretary
    of State has acted irrationally  in  the  sense  of  being  "Wednesbury
    unreasonable" and that is a high threshold.  This much, I think, is not
    in dispute.

3.    There is a dispute about  what  documents  actually  were  before  the
    Entry Clearance Officer at the relevant time.   Whether  that  is  best
    formulated as a dispute about "what documents were there" or  "what  is
    the relevant" time is not entirely clear  but  I  am  reminded  of  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in The  Queen  on  the  application  of
    Safeer v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
    2518 and particularly the observations of Lady Justice Nicola Davies at
    paragraph 19 where Her Ladyship said the basic rule  is  clear,  namely
    that where there is a dispute on the  evidence  in  a  judicial  review
    application, then in the absence of cross-examination the facts in  the
    defendants' evidence must be assumed to be correct.  That  is  a  tight
    rule and a hard one to dislodge.  There are exceptions but they do  not
    apply here and that is the approach I brought to this evidence.

4.    There have been previous  decisions  about  this  application.   There
    have been judicial review proceedings under JR 4982 of  2018  and  they
    were withdrawn upon the Secretary of State agreeing "to reconsider  his
    decision of 12 February 2018 within three months".  I am satisfied that
    this must mean reconsideration of the decision on 12 February  2018  on
    the information then available, not on the information that might  have
    been produced since.  I do not see how any construction other than that
    would permit it to be a reconsideration of the decision of 12  February
    2018 rather than a reconsideration of  another  decision  on  different
    material.  This is important and was a matter of  dispute  between  the
    parties but I hope my position is clear and  the  reasons  for  it  are
    sound.

5.    In very, very broad outlined terms, the applicant says that he  is  an
    entrepreneur, that he has expertise  in  the  manufacture,  supply  and
    fitting of products made from uPVC and that he spotted  a  gap  in  the
    market that he wants to exploit in the United  Kingdom.   The  relevant
    Rule is at paragraph 32 of HC 509 and it  is  a  requirement  that  the
    applicant shows that "the business can  realistically  be  expected  to
    support him and any dependant without the  need  to  take  employment".
    This Rule is very much less prescriptive than Rules that are  now  made
    in matters relating to entry clearance but that is the  test  that  the
    respondent had to apply.  It is not a requirement of the Rules that the
    application is supported with any particular business  plan  or  indeed
    anything else in the sense of a prescribed document but  the  applicant
    chose to produce a business  plan,  it  was  considered  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and it was found wanting.

6.    There are seven points of contention raised in  the  grounds.   It  is
    the applicant's case that his case was rejected irrationally.  I do not
    agree.  The first point  is  that  the  business  plan  and  supporting
    documentation did not distinguish between a large  order  and  a  small
    order and the Entry Clearance Officer found  this  significant  because
    the profitability of the operation depended on this distinction.  Small
    orders would be sourced in the United Kingdom, large orders sourced  in
    Turkey.  Without an explanation of  these  terms  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer,  in  my  judgment,  cannot  be  criticised  for  finding   the
    application deficient.  The grounds say that the words should be  given
    simply their literal meaning but, with respect, that just will not  do.
    These words do not have a literal  meaning.   They  have  a  contextual
    meaning and that meaning was not given.

7.    The second point concerns the applicant's relationship with a  concern
    in Turkey called Sabir Plastics.  It is the applicant's  case  that  he
    was a shareholder and, I think, director or similar  higher  managerial
    servant of that company, that he parted with his former  colleagues  on
    good terms and intended to use Sabir Plastics as a  major  supplier  of
    materials that he intended to use in the United Kingdom.   Really,  the
    applicant's case depends on Sabir Plastics being a viable concern.  The
    Entry Clearance Officer was not persuaded about that it was.

8.    The Entry Clearance Officer found two problems.  The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer had made enquiries in open  source  documents.   There  was  no
    website for Sabir Plastics and although the company was known to  exist
    because it had been filing accounts for the last three years it had not
    had to pay any tax.  The Entry Clearance Officer was surprised  at  the
    absence of any website and  deduced  from  the  absence  of  a  website
    together with the failure to pay any tax that the company was just  not
    doing very much, if anything at all.  Clearly it exists,  there  is  no
    doubt about that but the Entry Clearance Officer was not persuaded that
    it was a viable concern and that influenced the rest of the approach to
    the case.

9.    I do not see any objection that can be made  against  that.   Websites
    are now part and parcel of ordinary business at all sorts of levels and
    a company that has traded for three years without having to pay any tax
    is unlikely to be a major concern.  This is a point taken by the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and although the applicant very much disagreed I  see
    no fault in the reasons given for finding that it was  not  a  reliable
    source of supply  which  was  necessary  to  give  credibility  to  the
    application as a whole.

10.   The third point taken was that there  was  no  formal  agreement  with
    Sabir Plastics.  There was simply an indication of intent.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer took the view  that  this  was  of  such  fundamental
    importance to the whole project that the absence of a  more  formalised
    agreement was a factor that tended to undermine the  application  as  a
    whole.  This is rational.  It may not be the only view of the  evidence
    but it is a permissible view of the evidence.

11.   The fourth issue concerned the supply of materials from  Turkey.   The
    applicant had said that he could supply goods  cheaply  in  Turkey  and
    that getting them into the United Kingdom would only add between 1  and
    3% to the total cost.  That was something the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    felt able to check and the Entry Clearance Officer found that that  was
    not right.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  enquiries  revealed  that
    necessary duties from importing from outside the EU would add more than
    the 1 to 3% stated to the  overall  price.   This  is  something  which
    cannot now be checked because the website cannot be found but  this  is
    an example of an assertion made by the respondent that in  the  absence
    of a compelling reason to reject it I have to and do accept.  It  is  a
    further example of the plan not being satisfactory.

12.   The fifth point concerned the absence of firm suppliers in the  United
    Kingdom.  Some enquiries had been made to suggest  the  kind  of  firms
    that could provide business and provide  materials  but  there  was  no
    indication  that  there  was  any  willingness  to  create  a  business
    relationship and there are obvious questions to be asked there.  It may
    be that the kind of firms in the United Kingdom would be very happy  to
    deal with another supplier.  They may  regard  such  a  supplier  as  a
    competitor and a source that should not to be  encouraged.   I  do  not
    know, neither did the Entry Clearance Officer because the point was not
    addressed.  This is something which, again,  was  a  concern  that  was
    permissible.

13.   The sixth point is criticism about  the  overall  marketing  strategy.
    These are findings made  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  which  are
    clearly within his discretion.  There is nothing irrational  about  it.
    There was no clear definition between short-term and  long-term  goals.
    It was a feature of the case which did not impress the Entry  Clearance
    Officer.

14.   A similar point can be made about the analysis of  competitors,  which
    is the seventh issue.  The Entry Clearance Officer  was  not  satisfied
    proper regard had been had to the competition.  That  is  a  subjective
    judgment.  Again, it may not be the only  permissible  view  but  I  am
    wholly unpersuaded that it was one that was not open to  the  Secretary
    of State.

15.   There are two points here where the additional material that has  been
    found and may or may not have been before the Secretary of State to  be
    considered could be important, in my judgment, not as important  as  it
    might first seem, but the difficulties are a list from Sabir of  prices
    and a letter from Sabir about its intent to support the applicant.   It
    is only relevant if Sabir is a concern to be reckoned with and  I  have
    already indicated that the Entry Clearance Officer was entitled to find
    that it was not and that is not in any way changed by a purported price
    list and a purported notice of intent but I am not satisfied, or rather
    I am satisfied that this was not before  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    when the decision was made and  in  any  event,  it  is  simply  not  a
    relevant consideration.

16.   It follows therefore, individually  and  cumulatively,  the  applicant
    has failed to make out  the  criticisms  and  overall,  I  am  entirely
    satisfied that the decision was permissible on the  material  available
    and I dismiss the application for judicial review.

17.   The point was not developed in oral argument but it was  suggested  in
    the papers that the Secretary of State by the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    ought to have interviewed the applicant.  This is  unsustainable.   The
    obligation to interview, to the extent that it exists, is  set  out  in
    the terms of a policy  where  the  Secretary  of  State  says  that  an
    interview will be provided when a  matter  cannot  be  decided  on  the
    papers.  Here the Secretary of State decided that it could  be  decided
    on the papers and has reached a rational conclusion.  So, the interview
    argument, which was not addressed orally, in my judgment  adds  nothing
    to the case.

18.   That is the decision I have to make and that is my decision.
                                    Costs

19.   I award costs which the applicant will have  to  pay  in  the  sum  of
    �6,527

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

20.   I refuse permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal because I see  no
    error in my decision.
