Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. R Jesurum; Counsel instructed by Howe & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms. A Fijiwala; Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Beach
    promulgated on 3rd December 2014, in  which  she  dismissed  an  appeal
    against the respondent's decisions of 22nd November 2013 to refuse  the
    applications made by the appellants' for entry clearance to  settle  in
    the UK as the dependent sons of Mr Tekbahadur Phagami Pun.

 Background

 2. The appellants' are both  nationals  of  Nepal  and  the  sons  of  Mr.
    Tekbahadur Pun, who was enlisted on 13th January 1979 to the Brigade of
    Gurkhas.  The appellants' father was discharged  from  the  Brigade  of
    Gurkhas on 22nd November 1992 following a total  of  15  years  service
    that is described in his certificate of service as being 'Exemplary'.

 3. The appellants father entered the UK on 18th June 2011  with  his  wife
    and was granted settlement under  the  'Gurkha  policy',  as  a  former
    British Gurkha veteran.

 4. On 19th September 2013, the appellants applied for entry  clearance  to
    settle in the UK as the dependant's  of  their  father,  an  ex  Gurkha
    soldier.   Both  appellants  were  interviewed  by  telephone  on  13th
    November 2013 and both applications were refused for  the  reasons  set
    out in a Refusal of Entry Clearance  served  upon  each  appellant  and
    dated 22nd November 2011.

 5. In each case, the respondent was satisfied that the appellants' parents
    are present and settled in the UK, but the respondent was not satisfied
    that the appellants met the requirements set  out  in  the  immigration
    rules  for  entry  clearance  as  an  adult  dependant  relative.   The
    respondent considered the applications on Article 8 grounds and  stated
    "... I have seen nothing that would lead me to conclude that there  are
    particular bonds in your case that  would  lead  to  an  engagement  of
    Article 8(1) ...".  Notwithstanding  that  conclusion,  the  respondent
    went on to consider the remaining matters  relevant  to  an  Article  8
    assessment noting in each case:

         "If I am wrong on that count and Article 8 is engaged,  the  second
         question In Razgar would have  to  be  considered.  In  SG  (Nepal)
         [2012] UKUT 00265 it was held that it is not unreasonable to expect
         a sponsor to choose between living in their homeland with all their
         family or to come to the UK with only a part of it,  and  so  would
         answer the second question in the negative. Going  on  to  consider
         the question in Razgar the decision is a lawful one  and  satisfies
         the requirement of Article 8(2)  in  being  necessary  to  regulate
         inward migration. It is notable that when your parents came to  the
         UK they were aware that their adult children do  not  automatically
         qualify for settlement. They made their decision to settle in  that
         knowledge. I have given due weight in respect of the balancing that
         needs to be undertaken by entry clearance officers when considering
         Article 8(2) and the proportionality of the decision. If Article  8
         was engaged I would find that the decision is proportionate in  the
         exercise of immigration control and that the human rights  of  your
         family are not infringed.

         I acknowledge the historic injustice and its consequences  suffered
         by former members of the Brigade of Gurkhas are to  be  taken  into
         account. Because of the exceptional position  of  Gurkha  veterans,
         and their  families,  the  Secretary  of  State  has  made  special
         provisions for their entry to the UK outside the Immigration  Rules
         as an acknowledgment that it is in the public  interest  to  remedy
         the injustice.   However, there is no guarantee that  your  sponsor
         would have taken up the  opportunity  to  settle  immediately  upon
         discharge. You have grown up in Nepal. You are able  to  live  with
         your adult sibling in the family home in Nepal that you grew up in.
         Your parents chose to apply for  settlement  visas  when  you  were
         already an adult in the full knowledge that their adult children do
         not automatically qualify for settlement.  There is no bar to  your
         parents returning  to  Nepal  either  permanently  or  temporarily.
         Family  life  can  continue  as  it  may  have  done  and   without
         interference by this decision. Even If I am to accept that  refusal
         may be an interference with private life, I am not  satisfied  that
         you have established family life with your parents over  and  above
         that between an adult child and parents. Therefore, the decision is
         proportionate  to  maintain  the  Immigration   control   and   the
         legitimate aim pursued ..."

 6. The appellants appealed the refusal of entry clearance and  the  matter
    was reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager.   The  decision  to  refuse
    entry clearance was maintained.

 The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Beach

 7. It was uncontroversial that the appellants do not qualify for leave  to
    enter the UK under  the  immigration  rules.   The  appellants'  father
    attended the hearing of the appeal and gave evidence before the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.  The Judge records at paragraphs [7] to 22] of her
    decision the evidence that she heard and the submissions made on behalf
    of the parties.  At paragraphs [23] to [25] she refers to  the  leading
    authorities concerning the assessment of Article 8  claims  by  Gurkhas
    and the proper approach to the historic injustice suffered by them.

 8. At paragraph [28] of her decision, the Judge refers to the 5 stage test
    set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and at paragraph [29] notes:

         "The first matter to be considered is whether family  life  exists.
         If I find that family life does not exist, Article 8(1)  will  not,
         therefore, be engaged and that is the end of the appeal. If I  find
         that family life does exist and Article  8(1)  is  engaged  then  I
         must, of course, go on to consider the factors under  Article  8(2)
         including a proportionality assessment."

 9. The Judge found at paragraph [35] that the appellants  have  not  shown
    that they have a family life with their parents and that  Article  8(1)
    is therefore, not engaged.  Her reasons for  that  finding  are  to  be
    found at paragraphs [30] to [34]:

         "30.     The Appellants lived with their parents  until  2011  when
         their parents both came to the UK. The reason  why  the  Appellants
         did not apply at that time is given by the sponsor as being because
         the Appellants were in the middle of their studies and he had  been
         advised to enter the UK first and then apply for the Appellants  to
         join him in the UK.

         31.      There was then a further  delay  of  2  years  before  the
         Appellants made an application to join the sponsor and their mother
         in the UK. The reason given for this by the sponsor was that he had
         to collate the relevant documents and  this  took  some  time.  The
         relevant documents were not expanded on and it is entirely  unclear
         to me why it should take 2 years to collect these documents. It  is
         clear from the evidence from the employer that the sponsor had been
         working for that employer for almost 3 years.

         32.      The accommodation address given by the Appellants in their
         application  form  and  confirmed  by  the  sponsor  as  being  the
         accommodation arranged by him for the Appellants is an  address  in
         Reading. This is, of course, some distance from the  sponsor's  own
         accommodation which, admittedly, is in an expensive part of  London
         so it  would  seem  unlikely  that  he  would  be  able  to  afford
         accommodation in the exact same area for the  Appellants.  However,
         there are  matters  which  cause  me  some  concern  regarding  the
         Appellants' accommodation.  Firstly,  the  accommodation  has  been
         arranged in Reading and not simply another  part  of  London.  This
         suggests Appellants who  are,  in  effect,  autonomous  from  their
         parents. Secondly, the sponsor now states that he intends  to  find
         accommodation for the family as a whole after the Appellants arrive
         in the UK and that this was always his intention. However, this was
         not mentioned in the Appellants' application forms, the Appellants'
         interviews,  the  grounds  of  appeal  or  the  sponsor's   witness
         statement and was raised for the first time in an answer  given  in
         cross-examination.  Thirdly, if the sponsor's intention was  always
         to arrange accommodation  for  the  family  as  a  whole  when  the
         Appellants arrived in the UK I do not understand  why  he  did  not
         simply  arrange  this  accommodation  prior  to   the   Appellants'
         applications to show that they would be living as a family unit and
         that there would be adequate accommodation available. It cannot  be
         because of his employment (although this in itself  raises  queries
         because he is a caretaker and is presumably expected to  remain  on
         the premises yet at the same  time  talks  of  living  in  separate
         accommodation) because if his employment prevented him  from  doing
         this then he would not be able  to  do  so  after  the  Appellants'
         arrival in the UK either. I find that  this  explanation  has  been
         provided simply because this has now become an issue on the part of
         the Respondent and the sponsor  is  now  seeking  to  minimise  any
         damage to the Appellants' case and not because he had an  intention
         of arranging such accommodation at  the  time  of  the  Appellants'
         applications or decisions.

         33.       There  is  evidence  of  telephone  contact  between  the
         Appellants and the sponsor and the Appellants and their mother  but
         I would expect to see such  contact  when  the  Appellants  are  in
         another country and when  they  have  outstanding  applications  to
         enter the UK. I would also expect to see some degree  of  financial
         support to the Appellants given that they were studying or  working
         (in the case of the 1st Appellant) and are now unemployed. This  in
         itself is insufficient to create a  family  life  or  show  that  a
         family life exists.

         34.      The Appellants are young adults who were 26 years old  and
         30 years old at the time of the  application.  It  is  unusual  for
         children of that age not to have formed some life of their own. The
         circumstances of these particular Appellants point towards  exactly
         this. They are living  in  accommodation  which  was  formerly  the
         family home but which was sold to an uncle,  they  are  capable  of
         looking after themselves (as was evidenced in their interviews) and
         they had no plans to live with their parents in the UK or  to  live
         particularly near their parents. The 2nd Appellant has  not  worked
         in Nepal but said that he thought this was  because  his  education
         was weak and not because he was part of a family unit and  was  not
         expected to work. The 1st Appellant has  worked  as  a  waiter  and
         temporary helper in a restaurant previously for two years."

The Grounds of Appeal

10. The grounds of appeal advanced  by  the  appellants  concede  that  the
    appellants cannot meet the requirements of the immigration  rules,  and
    confirm that the application made by the appellants relied upon Article
    8 ECHR.  Broadly stated, the appellants advance four grounds:

          a. The Judge fails to refer to  material  authorities  concerning
             the assessment of Article 8 claims  relating  to  family  life
             between adults, and by failing to set out the  test  that  she
             applied in reaching her conclusion that  the  appellants  have
             not shown that they have a family life with their parents, the
             Judge deprives the appellants of the means of knowing how they
             fell short of it.  The test for family life requires more than
             the ordinary emotional ties, but dependence is  not  required.
             The Judge appears to discount previous cohabitation, continued
             residence in the family home, on-going contact  and  financial
             support. The reasons given by the Judge  do  not  explain  why
             family life is not present.

          b. The Judge fails to identify whether she accepts or rejects the
             evidence of the sponsor that he arranged the accommodation  in
             Reading, in advance because he believed he was required to  do
             so, but that his intention was to secure new accommodation for
             the whole family if the appellants are admitted.

          c. If  the  Judge  did  reject  the  sponsor's  evidence  of  his
             intention to live together with the appellants,  the  approach
             was unfair because it had never been claimed  previously  that
             the sponsor did not intend to cohabit with the appellants,  if
             they were admitted to the UK.  It is procedurally unfair for a
             finding to be made against a party who has never been  put  on
             notice or, nor been given a fair opportunity of dealing with a
             matter.

          d. The Judge  takes  into  account  an  irrelevant  matter.   The
             sponsor  was  under  no  requirement  to  have   accommodation
             arranged at the date of application.  To expect the Sponsor to
             secure accommodation in advance on a  speculative  application
             has no basis in the immigration rules, the Respondent's policy
             or the Article 8 case law.

11. Permission to appeal was refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Zucker) and the  Upper  Tribunal  (Deputy  Judge  Norton-Taylor).   The
    appellants claimed Judicial Review of the decision to refuse permission
    and following the grant of permission to claim Judicial  Review  by  Mr
    Justice Warby on 6th July 2015, permission to appeal was granted by the
    Vice President of the Upper  Tribunal,  Mr  C  M  G  Ockelton,  on  8th
    September 2015.

12. In granting permission to  claim  Judicial  Review,  Mr  Justice  Warby
    observed:

         "The Judge adopted the Razgar 5 stage approach, concluding that the
         appeal failed at the first stage. It  is  however  clear  from  the
         material supplied that there are real  issues  of  law  as  to  the
         precise tests for establishing the existence of a 'family life' for
         Article 8 purposes in this context. A particular question  is  what
         if any  degree  of  dependency,  of  what  nature  is  required  to
         establish a family life. Permission to appeal has been  granted  on
         these issues by the Court of Appeal and permission to review  a  UT
         decision has also been granted in another case. I would regard  the
         points of law raised by para 16 of the Grounds as arguable  points,
         on which the Claimants have reasonable prospects  of  success,  and
         points of principle of real importance..."

13.  The matter comes before me to consider whether or not the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Beach involved the making of a material error
    of law, and if the decision is set aside, to re-make the decision.



The hearing before me on 9th November 2015

14. At the hearing before me, Mr Jesurum relied upon the matters set out in
    his skeleton argument of 5th November 2015.  He submits  that  but  for
    the historic injustice, the appellants' father would have qualified for
    settlement earlier, and the appellants who would have  been  minors  at
    the time, would have been granted settlement in line  with  the  policy
    for minors published by the respondent.  He submits  that  the  sponsor
    had no fair opportunity to apply for  settlement  until  2009,  but  by
    then, the appellants had attained the age of majority.

15. Mr Jesurum submits that Article 8  creates  a  positive  obligation  to
    foster  the  development  of  family  life.    He  submits   that   the
    appellants'  Article  8  rights  and  those  of  the  Sponsor  and  the
    appellants' mother are engaged and that the  test for Article 8  family
    life between adults is  whether  "something  more  exists  than  normal
    emotional ties";  Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31.  He submits  that
    the following propositions are derived from the authorities:

          a. Kugathas has been interpreted too restrictively in  the  past;
             Ghising [2012] UKUT 160 at [56]

          b. Family life can exist without dependence;  Patel & Others  -v-
             ECO (Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ 17 at [14]

          c.  Voluntary separation does  not  end  family  life;   Sen  -v-
             Netherlands (2003) EHRR 7

          d. The attainment of the age of  majority  does  not  end  family
             life;  Etti Adegbola -v- SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1319 at [23]

          e. Critical features in assessing the existence  of  family  life
             are continued presence in the  family  home  and  whether  the
             dependant has established a family life of their  own.   These
             are sufficient to infer the existence of family  life;   AA  v
             The United Kingdom [2011] ECHR 80 at [49]

16. Mr Jesurum  submits  that  the  suggestion  in  Gurung  that  emotional
    dependence is a requisite, is obiter.  He  submits  that  there  are  a
    number of features in this case, that taken cumulatively, point to  the
    existence of a family life between the appellants' and their mother and
    father.  He draws my attention in  particular  to  the  fact  that  the
    appellants resided with their parents until  their  parents'  departure
    from Nepal and the family's determination to maintain family unity.  He
    draws my attention to the fact  that  the  appellants  were,  and  are,
    financially dependant  on  their  father  as  evidenced  by  the  money
    transfer receipts that were before the First-tier Tribunal.   He  draws
    my attention to the fact that the appellants' depended, and continue to
    depend on their father's support for their accommodation and  that  the
    appellants are close to their parents.

17. In the event that I find that there is an error of law in the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal, he submits that in  assessing  whether  any
    interference to the family  and  private  life  of  the  appellants  is
    proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to  be  achieved,  if
    all that is relied on in the public interest side of  the  balance  are
    the interests of immigration control, then "the weight to be  given  to
    the  historic  injustice  will  normally  require  a  decision  in  the
    Appellants' favour";  Ghising  and  others  (Ghurkas/BOC's  -  historic
    wrong - weight) [2013] UKUT 567.

18. The respondent opposes the appeal and has filed a Rule 24 response that
    was adopted by Ms Fijiwala at the hearing before me.   Insofar  as  the
    correct approach to the assessment of Article 8 claims between  parents
    and adult children is concerned, she draws my attention to the decision
    of the Court of Appeal in Singh -v- SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 630.

19. She submits that a proper reading of the decision makes it  plain  that
    the Judge properly directed herself as to the Article 8 claim and  made
    findings that were open  to  her  having  heard  the  evidence  of  the
    appellants' father.  She submits that the grounds of appeal amount to a
    disagreement with the findings made by the Judge and are an attempt  to
    re-open findings  that  were  properly  made.   She  submits  that  the
    decision does not contain any material error  of  law  and  the  appeal
    should be dismissed.

 Discussion

20. It is uncontroversial that the Tribunal must  first  determine  whether
    Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged at all. If it is not, the Tribunal has
    no jurisdiction to embark upon an assessment of  the  remaining  issues
    stages identified in Razgar.  If Article 8  is  engaged,  the  Tribunal
    should have gone on to consider the remaining four stages identified in
    Razgar.

21. As I have set out, the appeal was dismissed by the First-tier  Tribunal
    upon the finding of the Judge that the appellants' have not shown  that
    they have a family life with the sponsor and  their  mother,  and  thus
    Article 8 is not engaged.  It is that finding that is at the  heart  of
    the appeal before me,  and  the  grounds  of  appeal  advanced  by  the
    appellants.  It is right to note from the outset that that in  reaching
    her decision, the Judge referred to the decisions  in  Ghising  (family
    life - adults - Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 IAC  and  Ghising  and
    others (Gurkhas/BOC's:  historic  wrong:  weight)  [2013]  UKUT  005672
    (IAC), but did not set out or refer to any  of  the  other  authorities
    relevant to an assessment of family life between adults.

22. Ordinarily, a parent and an adult child would not  necessarily  acquire
    the protection of Article 8 without evidence  of  further  elements  of
    dependency, involving more than the normal emotional  ties.  Article  8
    protects the rights not only of the appellants but  also  their  family
    members and each case has to be assessed on its own particular facts.

23. In Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31, a Sri Lankan  asylum-seeker  had
    spent about 15 years living in Germany before coming to the UK in 1999.
    He claimed that he faced persecution in Sri Lanka and  that  whilst  in
    Germany he had enjoyed family life under Article  8  with  his  mother,
    brother and sister's family, who were  recognised  as  refugees  there.
    Since his arrival in the UK, he remained in touch with  his  family  by
    regular telephone calls and his sister's family had also visited him in
    the UK for a 3-week period. The  Court  of  Appeal  thought  that   the
    following passage in S v United  Kingdom [1984] 40  DR  196  was  still
    relevant:

         "... generally, the protection  of  family  life  under  Article  8
         involves cohabiting dependants, such as parents and their dependent
         minor children. Whether it extends to other  relationships  depends
         on the circumstances of the particular case. Relationships  between
         adults ... would not necessarily acquire the protection of  Article
         8 of  the  Convention  without  evidence  of  further  elements  of
         dependency, involving more than the normal emotional ties."

24. The Court of Appeal considered that the further element  of  dependency
    did not  have to be economic. Accordingly, it will be necessary to show
    that ties of support, either emotional or economic,  are  in  existence
    and go beyond the ordinary and natural ties  of  affection  that  would
    accompany a relationship of that kind.

25. A helpful review of the authorities, including those relied upon by the
    appellants in the appeal before me is to be found in  the  decision  of
    Sir Stanley Burnton in  Singh  -v-  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  630.   The
    appellants, both Indian nationals appealed against the Upper Tribunal's
    dismissal of their appeals against refusals of their  applications  for
    indefinite  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.    The
    appellants, together with their mother,  had  obtained  visas  to  join
    their father in the UK when aged 17 and 19 respectively.  Their  father
    and mother had returned to India to bring the appellant's three younger
    siblings to the UK, but the father died. The mother's  application  for
    indefinite  leave  to  remain  was   granted,   but   the   appellants'
    applications were refused  on  the  grounds  that  that  they  had  not
    established a family life with their mother in  the  UK  as  they  were
    living  independently.  On  appeal,  the  Tribunal  agreed   that   the
    appellants had not established a family life in the UK as there was  no
    evidence of dependency. It held that they  had  established  a  private
    life, having lived here for over three  years  and  having  established
    themselves as chefs in an Indian restaurant,  but  that  their  removal
    from the UK was justified and proportionate.  The appellants challenged
    the decision and claimed that the Upper Tribunal wrongly held that they
    had no family life for the purposes of Article 8.

26. Having carefully reviewed all of the relevant authorities, Sir  Stanley
    Burnton, with whom Lord Justice Clarke and Lord Justice Richard agreed,
    said:

         "24.     I do not think that the judgments to which I have referred
             lead to any difficulty in determining the correct approach  to
             Article 8 in cases involving adult children. In  the  case  of
             adults, in the context of immigration  control,  there  is  no
             legal or factual presumption as to the existence or absence of
             family life for the purposes of Article 8. I  point  out  that
             the approach of the European Commission for Human Rights cited
             approvingly in Kugathas did not  include  any  requirement  of
             exceptionality. It all depends on  the  facts.  The  love  and
             affection between an adult and his parents  or  siblings  will
             not of itself justify a finding of a family life. There has to
             be something more. A young adult living with  his  parents  or
             siblings will normally have a  family  life  to  be  respected
             under Article 8. A child  enjoying  a  family  life  with  his
             parents does not suddenly cease  to  have  a  family  life  at
             midnight as he turns 18 years of age. On  the  other  hand,  a
             young adult living independently of his parents may  well  not
             have a family life for the purposes of Article 8.

         25.      However, the debate as to the whether an applicant has  or
             has not a family life for the purposes of Article 8 is  liable
             to be arid and academic. In the  present  case,  in  agreement
             with Sullivan LJ's comment when refusing permission to appeal,
             the issue is indeed academic, and clearly so. As the  European
             Court of Human Rights pointed out in AA, in a judgment which I
             have found most helpful, the factors to be examined  in  order
             to assess proportionality are the same regardless  of  whether
             family or private  life  is  engaged.  The  question  for  the
             Secretary of State, the Tribunal  and  the  Court  is  whether
             those  factors  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  it  would  be
             disproportionate to  remove  the  applicant  from  the  United
             Kingdom.  I  reject  Mr  Malik's  submission  that  the  Upper
             Tribunal Judge's  assessment  of  proportionality  was  flawed
             because she, on his case wrongly, based it on the  Appellants'
             private life rather than their family and private life. In  my
             judgment, she took all relevant factors into account, and  her
             conclusion  on  proportionality  is  not  open  to  challenge.
             Indeed, I would go further.  In  my  judgment,  no  reasonable
             Tribunal, on the facts found, could properly have  come  to  a
             different conclusion.

         26.      However, for the sake of completeness, I add  that  in  my
             judgment the Judge correctly found that the Appellants had  no
             family life in this country to which Article 8  applies.  They
             are independent and working. Their siblings, who are  younger,
             are in India, and their mother understandably spends  as  much
             or more time in India than  in  this  country.  There  was  no
             evidence of anything beyond the  normal  bonds  of  affection,
             apart possibly from some financial support of  the  family  in
             India. That support cannot lead to a finding of a family  life
             in this country, which was the only family life for which  the
             Appellants contended.

27. In Ghising (family  life  - adults - Gurkha policy)  Nepal  [2012] UKUT
    160 (lAC) , Mrs Justice Lang DBE and Upper Tribunal Judge  Jordan  held
    that:

         "1.      A review of the jurisprudence discloses that there  is  no
         general proposition that Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on
         Human Rights can  never  be engaged when  the  family  life  it  is
         sought to establish, is between adult  siblings   living  together.
         Rather than  applying  a  blanket  rule   with   regard   to  adult
         children, each  case should  be analysed on   its  own   facts,  to
         decide whether or not family life exists,  within  the  meaning  of
         Article  8(1).   Whilst some  generalisations  are  possible,  each
         case is fact-sensitive.

         2. The historic injustice and its consequences suffered  by  former
         members of the Brigade of Gurkhas are to be taken into account when
         assessing proportionality under Article 8(2)  but  the  'historical
         wrong' was not as severe as that perpetrated upon British  Overseas
         Citizens and carries substantially less weight.    Because  of  the
         exceptional position of Gurkha veterans, and   their families,  the
         Secretary of State has made special provision for their   entry  to
         the UK outside the Immigration Rules as an acknowledgment  that  it
         is in the public interest to remedy the injustice.

         3. Given   that  the  Gurkhas  are  Nepali  nationals,  it  is  not
         inherently  unfair   or  in  breach   of  their  human  rights   to
         distinguish between  Gurkha  veterans,  their   wives   and   minor
         children on the one hand, who will generally be  given   leave   to
         remain,  and  adult  children on the other,  who will only be given
         leave to remain in exceptional circumstances.  The scheme that  the
         Secretary of State has  developed  is  capable  of  addressing  the
         historical wrong and contains within it a flexibility that, in most
         cases, will avoid conspicuous unfairness."

28. Finally, in paragraphs 45 and 46 of Gurung & Ors, R (on the application
    of) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 8 the Court of Appeal said:

         "45.     Ultimately, the  question  whether  an  individual  enjoys
         family life is one of fact and depends on a  careful  consideration
         of all the relevant facts of  the  particular  case.    Ms  McGahey
         submits, therefore, that the case law, both domestic and  European,
         can be of only limited assistance.  She (rightly)  accepts    that,
         as  a   matter   of   law,   in   some  instances  an  adult  child
         (particularly if  he does  not  have  a partner  or   children   of
         his  own) may establish that he has a family life with his parents.
          It all depends on the facts.

         46.      We think that the cases are of some assistance to decision-
         makers and tribunals who have to decide these issues. Paras  50  to
         62 of the determination of the UT  in  Ghising  contains  a  useful
         review of some of the jurisprudence and the correct approach to  be
         adopted.   It concludes at para 62 that 'the different outcomes  in
         cases with superficially similar features emphasises to us that the
         issue  under  Article  8(1)  is  highly   fact�   sensitive'.   The
         correctness of the UT's review has not been doubted before  us.  We
         endorse it.   We doubt whether any  useful  purpose  is  served  by
         further general elaboration."

29. The evidence of the appellant's father before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    is set out at paragraphs [9] to [15] of  the  decision  and  I  do  not
    repeat it here.  As I have set out previously, the Judge found that the
    appellants have not shown that they have a family life with the sponsor
    and their mother and that Article 8(1) is not engaged for  the  reasons
    set out at paragraphs [30] to [34].

30. There is no requirement for a Judge to set  out  all  of  the  material
    authorities in the course of a decision, provided that a proper reading
    of the decision demonstrates that the Judge applied the relevant  legal
    principles correctly.  On its own I would not have  found  the  Judge's
    failure to refer to the material authorities concerning the  assessment
    of Article  8  claims  relating  to  family  life  between  adults,  to
    establish an error of law.  All of the authorities make it  plain  that
    the assessment is entirely fact sensitive, but  that  of  course  means
    that a Judge must make findings upon the material issues.

31. There is a legal duty upon a Judge to give a brief explanation  of  the
    conclusions on the central issues on which the appeal is determined.  I
    accept that such reasons need not be extensive if  the  decision  as  a
    whole makes sense, having regard to the material accepted by the judge.
    A decision may contain an error of law where the  requirement  to  give
    adequate reasons are not met.  The Upper Tribunal  would  not  normally
    set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal where there has been no
    misdirection of law, or the fact-finding process cannot be criticised.

32. I have to say that in reading paragraphs [30] to [34] of  the  decision
    it is difficult to establish whether the Judge is simply  reciting  the
    evidence before her, or making findings upon that evidence.  The  Judge
    does not in terms, state whether she accepts or rejects the appellants'
    account of the family life that the appellants' claim,  exists  between
    them and their parents.  One might infer from what  is  said  in  those
    paragraphs that the Judge believed those factors to weigh  against  the
    appellants but I have some sympathy with the  first  ground  of  appeal
    advanced by the appellant that the Judge deprives the appellants of the
    means of knowing how they fell short of the test,  that  has  not  been
    identified, that the Judge applied.  In my judgment,  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal discloses a material error of  law  and  I  set
    aside the decision.

33. Directions were issued to the parties in advance of the hearing  before
    me requiring the parties to prepare for the hearing on the basis  that,
    if the Upper Tribunal decides to set aside  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, any further evidence, including supplementary oral
    evidence, that the Upper Tribunal may need to consider if it decides to
    re-make the decision, can be so considered at that hearing. No  further
    evidence was relied upon by the appellants and there was no application
    made pursuant to rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.

34. In re-making the decision, I remind myself that  the  appellant's  rely
    solely upon Article 8.  The first question to be addressed  where  only
    human rights grounds are advanced, is whether Article 8 of the ECHR  is
    engaged at all.

35. The decision in Ghising (family  life  - adults  -  Gurkha  policy)  is
    authority for the proposition that, where there is an interference with
    family life sufficient to engage Article  8(1),  recognition  that  the
    family has been the victim  of  a  "historic  injustice"  may  well  be
    relevant, in some cases highly relevant, when  the  proportionality  of
    that interference is considered under Article 8(2), but, first it  must
    be shown that there is family life for the purposes of Article  8,  and
    that  the  interference  with  it  (or  lack  of  respect  for  it)  is
    sufficiently serious to engage the potential operation  of  Article  8.
    The "historic injustice" has no  bearing  on  that  prior  question  of
    whether the appellants enjoy "family life" for the purposes of  Article
    8.

36. It is a question of fact in each case,  whether  relationships  between
    adult relatives disclose sufficiently strong  ties,  such  as  to  fall
    within the scope of Article 8.  As Sir Stanley Burnton noted in  Singh,
    there is no legal or factual presumption as to the existence or absence
    of family life for the purposes of Article 8. The  love  and  affection
    between an adult and his parents will not of itself justify  a  finding
    of a family life. There has to be something more.  Appellants' such  as
    these, do not stop enjoying a family  life  with  their  parents,  upon
    attaining the age of 18.  Equally, a person outside the United  Kingdom
    may have a good claim under Article 8 to be allowed to enter the United
    Kingdom to join family members  already  here  so  as  to  continue  or
    develop existing family life: Sen -v- Netherlands (2001) 36 EHRR 7.

37. In re-making  the  decision,  I  remind  myself  that  it  is  for  the
    appellants to discharge the burden of proof and the  relevant  standard
    of proof is the balance of probabilities.

38. I have had regard to the two bundles that were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The respondent's bundle included the  applications  made  by
    the appellants and the documents  relied  upon  by  the  appellants  in
    support  of  the  application.   The  appellants'  bundle  included   a
    statement made jointly by  the  appellants',  a  statement  from  their
    father and various other documents that  I  do  not  list  but  I  have
    carefully considered.

39. The appellants filed a joint statement dated October 2014 in support of
    their appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.  Insofar as is material to
    the issue before me, they stated:

         "2.      When our parents settled in the UK first  on  18/06/11  we
             did not intend to be separated as  a  close  family  for  this
             long. Our father worked hard to raise the necessary visa  fees
             and to be able to produce evidence of  adequate  accommodation
             and maintenance in support of our applications ...

         4. We are both totally dependent emotionally and  financially  upon
             our parents. At every stage  of  our  lives  our  parents  are
             always there for us. We both finished  our  studies  in  Nepal
             before our parents settled in the UK on 18/06/11.  Our  father
             had paid for all our studies.

         5. We are single, not working or studying. We have  tried  to  find
             work in Nepal but there are very limited job opportunities. It
             is almost impossible to get a job if we do not  have  personal
             connections or high level work experience.

         6. We rely on the money transfers our parents send us  every  month
             (approximately  �150)  to  cover  our  rent  and   our   daily
             requirements. Our father has been working hard in the  UK  for
             almost 3 years. He has not been able to take time  off  or  to
             visit us in Nepal so that he can continue to transfer as  much
             funds as possible to us.

         7. Our father continues to receive his  army  pension  which  still
             gets paid into his Standard Chartered bank in  Nepal.  He  has
             also used this income to support us both.

         8.  Our  father  has  worked  hard  to  provide  us  with  adequate
             accommodation and maintenance in the UK. He has been living in
             work accommodation with our mother and rented a separate  room
             for us stay when we applied for settlement visas.

         9. Our brother Subash continues to work and live in Dubai.  He  had
             to leave Nepal to find work.

         10.      Our parents use mobile phone cards to  telephone  us  both
             dally. The telephone reception is very bad In Nepal so  It  is
             sometimes difficult to talk."

40. The First-tier Tribunal also  had  before  it,  the  statement  of  the
    appellants' father, dated 27th October 2014.  In his witness  statement
    he stated:

         "4.      My 2 sons are single, not working or  studying.  They  are
             completely emotionally and financially dependent  on  my  wife
             and me. They were in the same dependent  situation  before  my
             wife and I left Nepal and we did not believe that we would  be
             separated for so long after we settled in the UK first.

         5. I have been working full time for almost  3  years.  I  use  the
             income from my paid work (approximately �1550 pm gross) and my
             army pension (approximately �180 pm) to support my 2  sons  in
             Nepal. I have not taken any holiday in order  to  be  able  to
             provide my sons with the most support. I have worked  hard  to
             be in a position to apply for their ILE in the UK as my  adult
             dependent  relatives  and  to  appeal  the  refusal  of  their
             applications.

         6. I transfer monthly money to my sons  to  cover  their  rent  and
             living expenses. They have no other income of their own and it
             is almost impossible for them to find jobs in  Nepal.  My  son
             Subash left Nepal and applied for a visa which allows  him  to
             live and work in Dubai.

         7. My wife and I telephone our 2 sons daily in Nepal  using  Lebara
             telephone cards. My wife does not work and  she  suffers  from
             poor health. It is very painful for us all to be separated  as
             a family so long. We have always been there for sons at  every
             stage of their lives and we miss them a lot."

41. The appellants produced a statement of account in respect of a Standard
    Chartered bank account held  by  the  appellants'  father,  into  which
    pension credits are  made  monthly.  The  statement  of  account  shows
    monthly pension credits for the twelve months between October 2013  and
    September 2014, but the only withdrawals shown are in  respect  of  the
    "Tax on interest".  Statements  relating  to  a  'Lloyds  Bank  Classic
    Vantage' account in the name of the appellant's father were also before
    the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  statements  disclose  the  income  and
    expenditure of the appellants' father but do not disclose  any  regular
    payments made to the appellants' through the bank account.

42. The appellants' bundle did include a number of money transfer  receipts
    evidencing international payments  made  to  the  appellants  by  their
    father.  Similarly, the respondent's bundle that was before the  First-
    tier Tribunal also  contained  a  number  of  money  transfer  receipts
    evidencing international payments  made  to  the  appellants  by  their
    father.  The money transfer receipts establish regular payments made to
    the appellants by their father between October 2012 and 2014.

43. The appellants' bundle also included a number of 'Sainsbury's' receipts
    evidencing the purchase of  Lebara  mobile  phone  top-up  vouchers  to
    support of claim  by  the  appellants  of  frequent  telephone  contact
    between them and their parents.

44. I have also noted the evidence of the appellants' father before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Beach recorded at paragraphs [10] to  [14]  of  her
    decision.

45. Having carefully considered all of the  evidence  and  the  submissions
    made before me, in the end I have come to the conclusion  that  in  the
    particular circumstances of these  appeals,  the  appellants  have  not
    shown that they have a family life with their parents, from  whom  they
    have lived apart, since 2011.  The reasons for my conclusion are:

          a. I accept that the appellants lived with  their  parents  until
             their parents  left  for  the  UK  in  2011.  They  were  aged
             approximately 29 and  24  respectively  at  that  time.   They
             undoubtedly enjoyed a family life with  their  parents  whilst
             they were growing up and completing their education.  I do not
             regard that family life to have been  suddenly  cut  off  when
             they reached the age of majority.  However, on any  view,  the
             appellants were adults at the time  that  their  parents  left
             Nepal and they could not have had  any  expectation  that  the
             appellants would be able to join them in the  UK.    I  accept
             that their parents and the appellants may well have hoped that
             they would be able to do so, but I find  that  the  appellants
             remained in Nepal as independent adults capable of  living  on
             their own.

          b. The appellants have been separated from  their  parents  since
             2011 and whilst  they  maintain  regular  contact  with  their
             parents, they are now young adults who were 30 and 26  at  the
             time of their applications.  As adults who have  looked  after
             themselves since their parents have been away, I find that the
             appellants will have established  their  life  as  independent
             adults on their own, in Nepal.

          c. Even after the appellants' parents had established  themselves
             in the UK, there was  a  delay  of  about  two  years  in  the
             appellants   making   their   application.    Their   father's
             explanation for this delay before the First-tier Tribunal  was
             that he had to collate the relevant documents.  He had however
             been working for some considerable time before the application
             was made and I do not accept the explanation provided for  the
             delay.  In my judgment, it is more likely that  there  was  no
             immediate need for  an  expeditious  application  because  the
             appellants  were  quite  able  to  live   by   themselves   as
             independent adults, in Nepal in the absence of their parents.

          d. There is no evidence before me that the appellants are in  any
             way vulnerable. Such evidence as there is before me about  the
             appellants living arrangements, is  that  the  two  appellants
             live together in the property that was formerly owned by their
             father, but which is now owned by their uncle. The  appellants
             pay a monthly rent of 3500 NRs, per calander month,  and  they
             share the kitchen, lounge and bathroom.  There is no  evidence
             to the effect that this living arrangement  is  precarious  or
             likely was available in the short  term  only.   There  is  no
             evidence that the appellants are vulnerable in any  way,  such
             that they have a particular dependence that can only be met by
             their parents.

          e. The evidence of the appellants and their father  is  that  the
             appellants' are  completely  emotionally  dependent  on  their
             parents.  I do not accept that they are. The  appellants  have
             now lived apart from their parents since 2011.  I am  prepared
             to accept that the appellants have the normal  emotional  ties
             that  might  be  expected  between  parents  and  their  adult
             children, but such emotional ties are not sufficiently strong,
             so as to fall within the scope of Article 8.

          f. The evidence of the appellants and their father  is  that  the
             appellants' are  completely  financially  dependent  on  their
             parents. There is evidence before me of international payments
             being made by  the  appellants'  parents  to  the  appellants,
             covering a period of about 24 months between October 2012  and
             October 2014..  In my judgment although the money sent to  the
             appellants  by  their  parents  establishes  an   element   of
             dependency, it is not one  which  in  my  judgment  takes  the
             matter very far. The provision of such money can be as much an
             insulation against family life as evidence of it.  Beyond  the
             explanation in their witness  statement  that  the  appellants
             have tried to find work in Nepal but there  are  very  limited
             job opportunities, there is no explanation as to  why  neither
             appellant has  sought  to  further  their  studies  or  secure
             employment to support themselves.  Such  financial  dependency
             that they have upon their father appears to be one of choice.

          g. There is no evidence before me that the  appellants  as  young
             healthy males, could not  support  themselves  financially  if
             they chose to do so.  Their brother Subash  who  was  born  on
             27th  September  1985  and  so  is  younger  than  the   first
             appellant, but older than the second appellant, has been  able
             to do so, albeit away from Nepal.

          h. The first  appellant  completed  his  education  in  2000  and
             obtained a Senior Level  Certificate.   That  was  before  his
             parents left Nepal.  He worked temporarily  as  a  waiter  but
             that employment appears to have  come  to  an  end,  when  the
             business closed. His dependence upon  his  parents  will  have
             diminished when he was working, and to some extent capable  of
             supporting himself.  The second appellant completed a Bachelor
             degree in Business Studies in  2011  and  has  not  worked  in
             Nepal.

          i. The appellants' both live together and there  is  no  evidence
             that they are unable, as independent adults, to  manage  their
             lives.

          j. Although some family life inevitably remains  between  parents
             and children, there comes a time when it  becomes  weak.   The
             appellants have now lived  apart  from  their  parents  for  a
             number of years  and  had  done  so,  at  the  time  of  their
             applications.   Although  they  remain  in  regular  telephone
             contact with their parents, they have not physically seen each
             other since the appellants' parents arrived in the UK in 2011.



46. It is a question of fact in each case,  whether  relationships  between
    adult relatives disclose sufficiently  strong  ties  such  as  to  fall
    within the scope of Article 8. Having carefully considered all evidence
    before me I find that any family life which  the  appellants  had  with
    their parents diminished after their parents arrival in the UK in 2011.
    In my judgment the appellants had not been exercising family life for a
    lengthy period by the time of their applications and such  family  life
    as has remained between the appellants and their parents, has  weakened
    with the passage of time.

47. In my judgment  the  relationship  between  the  appellants  and  their
    parents is one between adult relatives that discloses nothing different
    from what might be expected between such relatives.  It is unsurprising
    that the appellants are in regular  contact  by  telephone  with  their
    parents, or that the appellant's father assists them financially whilst
    they are not working.  The appellants had already attained the  age  of
    majority when their parents left for the UK.  The appellants have lived
    alone as adults, since their parents departure and in light of the fact
    that they were able to do  so  for  a  number  of  years  before  their
    applications were made, it seems to me that it is not possible  to  say
    that there has either been an interference with family life, or a  lack
    of respect for family life, which amounts to a breach of Article 8.

48. Looking at the matter through the five Razgar questions, in my judgment
    the appellants have not shown that they have a family life  with  their
    parents and as such their appeal fails at the first hurdle.

Decision:

49. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

50. I set aside the decision and re-make the decision  in  the  appeal.   I
    dismiss the appeal.
