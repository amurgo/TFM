Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Iqbal Counsel instructed by Britain Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mr Ehtasham Khalid date of birth 16 November 1988  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.  Having considered all the circumstances I do  not
    make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the appellant against the determination of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge S Aziz, whereby the judge dismissed the appellant's
    appeal against the decisions of the respondent dated 20th May 2014. The
    decisions by the respondent were to refuse the appellant further  leave
    to remain in the UK and thereupon to remove the appellant from the  UK.
    The appellant had applied for further leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur under paragraph 245 DD of the Immigration  Rules  and  the
    Points Based System.

 3. By decision made on the 30th April 2015 leave to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted. Thus the matter appears before me to determine in
    the first instance whether or not there is a material error of  law  in
    the original determination.

Immigration History

 4. The appellant had first entered the UK on the 2nd December  2006  as  a
    student with leave valid until the 13th March 2008. His leave had  been
    extended at various times [as a student 12th March  2008  to  31st  May
    2011; 20th June 2011 to 30th January 2014] and thereafter as a  Tier  1
    (Post study Migrant)] until 27th March 2014. The appellant made  an  in
    time application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).

 5. The appellant was interviewed in respect of that application on the 7th
    May 2014.

 6. By decision made on the 20th May 2014 the appellant's application as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) was refused.  In  refusing  the  application  the
    respondent found that the appellant did not meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245 DD.

Issues in the case

 7. To the benefit of the appellant Judge S Aziz made a number of  findings
    of fact such that the appellant satisfied a number of issues raised  in
    the refusal letter.

 8. The appellant's representative submitted that  the  only  issues  still
    material were those under paragraph  245DD(i)  -subparagraph  (ii)  the
    viability and credibility of the  source  of  the  money   required  in
    accordance with Table 4  of  Appendix  A  and  subparagraph  (iii)  the
    viability and credibility of the appellant's business plan  and  market
    research into the chosen sector for the business.

 9. The respondent's representative pointed out that the Letter of  Refusal
    had  raised  a  number  of  other  requirements  of  paragraph  245  DD
    specifically subparagraphs (iv) and (v). The appellant's representative
    submitted that the subparagraphs (iv) and (v) had  been  considered  by
    the judge and findings to the benefit of the appellant had been made in
    respect thereof.

10. During the hearing before me the version of  the  rules  applicable  to
    this application was raised. One version of the rules required  that  a
    proper business plan to be produced. The earlier version of  the  rules
    did not have such a stipulation. Given the date of the application  and
    decision, I apply the earlier version, an approach which appears to  be
    consistent with the wording of the refusal letter and the  approach  of
    the judge.

11.  The appellant's representative  submitted  that  the  judge  had  made
    findings to the benefit of the appellant on all the requirements of the
    rules save for subparagraphs (ii)  and  (iii)  as  set  out  above.  In
    respect of subparagraph (ii) the representative pointed  out  that  the
    judge considered the relevant evidence from paragraph 45 to 56.

12. The judge had in investigating the sources of the appellant's  finances
    set out where contributions to the total had come from according to the
    bank account. It was submitted that  the  judge  had  however  got  the
    evidence wrong. The judge had in paragraph 50 ascribed  specific  funds
    to bank  transfers  from  specific  accounts  relying  on  the  details
    contained in the appellant's Standard Charter Bank Statements (SCBS)  .
    However on close examination of the details recorded by the  judge  the
    sources for the funds and the accounts from which they emanate have not
    been accurately recorded. The judge clearly has the  misread  the  bank
    records.

13. It is  suggested  that  the  judge  has  made  further  errors  in  his
    assessment of the evidence. It is suggested that the judge has  misread
    the interview record and wrongly concluded that the appellant's brother
    was to be a silent partner.  This  is  from  the  interview  record  at
    question 25. There the appellant states at the last section:-

         "... And the 2nd financially , just in case I need more finance  to
         fund my business I have a silent investment which is  worth  ï¿½30000
         with my brother in Pakistan and in and further finance to  fund  my
         business I can bring that fund to the UK to support my business."

14. If the interview record was the source for alleging  that  the  brother
    was to be a silent partner then the judge appears to have  misread  the
    interview. However if one examines paragraph 29 and 30 of the  decision
    it is clear that the judge has read the interview record correctly  and
    what the judge was referring to  there  was  the  appellant's  evidence
    before the judge that his brother would be a silent partner, which  the
    appellant appears subsequently to have retracted.

15. The appellant's representative argued that the  errors  in  respect  of
    subparagraph (ii) could not be considered in isolation and that  errors
    impacted on the whole of the fact finding approach  by  the  judge.  He
    also submitted that the requirements of paragraph 245DD (i) had  to  be
    considered as a whole and not as individual elements.

16. That appears to ignore the fact that a  failure  to  meet  one  of  the
    elements of 245DD would be fatal to an application even  if  the  other
    requirements were met. Whilst clearly a legally incorrect  approach  to
    the fact finding in  one  element  may  impact  on  findings  in  other
    elements,  it  still  has  to  be  acknowledged  that   where   legally
    justifiable reasons are given for finding that the  appellant  has  not
    met  the  requirements  of  one  element  the  application  has  to  be
    dismissed.

17. In that regard whilst the judge's findings in respect  of  subparagraph
    (ii) may impact on the findings with regard  to  subparagraph  (iii)  I
    have to consider whether the findings in respect of subparagraph  (iii)
    are undermined by earlier findings of fact or are sustainable.

18. Subparagraph (iii) relates to the  viability  and  credibility  of  the
    applicant's business plan and market research into the chosen  business
    sector. The judge deals with  the  issue  from  paragraph  57  onwards.
    Firstly the appellant had not submitted a formal business plan.  Whilst
    there was no requirement to do so, such would have been useful evidence
    with regard to the appellant's business. The judge therefore looked  at
    the documents submitted and the evidence given.

19. In this regard there is no suggestion of inaccuracy in respect  of  the
    evidence recorded. A business contract had been submitted and the judge
    had carefully considered  the  contract.  The  judge  has  given  valid
    reasons for finding that this  was  not  a  genuine  civil  engineering
    contract which  related  to  several  months  of  work.  The  judge  in
    paragraphs 57 to 61 has given detailed reasons for  that  finding.  The
    conclusions in respect of this requirement  are  not  affected  by  the
    inaccurate evidential approach in respect of the bank accounts and  the
    other matters set out above. The finding that  this  was  not  a  valid
    civil engineering contract was a finding of fact the judge was entitled
    to make on the basis of the evidence and  which  the  judge  has  fully
    justified on a careful analysis of the evidence.

20. The judge then  considers  other  evidence  relating  to  the  business
    activity of the appellant.  In  paragraphs  62  the  judge  deals  with
    inconsistent evidence of minimum payments; in paragraph 63 the issue of
    a contract between the appellant and Kaybridge Construction;  paragraph
    64 the invoices  submitted  and  the  receipts  and  anomalies  on  the
    receipts.  In respect of each item the judge has  given  valid  reasons
    for the findings made. Finally in paragraph 66 the judge has dealt with
    minor anomalies which in themselves would not be determinative but when
    added to  the  other  factors  taken  into  account  in  assessing  the
    viability and credibility of the business and the market  research  the
    judge was entitled to take into account.

21. Having considered the details given  under  this  heading  the  judge's
    findings are sustainable in themselves and are not impacted upon by the
    findings in respect of subparagraph (ii). For the reasons set  out  the
    judge's decision in respect of subparagraph  (iii)  are  justified  and
    sustainable. The judge was entitled to find that the appellant does not
    meet all the requirements of paragraph 245 DD(i) subparagraph (iii).

22. Accordingly whilst the judge may have made errors in assessing specific
    parts of the evidence  the  judge  has  justified  the  conclusions  in
    respect  of  subparagraph  (iii)  and  therefore  any  errors  are  not
    material.

23. In the grounds of appeal issue is taken  with  regard  to  the  judge's
    approach to Article 8. There was no evidence of any family life in  the
    UK put before the judge. The only elements of private  life  that  were
    put  before  the  judge  related  to  the  appellant's  business.   The
    Immigration Rules clearly had provisions under which the appellant as a
    business man could remain in the UK. There is nothing  otherwise  under
    Private life that warrants Article 8 being engaged.

24. Even if private life may be engaged and there had to be  an  assessment
    of such private life, in assessing private life given  that  the  rules
    cover all aspects of private life advanced by the appellant I would not
    have  considered  the  aspects  of  private  life  advanced   warranted
    consideration under article 8. Even if I am wrong with regard  to  that
    and the decision interferes with such, the decision  is  in  accordance
    with the law and for the purpose of maintaining immigration control. As
    a final matter given the provisions in the  rules  and  all  the  other
    factors I would in  any  event  have  found  that  the  decisions  were
    proportionately justified.

25. For the reasons set out there is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision and I uphold the  decision  to  dismiss  this  appeal  on  all
    grounds
