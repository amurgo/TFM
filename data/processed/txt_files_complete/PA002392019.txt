For the Appellant:     Miss Heidar (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Chana promulgated on the 7th March 2019.

   2. At the Upper Tribunal hearing before me, the Appellant was represented
      by Miss Heidar of Counsel, and the Secretary of State was  represented
      by Mr Melvin, the Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

   3. The appeal before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chana  was  the  second
      asylum appeal brought by the Appellant. The Appellant's  first  asylum
      appeal had been dismissed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mays  in  a
      decision dated the 6th October 2015 who found that there was no active
      blood feud which would put  the  Appellant  at  risk  upon  return  to
      Afghanistan and that he could be returned safely to that country.

   4. Judge Chana noted at paragraph 29 of her decision that "the  basis  of
      the Appellant's claim before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  he
      feared persecution and ill-treatment in Afghanistan because of a blood
      feud, he has no relatives in Afghanistan, he  is  a  Shia  Muslim  and
      because of the general country situation.  This is the very same claim
      in this appeal.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge stated that the  murder
      took place and the person suspected of the  murder  was  arrested  and
      detained.   After  a  thorough  investigation  of  the  evidence,  the
      objective evidence and the documents provided by the  Appellant  about
      the blood feud, the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that  the  killing
      took place in October 2013 and it was the last  and  indeed  the  only
      killing.  The Judge found that the Appellant is  not  a  member  of  a
      family involved in an active blood feud and therefore will not come to
      any harm on these bases".

   5. Judge Chana found that in paragraph 30 that

           "30.  I therefore find that the Appellant is essentially relying
           on the same facts which have already been  the  subject  of  the
           previous determination of the First-tier Tribunal who  found  at
           the  date  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision,  that  the
           Appellant does not have a well-founded fear  of  persecution  in
           Afghanistan and could be returned safely.  I take as my starting
           point  that  this  is  the  authority  of  assessment   of   the
           Appellant's status as at the time  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge's decision which was heard on the 11th September 2015.

           31.   I find that the question that I  now  have  to  decide  is
           whether at the present  point  in  time,  after  the  First-tier
           Tribunal's decision, the situation is  such  that,  taking  into
           account the current situation in Afghanistan, the United Kingdom
           would  be  in  breach  of  its  obligations  under  the  Refugee
           Convention and Humanitarian Protection if it were to return  the
           Appellant to Afghanistan".

   6. The Judge noted at paragraph 33 that the Skeleton Argument argued that
      the  core  of  the  Appellant's  claim  had  been  accepted   in   the
      Respondent's refusal letter and that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      previously had refused the Appellant's appeal on the ground  that  she
      believed that he could relocate to Kabul on the basis that there is no
      evidence to show the Appellant had  initiated  contact  with  the  Red
      Cross and he had a paternal uncle living in Afghanistan.  Judge  Chana
      noted  that  within  the  Skeleton  Argument  it  was  said  that  the
      Appellant's fear was based on fears  on  his  integration  based  upon
      being a Shia Muslim was not considered by the First-tier Tribunal  and
      that the Respondent had between paragraphs 14 and 17  of  the  refusal
      letter stated that Shia Muslims  are  targeted  in  Afghanistan.   She
      noted that it was argued on behalf of the Appellant  that  the  First-
      tier Tribunal's decision was now three years old and  that  there  was
      evidence and factors which were not considered by the  previous  Judge
      and that the Appellant had now tried to contact his family through the
      Red Cross who confirmed that his family  could  not  be  traced.   She
      noted it was being argued that the Appellant had no contact  with  his
      paternal uncle and therefore he would be at  risk  upon  return.   The
      Appellant was arguing that the Respondent  had  not  carried  out  any
      attempts to trace the Appellant's family as set out in the case of  KA
      and the Respondent's duty did not end when the Appellant turned 18.

   7. However, Judge Chana found at paragraph 36 onwards that there  was  no
      background evidence which stated  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  was
      returning from the United Kingdom would put him at risk and that he is
      now an adult and in good health.  She found that he does in fact  have
      an uncle in Kabul and that the previous First-tier Tribunal was of the
      same opinion that the Appellant did have an uncle in Kabul and had not
      found his evidence credible that he would not be able to  contact  him
      upon return.  Judge Chana stated that the  previous  Judge  had  found
      that that business partner would be able to assist the Appellant  upon
      returning to Afghanistan.  Judge Chana also found that the Appellant's
      sister's husband had been  supporting  the  Appellant  in  the  United
      Kingdom and could continue to do so until he settled down and found  a
      job in Afghanistan.

   8. At paragraph 37, Judge Chana stated

           "37.  The Appellant's sister returned to Afghanistan in 2012 for
           a holiday.  I do not find it  credible  that  she  would  go  to
           Afghanistan for a holiday, a country which the Appellant  claims
           is dangerous, if she and her  husband  had  no  family  in  that
           country to visit.  I find that the Appellant  does  have  family
           and others in Afghanistan who will assist him in settling  down.
           I have considered the evidence that the Appellant  went  to  the
           Red Cross who said that they cannot trace his family.  That does
           not mean that he does not have any family  there.   Even  if  he
           does not have any family in Kabul, the Appellant will be able to
           find employment and settle down.

           38.   As to the issue of sufficiency of protection,  I  bear  in
           mind that in general if a person cannot establish a real risk of
           serious harm, the question of whether there is a sufficiency  or
           insufficiency of protection against that harm does not arise.  I
           find that it would be reasonable and not unduly  harsh  for  the
           Appellant to do so.  The Appellant is an  Afghanistan  national,
           is educated to GCSE level and in good  health.   He  speaks  the
           local language and has worked in  this  country  and  this  will
           assist him to reintegration into his home country".

   9.  Judge  Chana  was  therefore  not  satisfied  that  if  returned   to
      Afghanistan the Appellant would face a real risk of persecution, death
      or torture  or  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment  and
      dismissed his asylum, Humanitarian Protection and Human Rights claims.



  10. Permission to appeal against that decision has been granted  by  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Owens on the  28th  June  2019.  She  stated  that  the
      Respondent had accepted the core of the  Appellant's  claim  in  issue
      related to  the  reasonableness  of  relocation.   She  found  it  was
      arguable that the Judge had not given adequate reasons for  concluding
      the Appellant has family in Kabul in light of the evidence before  her
      from the Red Cross, the Appellant and  his  sister  and  that  it  was
      further arguable when assessing whether  it  was  reasonable  for  the
      Appellant to return to Kabul the Judge had failed  to  properly  apply
      the guidance in the country  guidance  case  of  AS  (Afghanistan)  CG
      [2018]  UKUT  00118  (IAC)  by  failing  to  take  into  account   the
      Appellant's age, the fact that he had been in the UK since he  was  15
      years old, the fact that his family had also left Afghanistan and that
      he is of a minority religion.  She said that she took account  of  the
      fact that AS (Afghanistan) had been remitted  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
      however the issues were still pertinent.  She  further  found  it  was
      arguable that the Judge had  failed  to  assess  whether  or  not  the
      Appellant  met  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  of   the
      Immigration Rules and stated that all grounds may be argued.

  11. I am grateful to Mr Melvin for having produced a Rule 24  Reply  dated
      the 31st July 2019 which I have fully taken into account.

  12. In considering this appeal, I have considered all  of  the  documents,
      including inter alia the reasons for refusal letter, the  decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana, the previous decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Mays,  the  Grounds  of  Appeal,  the  Rule  24  Reply,
      together with the oral submissions of both  legal  representatives  at
      the appeal hearing.  I have  also  considered  all  of  the  documents
      within the file.  Even if I do not mention  any  particular  piece  of
      evidence, submission, or document within this decision, that does  not
      mean that I have failed to consider the same, as I have considered all
      of the arguments and all of  the  documentation  before  reaching  any
      decision.

  13. Within the first ground of appeal it is  argued  that  the  Judge  has
      given insufficient findings in  respect  of  the  Appellant's  refugee
      claim, it was argued that the Respondent had accepted the  Appellant's
      claim to be credible and the core of his account had been accepted but
      that Judge Mays originally found that the Appellant  could  internally
      relocate on the basis that it was said that there was no  evidence  to
      show the Appellant had initiated contact with the Red Cross and he had
      a paternal uncle in Afghanistan.  It was argued that  the  Appellant's
      fear of integration based on being a Shia was not considered.   It  is
      argued that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made no findings in  respect
      of the Appellant's claim that  he  was  a  Shia  and  that  there  was
      evidence that the Appellant had in fact initiated contact with the Red
      Cross and confirmed his family could not be traced  and  letters  from
      the Red Cross appear in the Respondent's bundle.  It  is  argued  that
      the Judge found that the Appellant had an uncle,  without  considering
      the evidence of the Red Cross and she had made no findings in  respect
      of the Appellant's evidence and that of his sister in respect  of  the
      fact that the Appellant had no contact with his uncle.  It  is  argued
      that the Judge's finding that the Red Cross had said that  they  could
      not trace his family was contradictory to a finding  that  "that  does
      not mean that he does not have family there".  It is argued  that  the
      Judge's findings at paragraph 37 when relying upon the sister's  visit
      in 2012 to show there were family there failed to take account of  the
      fact that her visit was prior to the events that took place  that  led
      to the Appellant's family leaving Afghanistan as  the  sister's  visit
      was in 2012, whereas the killing took place in October 2013.

  14. In the second ground of appeal regarding the reasonableness of return,
      it is argued that although the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  found  that
      the Appellant was a fit male she had not considered the facts  present
      in the Appellant's circumstances as outlined at paragraph 230  of  the
      country guidance case of AS (Safety of Kabul)  Afghanistan  CG  [2018]
      UKUT 00118 IAC where it was stated:

           "our findings above show that it  is  not  generally  unsafe  or
           unreasonable for a single healthy man to internally relocate  to
           Kabul.  However, we emphasise that a case by case  consideration
           of whether internal relocation is reasonable  for  a  particular
           person is required by Article 8 of the  qualification  directive
           and domestic authorities including Januzi and AH (Sedan).   When
           doing so, we consider  that  there  are  a  number  of  specific
           factors which may be relevant to bear in mind.   These  include,
           individually as well as  cumulatively  (including  consideration
           that the strength of one factor may  counteract  and  balance  a
           weakness of another factor):

           (i)   age, including the age at which a person left Afghanistan;

           (ii)   nature  and  quality  of  connections  to  Kabul   and/or
           Afghanistan;

           (iii) physical and mental health;

           (iv)  language, education and vocational skills".

  15. It is said that the Judge inadequately assessed whether the  Appellant
      had family to return to and failed to consider factors such as he  was
      a minor when he left aged only 15 and that he would  not  be  familiar
      and only just turned 18 he would be  vulnerable  upon  return.  It  is
      argued that there is no bright line rule at  the  age  of  18  when  a
      person in the United Kingdom is considered to be  an  adult  and  that
      there are different views as to becoming an adult,  in  particular  to
      achieving manhood in Afghanistan society, which  is  not  specifically
      linked to age but marital status.  It is argued that the Appellant has
      acquired skills in the UK which are not relevant to jobs that would be
      offered to him in Afghanistan and he has no experience  of  living  in
      Kabul and has very poor prospects  of  finding  stable  work  and  the
      Judge's findings in regards employment are unsupported.  It is further
      argued that the Judge has failed to consider the facts that  returning
      as a Shia would put him at further risk.  It  is  further  argued  the
      Judge  has  not  considered  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  at  all   in   her
      determination and that there would be very significant obstacles given
      the fact he has no family to return to, his  claim  was  found  to  be
      credible, his origin as a Shia he has never lived in Kabul and has  no
      experience of living alone and being absent since he was a minor.

  16. It was further argued in respect of  Article  8  the  Judge  erred  in
      finding that the Appellant had no family life in the UK and the  Judge
      made no findings in respect of his family life with his sister in  the
      UK with whom he had lived since he was a minor and the Judge had  made
      no findings in respect of his private life and has not considered  the
      factors set out in Section 117 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002.

  17. Within the Rule 24 Reply it is argued that the Judge properly assessed
      the evidence in relation to the Appellant having a paternal  uncle  in
      Kabul, as well as having a father's business partner, who had a  house
      there and it was open to the Judge to make that finding  in  light  of
      the oral evidence at the hearing.  It is argued that the Appellant and
      his witness wished to distance themselves from any family contact with
      relatives in Afghanistan for obvious reasons and that  the  Judge  had
      dealt with the Red Cross letter at paragraph 37 of the  Judgment.   It
      is argued that the Judge however proceeded to take the appeal  at  its
      highest such that even if he did not have family  in  Afghanistan  the
      Appellant was able-bodied, country and language aware and a citizen of
      Afghanistan and would be able to reintegrate back there.  It is argued
      that the Judge did consider whether  it  was  reasonable  for  him  to
      relocate to Kabul and made findings that it was reasonable for him  to
      so relocate.  It is argued that 20% of the Afghan population are  Shia
      and without more, that is not a stand-alone ground of appeal which has
      any prospect of success and there is no country guidance to  say  that
      Shia Muslims are per se persecuted.  It is further argued that  having
      found the Appellant  can  reintegrate  at  paragraph  38  it  was  not
      incumbent on the Judge to reiterate this finding for  the  purpose  of
      paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.   It  is  argued  that  the
      Judge has considered the new claim and considered it through the  lens
      of the current country guidance and reached findings open to  her  and
      directed herself appropriately.

  18. In her oral submissions, Miss Heidar,  inter  alia,  argued  that  the
      question as to whether or not the  Appellant  had  family  members  to
      return to in Afghanistan was relevant to his  ability  to  reintegrate
      for the purposes of AS and that the Appellant and his sister had  said
      that they were no longer in contact with the uncle and that the sister
      had given specific evidence on that point, but the Judge had  made  no
      findings on that evidence.  She argued that the sister had been  asked
      detailed questions in cross-examination, and the Judge had  not  taken
      account of that evidence.  Miss Heidar further argued that  the  Judge
      clearly erred in her findings at paragraph 37 that the  Appellant  had
      family to go  back  to  based  upon  the  sister  having  returned  to
      Afghanistan in 2012, as that was  before  the  killing.   She  further
      argued that following the case of KA (Afghanistan), the  duty  on  the
      Home Office to make enquiries as to the location  of  the  Appellant's
      family did not end when he was aged 18.  She  argued  that  the  Judge
      erred for the purposes  of  the  case  of  AS  in  that  she  had  not
      considered that the Appellant left when he was still a minor,  had  no
      family there and never lived in Kabul and that he  was  a  Shia.   She
      agreed that that alone was not a sufficient ground on the basis of him
      being Shia but said it was not the only ground but was one factor  the
      Judge could have  taken  into  account  for  the  purposes  of  AS  in
      determining whether he can relocate to Kabul.

  19. She argued that the Judge had not made any findings in respect of  the
      Appellant's private life or paragraph 276ADE, or  in  respect  of  his
      family life.  She argued  that  the  definition  of  very  significant
      obstacles for the purposes of paragraph 276ADE was different from that
      applied in the asylum claim.  She argued that the Appellant had  lived
      with his sister in the UK since he had come here and there  were  more
      than emotional ties involved as argued in the Skeleton Argument.   She
      accepted that although the Appellant had a fianc�e that  was  not  the
      strongest part of his articled claims as they were not married.

  20. Mr Melvin relied upon his Rule 24 Reply.  He further argued that there
      was no material error in this case, and if the Judge  made  her  error
      regarding the visit  in  2012  of  the  sister,  that  error  was  not
      material.  He argued the Judge at paragraph 37 had taken the  case  at
      its highest and made findings that even if there was no  family  there
      the Appellant would be able to get employment  and  settle  down.   He
      reminded me that in paragraph 2 of the head note of AS  it  was  found
      that it was not generally unduly harsh for an able-bodied male  to  be
      able to return and live in  Kabul.   He  argued  that  Judge  May  had
      previously found that the Appellant was able to contact his  uncle  in
      Afghanistan  and  that  was  the  starting  point  for  the  case   of
      Devaseelan.  He argued that the Red Cross letter was just  in  respect
      of the Appellant's father and not in respect of the business  partner,
      the uncle or aunt and that the Judge was  entitled  to  make  findings
      that the Appellant did have family in Afghanistan. He argued that  the
      Supreme Court had now made clear that the Home Office did not  have  a
      duty to trace family members in the way suggested by Miss Heidar.

  21. Mr Melvin argued the Appellant was financially independent and working
      and there was no evidence of emotional dependency for the purposes  of
      establishing a family life based on the case of  Kugathas  and  argued
      that the Judge made findings in respect of Article 8 which  were  open
      to her and that the  findings  were  adequate.   He  argued  that  the
      Appellant is now a 20-year-old male who does have connections to Kabul
      and would be able to integrate and for the first 15 years of his  life
      he had spent his  life  in  Afghanistan  and  knows  the  culture  and
      language and was not at risk upon return.   He  argued  there  was  no
      country guidance or expert evidence to show that Shia Muslims  per  se
      were at risk  of  persecution  upon  return  and  15  to  20%  of  the
      population are Shia Muslims.

  22. He argued that the Judge needed to  assess  what  had  happened  since
      Judge May made her decision and she  had  properly  assessed  the  new
      evidence and found it reasonable for  him  to  return  to  Kabul.   He
      argued that the Appellant himself had not  attempted  to  contact  his
      father's business partner or aunt who were all living  in  Afghanistan
      and there was not a duty on the Respondent to try to trace  them.   He
      argued there was no material error.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

  23. Although Miss Heidar placed reliance on the case of  KA  (Afghanistan)
      [2012] EWCA Civ 1014 to argue that  the  Respondent's  duty  to  trace
      family members not stopping when the Appellant turned 18 and  was  not
      discharged by giving them leave until they reach the age  of  17�  and
      point them in the direction of the  Red  Cross  offices,  the  Supreme
      Court in the case of TN and MA (Afghanistan) v The Secretary of  State
      for the Home Department and AA (Afghanistan) v The Secretary of  State
      for the Home Department [2015] UKSC 40, made it clear that  an  asylum
      appeal should be determined by reference to the situation at the  time
      of the Appellant's decision rather than by reference to the  situation
      at the time of the original decision in respect of the  tracing  issue
      and that in deciding whether or not to accept the Appellant's  account
      the Tribunal must act on the evidence before it, with  no  presumption
      of credibility.  The Supreme Court  found  that  the  failure  by  the
      Respondent to properly discharge a tracing obligation did  not  affect
      that and the appeal should not have been allowed by the reason of  the
      Respondent's breaching the tracing obligation.  It was found that  the
      purposes of tracing a child's family is for the  child's  welfare  and
      promoting reunification not for the purposes  of  gathering  evidence,
      although that may be the result.  The question therefore as to whether
      the Respondent had failed to attempt to trace the Appellant's  family,
      would not have given rise to any presumption of credibility or been  a
      factor  counting  in  the  Appellant's  favour  for  the  purposes  of
      consideration of the asylum claim.  There was no material error on the
      part of the Judge in failing to refer to the question  of  tracing  by
      the Home Office.

  24. Although it was argued by the Appellant that he had made contact  with
      the British Red Cross who confirmed  that  his  family  could  not  be
      traced by the date of the decision, which had not been properly  taken
      into account by Judge Chana, the letters from the  British  Red  Cross
      contained within the Respondent's bundle,  dated  the  22nd  September
      2014 and the 2nd October 2015,  both  referred  to  tracing  enquiries
      regarding Ghulam Hussain Yaqubi, the Appellant's father,  rather  than
      his uncle.  There was then an appointment letter dated the 15th  April
      2016, and a further letter from the Red Cross  dated  the  25th  April
      2016, again relating to Ghulam Hussain Yaqubi, confirming that the Red
      Cross had been unable to obtain any information regarding the  present
      location of Mr Ghulam Hussain Yaqubi.  The letters from the Red  Cross
      do not relate to other family members and do not relate to  the  uncle
      that both First-tier Tribunal Judge  Mays  and  thereafter  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Chana found was living in  Kabul  in  Afghanistan,  his
      aunt who was found by Judge Mays to have been living north  of  Kabul,
      or in respect of the business partner of his father.   The  fact  that
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana did not refer to the letters from  the
      Red Cross would not in any way have affected her findings  in  respect
      of whether or not the Appellant still had family in Afghanistan, given
      that it was not being argued that his father was in  Afghanistan,  the
      argument related to whether or not his uncle and his father's business
      partner were still in Afghanistan and  whether  he  had  contact  with
      them. The Red Cross letters did  not  refer  to  them.  There  was  no
      material error in Judge Chana's failure to refer to that evidence.

  25. Further, although it does appear that Judge Chana did err at paragraph
      37 of her decision in  taking  account  that  the  Appellant's  sister
      returned to Afghanistan in 2012 for a holiday when finding that it was
      not credible that she would go to  Afghanistan  for  a  holiday  in  a
      country which the Appellant claims is dangerous if she and her husband
      did not family in that country to visit, as at that time it was before
      the shooting which was agreed had taken place, and before it  is  said
      that the Appellant and his parents  had  left  Afghanistan.   However,
      Judge Mays  had  found  that  the  Appellant  did  have  an  uncle  in
      Afghanistan, and that  was  a  starting  point  for  the  purposes  of
      Devaseelan.  There was no evidence before Judge Chana to say that that
      uncle had left, and it was therefore open  to  her  in  light  of  the
      previous findings to find that the Appellant did still have  an  uncle
      in Afghanistan who was living in Kabul. The error in  that  regard  is
      therefore not material.

  26. Further, it is clear that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  take
      account of the evidence of the Appellant's sister Miss Yaqubi and that
      she had not spoken to her uncle  or  aunt  since  2012,  as  this  was
      recorded in paragraph 25 of her Judgment.  The Judge also took account
      at paragraph 18 of his decision of the Appellant's  evidence  that  he
      said that he had last spoken to his uncle in 2011/12.  Judge Chana was
      entitled to take account of the fact that previously  Judge  Mays  did
      not find the Appellant's evidence credible that he would not  be  able
      to contact his uncle upon  return.   Despite  the  Appellant  and  his
      sister's evidence that they had not been in contact with the uncle and
      aunt, previously Judge Mays  had  found  that  the  father's  business
      partner could help trace the Appellant's uncle and that he also had an
      aunt residing in Mazar-e-Sharif.   Judge  Mays  also  found  that  the
      Appellant's sister or her husband could also help the Appellant locate
      his uncle and aunt.  As that was the factual basis for the decision in
      October 2015, although over three years had passed since the  date  of
      the decision by Judge Chana, it was still open to her to find, as  she
      did, that not only did the Appellant have an uncle in Kabul  but  that
      she did not find his evidence credible that he would not  be  able  to
      contact him upon return.  That was a finding open to her having  heard
      the evidence from the Appellant.  There is no material error of law in
      that regard.

  27. In respect of the argument that the Judge had misapplied  the  country
      guidance case of AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 00118
      (IAC) the point being made in the  case  was  that  it  will  not,  in
      general, be unreasonable or unduly harsh for a single  adult  male  in
      good health to relocate to  Kabul,  even  if  he  does  not  have  any
      specific  connections  or  support  network  in  Kabul.  However,  the
      particular individual circumstances of an Appellant must be taken into
      account in connection with the conditions of the place  of  relocation
      including the person's age, nature and  quality  of  support,  network
      connections with Kabul and  Afghanistan,  their  physical  and  mental
      health, their language, educational and vocational skills, in order to
      determine whether a person fell within the general position.

  28. Judge Chana made findings which were open to her  that  the  Appellant
      did have family members to return to in Afghanistan including an uncle
      in Kabul who could be traced by him  upon  return.   Judge  Chana  was
      clearly aware that the Appellant left Afghanistan when he was just 15,
      but noted that he was now an adult, and the Judge  noted  specifically
      that she accepted that he was a minor  when  he  left  Afghanistan  at
      paragraph 27 of the Judgment and the Judge did properly  consider  the
      factors set out in AS including the fact that he is an Afghan national
      and educated to GCSE level and in good health and he spoke  the  local
      language and had worked in the United Kingdom which  she  found  would
      help him reintegrate into the home country.  The  argument  that  that
      would not be useful in obtaining jobs in Afghanistan was  in  fact  an
      attempt to relitigate the argument run before the First-tier Tribunal,
      and does not  reveal  any  material  error  of  law.   The  Judge  has
      explained why the Appellant on her findings would be  able  to  settle
      down and find employment in light of the fact that he  had  family  in
      Kabul in the form of his uncle, his education and work history.

  29. In respect  of  the  argument  regarding  Article  8,  the  Judge  has
      explained why he did not consider the  Appellant's  relationship  with
      his sister, brother-in-law and niece not to be  family  life  for  the
      purposes of Article 8 and that prior to coming to the  United  Kingdom
      he had lived apart from her in Afghanistan.  This was therefore not  a
      sister who he had  lived  with  throughout  his  life,  and  in  those
      circumstances  it  was  open  to  the  judge  to  conclude  there  was
      insufficient evidence to justify the First-tier Tribunal Judge finding
      that there was sufficient dependency now the Appellant is an adult  to
      amount to family life in  the  Kugathas  sense.  The  Judge  has  made
      findings open to her that there was not family life for  the  purposes
      of Article 8 in that regard.

  30. The  Judge  has  also  considered  the  Appellant's  private  life  at
      paragraph 51 of the decision and although not specifically referencing
      Section 117B, had noticed that little weight  should  be  given  to  a
      private life established at a time when  the  immigration  status  was
      precarious.  He therefore has considered that  section,  although  not
      referring to the same specifically.  Having found that  the  Appellant
      did have family to return to in Afghanistan and that he would be  able
      to find employment there,  the  Judge  has  not  materially  erred  in
      failing  to  consider   specifically   paragraph   276ADE(vi)   as   a
      consideration of that paragraph would have led to the same outcome, in
      light of the Judge's findings in respect of his ability to  return  to
      Afghanistan and his ability  to  reintegrate  there  and  live  safely
      without undue hardship.  The failure to consider separately  paragraph
      276ADE(vi) is therefore not a material error of law in this case.

  31. In respect of the argument regarding the Appellant being a Shia Muslim
      not having been dealt with by the Judge, clearly, although  there  was
      reference to Shia Muslims being targeted within the refusal letter, as
      Miss Heidar concedes, that in itself was not going  to  be  sufficient
      for the Appellant to succeed in his asylum, Humanitarian Protection or
      Human Rights claim.  As Mr Melvin indicates between 15 and 20% of  the
      population are Shia Muslims, there is  no  country  guidance  case  to
      indicate that in fact Shia Muslims are at risk upon return.  The Judge
      having made perfectly adequate findings which  were  open  to  her  in
      respect of the other issues, the fact that she has not dealt with that
      issue therefore cannot amount to a material error of law.

  32. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana does  not  reveal  any
      material error of law and is maintained.
