                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge Shimmin on 23 February 2015 against the  decision
           and reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hanes promulgated on 11
           February 2015 dismissing the  Appellant's  asylum,  humanitarian
           protection and  human  rights  appeals.    It  should  be  noted
           immediately that the judge had no jurisdiction to deal with  any
           human rights claim the Appellant  had  because  the  appeal  was
           against the refusal to grant him asylum, under section 83 of the
           Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


      2.    The Appellant is a national  of  Afghanistan,  whose  (disputed)
           date of birth was stated as 1 January 1998.  He stated  that  he
           feared to return to Afghanistan because of his family's  enemies
           and current conditions there.


      3.    When granting permission to appeal,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
           Shimmin considered that it was arguable  that  Judge  Hanes  had
           failed to deal with the Appellant's welfare and the Secretary of
           State's failure to attempt to trace the Appellant's family.


      4.    The Respondent filed notice under rule 24 dated  18  March  2015
           indicating that the appeal  was  opposed.   Standard  directions
           were made  by  the  tribunal  and  the  appeal  was  listed  for
           adjudication of whether or not there was  a  material  error  of
           law.




      Submissions


      5.    Mr Alexander for the Appellant relied on the grounds of  onwards
           appeal earlier submitted, together with the grant of  permission
           to appeal.  It was a clear error of law for the  judge  to  have
           considered the Appellant's human rights and  that  part  of  the
           determination would have to be set aside. Counsel submitted that
           although the judge had  found  that  the  Appellant  was  not  a
           credible witness, the duty to trace was a separate matter and it
           affected the assessment of the risk on return.  The section  55,
           Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 duty had not  been
           discharged.  The vulnerability of the  Appellant  had  not  been
           taken into account.  The Secretary of State had not  traced  the
           Appellant's family.


      6.    Mr Tufan for the Respondent relied on the Respondent's  rule  24
           notice.  He agreed that there had been no jurisdiction  to  deal
           with any human rights claim but submitted that the decision  and
           reasons  otherwise  disclosed  no  error  of  law.   TN  and  MA
           Afghanistan [2015] UKSC 40 was the leading authority on tracing.
            The Appellant's evidence was so unreliable that  tracing  could
           not have been attempted.   Although the judge accepted that  the
           Appellant was Afghan, his home village had never been found on a
           map.   The  failure  to  trace  had  no  real  bearing  on   the
           Appellant's credibility.


      7.    The tribunal reserved its determination, having  indicated  that
           its finding in principle was that no material error of  law  had
           been shown.




      No material error of law


      8.    Clearly the judge fell  into  legal  error  by  considering  the
           Appellant's human rights and  making  findings,  as  he  had  no
           jurisdiction to do  so.   That  part  of  the  determination  is
           accordingly set aside.


      9.    The tribunal accepts Mr Tufan's submissions in relation  to  the
           grounds of onwards appeal advanced on  the  Appellant's  behalf.
           In the tribunal's view, the grant of permission  to  appeal  was
           overly generous.  The judge gave close attention to the issue of
           the Appellant's age and his vulnerability, which were taken into
           account in reaching his credibility  assessment.   Indeed,  that
           assessment was not the subject of any real challenge and in  the
           tribunal's judgment was thorough and eminently sustainable.


      10.   Given that the Appellant chose to give unreliable evidence,  the
           prospect of tracing his family was so slight that the judge  was
           right to disregard any formal breach of duty by the  Respondent.
           As Mr Tufan reminded the tribunal,  even  the  Appellant's  home
           village  had  not  been  positively  identified.   TN   and   MA
           Afghanistan (above) shows that  the  judge  had  to  assess  the
           appeal on the evidence he had.  There  was  nothing  from  which
           tracing could have commenced and so the failure to trace  or  to
           attempt to trace was irrelevant, as the judge correctly found at
           [25] of his decision.


      11.   This onwards appeal is, of course, entirely theoretical  in  any
           event, as the Appellant is  not  currently  subject  to  removal
           directions as he was granted discretionary  leave  until  he  is
           17ï¿½.  There was  no  error  of  law.   There  is  no  basis  for
           interfering with the judge's decision to dismiss the Appellant's
           "upgrade" appeal, which dismissal must stand.


      DECISION


      The tribunal finds there that was a  material  error  of  law  in  the
decision    and reasons so far as the judge  made  findings  concerning  the
Appellant's human rights.  That part of  the  decision  and  reasons  (i.e.,
[31]) is set  aside  and  should  be  treated  as  deleted.   Otherwise  the
decision and reasons stands unchanged.
