                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Levin promulgated on 28 October 2014 which dismissed the
    Appellant's appeal on all grounds.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on  11  November  1987  and  is  a  national  of
    Afghanistan.

 4. On 13 August 2013 the Appellant applied  for  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as the wife of the Sponsor Aziz Javadi under Appendix FM
    of the Rules.

 5. On 1 November 2013 the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter gave two reasons for refusal:

      a) The Appellant did not meet the eligibility requirements  for  entry
         clearance as a partner.

      b) The Appellant did not meet the financial requirements  because  the
         Appellant claimed that the sponsor was self employed  and  received
         an income of �19,297 in the last financial year but  the  Appellant
         had failed to produce three items of specified evidence in  support
         of the sponsor's earnings as specified in paragraph 7  of  Appendix
         FM-SE namely her sponsors Statement of Account (SA300 or SA302)  as
         required by paragraph 7(b)(ii), her sponsors bank statement for the
         same 12 month period as the tax returns where her sponsor holds  or
         held a separate business bank account as required by 7(e)  and  his
         personal bank statement for the same 12 month  period  as  the  tax
         returns showing that his income from self employment has been  paid
         into an account in his name as required by paragraph 7(f).   .

The Judge's Decision

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Levin ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against the Respondent's
    decision. The Judge set out at paragraph 15-18 set out the relevant law
    identifying at paragraph 18 those documents that it  was  asserted  the
    Appellant had failed to produce. He found:

      a) The marriage of the parties was genuine and subsisting.

      b) The Appellant had to establish by the required  evidence  that  her
         sponsor earned �18600 in the relevant financial year  which  was  6
         April 2012 to 5 April 2013.

      c) The business accounts were prepared by Accounts and Taxation Centre
         and paragraph 7(h)(ii)(bb) required that they were members of a  UK
         Recognised  Supervisory  Body  and   produce   a   certificate   of
         confirmation to that effect and the case had been adjourned for all
         parties to submit evidence as to whether the  Sponsors  accountants
         met this requirement at the time the accounts were  prepared  as  a
         members of the Institute of Financial Accountants.

      d) Ms Faryl relied on a document  at  pages  6-7  of  the  Appellant's
         bundle which was stated to be  an  extract  from  the  Home  Office
         guidelines confirming members of registered bodies.  Ms  Faryl  was
         unable to produce the complete document.

      e) He did not accept that the pages referred to in (d) above were from
         the Home Office guidance.

      f) Moreover he found that even if he accepted it  was  extracted  from
         such guidance there was a requirement for those  who  prepared  the
         accounts to be either a fully qualified chartered accountant  or  a
         certified accountant who is a member of a registered  body  and  at
         the date the accounts were prepared  in  April  2013  the  sponsors
         accountants did not meet this requirement.

      g) He considered Ms Faryl's submission that Mr Zafar of  Accounts  and
         Taxation Centre had from  30  May  2014  been  a  member  of  a  UK
         Supervisory Body by virtue of section D(b) (i) (dd) of Appendix  FM
         and therefore met the requirements of the Rules. He  did  not  find
         that Mr Zafar's situation came within section D as at the  time  of
         preparing the business accounts Mr Zafar was  not  a  member  of  a
         United Kingdom Supervisory Body and therefore the accounts had  not
         been prepared by someone who was a member of such a  body  and  the
         Appellant had not therefore produced a specified document.

      h) While Mr Zafar became a member of ACCA 12 months after the accounts
         in this case were prepared there  was  no  certificate  before  the
         Judge as required by paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE to show that  he
         had either personally prepared the accounts or signed them  off  as
         being a true reflection of the Appellant's income.

 7. Grounds of appeal were lodged which argued that the Judge had failed to
    acknowledge that the requirement for bank statements  from  a  business
    account or personal bank  statements  were  alternatives  or  make  any
    findings  in  relation  to  that  ground;  that  in  focusing  on   the
    requirement for the accounts to be prepared by an accountant who was  a
    member of a UK Recognised Supervisory Body the Judge was taking a point
    not taken by the ECO or ECM and the Appellant was entitled to  consider
    that requirement was waived; in the  alternative  that  defect  in  the
    application was cured after the matter was raised for the first time by
    the Home Office Presenting Officer on 14 August 2014.

 8.  On  12  January  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Scott  Baker  gave
    permission to appeal.

 9. I heard submissions from Ms Faryl at  the  hearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that (a) She relied on the grounds of appeal.

      a) The income itself was not disputed simply whether the Appellant had
         produced the specified documents.

      b) I also took into account additional written  submissions  dated  26
         March from MA Consultants which were invited in a letter  dated  13
         March 2015 by the Tribunal.

10. On behalf of the Respondent Ms Johnstone submitted that she  relied  on
    her Rule 24 response.

Finding on Material Error

11. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

12. This was an out of country application for entry clearance as a  spouse
    where the sponsor Mr Javadi was self employed as a builder and  had  to
    establish by mandatory evidence as required by Appendix FM-SE  that  he
    earned �18,600. In this case it was accepted that the year in issue was
    6 April 2012 to 5 April 2013. The appeal against the  refusal  decision
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin and the hearing took  place
    over three separate dates.

13. It is argued that in dismissing the appeal because  the  Appellant  had
    produced unaudited accounts that were not prepared by an accountant who
    was a member of  a  UK  Recognised  Supervisory  Body  as  required  by
    paragraph 7(h)(i)(bb) the Judge had raised an issue not raised  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer or the ECM.I am satisfied that the  failure  of
    the  Respondent  in  the  refusal  letter  to  identify  one   of   the
    requirements of the Rules that the Appellant had  not  met  was  not  a
    waiver or a concession as  there  has  been  no  positive  act  by  the
    Respondent it was simply a failure that did not bind the  Judge.  In  A
    (Somalia)  [2004]  UKIAT  00065,  during  the  course  of  the  closing
    submissions  made  on  the  appellant's  behalf  by  her  counsel,  the
    adjudicator  stated,  for  the  first  time,  that  he  considered  the
    appellant's nationality to be in issue. The fact  that  the  respondent
    had not raised the point, either during the course of  the  hearing  or
    previously, was no reason why the adjudicator himself should not do so.
      The onus to (apply for an adjournment or recall the appellant) was on
    the appellant's counsel not on the Adjudicator.

14. I am satisfied that there was no procedural unfairness  in  the  Judges
    conduct of the case. Following the initial hearing of the  case  on  14
    August 2014 the Judge having identified that there  was  a  requirement
    for the Accounts in issue to be provided by an  accountant  who  was  a
    member of a UK Recognised Supervisory Body he issued Directions to  the
    parties on 20 August 2014 allowing them the opportunity to address this
    issue and relisted the matter for an oral hearing on 8  September  2014
    and again on 8 October 2014 where Ms Faryl made submissions in relation
    to this issue.

15. The alternative argument advanced in the  grounds  is  that  while  the
    Appellant's accountants may not have been members of the required  body
    at the time the accounts were prepared a letter was produced from a  Mr
    Zafar on the notepaper of RMI  Accountancy  (previously  known  as  the
    Accounts and Taxation Centre) confirming that  he  was  admitted  as  a
    member of the ACCA on 31 May 2014. Ms Faryl argued that  section  D  of
    Appendix FM-SE applied and the Appellant  had  therefore  produced  the
    required specified document albeit it was produced after  the  date  of
    application. The Judge set out at  paragraph  38  the  requirements  of
    section D in relation to circumstances  in  which  the  decision  maker
    might  contact  the  Appellant  or  his  representatives  and  consider
    documents submitted after the application. He considered  her  argument
    advanced that  subsection  (dd)  applied  in  that  the  Appellant  had
    supplied a' document which  does  not  contain  all  of  the  specified
    information.' He found at paragraph 39 that the this  proviso  did  not
    apply as the defect could not have been cured  by  the  decision  maker
    contacting the Appellant or his representative at the time the decision
    was made because Mr Zafar was not a member of the Supervising  body  at
    that time. I accept that had the  post  decision  evidence  shown  that
    those who prepared the accounts were at  the  time  they  prepared  the
    accounts members of the United Kingdom supervisory body the Judge would
    have been able to take such evidence into account but that was not  the
    case. I am satisfied that the Judges findings were open to him  on  the
    evidence before him and that the appeal was bound to fail  because  the
    Appellant had not produced the specified evidence as required.

16. The first ground argues that the Judge made no findings in  respect  of
    the challenge raised in the refusal letter that the Appellant  had  not
    produced either business bank account statements for the same 12  month
    period as the tax return or in the alternative personal bank statements
    for the same 12 month period showing the income  from  self  employment
    being paid into the account. It was also  argued  that  the  Judge  had
    failed to identify that these requirements were alternatives.

17. I am satisfied that having identified at paragraph 5 that this  was  an
    issue raised in the refusal letter the Judge failed to make findings on
    this issue. However given my  finding  above  that  the  Appellant  had
    failed to provide the accounts produced by  an  accountant  who  was  a
    member of a UK Recognised Supervisory Body such  a  failure  would  not
    have been material as the appeal was bound to fail.

18.  I was therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read  as
    a whole  set  out  findings  that  were  sustainable  and  sufficiently
    detailed and based on cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

19. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

20. The appeal is dismissed.
