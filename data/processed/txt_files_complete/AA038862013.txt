                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

[1]  At the conclusion of the hearing conducted  on  21st  October  2013  we
    announced our decision, which was to dismiss  the  Appellant's  appeal.
    This is our reserved, reasoned judgment.

[2]  The Appellant is a national of Zimbabwe, born on  16th  May  1972.   In
    brief compass, the procedural history is as follows:

    (a)  On 23rd March 2003,  the  Respondent  ("the  Secretary  of  State)
        refused the Appellant's claim for asylum.

    (b)  On 3rd September 2003, the Adjudicator dismissed his appeal.

    (c)  In  October  2010,  still  present  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
        Appellant submitted a fresh claim for asylum.

    (d)  This further claim was not determined by the  Secretary  of  State
        until some three years later, when a decision dated 11th April 2013
        rejecting the Appellant's fresh claim for  asylum,  his  claim  for
        international protection, his claim under the Immigration Rules and
        his claim under the ECHR was made.

    (e)  The Appellant appealed.  By its determination promulgated  on  4th
        June 2013, the First-Tier Tribunal allowed the appeal under Article
        8 ECHR, dismissing it on the  asylum  and  humanitarian  protection
        grounds.

    (f)  The Secretary of State was granted permission  to  appeal,  giving
        rise to a decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson setting aside the
        first instance determination and giving directions for the  resumed
        hearing which we proceeded to conduct on 21st October 2013.



[3]  Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson found and decided as follows:

       i) There had been a failure at first instance  to  properly  conduct
          the Article 8 ECHR exercise.  In particular, the judgment  lacked
          the necessary analysis and reasons.


      ii) The Judge's treatment  of  the  introductory  tenancy  issue  was
          unsatisfactory, being unsupported  by  appropriate  findings  and
          reasons.

     iii)  The  public  interest  was  not  adequately  considered  in  the
          balancing exercise.


    As a result, errors of law were found and the decision  of  the  First-
    Tier Tribunal was set aside.

THE RESUMED HEARING

[4]  The evidence considered by this Tribunal consisted of, in summary:

     a) All of the evidence generated in connection with the first instance
        hearing.


     b) An Appellant's  appeal  hearing  bundle  containing  sundry  items,
        including two witness statements and an introductory tenancy.

     c) A further Appellant's bundle, the contents whereof included certain
        photographs, witness statements of the Appellant and his spouse and
        some college and local council materials.

[5]  We have also considered the Determination of the AIT of the  appeal  of
    the Appellant's spouse against the Secretary of  State's  rejection  of
    her asylum and human rights claims and associated decision  to  remover
    her, as an illegal entrant, to Zimbabwe heard by Judge Gladstone.   The
    Determination records that the  evidence  considered  by  the  Tribunal
    included  a  witness  statement  of  this  Appellant.    The   evidence
    summarised in paragraphs 18 et seq, in particular paragraphs 24/25,  is
    indicative of markedly little contact - and no  active  family  life  -
    between the Appellant and his spouse during a period of at least  seven
    years from 2002 to 2009.  This heavily restricted contact  was  also  a
    feature of the Appellant's witness statement, summarised in  paragraphs
    43/44 of the Determination.

[6]  In his witness statement, the Appellant claimed that he and his  spouse
    had been in a relationship  since  1996;  that  they  had  undergone  a
    traditional - but not formal -  marriage  on  an  unspecified  date  in
    January 2002; and that he proceeded to leave Zimbabwe -  a  country  to
    which he has not subsequently returned - evidently within days of  this
    alleged ceremony: see paragraph 2 of his most recent witness statement.
     Notably, his first witness statement omits  this  significant  detail.
    Nor does his first  witness  statement  attempt  to  date  the  alleged
    marriage ceremony.  Furthermore, there is  no  mention  of  it  in  his
    spouse's witness statement, which begins the "story" in 2013.  We  note
    further that in Judge  Gladstone's  detailed  r�sum�  of  the  spouse's
    evidence, in paragraphs 18 - 29 and 33 - 42 of his  Determination,  the
    spouse does not appear to have  mentioned  the  January  2002  marriage
    ceremony (albeit she asserted the same in  her  asylum  interview)  and
    neither her evidence nor the Appellant's evidence addressed at all what
    may fairly be described as the elephant in the room,  namely  why  they
    were content to live apart during the subsequent period of seven years.
     We have considered whether an intelligible and acceptable  explanation
    for this can be inferred from  all  the  evidence.  We  find  ourselves
    unable to make any such  inference.   Having  considered  the  evidence
    critically and realistically, we make the following initial findings:
     a) The Appellant and his "spouse" did not live as  unmarried  partners
        in Zimbabwe between 1996 and 2002.


     b) They did not undergo  a  traditional  marriage/wedding  in  January
        2002.

     c) They had no relationship of any kind between 2002 and 2009.

     d) Following the "spouse's" arrival in the United Kingdom  in  January
        2009, the relationship between these two adults had as one  of  its
        main aims the fortification of their  attempts  to  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom.

[7]  At this juncture, we add to the above findings the following:

      a) There are two children of the union considered  above.   They  were
         born on 19th October 2009  and  15th  February  2012  respectively.
         Thus the children are now aged 4 and 1 � years.


      b) The Appellant and his "spouse" are the parents of these children.

      c) The Appellant's immigration status is that of illegal immigrant.

      d) The "spouse" and the two children have been  granted  discretionary
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom, dating from 21st  June  2013
         and expiring on 21st June 2015.

      e) The family constituted by the Appellant, his "spouse", and the  two
         aforementioned children, which has  developed  incrementally  since
         January 2009, first lived together in the United  Kingdom  on  26th
         September 2013 viz just one month ago. Any prior  shared  residence
         was at most of a sporadic nature.

      f) The Appellant attempted to advance an innocent explanation for  the
         finding rehearsed immediately above, namely his  status  of  failed
         asylum seeker. We reject this.   We  find,  specifically,  that  it
         would have been  possible  for  the  entire  family  unit  to  live
         together under the introductory tenancy  which  commenced  on  29th
         October 2012  had  they  wished  to  do  so:  there  was  no  legal
         prohibition.  The Appellant, within the terms of clause 9.5 of  the
         agreement, would either have been considered  "part  of  your  [the
         tenant's] household" or the council's written approval  could  have
         been obtained.


      g) We accept that during the past year approximately the Appellant and
         the other three family members have had  some  contact  with  their
         local church, stimulated by their attendances at its services.   We
         find this to have been routine  contact  and  interaction,  nothing
         extraordinary.

[8]  It is common case that each of the four persons under scrutiny  has  no
    British nationality and  no  EU  citizenship.  Further,  all  four  are
    Zimbabwean nationals.

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSIONS

[9]  The asylum and international protection claims of  both  the  Appellant
    and his "spouse" having been  dismissed  by  due  process  of  law,  we
    proceed on the basis that neither will  be  at  risk  of  any  form  of
    proscribed treatment upon return to Zimbabwe.  The submission  advanced
    to this Tribunal by the Appellant's legal representative was that there
    is a "reasonable assumption" that if the Appellant is obliged to return
    to Zimbabwe, he will do  so  alone,  with  his  "spouse"  and  children
    remaining in the United Kingdom.  Thus it is argued, applying the first
    and second of the Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27  tests,  that  the  impugned
    decision will interfere with the family life in question.

[10] We reject this submission.   Our  primary  conclusion  is  that  having
    regard to the duration of the mother/father relationship (less  than  5
    years), the dismissal of  their  asylum  and  international  protection
    claims, the tender ages of the two children, the limited nature of  the
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom granted to mother  and  children,
    the obvious need and desire for the Appellant to  continue  to  perform
    fatherly duties  and  the  long  established  and  successful  business
    operated previously by the "spouse" in Zimbabwe, the strong probability
    is that this family will not voluntarily  fragment  but  will,  rather,
    remain together, returning to Zimbabwe in unison.  We consider this  to
    be, by some measure,  the  most  likely  scenario.  Thus  the  impugned
    decision will not interfere with their family life.

[11] If we are wrong in our primary conclusion, there is no dispute  between
    the parties about the requirements of legitimate aim or  in  accordance
    with  the  law,  thereby   leading   quickly   to   the   question   of
    proportionality. Into this equation enter the various factors rehearsed
    above, together with the  public  interest  in  play,  namely  that  of
    maintaining firm immigration control and discouraging false asylum  and
    international protection  claims.   Given  our  findings  above  it  is
    clearly reasonable to expect the Appellant and the other three  members
    of the family unit, to continue their extant family life  in  Zimbabwe,
    consequent upon his removal there. We consider that there  is  no  real
    obstacle, insurmountable or otherwise, to this. It has not  been  shown
    to be unreasonable in all the circumstances for the family to return as
    a whole to Zimbabwe where the family life they enjoy can continue.  The
    argument advanced by the Appellant's legal representative was that  the
    decision to remove him to Zimbabwe is perverse.  We conclude  that  the
    elevated threshold of perversity has manifestly not been  overcome  and
    is confounded by our findings rehearsed above.


[12] We further consider that, having regard to the  ages  of  the  children
    concerned, there will be no  interference  with  their  private  lives.
    There was no evidence that  the  children  have  formed  any  unusually
    strong or special friendships or other ties outside their  family  unit
    and we find no basis for inferring this.  In considering this  discrete
    issue, we take into account the decision  in  EA  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT
    00315 (IAC).  If, contrary to this finding, the impugned decision  does
    interfere with the private lives of either child, we are satisfied that
    it is proportionate, having regard to  their  limited  links  with  the
    United Kingdom, the tenuous nature of their  immigration  status  here,
    their young ages, their nationality and that of their parents  and  the
    public  interests  in  play.   We  refer  also  to  the  other  factors
    highlighted in paragraphs [10] and [11] above.  As the ECTHR  noted  in
    AA - v - United Kingdom [Application no 8000/08],  the  factors  to  be
    considered when evaluating proportionality in this  kind  of  case  are
    essentially the same in respect of both family life and  private  life.
    We are further satisfied, bearing in mind the decision in EB (Kosovo) -
    v - Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 41, that the
    regrettable delay of almost 3  years  in  determining  the  Appellant's
    asylum claim - noted above - does not tip the balance in favour of  any
    of the family members concerned.

[13] In reaching the above  conclusions  we  have  considered  our  duty  to
    identify the best interests of the two children of the  family  and  to
    accord them the primacy of importance required by  section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009.   The  duty  on  the
    Tribunal is to review the question of whether the Secretary of  State's
    functions have been discharged -

         ".....   having regard to the need to  safeguard  and  promote  the
         welfare of [the] the children ...."


    In considering this issue we are mindful of the guidance provided by
    the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4, which requires that a
    primacy of importance be accorded to the best interests of any child
    affected by decisions such as that under scrutiny in the present
    appeal.  We are also mindful of the decision of this Tribunal in EA
    Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00315 (IAC), which held that the correct starting
    point is that it is in the best interests of a child to live with and
    be brought up by his or her parents, subject to any very strong
    contraindicating factors.   We are satisfied that the Secretary of
    State has acquitted her duty under section 55 in the present case.   We
    consider that, as in many cases, the best interests of the children
    will be promoted by the maintenance of the extant family unit intact.
    Having regard to all of our material findings and evaluative
    predictions rehearsed above, our firm expectation, based on an
    assessment of strong probability, is that this family unit will remain
    together.  Furthermore, it is not unreasonable to expect these very
    young Zimbabwean nationals to be reared in the country of their
    nationality and that of their parents.  In the alternative if, contrary
    to our findings and assessments, the mother and children were to remain
    in the United Kingdom, securing still further facilities to do so, the
    most likely explanation for this would be that the father has not been
    an integral, active and responsible fatherly member of the family unit.
     On this alternative scenario, there will be no prejudice to the best
    interests of the children concerned.


[14] Finally, while this appeal was presented and  argued  with  an  almost
    exclusive focus on the family life dimension  of  Article  8  ECHR,  we
    address our minds also to the private lives of the two parents.   While
    the evidence  bearing  on  this  issue  was  somewhat  meagre,  it  was
    sufficient to establish that the impugned  decision  will  entail  some
    interference with the parents' established private lives in the  United
    Kingdom, particularly in the context of the community where they reside
    and their church congregation.   This  interference  pursues  the  same
    legitimate aims which we have already identified and we  consider  that
    it will be proportionate for the same reasons as articulated  above  in
    respect of the family life of all concerned.
DECISION

[15] We remake the decision by allowing the Secretary of State's appeal.
The appeal of the      Appellant is therefore dismissed.


ANONYMITY


[16]     The First-tier Tribunal made no order under Rule  45(4)(i)  of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.  We are mindful
    of our power under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008).  We take into account that there was no application for an
    order under this provision.  Having taken care to ensure that there  is
    no identification of the mother or either child in  this  judgment,  we
    decline to make any order for anonymity.  We shall,  however,  consider
    any application for such an order duly made in writing within  14  days
    of the promulgation hereof.
