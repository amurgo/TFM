For the respondent: Mr Tan, Senior Presenting Officer.

Introduction

        1. Both representatives are in agreement that the decision of First-
           tier Tribunal Judge LSL Mensah errs in law and invite me to set
           that decision aside and remake it, allowing the appeal.


        2. The appellant is a national of India who unsuccessfully appealed
           the respondent's refusal of entry clearance. She had applied on
           9 February 2017 to join her husband and sponsor, Mr Patel
           further to the provisions in appendix FM.The respondent accepted
           that the marriage was genuine and subsisting. However, the
           respondent did not accept that the financial requirements were
           met. Reference was made to her sponsor having 2 jobs, one with
           Brookfield Retail Limited as a cashier and another one with Top
           West Ltd as a delivery driver. In the application it was stated
           his combined salary was ï¿½21,621.82 which exceeded the financial
           requirements.

        3. It was accepted that all the specified evidence had been
           provided in relation to her sponsor's employment. However, the
           respondent decided to carry out checks and were unable to
           contact by telephone the manager of Top West Ltd or her sponsor
           on 3 occasions. Consequently, the respondent was not satisfied
           he was employed as claimed.

        4. The decision was reviewed by the entry clearance manager but was
           not changed. Reference was made to a letter submitted with the
           appeal to the effect that the sponsor ceased working with Top
           West limited on 31 March 2017. The entry clearance manager
           pointed out that the decision was on 21 October 2017 and
           therefore at that stage the sponsor was no longer earning
           sufficient monies.


        5. The appeal was heard by first-tier Tribunal Judge LS Mensah at
           Bradford on 11 October 2018. The decision dismissing the appeal
           was promulgated on 21 November 2018. The judge correctly points
           out at paragraph 3 that the decision is limited to consideration
           of article 8 rights albeit through the prism initially of the
           immigration rules.

        6. In submissions the presenting officer in the First-tier
           contended that the sponsor's employment was disputed and in any
           event the financial threshold could not be met at the date of
           the appeal hearing. The appellant's representative referred to
           HMRC records. At paragraph 6 however it is recorded that Counsel
           conceded that the minimum income threshold was not met at the
           time. However it was argued that his current employment meant
           the minimum threshold was met at the time of the appeal.

        7. At paragraph 8 the judge refers to the concession that the
           financial threshold was not met at the time. The judge therefore
           concluded the decision to refuse under appendix FM was correct.
           But for this the judge would have allowed the appeal on the
           basis the enquiries as to the  sponsor's employment were
           inadequate and that all the specified evidence had been
           supplied.

        8. The 1st point taken on appeal to the Upper Tribunal is that
           Counsel was mistaken in conceding that the financial
           requirements were not met at the time. The judge cannot be
           faulted for relying upon such a concession but both parties
           having considered the evidence agree this was an error. The
           evidence indicates the threshold was met.

        9. The judge went on to consider matters as at the date of hearing
           and at paragraph 11 accepted the sponsor had demonstrated his
           earnings met the minimum financial threshold. However, the judge
           took the view a fresh application should be made.

       10. Again, both parties before me were in agreement that as the
           financial requirements were met as at the date of hearing and
           there were no other reasons to the contrary then a refusal would
           be disproportionate.

       11. Given the acceptance by both sides that Counsel erred in
           conceding the threshold was not met at the time and it light of
           the judge's finding that the threshold was met at the date of
           hearing I find the material error of law established. There
           being no outstanding dispute I remake the decision allowing the
           appeal on article 8 grounds.
Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge LSL Mensah materially errs in law
and is set aside. The decision is remade and the appeal is allowed under
article 8.
