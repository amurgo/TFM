                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the re-making  of  the  decision  in  this  case  following  my
    previous conclusion that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  when
    dismissing the appellant's appeal against  the  refusal  of  his  human
    rights claim. My written decision and writing on that issue is appended
    to the present decision.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal, born in 1985. He is the son of  an
    ex-Gurkha soldier who served in the British Army  for  many  years  and
    died in 1996.  The  appellant's  mother  ("the  sponsor")  applied  for
    settlement in the United Kingdom at the same time  as  the  appellant's
    application (deemed to constitute a human rights claim) was made in May
    2018. Whilst the appellant's claim was refused, the sponsor was  issued
    with entry clearance and she arrived here in September  2018,  although
    it is accepted that she then returned to Nepal to be with the appellant
    before coming back to the United Kingdom in July 2019.



The issues

 3. Both representatives agreed that the core question to be determined was
    whether there was extant family life  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor, having regard to the well-known case-law on this issue.

 4. Mr Tufan conceded that if I were to find that family life did  in  fact
    exist, then, in light  of  the  well-established  "historic  injustice"
    consideration  applicable  in  Gurkha  cases,  the   refusal   of   the
    appellant's human rights claim would be disproportionate and  that  the
    appeal should be allowed on that basis.



The evidence

 5. I have considered the contents of  two  bundles  filed  and  served  on
    behalf of the appellant: the first (now  marked  AB1  and  having  been
    provided for the First-tier Tribunal hearing) is indexed and  paginated
    1-100; the second (now marked AB2) is indexed and paginated 1-13.

 6. No oral evidence was called. The appellant continues to reside in Nepal
    and there was no application to have him give evidence from  there.  As
    confirmed by the appellant's  representatives  at  the  telephone  case
    management hearing on 28 September 2020, the sponsor is living with the
    appellant in Nepal and again there was  no  request  for  her  to  give
    evidence from that country. It appears as though she went back there at
    some point after July 2019 and before March 2020.

 7. AB1 and AB2 contain, amongst other items, witness  statements  for  the
    appellant and the sponsor, together with documentary financial  support
    provided by the latter to the former.



Submissions

 8. Mr Khalid submitted that the evidence  as  a  whole  was  reliable.  It
    showed that the appellant had lived with the sponsor before the  latter
    came to the United Kingdom in 2019 for settlement.  The  appellant  had
    always been, and continues to be, financially dependent on the sponsor.
    His efforts to obtain work in Nepal had been unsuccessful.  Documentary
    evidence proved that he was able to access the sponsor's  bank  account
    and he used these funds to support himself. His three surviving sisters
    are married and living independent lives elsewhere  in  Nepal.  It  was
    also submitted that in addition to financial dependency, the  appellant
    had provided emotional and practical support  for  his  mother  who  is
    relatively elderly and in poor health. The need for  this  support  was
    said to be the primary reason why the sponsor left United  Kingdom  and
    returned to  Nepal.  In  light  of  the  relevant  case-law  (including
    Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31), there was family  life.  This  being  the
    case, Mr Khalid relied on the "historic injustice"  factor,  submitting
    that the appellant to succeed on Article 8 grounds.

 9. Mr Tufan acknowledged the evidence, but did not accept that  there  was
    family life in this case. Relying  on  AAO  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  840,  he
    submitted that financial dependency by an adult child on a  parent  was
    insufficient to show the  existence  of  family  life.  He  raised  the
    question of  whether  there  was  enough  evidence  to  show  that  the
    appellant had lived in a single family household before his mother came
    to the United Kingdom for the first time.

10. In reply, Mr Khalid referred to Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320  and  submitted
    that there was "real" and support by  the  sponsor  to  the  appellant.
    There was in this case both financial dependency and genuine  emotional
    support. It was confirmed that the sponsor  had  always  resided  alone
    whilst in the United Kingdom.



Findings of fact

11. I have of course considered all of the evidence before me, applying the
    balance of probabilities. I have assessed the evidence as at  the  date
    of hearing, but have had regard to the overall background to the case.

12. I accept that both the appellant and the sponsor have provided truthful
    evidence as to their circumstances over the course of time and to date.
    It is of course right that neither of them has given oral evidence  and
    have not in that sense been "tested". However, Mr Tufan  did  not  take
    any specific credibility points against them; their evidence has in  my
    view been consistent and entirely plausible; what they have said is  to
    an extent is supported by independent documentary evidence;  and  there
    are no sound reasons why I should find them to have been lying.

13. I find that the appellant had always lived with the  sponsor  in  Nepal
    and only found himself residing alone after the  latter  left  for  the
    United Kingdom in 2018. I accept that prior to this event the appellant
    had always been financially dependent on, first his  father,  and  then
    the sponsor, who herself had to rely on her late husband's war pension.
    I accept the documentary evidence which shows that  the  family's  home
    was destroyed by the earthquake in 2015 and that the appellant and  the
    sponsor had to live in government-provided shelter thereafter.  I  find
    that this provision continues to date.

14. I find that the sponsor, once in the United Kingdom, resided alone  and
    very soon found the separation from the appellant to be unbearable,  as
    she recounts in her  witness  statement.  It  is  clear  that  she  has
    suffered from a variety of  ailments,  and  sought  the  emotional  and
    practical assistance of the appellant prior  to  her  arrival  in  this
    country. I accept that the separation was too much for her and that she
    went back to Nepal shortly after her arrival here. I find that she then
    returned to the United Kingdom in 2019. Whilst I do not  have  evidence
    as to precisely when she then returned once more  to  Nepal,  I  accept
    that this occurred sometime prior to March  2020  essentially  for  the
    same reason as she went back on the first occasion, namely  her  desire
    to live with the appellant and to have support from him again.

15. In light of the evidence as a whole, I conclude that  there  has  been,
    and still is, a strong bond of  emotional  dependency  as  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor. This dependency  emanates  mainly  from  the
    sponsor to her son, but that is immaterial.

16. In addition, I am satisfied that the appellant has been, and still  is,
    financially dependent on the sponsor. That  is  the  reliable  evidence
    given by them both and it is supported by the letters from the  Sunrise
    Bank contained in both bundles to the effect  that  the  appellant  has
    authorised access to the sponsor's account in order to support himself.

17. Whilst there is no specific documentary evidence as to the  appellant's
    search for employment in Nepal, I  accept  his  own  evidence  to  this
    effect. In any event, the question of real and effective support is not
    necessarily concerned with whether  an  adult  child  could  work,  but
    whether there is in fact such support in existence which, alone  or  in
    combination with other factors, goes to show family life.

18. I also  accept  the  sponsor's  evidence  that  but  for  the  historic
    injustice perpetrated against former Gurkha soldiers,  the  appellant's
    father would have sought to have settled in  the  United  Kingdom  many
    years ago and that it is more likely than not that the appellant  would
    have been born in this country and now be a British citizen.



Analysis and conclusions

19. In light of my findings of fact above, I conclude that there is  extant
    family life between the appellant and the sponsor.  There  is  in  this
    case a combination of financial dependency and a strong emotional  bond
    between the protagonists. Article 8(1) is therefore engaged.

20. There is no issue as to the questions  of  interference,  the  decision
    being in accordance with the law, or whether it  pursues  a  legitimate
    aim.

21. As stated earlier, Mr Tufan conceded that if family life did exist, the
    refusal  of  the  appellant  human  rights  claim  would  constitute  a
    disproportionate interference with that life. That concession was in my
    judgment properly made.

22. The significance of the "historic injustice" factor has been recognised
    in the case-law for a considerable period of time now (see for  example
    Gurung [2013] EWCA  Civ  8  and  Ghising  and  others  (Gurkhas/BOCs  -
    historic wrong  -  weight)  [2013]  UKUT  567  (IAC)).  The  continuing
    significance  of  what  can  properly  be  described  as  a   "historic
    injustice" was emphasised most recently in Patel  (historic  injustice;
    NIAA 2002 Part 5A) [2020] UKUT 351 (IAC).

23. I take full account of the relevant considerations under  section  117B
    NIAA 2002. It is not clear whether the appellant can speak English to a
    reasonable degree, or that if he were in the United Kingdom he would be
    financially independent (although there  is  no  particular  reason  to
    think that he would not wish to find employment as soon  as  possible).
    For the avoidance of doubt, I would assume that these two factors count
    against  him.  However,  the  weight  attributable  to  the   "historic
    injustice" factor remains  very  significant.  It  has  the  effect  of
    greatly reducing the weight attributable to the public interest.

24. Ultimately, and in line with Mr Tufan's concession, I conclude that the
    refusal of the appellant's human rights claim was disproportionate  and
    therefore unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.



Anonymity

25. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction  and  there
    is no reason for me to do so. I make no such direction.



Notice of Decision

26. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law and I have set it aside.

27. I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Khalid, Solicitor from Goulds Green Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Andonian ("the judge"), promulgated on 14  August  2019,
    in  which  he  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision of 10 August 2018 refusing entry clearance
    as  the  adult  dependent  relative  of  the  Appellant's  mother  (the
    Sponsor).  The Sponsor was the widow of a former Ghurkha soldier.   The
    Appellant had asserted that he enjoyed family life with the Sponsor and
    that in light of the "historic injustice" relating to the  position  of
    former Ghurkha soldiers  and  their  families,  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance was a disproportionate  interference  with  his  family  life
    rights under Article 8.

 2. The judge concluded that the  Appellant  was  not  dependent  upon  the
    Sponsor and in turn that there was no family life between the two.   He
    based this conclusion on a lack  of  evidence  in  respect  of  certain
    matters of concern, but also on the ground, repeated frequently  within
    his decision, that the Sponsor had apparently made "frequent" trips  to
    Nepal, indicating that she was in receipt  of  additional  income  from
    some unknown source.

 3. The grounds of appeal assert, amongst other matters, that the judge was
    simply wrong to  have  concluded  that  the  Sponsor  had  been  making
    frequent or regular trips back to Nepal since her  admission  into  the
    United Kingdom for settlement in 2018.  The  grounds  assert  that  the
    evidence before the judge showed that she  had  in  fact  only  made  a
    single trip to Nepal, that being between September 2018 and July  2019.



 4. Permission was granted by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge  McClure
    on 10 December 2019.

 5. At the hearing before  me  Mr  Bramble  accepted  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law on the  basis  that  there  was  a  fundamental
    misapprehension of the evidence relating  to  the  Sponsor's  movements
    between the United Kingdom and Nepal.  He accepted that the evidence in
    fact showed that she had made  the  single  visit  alluded  to  in  the
    grounds of appeal and not the frequent or regular trips  found  by  the
    judge to have taken place.

 6. Mr Bramble was entirely right to make this concession.  It  is  unclear
    as to why the judge got the wrong end of the evidential  stick,  as  it
    were, but that he  did,  and  the  error  is  repeated  throughout  his
    decision.  It is quite clear that it played  a  material  part  in  his
    overall consideration of the Appellant's case, including the  existence
    of family life. Although the judge purported to  reach  an  alternative
    conclusion on the issue of "historical injustice" at para 64, in  light
    of the well-known case law on this  issue  I  conclude  it  is  clearly
    flawed.

 7. In light of the  above  I  set  the  judge's  decision  aside  with  no
    preserved findings of fact.

 8. Whilst the Appellant's representative submitted that this appeal should
    be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, I disagree.  The matter will be
    retained in the Upper Tribunal and set down for a  resumed  hearing  at
    which relevant evidence can be presented and findings of fact made.   I
    will issue appropriate directions below.

 9.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and  I  set
it aside.

This appeal is adjourned for a resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal.



No anonymity direction is made.



Directions to the parties

   1) Any further evidence from the Appellant shall be filed and  served  no
      later than 14 days before the resumed hearing. Such evidence shall  be
      accompanied by an  application  under  rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal
      Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008;



   2) Oral evidence from the  Sponsor  will  be  permitted  at  the  resumed
      hearing, but only if an  updated  witness  statement  is  provided  in
      compliance with direction 1, above.
