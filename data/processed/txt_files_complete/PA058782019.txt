               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Hussain, of Raiyad Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who claims to be at risk in
    his own country because he is gay.  The First-tier Tribunal accepted
    that the appellant is gay but applying the Supreme Court judgment in HJ
    (Iran) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 31 found that the appellant would not be at
    risk because he would be discrete for family/societal reasons rather
    than because he fears persecution.

 2. Mr Jarvis conceded that (a) the decision contained an error of law; and
    (b) the appeal should be remade in favour of the appellant.

 3. Mr Jarvis stated that he accepted that the findings of fact show a
    nexus between the appellant's sexuality and his fear of persecution in
    Bangladesh and that the evidence indicates that a material reason for
    the appellant's discretion on return would be fear of persecution.

 4. Mr Jarvis did not dispute that being openly gay in Bangladesh would put
    the appellant at risk of persecution.

 5. In the light of the concession by the respondent, the decision of the
    First-Tier Tribunal is set aside and I remake the decision by allowing
    the appeal.



Decision

The decision of the First-Tier Tribunal is set aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the appeal.
