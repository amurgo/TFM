For the Appellants:    Mr R Parkin (Counsel) instructed by Eagles
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. These are the appellants' appeals against the  decision  of  Judge  Fox
    made following a hearing at North Shields on 19 December 2016.



Background

 2. The appellants are citizens of India born on 15th June  1987  and  25th
    May 1983 respectively.

 3. On 14th May 2014 the first appellant made a  combined  application  for
    leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  under
    the points-based system which was refused with a right of appeal.   The
    appeal was allowed to the extent  that  it  be  remitted  back  to  the
    Secretary of State on the basis that the decision was not in accordance
    with the law and for a new decision to be made, and for  the  appellant
    to be allowed 60 days to pass an English language test and to obtain  a
    CAS.

 4. On 6th November 2015 the first  appellant  made  a  fresh  application,
    within the specified period, which was refused on the  basis  that  she
    had used a document which had been found  to  be  false  or  forged  in
    accordance with  paragraph  322(1)(a)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    paragraph 245ZX(a) of the Immigration Rules.

 5. She had applied for a course offered by St Leonard's College  and  paid
    course fees in excess of ï¿½7,000.  It subsequently transpired  that  the
    course offer did not exist and nor  did  the  college.   The  appellant
    reported the matter to the police and her solicitors referred it to the
    National Fraud Intelligence Bureau.

 6. The judge found that the appellant had  submitted  her  application  in
    good  faith  and  was  not  complicit  in  any  dishonesty  or   fraud.
    Nevertheless he dismissed the appeal under paragraph 322(1)(a) and  was
    not satisfied that there was an arguable case to be made for  leave  to
    be granted outside the Immigration Rules or in  respect  of  the  Human
    Rights Act 1998.

The Grounds of Application

 7. The appellants sought permission to appeal, which was initially refused
    by First-tier Judge O'Garro but subsequently granted by Upper  Tribunal
    Judge McWilliam.  The Grounds of Appeal set  out  the  history  of  the
    claim and argue both that Judge Fox's analysis of the appellant"s  case
    under Article 8 was inadequate and that the judge  had  not  considered
    the respondent's public law duty to act fairly.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing Mr Parkin produced both the case of Patel (revocation of
    sponsor  licence  -  fairness)  India  [2011]  UKUT   00211   and   the
    respondent's guidance in relation to  cases  where  a  Tier  4  Sponsor
    Licence has been revoked so that the CAS issued  by  the  sponsor  will
    become invalid.  He accepted that the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules but submitted that, in line  with
    the guidance, the respondent ought to have granted 60 days so that  the
    appellant could find another college.

 9.  Mrs  Pettersen  submitted  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 322(1)(a), which  required  a  refusal  where
    false documents had been submitted whether or not  to  the  applicant's
    knowledge and reminded me that the appellant had already had  a  period
    of 60 days in order to submit a further application.

Findings and Conclusions

10. It does not appear as though the fairness point pursued by Mr Parkin at
    the hearing was made  before  the  Immigration  Judge.   Ordinarily,  a
    determination should not be set aside on the basis of  arguments  which
    were not put.  However in this case it  is  a  Robinson  obvious  point
    which ought to have been pursued by the appellant's representative.

11. Accordingly, the determination is set aside  because  relevant  matters
    were not considered.

Findings and Conclusions

12. The appellant was found by the judge to be a credible witness  in  that
    he accepted unreservedly that she  had  been  the  innocent  victim  of
    fraud.

13. In Patel it was held that

         "Where the applicant is both innocent of any practice that  led  to
         loss of the sponsorship status and ignorant of  the  fact  of  such
         loss of status, it seems to us that common  law  fairness  and  the
         principle of treating applicants equally mean that each should have
         an equal opportunity to vary their application by affording them  a
         reasonable time with which to find a substitute college on which to
         base their application for an  extension  of  stay  to  obtain  the
         relevant qualification.  In  the  curtailment  cases  express  Home
         Office policy is to afford 60  days  for  such  application  to  be
         made."

14. Paragraph 11 of the Tier 4 policy guidance current at present,  and  it
    was not argued by Mrs Pettersen that it did not apply at  the  relevant
    date, states

         "If you have applied for leave to remain and the  only  ground  for
         refusing your application is  that  your  CAS  has  become  invalid
         following the revocation of your Tier 4  Sponsor's  Licence,  where
         your revoked sponsor is an overseas HEI, embedded college  offering
         pathway courses or an independent school, you will be given 60 days
         to regularise your stay or leave the UK".

15. The respondent does not contend that there was any material  difference
    between the position of this appellant and those  colleges  which  have
    been  removed  from  the  register  following  the  revocation  of  the
    sponsor's licence.  This college was on the register at the  time  that
    the appellant applied.  The fact that it would appear that she  applied
    to an institution which was in  fact  passing  itself  off  as  another
    institution is not material in this context.  She relied on information
    supplied by the respondent in making the application and acted in  good
    faith.   After  consideration,  Mrs  Pettersen  did  not   oppose   the
    submission that the appellant ought to be  granted  an  opportunity  to
    make another application within a 60 day period.

16. There is no error in  the  judge's  consideration  of  Article  8.   He
    reached a decision plainly open to him.  Neither is there any error  in
    his conclusion that the appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.

17. However the respondent did not apply the guidance which she set out  on
    her website and the judge's decision is  inconsistent  with  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision in Patel.

Decision

The original judge erred in law and  his  decision  is  set  aside.   It  is
remade as follows.   The  appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  insofar  as  the
respondent's decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  remains
outstanding, for a fresh decision to be made in line with the  guidance  set
out in the respondent's website.

No anonymity direction is made.
