Representation:

For the Appellant: Ms Masih, instructed by MP Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



The appellant is a national of India and was born on 10 November 1991.

This is an appeal by the appellant against the determination promulgated  on
2  January  2014  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Camp  which  refused  the
appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of  19  April  2013  to
refuse leave to remain as a spouse.

There are two challenges.

The first is that Judge Camp was in error in finding at [30] and  [33]  that
the sponsor had not shown that the  money  paid  to  her  by  Leicestershire
County Council could be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph  E-
LTRP.3.2. of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules so  could  not  show  that
she had a specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.

The  second  is  that  the  respondent  had  accepted  when   refusing   the
application that the appellant and sponsor were in a genuine and  subsisting
relationship. It had not been open to Judge Camp to go behind  that  without
clear notice being given to the appellant  so  that  he  could  address  the
point.

I was grateful to Ms Masih and Mr Mills for their submissions  on  a  narrow
but, certainly to me, novel point  concerning  how  the  sponsor's  payments
from Leicestershire County Council should be regarded.

Ms Masih maintained that the documents at pages 81,  91,  117,  118  of  the
appellant's first bundle of  evidence  (FB)  showed  that  the  sponsor  was
regarded by the local authority as "self-employed",  that  as  a  carer  she
could "earn" the money paid to her and that HMRC regarded the money paid  to
her by the local authority as "payments".

However, it appeared to me that the statement dated 9 December  2013  of  Ms
Sandhu, the appellant's  solicitor  which  is  at  pages  5  and  6  of  the
additional bundle of evidence  (AB)  held  the  answer  to  this  issue.  At
paragraph 6 the statement indicates that HMRC confirmed to Ms Sandhu that:

      "the income [the sponsor] receives from the council is considered as a
      turnover. From this turnover, any  expenses  she  has  including  gas,
      electric, grocery  bills,  usage  of  her  car,  money  spend  on  the
      household can be considered as expense and would be deducted from  her
      turnover. He explained that in most cases, once the expenses have been
      taken out, the remainder would be taxable profit and this is  why  the
      self assessment would be completed at �0.00,  as  once  expenses  have
      been calculated not much if anything  is  left  to  be  taxed.  Donald
      advised for the purpose of this type of care which is provided via the
      Council, this is the simplest way of calculating the expenses."

The funds paid to the sponsor are not "income"  or  "profit",  or  earnings,
therefore, even if that is how the local authority refers to them. They  are
"turnover" from which significant expenses inevitably will follow such  that
HMRC concede that, up to  a  certain  qualifying  amount,  no  tax  will  be
payable.

That approach is consistent with the other HMRC documents  before  me.  Page
91 of FB shows that  HMRC  regarded  the  funds  paid  to  the  sponsor  for
taxation purposes as having no profit (or loss). Page 185 of AB states  that
for tax purposes the sponsor has made no profit. Where  funds  are  paid  by
the local authority above the qualifying allowance, as the examples at  page
93 of FB and page 190 of AB show, tax  becomes  payable  as  the  person  is
deemed to have made a profit, in my view, a amount of money which  could  be
considered as income for the purposes of the Immigration Rules. That is  not
the case here where the evidence is consistently that the  sponsor  has  not
paid any tax on any payments from the local authority  as,  in  effect,  the
payments covered only expenses.

This is also the position set out in the personal accounts drawn up  by  the
sponsor's accountants at 119 of FB. Those accounts show that almost  all  of
the funds paid by the  local  authority  go  on  "Fixed  expenses"  for  two
adults. Those adults cannot be the appellant or sponsor or  members  of  her
family. They are the two adults who live in the sponsor's home, referred  to
in the accountant's notes at the  bottom  of  page  119.  That  is  entirely
consistent with the position regarding tax taken by HMRC.

Even if there is a percentage of the funds from the local  authority  which,
regardless of how it is treated by HMRC, is included in the payments as  the
equivalent of a salary or income for the person providing housing, Ms  Masih
could not show me how  such  a  percentage  could  be  calculated  from  the
documentation before me.

Where those matters are so, I did not find that Judge Camp erred in  finding
that the finance requirements of the Immigration Rules were not met.

I indicated at the hearing that it did appear to me that  Judge  Camp  erred
in failing to put the appellant on notice that he  had  concerns  about  the
genuine nature of the marriage so that the appellant had an  opportunity  to
address those concerns. Judge Camp's findings should not be relied  upon  as
a starting point  by  the  respondent  in  any  future  application  or  the
Tribunal in any future appeal, therefore.

The error as regards a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  could  not  be
material, however. The application under the substantive  Immigration  Rules
had to fail because the financial requirements were not met. In  an  Article
8 assessment, the requirements of the Immigration Rules and failure to  meet
them is the starting point in the Article 8 assessment.  Here,  the  sponsor
can be expected to return to seek entry clearance and being expected  to  do
so   cannot   reach   the   threshold   of   compelling   circumstances   or
exceptionality; Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules -  correct  approach)  [2013]
UKUT 00460 (IAC) applied.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  a  material  error
on a point of law and shall stand.
