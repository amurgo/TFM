                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Fowell, promulgated on 11th February 2015, following a hearing at
    Newport on 9th February 2015.  In the determination, the judge  allowed
    the appeal of Mrs Satya Devi Chumber.  The Respondent  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, subsequently applied  for,  and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India, is a female, and was born on  13th
    April 1939.  She is 75 years of age.  On 10th January 2014, she applied
    for entry clearance from India under European  Community  law,  as  the
    family member of an  EEA  national,  her  daughter-in-law,  Mrs  Zaneta
    Hulisz, who is a Polish national.  That  application  was  rejected  on
    12th February 2014 on the  basis  that  the  documentary  evidence  was
    limited, the entire financial picture was unclear, and  that,  all  the
    money was being sent by the son of the Appellant,  Mr  Jasvir  Chumber,
    and his wife, Mrs Zaneta Hulisz, who is also a Sponsor, it was  unclear
    how this money was being sent, given that the Appellant also  had  five
    daughters living in India who were in a position to support  her.   The
    Appellant submitted her appeal on 10th March 2014 under  Regulation  26
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

The Judge's Findings

 3. In what is a careful, comprehensive, and  detailed  determination,  the
    judge set out the issues, the evidence  before  him,  the  reasons  for
    refusal by the Respondent, and the applicable law in this complex  area
    of jurisdiction.  The judge also heard evidence  from  the  Appellant's
    son, Mr Jasvir Chumber, and her  daughter-in-law,  Mrs  Zaneta  Hulisz.
    The evidence was that Mr Chumber had been  sending  money  via  Western
    Union, every month, or a month and a half, for �200 or �300,  and  that
    there was also a 20,000 rupee deposit n 18th June 2013.   The  evidence
    also was that given that the fifth sister of the son  in  the  UK,  was
    also now married, "There is no-one to care for  his  mother  in  India.
    They go to her home to visit but they do not have enough money to  give
    her any" (see paragraph 9(h)).

 4. As against that, the judge heard the Respondent's submissions that  the
    Appellant had to show  that  at  the  time  of  the  decision  she  was
    financially dependent on  her  sponsoring  children  in  the  UK.   The
    remittance slips do not  show  how  the  money  was  being  spent  (see
    paragraph 11).

 5. The judge thereafter went  on  to  set  out  the  law  in  relation  to
    dependency.  In particular, after referring to Jia (at  paragraph  15),
    the judge went on to deal with Moneke (paragraph 16),  which  confirmed
    that,

         "It does not  matter  that  the  applicant  may  in  addition  seek
         financial support/income from other sources.  There is no  need  to
         determine  the  reasons  for  recourse  to  the  financial  support
         provided by the EEA national or to consider whether  the  applicant
         is able to support him/herself by taking up  paid  employment  ..."
         (see paragraph 16 of the determination).

 6. The Tribunal in Moneke had also stated (at paragraph 42) that, "An able
    bodied person who chooses to rely for his essential needs  on  material
    support of the Sponsor may be entitled to do so even if he  could  meet
    those needs from his or her economic activity" (see paragraph 17 of the
    determination).

 7. After reciting further case law (see paragraphs 18 to  19),  the  judge
    dealt with the latest case of Reyes (from  January  2014),  which  held
    that "The fact that a Union citizen regularly  and  for  a  significant
    period paid a sum of money  to  a  descendant  necessary  in  order  to
    support her in the country of origin  was  enough  to  prove  that  the
    descendant was in a real situation of dependence" (see paragraph 20  of
    the determination).

 8. Finally, after setting out in detail the Western Union money transfers,
    of which the judge had sight, he set out the trail  of  remittances  of
    anything between �250 to over �300 (see paragraph 24).  The judge  then
    concluded that, "This is evidence  of  regular  support,  amounting  to
    about �2,000 over the course of a year" (paragraph 26).  As to how this
    money was being spent, the judge referred to the evidence already given
    by the two Sponsors before him and he held that, "I found  them  to  be
    sincere and consistent.  Neither said more than they knew or  attempted
    to embellish matters" (paragraph 27).  Whilst the judge  was  concerned
    of the "lack of earlier evidence of payments" (paragraph 29)  he  found
    himself  able  to  conclude  that  the  Appellant  had  been  able   to
    demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that there was a dependency
    of necessity here.

 9. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge failed to  have  regard
    to the case of (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00341 (IAC) with regard
    as to how the money being remitted from the UK was being spent  by  the
    Appellant mother in order to establish  if  some,  or  all  of  it,  is
    required for essential living needs.

11. Permission to appeal was subsequently given by the First-tier Tribunal.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on  29th  May  2015,  Miss  Brocklesby-Weller,
    appearing on behalf of the Respondent, submitted that there was only  a
    very discrete point involved in this  appeal.   Although  a  number  of
    authorities had been cited by the judge, the crucial question  was  not
    grasped by the judge, namely, as to how the money being  remitted  from
    the UK was spent by the  Appellant.   It  was  not  clear  whether  the
    remittances were directly related to the meeting  of  essential  needs.
    The judge had failed to make a finding of fact in relation to this.

13. Second, the issue was important  given  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    living in her own home for 41 years and there was no  evidence  of  any
    particular needs that had risen in these years that had to  be  met  by
    the children of the Appellant, and  certainly  not  by  the  sponsoring
    daughter-in-law from the UK.

14. Third, the judge was suitably concerned about the  "lack  of  evidence"
    going back to the time when the first  application  had  been  made  to
    sponsor the Appellant to come to  the  UK  as  a  dependant.   It  was,
    accordingly, necessary for the judge to take a holistic approach.

15. For his part, Mr Jasvir Chumber, being  legally  unrepresented,  simply
    repeated what he had said before the judge below, namely, that  he  had
    routinely been sending, together with his wife, anything  between  �200
    to �300 for his mother's regular needs, and these had been specifically
    referred to by the judge in the determination, before he concluded that
    the appeal should be allowed.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2011) such that I should set aside this decision.  My reasons  are
    as follows.

17. First, the decision of the judge is entirely in accordance with the law
    as set out in the determination.  The latest case of Reyes (referred to
    at paragraph 20 of the determination), makes it clear that if "a  Union
    citizen regularly and for a significant period" sends money, then  this
    is enough to prove that the descendant  was  in  a  real  situation  of
    dependence.

18. Second, the suggestion that the requirement of  (EEA  -  OFMs)  Nigeria
    [2011] UKUT 00341 (IAC), is not met because the judge has not been able
    to explain how the monies remitted is being  spent,  is  unsustainable.
    This is because, upon considering the evidence, the judge made a  clear
    finding of fact that, "The Appellant's bank balance does not  show  any
    other sources of income, and the reserve it contains  is  of  the  size
    required for an air fare to the UK" (paragraph 28).

19. What this means, and this is a finding of the judge, is  that  whatever
    small amount of help that  the  other  relatives  in  India  give,  the
    essential needs of the Appellant are met really on  the  basis  of  the
    remittances sent from the UK by her son and daughter-in-law.  This  was
    a finding that the judge was entirely entitled to make.  The appeal  by
    the Respondent amounts to nothing more than  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings of the judge.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
