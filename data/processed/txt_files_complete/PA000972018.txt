                                   Between

                                 ENEYAT [A]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 26 September I wrote to the parties as follows:

         "Following the grant of permission, the  respondent  has  responded
         under rule 24, accepting that the failure to  have  regard  to  the
         medical evidence and the joint presidential guidance on  vulnerable
         witnesses was fatal to the assessment of credibility, and  inviting
         the Upper Tribunal to remit the appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal
         for a fresh hearing.

         I propose to  accept  that  invitation.   Any  submissions  to  the
         contrary will be considered if received within 21 days of the  date
         of this letter."

 2. No submissions have been received.  I now set aside  the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal for error or law and remit  the  appellant's
    appeal for fresh consideration by that Tribunal.


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                      Date: 31 October 2018.
