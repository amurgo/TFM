                            DECISION AND REASONS



1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal to refuse her leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  on
   private and family life grounds.  She is a United States citizen but  her
   husband and three children, now aged  14,  12  and  8,  are  all  British
   citizens.

Background

2. The appellant is a citizen of the  United  States:  she  was  born  on  a
   United States Air Force Base, and was naturalised at birth.  Her  father,
   who is of Puerto Rican origin, was then serving in the  Canal  Zone.  The
   appellant and her father are estranged and have been since 2001, when she
   met her husband and subsequently came to the United Kingdom to marry him.

3. The appellant met her husband in  2001  in  the  United  States  when  he
   visited there.  In April 2002, she entered the United Kingdom on a  visit
   visa, with the intention of marrying him.  On 15 June 2002,  the  parties
   married and following her marriage,  the  appellant  obtained  indefinite
   leave to remain as her  husband's  spouse,  without  leaving  the  United
   Kingdom.

4. The appellant has not lived in the  United  States  since  2001,  and  is
   estranged from her father since then.  She has  not  worked  since  2003,
   when she had her first child, born in the United Kingdom.  The  appellant
   and her husband own a property in London from which they  receive  rental
   income (about �30,000 a year). In about 2003, the parties left the United
   Kingdom.

5. From 2003 to 2010, the family lived in  Syria,  because  the  appellant's
   husband was studying Arabic at Damascus University.  The  husband  worked
   as an English teacher.  They had two more children during  this  time,  a
   boy born in 2005 and a girl in 2009.  The children are all home  schooled
   by the appellant.  The family returned to the United Kingdom for  visits,
   from time to time, and would have been made aware that the wife had  lost
   her indefinite leave to remain after 2 years living abroad.

6. In 2010, the family moved to Egypt  which  was  a  safer  place  for  the
   appellant's husband to continue his Arabic studies. They  remained  there
   on tourist visas, which they renewed to enable  them  to  stay.   Neither
   party worked during the family's time in Egypt: the family lived  on  the
   rental income from their London property (about �2500 a month, or �30,000
   per annum).

7. In 2011, there was a revolution in Egypt and the family  eventually  felt
   that it had become unsafe for foreigners.  In 2013, they moved to Turkey,
   where they found the visa situation easier.  In 2014, the husband decided
   to return to the  United  Kingdom  and  set  up  a  business  here.   The
   appellant remained in Turkey, caring for the three  children  there,  for
   about 11 months.  She found it difficult and stressful to manage the home
   and her family in her husband's absence.  In  the  end,  the  appellant's
   husband accepted that the separation  was  just  too  difficult  for  the
   appellant, and that the whole family should come to the United Kingdom.

8. On 7 March 2015, the whole family returned to  the  United  Kingdom.   On
   their return in 2015, the appellant and her family had been  outside  the
   United Kingdom for over 13 years.  Indefinite leave to remain is lost  if
   a person is outside the United Kingdom for more than 2 years.

9. The parties did  not  give  much  thought  to  the  basis  on  which  the
   appellant could stay in the United Kingdom.   The  appellant  had  always
   been able to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor, since they left,  and
   expected that in March 2015, the same would be true.

10. The appellant's husband and children  had  no  difficulty  entering  the
   country, as they are British citizens.  The appellant was interviewed  by
   an immigration officer who offered two options, either to return  to  the
   United States and make an application to come to the United Kingdom as  a
   spouse, or to enter on a six-month visit visa.  The appellant  chose  the
   visit visa option.  She expected  that  she  would  be  able  to  make  a
   successful application for leave to remain once here.

11. The appellant's case is that the children  are  now  settled  back  into
   their country of nationality and it would be unreasonable to expect  them
   to leave.   She continues to home school the two younger children,  which
   she has done since they were born, but they have developed a wide network
   of home-schooled friends and take part in many activities here.

12. The elder boy, who is 14, is in mainstream education here: he  found  it
   difficult to settle in the first year, but is now doing well and will  be
   beginning to study for his GCSEs soon. The appellant and her  husband  do
   not wish to disrupt his education  again  at  this  important  time.  The
   family has relocated many times, and it has taken  its  toll  on  all  of
   them.  The appellant and her husband consider that the children  need  to
   begin putting down roots and developing relationships.

13. After coming to the  United  Kingdom,  the  appellant  and  her  husband
   initially lived with the husband's brother and his  wife,  but  have  now
   bought their own home, where they live with the husband's mother, who has
   several medical conditions, including breast cancer (diagnosed in  2016),
   hypertension, and diabetes.  The appellant goes to  medical  appointments
   with her mother-in-law and supports her emotionally: they  have  a  close
   bond.  Her brother-in-law and his wife are not involved with the mother's
   care.

14. The appellant's  husband  continues  to  study  Arabic.   The  husband's
   business is not doing well, certainly not  well  enough  to  support  two
   homes, one in the United Kingdom and  one  in  the  United  States.   The
   appellant considers it unlikely that he would be allowed to move  to  the
   United States but has not researched that possibility.

Refusal letter

15. During the currency of her visit visa, the appellant applied  for  leave
   to remain but the respondent refused, both under the partner  and  parent
   routes, and outside the Rules on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

16. The respondent noted that the appellant could not meet the  requirements
   of the partner  or  parent  routes,  and  that  therefore  EX.1  was  not
   applicable.  Under the partner route, E-LTRP.2.1(a) specifically excludes
   those who are in the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor.   Under  the  parent
   route, E-LTRPT.2.3 excludes those who do not have sole responsibility for
   a child and E.LTRPT.3.1 also excludes those who are in the United Kingdom
   as a visitor.  Again, EX.1 was inapplicable.

17. The respondent considered paragraph 276ADE but the appellant  could  not
   meet the residence requirements of that rule.

18. Under exceptional circumstances, the respondent  acknowledged  that  the
   appellant had a  British  spouse  and  three  British  citizen  children.
   However, the appellant could  not  meet  the  Rules  and  should  not  be
   permitted to circumvent them: she should apply for entry  clearance  from
   abroad.

19. The section 55 best interests of the children  were  briefly  considered
   but no weight was given to  the  home  schooling  of  her  children.  The
   respondent recognised that as British citizens, the children could not be
   expected  to  go  and  live  elsewhere,  but  she  considered  that   the
   appellant's British husband could  look  after  the  children  while  she
   applied for re-entry to the United Kingdom.

20. Alternatively, despite their right to grow up  in  the  United  Kingdom,
   the respondent considered that the children, and the appellant's husband,
   could return together with her to the United States,  where  family  life
   could be enjoyed together and there would be only a proportionate  degree
   of  disruption  to  their  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
   respondent did not consider that a grant of leave outside the  Rules  was
   appropriate.

21. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

22. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that the  appellant  had  private
   and family life with her husband and children,  established  long  before
   their return to the United Kingdom  and  not  while  she  had  precarious
   leave.  The private and family life developed by  the  appellant  in  the
   United Kingdom since her arrival was, however, developed while her  leave
   here was precarious  and  in  accordance  with  section  117B(5)  of  the
   Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (as  amended),  the  Judge
   attached little weight to that.

23. He did not consider that the mother-in-law's needs  were  sufficient  to
   amount to  exceptional  circumstances.  The  Judge  considered  that  the
   attitude of the adult parties was too casual: they were  educated  people
   with experience of living in many countries and he did not  believe  that
   they had been unable to understand the  online  materials  about  how  to
   apply for indefinite leave to remain.  The appellant's husband  had  been
   in the United Kingdom for 11 months before returning to Turkey to collect
   his family and the Judge considered that in that time he would have taken
   advice on relocating  and  re-establishing  family  life  in  the  United
   Kingdom.

24.  The  Judge  accepted  at  [50]  that  this  family   would   experience
   significant difficulties in obtaining immigration status for the  husband
   in the United States  and  that  it  would  not  be  reasonable  for  the
   children, who are  British  citizens,  to  relocate  there,  particularly
   having regard to their current ages and circumstances.

25. The Judge considered it reasonable for the appellant to  return  to  the
   United States:  he accepted that she left there 16 years ago, has no real
   current family ties now, and has not worked since the birth of her  first
   child in 2003.  The husband had a sister in Florida and it had  not  been
   suggested  that  she  could  not  accommodate  the  appellant  in   these
   circumstances.  The Judge found that requiring the appellant to go to the
   United States would interfere with her family life rights but  considered
   that such interference was proportionate.

26. The Judge did not consider it unduly harsh  or  unreasonable  to  expect
   the appellant to return to the United States and comply with  the  United
   Kingdom Immigration Rules, as she should have done  before  coming  here.
   Any interference  with  her  private  and  family  life  rights,  or  her
   husband's right to study, was proportionate in the circumstances.

27. The Judge made no express findings about the children's section 55  best
   interests, in particular the difficulties the older child had experienced
   in adapting to  mainstream  schooling,  and  the  home-education  of  the
   younger two.  He considered that the separation would not  be  for  long:
   the appellant's husband would meet the financial requirements of Appendix
   FM-SE by reason of the �30,000 income per annum from the London property.
    The husband was not currently working and would be able to care for  the
   children while the appellant regularised her status.

Grounds of appeal

28. The appellant sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  She
   argued, first, that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  finding  that  it
   would be proportionate for her to return and  make  her  application  for
   entry clearance from the United States, relying on Chikwamba v  Secretary
   of State for the Home Department  [2008]  UKHL  40  and  the  public  law
   principle of consistency in decision making (see R on the application  of
   Golam Mowla v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1992] 1 WLR  70
   CA, which concerned  the  failure  of  the  respondent  to  exercise  her
   discretion to give leave to enter and indefinite leave to remain  on  the
   merits.

29. The appellant argued that she had told the immigration officer that  she
   wished to enter for settlement, not as a visitor, and  that  it  was  the
   immigration officer who advised her to enter and then apply for leave  to
   remain.  In addition, the Judge had failed to have  any,  or  any  proper
   regard, to the appellant's home schooling the children,  whose  education
   would be interrupted if she were removed.

30. Secondly, the appellant contended that the Judge's reasons at  [47]  and
   [49] were inadequate. A lay person, however intelligent, could not have a
   proper understanding of the complexity of the Rules, which were difficult
   even for lawyers to interpret (see Pokhriyal v Secretary of State for the
   Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1568 at [4]  and  Singh  v  Secretary  of
   State for  the  Home  Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  74  at  [59]).   The
   appellant's solicitors had sent a covering letter invoking EX.1 which the
   respondent had failed to understand.

Permission to appeal

31. Permission to appeal was given on the basis that the  Judge  had  failed
   to make  proper  findings  on  the  section  55  best  interests  of  the
   appellant's children, or to give weight to  the  home  education  of  the
   younger two children.  Nor had  the  Judge  considered  paragraph  117(6)
   which, given that she has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  her
   British citizen children, indicated that there was no public interest  in
   her removal.

Rule 24 Reply

32. The respondent in her  Rule  24  Reply  considered  that  the  appellant
   should return to the United States.  She relied on R on  the  application
   of Chan v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  (Appendix  FM  -
   Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015 UKUT  00189
   and argued that it was open to the respondent to consider  the  appellant
   returning to the United States on that basis.

33. The Reply continued:

         "3.  It is submitted that the Judge has considered all the relevant
         factors in relation to the children and the family as a whole.   It
         is submitted that the Judge, although  not  having  expressed  this
         directly with  the  term  'best  interests',  has  found  that  the
         appellant's best interest lie  in  them  remaining  in  the  United
         Kingdom, given her findings that requiring the  children  to  leave
         the United Kingdom would be too much of an upheaval  for  them  and
         finds that they have the benefit of wider family members  and  that
         separation would not cause a significant impact  on  the  children.
         ... As such, the Judge found it reasonable for the interference.

         4.   Given the above finding, it is submitted that the  appellant's
         claim was bound to fail  and  it  is  submitted  that  the  failure
         explicitly to reference section 117B is  not  material,  given  the
         Judges  consideration  that  the  separation  is   reasonable   and
         proportionate has considered all the relevant  factors  under  that
         section. ...The grounds suggest that the  appellant  would  succeed
         solely under section 117B(6) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002 (as amended); however, in light of AM (Pakistan)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 180,  it
         is clear the section 117B(6) is  not  a  standalone  provision  and
         still needs to be considered in  the  light  of  the  wider  public
         interest.  The Judge having had regard to the wider public interest
         found that separation was proportionate and as such it is submitted
         that the outcome of the appeal would remain the same. ..."

34. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

35. In argument before me, Mr Karnik repeated elements  of  the  grounds  of
   appeal above and  contended  that  the  appellant's  behaviour  had  been
   straightforward and above board.  There was no deception or  misbehaviour
   by her.   He  argued  that  at  [55]  in  the  decision,  the  Judge  had
   misdirected himself as to the balancing exercise to  be  undertaken,  and
   that his consideration of Article 8 was skewed  by  that,  since  Article
   117B(6) was not considered at all.

36. For  the  respondent,  Mr  Bates  noted  that  the  appellant's  husband
   intended to study in the United  Kingdom  and  was  also  the  children's
   parent.  He could carry on home-schooling them in her absence, and in any
   event, the eldest  child  was  now  studying  at  a  state  school.   The
   appellant could not meet the requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  and  thus
   Chikwamba did not apply as there  was  no  certainty  of  success.  Also,
   Chikwamba had been overtaken by the integration of Article  8  ECHR  into
   the Immigration Rules and should not now be treated as good  law  on  the
   Rules as they now stood.

37. The basic point was that a 6-month visit visa should not be a  route  to
   settlement; the appellant needed to make an out of  country  application.
   She would experience some difficulty as she was now an  overstayer.   The
   immigration officer could not give to the appellant a right which did not
   in law exist, and there was little  weight  in  the  other  circumstances
   relied upon.

38. If the Tribunal found a material error of law, Mr  Bates  said  that  he
   would have very little argument against allowing the appeal  outside  the
   Rules.

39.  Responding  for  the  appellant,  Mr  Karnik  said  that  it  would  be
   disproportionate to remove the appellant as this was the only country  in
   the world where the appellant and her family could live together safely.

40. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Discussion

41. This appellant did not have a Returning Resident visa on  7  March  2015
   when  she  sought  to  re-enter  the  United  Kingdom.   As  far  as  the
   requirements of the Immigration Rules (the partner and parent routes  and
   paragraph 276ADE) are concerned, the choice which the immigration officer
   gave the appellant between returning to the United States or entering  on
   a visit visa and applying for leave to remain  during  its  currency  was
   unhelpful.  Entry on a visit visa bars her  from  both  the  partner  and
   parent routes, and she has not lived  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  long
   enough to meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE.

42. The question is therefore whether her removal to the  United  States  to
   make that application is proportionate under Article 8  ECHR.   I  accept
   that Chikwamba is inapplicable  here:  this  is  not  a  case  where  the
   appellant is certain of success under the Rules, and  Chikwamba  predates
   the present form of the Rules.

43. There is no section 55 best interests finding, which is itself an  error
   of law.  It is normally in the best interests of children  to  live  with
   both their parents: in the case of these children,  they  have  lived  in
   Syria and Egypt under difficult  circumstances,  and  in  Turkey  without
   their  father  under  circumstances  in  which  he  concluded  that   the
   separation was too hard and the family should be reunited.  The elder boy
   had real difficulty adapting to  state  education  when  he  reached  the
   United Kingdom and he is of an age where his GCSE studies  are  about  to
   begin.  The younger two have been home-educated  by  this  appellant  for
   their whole lives.  All of these matters add weight to the best interests
   consideration but may not be determinative overall.

44. There remains the question of  proportionality  under  Article  8  ECHR.
   The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that removal was  proportionate,  but
   did not consider section 117 B(6) of the 2002 act.  Section 117A  of  the
   2002 Act requires a Court or Tribunal  in  all  cases  to  consider  'the
   public interest question', that is to say, whether an interference with a
   person's right to respect for private and family life is justified  under
   Article 8(2), and to have regard to the considerations listed in  section
   117B.

45. Section 117B(1) provides that the maintenance of  effective  immigration
   controls is in the public interest, but section 117B(6) qualifies that:

         "(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

46. The apparent conflict between those two  provisions  was  considered  by
   the Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan) & Ors, R (on the application  of)  v
   Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) & Anor  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
   705 and I am guided by the following passage in  the  judgment  of  Lord
   Justice Elias at [17] and :

         "17.     Subsection (6) ... does not simply identify factors  which
         bear upon the public interest question. It resolves  that  question
         in  the  context  of  article  8  applications  which  satisfy  the
         conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b). It  does  so  by  stipulating
         that once those conditions are satisfied, the public interest  will
         not require the applicant's removal. Since  the  interference  with
         the right to private or family life under article 8(1) can only  be
         justified where  there  is  a  sufficiently  strong  countervailing
         public interest falling within article 8(2), if the public interest
         does not require removal, there is no other basis on which  removal
         could be justified. It follows, in my judgment, that there  can  be
         no doubt that section 117B(6) must  be  read  as  a  self-contained
         provision in the sense that Parliament has  stipulated  that  where
         the conditions specified in  the  sub-section  are  satisfied,  the
         public interest will not justify removal. It is not  legitimate  to
         have regard  to  public  interest  considerations  unless  that  is
         permitted, either  explicitly  or  implicitly,  by  the  subsection
         itself.

         ...

         19.  In my judgment, therefore, the only questions which courts and
         tribunals need  to  ask  when  applying  section  117B(6)  are  the
         following:

             (1) Is the applicant liable to  deportation?  If  so,  section
             117B is  inapplicable  and  instead  the  relevant  code  will
             usually be found in section 117C.
             (2) Does the applicant have a genuine and subsisting  parental
             relationship with the child?
             (3) Is the child a qualifying  child  as  defined  in  section
             117D?
             (4) Is it unreasonable to expect the child to leave the United
             Kingdom?

         If the answer to the first question is no, and to the  other  three
         questions is  yes,  the  conclusion  must  be  that  article  8  is
         infringed.

         ...

         40.  ... Had Parliament intended to require considerations  bearing
         upon the conduct and immigration history of the applicant parent to
         be taken into consideration, I would have expected  it  to  say  so
         expressly, not for the matter to have to be inferred  from  a  test
         which in terms focuses on an assessment of what is  reasonable  for
         the child. This does not in my view  mean  that  the  wider  public
         interests have been ignored;  it  is  simply  that  Parliament  has
         determined that where the seven-year  rule  is  satisfied  and  the
         other conditions in the section have been  met,  those  potentially
         conflicting public interests will not suffice to justify refusal of
         leave if, focusing  on  the  position  of  the  child,  it  is  not
         reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the  UK.  When  section
         117A(2)(a) refers to the need for courts and tribunals to take into
         account the considerations identified in section 117B in all cases,
         that would not in my view have been intended  to  include  specific
         circumstances where Parliament must be taken to have had regard  to
         those matters."

47. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  did  not  consider  the  guidance  in  MA
   (Pakistan).  The answers in this appeal to the questions at [19] in  that
   judgment are:  no, the appellant is not liable to deportation;  yes,  she
   has a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  her  three
   children, all of whom are qualifying children under section 117D  because
   they are British citizens; and the  Judge  found  at  [50]  that  it  was
   unreasonable for the children to be expected to leave the United Kingdom.

48. On the basis of those answers, there can be only  one  outcome  to  this
   appeal, and that is that the appellant succeeds.  The First-tier Tribunal
   erred in law in failing to apply MA (Pakistan) and its decision  will  be
   set aside and remade to that effect.

DECISION

49. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.
   I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by allowing the
   appeal.
