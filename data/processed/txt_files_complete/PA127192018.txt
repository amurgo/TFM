Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms. E. Sanders, Counsel, instructed by Bindmans LLP
For the respondent:    Mr. T. Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1. The appellant is a national of Jamaica. He is presently aged 20. He
   appeals against a decision to refuse him leave to remain in this country
   on human rights grounds. The respondent previously made a decision to
   deport the appellant to Jamaica.

2. The appeal was initially considered by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
   O'Garro who allowed it on article 3 grounds by means of a decision dated
   27 June 2019. The respondent appealed against the decision of Judge
   O'Garro and following an error of law hearing held on 17 September 2019 I
   found that the Judge had materially erred in law and set aside her
   decision. I directed that save for the findings made in relation to the
   1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees no other findings were to
   stand. The error of law decision was sent to the parties on 25 September
   2019.

3. The matter was listed before me for the resumed hearing on 23 January
   2020.

Anonymity

4. I issued an anonymity direction on 25 September 2019 and no application
   was made by either party for it to be set aside. I therefore confirm that
   the following direction remains in place:

         'Unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise, no report
         of these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall
         directly or indirectly identify the appellant, his partner or close
         members of his family. This direction applies to, amongst others,
         the appellant and the respondent. Any failure to comply with this
         direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.'

5. I make the direction to avoid a likelihood of serious harm arising to
   the appellant from his mental health concerns becoming known to the
   general public.

Background

6. The appellant's mother died when he was aged 1 and he then lived with a
   maternal aunt in Jamaica until he was approximately aged 11. Following a
   successful appeal before the First-tier Tribunal in February 2011 the
   appellant was granted a settlement visa valid from 8 June 2010 and was
   permitted to join his father in this country (OA/17001/2010). Settlement
   was backdated so as to be valid from the date of the original refusal
   decision. The appellant has enjoyed lawful residence in this country
   since the grant of settled status, a period of approaching ten years.

7. Upon his arrival in this country the appellant was reunited with his
   father. Unfortunately, he experienced difficulties residing with his
   father and when aged 13 he moved to reside with a female cousin. Problems
   arose in their relationship and from November 2015 he was looked after by
   the London Borough of Lewisham. A foster placement broke down relatively
   quickly in 2016 and at the age of 17 he was placed in semi-independent
   living accommodation.

8. For the purpose of the Children Act 1989, as amended by the Children
   (Leaving Care) Act 2000, the appellant remains a 'former relevant child'
   until he reaches his twenty-first birthday and the local authority has a
   duty to assist him in respect of employment, education, training and
   contributing to the expenses of accommodation.

Criminal convictions

9. Since the summer of 2016 the appellant has accumulated several
   convictions for possessing class A drugs (heroin and cocaine) with intent
   to supply and possession of class B drugs (cannabis). All but one of the
   offences were committed when the appellant was aged 17 and 18. He was
   initially sentenced to fines and a youth rehabilitation order but on 18
   January 2018 the Central London Magistrates' Court revoked the youth
   rehabilitation order and imposed a 12-month detention and training order.

10. On 1 November 2017 the appellant was sentenced to 28 days at a Young
   Offenders' Institute for contempt of court. This arose from the
   appellant's unwillingness to support a criminal prosecution through
   personal fear.

11. On 8 October 2018 the appellant was fined for possessing a class B drug
   (cannabis).



Decision to deport

12. Following the imposition of the 12-months' detention and training order
   on 18 January 2018, the respondent served upon the appellant a decision
   to deport on conducive to the public good grounds under section 5(1) of
   the Immigration Act 1971. This decision is dated 6 March 2018. The
   appellant subsequently made a protection and human rights claim based
   upon the high level of crime in Jamaica and his own personal
   circumstances. The respondent refused the protection and human rights
   claim by means of a decision dated 22 October 2018. The respondent
   concluded that the asylum claim did not raise a Convention ground, and as
   to the humanitarian protection claim there was a sufficiency of
   protection existing in Jamaica.

13. The respondent observed as to article 8 that under paragraph 399A the
   appellant was unable to satisfy the requirement that he have lawfully
   resided in the United Kingdom for most of his life. The respondent
   further concluded that very compelling circumstances do not arise in this
   matter so as to outweigh the public interest in the appellant's
   deportation.

Hearing

14. The appellant attended the hearing before me and gave oral evidence. A
   friend, Karen Williams, gave oral evidence as did Conrad Brady, his
   personal advisor from the local authority Leaving Care Team. The
   appellant's partner, LJ, who is pregnant with the couple's child,
   attended but did not give evidence. Though not living together, I was
   informed that the couple see each other regularly.

15. The appellant provided details as to the reasons why he was taken into
   care and also as to events surrounded the death of a friend by means of
   his witness statement dated 29 April 2019. Such personal history is given
   weight in my assessment below, but I have concluded that it is not
   necessary for me to expressly detail such history in this decision.

16. As to his prior criminality, the appellant details in his witness
   statement:


         'It was around this time that I got into trouble. I really do
         regret my actions and I am sorry for the trouble that I have
         caused. I was in a bad way and vulnerable at that time. I got in
         with a bad crowd who I thought at the time were helping me and I
         thought they were friends, but I realise now that were not. They
         were older than me and started buying me things and treating me and
         then they got me into trouble. I really wanted to be liked and was
         happy that they seemed to want to be my friends. I suppose you
         could I was exploited by them. I am not in touch with these people
         any longer. I am trying hard to mend my ways.'


17. In his evidence before me the appellant confirmed that his personal
   feelings were variable, up and down, but that he was not taking
   medication. He is now living on his own, having until two months
   previously lived in a flat with four other young adults under
   supervision. The move is part of a process of enabling him to become more
   independent. He is spending several days a week with LJ, who had occupied
   her own property for approximately a month prior to the hearing before
   me. He confirmed that he had not completed educational courses that he
   had embarked upon prior to the First-tier Tribunal hearing, nor had he
   pursued a business plan relating to the clothing industry. He explained
   that both events were consequent to his being unable to establish that he
   was lawfully present in this country. He confirmed that he has two aunts
   residing in Jamaica, and also a half-brother with whom he has had limited
   contact via Facebook but there has been no contact since the appellant
   went to prison in 2018.

18. The appellant was supported by Mr. Brady who confirmed that he had
   regular contact with the appellant, who he observed was 'transitioning in
   terms of maturity, particularly as he will soon be a father' and in
   recent times was 'communicating on another level'.

19. Ms. Williams adopted her witness statement in which she detailed:


         'I know [the appellant] got lost along the way and he has made some
         poor choices. I am a social worker and I have spoken to him about
         his criminal convictions. He was vulnerable and made an error of
         judgment. I believe that he really wanted to make the most of his
         chance of coming to the UK, but he was vulnerable and started
         listening to the wrong people. When I see him now, I check in with
         him and the way [the appellant] speaks is with honest regret. I
         think his intentions are good, genuine and honourable. He wants to
         do something with his life. He has talked to me about the fact that
         he may have to return to Jamaica. He wasn't angry when he told me.
         He spoke with sadness and humility. He realises that his place in
         the UK is at serious risk and he understands the gravity of this
         and is worried by the prospect of having to return to Jamaica.'

20. By way a letter dated 24 March 2019, the appellant's former local
   authority personal advisor, Ms. Szolene Lowe, detailed the circumstances
   leading to the appellant being placed in care. She observed, inter alia:


         'Nonetheless by the age of 16 [the appellant] had already
         experienced family breakdown, death of a parent, isolation,
         abandonment, disturbed sleep patterns, identity issues and loss of
         housing stability, and as a result was left exposed to become a
         victim of child exploitation by older individual(s) in his peer
         group. By March 2016, [the appellant's] foster placement had broken
         down and [he] was placed in ... a semi-independent living
         placement. These periods in [the appellant's] life were
         particularly challenging and sadly mirror him engaging in
         criminality. This led to [the appellant] receiving two drug related
         convictions.'

21. Ms. Lowe further observes a manager at the semi-independent living
   placement describing the appellant as:

         '... 'charismatic', 'charming' and confirmed he enjoys 'making
         other laugh whilst socialising'. [The appellant] developed his
         independent living skills further and has learned how to budget his
         finances appropriately.'

22. A social worker, Cady Morrison, detailed by a letter dated 24 April
   2019:

         'During the time that I worked with [the appellant] I found him to
         be a polite, respectful and reflective young man who struggled with
         feeling isolated and rejected by his family both in the UK and his
         country of origin. Whilst he had made some poor choices with
         regards to criminal activity, out of the many people I have worked
         with [the appellant] was one of the most vulnerable and emotionally
         fragile. He struggled hugely with abandonment from his father and
         isolation from his family, further exacerbated by his feelings of
         helplessness with regards to his situation and struggling to be
         able to separate himself from his criminal affiliations who are
         known to prey and groom vulnerable and isolated young people. He
         often would become tearful and distressed when discussing his
         situation and was able to express regret and insight.'

23. I confirm that I have also considered written evidence from Tanesia
   Williams, Jacqueline Banton, Raimar Banton, Maria Rollins, Shandon
   Aubrey, Dawn Cudjoe, Naiha Ali, Gabrielle Hibbert, Delroy Latty, Ricky
   Gardner, Ian Buckingham and Sheresa Millington.

Decision

Vulnerability

24. I was asked by Ms. Sanders to treat the appellant as a vulnerable
   witness. Mr. Melvin opposed the application. Reliance was placed by the
   appellant upon a psychological assessment conducted by Dr Neil Egnal,
   consultant clinical psychologist and clinical neuropsychologist,
   following an interview. The report is dated 28 April 2019 and Dr Egnal
   opines that the appellant has moderate PTSD and appears to be severely
   depressed occasioned by childhood experiences in Jamaica and in this
   country. The appellant is further identified as being of low average
   intelligence, to have memory and concentration difficulties and to have
   visuo-motor difficulties. The respondent did not challenge the medical
   diagnosis. I further accept that the appellant is dyslexic and observe
   the Equal Treatment Bench Book (March 2020), at pgs 306-309. I accept
   that the appellant's various conditions impact upon his ability to
   present his case in a court setting. Consequently, I make it clear than
   in considering the appellant's evidence I have had regard to the 'Joint
   Presidential Guidance Note No. 2 of 2010: Child, Vulnerable Adult and
   Sensitive Appellant Guidance' and my assessment of his evidence has been
   considered in the round, taking due account of the medical evidence.


Credibility

25. The decision of Immigration Judge Wellesley-Cole, dated 24 February
   2011, concerning the appellant's entry clearance appeal, confirms that
   evidence was filed as to the appellant's mother dying when he was aged 15
   months and further confirming that he resided with his mother's sister,
   and her three children, whilst in Jamaica. It was found that the
   appellant's father had not abrogated parental responsibility and he
   remitted money to Jamaica for the appellant.

26. The appellant's personal history is, on any assessment, a sad one with
   significant, adverse personal experiences. Much of his history as to his
   life in Jamaica and in this country, including the circumstances in which
   he was place in care when aged 15 and his subsequent criminal activity,
   is corroborated by reliable evidence. I am satisfied to the requisite
   standard, namely the balance of probabilities, that such personal
   experiences resulted in the appellant being, in his late youth and early
   adulthood, a vulnerable and isolated person who was targeted and groomed
   by older persons involved in criminal activity.

27. The evidence presented by means of the entry clearance application was
   that the appellant had limited family in Jamaica, and I am satisfied to
   the requisite standard that as a young child living in care in this
   country the limited contact he enjoyed with family members in Jamaica has
   been all but extinguished since he commenced residing in this country. I
   accept that the appellant's limited contact with one male relative via
   Facebook has not resumed from the time of his incarceration. There may be
   many reasons as to why his relative broke off contact, but I accept that
   the appellant has been unsuccessful in resuming contact. I therefore find
   that the appellant will enjoy no familial support on return to Jamaica.

28. I further accept that the witnesses who gave evidence supporting the
   appellant provided honest and measured evidence on his behalf. Such
   evidence was not challenged by Mr. Melvin. I find that the appellant,
   identified as being vulnerable and emotionally fragile, is developing
   maturity, in part due to the impending birth of his child. He has secured
   personal strength, and developed skills in avoiding his criminal peers,
   consequent to his relocation away from his former home area and the
   strength he finds in his relationship with LJ, in particular as he taken
   steps in his preparation for parenthood. I accept that he is remorseful
   as to his criminal behaviour, and has sufficient insight to understand
   the impact his vulnerability had in his being targeted and groomed by
   criminals.

29. I further find that the appellant is pro-social and is taking positive
   steps to avoid further criminal offending. He has developed around
   himself a network of friends and professionals to aid him as he grows in
   independence and maturity and has proven willing to rely upon this
   support network.

Article 3

30. Ms. Sanders advanced the contention that the appellant would be at risk
   of his article 3 rights being breached upon his return to Jamaica. The
   Tribunal had, it proved erroneously, understood from Ms. Sander's
   skeleton argument that the appellant was contending that he would be at
   risk of sex trafficking on return to Jamaica. The Tribunal was helpfully
   informed that this was not a risk being advanced.

31. The appellant contends that his return to Jamaica would be in
   circumstances where he would suffer deprivation that meets the test of
   very exceptional circumstances. Reliance is placed upon his medical
   diagnosis, vulnerability and that he has no-one to look after him in
   Jamaica.

32. It is well-established that the responsibility of a State will be
   engaged under the ECHR where substantial grounds are shown for believing,
   for example in a deportation case, that the person concerned, if
   deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman
   or degrading treatment or punishment in the country of return. In so far
   as any liability under the ECHR is or may be incurred, it is liability
   incurred by the contracting State that is seeking to deport by reason of
   its having taken action which as a direct consequence exposes an
   individual to proscribed ill-treatment: Soering v. United Kingdom (1989)
   11 EHRR 439, at [96]. The Strasbourg court has confirmed that there is no
   exception to the real risk test, even on national security grounds:
   Chahal v. United Kingdom (1997) 23 EHRR 413, at [79]-[82].

33. Ill-treatment has to reach a minimum level of severity to fall within
   the scope of article 3 and the question as to whether the minimum level
   has been reached in any given case will depend upon the facts, calling
   for an intensely fact-sensitive inquiry. In this matter, the inhuman
   treatment complained of is not directed to the appellant by the Jamaican
   authorities. Rather, it is said to be the absence of support from such
   authorities that will lead to homelessness and destitution. In Secretary
   of State for the Home Department v. Said [2016] EWCA CIv 442; [2016] Imm
   AR 5, Burnett LJ (as he then was) held, at [18]:

         'These cases demonstrate that to succeed in resisting removal on
         article 3 grounds on the basis of suggested poverty or deprivation
         on return which are not the responsibility of the receiving country
         or others in the sense described in para 282 of [Sufi & Elmi v
         United Kingdom (2012) 54 EHRR 9], whether or not the feared
         deprivation is contributed to by a medical condition, the person
         liable to deportation must show circumstances which bring him
         within the approach of the Strasbourg Court in the [D v United
         Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 423 and N v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR
         39] cases.'

34. There is no merit in the appellant's efforts to assert that he more
   readily satisfies the test of 'very exceptional circumstances' by the
   threshold of interference being lowered, because he was recently a child.
   He is an adult, aged 20, and does not possess the 'special vulnerability'
   enjoyed by children that impacts upon the scope of the obligation placed
   upon contracting states to protect children from breaches of article 3.
   There is no sliding scale for the protection of young adults in a manner
   akin to the special protection provided to children, either under the
   ECHR or in international law generally, and so he cannot lawfully assert
   that the proportionality assessment as to the interference in his
   protected rights is accordingly amended.

35. Reliance is placed upon a generic report authored by Luke de Noronha,
   who at the time of authoring the report was in the third year of his
   DPhil in anthropology studies at the University of Oxford. The report is
   undated, and its contents strongly suggest that it was written soon after
   Mr. de Noronha's return from Jamaica in November 2016. Whilst Mr de
   Noronha may have an ever-developing experience and knowledge as to the
   return of persons to Jamaica, in his report he provides no detail as to
   his qualifications or his expertise to address mental health and housing
   provision in Jamaica. His source material for his report is limited, and
   he provides limited information as to the 'many people' he spoke to when
   compiling the report. Being mindful of the approach adopted to expert
   evidence by the Supreme Court in Kennedy v. Cordia (Services) LLP [2016]
   UKSC 6; [2016] 1 W.L.R. 597, at [38]-[61], I do not accept on the basis
   of this report alone, without more, that Mr de Noronha is an expert on
   issues of mental health care services, housing provision and destitution
   in Jamaica. Consequent to my concerns as to the substance of this generic
   report, I place limited weight upon it.

36. Beyond Mr de Noronha's report, Ms. Sanders relies upon objective
   material identified at paragraphs 22 and 23 of her skeleton argument,
   consisting of: Jamaican and British newspaper articles addressing
   poverty, mental illness and crime in Jamaica; a paragraph from the US
   State Department's 'Trafficking in Persons Report 2019 - Jamaica'; and a
   general assessment as to crime figures in Jamaica contained within OSAC's
   'Jamaica 2019 Crime & Safety Report'. Having read these documents with
   care, even when taken cumulatively and at their highest, they come
   nowhere close to meeting the requisite article 3 threshold. The
   appellant's appeal on article 3 grounds is therefore dismissed.

Article 8

37. Section 117A-D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
   ('the 2002 Acct') and paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A of the Rules detail
   the requirements that are to be considered when considering article 8
   rights. Section 117C is a statutory provision specifically addressing the
   article 8 rights of persons liable to deportation as foreign national
   offenders. The Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) v. Secretary of State for
   the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 663; [2017] 1 WLR 207 confirmed that
   the Rules provide clear guidance regarding article 8 rights and
   deportation. Foreign criminals are divided into two categories: those
   with sentences of between one year and four years imprisonment (medium
   offenders) and those sentenced to four years or more (serious offenders).
   'Safety nets' provide for possible escape from deportation for medium
   offenders, including parent/partner provisions under paragraph 399 and
   long-term residency under paragraph 399A. Otherwise, there have to be
   'very compelling circumstances' under paragraph 398. The appellant is for
   the purpose of the deportation regime classified as a medium offender.

38. The Rules in this context do not amount to complete code but they
   remain a relevant and vitally important consideration. The Supreme Court
   held in Hesham Ali v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]
   UKSC 60; [2016] 1 WLR 4799 that paragraphs 399 and 399A do not alone
   govern appellate decision-making as to the balance between the public
   interest in deporting foreign criminals and the criminals' rights under
   article 8. It remains for the Tribunal to judge whether the factors
   weighing against the public interest lead to the conclusion that
   deportation would be disproportionate. The respondent's policies are an
   important consideration because they represent the minister's assessment
   of the general public interest. However, the Rules are not a lens and do
   not alone govern appellate decision-making. They remain a relevant and
   important consideration but are not law. The Tribunal is to conduct its
   own assessment and judge whether the countervailing factors lead to the
   conclusion that deportation would be disproportionate. The respondent's
   assessment is not to be disregarded. The critical issue is, generally,
   whether giving due weight to the public interest the article 8 claim is
   sufficiently strong to outweigh it.

39. The appellant asserts that his personal circumstances concerning his
   article 8 private life rights are such that very compelling circumstances
   arise outweighing the public interest in his deportation. The Court of
   Appeal confirmed in NA (Pakistan) that the very compelling circumstances
   exception established by paragraph 398 of the Rules is also to be read
   into section 117C(3) of the 2002 Act.

40. In Hesham Ali v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC
   60; [2016] 1 W.L.R. 4799, at [47]-[50] the Supreme Court endorsed a
   structured approach to proportionality. The critical issue for the
   Tribunal is generally whether, giving due weight to the strength of the
   public interest in the deportation of the offender in the case before it,
   the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In considering
   as to whether very compelling circumstances exist, this Tribunal is to
   have regard to the totality of the evidence: Assad v. Secretary of State
   for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 10.

41. As to the appellant's private life I initially consider the private
   life exception established by section 117C(4) of the 2002 act and
   paragraph 399A of the Rules: a) the offender has been 'lawfully resident'
   in the United Kingdom for most of their life, b) they are 'socially and
   culturally integrated' into United Kingdom society and c) there would be
   'very significant obstacles' to integration in the society of the
   proposed country of removal. The elements are conjunctive and so all
   three must be satisfied before this exception can be relied upon. Ms.
   Sanders appropriately accepted that the appellant cannot satisfy (a) as
   he has lawfully resided in this country for a period just shy of half of
   his life. Secretary of State for the Home Department v. SC (Jamaica)
   [2017] EWCA Civ 2112; [2018] 1 W.L.R. 4004.

42. As to 'social and cultural integration', I observe that the appellant
   has resided away from Jamaica since the age of 11 and has enjoyed limited
   connection to the Jamaican community in this country since he was placed
   in care at the age of 15. I find, on balance, that the appellant is
   truthful as to considering the United Kingdom to be his home and that he
   has limited personal connection with Jamaica, including its culture. It
   is clearly apparent that his pro-social friendships, and his life with
   LJ, are rooted in this country. The Court of Appeal recently confirmed in
   CI (Nigeria) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA
   Civ 2027, at [58]:

         '... a person's social identity is not defined solely by such
         particular relationships but is constituted at a deep level by
         familiarity with and participation in the shared customs,
         traditions, practices, beliefs, values, linguistic idioms and other
         local knowledge which situate a person in a society or social group
         and generate a sense of belonging. The importance of upbringing and
         education in the formation of a person's social identity is well
         recognised, and its importance in the context of cases involving
         the article 8 rights of persons facing expulsion because of
         criminal offending has been recognised by the European Court. Thus,
         in the Uner case at para 58, the court considered it 'self-evident'
         that, in assessing the strength of a foreign national's ties with
         the 'host' country in which they are living, regard is to be had to
         "the special situation of aliens who have spent most, if not all,
         of their childhood in the host country, were brought up there and
         received their education there.'

43. Having considered the evidence of the appellant and his witnesses with
   care, I do not find that he is alienated from British society. His social
   and cultural identity have primarily been formed in this country.
   Children aged 11 and above, attending secondary school in this country,
   make rapid strides in their integration within their local community,
   developing a myriad of social interactions outside of the family home.
   The appellant's links with this country developed greater depth when
   living in care and therefore residing away from his Jamaican family
   household. His offending was primarily committed between the ages of 17
   and 18. I have found that his criminal behaviour was rooted in his having
   been groomed by older criminals who exploited his vulnerability. He has
   mental health problems but does not suffer from addiction and he is not
   socially isolated. I have found that he possesses a growing maturity, in
   part aided by his moving into accommodation encouraging greater
   independence, but also consequent to his developing relationship with LJ
   and his preparations for fatherhood. Since his release from prison, and
   his move away from his criminal peers, the appellant has been pro-social.
   I find that in the circumstances of this matter the integrative links
   established by the appellant through living here were not severed by his
   offending and imprisonment to such extent that he was no longer socially
   and culturally integrated in this country.

44. As for the third limb of the exception established by section 117C(4)
   of the 2002 Act and paragraph 399A of the Rules I have found that the
   appellant has no connection with any family residing in Jamaica and would
   return to the country enjoying no familial support. The appellant is
   presently a 'former relevant child', supported by a local authority, with
   very limited, if any, contact with his wider family in this country. It
   is self-evident that he would have no financial support upon his return
   to Jamaica and no immediate means of securing accommodation. He has been
   diagnosed with low average intelligence. He possesses memory and
   concentration difficulties and has visuo-motor difficulties. Whilst these
   do not preclude the ability to eventually secure employment, likely to be
   of a low-paid nature, I am satisfied that they will initially, and
   significantly, impede his ability to secure employment and accommodation
   for a time after his return to Jamaica. He will return in circumstances
   where he does not have familial support and having left Jamaica at the
   age of 11 is not enough of an insider in terms of understanding how life
   in Jamaican society is carried on, and lacks capacity to participate in
   it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be
   able to operate on a day-to-day basis in that society and to build up
   within a reasonable time a variety of human relationships to give
   substance to his private life: Secretary of State for the Home Department
   v. Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 81

45. In the circumstances arising in this appeal I find that there would be
   significant obstacles to the appellant's integration on his return to
   Jamaica.

46. These findings are carried forward into my assessment as to whether
   very compelling circumstances exist so as to outweigh the public interest
   in the appellant's deportation. However, these findings are not
   determinative, merely a part of the balance sheet assessment I am
   required to undertake, as the question to be answered by this Tribunal is
   whether there are very compelling circumstances 'over and above' the
   statutory Exceptions to the public interest in deportation.

47. As to 'very compelling circumstances', Nicol J held in Chege (section
   117D: Article 8: approach) [2015] UKUT 165 (IAC); [2016] Imm AR 833 that
   'compelling' as an adjective means having a powerful and irresistible
   effect and the annexing of the word 'very' indicates the very high
   threshold that has to be passed to meet this requirement of the Rules.

48. I observe the importance of not overlooking that the primary
   responsibility for the public interest vests in the respondent, see
   Wilson LJ in OH (Serbia) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department
   [2008] EWCA Civ 694; [2009] I.N.L.R. 109, at [15(d)], and to similar
   effect the observations of Maurice Kay LJ, at [29]. I am very mindful
   that the public interest in the deportation of criminals is not merely to
   protect against the risk of further offending; it is also to deter others
   and to ensure that the public maintain confidence in the effective
   treatment of foreign criminals.

49. I place significant weight on the appellant's criminal offending and
   also as to the public interest in deportation being, in part, a
   deterrence against foreign national offenders conducting criminal
   activity in this country. However, it is appropriate to observe that in
   this matter such offending was mainly within a relatively short period,
   some of which was whilst the appellant was a minor. Weight can
   appropriately be placed upon the appellant, a vulnerable, emotionally
   fragile and isolated adolescent, having been groomed by elder, criminal
   peers, but this is not determinative of the question to be answered by
   the Tribunal nor does it enjoy significant weight. I note that the
   appellant has been subject to two custodial terms: a 12-month detention
   and training order and 28 days for contempt of court.

50. The words 'circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions
   1 and 2', which are used in section 117C(6) and which the Court of Appeal
   in NA (Pakistan) held are to be read into section 117C(3), do not prevent
   a person facing deportation from relying on matters falling within the
   scope of the Exceptions to establish 'very compelling circumstances' at
   the second stage of the analysis: JZ (Zambia) v Secretary of State for
   the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 116, at [28]-[30]. Nor is a person
   facing deportation denied the ability to establish very compelling
   circumstances because he cannot meet one or both of the Exceptions:
   Chege, at [27]-[28]

51. As recently confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Akinyemi v. Secretary
   of State for the Home Department (No. 2) [2019] EWCA Civ 2098 Part 5A of
   the 2002 Act reinforces the policy statement found in the Immigration
   Rules and set the intended balance of relevant factors in direct
   statutory form. However, it is consistent with the Strasbourg
   jurisprudence that the strength of the public interest is not fixed but
   is capable of being reduced by factors in the individual case. The object
   of Part 5A of the 2002 Act is through a structured approach to produce a
   final result that is compatible with article 8. To ensure that this is
   achieved, it is necessary when considering whether circumstances are
   sufficiently compelling to outweigh the public interest in the
   deportation of a 'foreign criminal' to take into account the
   jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, including the
   important decision of Maslov v. Austria (application no. 1638/03) [2009]
   INLR 47, at [71]-[74]:

         '71.  In a case like the present one, where the person to be
         expelled is a young adult who has not yet founded a family of his
         own, the relevant criteria are


             -  the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the
             applicant;


             -  the length of the applicant's stay in the country from
             which he or she is to be expelled;


             -  the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the
             applicant's conduct during that period; and


             -  the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the
             host country and with the country of destination.


         72.  The Court would also clarify that the age of the person
         concerned can play a role when applying some of the above criteria.
         For instance, when assessing the nature and seriousness of the
         offences committed by an applicant, it has to be taken into account
         whether he or she committed them as a juvenile or as an adult (see,
         for instance, Moustaquim v. Belgium, 18 February 1991, � 44, Series
         A no. 193, and Radovanovic v. Austria, no. 42703/98, � 35, 22 April
         2004).


         73.  In turn, when assessing the length of the applicant's stay in
         the country from which he or she is to be expelled and the solidity
         of the social, cultural and family ties with the host country, it
         evidently makes a difference whether the person concerned had
         already come to the country during his or her childhood or youth,
         or was even born there, or whether he or she only came as an adult.
         This tendency is also reflected in various Council of Europe
         instruments, in particular in Committee of Ministers
         Recommendations Rec(2000)15 and Rec(2002)4 (see paragraphs 34-35
         above).


         74. Although Article 8 provides no absolute protection against
         expulsion for any category of aliens (see �ner, cited above, � 55),
         including those who were born in the host country or moved there in
         their early childhood, the Court has already found that regard is
         to be had to the special situation of aliens who have spent most,
         if not all, of their childhood in the host country, were brought up
         there and received their education there (see �ner, � 58 in fine).'

52. The appellant enjoyed settled status in this country from June 2010 and
   so satisfies the 'lawful residence' requirement to engage the statement
   of general principles in Maslov: DM (Zimbabwe) v. Secretary of State for
   the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 1288; [2016] 1 W.L.R. 2108. The
   reference to the general principles applying to persons who enjoyed
   settled status for most of their childhood, as detailed by the Strasbourg
   Court in Maslov, at [75], is not to be read as legislative text. It
   identifies a conventional balancing exercise with no bright line as to
   length of lawful residence: CI (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the
   Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2027, at [111]-[114].

53. Though serious enough to attract a custodial sentence, the most
   significant sentence imposed by the criminal courts is at the lowest
   level that automatically leads to deportation. In this matter deportation
   is sought on conducive to the public good grounds and there is a
   significant public interest in foreign national offenders being deported.
   However, I am satisfied that though the appellant committed the offences,
   and was correctly convicted, as to the majority of them he was groomed by
   persons who identified and manipulated his vulnerability. I observe the
   contempt of court conviction, which arose in particular circumstances.
   This conviction was clearly correct, but the custodial sentence imposed
   is at the lower end of the permitted scale for a custodial sentence
   concerning a young offender: section 108(1) Powers of Criminal Courts
   (Sentencing) Act 2000.

54. I am satisfied that the experiences addressed in the evidence filed
   with this court as to events in Jamaica and, in particular, events
   arising after his entry into this country combined to leave the appellant
   as a vulnerable, isolated and emotionally fragile adolescent who was
   targeted by criminal exploiters. He is now pro-social, surrounded by a
   professional and personal safety net that has enabled him to move away
   from his criminal peers. He is socially and culturally integrated into
   this country and I have found that he would experience significant
   obstacles to his integration on his return to Jamaica. I further find
   that he has spent his formative years in this country, lawfully resident
   throughout such time, and having left Jamaica as a child he has lost
   contact with that country. I have found that there is solidity in his
   social and cultural ties to this country, and he will soon have family
   ties with LJ, a British citizen, and their child. I accept that he
   considers himself to be British with Jamaican heritage. His is a special
   situation as identified by the Strasbourg court in Maslov. The Supreme
   Court confirmed in Hesham Ali that the correct approach to that balancing
   exercise is to recognise that the public interest in the deportation of
   foreign criminals is a flexible one, and that there will be a small
   number of cases where individual circumstances reduce the legitimate and
   strong public interest in removal. I find for the reasons detailed above
   that the instant case is such a case.

55. I note the apt observation of Mr. Bramble, the Senior Presenting
   Officer who represented the respondent at the error of law hearing, that
   the appellant may well have a meritorious appeal under article 8.
   Consideration of the evidence presented in this matter, including the
   appellant's personal history and the predatory exploitation of his
   vulnerabilities by criminal elders, leads to there being only one
   reasonable conclusion, namely that very compelling circumstances arise
   outweighing the public interest in the appellant's deportation.

56. I allow the appeal on article 8 grounds.
