                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant, an ethnic  Albanian  citizen  of  Federal  Republic  of
      Yugoslavia from Kosovo, appeals with leave  of  the  Tribunal  (Mr  AR
      Mackey, Vice President) against the determination  of  an  Adjudicator
      (Mrs I A M Murray) dismissing his appeal on asylum  and  human  rights
      grounds against the decision of the respondent on  14  March  2001  to
      refuse to grant asylum.  Before us the appellant was represented by Mr
      M  Quayum  of  Camden  Community  Law  Centre.   The  respondent   was
      represented by Mr M Blundell.

   2. The appellant was born on 28 September 1983.  At the date of  decision
      he was under 18 years  old.   The  notice  refusing  to  grant  asylum
      states:

      "It  has  been  decided,  however,  that  because  of  the  particular
      circumstances of your case, you should be granted exceptional leave to
      remain in the United Kingdom.  The Secretary of State therefore grants
      you leave to remain until 28/09/2001."


   3. The appeal to the Adjudicator accordingly lay under Section  69(3)  of
      the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  In dealing with the question  of
      the grant of exceptional leave, the Adjudicator said at  paragraph  18
      of the determination:

      "The appellant has been granted ELR until his 18th birthday.   I  have
      read the objective evidence regarding this and I  note  that  it  does
      refer to four years ELR, however,   I  have  adjudicated  in  quite  a
      number of cases like this one where a young appellant has been granted
      ELR until his 18th birthday and this does appear to  be  a  reasonably
      standard policy of the Home Office.  The reason  that  this  appellant
      was granted ELR at all was because of his age.  The appellant  is  now
      going to be an adult on return to Kosovo.  I have carefully  read  all
      of the objective evidence on returning young  people  to  Kosovo  and,
      indeed, returning young people anywhere from the United Kingdom.   The
      appellant will not be under 18 when he is returned and there is a  big
      regeneration programme going on in Kosovo... I do consider that  there
      is sufficiency of protection in Kosovo even for  somebody  young  like
      the appellant because of the presence of KFOR and UNMIK."


   4. In granting leave to appeal Mr Mackey said that the grounds:

      "Also raise the issue of failure to give reasons  in  respect  of  ELR
      granted to this applicant who was a  minor  when  he  arrived  in  the
      United Kingdom.  The asylum and human  rights  points  raised  in  the
      grounds of appeal do not appear to be the basis of an arguable appeal.
       However, the Home Office policy point  in  relation  to  ELR  may  be
      arguable.  Leave is granted on this ground only."


   5. We invited Mr Quayum to indicate on what  basis  we  could  allow  the
      appeal.  Mr Quayum suggested that we could do so on the basis that the
      respondent had departed from his published policy and so his  decision
      was not in accordance with the law.  Mr Quayum submitted that  if  the
      respondent does not grant 4 years exceptional leave to  remain  to  an
      individual he must give reasons for his decision.   Mr  Quayum  agreed
      that he was unable to produce any published policy  about  exceptional
      leave to remain and minors.

   6. We are unanimously of opinion that there is no basis upon  which  this
      appeal can succeed.  In our judgement the question of whether, and  if
      so for how long, to grant exceptional leave to remain  to  any  asylum
      claimant is entirely a matter for the Secretary  of  State.   In  this
      case he decided  to  grant  the  appellant,  who  was  then  a  minor,
      exceptional leave to remain until he attained his majority at the  age
      of 18 years.  Mr Quayum has been unable to put before us any published
      policy which would suggest that  this  was  a  departure  from  normal
      practice.  Indeed,  our  own  experience  accords  with  that  of  the
      Adjudicator.  We are quite clear that the  respondent  was  acting  in
      accordance with the law  when  he  decided  to  grant  this  appellant
      exceptional leave to remain until his 18th birthday.

   7. The appeal is dismissed.
