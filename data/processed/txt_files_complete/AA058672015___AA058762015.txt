For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In reviewing the issues to be determined in this appeal further  to  my
    error of law decision promulgated 4 September 2018, it became  apparent
    that there will need to be a sufficiently wide range of fact-finding in
    the remaking of the decision and, accordingly, the parties agreed  that
    the appropriate course in accordance with the  Practice  Statements  is
    for the case to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for the decision
    to be remade.


 2. By way of summary therefore the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
    set aside for reasons set out in the error of law decision referred  to
    above.  The appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
    remaking of the decision.





Signed                                  Date 9 November 2018
