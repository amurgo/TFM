                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Peter Herbert OBE), sitting  at  Hendon  on  16  August
    2017, to  a deportation appeal by a citizen of Colombia, born  31  July
    1981. The appellant had been here since 2005 on a residence card as the
    wife of an Italian citizen, with a gap from 2010 - 11, as her husband's
    own residence had been broken by  his  detention  from  2006  -  10  in
    Ecuador. In March - April 2015 she  had  been  involved,  in  what  the
    sentencing judge was prepared to accept was a 'lesser r�le'  under  the
    guidelines, in a conspiracy to supply 1 kg of cocaine, which at 70%  he
    described as 'import purity', and following her conviction by the jury,
    on 10 December was sentenced to five years' imprisonment.


    That is enough to show that the appellant was extremely  lucky  in  the
    judge's decision; but it was not one  which  was  or  could  have  been
    challenged as one which no reasonable judge  could  have  made  on  the
    basis he did. This was that, in terms of the principles set out in  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016, at reg. 27  (5),
    she no longer presented a 'genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat' to justify her deportation. Obviously in  a  non-EEA  case  she
    would have needed to satisfy the requirements of s.  117C  (6)  of  the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002;  but  there  is  the
    difference.


    The judge's decision was challenged in the First-tier Tribunal  on  the
    basis of an authority which, as the permission judge pointed  out,  did
    not deal with the grounds on which the judge had reached his conclusion
    in this case. Permission was granted in the Upper  Tribunal,  and  time
    extended by one day, on the basis  of  grounds  complaining  about  the
    judge's description of the view  reached  in  the  Offender  Assessment
    System [OASys] assessment (13 April 2017) on which he relied  as  being
    that of the respondent's own expert.


    This was of course  now  incorrect,  as  responsibility  for  'offender
    management', as probation  and  prison  services  are  now  known,  was
    transferred some years ago from the Home  Office  to  the  Ministry  of
    Justice. However, as Mr Tufan realistically agreed, the  administrative
    location of the authority responsible for the OASys  report  could  not
    have any material effect on the expertise, or otherwise of  the  person
    who drafted it. The appeal before us must stand  or  fall  on  how  the
    judge dealt with the case, including the report,  on  its  merits;  and
    this was the only ground on which permission was granted.


    No doubt with that in mind, Mr Tufan, who no-one could have accused  of
    lack of industry in his own dealings with this case, had come  prepared
    with several authorities which appeared  to  raise  additional  points.
    Notice of hearing had been given for today on  21  December,  with  the
    standard directions. Though those may be more appropriate to the  usual
    case of an appellant's onward appeal, both parties should be well aware
    that the case which the other side will come prepared to deal  with  is
    the one on which permission has been granted.


    In this case, no notice of any additional grounds had been  given,  and
    there was no draft of any before us.  When  we  went  into  Mr  Tufan's
    additional points with him, the case he wanted to make turned out to be
    that the judge had been wrong to deal with the OASys report as  he  did
    at 69, on the basis that  the  evidence  before  him  showed  that  the
    appellant was "... fully remorseful and has dealt successfully with her
    offending behaviour to the extent that her risk of reoffending  is  now
    as low as between 3% and 5% ..." (as assessed at p 34).


    The basis on which Mr Tufan proposed to make this point was taken  from
    paragraph 2.14 (at p 11) of the OASys report: the police had  seized  a
    very large sum of money (apparently over �160,000), found in bundles at
    her home address, whose presence there she had been unable to  explain.
    She also continued to deny responsibility for the offence, giving  (see
    2.11) a quite different account, which the jury had clearly refused  to
    accept, of how she  had  come  to  the  house  where  the  cocaine  was
    delivered.








    The author of the report had taken  this  into  account  at  2.14,  but
    concluded "However, given the nature of her offence, and  the  lack  of
    any  previous  convictions  suggesting  any  escalation  in   offending
    behaviour, I would not consider [the appellant] to  pose  any  risk  of
    serious harm. While the appellant's denial  of  responsibility  at  the
    date of her trial  was  of  course  clear,  there  is  nothing  in  the
    sentencing judge's remarks about any money  found  at  her  house,  and
    there is nothing to suggest that this passage in the report  was  drawn
    to the judge's attention. He was of course free to accept or reject the
    writer's conclusions, and, if he had accepted them on  a  wrong  basis,
    then his decision would have been open to challenge.


    However, Mr Nathan, who, unlike Mr Tufan,  appeared  before  the  judge
    pointed out two things: first, there was evidence in her own  statement
    and those of her family members that by the date of the  hearing  (four
    months after the OASys assessment) the appellant had changed  her  mind
    and repented of her crime. Second, the presenting officer had  declined
    to cross-examine her, or the other witnesses. Mr Nathan suggested  that
    the judge had been entitled to accept this evidence, as  he  apparently
    did at 69, together with the very good reports on her from  the  prison
    authorities, to which he refers at 58 - 61.


    While the appellant, and her witnesses, could reasonably have  expected
    to face vigorous cross-examination  on  her  rather  recent  change  of
    heart, the judge was also entitled to expect that to happen, if it were
    to be challenged. That is the stage at which Mr  Tufan's  point  should
    have been taken. While it is a perfectly valid and serious one, it  was
    neither raised in the grounds of appeal before us, nor any notice of it
    given to those representing the appellant. Bearing  in  mind  both  the
    overriding objective to deal with cases  fairly  and  justly,  and  the
    parties' obligation to

       (a) help the Upper Tribunal to further the overriding objective; and

       (b) co-operate with the Upper Tribunal generally.


    we declined to allow the necessary (undrafted) amendment


    Since, as Mr Tufan accepted, the grounds of appeal as they stand raised
    no arguable error of law on the part of the judge, the result  is  that
    this appeal is dismissed. We hope that  the  appellant  will  take  due
    warning from what has happened, because it is quite inconceivable  that
    she could be so lucky again.
