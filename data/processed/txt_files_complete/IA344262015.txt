Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms E Ikiriko, Solicitor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Wylie allowing the Appellant's appeal on  the  basis  of
    his human rights in relation to his refused application for  indefinite
    leave to  remain  having  completed  the  requisite  period  of  lawful
    residence.

 2. For ease of  comprehension  I  will  refer  to  the  parties  by  their
    designation before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The Secretary of State  was  granted  permission  to  appeal  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Gleeson.  The grounds upon which permission was  granted
    may be summarised as follows:

         "2.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge found as  a  fact  that  it  was
             likely that in January 2013, when he took  his  test,  despite
             Project Faï¿½ade  evidence  that  70%  of  the  tests  taken  at
             Queensbury College on the same day were invalid, the applicant
             had discharged the  burden  of  showing  that  a  satisfactory
             explanation and had not used deception.  However,  instead  of
             allowing the appeal under the Rules,  the  Judge  went  on  to
             allow it on human rights grounds only and to make no  decision
             at all under the Rules.

         3.   The Secretary of State challenges that decision on  the  basis
             that it is perverse, that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed
             properly to apply the decided cases in relation  to  ETS/TOEIC
             deception, and in particular, the  guidance  at  [57]  in  the
             decision of Mr Justice McCloskey in MA (Nigeria)  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2016] UKUT 450  (IAC).   She
             also contends that the Judge's decision  provides  no,  or  no
             adequate, reasoning  regarding  compelling  circumstances  for
             allowing the appeal outside the Rules on human rights grounds.

         4.   The grounds of appeal are arguable."

 4. I was not provided  with  a  Rule  24  response  from  the  Appellant's
    solicitor, however I was addressed by her in oral submissions.

Error of Law

 5. At the close of the hearing I indicated that there was a material error
    in law in the  decision,  namely  in  relation  to  the  second  ground
    concerning the outcome of the appeal on a human rights basis, but  that
    my reasons for so finding would follow.  I shall now give  my  findings
    in relation to both grounds of appeal which are as follows.

 6. In relation to the first ground of appeal, as Mr Walker accepted and as
    observed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies when refusing  permission,
    the grounds - drafted by a Miss L Carroll - are similar to every appeal
    in relation to ETS/TOEIC claims, and I must say,  having  studied  them
    with great care to search for any merit, the first ground which relates
    to an ETS claim, is the very definition of generic and pro  forma.   In
    relation to the first  ground  I  can  see  no  merit  in  the  ground,
    primarily because no positive submission is made other than setting out
    the law in relation to the leading authorities concerning this genre of
    appeals.  The only submissions that could perhaps  be  germane  to  the
    appeal are allegations that the First-tier Tribunal has failed to  give
    adequate reasoning regarding the Appellant's qualifications  which  the
    judge notes at paragraph 20 of his  decision,  that  the  judge  placed
    weight on  the  Appellant's  ability  to  record  the  details  in  the
    examination process, and in relation to whether the Appellant took  the
    ETS test despite having an ability in English and not needing to do  so
    (as discussed in MA (Nigeria) although the grounds do not refer to it).



 7. Taking those  issues  in  turn,  in  terms  of  the  Appellant's  other
    qualifications at paragraph 20,  those  relate  to  his  qualifications
    which he  achieved  in  April  2012,  namely  his  degree  in  Business
    Management from 2008 to 2012 and also at paragraph 11  the  mention  of
    his having studied for an HND in Computer Studies from 2006 to 2008 and
    a BTEC also.  These were qualifications that the judge was entitled  to
    take into account as they had all been achieved prior to the date  upon
    which he allegedly cheated in his ETS/TOEIC test which was 7th  January
    2012 and 15th January 2013, thus this was evidence that the  judge  was
    entitled to take into account.

 8. In relation to the second point regarding the  Appellant's  ability  to
    recall details of the examination process and  centre,  the  submission
    that a DVD had been allegedly 'circulated' to  "every  hearing  centre"
    and therefore judges should  all  be  aware  of  the  methods  used  by
    candidates and that candidates apparently would know the details of the
    test centre even if not sitting the test themselves is not one that has
    any merit given that it was not shown that a DVD was provided to  Judge
    Wylie, nor is there any evidence  to  indicate  that  he  was  given  a
    circulated DVD, nor is it suggested that the Appellant would  have  had
    another individual sit the test for him other than the submission  made
    in closing that it may have been easier for him to get someone else  to
    do the test because he was 'short on time'.   That  submission  was  of
    course noted by the judge in his decision and was  obviously  known  to
    him when reaching his conclusion on  the  Appellant's  credibility  and
    whether he had or had not in  fact  sat  the  test.   Thus  whilst  the
    submission is an interesting one in that there could be evidence  which
    a judge may arguably have to discount (albeit due to  a  DVD  that  has
    been circulated and not served as evidence in the context of an  appeal
    which an appellant can know  of  and  respond  to),  it  has  not  been
    established that such evidence showing  that  the  evidence  should  be
    discounted was placed before the First-tier Tribunal  and  consequently
    there can be no error arising from not having considered such evidence.



 9. In relation to the third  and  final  issue  of  the  authority  of  MA
    (Nigeria) and sitting the  test,  this  issue  does  overlap  with  the
    second, however it is  clear  to  me  that  MA  (Nigeria)  was  a  very
    different case where the panel was quite unimpressed with the  evidence
    of the Appellant, whereas the First-tier Tribunal here was persuaded by
    the oral evidence  of  this  Appellant  overall  and  consequently  the
    finding that was made was not a perverse one or one that was  not  open
    to the judge to make in all the circumstances.

Re-making the Appeal

10. Turning to the second ground of appeal and  the  fact  that  the  judge
    allowed the appeal on human  rights  grounds  and  failed  to  identify
    compelling circumstances  to  justify  consideration  of  human  rights
    outside the Immigration Rules, I am quietly surprised that a submission
    of this nature is still being  made  in  light  of  the  Supreme  Court
    authorities  of  Hesham  Ali  and  Agyarko,  given  that  it  has  been
    established conclusively that if there is any lacunae in the Rules,  or
    any issue which is not covered by  them  in  a  comprehensive  fashion,
    consideration of any factors remaining must take place outside  of  the
    Rules, and the Tribunal must consider those  matters  applying  a  fair
    balance approach and determining the issue in terms of  proportionality
    of the outcome of the appealed decision.

11. Leaving that to one side for a moment, it is clear from Judge Gleeson's
    grant of permission that she noted that the appeal was allowed on human
    rights grounds and that no decision  was  taken  under  the  Rules.   I
    equally am struck by this issue,  even  though  it  is  not  a  pleaded
    ground, I do see it as a material error of law in the  outcome  of  the
    appeal and consequently for that reason I do  find  that  there  is  an
    error of law in respect of paragraphs 34 and 35 alone of the  decision,
    in  that  they  perform  an  assessment  of  the  appeal  outside   the
    Immigration Rules under Article 8.

12. In my view, any further consideration  of  the  appeal  in  respect  of
    Article 8 was not  warranted  given  that  the  judge  found  that  the
    Appellant met all of the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  for
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK.  That separate finding  is  clear
    from the preceding paragraphs of  the  decision  which  remain  intact.
    Thus, for the preserved reasons already given by Judge  Wylie,  I  find
    that given that this is an old format appeal prior  to  the  6th  April
    2015 changes - in that  it  is  an  appeal  which  could  theoretically
    succeed if the decision is not in accordance with the Immigration Rules
    - I find that the appeal should have been allowed on the basis that the
    Immigration Rules were not properly applied  and  that  the  discretion
    should not have been exercised against  the  Appellant  in  respect  of
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules. Consequently, no other issue
    being taken with the Appellant's application for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain, the appeal falls to succeed under the Rules alone.  There is no
    utility in going on to consider Article  8  and  that  portion  of  the
    decision is therefore set aside due to  it  being  an  unnecessary  and
    discrete addition.

Notice of Decision

13. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside solely in relation
    to paragraphs 34 to 35 and the appeal is allowed under the  Immigration
    Rules as indicated above.

15. No anonymity direction was requested and none is considered necessary.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I was not asked to make a fee award by the Appellant  and  given  that  none
was made by the First-tier Tribunal and I am merely  correcting  the  formal
outcome of the appeal to reflect the findings already made by  Judge  Wylie,
I see no reason to interfere with that decision and I  do  not  see  fit  to
make any fee award.
