                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal S J Clarke promulgated following a hearing on 20th August
    2013.

 2. The Appellant is a male citizen of Afghanistan born  1st  January  1984
    who arrived in the United Kingdom on 12th June 2009 and claimed asylum.
     He  thereafter  absconded  before  re-establishing  contact  with  the
    authorities in the United Kingdom, indicating that he wished to  pursue
    his asylum claim.

 3. The Appellant claimed to have a well-founded  fear  of  persecution  by
    reason of imputed political opinion, on the basis that  he  had  worked
    for a company delivering fuel to American forces in  Afghanistan.   The
    application for  asylum  was  refused  on  26th  April  2013,  and  the
    Respondent issued  a  Notice  of  Immigration  Decision  of  that  date
    indicating that it was proposed to remove the Appellant from the United
    Kingdom.

 4. The appeal was heard by the First-tier Tribunal (FTT)  on  20th  August
    2013, and dismissed on asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights
    grounds.

 5. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    At a hearing on 9th May 2014, after hearing representations  from  both
    parties, I set aside the decision  of  the  FTT  and  the  hearing  was
    adjourned for further evidence to be given, so that the decision  could
    be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.  No findings were preserved, save for
    the finding that the Appellant  is  a  national  of  Afghanistan.   The
    reasons for setting aside the FTT decision are contained in my decision
    dated 17th May 2014 which was promulgated on 22nd May 2014.

The Law

 6. The Appellant would be entitled to asylum if  he  is  recognised  as  a
    refugee, as defined in regulation 2 of the Refugee or Person of Need of
    International Protection (Qualification) Regulations 2006 as  a  person
    who falls within Article 1A of the 1951 Geneva Convention.  The onus is
    on him to prove that he has a well-founded fear of  persecution  for  a
    Convention  reason  (race,  religion,  nationality,  membership  of   a
    particular social group or political opinion) and  he  is  outside  his
    country of nationality and unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling  to
    avail himself of the protection of that country.

 7. If  not  entitled  to  asylum  the  Appellant  would  be  eligible  for
    humanitarian protection under paragraph 339C of the  Immigration  Rules
    if he establishes substantial grounds for  believing  that  if  removed
    from the United Kingdom, he would face a real risk of suffering serious
    harm, and is unable or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail  himself
    of the protection of the country of return.

 8. The Appellant has also claimed that his removal would breach Article  3
    of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights (the  1950  Convention)
    and it is for the Appellant to  establish  that  if  removed  from  the
    United Kingdom there is a real risk of contravention of the Appellant's
    right to freedom from torture or  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or
    punishment.

 9. The Appellant also relies upon Article 8 of the  1950  Convention.   He
    must therefore prove that he satisfies the requirements of Appendix  FM
    or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, or show that there  is  a
    good reason for Article 8 to  be  considered  outside  the  rules.   If
    Article 8 is considered outside the rules,  the  Appellant  must  prove
    that he has established  family  and/or  private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom, and that the Respondent's decision would have consequences  of
    such gravity as to engage the Article, and  the  Respondent  must  then
    show that the decision is lawful, necessary and proportionate.

10. The burden of proof is on the Appellant  and  can  be  described  as  a
    reasonable degree of likelihood, which is a  lower  standard  than  the
    normal civil standard of the balance of probabilities.  I must look  at
    the circumstances as at the date of hearing.

The Appellant's Claim

11. The Appellant's claim as initially presented to the Respondent  is  set
    out in letters from his representatives dated  5th  November  2012  and
    10th April 2013, his screening interview dated 28th January  2013,  and
    his substantive asylum interview dated 3rd April 2013.  His  claim  may
    be summarised as follows.

12. The Appellant lived in the province of Laghman.  His father  died  when
    the Appellant was young, fighting for the  Mujahedeen.   The  Appellant
    had three step-brothers and a step-sister.

13. In 2004 he started working for AMA as  a  driver,  delivering  fuel  to
    American army compounds in Afghanistan.

14. He experienced no difficulties until 6th November 2008 when  his  step-
    brother returned from the mosque,  where  the  Taliban  announced  that
    anyone working for the Americans would  be  killed.   His  step-brother
    attacked him as a result of this, so the Appellant left  his  home  and
    went to a friend's house.  He received  some  treatment  from  a  local
    doctor.

15. The next day he heard that the Taliban had killed his  mother  and  his
    step-brother had reported to the police, that it was the Appellant  who
    had killed his mother.

16. On 7th November 2008 the Appellant's friend arranged for the  Appellant
    to leave his home area, and leave Afghanistan.  He left on 7th November
    2008 and travelled  through  various  countries  including  Greece  and
    France before arriving in the United Kingdom  on  12th  June  2009  and
    claiming  asylum.   He  thereafter  failed  to   report   as   ordered,
    subsequently explaining that he feared being returned to Afghanistan.

17. The Appellant was engaged to be married in Afghanistan, and he  remains
    in contact with his fianc�e by telephone.

18. The Appellant fears the Taliban if returned to  Afghanistan,  and  also
    his step-brothers.  He said in interview (question 96) that  his  step-
    brothers had informed the police that he had killed his mother, so that
    he would be arrested by the authorities and imprisoned, and  then  when
    released his step-brothers would be able to harm him.

The Respondent's Decision

19. The detailed reasons for the Respondent's decision are  set  out  in  a
    letter dated 26th April 2013 which may be summarised as follows.

20. It was not accept that the Appellant was a national of  Afghanistan  as
    he had not submitted documentary evidence to  prove  his  identity  and
    only demonstrated a vague knowledge of Afghanistan.

21. It was not accepted that the Appellant had worked as a driver for  AMA.
    The Appellant had produced a contract of employment,  together  with  a
    letter from the owner of his company, and three photographs of  himself
    and the vehicle that he drove.  The Respondent noted that the  font  of
    the letterhead differed when the contract of  employment  was  compared
    with the letter, and that neither the contract nor  the  letter  proved
    that  the  Appellant  delivered  fuel  to  American   compounds.    The
    Respondent did not accept that the documents could be  relied  upon  to
    support the Appellant's claim, and  noted  that  when  interviewed  the
    Appellant had only been able to provide vague details as  to  where  he
    had delivered fuel.  It was therefore not accepted that he  worked  for
    AMA delivering fuel to American compounds.

22. The Respondent did not accept that the Appellant had been  attacked  by
    his step-brother.  It was noted that the Appellant claimed to have been
    delivering fuel to American compounds for four  years  prior  to  being
    attacked.  The Appellant when interviewed had stated that  his  village
    was controlled by the Taliban, and everyone had seen  him  driving  and
    knew he worked for a company delivering fuel to Americans.  It was  not
    considered credible that he would be attacked after four years.

23. The Appellant claimed that he had received substantial  injuries  as  a
    result of the attack yet had  been  able  to  walk  for  fifteen-twenty
    minutes to a friend's house.  This was not considered credible.  It was
    therefore not accepted that the Appellant's step-brother  had  attacked
    him as a result of the Appellant delivering fuel to American forces.

24. The Respondent contended that  the  Appellant  had  given  inconsistent
    dates as to when the attack took place, those dates being 6th  November
    2008 and 15th November  2008  (it  is  not  clear  why  the  Respondent
    referred to 15th November 2008 as this was not part of the  Appellant's
    case.  Further  representations  from  his  solicitors  at  A4  of  the
    Respondent's bundle referred to the date of  15th  August  2008,  which
    appears to be incorrect).  The Respondent did not  accept  the  Taliban
    had killed the Appellant's mother as claimed, nor that his step-brother
    had reported to the police that the Appellant had  killed  his  mother.
    This was due to inconsistencies in the Appellant's account.

25. The Respondent relied upon section 8  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004 as  the  Appellant  had  claimed
    asylum on 12th June 2009, and  then  absconded  and  failed  to  resume
    contact with the Respondent until 12th June 2012.  This had delayed the
    handling of his claim by three years.

26. In summary, the  Respondent  rejected  the  Appellant's  claim  in  its
    entirety.

27. The Respondent did not accept that the Appellant would be  at  risk  if
    returned to Afghanistan, and believed that he could return to his  home
    area.  In the alternative the Respondent believed  that  the  Appellant
    had a reasonable option of internal relocation to Kabul.

28. It was not accepted that the  Appellant  was  entitled  to  asylum,  or
    humanitarian protection, and it was not accepted that there would be  a
    breach of his human rights if returned to Afghanistan.

The Hearing

Preliminary Issues

29. I established that I had received  all  documentation  upon  which  the
    parties intended to rely, and that each party had served the other with
    any documentation upon which reliance was to be placed.

30. I had the documents that had been before the First-tier Tribunal, those
    being the Respondent's bundle with Annexes A-H, the Appellant's  bundle
    compromising 296 pages, and a skeleton argument.

31. An application had been made on behalf of  the  Appellant  pursuant  to
    rule 15(2A) of The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    seeking to admit into evidence the psychiatric report dated  17th  July
    2014 prepared by Dr Wootton.  The application was  made  on  the  basis
    that  when  the  appeal  was  heard  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    Appellant's solicitors were  not  aware  that  he  was  suffering  from
    depression and taking medication.

32. Mr Walker did not object to the application, which I granted.

33. Mr Walker produced the European Court of Human Rights decision H and  B
    v The UK  70073/10  and  44539/11  upon  which  he  intended  to  rely.



34. Mr Alexander confirmed that the Appellant claimed asylum on  the  basis
    of his imputed political opinion, and claimed  humanitarian  protection
    in the alternative.  It was also confirmed that the Appellant wished to
    rely upon Articles 3 and 8 of the 1950 Convention, and it was  accepted
    that the Appellant could not satisfy the requirements  of  Appendix  FM
    and paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

35. Both representatives indicated that they  were  ready  to  proceed  and
    there was no application for an adjournment.

The Appellant's Evidence

36. There was no difficulty in communication between the Appellant and  the
    interpreter in Pashto.  The  Appellant  adopted  as  his  evidence  his
    witness statement dated 12th August 2013.  He was not asked any further
    questions by Mr Alexander.

37. The Appellant's witness statement may be summarised  as  follows.   The
    Appellant's relationship with his step-siblings was not bad  when  they
    were younger.  His step-siblings were older than him.  After the  death
    of  his  father,  the  family  land  was  divided  between  them.   The
    Appellant's mother was his father's second wife.

38. The Appellant did not have former  schooling.   The  Appellant  started
    working for a company as an apprentice, and by the age of 18 years  had
    started working as a driver.  He was given a job with AMA in 2004  when
    he was 20 years of age.

39. The job entailed driving a fuel  tanker  and  delivering  fuel  to  the
    American army.  The Appellant undertook this  employment  between  2004
    and 2008.

40. It was on 6th November 2008 when his step-brother attacked him  because
    his employment involved assisting the Americans.  The Appellant was hit
    with a branch and kicked.  This  occurred  in  the  family  home.   The
    Appellant's mother  could  do  nothing  to  prevent  the  attack.   The
    Appellant's step-brother then left the house  and  the  Appellant  also
    left, he stayed with a friend where he had some medical treatment  from
    a local doctor.  His hand was broken.

41. The next morning the Appellant was told that his mother had been killed
    by the Taliban, and his step-brother  told  the  authorities  that  the
    Appellant's mother had asked him to stop working for the Americans, and
    the Appellant had refused and then killed his mother.

42. The Appellant would not stay at his friend's address as this  would  be
    dangerous for his friend's family so he was provided  with  a  car  and
    driven to Peshawar.  An agent was found and the Appellant travelled  to
    the United Kingdom via Greece.

43. The Appellant has a fianc�e  who  still  lives  in  Afghanistan.   They
    became engaged in 2008.  The Appellant had some savings  which  he  was
    going to use for his engagement, but which he later used to finance his
    journey to the United Kingdom.  The Appellant is still in contact  with
    his fianc�e by telephone.

44. The Appellant arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  12th  June  2009  and
    claimed asylum.  He then  absconded  because  he  feared  he  would  be
    deported.

45. The Appellant still experiences pain from the beating that he sustained
    from his step-brother.  His back hurts and there is a  bone  protruding
    due to the injury he sustained, and he has scars on his face, hand, leg
    and arms.  He also suffered an injury to his nose.

46. The Appellant cannot return to Afghanistan  as  he  fears  the  Taliban
    because he was working as a driver  delivering  fuel  to  the  American
    army.  He would be recognised if he returned.  If he went to a new city
    people would know that he had just moved  there  and  the  Taliban  has
    informants everywhere.

47. The Appellant also fears the authorities because they believe  that  he
    killed his mother.

48. The Appellant was briefly cross-examined and asked why he waited  three
    years before pursuing his asylum claim, after initially claiming asylum
    in June 2009.  He said that he was afraid that he would be removed from
    the United Kingdom.

49. By way of clarification I asked the Appellant how he had  obtained  the
    documents listed at E, F and G in the Respondent's bundle these being a
    contract of employment dated 23rd May 2004, a letter from  the  company
    that employed him, stating that he had disappeared on 5th November 2008
    and the company had no information as to  his  whereabouts,  and  three
    photographs of the Appellant in and standing outside a lorry.

50. The Appellant said that Tor Khan who had helped  him  find  employment,
    had obtained  the  documents  and  given  them  to  a  person  who  was
    travelling from Afghanistan to the United Kingdom.   That  person,  who
    the Appellant did not know, had delivered the documents to him in  this
    country.  The Appellant said that the photographs had been in his lorry
    as had his driving licence.  The employment  contract  and  letter  had
    been held by his employer.

51. The psychiatric report referred to the Appellant leaving home  aged  16
    and I asked where he had lived.  The only address that he had  had  was
    his home address, but he said that the office of the  company  that  he
    worked for was in Kabul, and he had worked all over Afghanistan.

52. When asked who had paid the agent to help  him  leave  Afghanistan  and
    travel to the United Kingdom, the Appellant said his  friend  Tor  Khan
    and his father-in-law.  He did not know how much was paid.  He said  it
    was his money that he had left with Tor Khan, who gave it to his father-
    in-law who then paid the agent.

53. There were no questions arising from mine.

The Respondent's Submissions

54. Mr Walker relied upon the reasons for refusal letter dated  26th  April
    2013.  If I found that the Appellant was an employee of a company which
    had been working for the Americans, I was referred to paragraph  34  of
    that letter, and I was also referred to paragraphs 92-101 of H and B in
    support of the submission that the Appellant has a reasonable  internal
    relocation option in Kabul if I found that he had been  working  for  a
    company which provided fuel to the Americans and if  I  found  that  he
    would be at risk in his home area.

The Appellant's Submissions

55. Mr Alexander relied upon the written skeleton argument.  I was asked to
    find the Appellant a credible witness and that reliance could be placed
    upon the documentary evidence.

56. Mr Alexander submitted that the Appellant has a profile that would  put
    him at risk if returned to Afghanistan on the basis that he had  worked
    for a company that assisted the Americans.

57. I was asked to place weight upon the psychiatric report and to conclude
    that there was no adequate treatment available  for  the  Appellant  in
    Afghanistan.  Mr Alexander submitted that the Appellant's health issues
    reached the high threshold set out in N v SSHD [2005] UKHL 37.

58. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

59. In re-making this decision, I have taken into account all the  evidence
    placed before me, both documentary and oral.  If a particular piece  of
    evidence is not referred to, this does not mean that it  has  not  been
    considered.

60. I have considered the evidence in the round,  and  accept  that  it  is
    important that I view the Appellant's account of events, in the context
    of conditions in Afghanistan.

61. I have taken into account paragraph 339L of the Immigration Rules which
    I set out below;

    "It is the duty of the person  to  substantiate  the  asylum  claim  or
    establish that he is a person eligible for humanitarian  protection  or
    substantiate his human rights claim.  Where  aspects  of  the  person's
    statements are not supported by documentary or  other  evidence,  those
    aspects will not need confirmation when all of the following conditions
    are met:

    (i)  the person has made a genuine effort to  substantiate  his  asylum
         claim or establish that he is a person  eligible  for  humanitarian
         protection or substantiate his human rights claim;

    (ii) all material factors at the person's disposal have been submitted,
         and a satisfactory explanation regarding any lack of other relevant
         material has been given;

    (iii)    the person's statements are found to be coherent and plausible
         and  do  not  run  counter  to  available  specific   and   general
         information relevant to the person's case;

    (iv) the person has made an asylum claim or sought to establish that he
         is a person eligible for humanitarian protection or  made  a  human
         rights claim at the earliest possible time, unless the  person  can
         demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and

    (v)  the general credibility  of  the  person  has  been  established".



62. There was no dispute before me as to the  Appellant's  nationality.   A
    report on his nationality had been prepared for the FTT,  and  the  FTT
    had found that he is an Afghan national.  That finding was preserved.

63. I find that the Appellant entered the United Kingdom in June  2009  and
    claimed asylum.  Thereafter he absconded before re-establishing contact
    with the Home Office in June 2012.

64. The Appellant underwent a screening interview on 28th January 2013, and
    a substantive asylum interview on 3rd April 2013.

65. I am satisfied and find as a fact that the Appellant worked as a driver
    in Afghanistan. I make this finding based upon his oral  evidence,  and
    the documentary evidence from  the  company  that  employed  him.   The
    letter heading is different when the  contract  is  compared  with  the
    letter confirming that the Appellant disappeared in November 2008,  but
    I draw no adverse interest from that.  The contract  was  made  in  May
    2004, and it is unclear when the letter was written, but it  must  have
    been sometime after November 2008, therefore there  is  at  least  four
    years difference in time between the two  documents.   It  is  possible
    that the company changed their letter heading.

66. I do not draw adverse inference from the minor discrepancy in  relation
    to dates, in that the Appellant claimed that he  was  attacked  on  6th
    November 2008 and left  Afghanistan  the  following  day,  whereas  the
    letter from his company states that  he  disappeared  on  5th  November
    2008.  Reference in the Respondent's refusal letter  to  15th  November
    2008 is in my view an error.

67. Having accepted that the Appellant worked as a driver in Afghanistan, I
    have to consider the nature of his employment, as it is his  case  that
    because he supplied fuel to the American forces, this caused his  step-
    brother to attack him.  I do not find that the Appellant has discharged
    the burden of proof on this issue.

68. The Appellant's case is that his village was controlled by the Taliban.
     He had worked for the same company, and undertaken the same employment
    for four years without any difficulty whatsoever.  The step-brother was
    aware  of  his  employment.   I  do  not  find  that  any  satisfactory
    explanation has been given as to why the Appellant was able  to  supply
    the Americans with fuel without any difficulties, for a period of  four
    years, while living in a Taliban  controlled  village.   The  Appellant
    confirmed in answer to question 80 of his interview that the village is
    controlled by the Taliban, and in answer to question 57 when asked  how
    people knew he worked for AMA, he said he "was seen by everyone."

69. If the Appellant had been, in effect working for the Americans, and the
    Taliban were aware of this, I conclude that  it  is  reasonably  likely
    that he would not have been able to undertake this employment for  four
    years  without  difficulty.   In  addition  the  documentary   evidence
    produced by AMA does not confirm that the company supplies fuel to  the
    American forces.  There is no reference to this either in the  contract
    or the letter.  The Appellant when interviewed and asked for details of
    his employment, was vague in providing details as to where he delivered
    the fuel.

70. Although there is a low standard of proof, I  conclude  that  the  only
    evidence  that  the  Appellant  worked  for  the  Americans,   is   the
    Appellant's own assertion.  The low burden of proof does not mean  that
    I  have  to  accept  an  assertion  that  is  made  without  any  other
    independent  evidence.   I  accept  there   is   no   requirement   for
    corroboration, but having considered the evidence in the  round,  I  do
    not accept that  the  Appellant  delivered  fuel  to  American  forces.



71. I do accept that the Appellant was attacked.  I place weight  upon  the
    medical report prepared by Mr Mason dated 25th  July  2013.   I  accept
    that Mr Mason is an expert in  his  field,  and  note  his  opinion  in
    paragraph 6.1, that in  themselves,  the  Appellant's  scars  are  non-
    specific and the injuries  to  his  nose  not  uncommon.   However,  as
    explained in paragraph 6.3, taken together, Mr Mason's opinion is  that
    the Appellant's lesions are highly consistent with his account of being
    assaulted approximately three and a half years before Mr Mason's report
    was prepared.  Mr Mason notes that the lesions on the right forearm and
    hand could easily result from warding off  blows,  and  the  scars  and
    lesions on his right eyebrow and nose strongly suggest that they result
    from blows from a hard object.  'Highly consistent', means the  lesions
    could have been caused by the trauma described, and  there  are  a  few
    other possible causes.

72. I therefore accept that the Appellant was attacked, and I  am  prepared
    to accept his account that he was attacked by his step-brother.  What I
    do not accept,  is  that  this  attack  was  caused  by  the  Appellant
    delivering fuel to American forces.  I note in paragraphs 15 and 18  of
    the  psychiatric  report  dated  17th  July  2014  that  the  Appellant
    describes his three step-brothers as being cruel to  him,  beating  him
    and insulting him, although he claims that after leaving home  aged  16
    he did not have any further problems from them.

73. There is however according to the Appellant's own case,  a  history  of
    his step-brothers beating him and acting in a cruel manner towards him.

74. I do not accept that the Appellant's mother was killed by  the  Taliban
    as a result of the Appellant's activities.  I note the absence  of  any
    documentary evidence to prove the death of the Appellant's mother,  but
    I do not place great weight on this absence.  I  appreciate  in  asylum
    cases it is  often  very  difficult  to  obtain  documentary  evidence,
    although in this case, the Appellant was  able  to  obtain  documentary
    evidence as to his employment.

75. The Appellant's account is that he was attacked  by  his  step-brother,
    and in paragraph 3 of his witness statement the Appellant explains that
    his step-brother then left the house.  After this  he  spoke  with  his
    mother, and the Appellant left the house in the evening.  If the  step-
    brother wished to kill the Appellant, he could  have  attempted  to  do
    that at that time, but did not, and left the  Appellant  in  the  house
    with his mother.  The Appellant  (at  question  67  of  his  interview)
    explained that his mother was killed because the Taliban  went  to  his
    home, and found out that he had left, his step-brother  suggested  that
    the Appellant's mother should be killed so  that  the  Appellant  would
    return, so that they could  catch  him  and  kill  him.   This  is  not
    credible in my view.  If the step-brother and Taliban  wished  to  have
    killed  the  Appellant,  the  step-brother  would  not  have  left  the
    Appellant at his home, giving him ample opportunity to leave  once  the
    step-brother had departed.

76. The Appellant has not proved  to  a  reasonable  degree  of  likelihood
    either that his mother was killed, or that  the  authorities  had  been
    told the Appellant had killed her.  The Appellant in paragraph 3 of his
    witness statement explains that his step-brother told  the  authorities
    the Appellant's mother had asked him to stop working for the Americans,
    the Appellant refused and then killed his mother.   The  Appellant  has
    not proved how he came to receive that  information.   The  Appellant's
    case in answering question 66  of  his  interview  was  that  the  next
    morning his friend told him that he had been  informed  of  this  by  a
    doctor.  A different account was given by the  Appellant  in  answering
    question 72 of the interview, when he said his  friend  discovered  his
    mother's death at morning prayer in the mosque when he met  a  villager
    who told him what had happened.  The Appellant has  not  satisfactorily
    explained how he was aware of the account given to the  authorities  by
    his step-brother.

77. I accept that the Appellant left Afghanistan using an agent.  I do  not
    find it credible that he would be unaware how much was  paid.   He  has
    said that some of the money that was used belonged to him and therefore
    he would know how much money he had used.  He has said that funds  were
    also given by his father-in-law.  If this  event  had  occurred  as  he
    claimed, I find that he would be aware what amount of  money  had  been
    paid.

78. However I do accept that he travelled through various countries  before
    illegally  entering  the  United  Kingdom  and  claiming  asylum   when
    discovered.

79. I have to consider section 8 of the 2004  Act,  and  I  find  that  the
    Appellant's absconding for a period of three years  after  his  initial
    asylum claim, does adversely affect his credibility.  I find  that  his
    conduct invokes section 8(2)(c) on the basis that it  was  designed  or
    likely to obstruct or delay the handling or resolution of his claim, or
    the taking of a decision in relation to him.  I do not accept that  the
    Appellant has  adequately  explained  why  he  lived  in  this  country
    illegally for three years before claiming asylum.  His case is that  he
    came to the United Kingdom  to  claim  asylum,  and  he  has  given  no
    rational explanation as to why having claimed asylum, he then absconded
    for a period of three years.  I do not accept that the Appellant feared
    that he would be immediately deported as he had travelled a substantial
    distance, at financial cost to himself, in order to claim  asylum,  and
    if he genuinely feared for his life, he would have pursued  his  asylum
    claim rather than absconding.

80. I conclude that the Appellant is a  national  of  Afghanistan  who  was
    attacked by his step-brother.  The Appellant  worked  as  a  driver  in
    Afghanistan.  I do not accept that the Appellant worked for  a  company
    that delivered fuel to  the  Americans.   I  do  not  accept  that  the
    Appellant's mother was killed nor do I accept that the Appellant's step-
    brother reported to the authorities that the Appellant had  killed  his
    mother.  I do not accept as credible  the  Appellant's  explanation  in
    answer to question 96 of his interview, that the  report  was  made  so
    that the Appellant would be arrested by the authorities and imprisoned,
    and then when he was released his step-brothers would be able  to  harm
    him.

81. I do not find that the Taliban would have any reason to have an adverse
    interest in the Appellant.  The Appellant's  difficulty  was  with  his
    step-brother not  the  Taliban,  and  therefore  I  conclude  that  the
    Appellant could in fact return to his home area and if  necessary  seek
    protection from the police.

82. However in the alternative, I have considered whether the Appellant has
    the option of internally relocating to the city of Kabul,  and  whether
    this would be unduly harsh.

83. I find that relocating to the city of Kabul would not be unduly  harsh.
    I make this finding having taken into  account  the  diagnosis  in  the
    psychiatric report.

84. I have considered PM and Others Afghanistan CG [2007] UKAIT 00089 which
    is referred to in paragraph 33 of H and B,  and  in  summary  indicates
    that if an individual has a well-founded fear in their home area, it is
    reasonable to expect them to live in Kabul which is a functioning city.
     Relocation there would not be unreasonable.

85. A similar conclusion was reached in  RQ  Afghanistan  CG  [2008]  UKAIT
    00013, which is referred to in paragraph 34 of H and  B,  in  which  in
    brief summary it was decided that unless there were particular reasons,
    it would not be unduly harsh to expect an Appellant with no  individual
    risk factors to relocate to Kabul.

86. I have also considered AK Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT  00163  (IAC)  and
    set out below paragraph (iv) of section B of the head note;

    "(iv)    whilst when assessing a claim in the context of Article  15(c)
         in which the Respondent asserts that Kabul City would be  a  viable
         internal relocation alternative,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into
         account (both in assessing safety and reasonableness) not only  the
         level  of  violence  in  that  city  but  also   the   difficulties
         experienced by that  city's  poor  and  also  the  many  Internally
         Displaced Persons (IDPs) living there,  these  considerations  will
         not in general make return to Kabul unsafe or unreasonable."

87. The decision in H and B is not binding upon the Tribunal,  but  may  be
    regarded as persuasive authority.  In  that  decision  the  court  were
    considering two Appellants who had previously worked for the UN and  US
    forces and found in paragraph 97;

         "the Court considers that there is insufficient evidence before  it
         at the present time to suggest that the Taliban have the motivation
         or the ability to pursue low level collaborators in Kabul or  other
         areas outside their control."

    In this appeal, I have not  found  that  the  Appellant  worked  for  a
    company supplying fuel to the American forces and therefore  would  not
    be regarded by the Taliban as a collaborator.  However even if  he  had
    undertaken that employment, bearing in mind the length of time that has
    elapsed since that employment ceased in 2008, and the findings  in  the
    country guidance decisions referred  to  above,  and  in  H  and  B,  I
    conclude  that  the  Appellant  would  not  be  at   risk   in   Kabul.



88. I therefore conclude that the Appellant is not entitled to a  grant  of
    asylum.

89.  I  conclude  that  the  Appellant  is  not  entitled  to  a  grant  of
    humanitarian protection.  The decision in AK Afghanistan makes it clear
    that the level of indiscriminate violence in Afghanistan,  taken  as  a
    whole, is not at such a high level as to mean that, within the  meaning
    of Article 15(c) of  the  Qualification  Directive,  that  a  civilian,
    solely by being present  in  the  country,  faces  a  real  risk  which
    threatens his life or person.

90. For the same reason I find that Article 3 of the 1950  Convention  will
    not be breached if the Appellant was returned to Afghanistan.   I  have
    to consider Article 3 on medical grounds, in  view  of  the  contention
    made by Mr Alexander that the Appellant's depression and post traumatic
    stress disorder is of such a  high  level,  that  Article  3  would  be
    breached by reason of his removal to Afghanistan.  I do not accept this
    to be the case.  It was decided in GS and EO (Article 3 - Health Cases)
    India [2012] UKUT 00397 (IAC) that the fact  that  life  expectancy  is
    dramatically shortened by withdrawal of medical treatment in  the  host
    state is in itself incapable of amounting  to  the  highly  exceptional
    case that engages the Article 3 duty.  In  this  appeal,  there  is  no
    satisfactory evidence that the Appellant's  life  expectancy  would  be
    dramatically shortened if he was removed to Afghanistan.

91. The mental health issues that the Appellant now relies upon,  have  not
    been considered by the Respondent, nor the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    Appellant made no mention of mental health  issues  in  his  interviews
    save to say that he had memory problems.   The  Appellant's  solicitors
    were  unaware  that  he  was  suffering  from  depression  and   taking
    medication.

92. There is no evidence that the Appellant consulted any  doctors  in  the
    United Kingdom during the period in which he was listed as an absconder
    between June 2009 and June 2012.  The psychiatric report  at  paragraph
    25 refers to an assessment of the  Appellant  on  17th  September  2013
    which concluded that the Appellant had an adjustment  disorder  and  it
    was recommended that he seek support, and that his GP prescribe him the
    anti-depressant mirtazapine.  Dr Wootton interviewed the  Appellant  on
    10th July 2014.  At paragraph 47 of the report Dr Wootton confirms that
    she is reliant primarily on the Appellant's account to her.  It  is  an
    account that I have not found to be credible.

93. In paragraph 48 Dr  Wootton  confirms  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
    criteria  for  a  diagnosis  of  post  traumatic  stress  disorder  and
    depressive disorder.  It is relevant that Dr Wootton states;

         "Clearly  I  am  reliant  on  Mr  Safi's  account  in  making  this
         diagnosis."

94. While I of course accept Dr Wootton's expertise, it  is  relevant  that
    she has stated on two separate occasions that she is reliant  upon  the
    Appellant's account.  The credibility of an account must be assessed by
    a judge, and in this case, I have found the account not to be credible,
    with the exception being that I accept the Appellant  was  attacked  by
    his step-brother.

95. I accept that the  Appellant  is  currently  receiving  anti-depressant
    medication  and  that  psychological   therapy   and   medication   are
    recommended for the treatment of depressive disorder and PTSD.

96. In my view there is no evidence contained within the psychiatric report
    to prove that the Appellant's life expectancy  would  be  shortened  by
    withdrawal of medical treatment in the United Kingdom.  Dr Wootton does
    not state that there is a high risk of suicide.  She  states  that  the
    Appellant has reported ongoing suicidal thoughts  but  not  acted  upon
    those thoughts.

97. Dr Wootton comments in paragraph 55 that the prospect of  returning  to
    Afghanistan is likely to increase the  Appellant's  stress.   I  accept
    that to be the case, as the Appellant has made it clear that he  wishes
    to live in the United Kingdom.

98. However, in considering the  Appellant's  mental  health  issues  under
    Article 3, I do not find that there would be a breach of Article  3  if
    the Appellant was removed to Afghanistan.

99. I move on to consider Article 8.  It is  accepted  that  the  Appellant
    cannot satisfy Appendix FM as he has no family members  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He is not in a relationship and has no children.

100. It is  also  accepted  that  he  cannot  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE because he has not lived in the United Kingdom for  at
    least twenty years, and it is not contended that  he  has  no  ties  to
    Afghanistan.

101. I have to consider whether Article 8 should be considered  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  In my view this would be appropriate in  this  case
    because of the Appellant's mental health issues.   I  have  taken  into
    account Akhalu (Health Claim: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT  00400  (IAC)
    and set out below paragraphs 1 and 2 of the head note;

         "(1) MM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
             [2012] EWCA Civ 279 does not  establish  that  a  claimant  is
             disqualified from accessing the protection of Article 8  where
             an aspect of her claim is a difficulty or inability to  access
             healthcare in her country of nationality unless, possibly, her
             private or family life has a bearing upon her prognosis.   The
             correct approach is not to leave out of account  what  is,  by
             any view, a material consideration of  central  importance  to
             the  individual  concerned   but   to   recognise   that   the
             countervailing public interest in removal  will  outweigh  the
             consequences for the health  of  the  claimant  because  of  a
             disparity of healthcare facilities in all but a very few  rare
             cases.

         2) The consequences of removal for the health of the  claimant  who
            would not be able  to  access  equivalent  healthcare  in  their
            country of nationality as was  available  in  this  country  are
            plainly relevant to the question of proportionality.  But,  when
            weighed against the public interest in ensuring that the limited
            resources of this country's health service are not used  to  the
            best effect for the benefit of those for whom they are intended,
            those consequences do not weigh heavily in the claimant's favour
            but  speak  cogently  in  support  of  the  public  interest  in
            removal."



102. I accept that the Appellant is currently receiving medication  for  his
    depression.  I accept that  he  displays  symptoms  of  post  traumatic
    stress disorder, even though I have not accepted in full,  his  account
    of what he claims occurred in Afghanistan.  I take  into  account  that
    the Appellant was able to live in this  country,  without  seeking  any
    assistance for his mental health problems  for  at  least  three  years
    between June 2009 and June 2012.

103. I accept that the health facilities  in  Afghanistan  are  considerably
    below what is available in this country.  I have considered the Country
    of Origin Information Report on Afghanistan dated  15th  February  2013
    and the section on mental health at paragraphs 28.46  to  28.50.   This
    confirms the lack of adequate facilities in Afghanistan.

104. However I have to balance the public interest, against  the  wishes  of
    the Appellant to remain in the United Kingdom and to receive  treatment
    for his mental  health  issues.   I  conclude,  attaching  considerable
    weight to the  decision  in  Akhalu,  that  the  public  interest  does
    outweigh the consequences for  the  health  of  the  Appellant.   Those
    consequences will be that he is not likely to  receive  the  medication
    that he currently receives.  That does not amount to a life threatening
    condition.  I take into account my finding that the Appellant would not
    be at risk in Afghanistan.  I take into account the fact  that  he  was
    able to function without any medical assistance in this country for  at
    least three years.

105. I conclude that the Respondent's decision to remove the Appellant  from
    the United Kingdom is proportionate and does not breach  Article  8  of
    the 1950 Convention.



Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law and  was  set  aside.   I  substitute  a  fresh  decision  as
follows.

I dismiss the appeal on asylum grounds.

The Appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection.

I dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.





Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.  There  was  no
application  for  anonymity,  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  does  not  make  an
anonymity order.
