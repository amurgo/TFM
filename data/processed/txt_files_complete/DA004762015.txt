                                                                   Appellant

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr D Paxton, instructed by South West Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I make an anonymity order under  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698  as  amended)  in  order  to
    protect the anonymity  of  the  respondent  (UIV)  who  has  two  minor
    children.  This order prohibits the disclosure directly  or  indirectly
    (including by the parties) of the  identity  of  the  respondent.   Any
    disclosure and breach of this order may amount to a contempt of  court.
    This order shall remain in force unless revoked or varied by a Tribunal
    or court.

Introduction

 2. For convenience, although this is an appeal by the Secretary of  State,
    I shall refer to the parties as they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 9 July 1983.  He
    came to the UK as a student on 10 December 2003.  On 18 November  2008,
    the appellant went through an Islamic marriage with a  Polish  national
    in the UK ("IH").  The appellant and IH have two children, a  son  born
    on 10 August 2011 and a daughter born  on  14  August  2014.  Both  are
    British citizens.   On  9  November  2009  the  appellant  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain.

 4. On 20 July 2010, the appellant left the UK and he re-entered the UK  on
    an unknown date later in 2010.  On 19 November  2010,  he  applied  for
    naturalisation as a British citizen.

 5. At some point, the appellant again left the  UK.   He  returned  on  26
    January 2013 and sought leave  to  enter  as  a  returning  citizen  at
    Heathrow Airport.  He was arrested  and  detained  because  he  was  in
    breach of police bail conditions in leaving the UK  in  relation  to  a
    number of fraud offences of which he was subsequently convicted.

 6. On 14 May 2013, the appellant was convicted  on  eight  counts  at  the
    Bristol  Crown  Court  and  three  counts  of  with  intent   knowingly
    possessing a false/improperly obtained/another  ID  document  and  five
    counts of possessing/controlling  a  false/improperly  obtained/another
    person's ID document.  He was sentenced to a term of  eighteen  months'
    imprisonment on each count to run concurrently.

 7. On 11 June 2013, the appellant was served with a notice of liability to
    be deported.  In response,  the  appellant  relied  upon  Art  8.   The
    appellant's outstanding naturalisation application was  refused  on  17
    July 2013.

 8. On 17 September 2013, the Home Office wrote to the appellant  enquiring
    whether he wished to apply for a residence  document  as  an  "extended
    family member" of an  EEA  national  in  a  durable  relationship.   No
    response was made to that letter.

 9. On 18 February 2014, a deportation order was signed  and  sent  to  the
    appellant together with a decision letter on 11 March 2014.

10. The appellant lodged an appeal against that decision on 24 March 2014.

11. On 28 April 2014, the appellant married his partner, IH.

12. As a result of that marriage,  the  Secretary  of  State  withdrew  the
    decision to deport the appellant and,  following  further  submissions,
    made a fresh decision on September 2015 to deport the  appellant,  (who
    is now a 'family member' of an  EEA  national)  under  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regs 2006 (SI 2006/1003 as amended) ("the  EEA  Regulations")  on
    the grounds of public policy pursuant to regs 19(3)(b)  and  21.   That
    decision was taken on 6 October 2015 and a fresh deportation order  was
    signed on 8 September 2015.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

13. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge Coaster on 14 December 2015.  Judge Coaster  found  that
    the appellant did not represent a "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society"
    and that, therefore, his deportation was not justified on  the  grounds
    of public policy under reg 19(3)(b) read with reg 21(5)(c) of  the  EEA
    Regulations.  Consequently, the Judge allowed the appellant's appeal.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

14. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on, essentially, two grounds.  First, the judge had misapplied
    the EEA Regulations, in particular reg 21(4) concerned with the need to
    establish "imperative grounds of public security" where  an  individual
    can establish 10 years' continuous  residence.   Secondly,  in  finding
    that  the  appellant  did  not  represent  a  "genuine,   present   and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society", the  judge  had  failed  to  take  into  account  all  the
    circumstances in assessing the appellant's propensity to offend and had
    paid insufficient regard to the seriousness of his offending.

15. On 24 February 2016 the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Frankish)  granted
    the Secretary of State permission to appeal.

16. On 22 March 2016, the appellant served  a  rule  24  reply  seeking  to
    uphold the First-tier Tribunal's decision on the basis that  the  judge
    had correctly applied the EEA Regulations  and  her  finding  that  the
    appellant had not been shown to be a "genuine, present and sufficiently
    serious threat" was not perverse and was properly open to the judge  on
    the evidence.

17. Thus, the appeal came before me.

Discussion

18. Mr McVeety, who represented the Secretary of  State  did  not  seek  to
    press the first ground of appeal, namely that the judge had  misapplied
    the relevant provisions of the EEA Regulations.  He was entirely  right
    not to do so.

19. The Secretary of State's decision was taken on the  grounds  of  public
    policy pursuant to reg 19(3)(b) which provides as follows:

         "...an EEA national who has  entered  the  United  Kingdom  or  the
         family member of such a national who has entered the United Kingdom
         may be removed if -

          ....

         (b)  the Secretary of State has decided that the  person's  removal
             is justified on grounds of public policy, public  security  or
             public health in accordance with regulation 21; ..."

20.  Regulation 21 provides, so far as relevant as follows:

         "Decisions taken on  public  policy,  public  security  and  public
         health grounds

           21 (1) In this regulation a 'relevant  decision'  means  an  EEA
                  decision taken on the grounds  of  public  policy,  public
                  security or public health.

             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
                  ends.

             (3)  A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
                  person  with  a  permanent  right   of   residence   under
                  regulation 15 except on serious grounds of  public  policy
                  or public security.

             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
                  grounds of public security in respect of an  EEA  national
                  who -

                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                      period of at least ten years prior  to  the  relevant
                      decision; or

                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                      is necessary in best interests, as  provided  for  in
                      the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted  by
                      the General Assembly of the United  Nations  on  20th
                      November 1989.

             (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds  of  public
                  policy  or  public  security  it  shall,  in  addition  to
                  complying  with   the   preceding   paragraphs   of   this
                  regulation, but taken in  accordance  with  the  following
                  principles -

                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                      proportionality;

                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                      personal conduct of the person concerned.

                  (c)  the personal conduct of  the  person  concerned  must
                      represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
                      threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of
                      society;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                      which relate to considerations of general  prevention
                      do not justify the decision.

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                      themselves justify the decision.

             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
                  public policy or public security in relation to  a  person
                  who is resident in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker
                  must take account of considerations such as the age, state
                  of health, family and economic situation  of  the  person,
                  the person's length of residence in  the  United  Kingdom,
                  the person's social  and  cultural  integration  into  the
                  United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
                  his country of origin. ...."

21. The proper structure for decision-making is well recognised  (see,  for
    example Bulale v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 806).   In  summary,  a  decision
    taken on grounds of "public policy" must be taken  in  accordance  with
    provisions of reg 21.

22. First, the individual's personal conduct  must  "represent  a  genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society" (see reg 21(5)(c).

23. Secondly, the EEA Regulations set out a three tier hierarchy of  levels
    of protection from removal or deportation with increasing stringency:

      a) a general protection criterion that deportation or removal  may  be
         justified "on the grounds of  public  policy,  public  security  or
         public health" (reg 21(1));

      b) a heightened protection  criterion,  applicable  to  those  with  a
         permanent rights of residence, that they  may  not  be  removed  or
         deported "except on serious grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
         security" (reg 21(3); and

      c) the enhanced protection criterion, applicable to a person "who  has
         resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of  at  least
         ten years prior to the relevant decision", who may not  be  removed
         except on "imperative grounds of public security" (reg 21(4)(a));

         (see LG (Italy) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 190 at [14] per Carnwath  LJ
         and Bulale at [8] per Buxton LJ).

24. Thirdly, any decision to remove or deport  an  individual  must  comply
    with the principle of proportionality (see reg 21(5)(a)).

25. Fourthly, reg 21(5) sets out a number  of  principles  with  which  any
    decision must comply: it must be  based  exclusively  on  the  personal
    conduct of the individual; matters isolated from the particulars of the
    case or which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do  not
    justify a decision; and a  person's  previous  convictions  do  not  in
    themselves justify a decision.

26. Finally, reg 21(6) sets out a number of factors  which  must  be  taken
    into account:

         "The age, state of health, family and  economic  situation  of  the
         person, person's length of residence in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
         person's social and cultural integration into  the  United  Kingdom
         and the extent of the person's links with his country of origin."

27. The first of the Secretary of State's grounds argue that the judge  was
    wrong to apply, and take into account, the principles set  out  in  reg
    21(5).  The basis for this is not entirely clear.  In  paragraph  1  of
    the grounds, it is said that the appellant had a  "right  of  permanent
    residence" under the EEA Regulations.  Further in para 3 of the grounds
    it is asserted that the appellant was  not  entitled  to  rely  on  the
    "imperative grounds of  public  security"  basis  for  removal  in  reg
    21(4)(a) because  he  could  not  establish  a  period  of  ten  years'
    continuous residence prior to the decision to deport him.

28. Before the judge,  it  was  accepted  by  the  appellant  (through  his
    Counsel) that he could only rely upon the "general criterion" that  his
    deportation had to be justified  on  the  grounds  of  "public  policy,
    public security or public health".  As the judge noted in  para  46  of
    her determination, the appellant accepted that he could not establish a
    permanent right of residence as he could not demonstrate  that  he  had
    been a "family member" living in the UK  in  accordance  with  the  EEA
    Regulations for the  required  five  years  in  order  to  establish  a
    permanent right of residence under reg 15.   There  was  no  suggestion
    before the judge that the appellant  was  entitled  to  rely  upon  the
    'enhanced protection criterion' in reg 21(4)(a) based upon  ten  years'
    continuous period of residence in the UK.  The case  before  the  judge
    was, therefore, argued on the basis that  the  appellant's  deportation
    had to be justified on grounds of "public policy".  That  is  precisely
    the approach that the judge took.  Contrary to what appears to be  said
    in para 3 of the Secretary of State's grounds, reg 21(5) was applicable
    to that assessment as, in fact, it would be to any  decision  taken  on
    the grounds of "public policy, public security or public  health"  (see
    reg 21(1) and (5))  whatever  the  level  of  protection  -  "general",
    "heightened" or "enhanced" - applied.

29. As a result, the first question which the judge had to address was that
    in reg 21(5)(c)  namely  whether  it  had  been  established  that  the
    personal conduct of the appellant represented "a genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat  affecting  the  fundamental  interests  of
    society".  That is precisely the matter which the judge found  in  para
    57 of her decision was not satisfied.

30. Consequently, the judge did not err in her approach by applying reg  21
    of the EEA Regulations, in particular the "public  policy"  requirement
    and addressing and making  a finding upon the initially issue  set  out
    in reg 21(5)(c).

31. The Secretary of State's second ground challenges the  judge's  finding
    on that issue.  The judge  dealt  with  the  question  of  whether  the
    appellant represented a  "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat" at paras 50 - 57 as follows:

         "50. I therefore address the first question to  be  decided  first,
             which is whether the appellant at the date of the decision  to
             deport represents a genuine  present  and  sufficient  serious
             threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society.
             The offences occurred between December  2008  and  June  2009,
             over 6 years ago.  The appellant was convicted in May 2013 and
             served half of an 18 month prison sentence.  He  was  released
             from  prison  in  November  2013.   The  appellant   was   not
             prosecuted  for  breach  of  bail  conditions.   He  was   not
             prosecuted in 2010 for earlier allegations of deception in his
             application for indefinite leave to  remain.   The  Disclosure
             and Barring Service check obtain in  June  2015  disclosed  no
             further convictions.  I  therefore  reasonably  conclude  that
             that the appellant has not re-offended since June 2009 over  a
             period from that date of 6� years.

         51.  With regard to rehabilitation and the  risk  of  re-offending,
             the appellant's offender manager assessed him as a low risk in
             June 2013 and no rehabilitation classes were organised due  to
             the remaining short duration of his period  in  prison  before
             being released on licence.  Nor  has  the  appellant  attended
             rehabilitation  classes  arranged  privately  to  address  the
             issues which caused him to  offend  original.   The  appellant
             took  medication  for  PTSD  and   attended   10   consecutive
             appointments at  the  Post  Traumatic  Stress  clinic  at  the
             Christchurch family medical centre in Downend, Bristol between
             August and November 2011.  It is apparent from the appellant's
             evidence to the Tribunal that he  recognised  that  he  had  a
             stress  reaction  to  his  arrest  and  interrogation   as   a
             consequence of his criminal conduct.

         52.   The  Secretary  of  State  discounted  the  effect   of   the
             appellant's wife and children to prevent the appellant's  risk
             of reoffending as neither his wife nor his young children  had
             "prevented" him from committing the offences in the six months
             between December 2008 and June 2009.  The appellant  had  only
             recently commenced his relationship with  Ms  Harnasz  at  the
             time in 2008 and the appellant' first child was not born until
             2011 and the second child in 2014.  The Secretary  of  State's
             reliance on this ground for supporting the decision  regarding
             a continuing risk of re-offending is not justified.  I find on
             the evidence that the appellant's young family have  a  strong
             deterrent effect on the appellant's likelihood to re-offend.

         53.  The Secretary of State produced no evidence of an up  to  date
             assessment of the likelihood of re-offending taking the  above
             factors into account.  The appellant had been  served  with  a
             liability to deportation  letter  in  June  2013  and  with  a
             deportation order  served  in  March  2014.   The  deportation
             decision was unilaterally withdrawn by the Secretary of  State
             in June 2014 and a second notice of deportation was served  on
             the appellant in September 2015.   During  the  18  month  gap
             between the two deportation notices,  the  appellant  was  not
             detained.  He remained with his family.  There was no evidence
             in the refusal letter of 8th September 2015 of a re-assessment
             of the propensity to re-offend to deport the  appellant  given
             any weight to the the passage of  time  during  which  no  re-
             offending had taken place, not the significant changes in  the
             appellant's circumstances and responsibilities.  The burden of
             proof is on the Secretary of State to show that the  appellant
             posed (i) a present risk to society; and (ii)  a  genuine  and
             sufficiently serious threat: Wahl-v-Iceland [2014] 1  CMLR  29
             at  paragraphs  129-130.   Past  convictions  alone  are   not
             sufficient  to  justify  the  appellant's  deportation.   Past
             convictions carry less weight the longer the period  in  which
             there is no-reoffending.

         54.  Is the "failure" by the  appellant  to  attend  rehabilitation
             classes is sufficient to reach a conclusion that  there  is  a
             high risk of re-offending.  I find that it is  not  sufficient
             in the context of the appellant's present  circumstances:  his
             recognition of the effect of further crime on  his  children's
             future; his family's reliance on him and  the  lengthy  period
             over which he has not reoffended.  He was assessed as low risk
             in June 2013 and  nothing  his  changed  since  that  date  to
             increase the assessment  to  a  higher  level  of  risk.   The
             evidence suggests that the appellant has been rehabilitated.

         55.  I am satisfied  that  the  appellant  is  remorseful  for  his
             conduct and he fully recognises the  potentially  catastrophic
             effect that his criminal conduct has had on his wife and young
             children.   The  appellant  is  sorry  for  the   trauma   and
             difficulties that his conduct his brought upon his family  and
             I accept that he  was  honest  in  admitting  that  he  deeply
             regretted  his  involvement  in   criminal   activities.    He
             recognises  that  his  family's  wellbeing  is  all  that   is
             important to him.

         56.  Stepping back and considering in the round the evidence and my
             conclusions at paragraphs  50  -  55  above,  and  whilst  not
             diminishing  in  any  way  the  seriousness   of   the   fraud
             convictions arising from  the  appellant's  conduct  over  six
             years ago, I find that the appellant does not pose  a  genuine
             present risk and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of
             the fundamental interests of society.  There  is  no  evidence
             that he had a continuing propensity to  commit  crime  at  the
             date of the deportation decision.  The evidence points in  the
             opposition direction.  In reaching this conclusion I have also
             had regard to assessing what constitutes a 'serious' threat to
             the general public.  Whilst not diminishing the seriousness of
             fraud convictions, the appellant's conduct, being  essentially
             white collar fraud  can  be  distinguished  in  severity  from
             convictions for criminal  conduct  such  as  sexual  or  other
             physical violence or drug trafficking.  I have also  borne  in
             mind the appellant's evasive conduct in re-entering the United
             Kingdom in November 2010.  Whilst his  return  to  the  United
             Kingdom displayed a  lack  of  honesty  in  dealing  with  the
             immigration authorities it does not prove on  the  balance  of
             probabilities that he has the propensity to commit  a  serious
             and elaborate fraud in the future.

         57.  I find therefore on  the  weight  of  the  evidence  that  the
             decision to deport the appellant does not  satisfy  Regulation
             21(5)(c) of the EEA Regulations and the appeal must  therefore
             succeed.   Having  reached  this  conclusion   there   is   no
             requirement to go  on  and  consider  Art  8  or  S55  Borders
             Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009."

32. On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr McVeety, adopted para 5  of  the
    grounds and submitted that the judge had erred in reaching her  finding
    in respect  of  the  likelihood  or  (lack  of  it)  of  the  appellant
    reoffending.  In particular, although the judge had taken into  account
    the appellant's remorsefulness and the impact upon  his  family  if  he
    reoffended, the judge had not considered the appellant's motivation for
    the offending or had not expressed any sympathy for the victims of  the
    crime.  Further, the judge had not had regard to  the  consequences  of
    the appellant's offending and, at para 56, had simply stated  that  the
    offence could have been worse and had thereby lessened the  seriousness
    of the offence. I do not accept those submissions.

33. It is clear from reading paras 50 - 57  of  the  judge's  determination
    that she gave detailed and careful consideration to  all  the  evidence
    that was presented at the hearing.  As the judge noted,  there  was  no
    OASys Report and no up-to-date assessment as to the appellant's risk of
    re-offending.  The most recent was  in  June  2013  when  his  offender
    manager had assessed the risk as "low".  The judge properly noted  that
    the offences dated back to December 2008 and June 2009 which was (then)
    over six years ago.  Since then the appellant had served  half  of  his
    eighteen months' sentence and had been released in November  2013.   He
    had  not  reoffended.   The  judge  also  noted  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's remorse and, in particular in paras 52 and 55, accepted  on
    the basis of the evidence before her that the appellant's family (which
    included his wife and two young children born in August 2011 and August
    2014) operated as a "strong deterrent effect" on his reoffending.  That
    was a factual finding that  the  judge  was  entitled  to  make  having
    considered, and accepted,  the  evidence.   Further,  the  judge  fully
    considered the appellant's circumstances and reached a finding that the
    appellant was "rehabilitated".  The judge, no doubt, had well  in  mind
    the remarks of the sentencing judge, which she set out at paras 23  and
    24 of her determination, that it was unclear (at  the  trial)  why  the
    appellant had engaged in the elaborate  fraud  which  had  led  to  his
    convictions.  There was no evidence of his motivation but there was  an
    abundance of evidence (which the judge was entitled to accept) that  he
    had every motivation in the future not to reoffend.  The judge accepted
    that  the  appellant  was  "remorseful  for  his  conduct"  (para  55).
    Although that paragraph is couched in terms of his remorse  as  to  the
    "potentially catastrophic affect"  his  criminal  conduct  had  on  his
    family, it is unclear whether the appellant was asked  at  the  hearing
    about whether he was remorseful in respect of the impact his fraud  had
    had upon any victims.  It is not clear from  the  Crown  Court  judge's
    sentencing remark (at A37 - 38 of the respondent's bundle),  which  are
    brief, what was the precise nature of the fraud and who, if  any,  were
    the victims of it.  In any event, the overall picture, accepted by  the
    judge,  was  that  the  appellant  regretted  his  offending  and   was
    rehabilitated such that there  was  no  genuine,  present  risk"  of  a
    "sufficiently serious threat" by the appellant reoffending.  The  issue
    of his propensity to offend was a factual assessment to be made by  the
    Judge.  Her findings are clear and firmly based in  the  evidence.  She
    was clearly aware of all the relevant matters  and  her  reasons  fully
    justify her findings and I am unable to see any basis upon  which  they
    could be said to be irrational or perverse.

34. Finally, in reaching her decision the judge did take into  account  the
    seriousness of the appellant's offending specifically at para 56.   She
    did not fail to give adequate  consideration  to  it  in  reaching  her
    decision. It was not inappropriate for the judge to  observe  that  the
    appellant's conviction for fraud did not fully equate to  the  severity
    of offences, recognised by the Secretary of State  when  they  involved
    sexual or physical violence or drug offences.  The judge did  not  seek
    to "lessen" the seriousness of the appellant's actual  offending.   The
    judge specifically pointed out that, by drawing the contrast  with  the
    appellant's offending, she did not seek to "diminish...the  seriousness
    of fraud convictions" and explicitly referred to the damaging effect of
    passport and ID document fraud (see paras 56 and 48).

35. In any event, the finding of the judge was that the appellant  did  not
    have a "continuing propensity to commit crime".  He was, therefore, not
    a "present" threat falling within reg 21(5)(c).

36. The judge's findings were properly open to her and were not rational or
    perverse and were based upon all the evidence.

37. For these reasons, the judge  did  not  err  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal under the EEA Regulations.

Decision

38.  Consequently,  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  to   allow   the
    appellant's appeal under the EEA Regulations did not involve the making
    of an error of law and that decision stands.

39. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

40. At the conclusion of the hearing, Mr Paxton  made  an  application  for
    costs to be awarded against the Home Office under rule 10(3)(d) of  the
    Tribunal Proceedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (SI  2008/2698  as
    amended)  on  the  basis  that  the  Secretary  of  State   had   acted
    "unreasonably in bringing, defending or  conducting  the  proceedings".
    Both representatives made submissions on the issue of costs.   However,
    prior to the next case  being  called  on,  in  which  Mr  Paxton  also
    appeared, I pointed out that rule 10(5) required that  any  application
    for costs be made in writing and include a schedule of  costs  claimed.
    That provision was not satisfied.  In the  light  of  that,  Mr  Paxton
    withdrew his oral application for costs reserving the right to  make  a
    written application subsequently.


                                                                      Signed

                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
