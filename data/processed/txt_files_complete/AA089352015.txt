For the Appellant:     Miss Pickering of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwyncz a Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. The respondent refused the appellant's  application  for  asylum  or
       ancillary protection  on  2  June  2015.  His  appeal  against  that
       decision  was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   Simpson
       following a hearing on 19 October 2015. This is  an  appeal  against
       that decision.
    2. The appellant was born on [ ] 1998. He is Vietnamese. At the date of
       hearing he was 17 years and 9 months old. He claimed  to  have  been
       brought up by his uncle when his mother abandoned  him.  He  claimed
       that in September 2014 a gang attacked his home  and  threatened  to
       kill them both unless money was paid. That night his uncle took  him
       to Hanoi and obtained illegal documentation  to  bring  him  to  the
       United Kingdom. He fears that on his return to Vietnam he  would  be
       killed by the gangsters as the money was not paid and  he  would  be
       vulnerable to human trafficking as he has no family or social help.

The grant of permission


    3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Astle granted  permission  to  appeal  (16
       December 2015) on the grounds that;



          1) The Judge should have assessed the risk at the date of hearing,



          2) there is no bright line which says that when a person turns  18
             he ceases to be at risk,

          3) the Judge failed to consider adequately the experts report, and

          4) the Judge failed to reconcile her  finding  that  he  would  be
             homeless and yet it would  not  be  unduly  harsh  for  him  to
             relocate.


Respondent's position

    4. The respondent asserted in her reply (29 December 2015)  in  essence
       that the Judge directed herself appropriately, made findings open to
       her that there was no real risk of  harm  on  return,  and  properly
       considered the experts report. It was submitted orally that children
       who  are  unaccompanied  and  would  have  no   suitable   reception
       arrangements are not removed.


The Judge's findings

    5. The Judge found as follows;


          [13] "The appellant fears loan sharks and  gangsters  in  Vietnam,
          all of whom are non-state agents but none of whom are  threatening
          him, if they are threatening him, because of a Convention  reason.
          Consequently, he cannot succeed in asylum claim under the  Refugee
          Convention."


          [19] "... I bear in mind that the appellant would  not  return  to
          Vietnam until after his 18th birthday and I take the view that  as
          an adult, he would be less vulnerable... Moreover, while I  accept
          that he has no family in Vietnam to turn to for support, there  is
          no reason to believe that he would be particularly  vulnerable  to
          forced  labour  trafficking,  whether  outside  the   country   or
          internally, given that he has received  some  basic  education  in
          United Kingdom and thus will be better placed than many to  obtain
          legitimate employment in Vietnam."


          [20] "Moreover, while there may be a short period of time in which
          he finds it difficult to  obtain  accommodation,  particularly  as
          Vietnam has no shelters or  services  specifically  for  assisting
          male or child victims and none devoted specifically to victims  of
          labour trafficking, there is no reason to believe  that  he  would
          have difficulty obtaining legitimate  employment  in  one  of  the
          major cities e.g a Hanoi or Ho Chi  Minh  City  and  there  is  no
          reason why he cannot  begin  the  process  of  re-registering  his
          residence, if necessary, through the Vietnamese Embassy in London.
          They should certainly be able to advise him if his registration is
          still in place."


          [21] "The  appellant  has  no  known  physical  or  mental  health
          issues..."


Discussion

    6. In relation to ground one,  as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  the
       appellant was a child. He was not an  adult.  He  had  been  granted
       leave  to  remain  as  an  unaccompanied  minor  where  there   were
       inadequate reception arrangements in his own country. The chronology
       within the appellant's bundle identifies his  leave  to  remain  was
       granted until 1 July 2015, namely until he  was  almost  17  ï¿½.  His
       leave would have expired if he  had  not  submitted  an  appeal  and
       further application for permission to appeal. There is no indication
       that the respondent had ever given an undertaking that the appellant
       would not be removed prior to his 18th  birthday.  In  my  judgement
       therefore he should have been assessed as being a child at the  date
       of hearing who was liable to removal. There has been  no  assessment
       as to whether as a child he would be at real risk from  loan  sharks
       or traffickers.  Background  evidence  had  been  produced  and  the
       experts report clearly identified that there was at least  an  issue
       to  be  addressed.  Victims  of  trafficking  can  form  part  of  a
       particular social group  as  the  persecution  is  separate  to  the
       membership of the group. Whilst his claim was not one of a  fear  of
       the state itself but of non-state agents of persecution,  there  was
       no adequate assessment of the availability of state protection  from
       those non-state agents of persecution. The peremptory  dismissal  of
       the asylum claim  without  consideration  of  these  matters  in  my
       judgement was a material error of law.


    7. In relation to ground 2, as identified in  the  application  seeking
       permission to appeal,  the  Judge  has  not  applied  the  principle
       identified in KA (Afghanistan) and others v SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  1014
       regarding the lack of a bright line rule such that once he became 18
       he would not necessarily be at risk due to his  membership  of  that
       particular social group. That in my judgement is a further  material
       error of law.


    8. In relation to ground 3, while the Judge did  consider  the  experts
       report, she did not do so in the context of an asylum claim  from  a
       child without any family support who did not have access to shelters
       or services to help protect him and was based on an assumption  that
       he was an adult which he was not. That in my judgement is a  further
       material error of law.


    9. In relation to ground 4, the Judge found that it would not be unduly
       harsh for him to return. She also found that he would have no family
       and no accommodation shelters or  services  available.  As  a  child
       those findings are  in  my  judgement  irreconcilable.  That  in  my
       judgement is a further material error of law.

   10. I set the decision aside.

   11. Both representatives agreed that in  those  circumstances  I  should
       remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision.

    The matter shall be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  de  novo
    hearing before a Judge other than Judge Simpson.
