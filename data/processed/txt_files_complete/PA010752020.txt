For the Appellant:     Mr Dhokia, Oakmount Law

For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born in 1989.   He  appeals  with
       permission against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
       Ficklin) to  dismiss  his  appeal  on  protection  and  human  rights
       grounds.

    2. Permission was granted by Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Shaerf in limited terms.  Judge Ficklin had dismissed the Appellant's
       claim insofar as it related to an alleged risk of honour killing, and
       sur place online activity; Judge Shaerf found no  arguable  error  in
       those findings. He was however prepared to grant  permission  on  the
       approach  that  Judge  Ficklin  took  to   issues   of   return   and
       documentation.

    3. Judge Ficklin's findings on these matters were as follows [at �34]:

           "There  is  no  evidence  that  the  Appellant  cannot   receive
           assistance from his family to obtain his civil status documents.
           On that basis he can either obtain his CSID at  Baghdad  from  a
           family member  or  an  intermediary  so  he  can  travel  on  to
           Sulaymaniyah, or they can send it to him here in the UK,  or  he
           can  obtain  one  from  the  Consulate  or  Embassy  with  their
           assistance. The Appellant submitted evidence of his visit to the
           Iraqi Consulate in Manchester ... however I find this attempt is
           not genuine because the Appellant has not  exhausted  the  other
           means he has to facilitate the redocumentation process..."

    4. Whilst the Appellant accepts that the Tribunal directed itself to the
       applicable country guidance in SMO, KSP & IM (Article 15(c); identity
       documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 00400 (IAC) it is  submitted  that  in
       reaching  these  findings  it  failed  to  properly  apply  it.    In
       particular it is submitted that the  Tribunal  failed  to  take  into
       account  the  matters  set  out  in  the  relevant  country  guidance
       decision(s) in respect of the difficulties in obtaining documentation
       from the United Kingdom or Baghdad, made no  findings  on  where  the
       Appellant is from, what civil registration system is in  place  there
       and what conditions the Appellant's family may be living in.

    5. The Respondent opposed the appeal. Whilst Mr Bates accepted that some
       of the alternative solutions posited  by  the  Tribunal  may  not  be
       sustainable - in particular the ability of the  Appellant  to  obtain
       documentation here - he submitted that in a situation such  as  this,
       where the Tribunal has found the Appellant  not  to  be  telling  the
       truth about his contact with his family, the Tribunal can  only  make
       findings on the evidence it has. It would be  for  the  Appellant  to
       show that he is unable to be redocumented. No evidence  was  produced
       one way or another about the IDs available in Sulaymaniyah.

       Discussion and Findings

    6. Notwithstanding that he is a former resident of the  IKR  the  First-
       tier Tribunal proceeded on the basis that the  Appellant  was  to  be
       returned to Baghdad, and it is not in issue that it was right  to  do
       so.  The Respondent has, subsequent to the decision in SMO  confirmed
       this to be the case: see the latest Iraq  CPIN,  (published  in  June
       2020) Internal Relocation, Civil Documentation and Returns:

           2.6.29  Previously  the  KRG  (Kurdistan  Regional   Government)
           authorities had responsibility  for  immigration;  this  is  now
           centralised  with  the  authorities  in  Baghdad   deciding   on
           immigration matters for the whole of Iraq. Former  residents  of
           the KRI who do not return voluntarily are returned  to  Baghdad,
           from where they will travel to their destination. Those who  are
           prepared to obtain a travel  document  can  return  to  the  KRI
           voluntarily, to either Erbil or Sulamaniyah, without  having  to
           transit Baghdad (see Returns Logistics information on  the  Iraq
           country page on Horizon and  the  Country  returns  guide  (this
           guide is updated regularly)).

    7. The finding in SMO, as in AAH (Kurds - internal relocation)  Iraq  CG
       [2018] UKUT 00212 (IAC), was that in order  to  get  out  of  Baghdad
       airport the Appellant will need a valid identity document. He  cannot
       use the laissez-passer that he has travelled in on. He needs either a
       CSID or a new biometric identity card - an 'INID' - to  pass  through
       the many checkpoints on the roads, and  would  not  be  permitted  to
       board a domestic flight without one: see section C of the headnote to
       SMO.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal clearly appreciated  that  to  be  the  case,
       since it has framed its findings at its �34 in terms of the Appellant
       needing that card  whilst  still  in  Baghdad.   It  posited  various
       alternative solutions  to  this  logistical  problem.   Two  are  not
       sustainable in light of the findings in SMO.

    9. Where the Tribunal states "he can either obtain his CSID at  Baghdad"
       - this fails to  take  into  account  the  guidance  at  �15  of  the
       headnote: An individual returnee who  is  not  from  Baghdad  is  not
       likely to be  able  to  obtain  a  replacement  document  there,  and
       certainly not within a reasonable time.  Neither the Central  Archive
       nor  the  assistance  facilities  for  IDPs  are  likely  to   render
       documentation assistance to an undocumented returnee.

   10. Where the First-tier Tribunal suggests that he could  obtain  a  CSID
       from the consulate in the United Kingdom the Tribunal fails to reason
       that finding in light of the extensive evidence set out not  only  in
       SMO, but in AAH and indeed AA (Article 15(c))  Iraq  CG  [2015]  UKUT
       00544 (IAC). Each of those country guidance panels found that  whilst
       it was technically possible to obtain new documents from  within  the
       United Kingdom, the bureaucratic obstacles were  such  that  decision
       makers had to give careful consideration to whether it was reasonably
       likely that the returnee would fail to achieve this.  It has been  Dr
       Fatah's consistent evidence that the consular  staff  in  the  United
       Kingdom are not  particularly  interested  or  motivated  in  helping
       undocumented asylum seekers and that applications must  be  supported
       by a panoply of documents,  none  of  which,  it  would  appear,  are
       immediately available to this Appellant. I note that the difficulties
       identified by Dr Fatah, and confirmed by other sources, have latterly
       led the Respondent to conclude that it is "highly  unlikely  that  an
       individual would be able to obtain a  CSID  from  the  Iraqi  Embassy
       while in the United Kingdom" [2.6.16] June 2020 CPIN.

   11. That leaves the First-tier Tribunal's remaining alternatives: that  a
       family member or "intermediary" could get a card  for  the  Appellant
       and either bring it to Baghdad to meet him, or alternatively send  it
       to him here. If the civil registry in Sulaymaniyah is  still  issuing
       CSID cards, those are, on the findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
       certainly options open to the Appellant which would defeat any  claim
       under Article 15(b).  If however Sulaymaniyah  is  now  issuing  only
       biometric INIDs, this option is closed to the Appellant  since  these
       cards can only be issued in person: see headnote  (16)  of  SMO.   In
       those circumstances he must succeed in his appeal.

   12. On first reading I was certainly concerned that the Tribunal does not
       appear to have addressed its mind to these issues. Nowhere  is  there
       any exploration of whether the  civil  registry  in  Sulaymaniyah  is
       operational (see headnote (14) SMO).  Nor is there any  consideration
       of whether the family members left in  Sulaymaniyah  would  be  in  a
       position to assist: see headnote (1)(iii) to  AAH.   Finally,  having
       directed itself to the evidence in SMO about INIDs, the Tribunal  has
       apparently forgotten that the new system has been introduced.   Those
       are certainly difficulties with paragraph 34 of  the  decision.  They
       are  not  however  difficulties  which  would  justify  setting  this
       decision aside. That is because the evidential  burden  lies  on  the
       Appellant, and there was nothing before Judge Ficklin to  assist  him
       with any of these matters. No background evidence was produced  about
       whether identity documents might be available in Sulaymaniyah, and if
       so which ones. As to the Appellant's family he had of  course  denied
       that he had any contact at all, but this had  been  rejected  as  not
       credible :  in that kind of credibility vacuum the judge could not be
       expected to make any assumptions one way or the other  about  whether
       the relatives in Sulaymaniyah were  maternal/paternal  or  documented
       themselves.  Even  if  the  Judge  had  addressed  his  mind  to  the
       questions identified by the country  guidance  cases,  the  Appellant
       would not have been able  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof.   It
       follows that the errors  in  the  decision  are  not  such  that  the
       decision should be set aside.




       Anonymity Order

   13. The Appellant continues to seek international protection. Having  had
       regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
       2008 and the Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity
       Orders I therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the
       following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




       Decisions

   14. The appeal is dismissed.

   15. There is an order for anonymity.
