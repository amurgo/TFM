                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Saffer promulgated on the 11th December 2018 whereby the
    judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse the appellant entry clearance to  the  UK  as  the
    spouse of a person present and settled in the UK under the  Immigration
    Rules, specifically Appendix FM. The  appellant  appealed  against  the
    decision on the basis that it breached his and his spouse's  Article  8
    right to family life.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

 3. Leave to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Landes on 14th January  2019.  Thus  the  case  appeared
    before me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law
    in the decision.

    Chronology of material events

 4. The appellant made an application on 6 October 2016 for entry clearance
    to  the  United  Kingdom  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  specifically
    appendix FM as the spouse of Maryum Ali, the sponsor herein, and on the
    basis of Article 8 of the ECHR.

 5. At  the  time  of  the  application  the  sponsor  was  working  for  2
    businesses, one of which was Haji's Halal meat. She worked  for  Haji's
    Halal meat as a "sales assistant" on a part-time basis. The sponsor had
    allegedly been working for the business since 4 April 2016.

 6. Much though it is not mentioned to any significant extent the appellant
    was also working for ECON Restaurants  Ltd  [McDonalds].  There  is  an
    employer's letter confirming that she had started working for McDonalds
    in July 2008.

 7. In order to meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM the  sponsor
    had to be earning �18,600. The evidence from HMRC  discloses  that  the
    sponsor working for ECON Restaurants Ltd had earned �15,159 to the  5th
    April 2016 and to 5 April 2017 had earned �15,137. It was the shortfall
    between those earnings and the financial requirements of the rules that
    was to be met by the income from Haji's Halal Meat. It  appears  to  be
    accepted that the sponsor was at the time of  the  application  earning
    sufficient to meet  the  rules  from  the  earnings  in  the  two  jobs
    identified.

 8. On 17 February  2017,  nearly  6  months  after  the  application,  the
    respondent checked the claimed employment with Haji's Halal  meat.  The
    proprietor stated that the sponsor no longer worked  for  the  business
    and had ceased employment in December 2016. The proprietor did not know
    the date that the appellant had started work with the business.

 9. Further information was requested and it was confirmed  that  only  one
    person was employed by the business, at the time of checking,  and  the
    duties of such an individual were basic and did not justify the  salary
    that the sponsor had  claimed.  The  employment  did  not  require  any
    specific expertise. It is unclear whether or  not  the  proprietor  was
    asked what the sponsor had earned in the time that she had been working
    or whether any checks have been conducted with HMRC.

10. It appears that the  respondent  sought  to  contact  the  sponsor  but
    telephone calls to her mobile number were  unanswered.  The  respondent
    was seeking to contact the sponsor in late February 2017. According  to
    the evidence given the sponsor was visiting her husband, the appellant,
    in Pakistan between 13 February 2017 and 22 May 2017. The sponsor  gave
    evidence that she had noted telephone  calls  from  the  UK  whilst  in
    Pakistan but as no number had been left, she had been unable to contact
    the persons calling.

11. On 10 August 2017 the appellant's application for entry  clearance  was
    refused on the basis that the appellant  did  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM E-ECP.3.1-3.4. In effect the  ECO  was  not
    satisfied at the date of the decision that the sponsor was earning  the
    income level of �18.600 to meet the requirements of the  rules.   There
    was no other reason given for refusing the application.

12. The appellant appealed against the decision. The appeal was  listed  to
    be heard on 17 October 2018.

13. By the time of the hearing the sponsor had returned from  Pakistan  and
    had resumed working in both businesses. The business Haji's Halal  Meat
    had been taken over. The sponsor was again working  for  two  employers
    and was again earning over  �18,600.  On  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    submitted it was accepted that the sponsor was  earning  sufficient  to
    meet the requirements of the rules.

14. I note within the  grounds  of  appeal  that  it  is  argued  that  the
    appellant only needed to meet the requirements of the rules at the time
    of the application. As the appellant met the rules at the time  of  the
    application it is sought to be argued  that  the  appeal  ought  to  be
    allowed upon that basis

15. In that respect I draw attention to Rule 27 of  the  Immigration  Rules
    the material parts of which provide:

         '27      An application for entry clearance is  to  be  decided  in
         light of the circumstances existing at the  time  of  the  decision
         ...'

16. The sole saving from  that  is  where  an  individual  having  made  an
    application whilst under 18 attains 18 before a decision is made.  That
    saving does not apply to the present  circumstances.  Consideration  of
    the appellant's application under the Immigration Rules had to be based
    upon the facts in existence at the date decision. At the  date  of  the
    decision the appellant did not meet the requirements of the rules.

17. The leave granted raises the issue that the appeal is under  Article  8
    and  that  Article  8  family  life  and  proportionality  have  to  be
    determined at the date of the hearing.

18. What is being submitted is that as  the  appeal  is  being  brought  on
    Article 8 grounds the issue should be whether or not  consideration  of
    proportionality should be at the date of  hearing  where  an  appellant
    although not meeting the rules at the  date  of  the  decision  by  the
    respondent, met them at the date of application  and  at  the  date  of
    hearing before the Tribunal.

19. In part the reason, for not  meeting  the  rule  at  the  date  of  the
    decision, was the delay of the respondent. If the application had  been
    decided within a reasonable time  of  several  days  or  a  month,  the
    appellant and sponsor would have met the Immigration Rules.

20. Mr McVitie on behalf of the respondent accepted that the appellant  and
    sponsor met the requirements of the rules at the  time  of  application
    and for at least two months thereafter.  Mr Mc Vitie also accepted that
    the appellant and sponsor at the time of  the  hearing  again  met  the
    requirements of the rules. Mr McVitie also accepted that the  delay  on
    the part of the respondent had resulted in the  sponsor  travelling  to
    Pakistan to visit her husband, the appellant.

21. Mr McVitie did not oppose  the  appeal.  He  accepted  taking  all  the
    circumstances together that this was a genuine marital relationship and
    that the decision interfered with that relationship. He accepted  that,
    whilst the decision was in accordance with the law and for the purposes
    of maintaining immigration control as an aspect of the  economic  well-
    being of  the  country,  taking  all  the  circumstances  into  account
    including the fact there was delay on the part  of  the  respondent  to
    deal with the appellant's application with reasonable expedition  which
    brought about the appellant no longer meeting the requirements  of  the
    rules for a period of time, it was  not  proportionately  justified  to
    refuse the appellant's application.

22. Mr McVitie made the point that the result of  maintaining  the  present
    decision would mean that all the  appellant  had  to  do  was  to  make
    another application and that that application would  be  successful  in
    the circumstances. Given that that application would be  successful  Mr
    McVitie conceded that it could not be said that  the  present  decision
    was proportionately justified taking all those factors into account.

23. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Ahmed had nothing to add.

24. As Mr McVitie has conceded that there is a material error  of  law  and
    accepts on the evidence that the appeal  should  be  allowed,  for  the
    reasons set out I rule  there  is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision. On the basis of the concessions made I set the decision aside
    and substituted decision allowing the appeal.

    Notice of Decision

25. I set aside the original decision and substituted a  decision  allowing
    the appeal.
