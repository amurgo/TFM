Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwnycz, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T Hussain, instructed by Patel & Bhatoa,
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent, Ghoutam Das, was born on  1  November  1974  and  is  a
    citizen of India.  I shall hereafter refer  to  the  appellant  as  the
    respondent and to  the  respondent  as  the  appellant  (as  they  were
    respectively before the First-tier Tribunal).

 2. The appellant applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as  the
    spouse of a  person  present  and  settled  in  this  country  but  his
    application was refused on 3 January 2013.  The appellant  appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Hindson)  which,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 8 January 2014, allowed the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules.  The Entry Clearance Officer now appeals,  with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer's notice of refusal records that the United
    Kingdom sponsor had an annual income of �11381.76 which was  below  the
    required gross income of �18600 per annum.  The refusal notice reads:

         The guidance (5.3.1) states to work out a sponsor's salary you need
         to take the lowest level of her salary  of  the  most  current  six
         months' salary slips that have been submitted.  In your wife's case
         this is �948.48 (04/2012), to get  your  wife's  yearly  income  we
         multiply this by 12.  According to this your wife's  annual  income
         would be �11381.76.

 4. Judge Hindson [15] asked the Presenting Officer to explain to him  what
    was meant by the expression "Guidance 5.3.1"  but  she  was  unable  to
    assist.  The judge  appears  to  have  concluded  that  this  guidance,
    whatever it may constitute, did not form a "statement of the  law"  and
    that he was not in any way bound by it.  The judge then set out in  his
    determination what he understood to be the  relevant  Immigration  Rule
    and concluded that the sponsor had an income of  �19094.40  per  annum.
    That calculation was based upon the monthly salary  which  the  sponsor
    had  received  throughout  the  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the
    application; her salary had increased during that period.

 5. The respondent  now  asserts  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
    applying the relevant Rule  which  appears  at  paragraph  13(a)(i)  of
    Appendix FM-SE:

         (a)  where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at  the
             date of application and has  been  employed  by  that  current
             employer for at least six months, their  gross  annual  income
             will be a total of:

             (i)  the gross annual salary from their employment as  it  was
                  at its lowest level in the six months prior to the date of
                  application.

 6. Mr Hussain, who appeared  for  the  appellant  at  the  Upper  Tribunal
    hearing, did not seem to persuade me that paragraph  13(a)(i)  was  not
    the Rule  which  applies  in  this  instance.   I  make  the  following
    observations: (i) Paragraph 13(a)(i) is not well expressed but, on  its
    proper construction, I find that it must have the meaning given  to  it
    by the ECO, namely that, where a sponsor produces six salary slips over
    a period of  six  months,  then  the  annual  gross  salary  should  be
    calculated by reference to the lowest wage figure shown on any  of  the
    salary slips;  (ii) Judge Hindson was not assisted  by  the  mysterious
    reference in the refusal notice "Guidance 5.3.1", which neither the ECO
    nor the Presenting Officer could explain satisfactorily to  the  judge.
    However, the reference to the  guidance  is  nugatory  given  that  the
    requirement appears in the Immigration Rule; (iii) Any analysis of  the
    spouse's annual gross income by reference  to  these  principles  would
    show that her income fell below the required figure of �18600; (iv)  It
    follows that the appeal should have been dismissed by Judge Hindson.

 7. It may well be the case that the sponsor, who enjoys  a  higher  salary
    now than at the time of  the  appellant's  last  application,  may  now
    satisfy the Rules and the appellant will,  no  doubt,  make  a  further
    application to the ECO, if so advised.

    DECISION

    I find that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal should be  set
    aside.  I have remade the decision.  The appeal against the immigration
    decision dated 3 January 2013 is dismissed.
