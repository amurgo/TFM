Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Smart - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent: No appearance.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Colyer  promulgated  on  10th  December  2013  following  his
        considering the merits of the appeal on the papers.   Judge  Colyer
        dismissed the appeal in respect of the  Tier  4  (General)  Student
        Migrant element of the case but allowed the appeal  in  respect  of
        the Secretary of State's decision  to  remove  Mr  Malik  from  the
        United Kingdom pursuant to a removal direction issued under section
        47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


     2. In relation to this element the Judge refers to written submissions
        containing case law relevant to section 47 and refers to  a  recent
        practice of Home Office Presenting Officers to withdraw section  47
        directions at the hearing.  The appeal was determined on the papers
        and in paragraph 12 Judge Colyer states "I follow the case  law  on
        this particular point and find that part of the decision is not  in
        accordance with the law and on that point only I allow the appeal".


     3. The Secretary of State challenges that  element  of  the  decision.
        There is no cross-appeal by Mr Malik in relation to  the  dismissal
        of his claim under the Immigration Rules.



Discussion



     4. Judge Colyer noted the existence of case law relating to section 47
        and the previous practice of some Presenting  Officer  to  withdraw
        such decisions at hearings. Cases such as Ahmadi (s.  47  decision:
        validity; Sapkota) [2012] UKUT 00147 (IAC) and Adamally and  Jaferi
        (section 47 removal decisions:  Tribunal  Procedures)  [2012]  UKUT
        00414 (IAC) have found that the statutory provisions prevented  the
        Secretary of State issuing a removal direction at the same time  as
        a decision on an application to  vary  leave  to  appeal  with  the
        effect  that  any  decision  made  contemporaneously  was  'not  in
        accordance with the law'.


     5. The Secretary  of  State  unsuccessfully  challenged  the  Tribunal
        decisions before the Court of Appeal in relation  to  this  element
        whilst at the same time laying before Parliament  an  amendment  to
        section 47 which resolved the issue.  Section 51 of the  Crime  and
        Courts Act 2013 substituted a new sections 47 (1) and (1A) into the
        Nationality and Immigration Act 2006 from 8 May 2013  -  see  Crime
        and Courts Act 2013 (Commencement no 1) Order (SI 2013/1042).   The
        amendment to s.47 is  not  retrospective  but  from  8th  May  2013
        removal decisions made under s.47  will  be  lawful  even  it  made
        before the applicant has notice of the  variation  decision.   This
        means that notice of the two decisions can be  given  in  the  same
        document.


     6. The Commencement Order contains no transitional provisions relating
        to decisions made on applications filed prior to that date and  has
        immediate effect in relation to all section 47 directions  made  on
        or after 8th May 2013.  The decision under appeal is dated the  3rd
        July 2013 which  is  after  this  date.   Accordingly  the  removal
        direction made under section 47 was lawful.


     7. I find the Judge erred in law in allowing the appeal in relation to
        the  section  47  removal   direction   based   upon   a   material
        misdirection/misunderstanding of the law. I set  the  determination
        aside. The finding in relation to the  inability  of  Mr  Malik  to
        satisfy  the  Tier  4  (General)  Student   requirements   of   the
        Immigration Rules shall stand. I substitute a decision  to  dismiss
        the appeal.

Decision

     8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


     9. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order as there is no application of  anonymity
        and the making of such an order is not justified on the facts.
