                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr J Rene (counsel for Toltops Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 13 July 2018 allowing the appeal of Yamuna
       Hiroshimala Mawattha Widanalage, a  citizen  of  Sri  Lanka  born  11
       September 1986, itself brought against the refusal of a human  rights
       claim of 12 March 2018.


    2. The immigration history provided for the Respondent is that  she  was
       granted leave to enter as a student on 18 October  2010,  that  being
       extended until 19  October  2015;  she  was  served  with  notice  of
       removability on 15  September  2014  (which,  if  the  chronology  is
       accurate, would imply that her leave had by then been curtailed)  and
       applied for leave outside the Rules on 16 October 2015.  On  22  June
       2016 she made the application leading  to  the  present  proceedings,
       based on her relationship with her Sponsor Janaka Mudiyanselage.

    3. Ms  Widanalage's  application  for  leave  was  refused  on  "general
       refusal" grounds on the basis that her English language test  results
       on 19 March 2013 at New London College had been procured dishonestly,
       a conclusion to which the  Secretary  of  State  had  come  following
       information received from the testing body, ETS. The  decision  maker
       did not accept any exceptional circumstances  were  present,  because
       she would not face unjustifiably harsh consequences in Sri Lanka:  it
       was not accepted she would face any  significant  shame  due  to  her
       family's attitude towards her, and in  any  event  such  difficulties
       should be advanced via an asylum claim if at all.

    4. The Appellant provided evidence of English language  proficiency  via
       various other certificates and achievements: an  IELTS  result  which
       she believed to be 5.0 before travelling to the UK, and  her  studies
       in English: a  BSC  in  Information  Technology  in  2011/2012,  ACCA
       examinations thereafter, a Masters in Marketing and  Innovation  from
       Anglia Ruskin University.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal gave a very full decision on the  appeal.  It
       noted the evidence given in SM and Qadir as  to  the  search  of  New
       London College's Directors' home addresses in  July  2014  which  had
       produced the names of candidates who had engaged proxy  testers,  and
       the latter's identity. There was no such  evidence  produced  in  the
       instant appeal and there was no evidence of the rates  of  invalidity
       identified at the relevant time the Appellant sat her test.

    6. The Judge then went on  to  accept  that  the  generic  evidence  put
       forward by the Secretary of State was  sufficient  to  discharge  the
       initial burden of proof to put the Appellant's credibility in  issue.
       He then examined the rebuttal evidence of Ms Widanalage and found  it
       wanting in a number of respects.

    7. Then the Judge returned to an analysis of the  Secretary  of  State's
       evidence. It found that the weaknesses identified by the Tribunal vis-
       �-vis the Home  Office  case  in  the  earlier  authorities  remained
       relevant here, including a  lack  of  witness  statements  evidencing
       relevant assertions, the generic nature of those statements that were
       provided, the lack of evidence of any comparison of speech and speech
       patterns of Ms Widanalage and the alleged proxy, or  indeed  analysis
       of Ms Widanalage's voice record, and the lack of any  explanation  of
       how it was that  a proxy had been identified in this particular case.
       There was  no  evidence  from  an  appropriately  qualified  acoustic
       engineer who had been able to analyse an appropriate  sample  of  ETS
       decisions and who might  foreseeably  have  been  able  to  devise  a
       suitable test to check the testing system's  probity.  Absent  cogent
       evidence such as this, it was not legitimate, satisfactory or fair to
       find that Ms Widanalage had engaged in fraud, even though  the  Judge
       identified some concerns with her oral evidence and  noted  that  the
       qualifications that  she  put  forwards  did  not  clearly  establish
       English language proficiency at the level claimed.


    8. Thus the Tribunal below concluded that the Secretary of State had not
       established that the general refusal reason was made out.  That  left
       Ms Widanalage's substantive ground of appeal  to  determine,  ie  the
       merits of her human rights claim based on her relationship  with  her
       husband, which he accepted was a  genuine  and  subsisting  one.  The
       Judge did not accept that her parents would  insist  that  she  lived
       with them in the future, and so they would not be in  a  position  to
       prevent her from pursuing her current relationship. Nor did he accept
       that they would face insurmountable obstacles to life in Sri Lanka, a
       country which was now generally at peace and in which they  had  both
       lived for much of their lives and where her husband could  presumably
       find work.

    9. The Judge noted the submission put to him that he should consider the
       case  under  the  five-year  route  which   did   not   require   the
       identification of insurmountable obstacles, but found that  this  was
       effectively a new matter that required the Home Office's  consent  to
       advance; and before him, consent was expressly denied. In any  event,
       inadequate "specified evidence" was  before  him  to  make  good  the
       claimed earnings.

   10.  However,  he  did  accept  that  there  were   unjustifiably   harsh
       consequences in play, because the Appellant was party  to  a  genuine
       relationship that had now exceeded four  years  in  duration  over  a
       period  during  which  she  enjoyed   valid   leave.   The   backstop
       consideration in  Article  8  appeals  was  essentially  whether  the
       refusal  was  disproportionate.  The  Tribunal  concluded  that   the
       decision here was indeed disproportionate,  given  that  it  was  the
       wrongful belief in the use of  a  proxy  tester  that  had  primarily
       motivated the decision to refuse her.  Furthermore,  additional  time
       and expense would be  incurred  by  a  repeat  application,  and  the
       Sponsor might well lose his job in the  meantime  so  preventing  the
       couple from meeting the Rules by the time an application from  abroad
       was feasible. Thus there was no  sensible  reason  to  justify  their
       return to Sri Lanka.

   11. The Secretary of State appealed on the basis that

      a) Vis-�-vis the general refusal reason based on English language
         fraud:


          - The First-tier Tribunal should have found on the basis of
            Professor French's evidence that the ETS identification of
            fraud was reliable;


          - No consideration was given to issues such as the Appellant's
            recollection of events on the day of the test;


          - An "impermissibly high standard of proof" had been applied;


      b) As to the substantive appeal, the section 117B factors had been
         overlooked.

   12. Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  22
       August 2018 on the basis that all those grounds were arguable.


   13. Before me, Mr Jarvis concentrated his submissions on the  overlooking
       of the statutory proportionality factors under section  117B  of  the
       Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and the  approach  taken
       to the evidence of English language testing fraud. As to the  latter,
       he argued that this was a case  where  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       erred in law by failing to appreciate that,  having  found  the  Home
       Office  had  discharged  the  burden  of  proof  so  as  to  put   Ms
       Widanalage's credibility in issue, it was then necessary to  evaluate
       whether the evidence provided  by  her  rebutted  the  allegation  of
       fraud.  A  series  of  well  known  Upper  Tribunal  authorities  had
       demonstrated that the Home Office case required  reasoned  engagement
       by a migrant accused of English language test fraud following an  ETS
       investigation. However here, in reality, the Judge had found that the
       very same material which had been repeatedly  accepted  as  requiring
       such engagement simply did not  get  off  the  ground  as  a  tenable
       deception allegation.

Findings and reasons

   14. It will be helpful to the next Judge to confront this appeal  to  set
       out some of the well-trodden ground in relation to  English  language
       test fraud allegations. The President explains in Muhandiramge [2015]
       UKUT 675 (IAC), that  decisions  in  General  Refusal  reasons  cases
       involve a "moderately complex  exercise"  in  which  "the  evidential
       pendulum swings three times and in three  different  directions".  To
       quote further from that decision:

           "(a) First,  where  the  Secretary  of  State  alleges  that  an
           applicant  has  practised  dishonesty   or   deception   in   an
           application for leave to remain, there is an  evidential  burden
           on  the  Secretary  of  State.  This  requires  that  sufficient
           evidence be adduced to raise an issue as to the existence or non-
           existence of a fact in issue:  for  example,  by  producing  the
           completed application which is prima  facie  deceitful  in  some
           material fashion.


           (b) The spotlight thereby  switches  to  the  applicant.  If  he
           discharges the burden - again, an evidential one - of raising an
           innocent explanation, namely  an  account  which  satisfies  the
           minimum level of plausibility, a further transfer of the  burden
           of proof occurs.


           (c) Where (b) is satisfied, the burden rests on the Secretary of
           State to establish, on the balance of  probabilities,  that  the
           Appellant's prima facie innocent explanation is to be rejected.


           A veritable burden of proof boomerang!"

   15. The Upper Tribunal cites  expert  evidence  deployed  by  a  litigant
       seeking to cast doubt upon the validity testing process used  by  ETS
       in Gazi (IJR) [2015] UKUT 327 (IAC):

           "Dr Harrison  also  examines,  with  accompanying  critique  and
           commentary,   the   discrete   issues   of   factors   affecting
           performance; the typical performance of human verification;  the
           definition of thresholds; the explicit acknowledgement of  human
           errors; the lack of testing of the performance of analysts;  the
           dubious touchstone of "confidence" (see Mr Millington's  witness
           statement); the dearth of information about the actual  analysis
           methodology;  the  lack  of  detail  about  the  experience  and
           knowledge of both the recruited analysts and their  supervisors;
           the indication that any training of the newly recruited analysts
           was  hurried;  the  shortcomings  in  Mr   Millington's   speech
           recognition averments; and the clear acknowledgement on the part
           of ETS that false identifications (viz false  positive  results)
           have occurred. One passage relating to  the  human  verification
           process is especially noteworthy:


                 "... although the analysts only verified matches where they
                 had no doubt about their validity  -  ie  where  they  were
                 certain about their judgments - this should not be taken as
                 a reliable indicator of the accuracy  of  those  judgments.
                 This approach does not remove the risk  of  false  positive
                 results."


           Dr Harrison also highlights that both the automatic  system  and
           the human analysts are capable of  false  positive  errors.  The
           Secretary of State's  evidence  does  not  disclose  either  the
           percentage or the volume of such errors."

   16. No findings were made on  that  evidence  in  Gazi.  However  in  the
       subsequent appeal of Qadir [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC) the  Upper  Tribunal
       concluded that the Home Office evidence had significant shortcomings,
       in particular at [63], a lack of qualifications or expertise  of  the
       officials who visited ETS and produced witness  statements  based  on
       their visit to ETS, during which ETS was  the  sole  arbiter  of  the
       information  disclosed  and  assertions  made,  undue   Home   Office
       dependency on the information from ETS when ETS had  put  forward  no
       witness or indeed any other evidence whatsoever  of  their  own,  the
       lack of any expert evidence backing up the opinion of the  staff  who
       visited ETS, and the fact that voice recording files had  never  been
       put forward pertaining to the appellants themselves. Accordingly  the
       Tribunal accepted that the methods used by ETS were  not  necessarily
       guaranteed to avoid the occasional false positive whereby an innocent
       student is wrongly identified as having cheated in their test.


   17. In MA (Nigeria) [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal stated that

           "we acknowledge the suggestion that the Appellant had no reason
           to engage in the deception which we have found proven. However,
           this has not deflected us in any way from reaching our main
           findings and conclusions. In the abstract, of course, there is a
           range of reasons why persons proficient in English may engage in
           TOEIC fraud. These include, inexhaustively, lack of confidence,
           fear of failure, lack of time and commitment and contempt for
           the immigration system. These reasons could conceivably overlap
           in individual cases and there is scope for other explanations
           for deceitful conduct in this sphere."

   18. As noted by the Tribunal in Nawaz [2017] UKUT 288 (IAC), the training
       by ETS for its staff called to  assist  in  the  programme  reviewing
       potentially suspect tests fell well short of  what  would  have  been
       received by an expert language analyst; however they were trained  in
       relevant areas, and this was not  an  exclusively  technical  subject
       area in which  only  true  experts  could  perform  to  a  reasonably
       reliable standard. Their lack of note-taking, at least  in  any  form
       available for subsequent analysis, was one deficiency that would need
       to be factored into judicial decisions. Professor  French's  evidence
       recognised that false positives could occur in  the  review  process,
       albeit that in his opinion at a significantly lesser level than might
       have been inferred from the earlier criticisms of ETS's processes  in
       Gazi and Qadir.


  Error of law regarding evaluation of Secretary of State's evidence


   19. This line of authority clearly establishes a number  of  proposition.
       Firstly, whilst the ultimate legal burden of proof  rests  firmly  on
       the Secretary of State throughout a General Refusal  allegation,  the
       evidential pendulum may swing between the parties. Secondly, as shown
       by Gazi and Qadir, there  are  numerous  problems  with  the  generic
       evidence relied on by the Secretary of State,  such  that  individual
       challenges  may  succeed  in  overturning  the   decision   appealed,
       notwithstanding the fact that the Home Office has  chosen  to  accept
       the result of the ETS enquiry. Thirdly, a  migrant  accused  of  such
       fraud will need to put forward an evidence-backed case  in  order  to
       rebut the prima facie suspicion that  the  ETS  enquiry  has  raised.
       Fourthly, the most recent evidence relied upon by  the  Secretary  of
       State, from Professor French, indicates that the identified flaws  in
       the ETS methodology are foreseeably relatively rare. Thus  a  migrant
       accused of ETS fraud must put forward cogent and persuasive  material
       before it can be accepted that their evidence-backed case is truly of
       the substance  required  to  seriously  challenge  the  Secretary  of
       State's ability to discharge the ultimate burden.

   20. In this appeal, despite the detailed consideration  it  gave  to  the
       issue, the First-tier Tribunal went astray. It was  correct  to  find
       that the material relied upon by the Secretary of State constituted a
       prima facie case for Ms Widanalage to answer. However, it then  found
       that  her  responses  were  unpersuasive.   If   her   answers   were
       unpersuasive, then the Secretary of State should have  been  accepted
       as having discharged the ultimate as well as the initial burden  that
       was upon him. Instead, however, the Judge concluded that  the  nature
       of the evidence relied upon was simply insufficient to discharge  the
       ultimate burden. That conclusion ran flatly contrary to  the  various
       authorities cited above, which demonstrate that these cases are to be
       determined via an evaluation of the appropriate evidence, not  simply
       via any presumption as to the general inadequacy of the  Home  Office
       case.

   21. I note Mr  Rene's  reference  to  Ms  Widanalage  having  given  oral
       evidence below on the issues identified in cases such as MA (Nigeria)
       as being relevant to the proper conduct of the enquiry  in  hand;  Mr
       Jarvis did not challenge this assertion. This aspect of her  evidence
       escaped the First-tier Tribunal's attention. Were  it  not  for  this
       feature of the case, this appeal might  have  fallen  to  be  allowed
       outright in the Secretary of State's favour.

   22. However, as that evidence seems to have been overlooked, and  as  the
       Judge directed his attention to  the  wrong  issues,  and  given  the
       importance of a lawful assessment of a person's honesty, this  matter
       must be re-heard.

The Chikwamba principle

   23. As the question of whether the Secretary  of  State  has  established
       that Ms Widanalage acted dishonestly awaits lawful determination, the
       appropriate weight to be given the public interest in  her  departure
       from the UK remains moot. So it is unnecessary to comment on the Home
       Office  grounds  of   appeal   vis-�-vis   section   117B,   as   the
       proportionality balance will be heavily influenced by the  result  of
       that enquiry. Given the arguments that have so  far  emerged  in  the
       appeal, it is expedient to make some observations.

   24. The Judge below was impressed by the  so-called  Chikwamba  argument.
       Before me Mr Jarvis contended that the  public  policy  position  had
       fundamentally  changed  in  recent  years  via  the  introduction  of
       Appendix FM. However, over time decisions such as Hayat  [2012]  EWCA
       Civ 1054, Chen (IJR) [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC) and Kaur [2018]  EWCA  Civ
       1423 show that Chikwamba thinking remains pertinent. Those  decisions
       all demonstrate that there needs  to  be  some  a  "sensible  reason"
       present before a family is  forced  to  separate  for  a  significant
       period in order to enforce  the  procedural  norm  of  seeking  entry
       clearance from abroad. Indeed Sales LJ  in  Agyarko  considered  this
       scenario �31:

           "It is possible to envisage a Chikwamba  type  case  arising  in
           which Article 8 might require that leave to  remain  be  granted
           outside the Rules, even though it could not be said  that  there
           were insurmountable obstacles to the applicant and their  spouse
           or partner continuing their family life overseas. But in a  case
           involving precarious family  life,  it  would  be  necessary  to
           establish that there were exceptional circumstances  to  warrant
           such a conclusion."

   25. Where the application presently being refused is  identical  to  that
       which might be made from  abroad,  then  it  will  be  all  the  more
       appropriate to finally determine the issue via  the  present,  rather
       than some future, proceedings. See Hickinbottom LJ  in  Tikka  [2018]
       EWCA Civ 642 �25-26:

           "The Secretary of State has already considered her discretion in
           that regard, and determined that the Appellant should not remain
           in the United Kingdom. There is no reason to  suppose  that,  on
           the same material and  applying  the  same  criteria,  an  Entry
           Clearance Officer on her behalf will come to a  different  view;
           indeed, there is every reason to consider that he will  come  to
           the same view. That refusal will be the  subject  of  an  appeal
           that will raise exactly the same issues as  the  appeal  to  the
           tribunal in this case, i.e. whether the  interference  with  the
           article 8 rights of the Appellant and his wife that a  permanent
           separation  would  entail  is  justified  ...  That   ...   only
           underscores the  futility  of  removing  the  Appellant  without
           determining, once and for all, the underlying  article  8  issue
           ..."

   26. In the proceedings below, Ms Widanalage sought to raise the  argument
       that she now met the Immigration Rules for the "five year" route - ie
       that she satisfied the full financial requirements  by  the  relevant
       specified evidence. The Judge considered that this was a "new matter"
       (having regard to section 85 of NIAA 2002)  which  required  consent;
       and as none was forthcoming, he declined jurisdiction to consider the
       issue directly. However, he subsequently  went  on  to  consider  the
       Appellant's earnings indirectly, as her ability to meet the financial
       requirements was relevant to his conclusion on the Chikwamba point.


   27. The Upper Tribunal has considered the proper interpretation  of  sub-
       sections 85(5)-(6) in Mahmud [2017]  UKUT  488  (IAC).  The  headnote
       states:

           "2. A 'new matter' is a matter which  constitutes  a  ground  of
           appeal of a kind listed in section 84, as  required  by  section
           85(6)(a) of the 2002 Act.  Constituting a ground of appeal means
           that it must contain a matter which could raise or  establish  a
           listed ground of appeal.  A matter is the factual substance of a
           claim.  A ground of appeal is the legal basis on which the facts
           in any given matter could form the basis of a challenge  to  the
           decision under appeal.


           3. In practice, a new matter is a factual matrix which  has  not
           previously been considered by the  Secretary  of  State  in  the
           context of the decision in section 82(1) or a statement made  by
           the appellant under section 120.  This requires the matter to be
           factually distinct from that previously raised by an  appellant,
           as opposed to further or better evidence of an existing  matter.
           The assessment will always be fact sensitive."

   28. As I understand the history leading to this appeal, the Appellant was
       an overstayer when she applied for leave to remain.  Accordingly  she
       was excluded from qualification  from  the  five-year  Partner  route
       under Appendix FM. She had  to  put  a  case  for  meeting  the  Ex.1
       exception  on  "insurmountable  obstacles"  grounds.  Where  Ex.1  is
       satisfied, it is unnecessary to meet the financial  requirements,  so
       one would not have expected her to put a case that she  did  in  fact
       meet those requirements at the relevant date (ie the  period  leading
       up to the date of application).


   29. It would therefore seem likely that any claim that in  fact  she  met
       the financial requirements would indeed be "a  factual  matrix  which
       has not previously been considered by the Secretary of State".

   30. However, if her argument is simply that she met the  spirit,  if  not
       the  letter,  of  the  Rules  because  she  had  sufficient  earnings
       available at the date of hearing rather than  the  application  date,
       then of course section 117B NIAA 2002 requires that the  question  of
       financial independence be considered as part of  the  proportionality
       exercise, and the Chikwamba enquiry necessarily posits  the  question
       as to whether she would be able to satisfy the Rules in  the  future,
       not simply in the past. One can then see an argument that this is not
       a "new matter": rather it is just one facet of the case  outside  the
       Rules that was originally put to the Secretary of State and rejected.



   31. The Secretary of State could usefully assist in cutting this  Gordian
       knot, to avoid unnecessary argument and uncertainty, by given serious
       consideration to consenting to the question of the available earnings
       and whether they meet the financial requirements now being raised  in
       advance of the re-hearing in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Indeed  the
       published Home Office Guidance on the  giving  of  consent  indicates
       that all issues should be  considered  in  a  single  set  of  appeal
       proceedings where that is reasonably achievable. It is  difficult  to
       see that the Chikwamba enquiry can otherwise be given the effect that
       the authorities require. It is not for the  Upper  Tribunal  to  make
       directions for  case  management  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  but
       consideration should nevertheless be given to this possibility by the
       parties.


  Conclusion


   32. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error  of
       law.  As there are no lawful relevant findings upon which  to  build,
       the matter is suitable for re-hearing in the First-tier  Tribunal.  I
       accordingly  remit  the  appeal  to  that  forum  with  no   findings
       preserved.

          Decision:

    The  appeal  is  remitted  for  re-hearing  afresh  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Signed:                                            Date: 23 October 2018
