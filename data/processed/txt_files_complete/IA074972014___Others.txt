Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr C Amgbah, instructed by UK Law Associates
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Rosemary Oghenewaire Nwokolo, date of  birth  16.12.76,
    Sophia Chisom Nwokolo, date of birth 2.10.02, and  Roy  David  Chibuike
    Nwokolo, date of birth 8.6.07, are citizens of Nigeria.

 2. These are their linked appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Taylor promulgated  23.5.14,  dismissing  their  appeals
    against the decisions of the respondent, dated 27.1.14, to  refuse  the
    first appellant's application  made  on  5.8.13  for  a  permanent  EEA
    residence card on the basis of a retained right of  residence  pursuant
    to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, and the related applications
    of the child appellants. The Judge heard the appeal on 9.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge McWilliam granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    11.6.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Taylor should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  briefly  summarised  as
    follows. On 27.11.08 the first appellant was issued a residence card as
    the spouse of Mr Maxime Sylva.  They  were  divorced  on  15.7.13.  The
    appellant claims a retained right of residence under regulation 10  and
    applied for a permanent residence card under regulation  15,  based  on
    her own  five  years  residence  as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA  national
    exercising Treaty rights prior to the date of the divorce.

 7. For the reasons set out briefly below, I find that there was  no  error
    of law in the determination of Judge Taylor.  The  grounds  are  poorly
    drafted,  confused  and  misguided  and   the   grant   of   permission
    misunderstands the regulations. At the hearing, Mr Amgbah also appeared
    unable to understand the  regulations.  For  example,  at  �10  of  the
    grounds it is  suggested  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  seeking
    evidence that the former husband had  exercised  Treaty  rights  for  a
    continuous period of 5 years. That is not correct. The grounds  and  Mr
    Amgbah's submissions failed to appreciate or comprehend that  in  order
    to qualify for a permanent right of residence, the first appellant  has
    to show that  she  has  completed  a  five-year  continuous  period  of
    residence in accordance with the regulations.

 8. At �10 of the determination Judge Taylor found that the first appellant
    had a retained right of residence following the  divorce  in  2013,  in
    that her former husband had been a qualified  person  at  the  date  of
    divorce, that he was residing in the UK at that time, that the marriage
    had lasted at least 3 years and that the parties had resided in the  UK
    for at least one year during the duration of the marriage (10(5)).  The
    judge also found that the first appellant  met  the  requirement  under
    regulation 10(6).

 9. However, at �6 the judge found that the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements regulation 15(1)(b) for a permanent  right  of  residence.
    The judge carefully explained why that was. Although the former husband
    was exercising Treaty rights and thus a qualified person at the date of
    termination of marriage in 2013, there  was  insufficient  evidence  to
    show that he had been so  qualified  throughout  any  five-year  period
    preceding termination of marriage. In particular, there  were  gaps  in
    the documentary evidence between 2009 and 2010. It follows that  during
    those gaps the first appellant cannot have been resident in the  UK  in
    accordance with the regulations, as there is insufficient evidence that
    the former husband  was  exercising  Treaty  rights  during  those  gap
    periods, even if he  was  exercising  Treaty  rights  at  the  date  of
    divorce. For any continuous period the clock  can  only  start  at  the
    earliest date of continuity at which the first appellant  was  residing
    in the UK in accordance with the regulations, in  other  words  as  the
    family member of an EEA national  present  in  the  UK  and  exercising
    Treaty rights. On the evidence, the judge found that the earliest  date
    began after February 2010.

10. It is arguable that there is a far simpler explanation as  to  why  the
    first appellant could not  meet  regulation  15(1)(b):  that  when  the
    application was made and considered by  the  Secretary  of  State,  the
    first appellant was no longer the family member  of  an  EEA  national,
    that family relationship having terminated in divorce in 2013. However,
    regulation 15(2) states that a right of permanent residence shall  only
    be lost through  absence  from  the  UK  for  a  period  exceeding  two
    consecutive years. In other words, the right  accrues  the  moment  the
    five-year period is reached and is only  lost  by  significant  absence
    from the UK. However,  this  is  a  moot  point  as,  for  the  reasons
    explained by the judge, there was insufficient evidence  that  5  years
    had accrued at the date of termination of marriage in 2013.  As  stated
    by the Upper Tribunal in OA (EEA -retained right of residence)  Nigeria
    [2010] UKAIT 0003:

         "To count as a qualifying period of residence under reg 15(1)(b)  a
         person must show, inter alia, that the five years in  question  are
         ones in which the said residence has been 'in accordance with these
         Regulations.' That entails that during those  five  years  the  EEA
         national on whom the family member relies in order to establish his
         or her right must have been continuously in the UK as a  'qualified
         person' under reg 6... exercising Treat rights... In this case  the
         respondent vigorously disputes that the appellant could  meet  this
         requirement because there was insufficient evidence to show that he
         continued to be  a  qualified  person  for  the  duration  of  that
         period."

11. In that case, as in the present appeal, there were gaps in evidence  of
    the  EEA  husband's  employment,  or  other  acceptable   evidence   of
    qualification under regulation 6, during the period of the marriage and
    thus the EEA national spouse was not qualified within  the  meaning  of
    the regulations for the entire period of the marriage.

12. However, the first appellant claimed entitlement to a  permanent  right
    of residence not under regulation 15(1)(b) but 15(1)(f), which  is  the
    correct  provision  where  there  is  a  retained  right  of  residence
    following termination of relationship as a  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national qualified by reason of exercising Treaty rights in the  UK  at
    the date of termination of marriage.

13. However, as previously stated, as the husband has  not  been  shown  to
    have  been  exercising  Treaty  rights  throughout  the  marriage,  the
    continuous five-year period can only begin at the earliest  when  there
    was cogent evidence that he was exercising  Treaty  rights,  which  the
    judge found at �10 was 26.8.11, the date of a  wage  slip  produced  in
    evidence.

14. Thus for the purpose of any five-year continuous period, from that date
    in 2011 the first appellant was resident in the UK in  accordance  with
    the regulations as the family member  of  an  EEA  national  exercising
    Treaty rights in the UK. That period continued up to the termination of
    the marriage in 2013, some 2 years, from which point onwards the  first
    appellant continued, as she had  a  retained  right  of  residence,  to
    accrue further  time  towards  the  continuous  period  of  five  years
    required  under  regulation  15(1)(f).  According  to   Judge   Taylor,
    eventually,  if  she  retains  the  right  of   residence   under   the
    regulations, she will reach a five-year  continuous  period,  entitling
    her to a right of permanent residence, but it is obvious  that  if  the
    period could  only  begin  in  2011,  it  cannot  reach  its  five-year
    completion until approximately August 2016. It thus  follows  that  the
    first appellant is not entitled to a permanent right of residence under
    the regulations at the present time.

15. I note that in OA, headnote (v) states that, "Reg 15(1)(f)  provides  a
    route for acquiring a permanent right of residence based on a  retained
    right of residence. But, as under reg 15(1)(b), so under  reg  15(1)(f)
    the family member has to show  that  the  EEA  national  concerned  was
    exercising Treaty rights continuously over the relevant period of  five
    years."

16. This suggests that the applicant has to show that  the  former  husband
    continues to exercise Treaty  rights  until  the  five-year  period  is
    complete (see �33 of the judgement in OA). I am not sure  that  can  be
    right, as it  would  mean  that  a  person  in  the  first  appellant's
    situation could never acquire a permanent right of residence unless she
    could also show that the former EEA husband  continued  to  qualify  as
    exercising Treaty rights, even after termination  of  marriage  and  up
    until she meets the five-year period. However, it is not necessary  for
    me to determine this issue as, if correct, it also resolved against the
    interests of the first appellant.

17. In the circumstances, Judge Taylor was correct to dismiss  the  appeal.
    In doing so he explained carefully at more that one  place  within  the
    determination why the first appellant could not qualify at the  present
    time for a permanent right of residence. I find no  material  error  in
    the determination. The appeals of the child appellants must  also  fail
    with that of the first appellant.

Conclusion & Decision

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeals remain dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
