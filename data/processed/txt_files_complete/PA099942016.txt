                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the  Appellant  against  the
    Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Woolf.  Following  a  hearing  at
    Hatton  Cross  on  21st  October  2016,  in  a  Decision  and   Reasons
    promulgated on 19th January 2017 Judge Woolf dismissed  the  appeal  on
    all grounds.

 2. The Appellant's asylum claim is on the basis that he is an Afghan  Sikh
    from Jalalabad. He lived there with  his  wife  and  his  parents.  His
    parents had been self-employed dealing in  land  but  2  ï¿½  years  ago,
    approximately, the business was closed because members of  the  Taliban
    were attempting to extort money that his father could not pay.  Towards
    the end of 2015  the  Appellant  and  his  wife  were  threatened  with
    abduction and  forced  conversion  to  Islam  and  so  they  both  fled
    Afghanistan with the aid of an agent in early 2016.

 3. In a detailed assessment of the evidence and  credibility  Judge  Woolf
    accepted that the Appellant and his wife came under threat of extortion
    from non state agents who targeted them because they were Sikh and that
    they had threatened the Appellant  and  his  wife  with  abduction  and
    forced to conversion to Islam.

 4. What Judge Woolf did not accept was the Appellant's claim to be unaware
    of his parents' whereabouts or their circumstances.

 5. In concluding that the Appellant had demonstrated  there  were  grounds
    for believing that the authorities in Jalalabad would not  be  able  or
    willing to afford them sufficient protection  the Judge  then  went  on
    to consider internal relocation. She referred to the  country  guidance
    case of TG and others (Afghan Sikhs persecuted) Afghanistan CG [2015]'s
    UKUT 00595 (IAC) and found that the Appellant had failed to satisfy her
    that he did not know where his family was. She noted that  he  had  not
    been able to present facts which would establish to the lower  standard
    what his family's resources are now. She noted that  according  to  him
    his father had sold the family home but he did not know for how much it
    was sold. She was not  satisfied  that  he  had  no  family  living  in
    Afghanistan and that there would be no assistance from  family  members
    were he to relocate to Kabul. She found  that  the  Appellant  had  not
    demonstrated that he lacked employment prospects were he to  remain  in
    Kabul and he had not satisfied her that he would be unsafe in Kabul  or
    that he could not establish himself there on  return.  Accordingly  she
    dismissed the appeal.

 6. The grounds upon which permission to appeal  was  granted  assert  that
    having made  the  positive  credibility  findings  the  Judge  had  not
    properly analysed the situation in Kabul in accordance with the country
    guidance case.

 7. In essence the country guidance case provides as follows:-

         (i)  Some members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in  Afghanistan
         continue to suffer harassment at the hands of Muslim zealots;  (ii)
         Members of the Sikh and Hindu communities  in  Afghanistan  do  not
         face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment such as to entitle
         them to a grant of international protection on the basis  of  their
         ethnic or religious identity, per se. Neither can it be  said  that
         the cumulative impact of discrimination suffered by  the  Sikh  and
         Hindu communities in general reaches the threshold of  persecution;
         (iii) A consideration of whether an individual member of  the  Sikh
         and Hindu communities is at risk real of persecution upon return to
         Afghanistan is fact-sensitive.  All the relevant circumstances must
         be  considered  but  careful  attention  should  be  paid  to   the
         following: (a) women are particularly vulnerable in the absence  of
         appropriate protection from a male member of the family; (b) likely
         financial circumstances and ability to access  basic  accommodation
         bearing in mind that Muslims are generally  unlikely  to  employ  a
         member of the Sikh and Hindu communities; such individuals may face
         difficulties (including threats, extortion,  seizure  of  land  and
         acts of violence) in retaining property and  /  or  pursuing  their
         remaining traditional pursuit, that of a shopkeeper /  trader;  the
         traditional source of support for such individuals, the Gurdwara is
         much less able to  provide  adequate  support;  (c)  the  level  of
         religious devotion and the practical accessibility  to  a  suitable
         place of religious worship in light of declining  numbers  and  the
         evidence that some have been subjected to harm and threats to  harm
         whilst accessing  the  Gurdwara;  and  (d)  access  to  appropriate
         education for children in light of discrimination against Sikh  and
         Hindu children and the shortage of  adequate  education  facilities
         for them.; (iv) Although it  appears  there  is  a  willingness  at
         governmental level to provide protection, it is not established  on
         the evidence that at a local level the police are willing, even  if
         able, to provide the necessary  level  of  protection  required  in
         Refugee Convention/Qualification Directive terms, to those  members
         of the Sikh and Hindu communities who experience  serious  harm  or
         harassment amounting to persecution; (v)   Whether it is reasonable
         to expect a member of the Sikh or Hindu communities to relocate  is
         a fact sensitive assessment. The relevant factors to be  considered
         include those set out  at  (iii)  above.   Given  their  particular
         circumstances and declining number, the practicability of  settling
         elsewhere for members of the Sikh and  Hindu  communities  must  be
         carefully considered.   Those  without  access  to  an  independent
         income are unlikely to be able to reasonably  relocate  because  of
         depleted support mechanisms;

 8. While Judge Wolf  did  not  accept  the  Appellant's  claim  about  his
    family's presence in Afghanistan, there was similarly no evidence  that
    they were in Kabul. They had closed their business  and  there  was  no
    evidence as to how they were supporting themselves unless it was living
    from the proceeds of sale of their home. However, of course they  would
    have to provide themselves with alternative accommodation.

 9. In particular there was no evidence to support the  Judge's  view  that
    the Appellant and his wife could establish themselves  in  Kabul.  They
    have no independent income; there are no  adequate  support  mechanisms
    and  the  Appellant  is  going  to  have  extreme  difficulty   finding
    employment as the evidence is that Muslims will  not  employ  Sikhs  or
    Hindus.

10. I find therefore that in finding  the  Appellant  and  his  wife  could
    safely relocate and establish themselves in Kabul she made an error  of
    law. That finding is not supported by the evidence and is out  of  step
    with the country guidance case.

11. The credibility findings are untainted by any error of law and they are
    preserved.

12. Accordingly, I redecide the appeal purely on the question  of  internal
    relocation and for the reasons I  have  indicated  above  I  allow  the
    appeal. There is simply no basis on which to find  this  Appellant  and
    his wife could establish themselves in Kabul. It has  been  established
    that by reason of their religion the Appellant and his wife would be at
    risk of persecution in their home area where they have been  persecuted
    in the past and that there  is  nowhere  to  which  they  could  safely
    relocate.
