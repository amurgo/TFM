Representation:
For the claimants:     Ms Z Jacob, instructed by Graceland Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the continuation/resumed hearing of  the  appeal  following  my
    decision to set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The claimants, TA, date of birth 16.8.76, and her daughter RA, date  of
    birth 27.7.07, are citizens of Nigeria.

 3. The Secretary of State appealed against the determination of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Walters, who,  on  human  rights  grounds,  allowed  the
    claimants' appeals against the decision of  the  respondent  to  refuse
    their applications for leave to remain  in  the  UK  on  the  basis  of
    article 8 family and/or private life.

 4. Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge  McCarthy  granted  permission  to
    appeal on 1.8.14. Thus the matter came before  me  on  10.9.14,  as  an
    appeal in the Upper Tribunal.

 5. I found that the First-tier Tribunal erred in conducting the article  8
    ECHR proportionality balancing exercise, taking into account irrelevant
    matters and failing to take into account factors favouring  refusal  of
    the application, including first claimant's  immigration  status,  that
    private life was established at a time when the claimants had no  right
    to remain and thus their status was precarious, and failed to  properly
    consider the relevant case law on  the  best  interests  of  the  child
    claimant.

 6. I thus set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  adjourned
    the remaking of the appeal to be heard by myself at Field House.   Thus
    the matter was relisted before me on 30.10.14.

 7. I also gave directions that I would consider  as  a  preliminary  issue
    whether the decision of the Secretary of State, dated  3.1.14,  was  in
    accordance with the law and whether therefore the  correct  outcome  of
    the appeal would be to allow it to the limited extent that the decision
    was not in accordance with  the  law  and  that  it  remained  for  the
    Secretary of State to make a decision in accordance with the law.

 8. I heard the submissions of the parties on  the  preliminary  issue  and
    reached the conclusion that it is not necessary to return the appeal to
    the Secretary of State, even if the wrong Rules  had  been  considered,
    because it is open to the Tribunal to consider  what  are  the  correct
    Rules and apply them to the claimants' circumstances.

 9. I find that the relevant  application  was  made  on  26.6.12  and  the
    decision of the Secretary of State in respect of that  application  was
    made on 3.1.14. The transitional provisions accompanying the new  Rules
    in force from 9.7.12 preserved the effect of the  previous  version  of
    the Rules for applications made under the Rules prior to 9.7.12 but not
    decided by that date. However, this was a human rights article  8  ECHR
    application, made entirely outside the Rules. There were no  pre-9.7.12
    Rules for dealing with article 8 and thus there could be no  old  Rules
    to preserve. The  transitional  provisions  have  no  relevance  to  an
    application made entirely outside the Immigration Rules, as  there  was
    no equivalent provision under the old Rules for  consideration  of  the
    application. The only framework for considering private and family life
    in existence at the date of decision was that of the  new  Rules  under
    paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM. The Secretary of State is required to
    undertake a proportionality assessment and the new Rules  comprise  the
    framework for that assessment. This is entirely  consistent  with  both
    Haleemudeen, and Edgehill, summarised in my error of law decision.

10. In the circumstances, I find that decision of the  Secretary  of  State
    was in accordance with the law  and  that  she  was  correct  to  apply
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE, before going on to  consider  whether
    there were exceptional circumstances in which refusal would  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences such that it would be disproportionate
    to the claimant's rights under article 8 ECHR.

11. Before making my findings of fact, I have taken into  account  all  the
    documentary evidence before  me,  including  the  documents  and  other
    evidence contained in the claimants' bundles for  both  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and  the  Upper  Tribunal  rehearing  of  the  appeal.  It  is
    unnecessary to recite or summarise that evidence  as  the  parties  are
    aware of the information placed before the Tribunal.

12. I also heard and took into account the following oral evidence:

      a) The first  claimant,  Temitope  Adeloa  Adesanya,  relying  on  her
         witness statements of 30.5.14 and 30.10.14;

      b) Wahab Adebanji  Olayiwola,  the  father  of  the  second  claimant,
         relying on his witness statement of 30.10.14;

      c) Olufumilayo Adebowale Adesanya, relying on his witness statement of
         30.10.14;

      d)  Adeleke Adejuwon, relying on his letter of support at A47.

13. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. The first
    claimant claims to have come to the UK as a  family  visitor  in  1995,
    though there is no record of this. She has been an overstayer at  least
    since 2006. Her daughter, the second claimant was born  in  the  UK  in
    2007 and has thus now been in the UK  some  7  years.  Over  two  years
    later, in November 2009 the first  claimant  made  an  application  for
    leave to remain outside the Rules. This was refused and  despite  being
    twice reconsidered, the refusal was maintained. Another application  on
    the basis of long residency was refused in 2011.  Despite  the  several
    applications and refusals the claimants have remained in  the  UK  when
    they should have left. On 25.6.12 the human rights claim the subject of
    this appeal was made and refused on 20.6.13.  The  Secretary  of  State
    agreed to reconsider the application, resulting in the further  refusal
    of 3.1.14.

14. The first claimant has had no legal basis to remain  in  the  UK  since
    1996, or 2006, depending on when she first  arrived  here.  She  claims
    that her elderly mother (born in 1934) lives alone in  a  village  near
    Lagos, Nigeria and she has recently had a stroke. However there  is  no
    medical evidence of any ill-health of her mother.  She  claims  not  to
    have been in touch with her mother since she visited the UK in  2006/7.
    However, her first witness statement claimed that her mother visits the
    UK regularly to see her and her sisters and  cousins.  She  now  claims
    that statement was incorrect and that her mother only came  to  the  UK
    once. She claims that she has no one to go back to in Nigeria  and  she
    and her daughter would have to live on the street.

15. The first claimant relies on close family ties in the UK. Her surviving
    siblings, two sisters, live in the UK as British  citizens.  The  first
    claimant has worked illegally in the UK over several years,  until  she
    was asked to prove her immigration status. Between 2006  and  2013  she
    lived  with  her  sister  Oluwakemi  Adedoyin  Lambo.  From  2013   and
    continuing she and her daughter  live  with  Oluwabumni  Afusait  Bakre
    Adejuwon and her family.

16. According to her first witness statement, she met  the  father  of  her
    daughter Mr Olayiwola in 2006.  He  ended  the  relationship  when  she
    became pregnant and she refused his request to terminate the pregnancy.
    The second claimant was born 27.7.07 and has thus now lived in  the  UK
    for over 7 years. There was no reference in this witness  statement  to
    any ongoing relationship or contact between either  of  the  claimant's
    and the second claimant's father.

17. In her second witness statement, however,  after  repeating  that  they
    split up when she became pregnant, she claims that there is now a  good
    relationship between the second claimant and her father. She said  that
    the first time he saw his daughter was when she was 4  months  old  and
    that from that time he has been involved with her life, seeing her most
    weekends and speaking to her on a mobile phone he bought her.

18. In  evidence  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  first  claimant  was
    challenged about the discrepancy between her  statement  and  her  oral
    evidence. He is not named on the birth certificate and she did not tell
    him about their Tribunal hearing and the prospect of being  removed  to
    Nigeria, or ask him to make a witness statement detailing  his  contact
    with the second claimant. The judge did not believe that there was  any
    contact between them, and that is a matter I must take into account  in
    considering the further evidence.

19. It is concerning that no reference to any ongoing relationship  between
    the second claimant and her father was mentioned in the  first  witness
    statement,  which  states  at  �7  "this   ended   our   relationship."
    Surprisingly, the second witness statement does not explain when he got
    back in contact. On any version, of events it is clear that  the  first
    claimant  has  been  prepared  to  be  dishonest  in   her   statements
    immigration  authorities.  This  undermines  her  credibility  and  the
    reliance I can place on her assurances as  to  the  extent  of  contact
    between the second claimant and her father at the present time.

20. When challenged about the relationship between the second claimant  and
    her father in evidence before me, the first claimant  gave  an  account
    that they split up when she was pregnant and they lost contact for some
    months. Through a friend they got back in contact in 2006.  That  would
    have been before the birth of the second claimant. She was asked if  it
    was her case that they got back in contact in 2006 and that he has  had
    a role in the second claimant's life since then.  She  then  said  that
    they talked a "little bit" in 2006 but then stopped and were  not  back
    in contact until 2010. That does not explain how she could say that the
    first time he saw the second claimant was when she was  4  months  old,
    which would have been around late 2007. No satisfactory explanation has
    been provided as to how or why they allegedly got back  in  touch  from
    2010.

21. More significantly, I note that in her March 2010 statutory declaration
    for her long residence application,  the  first  claimant  stated  that
    there was no contact whatsoever with the second claimant's father, "Her
    father is now separated from us. I am having a sole responsibility  for
    her upkeep. We do not have any contact with him  since  he  separated."
    The declaration  concludes,  "I  make  this  declaration  solemnly  and
    conscientiously believing the same to be true  and  by  virtue  of  the
    statutory Declarations Act 1835." On any version of her evidence,  that
    account could not be true.

22. Asked why she had not mentioned the resumed relationship in  her  first
    witness statement, signed in May 2014, she said only that the solicitor
    didn't ask her about it. Challenged as to that answer she said  perhaps
    it was because  she  was  distressed.  I  found  the  first  claimant's
    evidence  very   unsatisfactory,   vague   and   unreliable.   In   the
    circumstances, taking the  evidence  as  a  whole,  I  find  that  when
    answering questions on this issue the first  claimant  was  fabricating
    her evidence to try and address this by suggesting that they  got  back
    in touch in 2010 after the statutory declaration. I find  her  evidence
    on this issue  not  credible  and  am  satisfied  that  she  was  being
    dishonest in her oral evidence before me.

23. It was pointed out to the first claimant that none of  the  photographs
    she adduced show the second claimant with her father during  the  years
    when it is said they have had  a  good  relationship.  Neither  was  he
    mentioned in any document relating to the claimants during this period.
    She had no satisfactory explanation. As part of his oral  evidence,  Mr
    Olayiwola showed me a few photographs on  his  mobile  phone  from  two
    separate dates in September 2014, in which  he  and  the  daughter  are
    together at either McDonalds or KFC. He had a couple of  other  earlier
    photographs of the second claimant but in which he does not appear.  To
    my view the photographs of the father with the second  claimant  appear
    contrived and I have reached the conclusion, taking the evidence in the
    round, that they were taken for the express purpose of  bolstering  the
    claimants' case at this appeal hearing. In any event, taken as a  whole
    the evidence demonstrates a relationship only as far  back  as  a  date
    after I found an error  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and set it aside on 10.9.14.

24. I take into account the handwritten statements of the second  claimant,
    but I agree with Judge Walters that it is obvious that she  has  copied
    the first of these from a document produced by a lawyer or other adult.
    However, neither letter makes  any  reference  to  her  father  or  any
    relationship with him. She cites a number of reasons why she  does  not
    want to go to Nigeria. Her primary reason for wanting to remain  it  to
    continue her education and  to  see  her  friends,  uncles  aunts,  and
    cousins.

25. Asked how often the second claimant saw her father, the first  claimant
    said in evidence that sometimes when he is free  he  picks  her  up  on
    Friday, or he sometimes spoke to her on the phone; it  was  all  rather
    vague. Later she said that she took her daughter to meet him on Fridays
    after school and he spend 1 hour with her at  McDonalds  and  then  she
    picked her up. Sometimes he saw her on Saturdays. Her witness statement
    suggests he saw her most weekends.

26. I did not find Mr Olayiwola a reliable witness.  He  is  married  to  a
    Dutch citizen, as a result of which he has an EEA residence  card,  but
    she was not present; he said she was making a visit to the  Netherlands
    to see her mother. The only evidence of that  relationship  other  than
    his word was the marriage certificate, his  passport  vignette,  and  a
    rather fuzzy picture of her passport. In any event, he does not have  a
    permanent right of residence in the UK and it is far from clear  to  me
    on the limited evidence available that he is in a genuine  relationship
    with an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the UK. He admitted in
    oral evidence that in his appeal he failed to mention  that  he  had  a
    child in the UK. In the absence of credible and  satisfactory  positive
    evidence as to the issue of his current relationship, I find  that  his
    status in the UK is potentially precarious.

27. His rather short witness statement is to the effect that although he is
    married to someone else, the second claimant is his only  daughter  and
    he has a close relationship with her. In addition  to  meeting  at  the
    weekend in McDonalds or KFC, he talks to her on the phone on most  days
    and helps her with schoolwork and provides financial support for school
    clubs. He stated that he would be devastated  and  traumatised  if  she
    were required to return to Nigeria, where she has never  lived  and  is
    terrified of the security situation there. Strangely, no explanation is
    given as to his relationship with the first claimant  or  when  and  in
    what circumstances he has had contact with the second claimant. I  take
    into account that he turned up to  give  evidence  in  support  of  the
    claimants and the argument that he would not have done so if there were
    not such a relationship. However, taken as a whole, I found  the  whole
    situation and evidence in support rather odd and unsatisfactory. I  was
    far from satisfied that there  was  any  genuine  relationship  at  any
    stage.

28. In his oral evidence to me he was asked whether he had always  been  in
    touch with the second claimant. He said not regularly,  but  he  always
    talked to her. He said that they were together with the second claimant
    a couple of months before he separated from the  first  claimant.  That
    was entirely at odds with the evidence  of  the  first  claimant.  More
    significantly, according to him, they resumed  contact  in  2008.  When
    told that the first claimant had said that it was in 2010, I found that
    he adapted his evidence in quite a non-credible  way  to  suggest  that
    since he founded his relationship with his wife he  had  not  seen  the
    first claimant but made sure that he saw his daughter. He claimed  that
    he had seen her almost every weekend. Asked to clarify whether  he  saw
    the first  claimant  in  relation  to  these  visits  with  the  second
    claimant, he did not answer the question directly but  said  that  they
    did not talk. Even that appeared not to be true, because he went on  to
    explain that he would call his daughter to see if he could see  her  at
    the weekend and ask her to pass the phone to the first claimant so they
    could make the arrangements. Later, he said that he had attended at the
    first claimant's home to make such arrangements and  had  done  so  the
    previous weekend.

29. Mr Olayiwola seemed to have difficulty answering  a  straight  question
    with  a  straight  answer.  He  frequently  altered  his  account  when
    challenged. He said that he  had  been  seeing  his  daughter  on  this
    weekend  meeting  at  McDonalds  basis  since  2011.  Asked  what   the
    arrangements were before 2011 he did not directly answer the  question,
    but eventually said that prior to 2011  his  contact  with  the  second
    claimant was perhaps twice a month. Asked when he started  to  see  her
    twice a month he said before 2010. Later he said that  before  2010  he
    also saw her twice a month. Asked how often he  had  seen  her  between
    2007 to 2010, he simply replied, from birth. He then  went  on  to  say
    that from 2007-2010 he saw his daughter twice a  month  and  from  2011
    every weekend. Frankly, I found his prevarication and alteration of his
     account undermining of not only his  credibility  but  the  claimants'
    claim that the second claimant had a good relationship with her natural
    father in the UK.

30. I have taken account of the  oral  evidence  of  the  other  witnesses,
    pleading for the claimants to be allowed to remain in the UK.  I  note,
    however, that neither witness mentions the second claimant's father  in
    their statements or letters. The claimant's sister  was  asked  if  she
    knew Mr Olayiwola but could only say that she thought he was the father
    of the  first  claimant's  baby.  Nothing  in  the  evidence  of  these
    witnesses supports any ongoing relationship between the first or second
    claimant and Mr Olayiwola.

31. In all the circumstances and for the reasons stated herein,  I  am  not
    satisfied on the evidence taken as a whole that there is  in  fact  any
    genuine or subsisting father-child relationship between the father  and
    the second claimant.  I find that it has been entirely contrived,  with
    the father's apparent cooperation, for the purpose  of  bolstering  the
    claimants' application for leave to remain. I thus reach the conclusion
    that there is no family life between either claimant and  Mr  Olayiwola
    that could engage article 8.

32. Claims in respect of private and family  life  have  to  be  considered
    first under the Immigration Rules. However, it is clear that the  first
    claimant does not meet  the  requirements  of  either  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules. Although the second claimant
    has now been in the UK for just over 7 years and is under  the  age  of
    18, to qualify under 276ADE the claimant would have  to  show  that  it
    would not be reasonable to  expect  her  to  accompany  her  mother  to
    Nigeria. In the circumstances of this  case,  including  my  article  8
    assessment, I  find  that  the  second  claimant  does  not  meet  that
    criteria. Her mother does not qualify for leave to remain and as I have
    found that there is no family life with her father sufficient to engage
    article 8, even considering such family life as there may be  with  the
    relatives with whom she lives, I find that it is reasonable  to  expect
    her to accompany her mother to Nigeria, even though she has never lived
    there and has spent all her life in the UK.

33. I do not accept the argument advanced by Ms Jacob at �62 to 68  of  her
    skeleton argument and elaborated upon in her oral submission to me that
    the first claimant meets the requirements of Appendix FM for  leave  to
    remain. That argument depends on the entitlement of the second claimant
    to remain, which I also reject for the reasons set out herein.  I  find
    that it is would in fact be reasonable to expect the second claimant to
    leave the UK with her mother and thus the first  claimant  cannot  meet
    the requirements of Appendix FM for leave to remain as a parent,  quite
    apart from any difficulty arising from the requirement that the 7 years
    must precede the date of application.

34. It is arguable that in relation to at least the second claimant if  not
    the  first,  the  application   paragraph   276ADE   is   a   form   of
    proportionality assessment. However, recent case law has suggested that
    neither Appendix FM nor paragraph 276ADE is  a  complete  code  in  the
    Gulshan  or  the MF(Nigeria) sense.

35. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be  the  same;  what  matters  is  that
    proportionality balancing exercise is required to be  carried  out.  In
    other words, a proportionality test is required whether under  the  new
    rules or article 8.


36. More recently, Gulshan (Article 8  -  new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
    [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) has set out, inter alia, that  on  the  current
    state of the authorities:


            (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on  the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin). In the absence of such insurmountable obstacles, it
           is necessary to show other non-standard and particular  features
           demonstrating that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


37. Applying the above guidance  and  case  authority,  I  have  considered
    whether there might arguably be good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to
    remain outside the Immigration Rules, on the basis  of  the  claimants'
    circumstances,  or  other  compelling   circumstances,   insufficiently
    recognised in the Rules so as  to  render  the  decision  unjustifiably
    harsh. I do not  find  any  exceptional,  compelling  or  compassionate
    circumstances in this case. Obviously, both  claimants  would  wish  to
    remain in the UK and they have naturally developed emotional ties  with
    other relatives and the more distant relatives  with  whom  they  live.
    That is not to be undervalued  and  I  have  carefully  considered  the
    letters of support and the oral evidence in  relation  to  this  issue.
    However, that does not, in my view amount to compelling  circumstances.
    Neither can I conclude that on the facts of this case  the  claimants's
    circumstances are such that removal could be regarded  as  unreasonably
    harsh.


38. Nevertheless it seems to me that pursuant to section 86  of  the  2002,
    the Tribunal is required to undertake an article 8  assessment  outside
    the Rules, applying the five Razgar steps, of which the crucial  issue,
    as it is in most  cases,  is  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise
    between on the one hand the legitimate and necessary aim of  the  state
    to protect the economic well-being of the UK through the application of
    immigration control and on the other the article 8 private  and  family
    life rights of the claimants.

39. In considering the public interest  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise I am obliged to have regard to section 117B of the 2002 Act:

           117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases


           (1)    The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
           the public interest.


           (2)    It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-


                 (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and


                 (b) are better able to integrate into society.


           (3)    It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-


                 (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and


                 (b) are better able to integrate into society.


           (4)    Little weight should be given to-


                 (a) a private life, or


                 (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying  partner,  that
                 is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
                 the United Kingdom unlawfully.


           (5)     Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
           established by a person at a time when the person's  immigration
           status is precarious.


           (6)    In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-


           (a)  the  person  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
           relationship with a qualifying child, and


           (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the
           United Kingdom.


40. It follows from this that little weight should be given to any  private
    life established by either claimant given that their immigration status
    was to say the least precarious and that the first claimant  overstayed
    in the UK and has been unlawfully present since at least 2006,  if  not
    longer. It is also relevant that the first claimant is not  financially
    independent and has had to depend  on  the  generosity  of  others  for
    support, once she was prevented from undertaking further illegal  work.
    That she might in the future be able to obtain  employment  to  support
    herself and the second claimant is a possibility which I have, however,
    taken into account.

41. It is well established that in performing the Article 8  balance  under
    the ECHR regard must be had to the  welfare  of  any  children  of  the
    family. In considering proportionality I have borne in mind section  55
    and the need to take as a primary consideration the best  interests  of
    the second claimant child, who, through no fault of her own,  was  born
    in the UK and has never lived in Nigeria. She has known  only  life  in
    the UK and in enrolled at school and commenced her education, with  all
    the expected consequences flowing from that for  her  integration  into
    life in the UK. However, I  have  to  bear  in  mind  that  the  second
    claimant is not a British citizen and formed her private life in the UK
    when she had no lawful status.

42. In  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (decisions  affecting  children;  onward
    appeals) [2013] UKUT 197(IAC) the Upper  Tribunal  in  considering  the
    case law in relation to decisions  affecting  children  identified  the
    following principles to assist in the determination  of  appeals  where
    children are affected by the appealed decisions:


          "i) As a starting point it is in the best interests of children to
         be with both their parents and if both parents  are  being  removed
         from the United Kingdom then the starting point  suggests  that  so
         should dependent children who form part of their  household  unless
         there are reasons to the contrary .
         ii)  It is generally in the interests  of  children  to  have  both
         stability and continuity of social and  educational  provision  and
         the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the  society  to
         which they belong.
         iii)  Lengthy residence in a country other than the state of origin
         can lead to development of social  cultural  and  educational  ties
         that it would be  inappropriate  to  disrupt,  in  the  absence  of
         compelling  reason  to  the  contrary.  What  amounts  to   lengthy
         residence is not clear cut  but  past  and  present  policies  have
         identified seven years as a relevant period.
         iv)  Apart from the terms of  published  policies  and  rules,  the
         Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is likely to be  more
         significant to a child than the first seven  years  of  life.  Very
         young children are focussed on  their  parents  rather  than  their
         peers and are adaptable.
         v)  Short periods of residence, particularly ones without leave  or
         the reasonable expectation of  leave  to  enter  or  remain,  while
         claims are promptly  considered,  are  unlikely  to  give  rise  to
         private life deserving of respect in  the  absence  of  exceptional
         factors. In any event, protection of  the  economic  well-being  of
         society amply justifies removal in such cases."

      a) In EV (Philippines) the Court of Appeal held that in answering  the
         question whether it is in the best interests of a child  to  remain
         the longer the child has been in the UK the greater the weight that
         falls into one side of the scales. "In the  balance  on  the  other
         side there falls to be taken into account the strong weight  to  be
         given to the need to maintain immigration control in pursuit of the
         economic well-being of the country and the fact that, ex hyopthesi,
         the  applicants  have  no  entitlement  to  remain."  "If   it   is
         overwhelmingly the  child's  best  interests  that  he  should  not
         return, the need to maintain immigration control may well  not  tip
         the balance. By contrast, if it is in the child's best interests to
         remain, but only on balance (with some factors pointing  the  other
         way), the result may be the opposite." "The immigration history  of
         the patents may also be relevant e.g. if they are  overstayers,  or
         have acted deceitfully."

43. I find that it there is insufficient her to demonstrate an overwhelming
    best interest to remain. It is in fact a balancing  exercise.  Pursuant
    to EV (Philippines) and the skeleton argument I  confirm  that  I  have
    considered the following factors:

      a) The age of the second claimant, now 7;

      b) Length of time in the UK, now 7 years;

      c) Length of time in education, since the age of four;

      d) To what extent they have become distanced  from  Nigeria.  In  that
         regard I do not accept that the first claimant has no contact  with
         her mother. Their relationship was close enough for mother to visit
         her family in the UK and for the family to be aware of her state of
         health;

      e) How renewable their connection will be. The second claimant has  no
         connection with Nigeria, but her mother does;

      f) To  what  extent  they  will  have  linguistic,  medical  or  other
         difficulties in adapting to their life in that country. As set  out
         herein, I accept that there will be difficulties of integration and
         adjustment, but as the child is young she will  be  able  to  adapt
         with the support of her mother;

      g) The extent to which the course proposed will interfere  with  their
         family life or rights  if  they  have  any)  as  British  citizens.
         Neither are British citizens, but I accept  that  the  decision  to
         remove is a sufficiently grave interference so as to engage article
         8.

44. In considering the best interests of the child, I have also taken  into
    account all those factors urged upon me by Ms Jacob, as well  as  those
    considered by Judge Walters at  �30  of  his  decision,  including  the
    second claimant's education and career ambitions and  her  social  life
    and activities. I am not  satisfied  that  there  is  any  genuine  and
    subsisting father-daughter relationship between the second claimant and
    Mr Olayiwol and thus it cannot be said that it is in her best interests
    to remain in the UK, whether or not his own entitlement  to  remain  as
    the spouse of an  EEA  national  exercising  Treaty  rights  proves  to
    entitle him to a right of permanent residence.

45. Whilst the second claimant has lived in the UK for  7  years,  most  of
    that time, all but perhaps the last 2-3 years, will have  been  focused
    on her mother and the close  household  members.  She  is  still  young
    enough to adapt. The second claimant's strongest bond will be with  her
    mother and she is not going to be separated  from  her  mother.  Either
    they stay together in the UK or they are removed together to Nigeria.

46. To the extent that the claimants live with another family of relatives,
    I take into account the authority of Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39.
    This case considers whether the Appellate Authority  should  take  into
    account the impact  of  the  claimant's  proposed  removal  upon  those
    sharing life with him or only its impact upon him personally. The right
    to respect for the family life of one necessarily encompasses the right
    to respect for the family life of others with whom that family life  is
    enjoyed.

47. I do not accept that there has been any unmeritorious delay on the part
    of the Secretary of State by a failure to  remove  the  claimants.  The
    first claimant had no lawful right or any legitimate  expectation  that
    either she or the second claimant would be able to remain  in  the  UK.
    Although she made a number of applications, all of which were  refused,
    she failed to leave. It is reasonable to expect a law-abiding person to
    leave the UK once an application for leave to remain has failed, rather
    than wait for enforcement to take place.

48. I do find that there has been an unsatisfactorily  explained  delay  on
    the part of the first claimant. If she did come to the UK  in  1995  as
    claimed, she left it to 2009 to make any application at all. She claims
    that this was because she could not prove she had arrived in 1995. I do
    not find that credible. Even if she only arrived  in  2006,  she  still
    waited 3 years to make any application. Instead, she kept herself under
    the radar, working illegally and bearing a child, taking  advantage  of
    state benefits to which she had no  entitlement,  including  educations
    for herself and her daughter. To a significant degree,  the  delay  and
    the consequent development of any private or family life was enabled by
    the first claimant's failure to abide  by  immigration  rules  and  her
    illegal behaviour in remaining.

49. Whilst I have taken  into  account  all  the  evidence,  the  following
    further factors in  the  claimants'  favour  have  been  into  account.
    However, by no means is this intended to be an exhaustive list:

      a) That the first claimant has two sisters and other near relatives in
         the UK, with whom she now has a good and close relationship;

      b) That the claimants live in the home of a more distant relative  and
         that the claimants, particularly the second claimant, have formed a
         close bond with the children of the family;

      c) That the first claimant  has  made  a  number  of  applications  to
         attempt to regularise her position in the UK;

      d) That the first claimant has worked in  the  UK,  albeit  illegally,
         demonstrating that she has the potential to provide for herself and
         her daughter;

      e) The degree of integration  of  both  claimants  into  their  social
         environment, as set out in the papers and  evidence  called  before
         me, without needing to recite it here;

      f) That the second claimant has known nothing other than life  in  the
         UK up to the present time and that all of her education to date has
         been here and that she has been in schooling since age four and  is
         progressing well. That her education is likely to be disrupted  and
         replaced by education in Nigeria that is inferior to that of the UK
         and that her life and career prospects may be very much  diminished
         when compared with what she might expect if permitted to remain  in
         the UK;

      g) Similarly, the first claimant's prospects in Nigeria  may  be  very
         much inferior to that she could expect if permitted  to  remain  in
         the UK.

50. As factors favouring removal, the matters I  have  taken  into  account
    include the following when  conducting  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.

      a) Any private life was established at  a  time  when  the  claimants'
         immigration status was both unlawful and precarious and they had no
         right to be or remain in the UK;

      b)  That  the  claimants  could  continue  such   private   life   and
         associations with their wider family members through  modern  means
         of communication and occasional visits;

      c) That the claimants still  have  family  in  Nigeria,  even  if  the
         mother/grandmother is elderly and perhaps unsurprisingly not in the
         best of health;

      d) That the first claimant has lived most of her life in  Nigeria  and
         will  have  retained  her  cultural  identity  to  Nigeria,  making
         integration the easier;

      e) That the claimants  have  not  demonstrated  that  there  are  very
         serious obstacles to their integration in Nigeria. Even though  the
         second claimant has never lived there and  is  fearful  because  of
         what she has been told, or heard or read, she is young, can quickly
         adapt, and has her mother to be with her;

      f) That there are no medical or similar issues preventing their return
         to Nigeria;

      g) That the first claimant's relationship with her adult siblings  and
         other relatives discloses, in my view, no more emotional bond  than
         one might expect between adult relatives.  It  is  now  commonplace
         that adult children and siblings live their lives far apart. Whilst
         they may stay in touch and feel close to each other, that does  not
         mean that they have family life which engages the sort of right  to
         be protected under article 8;

      h) They may desire to remain and take advantage of  life  in  the  UK,
         including education and  career  opportunities,  but  that  neither
         creates a legitimate  expectation  of  being  able  to  remain  nor
         provides any reason why they should be permitted to remain  outside
         the Immigration Rules. Article 8 is not a  shortcut  to  compliance
         with the Immigration Rules;

      i)  That  the  first  claimant  has  engaged  in  unlawful  behaviour,
         including overstaying, working illegally, and failing to leave when
         her applications to remain were refused;

      j) That the first claimant is currently unemployed with no job  offer.
         If she is permitted to remain with the second claimant it  is  very
         likely that they will seek and/or be entitled to state benefits, as
         they are not financially independent;

      k) Pursuant to EV (Philippines), as potentially outweighing  interests
         of the child to remain and take advantage of education and life  in
         the UK, that whilst she has been in the  UK  7  years  from  birth,
         those 7 years are not as significant as 7 years from, say, the  age
         of 4, and thus the weight to be attached to  those  years  for  the
         second claimant in the balancing exercise is limited;

      l) The strong weight to be given to immigration control,  particularly
         when the claimant entered the UK as a visitor with leave limited to
         6 months and by implication  making  a  false  assurance  that  she
         intended to leave on or before the expiry of such leave,  and  that
         she has remained in the UK for a significant period of time without
         contacting the immigration authorities;

      m) That although there is an immigration  rules  route  for  leave  to
         remain, the claimants do not meet any of those requirements;

      n) That I have found that there is no  genuine  or  subsisting  family
         life relationship between the second claimant and Mr  Olayiwol  and
         thus that it cannot be in the best interests of the second claimant
         to remain in the UK;

      o) That there is nothing remarkable, exceptional or  compelling  about
         the circumstances of the claimants. In essence, their  private  and
         family is only what one would expect to have developed  over  their
         years of unlawful presence;

51.  Weighing  all  these  factors  together,  in   the   round,   in   the
    proportionality balancing exercise I find that  the  decisions  of  the
    Secretary of State to remove the claimants is entirely proportionate to
    the public interest. Whilst there may be some hardship or difficulty in
    adjusting to life in Nigeria for both  claimants  in  perhaps  slightly
    different ways and for different reasons, and although they will be sad
    and disappointed to leave their friends and wider family members in the
    UK, there are no circumstances here which one could properly  described
    as exception, or sufficiently compelling and/or compassionate so as  to
    justify granting leave to remain on the  basis  of  article  8  private
    and/or family life under article 8 ECHR outside the  Immigration  Rules
    on the basis that the decision would otherwise be unjustifiably  harsh.
    The claimants have no right to remain  in  the  UK  or  any  legitimate
    expectation of being able to do so. The situation has  only  been  made
    more difficult for them by reason of the first  claimant's  failure  to
    return home to Nigeria when  she  should  have  done,  but  instead  to
    persist in remaining her unlawfully. Article 8 is  not  a  shortcut  to
    compliance with the Immigration  Rules,  which  provides  a  route  for
    immigration to the UK. Whilst the standard of life including  education
    and career prospects are less favourable than in the UK, that does  not
    justify granting leave to remain. As stated in case authority,  the  UK
    cannot be expected to educate the world. Neither can it be expected  to
    host those who simply prefer to be here to join or  remain  with  other
    family members.

52. Having made these findings and reached these conclusions  I  return  to
    paragraph 276ADE  in  relation  to  the  second  claimant  and  further
    conclude that it would in the circumstances of this case be  reasonable
    to expect the daughter to accompany her mother to Nigeria and  thus  to
    leave the UK. As stated, I am not satisfied that there is  any  genuine
    relationship with the person alleged to be her natural father and  thus
    no interference on that account with family life between  her  and  her
    father. Such limited links there may be between them did not appear  to
    be significant enough for the second claimant to mention  them  in  her
    two letters to the Tribunal.

53. Mr Jacobs also sought to raise entitlement of the second claimant under
    the EEA Regulations, as a dependant of the spouse of an  EEA  national.
    This was never a ground of application to the Secretary of State nor  a
    ground appeal to the Tribunal.  It  is  a  matter  that  has  not  been
    considered by the Secretary of State, but it  is  open  to  the  second
    claimant to make any such application as she may consider entitles  her
    to remain in the UK. In any event, in the light of my findings set  out
    above, I am not satisfied that the second claimant is  a  dependant  of
    the spouse of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the  UK.  For
    the reasons set out above, even if she is a dependant, which I  do  not
    accept, there was insufficient evidence in relation to this issue.

Conclusion & Decision

54. Having considered all the evidence in the round, as  a  whole,  I  find
    that neither claimant meets the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.
    In consideration of  their  circumstances  outside  the  Rules  and  in
    weighing that evidence and my findings of fact in  the  proportionality
    balance, the claimants have failed to demonstrate to the  low  standard
    of proof required that the decision of the Secretary of State to remove
    them is either disproportionate, unreasonable, or unjustifiably harsh.

                  I dismiss the appeal of each claimant on both  immigration
                  and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
