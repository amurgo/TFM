Representation:
Appellant:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Respondents:  Ms J Todd of Latta and Co Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondents to this appeal are mother (aged 34 years) and son (aged
    4 years) respectively, both nationals of Pakistan.  A lady who  is  the
    mother's sister, and the son's aunt, lives in the United Kingdom.  This
    appeal has its origins in decisions made by the Entry Clearance Officer
    of Istanbul (the "ECO"), dated 25 July 2013, whereby  the  Respondents'
    application  for clearance to enter the United Kingdom for  the  avowed
    purpose of visiting the aforementioned lady for a period of three weeks
    was  refused.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  (the  "FtT"),   allowed   the
    Respondents' appeal.

 2. Duly analysed, the decision of  the  ECO  contains  four  findings,  or
    evaluative assessments:

      a) While  the  application  made  certain  representations  about  the
         employment  and  income  of  the  Respondents'  spouse/father,   no
         supporting evidence was provided.

      b) Whereas the bank statements purported to demonstrate total funds of
         some ï¿½12,000 in the accounts  of  husband  and  wife  respectively,
         these were based on deposits made during the previous three  months
         and the source of these monies was not evidenced,  thereby  calling
         into question whether the money would be available for the  purpose
         of the visit and related sojourn.

      c) Thirdly, the source of the funding was Iran  and  the  funds  were,
         thus, not transferrable to the United Kingdom.

    Based on the above analysis, the ECO made two conclusions.  First, that
    the Respondents were not genuinely seeking to enter the United  Kingdom
    for the limited purpose and period stated  or  that  they  intended  to
    leave: see paragraph 41(i) and (ii) of the Immigration Rules.   Second,
    the asserted funds were not available to the Respondents and there  was
    no evidence that the sponsor, who is unemployed, would be able to offer
    the requisite financial support or  to  accommodate  them  in  her  one
    bedroom property: see Rule 41(vi) and (vii) accordingly.

 3. In the concluding paragraph of its determination, the FtT stated:

         "I  consider  that  the  five  tests  in  Razgar  are   met.    The
         interference with family life is  not  necessary  in  a  democratic
         society in the public interest ......

         The only way in reality for the Appellant to maintain  family  life
         with her sister and for her son to meet his aunt is for  [them]  to
         visit the sponsor in the UK.  The reason for refusal was based on a
         reasonable reason at the time. However, the sponsor  has  explained
         the level of income and the source of the deposit  in  the  account
         ....

         Close siblings do have  family  life  and  it  is  right  that  the
         sponsor's nephew be allowed to meet her given that he  is  able  to
         meet his other aunts in person in Iran. He only wishes  to  do  the
         same with his aunt in the United Kingdom.  I do not  consider  that
         there is any reason for the Appellants to overstay  in  the  United
         Kingdom."

    Permission to appeal to this Tribunal was granted  in  somewhat  opaque
    terms.  This, we consider, is at least in  part  a  reflection  of  the
    equally  obscure  formulation  contained   in   the   application   for
    permission.  The application, in our  view,  contains  in  the  main  a
    series  of  mere  quarrels  with  certain   findings   and   evaluative
    assessments in the determination and, fundamentally, fails to formulate
    in a coherent and intelligible manner the error or errors of  law  said
    to vitiate the  determination.   In  this  context,  we  refer  to  the
    decision of this Tribunal  in  Nixon  (Permission  to  Appeal:  Ground)
    [2014] UKUT 00368 (IAC).  It  suffices  to  observe,  with  substantial
    understatement, that this application for permission to appeal was  not
    a model of its type. Its manifold shortcomings are illustrated  in  the
    following omnibus claim:

         "It is submitted that the appeal is to be dismissed in the interest
         of justice and fairness, immigration control and economic wellbeing
         of the country, which is the purpose of the Immigration Rules."

         [Our emphasis.]

    Those tasked with the responsibility of preparing applications of  this
    kind, together  with  those  who  provide  oversight,  supervision  and
    quality control should take note that this kind of pleading is  utterly
    meaningless.

 4. We conclude without hesitation that permission  to  appeal  should  not
    have been granted in the present case.  That does not mean  ipso  facto
    that the decision of the FtT is necessarily beyond  reproach.  However,
    the framework of any appeal to this Tribunal is shaped by the terms  in
    which permission to appeal is granted.  The latter, in turn, invariably
    takes its cue  from  the  application  for  permission.  We  began  our
    assessment with  the  observation  that  the  terms  of  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal are opaque. Viewed through the broadest  and  most
    generous prism, we conclude that the grant of permission  suffers  from
    the same fundamental failing contaminating the  permission  application
    itself.  Insofar as the grant of permission was based on  a  suggestion
    that the FtT has  made  irrational  findings  and/or  conclusions,  the
    Appellant's challenge falls markedly short of overcoming this  exacting
    threshold.

DECISION

 5. The appeal is dismissed.
