                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge P J M Hollingworth, promulgated on 4th September 2014,  following
    the hearing at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 26th August  2014.   In
    the determination, the judge dismissed the  appeal  of  Mr  Chukwuebuka
    Michael Nwadiuto.  The Appellant  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Nigeria,  who  was  born  on  7th
    October 1990.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    3rd January 2014, refusing his application for a residence  card  under
    Regulation 8(1) of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  such  a
    refusal being on the basis that the  Appellant  had  not  provided  any
    evidence of his dependency on his EEA national  Sponsor  at  any  time,
    either in Nigeria or in the United Kingdom.  He also had  not  provided
    any evidence  that  he  was  dependent  on  his  EEA  national  Sponsor
    immediately prior to entering the United Kingdom.

 3. The Appellant's case is that he has been dependent  on  his  uncle,  Mr
    Ucho Onwuzo.  He has been in the United Kingdom  since  February  2011.
    He has been living with his uncle since then.  His case has  been  that
    when he was in Nigeria  he  was  sent  money  through  his  family  and
    supported at school with payment of five school fees from the age of 13
    to 18, by the uncle.  The uncle, Mr Ucho Onwuzo, then moved to  Germany
    in 2000 and supported him from Germany until he  moved  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2009 and carried on supporting him.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge  set  out  the  background  to  the  Appellant's  claim.   He
    described how the Appellant had been living with his mother and brother
    and sister from 2000 until 2009 in Nigeria.  The mother was  a  trader,
    she bought and sold goods.  The  Appellant's  brother  and  sister  are
    still in Nigeria, and are younger than the Appellant and are  going  to
    school.  The judge observed that when the Appellant's representative at
    the hearing, asked the Appellant for  the  identity  of  his  financial
    Sponsors, "the  Appellant  replied  mum  and  dad  were  the  financial
    Sponsors" (paragraph 9).  The judge further observed  that  the  uncle,
    upon whom the case of dependency was based, was not  in  attendance  at
    the hearing, such that the judge could place no weight upon the uncle's
    statement, because no reasons were  given  for  his  absence  from  the
    hearing (see paragraph 18).

 5. Furthermore, the judge observed that, "there  is  distinct  paucity  of
    corroborative documentary evidence showing that the  Appellant's  uncle
    sent any money to Nigeria for the benefit of the Appellant"  (paragraph
    19).  The judge was clear that the Appellant's representative "was able
    to draw my attention to one document to which I have referred above  in
    setting  out  his  submissions  which  constituted  the   corroborative
    documentary evidence" (paragraph 20).

 6.  The  judge's  clear  conclusions   were   that   the   Appellant   was
    "unconvincing, and lacking in plausibility" because

         "not only was he unable to recollect the details  of  his  original
         visa application to the United Kingdom [that is to say] in terms of
         who exactly was sponsoring him  but  it  took  him  a  considerable
         period of time to be able to explain the details of his pursuit  of
         studies in the United Kingdom" (paragraph 21).

 7. In any event, the judge noted how,

         "the statement of the Appellant is remarkable for its brevity.   No
         detail is contained within  that  statement  as  to  the  financial
         position.  ....  There  has  been  no  attempt  whatsoever  in  the
         witness statement of the Appellant or  his  uncle  to  exhibit  any
         items in the bundle submitted on behalf of the Appellant".

 8. There was, however, the issue of the "commonality of address", but  the
    judge  observed  that,  "even  on  the  basis  that  the  corroborative
    documentary   evidence   establishes   commonality   of   address   the
    difficulties which confront the Appellant in the context of  dependency
    had been set out above" (paragraph 24).

 9. The final conclusion of the judge was that,

         "In the light of  the  state  of  the  evidence  to  which  I  have
         referred, I do not find that the  correspondence  attached  to  the
         Appellant's bundle advances the case on  behalf  of  the  Appellant
         given the paucity of corroborative  documentary  evidence  both  in
         relation to what took place in Nigeria as to  the  support  of  the
         Appellant and  to  what  has  transpired  in  the  United  Kingdom"
         (paragraph 29).

    The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application place reliance upon the case of Dauhoo  (EEA
    Regulations - Reg. 8(2)) Mauritius [2012] UKUT  79.   This  is  to  the
    effect that the person applying must show either current residence with
    the Sponsor or current dependency on the Sponsor.  The judge applied an
    incorrect test in relation to current residence.  Moreover,  dependency
    did not have to be of necessity.

11. On 16th October 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

12. At the  hearing  before  me,  Mr  Ruparelia,  a  legal  representative,
    appeared on behalf of the Appellant.  He placed  reliance  upon  Dauhoo
    (in ground 4 of the Grounds of Appeal).  He also drew my  attention  to
    the skeleton argument.  He pointed out the  judge's  observation  that,
    "The essence of the case is that it is claimed that the  Appellant  has
    been and is dependent on his uncle" (paragraph  18).   His  submissions
    before me were that there were a number  of  documents,  such  as  bank
    statements, utility bills, "at GNK of the  Respondent's  bundle"  which
    were overlooked by the judge.

13.  The  entirety  of  the  evidence  before  the  judge  established  the
    Appellant's eligibility under Regulation 8.  There were pay slips  from
    the uncle which showed his financial commitments to the Appellant.  All
    of this was overlooked.  There was enough that  the  Appellant  had  to
    show his dependency on his uncle.

14. For his part, Mr Smart submitted that  the  Appellant  was  seeking  to
    establish that he was an "extended family member" and under the case of
    Dauhoo, he had to establish both a prior dependency  before  coming  to
    the UK as well as a current dependency after coming  to  the  UK.   The
    judge did consider all the evidence.  He referred to  the  "paucity  of
    corroborative evidence" especially "in relation to what took  place  in
    Nigeria" but also "to  what  has  transpired  in  the  United  Kingdom"
    (paragraph 29).

15. The fact  was,  as  the  judge  himself  fully  appreciated,  that  the
    Appellant was only "able to draw my attention to one document to  which
    I have referred above" (see  paragraph  20).   This  document,  in  the
    Appellant's bundle, is very difficult to decipher.  The  same  copy  in
    the Respondent's bundle is easier to read.  However, at this  stage  Mr
    Ruparelia helpfully intervened to say that he did have an  original  of
    this document which he could read out.

16. He pointed out that this was a remittance sum for January 2010  of  �65
    from the uncle to the Appellant.  (It was accepted by all parties  that
    �5 of this would be taken up in administrative costs so  that  the  sum
    that was being remitted was �60).  Mr Smart submitted that one document
    was insufficient to show dependency.

17.  Second,  the  Appellant  had  been  asked  (at  paragraph  9  of   the
    determination) the identity of his  financial  Sponsor  and  the  judge
    records that, "The Appellant replied mum and  dad  were  the  financial
    Sponsors" (paragraph 9).  Given that it had been the  Appellant's  case
    that he was financially dependent upon his uncle this  gave  a  lie  to
    such a claim of dependency.

18. In reply, Mr Ruparelia submitted that it was clear even from the single
    document that existed that money transfers were taking place at a  time
    when the Appellant was in the home country of  Nigeria  because  it  is
    dated January 2010, and the Appellant entered the UK in January 2011.

19. Second, there was in the Respondent's bundle (at L1), a statement dated
    26th September 2013, from Ucho Onwuzo, that the Appellant had  received
    money from his uncle,  Mr  Sunny  Onwuzo,  through  Ucho  Onwuzo.   The
    Sponsor was Mr Sunny Onwuzo, an uncle of the Appellant.  Mr Ucho Onwuzo
    was another uncle of the  Appellant.   The  statement  reads  that  the
    sponsoring uncle "has sent money to me from Germany as well as  the  UK
    on different occasions via money transfer  organisations  such  as  the
    Western Union".  I noted that no such official  evidence  was  produced
    before Judge Hollingworth.

No Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law, such  that  I  should
    set aside the decision.  The  determination  of  the  judge  is  clear,
    comprehensive, and factually wholly correct.  It is absolutely  correct
    that there is a "paucity of evidence".  It is correct  that  the  uncle
    did not attend the hearing to explain the extent of his support for the
    Appellant.  It is correct that the evidence existed for  the  judge  to
    conclude that the Appellant's evidence was unconvincing and lacking  in
    plausibility.  It is also correct that the  Appellant's  statement  "is
    remarkable for its brevity" (paragraph 23).

21. The plain fact is that only one document exists and even  that  to  the
    tune of only �60 as the value of the remittance to the  Appellant  from
    Sunny Onwuzo.  One remittance is a gift of money from an uncle who  has
    managed to acquire residence and employment abroad for  a  relative  or
    relatives back at home.

22. It is not evidence of dependency.  The burden of so showing  rested  on
    the Appellant.  In the circumstances, it was  not  discharged  and  the
    judge was correct to conclude as he did as a matter of  law  and  as  a
    matter of fact.

Decision

23. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's  decision.   The
    determination shall stand.

24. No anonymity order is made.
