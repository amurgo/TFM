Centre


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW


1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Shamash to allow  the  appeal  of
    the respondent against the refusal by the Secretary of State  to  grant
    her application for asylum, humanitarian protection and leave to remain
    on Article 3 grounds.

2.   Permission was granted on the basis  that  it  was  arguable  that  the
    judge misdirected herself, firstly, in her approach to  the  appeal  by
    failing to follow the guidelines applicable to further appeals in terms
    of Devaseelan by assessing the previous determinations  for  errors  of
    law as opposed to considering them as a starting point and going on  to
    consider new evidence.  Secondly, it  was  arguable  that  the  judge's
    findings in relation to the respondent's sur place activities may  have
    been infected by  the  judge's  assessment  of  credibility  given  the
    arguable failings of the judge to follow Devaseelan  and,  thirdly,  in
    her assessment of the respondent's case on medical grounds.

3.   From now on the respondent will be referred to  as  the  applicant  for
    ease of reference.  The applicant is a citizen of the DRC born on  [  ]
    1947.  She appealed against the decision of  the  respondent  dated  19
    April 2007 to refuse to grant her asylum.

4.   This case has a long  and  protracted  history.   The  applicant  first
    claimed asylum when she entered the United Kingdom  in  February  2008.
    In a decision dated 18 June 2008 Immigration Judge Edwards refused  her
    appeal.   The  applicant  appealed  against  this  decision  and   made
    applications for High Court reviews on 1 August 2008  and  10  November
    2008.  Her appeal rights were deemed exhausted  on  10  November  2008.
    She submitted further representations on 27 November  2008  which  were
    refused on 5 October 2009.  She  made  further  representations  on  23
    October 2010 which were refused on 20 February  2015.   Following  this
    she made further representations on 27 March 2015, which  were  refused
    on 15 June 2015.  A further appeal was heard  and  dismissed  by  Judge
    Povey on 15 February 2016 based on fresh medical evidence.   The  basis
    for this appeal was the fresh evidence from Professor Seddon  going  to
    the credibility of the account that the appellant  gave  at  her  first
    hearing in 2008, and further evidence  of  the  applicant's  sur  place
    activities.  Further representations were lodged on 12 December 2016.

5.   Judge Shamash said  at  paragraph  3  that  at  the  beginning  of  the
    hearing, it was agreed that the findings of fact which formed the basis
    for the credibility findings in the determination of Judge Edwards were
    the starting point, Devaseelan (Second Appeals, ECHR, Extra-Territorial
    Effect) Sri  Lanka  [2002]  UKIAT  00702.   However,  where  there  was
    evidence  which  undermined  the  factual  basis  of  the   credibility
    findings, that evidence could properly be taken into account.

6.   There are two  strands  to  the  applicant's  application.   The  first
    strand was based on the past persecution she suffered in the DRC.   The
    first strand formed the basis of her first appeal before Judge  Edwards
    and was based on arrests in the DRC as a result of  her  membership  of
    the MLC.  The applicant claimed that she was an MLC activist.  She  was
    arrested for the first  time  on  27  July  2006,  just  prior  to  the
    Presidential election, when she attended an MLC  rally  in  support  of
    Jean-Pierre Bemba at the Tata  Raphaï¿½l  Stadium.   During  that  rally,
    police and demonstrators clashed and she was arrested with  others  and
    held in custody for four days.

7.   The second incident occurred on 25 August 2006  when  she  claims  that
    six soldiers entered her home and raped her in front  of  her  nephews.
    Although they stole her television and radio, they did not  search  the
    house.  Following the rape she was held in custody for two weeks.   She
    was released on 9 September 2006.  The third  arrest  occurred  shortly
    after Christmas in 2006 when she claims that she was arrested  by  four
    men in civilian clothing who questioned her about her membership of the
    MLC.  Her house was searched, pro- Bemba material was found and she was
    arrested.   She  was  detained  until  February  2008  and  during  her
    detention, she was tortured and systematically raped. She was  released
    on 7 February 2008 when a guard came to her cell at night and  led  her
    out of the prison.

8.   The second strand to her application was a sur  place  claim  based  on
    her current profile in the United Kingdom.  This claim was  raised  for
    the first time before Judge Povey.  It related to  her  activities  for
    the Congolese  Support  Group,  which  is  an  opposition  organisation
    operating in the Diaspora calling for regime change in the DRC.  At the
    appeal before Judge Povey, the applicant adduced  medical  evidence  of
    posttraumatic stress disorder and of  scarring.  The  medical  evidence
    before Judge Edwards was different - the  applicant  had  diabetes  and
    vaginal infection.

9.   Judge Shamash heard evidence from Barbara Gehrels from the  Notre  Dame
    Refugee Centre.  She had made a diagnosis of PTSD and because of it had
    referred  the  applicant  to   Freedom   from   Torture   for   chronic
    posttraumatic  stress  counselling.   The  judge  also  heard  from  Mr
    Tongomo, who is the chairman of the Congolese Support Group.

10.  The judge at paragraph 69  under  a  heading  "Finding  on  Preliminary
    Issue" stated as follows:

         "I accept that the starting point in a  decision  where  there  has
         been a previous finding of  fact  is  Devaseelan  and  I  start  by
         considering the submissions made at the beginning  of  the  hearing
         that there was nothing in the report prepared by David Seddon which
         would be sufficient to set aside the decisions of IJ Edwards and IJ
         Povey and which would entitle me to make  fresh  findings  of  fact
         based on credibility.  Having heard submissions from Mr  Eaton  and
         Mr Gilbert and having read David Seddon's report carefully, and the
         statements of Mr Tongomo and Ms Gehrels, I consider that  there  is
         now evidence which  demonstrates  that  the  findings  made  by  IJ
         Edwards and IJ Povey are inconsistent with background evidence  and
         that I should consider the findings of IJ Edwards and IJ  Povey  in
         light of the fresh evidence."


11.  However, Devaseelan states as follows:

         "37.   ...    The   first   Adjudicator's   determination    stands
             (unchallenged,  or  not   successfully   challenged)   as   an
             assessment of the claim the appellant was then making, at  the
             time of that determination.  It is not binding on  the  second
             Adjudicator; but, on the other hand, the second Adjudicator is
             not hearing an appeal against it.  As  an  assessment  of  the
             matters that were  before  the  first  Adjudicator  it  should
             simply be regarded as unquestioned.  It  may  be  built  upon,
             and, as a result, the outcome of the hearing before the second
             Adjudicator may be quite different from what might  have  been
             expected from a reading of the first determination only.   But
             it is not the second Adjudicator's role to consider  arguments
             intended to undermine the first Adjudicator's determination."


12.  Devaseelan goes on to say:

         "If before the second Adjudicator the  appellant  relies  on  facts
         that are not materially different  from  those  put  to  the  first
         Adjudicator, and proposes to  support  the  claim  by  what  is  in
         essence the same evidence as that available  to  the  appellant  at
         that time, the second  Adjudicator  should  regard  the  issues  as
         settled by the  first  Adjudicator's  determination  and  make  his
         findings in line with that determination rather than  allowing  the
         matter to be relitigated.  ..."

13.  I find in light of the submissions made by  Mr  Kotas  that  the  judge
    failed to follow the guidelines in Devaseelan by assessing the previous
    determinations for errors of law as opposed to considering  them  as  a
    starting point.  I was not persuaded by Ms Robinson's submission to the
    contrary.

14.  I shall proceed to give instances in  the  judge's  decision  where,  I
    find she was conducting an error of law exercise.  At  [74]  the  judge
    said that Judge Edwards' decision dealt with an inconsistency over  the
    date of the applicant's first arrest.  The inconsistency arose  from  a
    difference  in  the  applicant's  account  as  between  her   screening
    interview on the one hand and the AIR and the applicant's oral evidence
    on the other.  Although this was not ordinarily a matter that should be
    revisited, the judge nevertheless felt it apposite to make a number  of
    observations.  She stated: "Neither IJ Edwards nor IJ Povey  approached
    the account given in the screening interview with caution".  A  further
    example is at [73] where the judge said that in  her  view  IJ  Edwards
    attached too much weight to the discrepancies between question 1 and  2
    of the screening interview and the  AIR  and  all  of  the  applicant's
    subsequent accounts that had been broadly consistent with the AIR.  She
    went on to  say  that  the  judge  failed  to  approach  the  screening
    interview in line with the authorities.  Again, this is an instance  of
    the judge conducting an error of law exercise.  In any event, weight is
    a matter for a judge and the judge could not have been  criticised  for
    placing weight on a matter that was before him.

15.  Another example is at [74] where  the  judge  stated  that  IJ  Edwards
    disregarded  all  of  the  evidence  which  was  consistent  with   the
    applicant's account and focused on two  factors.   At  [75]  the  judge
    stated that it is of significance that IJ Edwards did not at any  point
    mention the rapes that the applicant described  in  very  great  detail
    during her AIR but had simply focused on the theft  of  the  television
    and radio.  In other words, she was saying that IJ  Edwards  failed  to
    have regard to material issues.  At [76] the judge  states  that  taken
    together with the applicant's claim that she was raped and tortured  in
    custody, the applicant's account was  consistent  with  the  background
    evidence.  However, this presupposes that she  was  raped.   The  judge
    ignored the previous judges' rejection of that evidence.

16.  At [77] the judge said: "It  is  regrettable  that  IJ  Povey  did  not
    attach any significant weight to the evidence  of  scarring  which  was
    assessed in line with the Istanbul Protocol as highly  consistent  with
    the appellant's account."   However,  the  judge  fails  to  take  into
    account that the medical evidence before IJ Povey was  not  challenged.
    An appeal against IJ Povey's decision was not successful.


17.  The judge said at [81] that IJ Edwards did not once  mention  that  the
    applicant was raped, but this was wrong.  At paragraphs 15(b)  and  (c)
    of Judge Edwards' decision he recorded the  applicant's  evidence  that
    she had been raped on 25 August 2006 and was  raped  repeatedly  during
    her detention close to Christmas 2006.  In his decision at paragraph 25
    Judge Edwards did not believe the applicant's account of the rapes.

18.  These instances demonstrated  that  the  judge  was  not  applying  the
    Devaseelan principles as held by her.  She was criticising the  judges'
    findings and conducting an error of law exercise in  respect  of  those
    findings. In so doing, I find that the judge committed a material error
    of law.

19.  I find that the judge also erred in law in  her  consideration  of  the
    medical evidence.  She failed  to  acknowledge  that  Judge  Povey  had
    conducted a full hearing on the medical  documents.   Judge  Povey  had
    before  him  Dr  Moser's  report  which   addressed   the   applicant's
    psychological  and  physical  issues;  at  paragraph  54  he  considers
    Professor Katona's report.  The judge's findings at [80] were  findings
    based on matters that had  already  been  considered  by  Judge  Povey.
    Judge Povey had given full and cogent reasons for his findings  against
    which the applicant had  not  successfully  appealed.   Those  findings
    remained unchallenged.  I find that Judge Shamash relitigated  all  the
    issues without treating the decisions by IJ Edwards and IJ Povey as the
    starting point.  The  only  real  evidence  before  Judge  Shamash  was
    Professor Seddon's report.  However, in light of  the  material  errors
    committed by the judge, I find that her decision on that report  cannot
    stand.

20.  There is a further error of law that was committed by the judge in  her
    consideration of the medical evidence.  The judge made assumptions  not
    supported by evidence that the applicant would face  a  serious,  rapid
    and irreversible decline in her condition if removed to the  DRC  which
    would result in intense suffering  and  significant  decrease  in  life
    expectancy.  I accept the argument in the grounds that given  the  lack
    of evidence to support a programme of ongoing treatment in the UK, or a
    prognosis  in  regard  to  the  outcome  of  her  condition,  it  is  a
    misdirection to conclude that any removal to the DRC would  cause  such
    results, given that there  has  been  no  indication  as  to  what  the
    applicant can expect if she remains in the UK.

21.  That argument was in respect of the judge's  finding  at  paragraph  87
    where she finds that the high threshold in Paposhvili  v  Belgium  (App
    41738/10) has been met.  I was informed by Mr Kotas that  the  Tribunal
    has issued a decision in EA & Ors (Article 3 medical cases - Paposhvili
    not applicable) Afghanistan [2017] UKUT 445.  He said  that  this  case
    says that Paposhvili has no application in this jurisdiction.

22.  Ms Robinson submitted that the Court of Appeal is in January  going  to
    hold a hearing on a lead case which raises the Paposhvili point.   That
    may be the case but in this instant appeal I find that at [86] and [87]
    the judge gave cursory and inadequate reasons for concluding  that  the
    applicant would suffer serious medical health issues  were  she  to  be
    moved to the DRC.

23.  I find that the judge also erred in her assessment of  the  applicant's
    sur place claim. There was no reference by her to the findings made  by
    Judge Povey as being the starting point.  The  judge  decided  the  sur
    place claim as if it was being raised before her for the first time.

24.  For the above reasons, I find that the judge materially  erred  in  law
    and that her decision cannot stand.

25.  The applicant's appeal is remitted to be reheard by a different  judge;
    not IJ Shamash, IJ Povey or IJ Edwards.

Notice of Decision

The applicant's appeal is remitted to  Taylor  House  to  be  reheard  by  a
different judge.
