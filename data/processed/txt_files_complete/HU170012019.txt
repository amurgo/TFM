For the Appellant:     Mr M. Biggs, Counsel, instructed by Connaught Law
For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Following a hearing on 16 April 2021, in a decision and  reasons  dated
    26 May 2021, I found that a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Beach
    promulgated on 8 July 2020 involved the making of an error of law,  and
    set it aside, with all findings  of  fact  preserved.   The  judge  had
    dismissed an appeal under section 82 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 against a decision of the Secretary of State  dated
    8 October 2019 to refuse the appellant's human rights  claim,  made  on
    the basis of his claimed ten years' continuous lawful residence.

 2. My decision of 26 May 2021 may be found in the Annex to this decision.

 3. As may be seen from my "error of law decision" at [35],  following  the
    hearing in the Upper Tribunal on  16  April  2021,  I  invited  written
    submissions on the impact, if any, of Muneeb  Asif  (Paragraph  276B  -
    disregard -  previous  overstaying)  [2021]  UKUT  0096  (IAC)  on  the
    parties' submissions in the case.  I am grateful to Mr  Biggs  for  his
    written submissions in response, received on 10 May 2021.  There was no
    response from the Secretary of State.

 4. For the reasons given at [39] of my error of law decision,  having  set
    aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  in  light  of  the
    preserved findings of fact and the law as clarified  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Hoque v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2020]
    EWCA Civ 1357, and by this tribunal in Muneeb Asif, my provisional view
    was that the appeal should be allowed on human rights grounds,  on  the
    basis that the appellant met the requirements for paragraph 276B of the
    Immigration Rules.  Pursuant to the  clarification  provided  by  Hoque
    and, in particular Muneeb  Asif,  which  confirmed  that  "disregarded"
    overstaying amounts to positive residence for the purposes of  accruing
    ten years' continuous lawful residence, I explained that I  was  minded
    to allow the appeal.

 5. In order to secure the greatest possible fairness to  the  parties,  in
    particular the Secretary of State, I gave the parties  14  days  within
    which to make any submissions concerning that proposed  approach.   The
    appellant, not surprisingly, did not object.  The  Secretary  of  State
    did not respond, as was within her gift to do so, of course.

 6. I have considered whether it is necessary to reconvene the  parties  in
    order justly and fairly to dispose of this appeal.   In  light  of  the
    position adopted by the Secretary of  State  on  both  occasions  post-
    hearing submissions were sought, I consider  that  there  would  be  no
    reason to reconvene the hearing,  with  the  ensuing  cost,  delay  and
    impact on the  tribunal's  resources,  in  light  of  the  unchallenged
    findings of fact, and the position adopted by the Secretary of State.

 7. Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the accompanying error  of  law
    decision, and pursuant to the preserved findings of fact, I allow  this
    appeal on human rights grounds.  The appellant meets  the  requirements
    of  paragraph  276B  of  the  Immigration  Rules,   pursuant   to   the
    understanding of that provision as clarified  by  the  two  authorities
    referred to  above.   I  provided  the  Secretary  of  State  with  the
    opportunity to make submissions contending that  a  different  approach
    should be adopted, and she declined to do so.

 8. I remake the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  allowing  the
    appeal.





Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

This has been a remote hearing which has been consented to  /  not  objected
to by the parties.  The form of remote hearing was  V  (video).  A  face  to
face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing.

The documents that I was  referred  to  were  the  grounds  of  appeal,  the
appellant's written submissions dated  3  December  2020,  the  respondent's
written submissions dated 4 December 2020, and the decision  of  the  First-
tier Tribunal, the contents of which I have recorded.

The order made is described at the end of these reasons.

The parties said this about the process: they were content  the  proceedings
had been conducted fairly in their remote form.

 1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Beach
    promulgated on 8 July 2020 dismissing an appeal  by  the  appellant,  a
    citizen of India born  28  August  1975,  against  a  decision  of  the
    respondent dated 8 October 2019 to refuse his human rights  claim  made
    in the form of an application for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  under
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.

 2. The hearing before me took place remotely in order to guard against the
    spread of Covid-19.  Both parties confirmed at the end of  the  hearing
    that they were content that the proceedings had been conducted fairly.

Factual background

 3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  16  September  2009  with
    leave to remain as a student.  On the  unchallenged  findings  of  fact
    reached by the First-tier Tribunal, he held leave to  remain  until  28
    November 2018.  That was the date upon  which  proceedings  challenging
    the refusal of an application he submitted on 1 April 2014 for  further
    leave to remain as a student was finally determined.   On  12  December
    2018, fourteen days after the final determination of his 1  April  2014
    application, the appellant  submitted  a  further  application,  which,
    following two variations, led to leave being granted to  the  appellant
    as a Tier 4 dependent partner on 30 April 2019.

 4. On 1 October 2019, the appellant made a human rights claim in the  form
    of an application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  under  the  long
    residence provisions of the Immigration Rules.  Paragraph  276B,  under
    which the appellant applied, requires  applicants  to  demonstrate  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence, as well as to meet other  criteria.
    That application was refused on 8 October 2019, and it was that refusal
    decision that was under appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. The appellant's application for indefinite leave to remain was  refused
    on the basis that he had not  accrued  ten  years'  continuous,  lawful
    residence for the purposes of paragraph 276B.  His relevant immigration
    history is as follows:

|                       |as a Tier 4 student, valid until 31  |

|                       |are given for the appellant's removal|

|                       |leave on the basis of his family     |
|                       |life, and again on 10 April 2019 to  |
|                       |the spouse of a settled person, and  |
|                       |again on 30 April 2019 to a Tier 4   |

|8 October 2019         |Application refused (decision under  |
|                       |appeal in these proceedings)         |


    I deal with the events marked * at paragraph 27, below.

 6. The basis upon which the respondent initially refused  the  application
    in her letter of 8 October 2019  differs  from  the  position  she  was
    subsequently to adopt before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  in  particular
    concerning the appellant's immigration  history.  Whereas  the  refusal
    letter dated 8 October 2019 contended that the  appellant  was  without
    leave from 13 April 2014 to 25 September 2019, the  presenting  officer
    before the First-tier Tribunal accepted that the appellant  held  leave
    to remain from 22 October 2013 until the final determination of  his  1
    April 2014 application, on 28 November 2018.  See [35] and [36].

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The judge reached a number of unchallenged findings which,  when  taken
    together, amount to finding that the appellant  held  leave  to  remain
    from 16 September 2009 until 28 November 2018.

 8. At [19], the judge recorded a concession by the presenting officer that
    the appellant held valid leave to remain, extended by section 3C of the
    Immigration Act 1971 ("the 1971 Act"), from  13  April  2014  until  28
    November 2018.

 9. At [50], the judge found that an application made by the appellant  for
    further leave to remain on 12 July 2012 had not been out of time,  even
    though the appellant last held leave to remain on 4  May  2012.   Under
    the regime then in force, as set out  by  the  judge  at  [44]  of  her
    decision, a right of appeal only attached to a decision which  had  the
    effect of leaving a person without leave to remain.    The  judge  held
    that, because on 30 January 2013 the appellant  was  found  by  a  duty
    judge of the First-tier Tribunal to enjoy a right of appeal against the
    15 November 2012 refusal, the application which led  to  that  refusal,
    made on 2 July 2012, must have been in time.

10. The judge did not have a copy of the duty judge's decision finding that
    the First-tier Tribunal enjoyed jurisdiction to hear  the  appeal,  but
    she did note  that,  in  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Mitchell promulgated on 6 June 2013 determining the appeal against  the
    15 November 2012 refusal, First-tier Tribunal Judge Mitchell  noted  at
    [3] that the Secretary of State  did  not  raise  a  jurisdiction-based
    objection to the appeal proceeding on that occasion.  Judge Beach  said
    this, at [50]:

         "I find that it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal had found  that  the  appellant  made  an  in-time,  valid
         application for further leave to remain, that the refusal  of  that
         leave to remain application led to a valid right of appeal and that
         the respondent did not challenge any of  those  findings.  I  find,
         therefore, that there was not a break in the appellant's continuous
         residence between 5 May 2012 and 2  July  2012  when  he  made  his
         application for leave to remain."

11. The effect of Judge Beach's finding that the 2  July  2012  application
    had been made 'in time' was that it treated  the  appellant  as  having
    enjoyed continuous, lawful residence from his entry in  September  2009
    until 28 November 2018.

12. The operative reasons for the judge dismissing the  appeal  related  to
    the impact of the appellant being without leave from 28  November  2018
    until 12 December 2018, the date upon which  he  submitted  what  would
    eventually become a successful  application  for  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    dependent.  The judge held that, pursuant to the then understanding  of
    the law in light of Masum Ahmed v the Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2019] EWCA Civ 1070, the period during which the  appellant
    did not hold leave to remain prior to the  submission  the  application
    was fatal to his case.  Having quoted extensively from  [15]  of  Masum
    Ahmed, at [53] she held:

         "Even if the period of  14  days  between  becoming  appeal  rights
         exhausted and making a new application were disregarded, this  does
         not convert the period without leave (which ended on  25  September
         2019 when the appellant was granted leave to remain in the  UK)  to
         'lawful  residence'  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  276B.   The
         arguments put forward on behalf of the  appellant  as  to  why  the
         Court of Appeal incorrectly decided [R (oao Ahmed) v  Secretary  of
         State for the  Home  Department  (para  276B  -  ten  years  lawful
         residence) [2019] UKUT 10 (IAC)] have, in effect,  been  considered
         by the Court  of  Appeal  [in  Masum  Ahmed]  who  found  that  the
         provisions were  freestanding  provisions.  The  appellant  cannot,
         therefore, meet the requirements of paragraph 276B as a  result  of
         his lack of continuous residence between 28 November 2018  and  the
         grant of leave on 25 September 2019  or  alternatively,  having  10
         years' residence in the UK as at 16  September  2019  (because  his
         leave to remain had not been lawful leave throughout that time)."

13. At [54], the judge also found  that  the  respondent's  Long  Residence
    guidance did not assist the appellant.  An argument had  been  advanced
    that provision made in the  guidance  of  the  respondent  to  exercise
    discretion in favour of certain applicants in the case of out  of  time
    applications.  The judge found that, on her understanding of  the  gaps
    in the appellant's lawful residence from 4 May 2012 to 22 October 2013,
    the respondent would  not  necessarily  have  exercised  discretion  in
    favour of the appellant.  She concluded the paragraph stating:

         "This was not a case, therefore, where it  can  clearly  be  stated
         that had discretion been exercised, it would have been exercised in
         favour of the appellant."

Permission to appeal

14. The appellant advanced two grounds of appeal.  The first contended that
    the judge misapplied the Long Residence guidance, which suggested  that
    short periods of overstaying in between periods of extant leave  and  a
    subsequently  successful  application  could  be  the  subject   of   a
    favourable exercise of discretion.  The second  ground  contended  that
    the judge was wrong to find against the appellant on the basis of Masum
    Ahmed, in light of a concession made by the Secretary of State in  what
    would later become Hoque v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    [2020] EWCA Civ 1357 that Masum Ahmed was wrong decided.  Hoque was not
    handed down until after the application for permission  to  appeal  had
    been made, but the appellant had obtained a copy of  the  Secretary  of
    State's supplementary skeleton argument dated 22 July 2020 in which the
    concession was said to have been made: see paragraph 19.

15. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Macleman  on
    both grounds, on both grounds, but primarily  upon  the  basis  of  the
    respondent's concession in Hoque.

Submissions

16. The appellant provided written submissions dated 3 December  2020,  and
    the  respondent  provided  written  submissions  on  4  December  2020,
    pursuant to directions given  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Keith  on  18
    November 2020.

17. Mr Biggs submitted that the Court of  Appeal  in  Hoque  is  positively
    dispositive of  the  appellant's  appeal,  on  the  basis  of  what  he
    described as the preserved, unchallenged findings of fact of the  judge
    at [50].  This is "book-ended" overstaying, which, provided  the  terms
    of rule 39E are met, may be "disregarded".  There had been  no  express
    challenge to the judge's findings at [50] by the  respondent;  although
    in her written submissions of  4  December  2020  she  appeared  to  be
    critical of them, she did not do so in a formal rule 24 notice, and nor
    did the apparently critical observations relating to those findings  in
    the 4  December  2020  submissions  expressly  seek  to  challenge  the
    findings, in a manner compatible by the Court of Appeal in Secretary of
    State for the Home Department v Devani [2020] EWCA  Civ  612  at  [31],
    concerning the obligation on a successful party before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to challenge a ground upon which they were not  successful  by
    means of a notice under  rule  24  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008.

18. Mr Tufan submitted that, even post-Hoque, the appellant cannot point to
    ten years' continuous lawful residence.

Legal framework

19. Paragraph 39E of the Immigration Rules, concerning  certain  exceptions
    for overstayers, provided, at the time  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision:

         "39E. This paragraph applies where:

         (1) the application was made within  14  days  of  the  applicant's
         leave expiring and the Secretary of State considers that there  was
         a good  reason  beyond  the  control  of  the  applicant  or  their
         representative, provided  in  or  with  the  application,  why  the
         application could not be made in-time; or

         (2) the application was made:

             (a) following the refusal of a previous application for  leave
             which was made in-time; and

             (b) within 14 days of:

                  (i) the refusal of the previous application for leave; or

                  (ii) the expiry of any leave extended by section 3C of the
                  Immigration Act 1971; or

                  (iii) the expiry of the time-limit for making  an  in-time
                  application for administrative  review  or  appeal  (where
                  applicable); or

                  (iv) any administrative review or appeal being  concluded,
                  withdrawn or abandoned or lapsing."

20. Paragraph 276B, concerning indefinite leave to  remain  on  grounds  of
    long residence, provided at  the  time  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision:

         "276B. The requirements to be met by an  applicant  for  indefinite
         leave to remain on the ground  of  long  residence  in  the  United
         Kingdom are that:

             (i) (a) he  has  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
             residence in the United Kingdom.

             (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons
             why it would be undesirable for him  to  be  given  indefinite
             leave to remain on the ground of long residence,  taking  into
             account his:

                  (a) age; and

                  (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and

                  (c)  personal  history,  including   character,   conduct,
                  associations and employment record; and

                  (d) domestic circumstances; and

                  (e) compassionate circumstances; and

                  (f) any representations received on the  person's  behalf;
                  and

             (iii) the applicant  does  not  fall  for  refusal  under  the
             general grounds for refusal.

             (iv) the applicant has demonstrated  sufficient  knowledge  of
             the English language and sufficient knowledge  about  life  in
             the United Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.

             (v) the  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
             immigration laws, except that, where paragraph  39E  of  these
             Rules applies, any  current  period  of  overstaying  will  be
             disregarded.  Any  previous  period  of  overstaying   between
             periods of leave will also be disregarded where -

                  (a) the previous application was made before  24  November
                  2016 and within 28 days of the expiry of leave; or

                  (b) the further  application  was  made  on  or  after  24
                  November 2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied."

Discussion

21. By way of a preliminary observation, I queried with the parties whether
    the First-tier Tribunal, and indeed this tribunal, had jurisdiction  to
    hear this case. The Secretary of State refused the human  rights  claim
    in circumstances which she considered to attract  a  right  of  appeal.
    However,  the  appellant  already  held  leave  to  remain   upon   his
    application for indefinite leave to remain being refused,  raising  the
    question as to whether the refusal decision amounted to the refusal  of
    a "human rights claim" as defined in section 113  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").   Certainly,  if  the
    appellant  had  been  granted  some  other  form  of  leave  after  the
    institution of these appeal proceedings, section 104(4A)  of  the  2002
    Act provides that the appeal "shall be  treated  as  abandoned".   That
    does not cover the position where, as here, upon  the  refusal  of  the
    putative human rights claim, the appellant  already  held  a  different
    form of leave.

22. Section 113(1) of the 2002 Act provides:

         "'human rights claim' means  a  claim  made  by  a  person  to  the
         Secretary of State at a place designated by the Secretary of  State
         that to remove the person from or require him to leave  the  United
         Kingdom or to refuse him entry into the  United  Kingdom  would  be
         unlawful under section 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  (c.  42)
         (public authority not to act contrary to Convention)..."

23. This tribunal and the Court of  Appeal  has  recently  considered  this
    issue.  The President of this tribunal held in R (oao Mujahid) v First-
    tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)  and  the  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department (refusal of human  rights  claim)  [2020]
    UKUT 85 (IAC), at [31] and [31]:

         "31. [...]    It is clear from  the  definition  of  'human  rights
         claim' in section 113(1) of the 2002 Act that the presumed  removal
         of  an  individual  from,  or  the  presumed  requirement  on  that
         individual to leave, the United Kingdom is an essential element  in
         order for there to be an appeal.  A person who makes a human rights
         claim is asserting that they (or someone connected with them) have,
         for whatever reason, a right recognised by the ECHR,  which  is  of
         such a kind that removing that person or requiring  them  to  leave
         would be a violation of that right.  In the  case  of  a  qualified
         right, such as Article 8, a violation may result from the fact that
         it would be disproportionate to remove or to require the person  to
         leave.

         32.           Accordingly, the refusal of a human rights claim made
         by a person who is in the United Kingdom can occur only  where  the
         Secretary of State's case, in response to the claim,  is  that  she
         does not consider her obligations under section 6 of the  1998  Act
         require her to respond to the claim by recognising the human  right
         to remain in the United Kingdom  and  so  granting  the  individual
         leave to remain." (Emphasis added)

24. The above judgment of the President was recently upheld by the Court of
    Appeal, which did not disturb any of his reasoning: see [2021] EWCA Civ
    449.

25. I consider that,  by  refusing  the  appellant's  paragraph  276B  long
    residence indefinite leave to remain human rights claim, the  Secretary
    of State had "decided to refuse a human rights claim" for the  purposes
    of section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act.  Although at  the  time  when  the
    appellant made the human rights claim  he  held  a  different  form  of
    limited leave to remain, he maintained through making the human  rights
    claim that his putative removal, or a putative requirement to leave the
    country, would be a breach of the UK's obligations under Article  8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights.  In  response  to  that  claim
    (see Mujahid in the UT at [32]), the Secretary of State maintained that
    her obligations under  the  Convention  were  not  such  that  she  was
    required to grant leave to remain  to  the  appellant,  such  that  the
    statutory criteria for a right of appeal to this tribunal were met.

26. In my judgment it is significant that not only  did  the  Secretary  of
    State  refuse  the  human  rights  claim  in  circumstances  which  she
    considered to attract a right of appeal, she did not raise jurisdiction-
    based concerns before the First-tier Tribunal, and did not do so before
    this tribunal.  I consider that she was correct to do.   There  was  an
    appealable refusal of a human rights claim, such that a right of appeal
    has been generated.

Discussion

27. Before considering the import of Hoque,  I  must  address  the  judge's
    findings that the  appellant  held  leave  to  remain  for  the  period
    covering 4 May 2012 to 22 October 2013.  The  relevant  stages  in  the
    chronology are marked*.  Judge Beach's findings at [50] were  based  on
    the First-tier Tribunal accepting that it had the jurisdiction to  hear
    an appeal against the 15 November 2012  refusal,  even  though  on  the
    Secretary of State's chronology the application leading to that refusal
    was submitted 'out of time.'  Neither Judge Beach nor I have  seen  the
    duty judge's 30 January 2021 decision accepting  jurisdiction.    Those
    currently representing the appellant had been unable to obtain  a  copy
    from the First-tier Tribunal: see [22]  and  [45].   The  Secretary  of
    State has not volunteered a copy.

28. My preliminary view was that this was a troubling finding of fact.   If
    the application had been submitted out of time, it was difficult to see
    how it could be open to any tribunal  to  find  otherwise,  still  less
    conclude that the individual concerned had held leave to remain at  the
    time.  However, my considered view is that that was a finding  of  fact
    open to the judge to reach, for the following reasons.

        a. It is not difficult to envisage a basis upon which it would have
           been open to the duty judge to reach the finding.  For  example,
           there may have been an issue with service of the notice that led
           to the appellant becoming appeal rights-exhausted on 4 May 2012.
            There could also have been concerns surrounding the  lawfulness
           of the underlying refusal decision on 16 February 2012, in light
           of rulings at the time about decisions taken under section 47 of
           the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006;

        b. The Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal is
           a specialist tribunal with particular  expertise  in  procedural
           matters such as this;

        c. The Secretary of State did not apply to  judicially  review  the
           duty judge's decision;

        d. At the  appeal  before  Judge  Mitchell  on  31  May  2013,  the
           Secretary of State did  not  contest  the  jurisdiction  of  the
           tribunal: see [3] of Judge Mitchell's decision promulgated on  6
           June 2013;

        e. I have not been told that the Secretary  of  State  applied  for
           permission to appeal against the decision of Judge Mitchell;

        f. The Secretary of State did  not  seek  to  cross-appeal  against
           Judge Beach's findings concerning the  application  having  been
           submitted in-time, nor provide this tribunal with a copy of  the
           duty judge's  decision,  or  any  other  relevant  details,  for
           example notes from her Case Information Database.  The Secretary
           of State did not, for example, submit a notice under rule 24  of
           the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, pursuant  to
           the process  described  in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
           Department v Devani [2020] EWCA Civ 612  at  [31].   In  written
           submissions submitted in advance of  the  hearing,  but  not  in
           accordance with rule 24, the Secretary of  State  asserted  that
           the appellant did not have leave to remain from 4 May 2012 until
           22 October 2013, with no supporting reasoning.   Before  me,  Mr
           Tufan very fairly accepted that the Secretary of State  had  not
           advanced a reasoned challenge to Judge Beach's findings at [50].

29. Drawing these factors together, therefore, I approach  my  analysis  on
    the basis that the unchallenged findings of fact reached by the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  are  that  the  appellant  enjoyed  leave   to   remain
    continuously from his arrival in the UK on 16 September 2009  until  28
    November 2018.  On  28  November  2018,  the  appellant's  leave  under
    section 3C of the 1971 Act expired.

30. Against that factual  background,  I  turn  to  Mr  Biggs'  submissions
    concerning the import of Hoque.

31. Pursuant to Hoque, the gap in the appellant's leave from its expiry  on
    28 November 2018 until  25  September  2019  is  known  as  "book-ended
    overstaying": see [9].  Where paragraph  39E  applies  to  "book-ended"
    overstaying, it benefits from the  "disregard"  in  paragraph  276B(v).
    The disregard  concerning  "any  previous  period  of  overstaying"  is
    therefore to be applied as though it  featured  in  paragraph  276B(i),
    which  governs  the  requirement  for  ten  years'  continuous   lawful
    residence.  See [35] per Underhill LJ.

32. Paragraph 39E plainly applies  to  the  appellant's  12  December  2018
    application.  Under rule 39E(2)(b)(ii), an application submitted within
    14 days of the expiry of section 3C leave benefits from the application
    of paragraph 39E.  The appellant's 12 December  2018  application  was,
    following its third variation, ultimately successful.  It was submitted
    within 14 days of the expiry of the appellant's leave under section  3C
    of the 1971 Act.  I find that paragraph 39E applied.   The  appellant's
    overstaying between 28 November 2018 to 25  September  2019  is  to  be
    "disregarded".   It was an error of  law  for  the  judge  to  approach
    matters as she did, although of course it was  entirely  understandable
    that she did so, in light of what was the prevalent view of the law  at
    the time, pursuant to Masum Ahmed.  The  question  then  arises  as  to
    whether the error of law was such that the decision must be set aside.

33. Mr Tufan submitted that, even if the appellant's book-ended overstaying
    was "disregarded", he had not  accrued  ten  years'  lawful  residence.
    Disregarded overstaying does not amount to positive  lawful  residence.
    Merely  being  insulated  from  the  otherwise   adverse   effects   of
    overstaying is not the same as accruing positive lawful residence.

34. My provisional view accorded with Mr Tufan's submissions.  However,  in
    Muneeb Asif (Paragraph 276B - disregard - previous overstaying)  [2021]
    UKUT 0096 (IAC), reported after the hearing in this matter, a different
    constitution of this tribunal held:

         "On the  proper  construction  of  paragraph  276B  any  period  of
         overstaying between periods of leave that has been  disregarded  in
         accordance with sub-paragraph (v)(a) or (b) is  treated  as  lawful
         residence for the purpose of sub-paragraph (i)."

35. As Muneeb Asif was reported after the hearing in the present matter,  I
    provided the parties with the opportunity to respond to this direction:

         "If either party wishes to address the impact, if  any,  of  Muneeb
         Asif (Paragraph 276B - disregard  -  previous  overstaying)  [2021]
         UKUT 96 (IAC) on their submissions in this  matter,  they  must  do
         within 14 days of being sent these directions."

36. Not surprisingly, in his post-hearing submissions, Mr Biggs  relied  on
    Muneeb Asif to underline the submissions he made at  the  hearing.   As
    such, although the appellant  was  without  leave  to  remain  from  28
    November  2018  until  25  September   2019,   such   overstaying   was
    "disregarded" and treated as  lawful  residence,  that  overstaying  is
    treated as lawful residence for the purposes of paragraph 276B.

37. There was no response from the Secretary of State.

38. In light of Muneeb Asif, I consider that  the  appellant's  "bookended"
    overstaying between 28 November 2018 and 25 September  2019  should  be
    treated as lawful residence for the purposes of paragraph 276B.

39. No other issues were raised by the Secretary of State which  undermined
    the appellant's claimed reliance on the  other  criteria  in  paragraph
    276B.  In light of the unchallenged findings of  fact  reached  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I consider  the  appellant  to  have  accrued  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence.   The appellant  enjoyed  leave  to
    remain from 16 September 2009 until 24 April 2012.  In the unchallenged
    findings of fact at [50] of her decision,  set  out  above,  the  judge
    found that the appellant's application on 2 July 2012 was in  time  and
    that the appellant enjoyed section 3C leave at the time.

40. In light of the above analysis, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    involved the making of an error of law such that it must be set  aside.
    I set the decision aside.

41. My provisional view is that this appeal falls  to  be  allowed  on  the
    correct application of paragraph 276B to the  facts  as  found  by  the
    judge.  In these circumstances  I  propose  to  substitute  a  decision
    allowing the appeal without more ado.  Any submissions to the  contrary
    will be taken into account if received within 14 days of the date  this
    decision is sent out.

I propose to substitute a decision allowing the  appeal  without  more  ado.
Any submissions to the contrary will  be  taken  into  account  if  received
