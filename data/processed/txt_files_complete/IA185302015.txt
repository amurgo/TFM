                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  19th  May  1987.  She
       arrived in the UK in September 2011 with entry clearance as a Tier 4
       student migrant, which was extended until 30th September  2013.  The
       appellant then overstayed and on 16th September 2014 applied for  an
       EEA residence card as the wife  of  a  Portuguese  citizen  who  was
       exercising Treaty rights in the UK. This application was refused  on
       22nd April 2015. Her appeal against the decision  was  dismissed  by
       First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  P  Telford  on   all   grounds   in   a
       determination promulgated on the 5th October 2016.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier judge had erred in law by putting the  issue  of
       the paternity of the appellant's child in question in  the  decision
       when this was not raised by the respondent in the  refusal  decision
       and was not put to the appellant as an issue during the hearing.

    3. The matter came before me on 25th April 2017 and I  found  that  the
       First-tier Tribunal had erred in law and set aside the  decision  in
       its entirety. The reasons for my decision can be found at  Annex  A.
       The remaking of the appeal was adjourned with  directions.  Mr  Nath
       pointed out that the  notices  sent  out  for  today's  hearing  had
       indicated that this was a case management review.  However,  it  was
       clear from the directions after the hearing on 25th April 2017  that
       the next hearing would be a remaking one, and neither party objected
       to my concluding the matter substantively today.

Evidence and Submissions - Remaking

    4. The appellant provided evidence in the form  of  a  written  witness
       statement. She also attended  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.  In  her
       written evidence she says, in summary, as follows. She came  to  the
       UK as a student and whilst living here as a student met Mr  Fernando
       Dos Reis  in  November  or  December  2013.  They  met  in  a  local
       restaurant  in  Peckham,  became  friends   and   then   started   a
       relationship. He was living in Oxford at the time that they met.  He
       was also exercising Treaty rights in the UK as  an  EEA  worker.  He
       proposed to her on her birthday in May 2014. They  were  married  in
       September 2014, and she applied for  a  residence  card  as  an  EEA
       spouse in the same month. It  was  only  at  this  point  that  they
       started to cohabit in London. The application for a  residence  card
       was refused and she appealed. She and Mr Fernando  Dos  Reis  had  a
       daughter, [F], born in October 2015. She maintains that the marriage
       is a genuine one, although they have now separated. She maintains Mr
       Dos Reis has provided her with child support for their  daughter  of
       ï¿½100 a month.  She maintains that the fact that her husband does not
       speak fluent English, but is a  Portuguese  speaker  which  lead  to
       problems at the Home Office interview, is not  evidence  that  their
       marriage is one of convenience.  She confirmed in oral evidence that
       she and Mr Dos Reis were not divorced,  and  no  proceedings  for  a
       divorce had been commenced to her knowledge, although he had said on
       occasions he intended to divorce her.

    5. Mr Ukonu presented to the Tribunal evidence that Mr Dos Reis remains
       in employment in the UK in the form of a letter  to  him  from  HMRC
       dated 6th July 2017. He also showed a copy of a letter sending  this
       evidence to the Upper Tribunal in July 2017.  He  confirmed  to  the
       Tribunal orally that he had at the same time sent a copy to the Home
       Office Presenting Officers Unit. Whilst  the  evidence  had  neither
       been attached to the Upper Tribunal file as a result of  being  sent
       in July 2017 nor arrived with the papers that Mr Nath had been given
       I agreed that it should be admitted, and Mr Nath did not object.  Mr
       Nath and I both took time to examine this  evidence.  Mr  Nath  then
       confirmed that the Secretary of State had not  put  in  writing  any
       contention that [F] was not the child of the appellant  and  Mr  Dos
       Reis despite his having asked for written evidence of the  Secretary
       of State's position on this issue  in  accordance  with  the  second
       direction I gave on 25th April 2017. In these circumstances Mr  Nath
       accepted that the position of the respondent  was  that  [F]  was  a
       child of the marriage of the appellant and  Mr  Dos  Reis.  He  also
       accepted that the evidence from HMRC showed Mr Dos  Reis  to  be  in
       employment in the UK in 2017.

    6. The respondent sets out in the reasons for refusal letter dated 22nd
       April 2015 her view that the marriage is one of convenience  because
       there is no evidence of  Mr  Dos  Reis  living  at  the  appellant's
       addresses in London; because all of the photographic evidence of the
       appellant and Mr Dos Reis was from September 2014 bar one photo from
       the day the questionnaire was returned in February 2015; and because
       the appellant and Mr Dos Reis did not request an interpreter for the
       interview, however it was clear that Mr Dos Reis did not  understand
       English sufficiently to be interviewed although a lengthy  interview
       was conducted with the appellant, and so in turn it was unclear  how
       the appellant and Mr Dos Reis communicated.

    7. At the end of the hearing I indicated that I would be  allowing  the
       appeal but that I would set out my reasons in writing.

Conclusions - Remaking

    8. I am satisfied that Mr Ros Reis  is  a  Portuguese  citizen  who  is
       married to the appellant and that he remains in  the  UK  exercising
       Treaty rights as a worker in light of the evidence from  HMRC  dated
       6th July 2017, which in turn shows two on-going employments held  on
       5th April 2017 for him. I  am  satisfied  therefore  that  he  is  a
       qualified person.

    9. The appellant is his family member, as his legal wife, and  entitled
       to a residence card unless  her  marriage  is  one  of  convenience.
       Whilst the lack of documentary  evidence  of  cohabitation  and  the
       problems at  interview  might  have  raised  a  suspicion  that  the
       marriage might have been entered into for the predominant purpose of
       securing residence rights the fact, that it is not challenged by the
       respondent, that there is a child of the marriage I find means  that
       the appellant has provided evidence addressing this  suspicion,  and
       satisfying me that it has not been established that the  appellant's
       marriage is one of convenience when all the evidence is considered.

   10. As such I find that the appellant is entitled to a residence card as
       her husband is a qualified  person  under  Regulation  6(1)  of  the
       Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 and  she  is  his  family  member
       under Regulation 7(1) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016, and
       thus she is entitled to a residence card under Regulation 18 of  the
       Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

       Decision:

    1. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
       making of an error on a point of law.

    2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

    3. I remake the appeal allowing the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

Annex A: Error of Law Decision


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born  on  19th  May  1987.  She
       arrived in the UK in September 2011 with entry clearance as a Tier  4
       student migrant, which was extended until 30th  September  2013.  The
       appellant then overstayed and on 16th September 2014 applied  for  an
       EEA residence card as the  wife  of  a  Portuguese  citizen  who  was
       exercising Treaty rights in the UK. This application was  refused  on
       22nd April 2015. Her appeal against the  decision  was  dismissed  by
       First-tier Tribunal Judge P Telford on all grounds in a determination
       promulgated on the 5th October 2016.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that  it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier judge had erred in law in putting  the  issue  of
       the paternity of the appellant's child in question  in  the  decision
       when this was not raised by the respondent in  the  refusal  decision
       and was not put to the appellant as an issue during the hearing.

    3. The matter  came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law

  Submissions - Error of Law

    4. In the grounds of appeal the appellant argues firstly that the First-
       tier Tribunal erred in law in finding that there was no  evidence  of
       the appellant's spouse's whereabouts at paragraph 7 of  the  decision
       when in fact there was evidence from the appellant (oral and written)
       and her spouse (written). Secondly it is argued that the finding that
       the appellant's child was not  the  child  of  her  spouse  was  also
       irrational and unfair at paragraph 8 of the decision. This was not  a
       point taken by the respondent, and was not put to  the  appellant  in
       the hearing. If this point was to be taken the appellant  would  have
       asked for an adjournment to obtain DNA evidence.

    5. Mr Nath had not been provided with  the  papers  by  the  respondent,
       which I therefore gave him at  the  start  of  the  hearing.  When  I
       explained my  understanding  of  the  case  he  agreed  that  it  was
       appropriate to set aside the decision due to errors of law.

    6. Both parties agreed that the remaking hearing needed to be  adjourned
       as the appellant lacked  evidence  in  supported  of  her  case  with
       respect to her husband exercising Treaty rights in the UK; and it was
       unclear what the  respondent's  position  was  with  respect  of  the
       central  issue  of  whether  the  appellant's  marriage  was  one  of
       convenience given there is a child of the marriage,  evidenced  by  a
       birth certificate  and  born  after  the  date  of  the  respondent's
       decision. Mr Nath had no instructions on this issue.

  Conclusions - Error of Law

    7. It was accurate, and therefore not an error of law,  for  the  First-
       tier Tribunal to find that  there  is  no  evidence  in  the  written
       statements as to why  the  appellant's  spouse  did  not  attend  the
       hearing but was willing to write a statement saying he supported  the
       application because of their daughter [F] born in  October  2015.  It
       was however clear from the statements of the appellant and her spouse
       that they  are  estranged,  and  this  might  provide  some  sort  of
       explanation for his non-appearance.

    8.  The  reasoning  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
       paragraphs 7 and 8 of  the  decision  with  respect  to  finding  the
       marriage is one of convenience is however extremely poor, and I  find
       there is an error of law for failure to give proper reasons  for  the
       decision. It is clear  that  the  appellant  had  conceded  that  her
       marriage was not currently a subsisting relationship, but this is not
       a relevant consideration in EU law in any case; see Diatta v Land  of
       Berlin. The only relevant issues are whether  it  is  a  marriage  of
       convenience or the couple are  divorced.  There  is  no  evidence  or
       finding of a divorce, and I find that in relation  to  the  issue  of
       whether there is a marriage of convenience  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       had to deal with the fact that on face  of  the  papers  before  that
       Tribunal the couple had a child together in October 2015.

    9. I find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in the consideration
       of this material issue by failing  to  consider  the  impact  of  the
       evidence of the birth of this child and  also  by  making  a  factual
       mistake, which was not the fault of the appellant,  when  looking  at
       the issue of the appellant's children as set out below.

   10. The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal apparently became confused about
       the appellant's children. She has two children: the first is the  one
       referred to in response to Question 284 of the interview at paragraph
       8 of the decision. This child is a boy called David  born  in  August
       2013. His father is a Nigerian citizen to whom the appellant was  not
       married. The appellant had a second child, a girl called [F] born  in
       October 2015, who is the child of  the  marriage  to  her  Portuguese
       husband according to the child's birth certificate; the  evidence  of
       the appellant; and the witness statement of her husband. There is  no
       consideration of this child in respect of whether  the  marriage  was
       one of convenience and no clear finding that she is not  a  child  of
       the marriage either, although there is a finding  that  she  has  not
       been registered as a Portuguese citizen.

  Decision:

   11. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
       making of an error on a point of law.

   12. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   13. I adjourn the remaking hearing in accordance with the directions  set
       out below.

  Directions:


    1. The appellant must file with the Upper  Tribunal  and  serve  on  the
       respondent evidence that her husband is exercising Treaty  rights  in
       the UK by the 9th May 2017.

    2. The respondent must confirm in writing to the appellant and the Upper
       Tribunal whether she accepts  the  paternity  of  the  child  [F]  is
       accurately set out on her birth certificate (and thus that she is the
       daughter of Fernando Dos  Reis)  and  whether  the  respondent  still
       contends that the marriage of the appellant and Mr Fernando Dos  Reis
       is one of convenience by 23rd May 2017.

    3. If the respondent does not accept the paternity of [F] is  accurately
       set out on her birth certificate then the appellant must  confirm  in
       writing whether  or  not  she  wishes  to  obtain  DNA  evidence  for
       submission to the Upper Tribunal and the respondent by 30th May 2017.
       If she wishes to obtain such evidence  she  must  attach  a  copy  of
       instructions to a company recognised as accredited for  this  purpose
       by the respondent giving the date  by  which  the  evidence  will  be
       available. At this point she should also let the Upper Tribunal  know
       if a Portuguese  interpreter  is  required  if  she  anticipates  her
       husband will attend to give evidence at the appeal.

    4. The remaking hearing will be listed before me with  consideration  of
       the obtaining of any DNA evidence.
