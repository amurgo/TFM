                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Nigeria born on 6th April 1974.   He
    first arrived in the UK on 21st February 2005 when he was  given  leave
    to enter as a student until 30th September 2006.  He was then  granted
    consecutive leaves to remain in that capacity until 31st May  2008  and
    thereafter as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until  16th April  2012.   On
    17th March 2012 the Appellant applied for further leave to remain again
    as a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant.   That  application  was  refused  on
    10th January 2013 for the reasons given in the Respondent's letter  of
    that date.  The Appellant appealed, and his appeal was heard by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Beach (the Judge) sitting at Taylor House  on  23rd
    April 2013.  He decided to dismiss the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules for the reasons given in his Determination dated 17th  May  2013.
    The Appellant sought leave to appeal that decision, and  on  10th  June
    2013 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The application for leave to remain was refused because  the  Appellant
    failed to score sufficient points under Appendix A: Attributes for  Age
    and Previous Earnings and therefore failed to meet the requirements  of
    paragraph 245CA(c) of the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules
    HC 395 as amended.  This was because  although  it  was  accepted  that
    during the  relevant  period  that  the  Appellant  had  earnings  from
    employment amounting to �27,132.17, his earnings by way of  net  profit
    from a self-employment could not be taken into account as the  evidence
    thereof fell partly outside the relevant period.

 4. The Judge dismissed the appeal because he agreed with that  assessment.
    The period under consideration was  from  1st  March  2011  until  29th
    February 2012 and the documents produced by the  Appellant  as  to  his
    self-employed earnings covered a  longer  period  without  a  breakdown
    showing the  Appellant's  self-employed  earnings  for  the  applicable
    period.

 5. At the hearing, Miss Chinwuba argued that the Judge had erred  in  this
    respect.  In particular, the Appellant had made his application on 17th
    March 2012 and it  therefore  fell  to  be  decided  according  to  the
    provisions of Appendix A applicable at that time.  However,  the  Judge
    had  decided  the  appeal  according  to  the  version  of  Appendix  A
    applicable at the date of the hearing.  There was a material difference
    in paragraph 19 of the two  versions  of  Appendix  A  as  regards  the
    documents which needed to be submitted in support  of  an  application.
    If the Judge had applied the earlier version as he should have done  so
    he would have been able to accept the evidence of the Appellant's self-
    employed earnings which had been submitted with  the  application,  and
    therefore would  have  concluded  that  the  Appellant  had  sufficient
    overall income to score sufficient points under Appendix A:  Attributes
    to satisfy the Immigration Rule.

 6. In response, Mr Tufan agreed that the Judge had decided the  appeal  by
    reference to the wrong version  of  Appendix  A  but  argued  that  the
    difference between the two versions was not material.  This was because
    even when applying the correct earlier version, the documents  provided
    by the Appellant  when  submitting  his  application  would  have  been
    insufficient according to the Policy Guidance applicable  at  the  time
    and the documentary requirements set out in the application form.

 7. I find an error of law in the decision of the Judge so that  it  should
    be set aside.  As argued by Miss Chinwuba the Judge decided the  appeal
    by reference to a subsequent version of Appendix A as opposed  to  that
    in use when the application for leave to remain was made.   This  error
    was material because using the subsequent version of  paragraph  19  of
    Appendix A the documents submitted with the application could not  have
    been  construed  so  as  to  establish  the  Appellant's  self-employed
    earnings as found by the Judge.  However, if the  Judge  had  used  the
    correct version of paragraph 19 of Appendix  A  those  documents  could
    have been so used.  I do not agree with the submission of Mr Tufan.  It
    was established in Pankina v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 719 that  the  Policy
    Guidance was not part of the Immigration Rules and that being the case,
    Mr Tufan's submission that the difference between the two  versions  of
    Appendix A was of no consequence because  of  the  application  of  the
    Policy Guidance has no merit.

Remade Decision

At the hearing, Mr Tufan was helpful enough to concede that had the  correct
version of the Immigration Rules been applied by the  Judge,  the  Appellant
had produced sufficient documentary evidence to show that he had  sufficient
earnings from his employment and his self-employment in order  to  score  75
points under Appendix A: Attributes and thereby  meet  the  requirements  of
paragraph 245CA of HC 295.  I so find.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  find  no
reason to do so.

Upper Tribunal Judge Renton

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In the light of my  decision  to  remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered  whether  to  make  a  fee  award  under  the
provisions of Section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act
2007.  I have had regard  to  the  Joint  Presidential  Guidance  Note:  Fee
Awards in Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a reduced fee award of �70 as I have  now  allowed  the  appeal  upon
evidence which was not before the Respondent when  the  decision  to  refuse
leave to remain was made.
