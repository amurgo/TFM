Team)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of NS, a citizen of Sri  Lanka  born  22  February
       1950, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 1 June  2017
       dismissing her appeal on asylum  and  human  rights  grounds,  itself
       brought  against  the  refusal  of  her  Refugee  and  Human   Rights
       Convention claims on 29 March 2017.


    2. The essence of her asylum claim is set out in the decision below. She
       was born in Trincomalee. She married in 1974. She and her husband had
       a daughter, with whom she now lives in the UK. NS lived in Sri  Lanka
       until 1990, helping the LTTE for some years in the 1980s.


    3. An attack on her home village and her husband's arrest (she  had  not
       seen him since) left her displaced. She began to assist the LTTE with
       their injured, cooking and nursing them, though not providing medical
       care; they then asked her to move her to India with her daughter, and
       she did so.. She remained in a refugee camp until the LTTE found  her
       a house; her daughter entered school there. The  Appellant  continued
       to care for their sick and injured, and they stored  goods  (she  did
       not know what) at her home.


    4. Her daughter was married in 2003, and joined her husband in the UK in
       2008; her son-in-law and her daughter supported her  thereafter.  The
       situation in Sri Lanka seemed to improve thereafter, and she returned
       there, passing through immigration controls at the airport, to manage
       the properties she and her husband had previously owned  together  in
       their home village, living off the rent.


    5. In October 2015, she was informed on to  the  security  forces  by  a
       person called Kugan, who used to work for the LTTE alongside NS.  The
       Appellant was arrested, interrogated as to whether she  had  returned
       to Sri Lanka to help the LTTE regroup, and beaten. Her cousin paid  a
       bribe to secure her release, and subsequently helped her to leave the
       country. She  had  attended  some  demonstrations  in  the  UK  after
       claiming  asylum,  but  had  not  maintained  her   attendance.   The
       Appellant's evidence was supported by  her  daughter,  who  explained
       that she remembered her mother helping the  LTTE  wounded  when  they
       lived in India. Mr DV gave evidence, saying that  the  Appellant  was
       not aware of what the LTTE stored  at  her  house;  it  was  in  fact
       medical supplies. Neither he nor  the  daughter  could  not  remember
       meeting anyone called Kugan, though people had come and gone at their
       home in India.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal generally accepted NS's account of historical
       facts, being impressed by the consistency  and  detail  of  her  oral
       evidence, supported  as  it  was  by  her  daughter.  It  accordingly
       accepted she had provided basic assistance to  the  LTTE  by  way  of
       cooking and caring for their casualties,  which  did  not  extend  to
       membership, or involvement in active battle, intelligence  operations
       or acting as either a courier or informant.


    7. However, the First-tier Tribunal did not accept that she was informed
       on by anyone called Kugan; even had that happened, then it would only
       have been the fact of her low-level involvement that they would  have
       passed on. It accepted that the  authorities  had  treated  her  with
       suspicion, having been established as  a  returnee  from  India:  the
       August 2016 Tamil Separatism Guidance showed this was a  possibility.
       Her release in the circumstances claimed was  inconsistent  with  the
       likely behaviour of the authorities had she been  seen  as  posing  a
       threat to the country's integrity. It cited Underhill LJ in MP [2014]
       EWCA Civ 829 �50, summarising the import of the Country Guidelines in
       GJ:


           "The clear message of the Upper Tribunal's guidance is that a
           record of past LTTE activism does not as such constitute a risk
           factor for Tamils returning to Sri Lanka, because the
           Government's concern is now only with current or future threats
           to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a unitary state; and that that
           is so even if the returnee's past links with the LTTE were of
           the kind characterised by UNHCR as "more elaborate"."


    8. Accordingly, NS did not fall into a category of returnee now at risk.
       Nor would her occasional attendance at demonstrations in the UK place
       her in any danger. Her asylum  claim  therefore  failed.  The  mental
       health difficulties she suffered, the  subject  of  a  report  by  Dr
       Dhumad, were not such as to  raise  a  real  risk  of  an  Article  3
       violation. She was not receiving professional help,  consistent  with
       his  conclusions  that  she  suffered  only  from  mild  to  moderate
       difficulties.


    9. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal had  overlooked
       the acceptance by the Upper Tribunal in  GJ  that  the  fact  bribery
       procured a release from detention was not necessarily  indicative  of
       the seriousness with which a person's case  was  viewed.  Furthermore
       two separate issues were wrongly equated: the authorities'  potential
       view of NS's revivalist activities with the LTTE notwithstanding  her
       true level of involvement, and the reality of her actual involvement.
       It was irrational to find, on the one hand, that NS was detained  and
       tortured  in  late  2015  notwithstanding  her  limited  actual  LTTE
       involvement and  having  regard  to  the  sophisticated  intelligence
       employed by the authorities, and yet on the other hand to  then  rely
       on those very factors to discount the future risk she might face.


   10. Permission to appeal was granted on 17 October 2017 on the basis that
       it was arguable that the Country Guidelines  had  not  been  properly
       applied.


   11. In the Rule 24 response  the  Secretary  of  State  argued  that  the
       decision was consistent with the  Country  Guidelines  decisions  and
       that  proper  consideration  had  been  given  to  the  post-conflict
       evidence of detention.


   12.  Before  me  Mr  Muquit  submitted  that  the  decision  was  plainly
       inconsistent with the recognition in the Country Guidelines  decision
       that post-flight  mistreatment  could  create  relevant  risks  on  a
       return.  Furthermore,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  accepted   the
       evidence of the Appellant's uncle stating that "My uncle told me that
       he is [a] bit afraid to talk to me because the government authorities
       go to his house and question after my mother."


   13. Ms Willock-Briscoe submitted that the evidence regarding the informer
       Kugan was not in fact accepted and that this rejection of one  aspect
       of her case could be read as carrying over to the bribe, so one could
       not extrapolate wholesale acceptance of the Appellant's evidence. She
       was not found to be of interest based on intelligence-based activity.




Findings and reasons


   14. This appeal turns squarely on the legitimacy of the approach taken by
       the  First-tier  Tribunal  when   applying   the   relevant   Country
       Guidelines. The headnote of GJ (post-civil war: returnees) Sri  Lanka
       CG [2013] UKUT 319 (IAC) sets out:


           "(3) The government's present objective  is  to  identify  Tamil
           activists in the diaspora who are working for  Tamil  separatism
           and to destabilise the unitary Sri  Lankan  state  enshrined  in
           Amendment 6(1) to the Sri Lankan  Constitution  in  1983,  which
           prohibits the 'violation of territorial integrity' of Sri Lanka.
            Its focus is on preventing both (a) the resurgence of the  LTTE
           or any similar Tamil separatist organisation and (b) the revival
           of the civil war within Sri Lanka.
           (4) If a person is detained by the Sri Lankan security  services
           there remains a real risk of  ill-treatment  or  harm  requiring
           international protection.
           (5) Internal relocation is not an option within Sri Lanka for  a
           person at real risk from the Sri Lankan authorities,  since  the
           government now controls the whole of Sri Lanka  and  Tamils  are
           required to return to a named address after passing through  the
           airport.  ...
           (7)  The  current  categories  of  persons  at  real   risk   of
           persecution or serious harm on return to Sri Lanka,  whether  in
           detention or otherwise, are: (a)     Individuals who are, or are
           perceived to be, a threat to the integrity of  Sri  Lanka  as  a
           single state because they  are,  or  are  perceived  to  have  a
           significant role in relation to post-conflict  Tamil  separatism
           within the diaspora and/or a renewal of hostilities  within  Sri
           Lanka."


   15. This passage is also relevant given the argument in  the  case,  from
       the body of the judgment at �275: "We take particular account of  his
       view that the seriousness of any charges against  an  individual  are
       not determinative of whether a bribe can be  paid,  and  that  it  is
       possible to leave through the airport even when  a  person  is  being
       actively sought."


   16. The Guidelines in GJ are to the  effect  that  an  individual's  past
       history of mistreatment and detention is relevant in assessing future
       risk only to the extent that such a past shows that the individual is
       perceived by the Sri Lankan authorities as indicating a present  risk
       to the unitary  Sri  Lankan  state  or  the  Sri  Lankan  government.
       Nevertheless, one should not view the categories of returnee at  risk
       as set in stone: Underhill LJ stated in MP (Sri Lanka) 2014] EWCA Civ
       829 at [50]:-


           "...The clear message of the Upper Tribunal's guidance is that a
           record of past LTTE activism does not as such constitute a  risk
           factor  for  Tamils  returning  to  Sri   Lanka,   because   the
           Government's concern is now only with current or future  threats
           to integrity of Sri Lanka as a unitary state; and that  that  is
           so even if the returnee's past links with the LTTE were  of  the
           kind characterised by UNHCR as "more elaborate". I  respectfully
           agree with the Vice-President that that is a conclusion which it
           was entitled to reach.  It  is  also  clear  that  the  Tribunal
           believed that "diaspora activism", actual or perceived,  is  the
           principal basis on which the Government of Sri Lanka  is  likely
           to treat returning Tamils as posing a current or future  threat;
           and I agree that that too was a conclusion which it was entitled
           to reach. But I do not read para. 356(7)(a) of its determination
           as prescribing that diaspora activism as the only basis on which
           a returning Tamil might be regarded as posing such a threat  and
           thus of being at risk on return. Even apart from  cases  falling
           under  heads  (b)-(d)  in  para.  356(7),  there   may,   though
           untypically, be other cases (of which  NT  may  be  an  example)
           where the evidence shows particular grounds for concluding  that
           the Government might regard the applicant as  posing  a  current
           threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state  even  in
           the absence of evidence that he or  she  has  been  involved  in
           diaspora activism."


   17. As shown by MP, where  a  person  has  credibly  asserted  they  have
       suffered  post-conflict  detention  and  mistreatment  amounting   to
       serious harm, then  it  is  perfectly  possible  that,  for  whatever
       reason, they may continue to face a real risk of being  considered  a
       threat to  the  state,  even  though  their  own  profile  would  not
       otherwise have been expected to attract  persecution  when  reviewing
       the case via the categories identified in GJ.


   18. It seems to me that the First-tier Tribunal was  perfectly  aware  of
       the need to carry out a case-specific evaluation  of  the  background
       facts. The kernel of its reasoning is  that  the  evidence  that  the
       Appellant was  informed  upon  is  speculative;  given  the  lack  of
       knowledge of her witnesses as to whether she had ever worked  with  a
       person called Kugan that was an unremarkable  conclusion.  The  judge
       below went on to find that her profile was insufficient to put her at
       risk of persecution given she had not  been  involved  in  separatist
       activities in the modern era, and that the reason she may  have  come
       to attention was much more likely to be  down  to  her  status  as  a
       returnee from India (that  being  a  characteristic  which  objective
       country evidence documented as raising potential suspicion), than for
       any other reason. The conclusion to which the Tribunal came was  that
       this was a deeply unfortunate occurrence:  but  one  that  would  not
       foreseeably recur, as  the  authorities'  suspicions  had  not  borne
       fruit.


   19. I conclude that the assessment of risk below  was  in  fact  a  model
       application of the Country Guidance. The Tribunal was  alive  to  the
       desirability of not treating the risk categories identified in GJ  as
       a procrustean bed. It took account of the fact that the Appellant was
       not of a profile to attract suspicions of separatist sympathies  once
       it was understood that it was likely that the Sri Lankan  authorities
       would apply an intelligence-based approach  to  the  desirability  of
       interrogating her again. Given their interrogation  of  her  did  not
       establish that she presented a risk to the state's  interest  on  the
       last occasion, there was no  reason  to  fear  a  recurrence  of  the
       serious harm she previously faced.


   20. As to the submission that relevant evidence  was  overlooked  showing
       interest in the  Appellant  since  her  departure,  this  has  to  be
       assessed in the context of the fact-finding below. Although  most  of
       the historical facts advanced by the Appellant and her witnesses were
       accepted, there were  reservations:  the  claim  that  she  had  been
       informed against was rejected, and in those circumstances it seems to
       me that one cannot assume that any features of the evidence that  are
       expressly  unmentioned  by  the  judge  below,  and  relate  to   the
       consequences of her detention, were accepted.  Accordingly  I  reject
       the submission that material evidence was overlooked as to the visits
       to her uncle's home by the security forces asserted by one witness.


   21. I accordingly find that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       should stand as it contains no material error of law.

          Decision:

    The appeal is dismissed.

Signed:                                            Date: 25 January 2018
