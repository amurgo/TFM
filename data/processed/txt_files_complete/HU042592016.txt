                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Appellant is a national of Jamaica. She entered the United  Kingdom
    on 21 December 2001, as a visitor, accompanied by  her  daughter.  They
    did not return to Jamaica when their visas expired  and  the  Appellant
    made an unsuccessful application for leave  to  remain  as  a  student,
    which was refused on 14 November 2002. She married an Irish national on
    11 May 2004 but he died on 27 May 2004.

2.   Since January 2005 the Appellant has been in a  relationship  with  her
    current partner, who is a  British  national  and  they  married  on  6
    December 2008. She applied for leave to remain as  his  partner  on  17
    October 2014. This application was refused on 9 January 2015 and she re-
    applied on 29 September 2015.

3.   This application was refused on 2 February 2016. She appealed  and  her
    appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey in  a  decision
    promulgated on 14 September 2017. She applied for permission to  appeal
    but she was refused permission by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Landes  on
    27 March 2018 and Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 3 September 2018.

4.   There was no right of appeal against this decision for the purposes  of
    section 13(8)(c) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007.
    Therefore, she lodged a claim for judicial review of the decision  with
    the Administrative Court. Mrs Justice Lang  granted  permission  on  23
    January 2019 on the  basis  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
    arguably  erred  in  law  when  she  failed  to  consider  the   family
    relationship between the  Appellant  and  her  adult  daughter.  Master
    Gidden quashed the decision by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Grubb  to  refuse
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on 6 March  2019.  The  Vice
    President of the Upper Tribunal then granted  permission  on  30  April
    2019.  The Respondent filed a Rule 24 Reply on 24 May 2019.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING

5.   A skeleton argument had been filed and served by the  Appellant  on  10
    June 2019 and the Respondent had filed and served his skeleton argument
    on 19 June 2019. Neither party had complied with the directions made by
    Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor on 16 May 2019 but no point was taken  on
    this issue  and  the  Tribunal  was  content  to  take  these  skeleton
    arguments into  account.  In  his  oral  submissions  Counsel  for  the
    Appellant relied on grounds 1,2 and 3 of  the  Appellant's  grounds  of
    appeal.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION

6.   Paragraph 17 of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pacey's  decision  indicated
    that the appeal before her proceeded on the  basis  that  refusing  the
    Appellant leave had amounted to a disproportionate breach of Article  8
    of the European Convention on  Human  Rights  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.

7.   She acknowledged in paragraph 30 of her decision that she was bound  to
    take into  account  the  guidance  provided  in  section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. In paragraph  31  of  her
    decision First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey  also  reminded  herself  that
    little weight should be given to a private life or relationship with  a
    qualifying partner when the Appellant  was  here  unlawfully  and  that
    little weight should be given to a private life established at  a  time
    when her leave here was precarious. In paragraph 20 she  also  referred
    to the Appellant's poor immigration history.

8.   In paragraph 19 of her decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pacey  also
    referred to the case of Hesham Ali (Iraq) v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2016] UKSC 60 and the need to determine  the  question
    of proportionality by undertaking  a  balancing  exercise  between  the
    public interest and that of the Appellant. But then she had  failed  to
    take into account evidence relating  to  the  Appellant's  relationship
    with her daughter which should have been weighed into that balance.

9.   In particular, she failed to take into account the  close  relationship
    which the Appellant had with her  adult  daughter,  despite  noting  at
    paragraph 7 of her decision that her daughter and her  son-in-law  were
    living with her. The  Appellant's  daughter  had  stated  in  a  letter
    contained in the Appellant's Bundle that she was still living with  her
    mother, as she could not afford to move out and live on  her  own.  She
    also described her mother as her right hand and said that, whenever she
    needed her mother, she was there. In her witness  statement,  she  also
    stated that she and the Appellant were emotionally  dependent  on  each
    other for support and had not been apart since moving to  the  UK.  The
    chronology also indicates that the Appellant's daughter  was  only  ten
    years old when she entered the United Kingdom with her mother.

10.  The Home Office Presenting Officer submitted that this did  not  amount
    to a material error of law as the Appellant had  not  established  that
    there was a dependency over and above the normal emotional ties between
    members of a family.

11.  However, in paragraph 14 of Kugathas v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2003] EWCA Civ  31,  Sedley  LJ  cited  with  approval  the
    European Commission's observation in S v United Kingdom  (1884)  40  DR
    196 which was that:

         "Generally, the protection of family life under Article 8  involved
         cohabiting dependents, such as parents and their dependents,  minor
         children. Whether it extends to other relationships depends on  the
         circumstances of the particular case. Relationships between adults,
         a mother and her 33 year old son in the  present  case,  would  not
         necessarily acquire the protection of Article 8 of  the  Convention
         without evidence of further elements of dependency, involving  more
         than the normal emotional ties".


12.  In Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 160,  the
    Upper Tribunal also found that:

         "A review of the jurisprudence discloses that there is  no  general
         proposition that Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
         Rights can never be engaged when the family life it  is  sought  to
         establish is between adult siblings living  together.  Rather  than
         applying a blanket rule with regard to adult  children,  each  case
         should be analysed on its own  facts,  to  decide  whether  or  not
         family life exists, within the meaning  of  Article  8(1).   Whilst
         some generalisations are possible, each case is fact-sensitive".


13.  In paragraph 68 the Upper Tribunal also said that on the  facts  before
    them: "We have found that the Appellant depends upon  his  parents  for
    financial, practical and emotional support and guidance. They depend on
    him as their only child still living at home".

14.  It is our view that First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pacey  failed  to  carry
    out the necessary fact-finding exercise and it may  be  that  it  would
    have been open to her, once she  had  done  so,  to  accord  sufficient
    weight to the Appellant's relationship with her daughter, so as to find
    in the Appellant's favour in the necessary balancing exercise. This was
    particularly the case in the context of the length  of  time  that  the
    Appellant has lived in the United Kingdom, the length of  her  marriage
    to a British citizen and the fact that she  had  established  a  deeply
    rooted private life here.

15.  As a consequence, we find that it was an error of  law  for  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pacey not to  consider  the  impact  of  separating  the
    Appellant from her adult daughter.

16.  In the Appellant's third ground of appeal, it was accepted that at  the
    date of the hearing it seemed that the Appellant could  not  show  that
    she met the financial requirements contained  in  Appendix  FM  to  the
    Immigration Rules,  This was a concession that was  in keeping with the
    fact that, at paragraph 14 of her decision, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Pacey recorded that the Appellant's representative submitted  that  she
    could not apply for entry clearance under Appendix FM, as she could not
    meet the financial threshold.

17.  Counsel for the Appellant did not rely on this third ground as  it  was
    originally formulated, which was that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    should have taken into  account  the  fact  that,  as  the  Appellant's
    husband had passed "the Knowledge" in March 2017, he could expect to be
    earning significantly more as a Black Cab driver in  the  future.  This
    would have been a hopeless argument as there was insufficient  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal to  confirm  that  this  was  the  case.
    Therefore, she could not apply Chikwamba v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2008] UKHL 40 with any certainty.

18.  In addition, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  did  not  have  sufficient
    evidence  to  apply  the  Upper  Tribunal's  guidance  in  R  (on   the
    application of Chen) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality)  IJR
    [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) where the Upper Tribunal found:

         "Appendix FM does not include consideration of the question whether
         it would be disproportionate to expect an individual to  return  to
         his home country to make an entry clearance application to  re-join
         family members in the U.K. There may be cases in which there are no
         insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed  outside  the
         U.K. but where temporary separation to enable an individual to make
         an application for entry clearance may be disproportionate. In  all
         cases, it will be for the individual to place before the  Secretary
         of State evidence that such  temporary  separation  will  interfere
         disproportionately with protected rights. It will not be enough  to
         rely solely upon the case-law concerning Chikwamba  v  SSHD  [2008]
         UKHL 40.


19.  At the hearing, the Appellant's evidence went no further  than  stating
    that if she was deported to Jamaica her husband would not  be  able  to
    afford to support two households.

20.  At the  hearing,  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  noted  that  there  was
    evidence  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pacey  to  suggest   the
    Appellant could have met the financial requirements at that time. It is
    the case that his income and expenditure account for the year ending 31
    July 2016 states that her  husband  had  a  net  income  that  year  of
    �13,870. There was also a letter, dated 21 December 2015, which  stated
    that at that date he had an occupational pension of �10.455.96.

21.  However, this was not the basis  of  the  case  put  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pacey, as is clear from the decision and the  record  of
    proceedings. Therefore, this cannot amount to an error of law in First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Pacey's decision.

22.  As a consequence, we find that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pacey  did
    make an error of law in her decision by failing to consider and reach a
    decision in relation to any family life which the Appellant  may  enjoy
    with her adult daughter.

Decision

(1)  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.

(2)  The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey is set aside.

(3)  The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor  House  for
    a de novo hearing before a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Pacey or First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes.
