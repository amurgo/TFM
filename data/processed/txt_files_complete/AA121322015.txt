                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Miss L Irvine, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Handley, dismissing his appeal against refusal of recognition  as
    a refugee from Libya.

 2. The hearing took place on 31 August 2016.  In his determination,  dated
    26 and promulgated on 28 September  2016,  the  judge  applied  AT  and
    Others Libya CG [2014] UKUT 318 (IAC).

 3. FA (Libya: art 15(c)) Libya CG [2016] UKUT 00413 (IAC)  was  published
    on 20 September 2016, headnoted thus:

     1. The question of whether a person is at art 15(c) risk in Libya
        should, until further Country Guidance, be determined on the basis
        of the individual evidence in the case.


     2. This decision replaces AT and Others Libya CG [2014] UKUT 318 (IAC)
        in respect of assessment of the art 15(c) risk.

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal to  the  UT,  on  overlapping
    grounds headed as (1) error on the question of risk of serious harm  in
    Libya (referring to FA and  to  background  evidence);  (2)  irrational
    findings, or failure to take factors into account; (3) failure to  take
    account of factors relevant to the best interests of the child; and (4)
    other failures in relation to article 8 ECHR.

 5. Permission was granted by reference to an arguable error of relying  on
    outdated country guidance.

 6. The timing was unfortunate.  It may be a  counsel  of  perfection  that
    judges should always be aware of up to date country guidance, even if a
    change comes between the hearing and the  decision;  but  that  is  the
    assumption on which error of law must be decided.

 7.  The  respondent  conceded  that  there  has   been   error   of   law.
    Representatives agreed that the appropriate outcome is as follows.

 8. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said on that occasion. The nature of the case is such that  it
    is appropriate in terms of section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act  and  of
    Practice Statement 7.2 to remit the case to the FtT for fresh hearing.

 9. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case or not to  include
    Judge Handley.

10. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
