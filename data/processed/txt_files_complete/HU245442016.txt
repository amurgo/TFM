                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Woolf promulgated on the  9th  April  2018  whereby  the
    judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse the appellant's claims based on Article 8  of  the
    ECHR.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

 3. Leave to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Chapman on 12th November 2018. Thus  the  case  appeared
    before me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law
    in the decision.

    Immigration background

 4. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 11 October 2009 with  leave
    valid as a student until 30 April 2013. The appellant was then  granted
    further leave under Tier 1 Post-study  Work  Migrant  until  28  August
    2014.

 5. I note at B3 and again in B7 in the submissions made by the appellant's
    representatives that there is reference to the fact that the  appellant
    went to settle down in Pakistan in 2013-2014 but had  problems  finding
    employment. It stated that (B8) when he visited Pakistan for 6 weeks in
    2014 he suffered liver damage and had to be hospitalised on his  return
    to the UK. It is material that the appellant determined  thereafter  to
    return to the United Kingdom, having been in Pakistan with  a  view  to
    settling in his country of origin.

 6. On 26 August 2014 the appellant made an application as the  partner  of
    an EEA national. That application was  refused.  The  appellant  on  25
    September 2014 made an application on the basis of private life,  which
    was also refused.

 7. Clearly by that stage the appellant no longer had any leave  to  be  in
    the United Kingdom. The appellant thereafter has remained in the United
    Kingdom.

 8. At the date of the present application  the  appellant,  a  34-year-old
    man, had been in the United Kingdom for 6 years. The appellant does not
    appear to be pursuing application on the basis of family  life  but  is
    seeking to pursue rights on private life grounds based in the main upon
    his medical conditions.

 9. In considering the appellant's application  the  respondent  considered
    whether  the  appellant   qualified   under   the   Immigration   Rules
    specifically paragraph 276 ADE (vi). The issue was whether or not there
    were very significant obstacles to his integration into the country  to
    which he would have to go if he were to leave the United  Kingdom.  The
    appellant did not fall for consideration under any of the other of  the
    provisions of the rules.

10. Otherwise consideration was  given  to  the  appellant's  rights  under
    Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

11. In essence the appellant was seeking to rely upon medical conditions as
    constituting either very significant obstacles to his integration  into
    his country of origin or exceptional circumstances warranting  a  grant
    of leave to remain outside the rules.

12. The appellant has indicated  that  he  suffers  from  type  I  diabetes
    mellitus, hypertension, depressive  disorder  and  anxiety,  liver  and
    kidney disease, back, neck and leg pain following  a  car  accident  in
    2010. In the car accident in 2010 the appellant had had bone  fractures
    which had required surgery. The appellant is seeking to rely  upon  his
    medical conditions  including  his  mental  health  condition  includes
    potential suicidal ideation.

13. There is in the documentation submitted  a  list  medication  that  the
    appellant was taking at the time of the application itself. [see B4] It
    is suggested that the cost on a monthly basis  for  the  medication  in
    Pakistan would be 16,440 Pakistan rupees per month. No  indication  has
    been made as to how that calculation is arrived at.

14. According to the decision the evidence with regard to  the  appellant's
    mental health conditions was contained in reports dated 18 August  2015
    and an NHS report dated 23 September 2016. In the original report of 18
    August 2015 it was the appellant's own report that  he  had  taken  too
    much insulin a number of months prior to seeing the doctor. He  claimed
    that he done it deliberately as he thought that his life was not  worth
    living.

15. However the most recent report from the NHS Hounslow dated 23 September
    2016 whilst confirming that the appellant suffered from depression  did
    not indicate that he was suffering from any suicidal ideation.

16. It has to be noted that  the  appellant  himself  did  not  attend  the
    hearing as it was suggested he was unfit and his sister did attend  the
    hearing. It is suggested in the  skeleton  argument  submitted  by  the
    appellant's representative before me that her evidence was critical  in
    that it stated that the appellant needed an insulin pump and such pumps
    were not available in Pakistan.

17. The problem with regard to the evidence is that it is coming  from  the
    appellant's sister not from a medical source. Whilst clearly an insulin
    pump may be the best means by which the medication can be  administered
    to the appellant there is  nothing  to  suggest  that  other  means  of
    administering the medication, such as by the appellant  himself,  would
    not work equally as well provided the  appellant  followed  the  proper
    dosage. The appellant's sister is not an expert in that respect.

18. The grounds of appeal themselves merely asserted that the appellant had
    been in error in relying upon his sister to attend the hearing and give
    evidence on his behalf. The appellant  accepted  that  he  should  have
    attended to hearing himself.

19. The grounds continue by  asserting  that  his  case  should  have  been
    allowed under article 3 and article 8  on  the  basis  of  his  medical
    condition and that the appeal should also be considered  under  article
    2. The appellant raises the prospect that his return to Pakistan  could
    engage aspects of torture, which he asserts can come in many forms.

20. At the hearing before me the  appellant's  representative  submitted  a
    skeleton argument and a bundle of documents that he was seeking to rely
    upon. No issue was taken by the respondent's  representative  with  the
    skeleton argument but it was pointed out that the documents and some of
    the submissions being made were not in evidence before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.

21. The first point made in the skeleton argument was that the judge should
    have adjourned the case so as to enable the  appellant  to  attend  and
    give direct evidence as to his condition. Thereafter reliance is placed
    upon a statement submitted by  the  appellant  post  the  date  of  the
    decision by the judge which sets out  the  circumstances  in  which  he
    currently lives and the help, which he receives from his sister.

22. The respondent's representative  made  the  point  that  there  was  no
    application for an adjournment and the appellant had  conceded  in  the
    grounds, which he had lodged, that he  had  chosen  to  rely  upon  his
    sister to make submissions and give evidence on his behalf.

23. Whilst I appreciate that the appellant was unrepresented, it is not for
    a judge of his own  motion  to  determine  to  adjourn  the  case.  The
    appellant  had  had  considerable  time  to  submit  documentation  and
    evidence in support of his case. He had had  legal  representatives  in
    the past, who had made submissions with the original  application.  The
    appellant has not  suggested  that  on  the  day  in  question  he  was
    incapable attending the hearing but rather suggested that he  is  wrong
    to have relied upon his sister to have attended on his behalf. That was
    a matter of choice by him. If he was seeking  to  assert  that  he  was
    unfit to attend the hearing he would have needed  medical  evidence  to
    substantiate  such.  On  the  basis  of  such  medical   evidence   and
    application to adjourn could have been made.

24.  There was no application to adjourn. In the  circumstances  the  judge
    was perfectly entitled to proceed with the hearing and to consider  the
    appeal on the basis of the evidence lodged.

25. Thereafter as stated the skeleton argument sets out  the  circumstances
    in which the appellant is living in the United Kingdom. In  considering
    the circumstances in which the appellant  came  to  be  in  the  United
    Kingdom and in which he was living the judge had clearly considered the
    evidence that was before him and was entitled to make findings that  he
    did.

26. The skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant seeks to rely upon the
    statement in which the appellant states that the insulin pump  that  he
    has is priced at between �4 and �25 a day, which when set  against  the
    average pay in Pakistan of �1.50 per day would mean that the  appellant
    would not be able to have an insulin pump in Pakistan. The problem with
    regard to the evidence is that it would need medical or expert evidence
    to substantiate much of what the  appellant  was  saying.  The  medical
    evidence  would  have  to  deal  with  whether  there  were   available
    alternative means of administering  the  insulin  which  the  appellant
    requires and the effectiveness of such alternative  treatments.  Merely
    because the appellant in the United  Kingdom  has  the  benefit  of  an
    insulin pump as the best form of treatment  available,  does  not  mean
    that other forms  of  treatment  would  not  be  equally  as  effective
    provided the appellant applied the appropriate dosage. [see the case of
    AM (Zimbabwe) 2018 EWCA Civ 64 referred to below specifically the facts
    in respect of the 2nd appellant in that  decision,  who  was  suffering
    from forms of cancer]

27. Within the submissions reliance is then placed upon the consequences to
    the appellant of not receiving his  insulin.  It  is  argued  that  the
    appellant may  over  a  period  of  time  lose  limbs  or  suffer  from
    retinopathy. Such symptoms are not uncommon  in  individuals  that  are
    suffering from diabetes and require insulin to support them on a  daily
    basis. Indeed even in the United Kingdom individuals that  suffer  from
    diabetes have to carefully monitor the sugar  levels,  insulin  levels,
    problems with hypoglycaemia and a number of other factors and can still
    suffer loss of limbs and retinopathy.

28. Whilst reference has been made to the risks that  face  the  appellant,
    they are risks that face all the individuals that suffer from diabetes.



29. The appellant's representative has raised issues  with  regard  to  the
    appellant's physical and mental health. The argument deals firstly with
    D  v  UK  identifying  a  number  of  factors  which  may  engage  very
    exceptional circumstances, namely a) that the applicant  is  critically
    ill, b) appear to be close to death, c) could not be guaranteed nursing
    or medical care in his country of origin and d) had no  family  in  his
    country of origin willing to or able to care for  him  or  provide  for
    him.

30. It  was  submitted  that  other  cases  extend  the  principles.  In  D
    compelling humanitarian considerations weighed against the  applicant's
    expulsion.

31. Paragraph 183 from AM (Zimbabwe) [2018] EWCA Civ  64  is  relied  upon.
    Therein it was ruled:-

         "183     The court  considers  that  the  'other  very  exceptional
         cases' within the meaning of the judgement in N v UK  ,  which  may
         raise an issue under Article 3 should be  understood  to  refer  to
         situations involving the removal of a seriously ill person in which
         substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he  or  she,
         although not at imminent risk of dying, would face a real risk,  on
         account of the absence of appropriate treatment  in  the  receiving
         country or the lack of access to such treatment, are being  exposed
         to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or her state of
         health resulting in intense suffering or to a significant reduction
         in life expectancy. The Court  points  out  that  these  situations
         correspond to a high threshold for the application of Article 3  of
         the convention in cases concerning the removal of aliens  suffering
         from serious illness."


32. Thereafter having dealt with the physical problems that might face  the
    appellant issues are raised with regard to the mental health aspect and
    J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ  629  were  factors  are  emphasised  that  in
    removing an individual the state has effective mechanisms to reduce the
    risk of suicide. If there are effective mechanisms that also will weigh
    heavily against an applicant's claim that removal will violate  his  or
    her article 3 life rights.

33. The appellant has sought to rely upon the none availability of specific
    forms of Insulin pumps in Pakistan. That is not to say that  that  type
    of treatment is the only  type  that  can  deal  with  the  appellant's
    condition.

34. I note also that the  appellants  have  sought  to  raise  the  various
    medical conditions as a basis for seeking to be able to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom. I have considered the issues  arising  because  of  the
    medical condition. The case law clearly identifies that medical  issues
    may be considered both under Article 3 and Article 8.  Insofar  as  the
    appellant has raised medical issues the cases of N [2005] UKHL 31 and D
    v UK [1997] 24ERR 425 are the principal case law basis for  considering
    medical conditions. The cases concentrate on the imminence of death and
    palliative care available in  the  recipient  state  as  an  individual
    approaches death.

35. I note the approach taken in the case of GS India [2015] EWCA  Civ  40.
    The European Court of Human Rights has set down  a  slightly  different
    test in the case of Paposhvili  v  Belgium  13th  December  2016  ECtHR
    (Application no 41738/10).

36. The case  of  EA  &  ors  (Article  3  medical  cases-  Paposhvili  not
    applicable)  [2017]  UKUT  445  indicated  that  given  the   line   of
    authorities in the United Kingdom the approach advocated in  Paposhvili
    was not to be followed.   In  paragraph  67  of  the  judgment  is  the
    following:-

         "67 This result is all of the piece with the repeated statements in
         the Strasbourg court that 'aliens  who  are  subject  to  expulsion
         cannot  in  principle  claim  any  entitlement  to  remain  in  the
         territory of a contracting state in order to  continue  to  benefit
         from medical, social or other  forms  of  assistance  and  services
         provided by the expelling state"


37. The exceptions set down in the cases of N and D  and  such  exceptional
    cases by reason of the factors therein set out may result in a grant of
    leave. In order to succeed on  the  basis  of  medical  conditions  and
    either Article 3 or Article 8 one  has  to  bring  oneself  within  the
    exceptions indicated.

38. To assist in applying the principles guidance has  been  given  in  the
    case of AM & others v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 64. In paragraph 19  of  the
    judgment reference is made to the test set down in N v SSHD in which it
    is emphasised that in respect of aliens  cannot  claim  entitlement  to
    remain to benefit from medical treatment. It  is  only  in  exceptional
    cases where the humanitarian grounds  against  removal  are  compelling
    that Article 3 would be engaged. On the facts referred to in  the  case
    Mr Nowar was suffering from cancer and it was accepted  that  he  would
    not receive the same cutting-edge treatment on return to Jordan. AM was
    suffering from HIV+ and again whilst the treatment may not be the  most
    up to date the condition would receive treatment on return to Zimbabwe.
     In  setting  guidance  paragraph  38  of  the  judgment  contains  the
    following:-

         "38      So far as the ECtHR and the Convention are concerned,  the
         protection  of  Article  3  against  rem  paragraph  continues   by
         identifying that the boundary has been shifted not oval in  medical
         cases is not now confined to deathbed cases where death is  already
         imminent when the applicant is in the removing country. It  extends
         to cases where "substantial grounds have been shown  for  believing
         that the applicant, although not at imminent risk of  dying,  would
         face a  real  risk,  on  account  of  the  absence  of  appropriate
         treatment  in  the  receiving  country  lack  of  access  to   such
         treatment, of being exposed to a serious,  rapid  and  irreversible
         decline in  his  or  her  state  of  health  resulting  in  intense
         suffering to a significant reduction in life expectancy."


39. The paragraph continues by  identifying  that  the  boundary  has  been
    shifted from being defined by the imminence of death to  being  defined
    by an imminence of intense suffering or death in  the  receiving  state
    which may occur only because of the non-availability in that  state  of
    appropriate treatment. That interpretation is emphasised  in  paragraph
    40 of the judgement where it requires a serious and  rapid  decline  in
    health resulting in intense suffering for the Article 3 standard to  be
    engaged.

40. The judge in paragraph 35 of his  judgement  has  identified  that  the
    evidence fell short of establishing that the physical ill-health of the
    appellant had reached such a critical stage that article 3 was engaged.
    The evidence did not show that the appellant was dying and it  had  not
    demonstrated that medical or other services necessary to  preserve  his
    life were not available in Pakistan. Whilst the evidence did show  that
    the specific pumps that the appellant  used  were  not  available,  the
    judge concluded that the evidence did not  show  that  other  ancillary
    treatments were not available in  Pakistan  both  with  regard  to  his
    diabetes and conditions flowing therefrom.

41. The judge has gone on to consider the mental health  condition  of  the
    appellant and whether or not letting gauges the criteria set down.  The
    judge was satisfied that the respondent would take necessary  steps  to
    obviate any risk appellant would harm himself and  in  any  event  that
    there was no indication that there was an immediate risk  of  self-harm
    or suicide.

42. The judge went on to consider specifically article 8 whether article  8
    was engaged on the facts as presented. The  judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant had family members back in Pakistan that could assist him. He
    noted otherwise other family members who may  be  able  to  assist  the
    appellant and was satisfied on the basis of the  combine  resources  of
    the family members being sufficient to provide for the appellant.

43. The judge concluded that the circumstances were not such as  to  breach
    either the article 3 or article 8 rights of the  appellant.  Given  the
    careful analysis of the facts as presented to the judge, the judge  was
    entitled to come to the conclusions that he did.

44. In the circumstances there is no material error of law.  I  uphold  the
    decision to dismiss this appeal
