Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr S Karim, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr A Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are  citizens  of  Bangladesh.   The  second  and  third
    Appellants are the  dependants  of  the  first  Appellant.   The  fifth
    Appellant is a dependant of the fourth Appellant.  The  appeals  depend
    on the claims brought by the first and fourth Appellants.  They  sought
    to show that on the balance of probabilities  they  were  entrepreneurs
    within the meaning of the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant Scheme set  out
    within  paragraph  245D  of  the  Immigration  Rules  with   particular
    reference to paragraph 245DD.  The Appellants' application was  refused
    by the Secretary of State on 15th July 2015.  The  Appellants  appealed
    and the appeal came before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pears
    sitting at Harmondsworth on 14th July 2016.  In a decision and  reasons
    promulgated on 22nd July 2016 the Appellants' appeals were dismissed.

 2. The Appellants lodged Grounds of Appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  2nd
    August 2016.  On 17th November 2016 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Baker granted permission to appeal.  Judge Baker considered that  there
    were merits within the grounds that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had
    at paragraph 24 when stating that  he  was  not  convinced  created  an
    arguable error in imposing too high  a  standard  of  proof.   Further,
    Judge Baker considered that the decision was arguably unsustainable for
    lack of reasons in the findings contained at paragraphs 30 to 35 of the
    decision and  that  there  was  merit  in  the  ground  the  judge  had
    materially erred in  not  giving  consideration  in  the  findings  and
    reasons to the explanations he had recorded as given by the  Appellants
    for matters raised against them by the Respondent.

 3. The Secretary of State provided a Rule 24  response  on  30th  November
    2016 contending that the judge had considered all the evidence and made
    findings that were open to him.

 4. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there are material errors of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The Appellants appear by  their  instructed
    Counsel, Mr Karim.  The Secretary of State appears by her  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, Mr Melvin.

Submission/Discussion

 5. I indicated in my initial remarks that I identified  from  the  way  in
    which the Grounds of Appeal were pleaded and addressed by  Judge  Baker
    when granting permission that there were effectively three limbs to the
    Grounds of Appeal:

      i) That the judge had imposed too high a standard of proof.

     ii) That there was a lack of reasoned findings.

    iii) That explanations fully recorded elsewhere in the decision did  not
         appear to be addressed in the findings or reasons.

    Mr Karim starts by agreeing with that analysis of the grounds and seeks
    to take me to them one  by  one.   He  notes  that  the  judge  was  at
    paragraph 30 of his decision not convinced on hearing the evidence that
    there was a viable business plan.  Mr Karim points out that it was  not
    necessary for the judge to be "convinced" but that the decision  should
    be based on the balance of probabilities.  Secondly, he takes  bits  of
    the findings and conclusions to be found at paragraph 29 onwards in the
    decision.  He notes that at paragraph 30 the judge had stated that when
    he read the papers he was unclear what the business consultancy had  to
    offer small and medium sized businesses.  He submits that  this  is  an
    irrational conclusion bearing in mind that the judge had the benefit of
    the business plan that was before him and that the business plan  which
    is to be found at page 70 and beyond of the Appellants'  bundle  before
    the First-tier Tribunal set out in detail what their work was to be and
    at paragraph 2 under "services" within that  plan  identified  specific
    areas  including  family   business   advisory   services,   management
    consultants, project planning, project monitoring, etc.

 6. He considered that the finding at paragraph 31 in the judge's  decision
    that "the business plan was unrealistic at conception and proved to  be
    shortly thereafter" was a bare assertion and that had  the  judge  been
    going to reach such a finding then it was incumbent upon  him  to  give
    reasons.  He takes me to the authority of MK  (duty  to  give  reasons)
    Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC) where the President  of  the  Tribunal
    indicated that it was axiomatic that the determination discloses  clear
    reasons for a Tribunal's findings and that if  a  Tribunal  finds  oral
    evidence to be implausible, incredible or unreliable or a  document  to
    be worth no weight whatsoever, it  was  necessary  to  say  so  in  the
    determination and for such findings to be supported by reasons.  A bare
    statement that a witness was  not  believed  or  that  a  document  was
    afforded no weight was unlikely to  satisfy  the  requirement  to  give
    reasons.  Mr Karim submits that that basic premise has not been applied
    in this instant case by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

 7. He comments that the status of the  Appellants  is  best  described  as
    being precarious in that they were uncertain that they would be granted
    visas and that was the reason why there had been a lack  of  investment
    at the time of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  the
    proposed business and that this was a  factor  the  judge  should  have
    taken into account.

 8. He notes the finding of the judge  at  paragraph  32  namely  that  the
    Appellants had not satisfactorily explained the  source  of  funds  and
    states that it was known to the judge that the Appellants  had  savings
    and that the judge has failed to give reasons why the evidence  of  the
    Appellants was not credible or acceptable.  He notes  that  this  is  a
    points-based appeal and that therefore new evidence would be  excluded.
    He  indicates  that  despite  this  the  judge  has  gone  on  to  make
    speculative findings at paragraph 33 without considering in  detail  or
    properly or sufficiently the evidence that was in front of him and that
    it was, he  contends,  accepted  that  there  was  consistency  in  the
    evidence that was being produced.  It is his contention that  there  is
    no properly reasoned credibility finding and  certainly  not  one  that
    would meet the criteria set out within MK.  He asked me on  that  basis
    to find that there are material errors of law within  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge and to set  aside  the  decision  and  to
    remit it to the First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing.

 9. Mr Melvin's starting point is to rely on  the  Rule  24  response.   He
    indicates  that  the  judge  has  assessed  the   evidence   thoroughly
    throughout the decision and that he  has  given  consideration  to  the
    witness statements of the Appellants and has  given  a  prï¿½cis  of  his
    findings within paragraphs 30 to 35.  He challenges the suggestion made
    by Mr Karim that there is any suggestion that the  judge  has  elevated
    the balance of probabilities standard to a  higher  standard  i.e.  one
    that would be required within criminal cases and  that  the  judge  has
    clearly assessed the evidence and  found  a  lack  of  credibility  and
    genuine evidence and hence reached conclusions thereon.

10. He states that the judge has given full consideration to the Notice  of
    Refusal, has looked at the viability of the  business,  considered  the
    evidence  regarding  funds,  advertising,  etc.  and  made  conclusions
    thereof.  He points out that at paragraph 17 the judge  has  given  due
    consideration to the documentary evidence and has been  concerned  with
    the knowledge of what could be offered to potential clients.

11. In response to Mr Karim he submits that Section 85(a) does not  prevent
    an Appellants from showing clear evidence that their businesses are  an
    ongoing concern.  He would argue that  the  judge  has  looked  at  the
    evidence within the body of the determination and it  is  necessary  to
    look at the findings  and  what  the  business  account  show.   He  is
    concerned at paragraph 21 with regard to the solicitor's fees  and  the
    Appellants chose not to rebut that evidence  and  were  concerned  with
    what they could offer as consultants.  He emphasises  at  paragraph  23
    the judge has looked at the business plan and made  findings  and  that
    the  projection  set  out  in  the  proposed  business  plan  have  not
    materialised and therefore the judge was entitled to reach a conclusion
    that the business has not got a solid  basis.   He  contends  that  all
    evidence has  been  thoroughly  considered  and  that  the  conclusions
    reached are based on factual findings in the determination which,  when
    read holistically, addressed the concerns of  the  Respondent  and  the
    rebuttal or lack of rebuttal evidence that is put forward and that  the
    findings made were ones that were open to the judge.

12. He states there was no reason why the Appellants could not have pursued
    business premises bearing in mind that they  have  put  in  Section  3C
    leave and that any judge considering the evidence was entitled to  find
    that this was not a genuine  and  viable  business.    He  specifically
    refers me to the authority again of the President of Arshad and  Others
    (Tier 1 applicants - funding - "availability") [2016]  UKUT  334  (IAC)
    and to the comments made therein at paragraph 45.

13. Mr Karim comes back on the lack of rebuttal which is raised within  the
    Notice of Refusal and submits that the issues found at paragraphs 30 to
    32 are not ones that were found within the Notice of Refusal  and  that
    it is difficult for a witness statement to say a business is doing well
    but that it is necessary for the Tribunal to give consideration to  the
    witness statement evidence and that paragraphs 12 to 17  of  the  first
    Appellant's witness statement makes it clear as to the intention of the
    proposed business and the determination of the  Appellants  to  succeed
    within this type of business.  He submits that it is actually not  open
    to an Appellant to do more than that.  So far as the issue of  business
    premises is concerned he submits it is necessary to make a  distinction
    between business premises and the registered office and that that is an
    important factor to be taken into account.

14. He takes the view that  at  paragraph  25  the  judge  notes  that  the
    Appellant has blamed the lack of business development on the absence of
    a visa and that he has consequently made a decision as to  why  nothing
    substantial has been done whereas there was in fact a valid reason  for
    that.

15. Finally, in brief response again Mr Melvin takes me to paragraph 88  of
    the judgment pointing out that  the  applications  were  considered  in
    great detail in the Notice  of  Refusal  and  the  individual  concerns
    therein were  expressed  and  the  Secretary  of  State  addressed  the
    credibility and viability of the business itself noting that funds were
    clearly in issue as were the lack of contract and the  services  to  be
    provided.  It is his contention that the judge had looked at all issues
    in the Notice of Refusal and he  maintains  the  Secretary  of  State's
    position and that the decision discloses no material errors of law  and
    he asked me to dismiss the appeal.

The Law

16.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

17. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

18. Earlier in this decision I have set out the issues that were raised  in
    the Grounds of Appeal.  Much of the submission and concern  relates  to
    the brevity given in the findings and conclusions and  the  submissions
    made by Mr Karim that those findings  are  not  supported  by  evidence
    based conclusions from the judge.  I do not agree with that submission.
     It is  important  I  give  reasons.   It  has  been  made  very  clear
    throughout and as a main part of his submission by Mr Melvin that it is
    necessary to look at the body of the decision and it is clear when that
    is done that this is a judge who  has  gone  through  the  evidence  on
    almost a line by line basis and has looked at the facts of the case  in
    reaching his conclusions.  He has gone through at paragraphs 11 and  12
    the Notice of Refusal and the findings therein.  It is clear  therefore
    that the judge has throughout this decision addressed  the  basis  upon
    which the Secretary of State refused the decision.  He  has  noted  the
    reference to the first and fourth Appellants being business consultants
    and has gone on to consider not only  their  business  development  and
    experience but has made findings at paragraph 16  with  regard  to  the
    development of the business and the lack of contracts.  It may be  that
    it would have been better if such findings had been  found  within  the
    conclusions section but it is clear that those findings  are  made  and
    that they are ones that the judge was entitled to reach and importantly
    that he has given his reasons for them.

19.  Thereinafter  at  paragraph  17  the  judge  has  gone  on   to   give
    considerations to the investment of ï¿½50,000 and has made a finding that
    apart from that assertion as to where the money came from that  is  not
    shown on the basis of the documentary evidence.  It is clear  that  the
    judge has considered the documentary evidence  in  this  case  in  very
    considerable detail and has made findings and conclusions thereon  that
    he was entitled to.

20. Reference is further made within paragraphs 19 and 20 to the employment
    previously of the third and fourth Appellants and to the current Lloyds
    bank account to be found at page 44  of  the  Appellants'  bundle.   Mr
    Melvin points out that the judge noted that as at  28th  February  2014
    that account had a balance of ï¿½30 and  that  there  was  not  a  single
    document showing the source of  that  deposit.   Such  finding  is  not
    challenged and was  one  that  the  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude.
    Further, at paragraph 21 he has gone on to consider the  issue  of  the
    solicitor's fees and made findings thereon and at  paragraph  22  noted
    the position that there has only ever been one contract entered into.

21. Thereinafter at paragraph 23 the judge has analysed the  business  plan
    and considered the contribution of funds at paragraph 24 and  the  fact
    that there was only  one  valid  contract  at  paragraph  25.   He  has
    considered the witness statement evidence and  then  gone  on  to  make
    findings at paragraph 29 and thereafter.

22. I have recited the above in some detail because that shows clearly  the
    approach adopted by the judge which leads to  his  short  findings  and
    conclusions within paragraphs 29 to 36.  It is inappropriate and indeed
    plainly wrong to just consider those latter paragraphs in isolation.

23. Having considered all these factors I am satisfied that the  judge  has
    firstly not considered too high a burden of proof.   The  fact  remains
    that the judge was not convinced  of  the  business  plan  and  of  the
    business's viability.  That was a finding that he was entitled to  make
    on a balance of probabilities.  There is nowhere  within  the  decision
    any suggestion or means of construction that he has imposed too high  a
    standard.  Secondly, the contention that  he  has  not  given  reasoned
    findings is plainly wrong.  He  has  given  a  considerable  number  of
    reasons albeit that they are predominately to be found within the  body
    of the decision rather than within the brief conclusions reached at the
    end of the decision.  Thirdly,  even  if  explanations  fully  recorded
    elsewhere are not recited within the findings or reasons providing they
    are addressed, which they clearly are, does  not  in  itself  create  a
    material error of law.  It may well be that had the judge set  out  his
    decision in a different way that it might read better but it is not  an
    error of law to set out a judge's findings in the manner in which  this
    particular judge has done.  What he has done  is  to  analyse  all  the
    relevant factors of this matter and based  on  the  evidence  that  was
    before him to come to conclusions that he was  entitled  to.   In  such
    circumstances whilst acknowledging it  will  be  disappointing  to  the
    Appellants based on the evidence that was before  him  I  am  satisfied
    that the judge made findings that he was entitled to make and that  the
    decision  discloses  no  material  error  of  law  and  the  appeal  is
    consequently dismissed and the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge is maintained.
