                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the  refusal  of
    further leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

 2. The appellant made her application on 19 October  2012.   On  26  March
    2013  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for  refusing  her
    application, and for making a concomitant decision to remove  her  from
    the United Kingdom by  way  of  directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  She  claimed  30  points
    under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  But for  applications  made
    on or after 22 February 2010 it became mandatory that applications as a
    Tier 4 Student Migrant were accompanied by a Confirmation of Acceptance
    for Studies (CAS).  She had provided no evidence to establish that  she
    had been assigned a CAS and no valid CAS had been found.

The Hearing Before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Wyman sitting at Hatton  Cross
    on  17  July  2013.   Both  parties  were  legally   represented.   The
    appellant's case was that she had been a  victim  of  unfairness.   The
    Secretary  of  State  failed  to  take   into   account   her   special
    circumstances.  The  college  where  she  was  studying,  City  Banking
    College, had been involved in litigation with UKBA.  In July  2012  the
    college obtained an interim relief in the High Court allowing  them  to
    continue to educate students up  to  23  November  2012.   The  college
    informed the Treasury Solicitors that of  the  150  students  who  were
    allowed to continue and finish their studies, nine students  (including
    the appellant) would need to have their leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom extended in order to complete the BSc programme.   The  college
    requested that nine CAS's be issued to  support  these  nine  students,
    including the appellant.  The Treasury Solicitors  did  not  accede  to
    this request.

 4. In his subsequent findings, Judge Wyman said the appellant had  been  a
    very good student throughout the time  she  had  been  present  in  the
    United Kingdom.  She had previously been awarded an advanced diploma in
    management practice with distinction, and had now been awarded a degree
    from University of Roehampton with first class honours.  The key  issue
    was whether or not the appellant could comply with the Rules.   It  was
    not in dispute the  appellant  had  not  submitted  a  valid  CAS  when
    applying for further leave to remain on 18 October 2012.

 5. The judge went on to refer to the  Tier  4  sponsor  guidance  on  what
    happens if a college becomes a legacy sponsor.  The CAS  allocation  is
    set to zero.  They are not allowed to sponsor any new students but  can
    continue to sponsor students already studying until they  finish  their
    course.  The guidance goes on say that if any of the existing  students
    need to extend their leave so they can complete the course,  they  will
    be able to apply for a CAS to be assigned to them.

 6. The judge continued:

         In this case, the appellant does not need to extend  her  leave  so
         that she can complete her course as this was already granted.  What
         the appellant is asking for is something different  -  for  further
         leave to remain to start a new course at a different  college  (the
         University of Sunderland).


 7. The judge  therefore  concluded  that  she  did  not  fall  within  the
    circumstances set out in the Tier 4 sponsor guidance, and  he  said  he
    had not option but to dismiss the appeal.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 8. Miss Nabila Mallick of Counsel settled the grounds  of  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  She argued that the judge had erred in law in  failing
    to consider whether the decision itself was not in accordance with  the
    law.  She said the judge had wrongly focused on  the  circumstances  as
    they existed at the date of the hearing i.e. that the appellant had now
    completed the course for which she had been seeking  further  leave  to
    complete.

The Grant of Permission

 9. On 6 September 2013 Designated Judge Macdonald  granted  permission  to
    appeal, holding that while the judge noted the key issue was whether or
    not the appellant could comply with the  Rules,  it  was  arguable  the
    judge had not looked at the issue of fairness to the appellant in  line
    with the factual background presented.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. At the hearing in the Upper Tribunal, Mr Bramble conceded that not only
    had Judge Wyman materially erred in  law,  but  also  that  the  appeal
    should be remade in the  appellant's  favour.   He  accepted  that  the
    refusal  letter  had  taken  no  account  of  the  particular   factual
    background to the application, which  the  appellant's  solicitors  had
    explained in a covering letter  sent  with  the  application.   So  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law.

Discussion

11. Judge Wyman was wrong to find, as he did, that the Secretary  of  State
    had complied with her  own  policy  with  regard  to  legacy  sponsors.
    Following  the  grant  of  interim  relief  by  the  High  Court,   the
    appellant's college was a legacy sponsor.  The respondent  should  have
    allowed the college to assign a CAS to those existing students  of  the
    college who needed to extend their leave in the UK so that  they  could
    complete their course.  The college asked for permission  to  assign  a
    CAS to the appellant and other students in her position more than  once
    prior to the  appellant  making  her  application,  but  there  was  no
    positive response.  So the respondent sabotaged the appellant's ability
    to comply with Appendix A: therein lies the unfairness.

12. The college obtained further interim relief from the High Court,  which
    meant that students were allowed to  continue  in  their  studies  well
    beyond 23 November 2012.  The appellant completed her course  in  March
    2013, as permitted by the High Court, and obtained an  offer  from  the
    University of Sunderland to study an MBA course.  Just before UKBA made
    a decision on the appellant's outstanding application,  her  solicitors
    wrote to UKBA on 20 March 2013 notifying them that the appellant  would
    like to pursue  an  MBA  programme  at  the  University  of  Sunderland
    commencing in April 2013 and that she had received a conditional offer.
     However the University of Sunderland would not accept  her  given  the
    absence of her passport.  The solicitors asked UKBA to  either  release
    her passport with the necessary extension,  or  to  issue  her  with  a
    letter which could be shown to her sponsor,  thereby  allowing  her  to
    obtain a CAS from the University of Sunderland  so  as  to  enable  her
    renew her leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a student.

13. By this letter the appellant's solicitors were effectively amending the
    appellant's pending application.  As  UKBA  well  knew,  the  appellant
    could not follow a new course at her existing college as it was only  a
    legacy sponsor:  it  was  not  registered  for  the  enrolment  of  new
    students, or for the enrolment of old students on new courses. Equally,
    because of her  special  situation,  the  appellant  could  not  simply
    present a new CAS from the University of Sunderland. She  required  the
    cooperation from UKBA which her solicitors had requested.

14. The subsequent letter of refusal did not engage with this request.   It
    also plainly failed  to  take  into  account  the  appellant's  special
    situation, as had been previously outlined in the covering letter  with
    the  application.   Accordingly,  the  refusal  decision  was  not   in
    accordance with the law  and  a  lawful  decision  on  the  appellant's
    amended  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a   student   remains
    outstanding.

15. As a victim of common law unfairness, I consider that the appellant  is
    entitled to the following relief: the issue of a permission  letter  so
    as to enable her to obtain a new CAS; and the decision on  her  amended
    application should be delayed until at least 60 days have elapsed  from
    the date of the provision of such a permission letter.

Decision

15.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law,  and
    accordingly it is set aside and the following decision is  substituted:
    this appeal is allowed on the ground that the decision appealed against
    was not in accordance with the law.  The Secretary of State is directed
    to provide the appellant with a permission letter; and to delay  making
    a decision on her amended application  until  at  least  60  days  have
    elapsed from the date such a letter is provided.

Anonymity


The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision  to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered  whether  to  make  a  fee  award  (rule  23A
(costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005  and
section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).


I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


I make a whole fee award of �140.


Reasons: the First-tier Tribunal should have allowed the appeal.
