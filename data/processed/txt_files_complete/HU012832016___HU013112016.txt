Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Brocklesby-Weller Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, instructed by Alcott Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Majid promulgated on  12  June  2017  allowing  the
    appeals of the respondents against the decisions of  the  Secretary  of
    State made on 10 December 2015 to refuse their human rights claims.

 2. Rule 40 (1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    provided that the Upper Tribunal  may  give  a  decision  orally  at  a
    hearing. Ruled 40 (3) provides that the  Upper  Tribunal  must  provide
    written reasons for its decision with  a  decision  notice  unless  the
    parties have consented to the Upper Tribunal not giving written reasons
    which both Miss Brocklesby-Weller and Mr Sowerby did, it being accepted
    that the judge had erred fundamentally  in  his  consideration  of  the
    appeal

 3. Accordingly, and with the consent of the parties, I am  satisfied  that
    the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside. The appeal is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh decision on all issues.

 2. The appeal must not be listed before First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid


Signed                                  Date:  15 February 2018
