Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M A Kalam  (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant whose date of birth is 15 January 1988 is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh.  This matter  comes  before  me  for  consideration  as  to
    whether or not the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Pedro)  made  a  material
    error of law.  In a determination promulgated on 13 May 2014 the appeal
    against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  to  refuse   entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM was dismissed.

Background

2.    In  reasons  for  refusal  it  was  considered  that   the   appellant
    incorrectly applied under  category  A.  Category  B  applied  where  a
    sponsor was employed for less  than  six  months  as  at  the  date  of
    application.  The sponsor is required to list all employment during the
    twelve month period prior to  the  date  of  application  to  establish
    evidence of income  of  �18,600  over  that  period.   The  appellant's
    evidence showed earnings from 25 April 12 to 8 July 12 of  �17,640  per
    annum.  The appellant failed to submit  specified  documents  including
    P60, wage slips, letter from spouse's  employer  confirming  employment
    and annual salary, a signed contract of employment and bank  statements
    corresponding to the same period  as  the  wage  slips.  The  appellant
    produced no evidence of any savings held.

3.   The Entry Clearance Manager upheld the refusal.   Whilst the  appellant
    may be able to demonstrate that she  met  the  Rules  at  the  date  of
    decision, the Rules require to be met at the date of  application  with
    regard to evidence of specified documents.

4.   The Tribunal found that the sponsor's employment  commenced  less  than
    six months prior to the date of the application. At [10]  the  Tribunal
    found  that the appellant had not produced wage slips for any period of
    salaried employment for the relevant twelve month  period  and  further
    that none were produced at the hearing.

5.   The Tribunal declined to adopt Mr Kalam's submission  that  a  decision
    could be made  having  regard  to  the  evidence  as  at  the  date  of
    decision[11].  The Tribunal considered the guidance in Gulshan (Article
    8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and found no
    good grounds or compelling circumstances.

6.      The grounds of appeal argued that the Tribunal :

    (a)  erred in law by failing  to  consider  the  wage  slips  and  bank
         statements contained in the respondent's and  appellant's  bundles,
         including all wage slips  from  E  &  HCT  Limited  and  Stagecoach
         London; and


    (b)  materially erred by not considering the position as at the date of
         decision; and


    (c)  alternatively failed to consider whether this matter ought  to  be
         remitted to the Entry Clearance Officer in light of the decision in
         MM and Others v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).





Permission to Appeal


7.       Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Simpson on 9 June 2014.  Her reasons were that the Tribunal  failed  to
    take into account documentary evidence of bank statements and pay slips
    included in the  bundles  for  the  hearing.  The  respondent's  bundle
    contained pay slips and bank statements from 3 May 2012 to  5  November
    2012 and the appellant's bundle contained pay slips  from  3  May  2012
    until 4 January 2012.


Error of Law Hearing

8.   Mr Kalam  relied  on  the  two  grounds  of  appeal  and  his  skeleton
    argument.  He accepted that the documents  provided  by  the  appellant
    should meet the requirements under category B.  He submitted  that  the
    relevant date  was  the  date  of  decision  (  Section  85(5)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended). The appellant
    submitted bank statements, pay slips from two  jobs   and  evidence  of
    savings of �57,000 in a bank account.  The Tribunal erred having  found
    no evidence of  wage  slips  or  bank  statements  [15].   Further  the
    Tribunal failed to make any findings on the evidence  of  savings.   Mr
    Kalam acknowledged that this had not been pleaded  in  his  grounds  of
    appeal.

9.   Mr Parkinson referred to the  requirements  under  Appendix  FM-SE  for
    evidence to be produced as at the date of application.   There  was  no
    evidence of any  savings   before  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.  The
    appellant failed to demonstrate that the  financial  requirements  were
    met.  It was clear that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  did  not  have
    adequate evidence in the specified format to cover the specified period
    required. There  was no error of law in the determination.

10.  At the end of the hearing I found no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination. I now give my reasons.

Reasons for Decision

11.  The Tribunal erred by stating in that there was  no  evidence  of  wage
    slips and bank statement [10], when in fact such evidence was  produced
    in the bundles for the hearing.  I find that this is an error  of  law.
    It is not a material error, however, because  that  evidence  fails  to
    meet the requirements of the Rules at the specified  time,  namely  the
    date of application, for the specified period,  and  in  the  specified
    format. I find no error in relation to evidence of  savings;  an  issue
    not raised in the grounds of appeal  and  in  any  event  there  is  no
    sustainable argument in light of the recent decision to overturn  MM  v
    SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin). It is clearly open to the  appellant  to
    make a fresh application.  The Tribunal judge's factual  error  in  the
    determination with regard to the documentary evidence does  not  amount
    to a material error of law.


Decision

12.  There is no material error of law in the determination.

13.    The determination shall stand.
