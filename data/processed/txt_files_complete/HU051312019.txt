Representation:
For the Appellant:     Dr E Mynott, instructed by Maya Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Broe dated 14 July 2019 dismissing the  Appellant's
    appeal against the Respondent's decision of 13 March 2019 refusing  the
    Appellant's human rights claim.

2.   The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh born in  August  1994.  On  4
    June 2006 he was granted entry clearance to enter the United Kingdom as
    a visitor, valid until 4 December 2006. The Respondent accepts that the
    Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 27 June 2006. He would at  that
    time have been 11 � years old.

3.   There is no record of his  having  made  any  further  application  for
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom until an application  made  on  2
    August 2018, when the Appellant was nearly 24 years old,  in  which  he
    applied for leave to remain on the grounds  of  private  life  set  out
    under paragraph 276ADE(1)(v),  as a person aged 18 years or  above  and
    under 25 years  and  had  spent  at  least  half  of  his  life  living
    continuously in the United Kingdom, and  under  276ADE(1)(vi),  on  the
    grounds  that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   his
    integration in Bangladesh.

4.   In support of that application a letter of  representations  from  Maya
    Solicitors dated 2 August 2018 provided that the application was  being
    accompanied by 'documentary evidence of  the  people  supporting  him',
    although I have not seen any supporting evidence dated around the  time
    of that letter. There is a  letter  from  City  Walls  GP  Practice  in
    Chester dated 28 February 2019 which  states  that  the  Appellant  was
    registered at the practice from 23 July 2009 to August  2011  and  gave
    his address at that time in Chester.

5.    In  his  decision  of  13  March  2019,  the  Respondent  refused  the
    application for  reasons  set  out  briefly  at  paragraph  8  of  that
    decision, that 'you have provided insufficient evidence that  you  have
    lived continuously in the UK for more than half your life'.  Further at
    paragraph 11  it  was  asserted  that  the  Appellant  would  not  face
    significant obstacles to  reintegrating  into  life  in  Bangladesh  if
    returned.

6.   The Appellant appealed, his appeal coming before the judge on  10  July
    2019.  The Appellant was represented but there  was  no  appearance  on
    behalf of  the  Respondent.   The  Appellant  had  provided  a  witness
    statement which includes the following passage, 'I confirm that I am  a
    Bangladesh national.  I arrived in the UK as a minor on 27  June  2006.
    I have never left the UK since this date  of  initial  entry  and  have
    spent all my formative years in the UK.  I am now 24 years old.'  There
    were also letters within the Appellant's bundle from:

      i) a Mr Islam dated 25 February 2019 which states in summary  that  he
         had known the Appellant since 2006 through his family;  the  letter
         does not say anything  about  whether  the  Appellant  had  resided
         continuously in the United Kingdom since 2006;


     ii) a Mr Begum dated 21 February 2019 also stating that  he  had  known
         the Appellant since 2009 through family and friends;


    iii) a Mr Hanzalah dated 23 February 2019 stating that he has known  the
         Appellant for many years  and  then  gives  an  assessment  of  his
         character;


     iv) a Mr Ali dated 23 February 2019  stating  that  he  has  known  the
         Appellant from 2006 and that it had  been  around  July  or  August
         (impliedly 2006) when they first met in a community park and played
         football.


7.   In determining the appeal, the judge made the following findings:

         "My Findings


         12.  I have given careful consideration to all of the evidence  and
             documents before me.  The burden of proof is on the  Appellant
             who must satisfy me that I should allow the appeal.


         13.  I note that the Appellant entered this country as a visitor on
             26 June 2006.  This seems to be accepted  by  the  Respondent.
             The Appellant was then a child of 11 years of age.  Mr Maqsood
             (the Appellant's advocate) said that he was abandoned  by  his
             father who returned to Bangladesh where he died.  I note  that
             there is no mention of this in the Appellant's statement where
             he says merely that he is cut off from his family  members  in
             Bangladesh.


         14.  In any event the Appellant was a  child  when  he  arrived  in
             2006.  There was no evidence at all to show how he managed  to
             live.  I do not find it credible that he would not  have  been
             living with adults whether or not they were relatives.   There
             was nothing from anyone to explain how he was living.  I  note
             that he says that he has no relatives in this country  yet  in
             his application it said that he was supported by relatives who
             gave  him  �25  per  week.   There  was  no  evidence  of  his
             attendance at school which would have  been  easy  to  obtain.
             There were no photographs of him as a  child.   There  was  no
             evidence from whoever was caring for him at that time.


         15.  He has provided a letter from a medical practice stating  that
             he was registered from 23 July 2009 to August 2011 but nothing
             before or after those dates.  He was 15 to 17  at  that  time.
             The letter states that he was living at an address in  Chester
             but there is nothing from whoever he was living  with.   There
             are no medical records to show that he attended  the  surgery.
             There is none of the evidence that one might expect of life in
             this  country  such  as  telephone  accounts,   social   media
             activities or involvement with any organisations.


         16.  The Appellant provided the letter from the surgery to  support
             his application and it remains the only  documentary  evidence
             from an official source.  The  Respondent  made  his  concerns
             clear in the Reasons for Refusal Letter  but  the  only  other
             evidence adduced by the  Appellant  is  in  the  form  of  the
             letters and photographs described above.  The  photographs  do
             not show him as a child and none of the authors of the letters
             attended to give evidence.  I note that some of them  live  in
             Birmingham.  There was no explanation for the failure to  call
             any of them to give evidence and I find  that  I  am  able  to
             attach only limited weight to the letters.  There was  nothing
             from the relatives who the Appellant claims support him.   The
             Appellant says that he lives with Mr Miah and he provided  his
             P60 but there is no statement from him and he did  not  attend
             to give evidence.  None  of  the  people  in  the  photographs
             provided by the Appellant attended to give evidence.


         17.  The burden of proof is on the Appellant.  He  must  have  been
             aware that his application was refused because of  a  lack  of
             evidence  yet  he  has  failed  to  address  the  issue  in  a
             meaningful way.  He has not taken the opportunity  to  provide
             evidence which  ought  to  have  been  available  or  to  call
             witnesses who could have given evidence to support him.


         18.  I find that he has failed to discharge the  burden  of  proof.
             He has not proved that he meets the requirements of  paragraph
             276ADE(1)(v).  I do not accept his evidence about his lack  of
             ties to Bangladesh and I am not persuaded that there would  be
             obstacles to reintegration on return."


    The Appellant's appeal was dismissed.

8.   The Appellant appeals in grounds dated 17 July 2019 which  are  couched
    in rather vague terms but appear to argue that the judge erred in  law,
    in summary, as follows:

      i) failing to take into account the 'substantial letters  from  family
         members' that had known the Appellant and  who  had  supported  him
         whilst in the United Kingdom;


     ii) unreasonably requiring photographs of  the  Appellant  as  a  child
         whereas  paragraph  276ADE  does  not  require  photographs  or  an
         explanation as to who might look after an applicant whilst  present
         in the United Kingdom;


    iii) not accepting the GP letter, on the grounds  that  the  judge  felt
         that there were no telephone accounts, social media  activities  or
         involvement in any organisations whereas it  was  inappropriate  to
         place an onus on the Appellant to provide evidence which  he  would
         not have and which would not be the norm for a minor child;


     iv) there was no evidence  that  the  Appellant  had  left  the  United
         Kingdom since his arrival; the judge failed to make any finding  as
         to whether the Appellant had left the United Kingdom.


9.   Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Macdonald in a decision dated 3 September 2019 on the basis  that
    'The judge does not reject  the  Appellant's  evidence  on  credibility
    grounds and it is arguable that he has not provided adequate reasons to
    show why the Appellant does not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE'.

    Submissions

10.  Dr Mynott for the Appellant  argues  that  the  Appellant's  claim  for
    leave to remain on the basis of 276ADE(1)(v) had been made out.   There
    was evidence that he had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2006  and  no
    finding that he had left since. The Appellant was between 18 and 24 and
    he had, on his own account, remained in the United Kingdom for half his
    life.  Dr Mynott argued  that  if  the  judge  was  not  disputing  the
    credibility of the Appellant's account, then  no  adequate  reason  had
    been given for finding that the Immigration Rules were  not  satisfied,
    as the Appellant had himself asserted in his witness statement  and  he
    had been present in the United Kingdom since 2006 and had never left.

11.  It was stated that the Appellant's case was supported  by  the  letters
    from a number of persons (which I have already summarised  above).  If,
    in effect, the judge was challenging the credibility of the Appellant's
    account then in the absence of any cross-examination of  the  Appellant
    and in the absence of any matters  of  credibility  being  put  to  him
    during the  course  of  the  hearing,  then  the  judge  has  proceeded
    unfairly.

12.  Mrs Aboni resisted the Appellant's appeal and  argued  that  the  judge
    had directed himself appropriately in law and had arrived at a decision
    which was open to him on  the  evidence.   There  was  no  satisfactory
    evidence either at the time of application or on the  appeal  that  the
    Appellant had resided continuously in the UK for half of his life.   It
    was open to the judge to find that the Appellant  had  not  established
    his case based on the quality of the evidence that he was relying upon.
     The Appellant had known from the time  of  the  Respondent's  decision
    that the Respondent was of  the  view  that  the  application  was  not
    adequately evidenced but the Appellant had elected to add  very  little
    further evidence to the application.  There was, as the judge noted,  a
    discrepancy between the Appellant's assertion in evidence as to  having
    no relatives in the United Kingdom compared with his assertion  in  the
    FLR form that he had relatives in the UK who supported  him  by  giving
    him �25 per week.  The judge was  entitled  to  treat  the  Appellant's
    credibility as diminished as a result.  The judge was entitled to  note
    that there was a singular absence of evidence which could  normally  be
    expected to have been provided by the Appellant, for  example  evidence
    from persons who had cared for him as a child, evidence of  any  school
    that he might have attended etc.

13.  Dr Mynott, by way of reply, emphasised the point that if the judge  had
    been challenging the Appellant's credibility then the  proceedings  had
    been unfair.

    Discussion

14.  I find that whilst the judge has referred to  certain  matters  of  the
    Appellant's evidence not being 'credible', what the judge has done,  in
    essence, is to find, on the basis of the  evidence  adduced,  that  the
    Appellant has simply not met the burden of establishing to a balance of
    probabilities that he has been present in the United Kingdom  for  half
    of his life.  It was manifestly clear to the Appellant from the content
    of the Respondent's decision letter that the evidence at  the  time  of
    application had been deemed inadequate to satisfy the  Respondent  that
    the Appellant had been present for the relevant period.   The  question
    of whether or not the Appellant had in fact remained in  the  UK  since
    his arrival in 2006 had therefore been placed very firmly in  issue  by
    the Respondent.

15.  It cannot be said that a decision maker, whether the  Respondent  or  a
    Tribunal, is obliged to take a bare assertion made by  a  witness  that
    something is the case (here, that the  Appellant  had  been  physically
    present in the United Kingdom since 2006 and had never  left)  at  face
    value when, in the circumstances of the  case,  it  can  ordinarily  be
    expected for such an assertion to be supported by other evidence.   The
    Appellant's position  appears  to  demand  decision  makers  to  accept
    without question any assertion  made  by  an  applicant  for  leave  to
    remain.  Whilst there is no specified  evidence  that  is  required  to
    establish an application for leave to remain  under  paragraph  276ADE,
    the judge's observations are in essence that one could have  ordinarily
    expected to find the  Appellant's  assertions  to  be  supported  by  a
    variety of other evidence of how he had managed to live in  the  United
    Kingdom; clear evidence as who he had lived  with;  evidence  from  the
    relatives said to have financially supported him to the tune of �25 per
    week; evidence of his attendance at a school; and evidence of him being
    physically present as a child eg by way of photographic evidence of the
    13 years of his life said to have been spent in the UK. The same  point
    is made, in the asylum context, in ST (Corroboration, Kasolo)  Ethiopia
    [2004] UKIAT 00119:

         "15. The fact that corroboration is not required does not mean that
         an Adjudicator is required to leave out of account the  absence  of
         documentary evidence which might reasonably be expected. An  appeal
         must be determined on the basis of the evidence  produced  but  the
         weight to be attached to oral evidence may be affected by a failure
         to produce other evidence in support. The Adjudicator was  entitled
         to comment that it would not have been difficult for the  Appellant
         to provide a death  certificate  concerning  his  brother  or  some
         evidence to support his contention that he  had  received  hospital
         treatment. These  were  issues  of  fact  for  the  Adjudicator  to
         assess."


16.  The reference  to  the  judge  finding  certain  matters  not  credible
    represents a finding that it was not credible that the Appellant  would
    have been unable to adduce this  sort  of  evidence.   It  is  entirely
    reasonable  for  the  judge  to  have  expected  the  Appellant's  bare
    assertion  to  have  been  supported  by  some  form  of  corroborative
    evidence, in the circumstances of this case.  This is not a  protection
    claim, this is a human rights claim where the Appellant is  obliged  to
    establish his case to a balance of probabilities.  He  had  simply  not
    done so at the time of the application for leave to remain and, on  the
    basis of the judge's findings, he had still not done so at the time the
    appeal came to be heard.  The judge was not imposing a  requirement  of
    corroboration as a matter of law; the judge was using common sense.

17.  I find that there was no procedural unfairness to which  the  Appellant
    has been subjected.  He elected to evidence his case in the  manner  he
    did.  The letters establish very little about where the  Appellant  was
    or what he was doing since 2006; they are extremely thin in detail, and
    the judge did not err in law in placing little weight on  them.   There
    was no error by the judge  not  making  a  specific  finding  that  the
    Appellant had left the UK since his arrival  in  2006.  The  judge  was
    simply finding that the Appellant had failed, due to  the  sparsity  of
    the evidence he had chosen to rely on, to establish  to  a  balance  of
    probabilities, that he had been in the UK continuously since that time.






    Notice of Decision

    I find that there is no material error of law in the judge's  decision.



    The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

    No anonymity direction is made.
