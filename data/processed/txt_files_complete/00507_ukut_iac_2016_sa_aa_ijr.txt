            Before The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey, President




                       Application For Interim Relief

  [Edited and approved version of decision given orally on 11 October 2016]

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr M Fordham QC and  Ms  M  Knorr,  of  counsel,
instructed by Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, on behalf of the Applicants and Mr  D
Manknell, of counsel, instructed by  the  Government  Legal  Department,  on
behalf of the Respondent, at a hearing at Field House, London on 11  October
2016.

 i) By virtue of the decision of the Court of Appeal in ZAT & Ors the  duty
    to admit a person to the United Kingdom under Article  8  ECHR  without
    adherence  to  the  initial  procedural  requirements  of  the   Dublin
    Regulation requires an especially compelling case.

ii) The question of whether the best interests of a child will be  promoted
    by delay is an intensely fact sensitive one.

iii) The grant of interim relief can be formulated  in  such  a  way  as  to
    respect the role and responsibilities of the relevant authorities of  a
    foreign state.

iv) Protection of the best interests of a child should not be outweighed by
    considerations of judicial comity.


                 Decision: Interim Relief is granted in the  terms  of  [36]
hereof

McCloskey J

 1) These are two conjoined challenges brought by two Syrian  children  who
    are siblings aged 15 and 11 respectively.  I emphasise  at  the  outset
    that both have been granted the protection of anonymity.

 2) This is an urgent application for interim relief.   It  is  brought  in
    circumstances where the pre-litigation phase, which  was  triggered  by
    the first of several letters written  by  the  Applicants'  solicitors,
    occupied a period  of  approximately  one  month,  beginning  in  early
    September 2016.   The  proceedings  themselves,  which  incorporate  an
    application for urgent consideration, were initiated precisely one week
    ago.

 3) Both the Tribunal and, indeed, the parties' representatives are working
    to very tight timescales for a variety of reasons. Furthermore there is
    the self-evidently important fact of the ages and circumstances of  the
    two Applicants.  I have for these reasons decided to give  my  decision
    today without any delay and I shall express it  in  relatively  compact
    terms.

 4) It is appropriate to highlight at the outset that the factual matrix of
    these proceedings both illustrates and fortifies the truism that  every
    case of this species is unavoidably and intensely fact-sensitive.

 5) I shall summarise the legal framework as follows.  At this stage of the
    proceedings the Applicants do not assume the  burden  or  confront  the
    hurdle of having to make good their entitlement  to  substantive  final
    relief.  This is, rather, an application for interim relief which falls
    to be determined by the application  of  well  established  principles.
    These have  not  been  contentious,  unsurprisingly,  in  the  parties'
    respective submissions.

 6) The first of the two governing tests requires  the  court  to  make  an
    assessment of whether there  is  a  real  prospect  of  the  Applicants
    establishing at the stage of a notional future substantive hearing that
    theirs is an especially compelling case under Article 8  of  the  Human
    Rights Convention.  That is the test which has been formulated  by  the
    Court of Appeal in two successive decisions, first in CK  (Afghanistan)
    [2016] EWCA Civ 166 at [52] and affirmed in the recent Court of  Appeal
    decision in Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  ZAT  &  Ors
    [2016] EWCA Civ 810.

 7) There are, as was stated in CK  (Afghanistan)  at  [9],  two  competing
    legal imperatives in play.  The first is the vindication of the  Dublin
    r�gime which at inter-state level distributes between the Member States
    of the European Union  responsibility  for  the  determination  of  the
    asylum  claims  of  third  country  nationals.   The  second   is   the
    vindication of individual claims  of  right  (in  this  instance  under
    Article 8 ECHR) which might be denied by the  rigorous  enforcement  of
    the Dublin r�gime.

 8) In cases of this kind it is also essential to grapple with the need for
    urgent judicial and host state intervention (on the one hand)  and  the
    advantages, merits and imperatives of  full  adherence  to  the  Dublin
    Regulation r�gime (on the other).

 9) The Court of Appeal's decision in ZAT confirms the correctness of  this
    Tribunal's conclusion that Article 8 ECHR can in principle provide  the
    basis of a remedy in this kind of case provided that the  threshold  of
    an especially compelling case is overcome.  This  is  an  elevated  and
    challenging threshold.

10) This threshold has to be calibrated in the context  of  an  application
    for interim relief as my formulation in [6] above  makes  clear.   This
    involves  posing  the  question  of   whether   the   Applicants   have
    demonstrated that they have a real  prospect  of  establishing  at  the
    notional trial stage that theirs is an especially compelling case under
    Article 8 of the Convention.

11) The Court of  Appeal  decision  in  ZAT  confirms,  without  exhaustive
    prescription I would emphasise, that certain factors may  be  material.
    These are, first, a litigant's health  (in  that  case  it  was  mental
    health); second, the status of unaccompanied  minor;  and,  third,  the
    speed at which the Dublin Regulation process is  capable  of  providing
    the ultimate goal of family reunification.

12) It is trite to add that factors of this kind will  invariably  be  case
    and context sensitive.   Each  of  these  factors,  as  Mr  Fordham  QC
    submitted, is present in the instant case.  Each has to be examined  in
    the prevailing context and by  reference  to  the  evidence.   At  this
    juncture, I say  the  following  about  the  evidence  which  has  been
    assembled.  It is, as it was in ZAT, unilateral and untested.   I  have
    considered it critically and at its reasonable  zenith.   I  have  also
    taken into account the Respondent's approach to it in both written  and
    oral argument,  which  was  essentially  (and  properly)  a  stance  of
    neutrality.  Having done so, I find no reason to doubt  or  reject  the
    central tenets of the evidence before the Tribunal.

13) First there is the expert psychiatric evidence, to  which  I  now  turn
    briefly.  This is constituted by, firstly the reports of a professional
    psychiatric social worker.  These deal with the two Applicants.  In the
    first of these reports it is  recorded  that  in  interview  the  older
    Applicant stated that she often thought of  throwing  herself  under  a
    moving vehicle.  Continuing, she indicated that since arrival in France
    her thoughts of suicide  had  increased.   She  recounted  in  layman's
    language (and this is my formulation), that she  and  her  brother  had
    become increasingly dejected and depressed with the passage of time.

14) The word "suicide" was also used by the younger of the  two  Applicants
    when he was interviewed.  These interviews must be considered in  their
    context, which   includes the  history  given  by  both  Applicants  of
    horrific  experiences  during  their  early  years   in   Syria.    The
    professional assessment was that there was a risk of  suicide  in  both
    cases, higher in that of the older Applicant.  This  was  supported  by
    the fact that the older Applicant had a suicide plan, frequent  suicide
    impulses and continuing opportunities to execute the plan.  This report
    also adverts to the risk of accidental harm on  a  freestanding  basis.
    Turning to the  future,  the  expert  opinion  expressed  is  that  the
    children's ability to trust would deteriorate further and make it  even
    more difficult for them to receive psychological support in the  future
    in the event of the status quo continuing for them.

15) The second report is that of Dr Fairweather, who specialises  in  child
    and adolescent psychiatry.  At this stage she had not  assessed  either
    of the Applicants directly.  She reviewed the evidence,  in  particular
    the  aforementioned  report  of  the  professional  psychiatric  social
    worker.  Having done so, she expressed the clear opinion that the risks
    identified in the report of the former needed to  be  urgently  managed
    for the  safety  and  wellbeing  of  both  children.   Continuing,  she
    considered it evident that these risks could not be adequately  managed
    in their prevailing circumstances.  She went on:

    "Only reunification with  family  members  in  the  UK  whom  they  are
         familiar with and trust will result in reduction in this  risk  and
         improvement in their mental health.  They will not be able to begin
         the process of recovery and rehabilitation until they are somewhere
         which is both objectively  safe  and  free  from  danger  and  they
         perceive as safe."

16) Dr Fairweather then considered the objective reality that some measures
    could be put in place in  France  but  explained  why  these  would  be
    manifestly  inadequate  and  would  not  make  any  difference  to  the
    children's subjective state.  She continues:

    "It is important to highlight that admission to a psychiatric  facility
         in France would do very little to  reduce  their  risk  of  suicide
         because it would only provide  environmental  containment  but  not
         alter the reality of their situation."

She expressed the same view with regard  to  psychotropic  medication.   She
    stated:

    "My strong opinion is that  the  immediate  intervention  needs  to  be
         reunification with their family members.  They will then need their
         mental health re-assessed following this."

17) Dr Fairweather, in a later report, has endorsed unreservedly  the  more
    comprehensive assessment of the two Applicants during the  most  recent
    phase of these proceedings, culminating in  lengthy  reports  dated  09
    October 2016.  The more striking of the reports is that relating to the
    older girl.  The author considered,  inter  alia,  how  this  girl  was
    coping.  She  suggested  that  she  appeared  to  be  coping  but  only
    superficially, sustained only by her sense of duty in  caring  for  her
    younger brother (the second Applicant) and her ever  receding  hope  of
    reaching the United Kingdom  thereby  achieving  family  reunification.
    The author further observes that it is not clear for how long the first
    Applicant can sustain this hope.

The report continues:

    "Her mental health will deteriorate the longer the situation continues.
          She is at high risk of developing a co-morbid depressive  disorder
         with increase in her suicidal ideation.  It is very likely that  in
         this state she would at least attempt suicide.  It  is  clear  that
         she has access to  her  contemplated  method  of  suicide  that  is
         jumping in front of a car.  She is also at risk of accidental death
         when attempting to come to the United Kingdom unlawfully. Therefore
         the impact of delay in  transfer  is  extremely  serious  with  the
         potential of life threatening consequences."

The report further states:

    "While an improvement in her accommodation circumstances here in France
         may to a limited extent benefit her in terms of  the  risk  to  her
         safety and physical health it will  do  nothing  to  address  other
         risks to her such as her vulnerability and  risk  of  suicide.   It
         will not be sufficient to address her mental health, developmental,
         social, cultural and educational needs.  Therefore  improvement  in
         her living conditions will not be adequate to meet her needs."

The unqualified terms in which this series  of  opinions  is  expressed  are
    unmistakable  and  striking.   The  strong   and   unequivocal   expert
    recommendation is reunification with an adult member of the  family  as
    quickly as possible.

18) I juxtapose this evidence with that  provided  by  the  relevant  other
    family member.  This is the older brother, aged 30, who  is  living  in
    the United Kingdom.  I take into account in particular what he has said
    in relation to the two Applicants.  This evidence also is expressed  in
    balanced and measured terms and at this early stage of the  proceedings
    I have no reason to doubt or reject its main elements.  He  too  speaks
    of increasing desperation on the part of the  two  Applicants  and  the
    progressive and rapid erosion of their faith, trust and  hope,  all  of
    which (I observe) are critical ingredients in their  extremely  fragile
    and vulnerable mental condition.  In summary,  the  expert  psychiatric
    evidence is powerful, unambiguous and compelling.

19) I turn to consider the second of the factors which  was  recognised  in
    ZAT as capable of being material in the application of the  overarching
    test.  For the purposes of this interim  relief  application  there  is
    sufficiently clear evidence before the Tribunal that the Applicants are
    who they claim to be, namely they are Syrian nationals  who  have  fled
    their country; they are aged 15 and 11 respectively; they are siblings;
    there is no parent  or  parental  figure  in  their  lives;  they  are,
    therefore unaccompanied minors; and their older brother sibling, who is
    a mature adult now aged 30, is living in  the  United  Kingdom  and  is
    capable of accommodating them.

20) The third of the  three  factors  which  I  have  summarised,  also  an
    intensely context specific one, places the spotlight on the evidence of
    the Applicants' interaction with the French Dublin  Regulation  process
    and arrangements  to  date.   In  contrast  with  certain  other  cases
    (including ZAT) the Tribunal  is  not  involved  here  in  an  abstract
    exercise of examining general evidence of this  nature.   Rather  these
    Applicants have interacted  directly  with  the  system  and  there  is
    evidence of what form this has taken, how far it has progressed and how
    efficient and effective it has been for them.

21) The evidence establishes, amongst other things, that there was  created
    at the beginning of June 2016 a pilot project.  It is recorded  in  the
    report of the Red Cross that this  was  in  effect  a  state  sponsored
    project.  It involved the organisation  FTDA  (France  Terre  d'Asile).
    The project entailed the French government mandating this  organisation
    to receive  and  issue  registrations  to  claim  asylum  and  to  book
    appointments at the Pr�fecture.  This gave rise to an agreement between
    FTDA and the  charitable  organisation  known  as  Safe  Passage.   The
    project period was expressly stated to be 01  June  to  01  July  2016.
    There is unequivocal evidence that the two Applicants were assigned  to
    this project.

22) In the event the project availed the Applicants nothing.   Their  cases
    had got nowhere when this short lived project came  to  an  end  on  an
    unspecified date in early July 2016, marking the end of  the  first  of
    two identifiable phases.   While  the  reasons  for  this  failure  are
    unclear, this is the indelible fact.  In particular, there is no  clear
    evidence, direct or inferential, that the Applicants or  any  of  their
    family  members  or  representatives  are  to  be  faulted   for   this
    regrettable state of affairs.

23) I pause to observe that, notably, four  weeks  was  identified  by  the
    experts and professionals of these two organisations and, I add,  those
    with whom they were presumably interacting on behalf of the French  and
    United Kingdom governments as the appropriate period for the processing
    of a Dublin Regulation application in France and the registration of  a
    take charge  request  with  the  relevant  English  authorities.   This
    related to the cohort of persons in  France  who  were  seeking  family
    reunification in the United Kingdom.

24) I turn to examine the second important phase,  which  begins  with  the
    conclusion of the pilot project in early July  2016  and  continues  to
    date.  During this period the Applicants' interaction with  the  French
    system and French authorities has included three events in particular.

25) First, on 27 August 2016 the appropriate French  court  made  an  order
    directing the relevant Pr�fecture to appoint an administrator.  This is
    an essential step in the case of minor children who are seeking  refuge
    under the Dublin Regulation system in France.  Second, in a context  of
    non-compliance, on 14 September 2016  enforcement  proceedings  against
    the Pr�fecture were initiated.  Third, and most recently, on 04 October
    2016 the administrator was appointed.

26) The most recent evidence of the process is contained in an  email,  the
    author whereof is a French government official.  He is described as the
    Head of the Dublin  section  in  the  D�partement  de  l'Accueil  �  la
    Proc�dure d'Asile (the French Government Department of Asylum).  On  04
    October  this  official  reported  that  the  administrator  had   been
    appointed that morning.  The communication continues:

    "The minors should be received very soon and  the  request  to  the  UK
         Dublin unit will follow."

That  is  updated  still  further  by  the  most  recent  statement  of  the
    Applicants' solicitor, Mr Scott.  This was signed and dated  yesterday,
    10 October 2016.   This  refers  to  an  "open"  appointment  with  the
    administrator on yesterday's date, consequent  upon  the  first  direct
    contact between the children and the administrator  the  previous  day.
    Mr Scott, elaborating, explains that he checked throughout  the  course
    of yesterday in order to ascertain what progress had been made  at  the
    Pr�fecture.  The last contact indicated that the  children  were  still
    there.  It was not clear whether registration had taken place.  At this
    point the evidential matrix ends.

27) I return to what the senior French  government  official  said  in  the
    electronic communication of 04 October 2016:

    "The minors should be received very soon and  the  request  to  the  UK
         Dublin unit will follow."

It is difficult to confidently interpret the first  part  of  the  statement
    and I decline to speculate on what has been lost here  in  translation.
    However, on any showing, this statement resolves and reduces to a  bare
    assertion of further and future progress in vague, unparticularised and
    aspirational terms.  It contains no timetable, even indicative.

28) In these circumstances I consider  the  need  for  swift  and  decisive
    judicial adjudication unmistakable.  One option for this Tribunal today
    is to wait and see.  I debated that with the parties'  representatives.
    Having done so, I have concluded that this would entail  an  abdication
    of judicial responsibility which, in my judgement, is not  justifiable.
    I elaborate on this as follows.

29)  I  take  into  account  Mr  Manknell's  submission  relating  to   the
    intervention of a judicial organ of this  state  in  the  circumstances
    prevailing.  Contrary, however, to what he submitted such  intervention
    will not entail any trespass or intrusion vis-�-vis the French judicial
    authorities.  They have, for the moment, completed their  function  and
    the relevant authorities involved at  present  are  the  administrative
    authorities.

30) Mr Manknell further pointed out what was stated in ZAT by the Court  of
    Appeal relating to the advantages which may be conferred on children by
    delay rather than speed.  That argument is well made in  the  abstract.
    However, the evidence in these proceedings,  including  the  electronic
    communication of 04 October 2016, contains clear indications of how the
    Applicants'  best  interests  have  been  assessed  to  date  and  will
    ultimately be assessed.  The clear implication of  the  email  is  that
    this case is a proper and suitable candidate for a take charge  request
    in circumstances where the only responsible adult in  the  equation  is
    their 30 year old brother in  the  United  Kingdom.  This  analysis  is
    reinforced by the psychiatric evidence in  its  totality  and  the  two
    witness statements of the Applicants' older brother. Furthermore,  this
    issue can be adequately addressed in a suitably tailored judicial order
    (infra). Accordingly the submission from  Mr  Manknell  on  this  issue
    cannot be accepted.

31) Further, and in any event, the passage in the decision in R (Dudaev)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] 3 CMLR 37,  at  [67],
    upon which Mr Manknell relied, does not in my judgement  apply  in  the
    present context.  In this passage  Burnett  LJ  expressed  reservations
    about the approach of the claimants.  He described it as one  which  in
    effect sought to set up the England court as a forum for appealing  the
    decisions of the Swedish Migration Court and Court of Appeal.  That  is
    very far removed from the present  litigation  context.   I  need  not,
    therefore, elaborate on the question of English judicial  interventions
    which might be considered to upset the  delicate  balance  of  judicial
    comity between the  courts  of  two  advanced  western  democracies  in
    circumstances where the best interests of a child are crying out for  a
    particular course of judicial action.  This interesting question  will,
    foreseeably require more detailed consideration in  a  suitable  future
    case. Given that the Court of Appeal  in  Dudaev  did  not  purport  to
    prescribe any absolute prohibition, it is possible in the  abstract  to
    conceive of cases where the overwhelming  best  interests  of  children
    would not be sacrificed on the altar of judicial comity.   That  issue,
    however, simply does not arise in the present case.

32) Nor does [95] of ZAT  operate  to  defeat  the  Applicants'  quest  for
    interim relief for the   reason that they have invoked and pursued  the
    French system. Further, and in any event, Mr Manknell's  submission  on
    this discrete issue overlooks both the general nature of the  principle
    formulated by Beatson LJ in this passage and the illustrative character
    of the illustration provided (which, as it happens,  was  a  real  case
    before this Tribunal, proof that truth is  indeed  frequently  stranger
    than  fiction).  I  consider  it  clear  that  the  Court   of   Appeal
    deliberately avoided exhaustive prescription in the words chosen.

33) The centrepiece of the Applicants' case is  the  psychiatric  evidence.
    This evidence establishes beyond peradventure that any further delay in
    family  reunification  for  them  could   have   the   most   appalling
    consequences for either or both of them.  There is  no  more  appalling
    consequence than the loss of their lives.  I simply cannot  countenance
    a judicial decision which would permit the continuance, rather than the
    abatement,  of  this  stark  and  awful  risk  in  circumstances  where
    abatement can be achieved.  It is this factor which ultimately tips the
    balance in the application of both of the tests for interim relief.  It
    outweighs the argument, which could be a powerful one  in  a  different
    case and in a different context, that judicial  restraint  rather  than
    judicial intervention is the  appropriate  course  because  the  French
    Dublin Regulation process appears to be well advanced.   This  argument
    is defeated by the stark, compelling and uncompromising  terms  of  the
    expert psychiatric evidence.

34) In the circumstances outlined above, I consider that  the  options  for
    this Tribunal, a public authority under Section 6 of the  Human  Rights
    Act 1998, resolve to the single course of action of  acceding  to  this
    application for interim relief.  I would add that, quite properly,  the
    parties' submissions concentrated almost exclusively on  the  first  of
    the governing tests, namely that of real prospect of ultimate  success.
    In  the  particular  context  of   these   proceedings,   no   separate
    consideration of particular substance arises in the application of  the
    second test, namely the  balance  of  convenience.   There  is  nothing
    before me to suggest that the application of this test inclines towards
    refusing the Applicants' quest for interim relief.

35) Finally, I observe that the potentially  interesting  question  of  the
    applicability of the  state's  positive  duty  to  protect  life  under
    Article  2  ECHR  has  not  arisen  in  the  present  case.   This  may
    conceivably be canvassed in a suitable future case.

36)  Having considered the submissions of the parties' respective counsel I
    make the following order:



Order

      i) The Applicants are not to be identified and will be known as SA and
         AA respectively.  Similarly,  in  furtherance  of  their  anonymity
         protection their Litigation Friend will be anonymised as AA2.

    There  shall  be  no  publication  of  any  information  of  any   kind
         identifying  or  having  the  potential  to  identify  either   the
         Applicants or any of their family members.

     ii) The Secretary of State shall admit the  Applicants  to  the  United
         Kingdom.

    iii) I reserve costs.

     iv) There will be liberty to apply.

      v) I will, if desired and appropriate, relist  the  case  for  further
         consideration on a date to be agreed between the parties.

37) I wish to elaborate on [ii] of the order.  This is an order  framed  in
    mandatory  terms.   In  subjecting  the  Secretary  of  State  to   the
    obligation  to  admit  the  Applicants  to  the   United   Kingdom   no
    qualification has been added.  In  particular,  no  timetable  or  time
    limit has been ordered by the Tribunal.  The significance  of  this  in
    the present case is that the Applicants are under the  supervision  and
    care of the French authorities.  This order does not speak directly  to
    them and can have no consequences  for  the  discharge  by  the  French
    authorities of their legal obligations to the Applicants  under  French
    law.  The  final  assessment  of  the  Applicants'  best  interests  is
    respected and accommodated in this way and is further reinforced by the
    provision for liberty to  apply,  which  will  accommodate  all  future
    eventualities.








       Signed:
                    The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey
                    President of the Upper Tribunal
                    Immigration and Asylum Chamber


       Dated:     11 October 2016 (orally)
