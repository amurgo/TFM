For the Appellant:     Ms G. Patel, Counsel instructed by Broudie Jackson
                       and Canter
For the Respondent:    Mr C. Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  The  Appellant  is  a  national  of  Iran  born  in  1961.  He   seeks
    international protection on the grounds that he has a well-founded fear
    of persecution in Iran for reasons of his imputed political opinion.


 2. By its decision of the 18th July 2017 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge PJ
    Holmes) allowed the Appellant's appeal with reference to Article  3  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights. That  decision  has  not  been
    appealed by the Respondent and is undisturbed.

 3. The matter in issue in this onward  appeal  is  whether  the  Appellant
    should be excluded from the protection of  the  Refugee  Convention  by
    virtue of Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention:


               The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any
         person with   respect to whom there are serious reasons for
         considering that:


            (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a
         crime    against    humanity, as defined in the international
         instruments drawn up to
            make provision in respect of such crimes;"




    Anonymity Order

 4. The Appellant has been granted international  protection.   Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    The Findings of the First-tier Tribunal


 5. Before me the parties agreed that the facts, as accepted by the  First-
    tier Tribunal, were as follows:


               . The Appellant served as  a  member  of  the  Iranian  armed
                 forces during the Iran-Iraq war in 1980-1988 [�24]


               . In 1986 he was stationed in the southern Iraqi marshes near
                 the Majnoon oilfield when he was ordered to participate  in
                 firing new ammunition which was identified to the Appellant
                 as being chemical weapons (mustard gas) [�29]

               . The Appellant initially refused the request of a person  in
                 civilian clothing  to  fire,  but  upon  command  from  his
                 commanding officer did so, in the belief that he  would  be
                 shot if he refused

               . The gun was  used  for  approximately  40-50  minutes,  the
                 shells being aimed  at  Iraqi  Army  positions  on  Majnoon
                 Island

               . In 2012 the Appellant was  approached  by  members  of  the
                 security forces and asked to  take  part  in  training  new
                 recruits, as an  old  army  colleague  had  done.   He  had
                 refused.  It emerged that the colleague had told a class he
                 was training about the incident near  Majnoon  Island,  and
                 that he had subsequently  disappeared,  after  having  been
                 driven to work by members of the Sepah. The  Appellant  had
                 fled Iran fearing that the Sepah somehow suspected  him  of
                 complicity in the leaking of the state  secret,  that  fear
                 arising from the fact that the Etelaat attended his  family
                 home and conducted a  search  of  it,  whilst  telling  the
                 Appellant's daughter that they were looking for him.


 6. From these findings of fact the First-tier Tribunal drew the  following
    legal conclusions. The claim is one capable  of  engaging  the  Refugee
    Convention in that the feared harm was for  reasons  of  the  political
    opinion imputed to the Appellant [�20].  The use of chemical weapons is
    unquestionably a war crime: Article 8.2 (b) (xviii) of the Rome Statute
    of the ICC ("employing asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and  all
    analogous liquids, materials or devices")  [�28].   The  Appellant  had
    admitted his participation in that crime [�30] and thus actus reas  was
    proven.  As to mens rea the Tribunal directed itself to Article  30  of
    the Rome Statute which requires that the person intended to  engage  in
    the activity in question (loading and firing the  mustard  gas  shells)
    and that he knew the consequences (the asphyxiation of  Iraqi  troops).
    The Appellant's defence of duress failed - for reasons I explore  below
    - and as a result he must  be  excluded  from  the  protection  of  the
    Refugee Convention by virtue  of  Article  1F  thereof  [�35].  He  had
    however established himself to be at a real risk of serious harm should
    he be returned to Iran and his appeal therefore fell to be  allowed  on
    Article 3 grounds [�36 & 39].


 7. The First-tier Tribunal's  reasoning  on  the  Appellant's  Article  1F
    defence is set out at its �30-34.   The Tribunal  directs  itself  that
    duress is a defence under Article 31(1)(d) of the Rome Statute:

         Article 31 Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility


         1.  In  addition  to   other   grounds   for   excluding   criminal
         responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall not  be
         criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:
         ...
         (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime  within  the
         jurisdiction of the Court has been caused by duress resulting  from
         a threat of imminent death or of  continuing  or  imminent  serious
         bodily harm against that person or another person, and  the  person
         acts necessarily and reasonably to avoid this threat, provided that
         the person does not intend to cause a greater  harm  than  the  one
         sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:


            (i) Made by other persons; or


            (ii) Constituted by other  circumstances  beyond  that  person's
         control.

 8. It goes on to consider the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal  in  AB
    (Article 1F - defence - duress) Iran [2016] UKUT 376 (IAC):

         1. In response to an allegation that a person  should  be  excluded
              under Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention  because  there
              are serious reasons  for  considering  that  the  person  has
              committed a crime against peace,  a  war  crime  or  a  crime
              against humanity as defined in the Rome Statute, there is  an
              initial evidential burden on an appellant to raise  a  ground
              for excluding criminal responsibility such as duress.


         2. The overall burden remains on the respondent to  establish  that
              there are serious reasons for considering that the  appellant
              did not act under duress.


 9. In respect of the burden  and  standard  the  determination  notes  the
    conclusions in AB to the effect that where, in a case  like  this,  the
    Respondent produces sufficiently clear, credible  and  strong  evidence
    that a war crime has been committed, there is an evidential burden upon
    the claimant to raise a defence of duress. The standard of  proof  does
    not need to reach the civil standard but a "merely abstract  danger  or
    simply an elevated possibility that a dangerous situation  might  occur
    would not suffice and the threat relied upon must be objectively  given
    and not merely exist in the perpetrator's mind".   If  that  reasonable
    defence is raised the overall legal burden rests on the  Respondent  to
    show that there are serious reasons for considering that the  Appellant
    did not act under duress.


10. Having regard to the evidential burden on the  Appellant  the  Tribunal
    turns to examine the evidence presented.  The  Appellant  relied  on  a
    report prepared by Ms Roya Kashefi in respect of the operative laws  in
    force in Iran in 1986.  Ms Kashefi was asked "what would be the  likely
    consequences for an Iranian soldier of the rank of commander were he to
    refuse an order from a colonel to fire on  enemy  soldiers  during  the
    Iran-Iraq war in the circumstances described by the Appellant?".    The
    First-tier Tribunal expresses regret  that  only  two  passages  in  Ms
    Kashefi's report actually attempt to answer that question.  Ms  Kashefi
    concluded that had the Appellant refused to  carry  out  orders  "there
    would have been a real possibility" of him being tried as a Mohareb and
    subjected to punishment including the death penalty: the Tribunal finds
    this conclusion to be a "gross  anachronism"  given  Ms  Kashefi's  own
    evidence that the religious offence of Mohareb (trans: "enmity  against
    God") was only introduced into Iranian martial law by Article 29 of the
    2003 Armed Forces Penal  Code,  some  17  years  after  the  events  in
    question.   Her report appears to indicate that  the  law  actually  in
    operation in 1986 was one drafted in 1939 which "clearly  stated  death
    as punishment for any disobedience  or  refusal  of  superiors'  orders
    during a state of war or emergency". To support  that  conclusion,  she
    footnotes a reference  to  the  Iranian  government  website  'majlis',
    citing the relevant passage of the 1939 law in Farsi. Of that reference
    the Tribunal said this:


         "I have visited the website in question and find it to be  entirely
         in Farsi. It contains a huge document arranged  over  400  numbered
         articles. I was nevertheless able to locate  the  article  numbered
         329 in Arabic numerals, and find  that  the  words  quoted  in  the
         footnote (which of course I cannot read, but I  identify  by  their
         shape alone) do appear there, but they comprise only the  first  1�
         lines of a six-line article. If,  which  is  possible  although  Ms
         Kashefi does not say so, this online document represents  the  Code
         in force prior to the 2003 Armed Forces Penal Code, I am unable  to
         say from the evidence before me whether  the  text  represents  the
         original Code, or the post-1992 re-drafts and  amendments  that  Ms
         Kashefi mentions. For all of the above reasons I find myself unable
         to attach weight to Ms Kashefi's opinion."


11. The Tribunal concludes, at �35, that the result of the shortcomings  of
    the Kashefi report is that the Appellant has failed  to  discharge  the
    evidential burden of raising the defence of duress.  That being so  the
    Tribunal declined to go on to  consider  whether  there  were  "serious
    reasons for considering" that the Appellant had not in fact acted under
    duress. The appeal was thereby dismissed with reference to  Article  1F
    of the Refugee Convention.




    The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal


12. Before me at a hearing on the 30th July 2018 the Appellant pursued  the
    following grounds of appeal against the First-tier Tribunal decision:


              i) That the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  in  failing  to
                 treat the Appellant's own subjective fear as sufficient  to
                 discharge the evidential burden of proof;


             ii) The  Tribunal  misinterpreted  Ms  Kashefi's  evidence,  in
                 particular in failing to have regard to her  evidence  that
                 the post-2003 law was the "genesis of the law which was  in
                 force when the Appellant was involved in the testing of the
                 chemical weapons";

            iii)  The  Tribunal  errs  in  failing  to  assess  whether  the
                 Respondent had discharged the legal burden;

             iv) There was an unfairness and procedural irregularity in  the
                 First-tier Tribunal's approach to  Ms  Kashefi's  footnote.
                 She is an academic whose  objectivity  and  expertise  were
                 unchallenged by the Respondent. If  the  Tribunal  had  any
                 reason to doubt the validity  of  her  evidence  about  the
                 operative law in 1986 (ie the death  penalty  enshrined  in
                 the 1939 Code) it  should  have  said  so,  and  given  the
                 parties the opportunity to address its concerns.  The  fact
                 that the Judge was unable to read the Farsi  text  was  not
                 relevant: Ms Kashefi is the expert, she had  read  it,  and
                 absent a specific challenge or reason  to  doubt  that  her
                 interpretation  was  correct,  the  Tribunal  should   have
                 accepted the evidence at face value.

13. For the Respondent Mr Bates opposed the appeal on all grounds and  made
    various additional submissions as to why the appeal  should  have  been
    dismissed, on the basis that this went to the materiality of any  error
    that might be established before me.


14. In a decision promulgated on the 24th August 2018 I made the  following
    findings.




    Error of Law


15. At paragraph 63 of AB  the  Tribunal  summarises  the  five  cumulative
    requirements to be met in order to raise  a  defence  of  duress  under
    Article 31 of the Rome Statute:


           i. There must be a threat of imminent death or of continuing  or
              imminent serious bodily harm;


          ii.  Such  threat  requires  to  be  made  by  other  persons  or
              constituted by other circumstances beyond the control of  the
              person claiming the defence;


         iii. The threat must be directed against the person  claiming  the
              defence or some other person;


          iv. The person claiming the  defence  must  act  necessarily  and
              reasonably to avoid this threat;


           v. In so acting the person claiming the defence does not  intend
              to cause a greater harm than the one sought to be avoided.


16. As AB makes clear, the "threat" mentioned at (i)  must  be  objectively
    well-founded. There is therefore no merit in  the  Appellant's  grounds
    (i) and (iii). The evidential burden  on  the  Appellant  can  only  be
    discharged if all five elements of the defence  are  demonstrated.   If
    the Tribunal did not consider that to be the case, there can have  been
    no error in it not treating the Appellant's subjectively held belief as
    determinative.  The first question before the Tribunal was whether  the
    Appellant's belief that he would be shot if he refused  to  fire  those
    shells was  well-founded.   That  is  the  question  addressed  by  its
    analysis of Ms Kashefi's  evidence,  and  it  was  that  analysis  that
    assumed the greatest significance in the submissions made before me.


17. Ms Kashefi, for reasons not  understood  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    chose to confine her report to a  narrow  legalistic  analysis  of  the
    likely  outcome  of  a  refusal  to  obey  orders  on  a  Persian  Gulf
    battlefield in 1986.  I am similarly perplexed,  and  can  only  assume
    that Ms Kashefi, an expert of considerable standing in  this  Tribunal,
    understood that to be the limited remit of her  evidence.   The  points
    that she makes in her brief report are:

              i) That the punishment  for  such  disobedience  is  currently
                 meted out under the 2003 Armed Forces Act,  Article  29  of
                 which includes provision for the death  penalty  where  the
                 actions of the perpetrator lead to supremacy of  the  enemy
                 over Iran;


             ii) Iranian law was not immediately  reformed  after  the  1979
                 revolution, but took some time to be codified in accordance
                 with Shi'ite sharia jurisprudence;

            iii) The operative law in 1986 was still the old one, drafted in
                 1939. This provided that the punishment for  a  refusal  to
                 obey superiors' orders during a state of war  or  emergency
                 would be death.


18. Having had the opportunity to read Ms Kashefi's  report  myself  I  can
    find no support for the contention in ground (ii) that  the  2003  Code
    discussed at some  length  by  Ms  Kashefi  was  relevant  because  the
    "genesis" thereof was the 1939 Code.  What it says at  paragraph  3  of
    the report is that the Code was redrafted in 1992, again  in  1997  and
    again in 2003. As the First-tier Tribunal note,  the  report  does  not
    explain what amendments if any were made; nor does it  state  in  terms
    that the 2003 Code is in essence the same as that in force  from  1939,
    albeit with a more religious veneer.   There is therefore no  merit  in
    ground (ii).  That leaves ground (iv).


19. Ms Patel's complaint is that absent any challenge to her objectivity or
    expertise Ms Kashefi's evidence  should  have  been  accepted  with  no
    further investigation into her sources. Thus when she  wrote:  "Article
    329 of the 1939  laws  clearly  stated  death  as  punishment  for  any
    disobedience or refusal of superiors' orders during state of war"  that
    was sufficient to discharge the evidential burden of proof, at least in
    respect of the first of  the  five  requirements  set  out  in  AB  (at
    paragraph 12 above).   She submitted - I paraphrase - that the Tribunal
    had no business checking on the footnote, and that having  done  so  it
    was irrational and unfair of it to reject the evidence  on  the  ground
    that the Judge could not read Farsi. Ms Kashefi can read Farsi and that
    is why she is the expert.   Even if the Judge was entitled to query  Ms
    Kashefi's sources, it was incumbent upon it to raise  any  concerns  at
    the hearing (or, presumably, post-hearing in  written  directions).  As
    Counsel, Ms Patel had been quite unaware of the  Tribunal's  misgivings
    about Ms Kashefi's conclusions  and  as  such  had  not  considered  it
    necessary to address the point.


20. I am not satisfied that it was in any way unreasonable for the Judge to
    read Ms Kashefi's footnote.  Tribunals being offered expert opinion are
    entitled to know the expert's sources and where those sources are cited
    as footnotes, they are entitled  to  have  regard  to  them:  AM  (fair
    hearing) Sudan [2015] UKUT 00656 (IAC).  I  am  nevertheless  that  the
    Tribunal did act unfairly in this case. Having referred itself  to  the
    footnote, and having found questions arising from it, the fair and just
    thing to do would have been  to  invite  further  explanation  from  Ms
    Kashefi and if necessary, comment from the parties: see for instance AM
    (fair hearing) and EG (Nigeria)  v  ECO  (Lagos)  [2018]  UKAIT  00015.
    That need was particularly acute where the  questions  arose  from  the
    fact that the text was in a different language and so not accessible to
    the Tribunal.  The truth is that the Tribunal had no means  of  knowing
    whether the Farsi text on the majlis  website  supported  Ms  Kashefi's
    evidence or not. In those circumstances it was bound to revert  to  her
    and to ask for a translation if it considered, as  it  apparently  did,
    that  the  expert  opinion  in  the  main  body  of  the   report   was
    insufficiently clear.

21. For that reason I set the decision of the Tribunal aside to the limited
    extent identified above.


    The Re-Made Decision

22.  When the hearing resumed before me on the 8th October  2018  Mr  Bates
    for the Respondent indicated that  he  could  no  longer  realistically
    oppose the appeal. That was because in the hiatus between the  hearings
    further evidence had been obtained from Ms Kashefi. In her report dated
    the 27th September 2018 she makes two key points.


23. The first is that the operative law at the date of the war  crime  was,
    as she explained in her first report, Article 329  of  the  1939  Code.
    Under the heading 'Rebellion, Nullifying Orders, Insult, Disobedience -
    Misdemeanour, Felony and their Punishments' the Article provides:

         "Any military personnel who is ordered to advance towards the enemy
         or carry out duties assigned by his superior against the enemy or
         armed insurgents and refuses to do so and the insubordination
         nullifies the order, will be sentenced to death"

    Any ambiguity in her original report is thereby dispelled: in terms  of
    law, the position was that the Appellant faced execution for failing to
    obey orders on the battlefield.


24. The second point made in the report is  that  the  war  with  Iraq  was
    characterised by gross human rights  abuses  on  both  sides.  Examples
    given in Ms Kashefi's report include the Iranian policy of 'human wave'
    mine clearance, in which thousands of young men and children  as  young
    as 9 were driven into the battlefield  to  clear  the  way  for  troops
    advancing behind them. The use of chemical weapons was  widespread,  as
    was the indiscriminate shelling of  civilians.   Ms  Kashefi  concludes
    that since "observing human rights and due process were among the  last
    considerations, if at all" there was a real  risk  that  the  Appellant
    would have been summarily executed had he refused to fire that shell.


25. In view of the Respondent's concession I need not set out Ms  Kashefi's
    evidence in any further detail. Mr Bates accepted that the  defence  of
    duress under the Rome Statute  was  made  out.   The  Appellant  cannot
    therefore be excluded from  the  Refugee  Convention  by  operation  of
    Article 1F and his appeal must be allowed.


    Decisions


26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of  law  such
    that the decision must be set aside to  the  extent  identified  above.
    The First-tier Tribunal decision to allow the appeal with reference  to
    Article 3 ECHR is maintained.


27. The appeal is allowed under the Refugee Convention.


28. There is an order for anonymity.
