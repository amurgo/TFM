                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   On 16th February 2010 Iyngaran, son  of  Sellathurai,  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom with entry clearance as a  Tier  4  Migrant.   Two  days
    before his leave was due to expire on 27th May  2012,  he  applied  for
    leave to remain in order to study for a 'level 5' diploma at the London
    College  of  Social  and   Management   Sciences.    Accompanying   the
    application was a statement of Mr Sellathurai's account with Santander,
    which showed a credit balance of �1,491.58 on 24th April  2012,  rising
    on 10th May to �1,741.58 and eventually  climbing  to  �2,011.58.   The
    application was not determined until 3rd  January  2013,  when  it  was
    pointed out that, in order to score 10  points  for  Maintenance  under
    Appendix C to the Immigration Rules, Mr Sellathurai needed to have kept
    a credit balance of at least �1,600 in his bank account during the  28-
    day period from 24th April to 21st May 2012.  But for the first sixteen
    days of that period, the credit balance in the Santander  account  fell
    short of that figure.   Mr  Sellathurai  had  also  included  with  his
    application a letter dated 25th May from his uncle in Sutton,  Murugesu
    Velananthan, offering financial support and attaching a summary of  his
    Barclays Premier account, showing that in the thirty days up to 8th May
    2012 there had been at least �3,078.20 in that  account.   Those  funds
    could not be used to top up Mr Sellathurai's own funds, however,  since
    paragraph 13 of Appendix C  restricted  the  source  of  funds  to  the
    applicant himself, his parent or  legal  guardian,  and  an  'official'
    sponsor, such as a government or  an  international  organisation.   An
    uncle could not act as a financial sponsor.

2.   The application to vary leave  was  refused  on  'Maintenance'  grounds
    only, and  at  the  same  time  a  decision  was  taken  to  remove  Mr
    Sellathurai.  Nathan & Co. gave notice  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, enclosing a letter of 12th January 2013 from Mr Sellathurai's
    parents in Point Pedro, transcribed below:

             "We are the  parents  of  Iyngaran  and  we  support  our  son
         education in the United Kingdom.  The  some  (sic)  of  [blank]  is
         available for use and his request.  We will forward  the  money  to
         him.  We enclose a copy this birth certificate."

3.   There was  also  enclosed  a  print-out  of  the  transactions  in  the
    parent's bank account for the one-year period ending on  15th  December
    2009.  The print-out was stamped  and  signed,  presumably  by  a  bank
    official, on 10th January 2010. In the  notice  of  appeal  itself,  Mr
    Sellathurai says, "I enclose a letter from my parent's (sic) bank which
    shows that I have the required money for the required period."  As  the
    period covered by the enclosure ended more than two  years  before  the
    "required" period of April-May  2012,  that  was  a  rather  optimistic
    assertion.  The actual ground of appeal was;

             "The decision is not in accordance with the law as I  was  not
         given an opportunity to provide further evidence to show that I had
         the required funds, as required by UKBA policy."

4.   This ground was expanded when Nathan  &  Co.  received  notice  of  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal on 19th April 2013.  It was said
    in Amended Grounds of Appeal that the Secretary of State had failed  to
    apply her policy of 'Evidential Flexibility', under  which  she  should
    have contacted Mr Sellathurai before deciding his application and  told
    him that his uncle could not be used as a sponsor, but  that  funds  in
    his parents' bank account would be acceptable.  In a  statement  signed
    on 16th April 2013, Mr  Sellathurai  says  that  he  is  now  attaching
    "evidence to show for the period of  31st  April  (sic)  2012  that  my
    parents had a sum of 91,066.99 Rupees in credit balance and on 31st May
    2012 that my parents had a sum of 81,351.16 (equivalent to �422.79)  in
    their bank account,  which  would  have  meant  that  I  satisfied  the
    immigration rules."  A photocopy of savings bank transactions has  been
    included in the Appellant's Bundle, which one assumes is  the  evidence
    to which Mr Sellathurai  refers  in  his  statement,  but  it  is  most
    unsatisfactory.  It does not say to whom the savings book belongs.   It
    gives the day and the month of the transactions, but not the year.  And
    one cannot actually discern the two figures given (Rs  91,066.99/-  and
    81,351.16) anywhere  on  the  photocopy.   Some  of  the  photocopy  is
    blurred, and it may be that those figures are hidden  in  that  blurred
    area.  One just cannot tell.

5.   What one can tell is that, by the date of the hearing before the First-
    tier Tribunal, Nathan & Co. had still not provided documentary evidence
    to support the assertion that, during the requisite  28-day  period  in
    April/ May 2012, there were  sufficient  funds  in  his  parents'  bank
    account to cover the shortfall in Mr Sellathurai's own  account.   This
    does not appear to have been noticed by  the  representatives  at  that
    hearing,  or  by  Judge  Wiseman,  who  focused  on  the  'PBS  Process
    Instruction - Evidential Flexibility' which was put before  him.   This
    advises  UKBA  caseworkers  that  they  can  "go  out  for   additional
    information in certain circumstances which would lead to  the  approval
    of the application."  But they "must  have  established  that  evidence
    exists, or have  sufficient  information  to  believe  the  information
    exists."  An example of this would be where there was a series of  bank
    statements, and some were missing.  Judge  Wiseman  accepted  that  the
    proffering of an inadmissible financial sponsor was not quite the  same
    thing, but asked rhetorically whether this was really enough to put  Mr
    Sellathurai's situation completely outside the policy  requirements  to
    make a further  inquiry.   Was  it  not  sufficiently  likely  that  an
    appellant could  well  have  an  appropriate  parental  sponsor  for  a
    shortfall of just over �100?

6.   Judge Wiseman then turned to Annex  A  of  the  Evidential  Flexibility
    document, which lists examples of documents which it may be appropriate
    to request for each Tier.  Under the heading of Maintenance for Tier  4
    we find the following :

        . Missing bank statements from a series
        . Missing information from bank letters
        . Evidence that is copied instead of an original
        . Bank statements not in the desired format
        . Third party maintenance information missing
        . Missing birth certificate needed as evidence of relationship with
          Sponsor

7.   What is being  asked  for  in  the  above  list  is  clearly  secondary
    material.  The existence of the primary material is presupposed.   Most
    obviously, there is already a series of bank statements  in  existence.
    If that were not the case, one could  not  request  statements  missing
    from that series.  But equally, if  a  sponsor  had  not  already  been
    proffered, there would be no need to request proof of the  relationship
    between the applicant and the sponsor.  Thus also, if a third party had
    not already been named as the provider of maintenance, be that a parent
    or an official body, there would be  no  need  to  request  information
    about the third party's ability to maintain  the  applicant.   What  is
    absent from the list is any suggestion that the caseworker  should  ask
    the applicant whether he can find a more suitable sponsor than the  one
    whom he has named  in  his  application.   Yet  Judge  Wiseman  regards
    putting forward an inappropriate sponsor as no more "blameworthy"  than
    failing to provide enough information about an appropriate sponsor.

8.   Judge Wiseman goes on to observe that  there  was  plenty  of  time  to
    contact the applicant in the seven months  which  it  took  the  Border
    Agency to decide Mr Sellathurai's application, which made  it  all  the
    more appropriate and practical to  put  into  effect  what  the  policy
    document says about contacting customers "to correct  minor  errors  or
    omissions in their applications."  In a case  where  the  shortfall  in
    funds was so small, there was "every reason to imagine that there could
    well be an appropriate sponsor for such a small sum."

9.   The appeal was allowed to the extent of "remitting the matter  back  to
    the respondent for fresh consideration."   It had been conceded at  the
    hearing that the removal decision was unlawful, but Judge Wiseman  made
    no separate decision on that.  The Secretary of State sought permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, which was granted by  Judge  Grimmett.
    When the matter came before me, Mr Rana strove valiantly to persuade me
    that Judge Wiseman made no error of law in "remitting  the  matter"  to
    the Secretary of State.  But he clearly  did.   He  does  not  actually
    state the ground on which the appeal was being  allowed.   He  mentions
    "the reintroduction of discretion" into the Points Based System, so was
    it the ground given by s.84(1)(f) of the 2002 Act,  that  a  discretion
    conferred by immigration rules should have been exercised  differently?
    Or was it the ground in  s.84(1)(e),  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law?  This uncertainty is itself an error of law.

10.  Mr Avery contended that the judge had misunderstood the  ambit  of  the
    Evidential Flexibility policy, and despite the best efforts of Mr Rana,
    I have to agree.  Putting up an impermissible sponsor is not  "a  minor
    omission or error."  To use the expressions I adopted  in  paragraph  7
    above, an applicant's choice of  sponsor  is  a  primary  matter.   The
    policy is concerned with secondary matters, i.e. the absence of certain
    information needed to substantiate the primary matter that has  already
    been chosen.  Thus, if a third  party  has  been  put  forward  as  the
    provider of maintenance, but there is not enough evidence to show  that
    maintenance can actually be provided, the caseworker might ask for that
    evidence.  But the caseworker is not expected to assist  the  applicant
    in getting his application right, to the extent of  correcting  primary
    matters, such as the selection of a college, or of a financial sponsor.

11.  It is not actually necessary for me to decide today  what  exactly  the
    scope of the policy is, because on the facts of  the  present  case  Mr
    Sellathurai's application would have been rejected even if a caseworker
    had contacted him and  told  him  that  his  uncle  could  not  be  his
    financial sponsor.  When Mr Sellathurai's  parents  were  contacted  in
    January this year, after the application had been refused, the evidence
    which they sent to show that they could have covered the  shortfall  in
    their son's funds was for the wrong year  altogether,  while  in  their
    covering letter they did not specify how much of their own funds  would
    have been available for their son.  In April this year further evidence
    was supposedly sent from Sri  Lanka  to  prove  that  Mr  Sellathurai's
    parents had adequate  funds  at  the  requisite  time,  but  again  the
    document adduced does not prove that at all.  There  is  no  reason  to
    suppose that Mr Sellathurai would have  been  any  more  successful  in
    obtaining the requisite evidence if he had asked  his  parents  for  it
    last year.

12.  There is no need for me to reach a  concluded  view  on  another  issue
    which came up at the  hearing,  namely  the  relationship  between  the
    guidance to caseworkers contained in  what  I  have  been  calling  the
    policy document,  and  'evidential  flexibility'  introduced  into  the
    Immigration Rules as paragraph 245AA on 6th September 2012, and amended
    on 13th December 2012.  The decision in the instant case was  taken  on
    3rd January 2013, when the rule was in  force.   The  rule  limits  the
    ambit of flexibility to asking that the defects be remedied when  there
    are documents missing from a series, documents in the wrong format,  or
    documents which are copies rather than originals.   Mr  Rana  suggested
    that the letter from Mr Sellathurai's uncle could be "a document in the
    wrong format" under rule 245AA(b)(ii), but  that  is  to  misunderstand
    what 'format' means.

13.  The upshot of all this is that  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal has to be set aside as erroneous in law, and the  decision  on
    the appeal has to be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.  The refusal of the
    Secretary of State to vary Mr Sellathurai's  leave  was  in  accordance
    with the Immigration Rules, and did not involve the misapplication of a
    policy outside the Rules.  On the other hand, however, the decision  to
    remove Mr Sellathurai  was  unlawful.   It  may  be  that,  before  the
    Secretary of State takes  any  further  decision,  Mr  Sellathurai  can
    provide her with information about his current studies and his  ability
    to satisfy the Maintenance requirements of Appendix C, with a  view  to
    obtaining  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  student,  albeit   on   a
    discretionary basis.




     DECISION

     The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed, in respect of  the  refusal
    to vary the respondent's leave.

     The  decision  to  remove  the  respondent  under  section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 is not in accordance  with
    the law.
