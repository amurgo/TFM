For the Appellant:     Ms S. Najma, Riaz Khan & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M. Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Albania whose date of birth is 9th March
    1995.  He appeals  with  permission  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Cox)  to  dismiss  his  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.  It is the Appellant's  case
    that he qualifies  for  a  residence  card  under  the  Surinder  Singh
    provisions in Regulation 9 thereof.


 2. The facts asserted by the Appellant are as follows. On the  18th  April
    2017 he was married to  Ms  Daniela  Bushi,  a  British  citizen.  They
    travelled together to Belgium on the 26th May 2017 with  the  intention
    of setting up a business there. They stayed with Daniela's  cousin.  In
    June 2017 the Appellant took over the running of a caf� there,  and  in
    the same month he was issued with  a  6-month  residence  card  by  the
    Belgian authorities, a permit that was subsequently extended  to  2023.
    In August 2017 the couple rented their own property  in  Brussels.   It
    was their intention to remain there, and to continue running the  caf�.
    In January 2018  Daniela's  mother,  who  lives  in  Yorkshire,  became
    unwell. This necessitated Daniela's return to  the  United  Kingdom  to
    care for her. The  Appellant  followed  and  made  an  application  for
    permission to reside as a family member of  a  British  national  under
    Regulation 9.

 3. Regulation 9 provides:

           9.-(1) If the conditions in paragraph (2) are  satisfied,  these
         Regulations apply to a person who is the family member ("F")  of  a
         British citizen ("BC") as though the BC were an EEA national.

           (2) The conditions are that-

           (a) BC-

                 (i) is residing in an EEA State as a worker, self-employed
                 person, self-sufficient person or a student, or so resided
                 immediately before returning to the United Kingdom; or

                 (ii) has acquired the right of permanent residence in an
              EEA State;

           (b) F and BC resided together in the EEA State; and

           (c) F and BC's residence in the EEA State was genuine.

           (3) Factors relevant to whether residence in the EEA State is or
           was genuine include-

                 (a) whether the centre of BC's life transferred to the EEA
              State;

                 (b) the length of F and BC's joint residence in the EEA
            State;

                 (c) the nature and quality of the F and BC's accommodation
                 in the EEA State, and whether it is or was BC's principal
                 residence;

                 (d) the degree of F and BC's integration in the EEA State;

                 (e) whether F's first lawful residence in the EU with BC
           was in the EEA

                 State.

           (4) This regulation does not apply-

                 (a) where the purpose of the residence in the EEA State was
           as a means

                 for circumventing any immigration laws applying to non-EEA
                 nationals to which F would otherwise be subject (such as
                 any applicable requirement under the 1971 Act to have leave
                 to enter or remain in the United Kingdom); or

                 (b) to a person who is only eligible to be treated as a
                 family member as a result of regulation 7(3) (extended
                 family members treated as family members).

           ....



 4. There were two matters in issue before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
    first arose under Reg 9(2)(a)(i): had Daniela (the  'BC')  demonstrated
    that she had been exercising treaty rights in Belgium? The second arose
    under  Reg  9  (2)(c):  was  the  couple's  residence  in  Belgium  was
    "genuine"?  Having had regard to all of  the  evidence  before  it  the
    Tribunal found against the Appellant in respect  of  the  first  issue.
    Some evidence had been provided that the  couple  had  some  connection
    with a caf� in Belgium, but it fell short of establishing  that  either
    of them owned it or had any involvement in its running. That being  the
    case, the Tribunal made no findings on the second matter in issue,  and
    the appeal was dismissed.


 5. The grounds of appeal, and indeed the grant of permission,  are  almost
    entirely concerned with whether the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  its
    approach to whether the couple's residence in Belgium was "genuine". As
    I explain above, however, in fact  the  Tribunal  made  no  substantive
    findings on the point. The appeal was dismissed because Judge  Cox  was
    not satisfied that the Appellant had demonstrated that Daniela had been
    exercising treaty rights in Belgium: Reg 9(2)(a)(i)  refers.   On  this
    point Ms Najma submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  erred  in
    "failing to give sufficient  weight"  to  the  fact  that  the  Belgian
    government  had  apparently  been  satisfied  that  Daniela  was  self-
    employed.  She submitted that the issue of the  residence  card  should
    have been treated by Judge Cox as determinative of the matter.



    Discussion and Findings

 6. The Belgian authorities  twice  recognised  the  Appellant's  right  of
    residence as a family member  of  an  EEA  national  exercising  treaty
    rights. First in  June  2017  when  they  issued  him  with  a  6-month
    residence permit, and then on the 22nd August 2017 when they issued him
    with a five-year residency card.  It was this latter event, submits  Ms
    Najma,  which  was  of  paramount  significance  in  this  appeal.  She
    submitted that before such a card is issued,  the  Belgian  authorities
    must have been satisfied, on the evidence before them, that Daniela was
    a qualified person. Otherwise there is no way that  the  Appellant,  an
    Albanian national, would have been given a  five-year  residency  card.
    Before me Mr Diwnycz for the Secretary of State accepted that this must
    be right.


 7. Ms Najma makes  two  slightly  different,  but  connected,  submissions
    following from that.  First, she adopts the written ground  that  Judge
    Cox erred in placing insufficient weight on the issue of the  residency
    card.  Whilst it cannot be said that Judge Cox ignored the matter -  it
    is expressly recorded at paragraph  12  of  his  decision  -  Ms  Najma
    submitted the recognition by the  Belgian  authorities  was  plainly  a
    factor that should have attracted significant weight in the  assessment
    of Reg 9(2)(a)(i).  Second, before me she developed  this  argument  to
    its logical conclusion: the issue of the card on the 22nd  August  2017
    should be treated  as  determinative  of  the  question  posed  in  Reg
    9(2)(a)(i). We can be certain that on that date the Belgian authorities
    were satisfied that Daniela was self-employed and running that caf�.

 8. I am not satisfied that either ground is made out.

 9. In respect of the first point, weight is classically a matter  for  the
    Judge, and I may only interfere with Judge Cox's decision if I consider
    it to be perverse. It is far from that.  What  Judge  Cox  did  was  to
    carefully consider all of the evidence before him concerning the  caf�,
    and the couple's connection with it.  He then said this:

         "The Appellant's counsel submitted that I should attach significant
         weight to the fact that the  Belgian  authorities  had  issued  the
         Appellant and the Sponsor with residence cards. I acknowledge  that
         in doing so, the Belgian authorities must have been  satisfied  the
         Sponsor was exercising treaty rights in Belgium. However, I do  not
         know what evidence the Appellant lodged with the  applications.  In
         any event, I can only determine the appeal on the  evidence  before
         me"


10. That statement leads me to the second of Ms Najma's  submissions.  That
    is in effect  that  Judge  Cox  was  incorrect  to  undertake  his  own
    evaluation of the evidence, and that he should  have  gone  no  further
    than to acknowledge the  decision  of  the  Belgian  authorities.   She
    pointed  out  that  consistency  in  decision  making  is  a  desirable
    objective, and that member states  should  be  able  to  rely  on  each
    other's evaluations. That is true.  That is precisely what has happened
    here. Both Respondent and the First-tier Tribunal accepted that  as  of
    the 22nd August 2017 the Belgian authorities  recognised  that  Daniela
    had provided evidence that she was  economically  active.    That  does
    not, however, assist the Appellant. Regulation 9(2)(a)(i) requires  the
    British Citizen to demonstrate that [s]he:


        (i) is residing in an EEA State as a worker, self-employed  person,
        self-sufficient person or a  student,  or  so  resided  immediately
        before returning to the United Kingdom; or



11. Judge Cox was tasked with making an evaluation of whether  Daniela  was
    exercising treaty rights either at the date of the  appeal  before  him
    (ie currently) or that she was doing so immediately before she returned
    to the United Kingdom.  Daniela  returned  to  the  United  Kingdom  in
    December 2017.  Whilst the facts in respect of August are not disputed,
    Judge Cox could only make a finding on the position in December on  the
    basis of the evidence before him. That included, but  was  not  limited
    to, the fact that the Belgian authorities had issued a card  some  four
    months earlier. As he sets out, at paragraphs 25-32 of his decision, on
    balance, and having taken all of that evidence into account,  he  could
    not  be  satisfied  that  the  burden  upon  the  Appellant  had   been
    discharged.  I am satisfied that this was a lawful approach.  The  fact
    that the card was valid for five years itself offers  no  insight  into
    whether Daniela was exercising treaty  rights  immediately  before  she
    returned to the United Kingdom.   The  terms  of  the  Regulation,  and
    common sense, dictates that the focus of the Judge's enquiry had to  be
    December 2017, and the evidence before him.


12. I therefore find that the Appellant fails in his appeal.  I note  as  a
    postscript that whilst  Ms  Najma  was  unable  to  direct  me  to  any
    authority in support of her submission, I  find  some  support  for  my
    conclusions in  the  Respondent's  own  guidance.  In  the  Immigration
    Directorates' Instruction  Free  Movement  Rights:  family  members  of
    British citizens (Version 4.0, published  29th  March  2019)  its  says
    this:


         Presenting a registration certificate issued by the EEA host
         country would not, without further evidence, be sufficient to
         demonstrate that the British citizen was the equivalent of a
         qualified person there. You must consider whether the evidence
         provided shows that the British citizen exercised free movement
         rights as a:


       . worker - for example employment contract, wage slips, letter from
         employer
       . self-employed person - for example contracts, invoices, or audited
         accounts with bank statements, and paying tax and other deductible
         contributions
       . self-sufficient person - for example bank statements
       . student - for example a letter from the school, college or
         university


    Decision


13. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld and  the  appeal
    is dismissed.


14. There is no order for anonymity.
