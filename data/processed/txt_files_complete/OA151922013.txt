                    THE ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, CHENNAI

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:         Miss D Qureshi of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a married female citizen of Sri  Lanka.  Her  date  of
  birth has been given as 14 November 1982. She was refused entry clearance
  to join her spouse in the UK for settlement in the UK by the  respondent.
  Her appeal was allowed by Judge  Raymond,  a  Judge  of  the  First  Tier
  Tribunal following a hearing on 4 April 2014 at Hatton Cross.  The  Judge
  found that the appellant had proved on a balance  of  probabilities  that
  her spouse's income was �19,200, and hence exceeded the minimum  required
  amount of �18,600 per annum.


2.   The respondent sought and was  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the
  Upper     Tribunal by Judge P J M Hollingworth, a Judge of  the  First  -
  tier Tribunal on 2 September 2014.

3.   At  the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Nath,  representing  the  respondent,
  conceded that the grounds of appeal submitted on behalf of the respondent
  were factually erroneous in that at the  date  of  the  application,  the
  appellant had met the requirements of the Rules on finance. Miss  Qureshi
  took me through the relevant documentary  evidence  to  substantiate  the
  concession made by Mr Nath.

   4.     In the circumstances it was clear that permission  to  appeal  had
      been granted on wrongly pleaded facts and that the decision  of  Judge
      Raymond was not in error of law. His  decision  to  allow  the  appeal
      against the respondent's decision must therefore stand.
