                           (anonymity order made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    appellant in  this  determination  identified  as  AR.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings



      1. FtT Judge Abdar dismissed AR's appeal against the  refusal  of  his
         international protection and human rights claim for reasons set out
         in a decision promulgated  on  22nd  January  2020.  Permission  to
         appeal was  granted  by  FtT  Judge  Chohan  on  12th  March  2020.
         Directions for the further conduct of the appeal were sent on  20th
         April  2020  and,  in  the  circumstances  surrounding  COVID   19,
         provision was made for the question of whether there was  an  error
         of law and if so whether the decision of the FtT  Judge  should  be
         set aside to be determined on the papers.

      2. Both parties complied with the directions; the appellant sought  an
         oral hearing in the absence, inter alia, of any indication from the
         Upper Tribunal of its view, there was no Rule 24 response from  the
         respondent  and  the  appellant  had  not  seen  the   respondent's
         submissions, unless the Upper Tribunal was minded to set aside  the
         decision for error of  law  without  a  hearing.  The  respondent's
         submissions were served upon the appellant and the  Upper  Tribunal
         on 11th May 2020. The  appellant  has  not  responded,  as  he  was
         provided  with  the  opportunity  to,  to  those  submissions.  The
         appellant was, on the date of the making of this decision, aware of
         the respondent's position but has not chosen to  respond  or  amend
         his submissions. No application to extend time to  respond  to  the
         respondent's  submissions  has  been  made.  The   respondent   has
         expressed her consent to the decision on error of law  being  taken
         on the papers.

      3. I am satisfied that the submissions made on behalf of the appellant
         and the respondent  together  with  the  papers  before  me[1]  are
         sufficient to enable me to be able to take a  decision  on  whether
         there is an error of law in the decision  of  the  FtT  and  if  so
         whether the decision should be set aside, on the papers and without
         hearing oral submissions.

      4. The appellant relied upon four grounds of appeal:

             Ground 1: that the FtT Judge failed to give sufficient  weight
             to the witnesses' evidence;

             Ground 2: failed to  take  into  account  that  the  appellate
             structure under which the previous appeal was  determined  was
             found to 'incorporate structural unfairness' and to be  'ultra
             vires';

             Ground 3: the FtT Judge has discounted written evidence on the
             basis that it could be explained other  than  the  appellant's
             honest account;  the  FtT  Judge  has  reversed  the  standard
             (counsel presumably means the burden) of proof;

             Ground 4: that the judge made unexplained findings.

      5. Ground 1: the FtT judge did not doubt the sincerity of three of the
         witnesses who expressed their view that the appellant  is  gay  but
         found their evidence unreliable although they may  hold  a  genuine
         belief. The judge set out the evidence of the witnesses in  detail.
         He addressed that evidence in the  overall  context  including  the
         time spent with the appellant. There is  no  contradiction  in  the
         judge concluding that the  witnesses  may  have  a  genuinely  held
         belief with that evidence being unreliable. In reaching a  decision
         the judge took account of the evidence as a  whole  and  given  the
         circumstances of the witnesses' knowledge of the appellant it was a
         finding he was entitled to reach.

      6. Ground 2: the appellant did not rely on this before  the  FtT.  The
         FtT judge specifically raised the  litigation  in  connection  with
         Fast Track with the parties and was specifically informed that this
         was not relied upon. - see [20] and [35] FtT decision. It does  not
         appear, and it is not asserted in the grounds  or  the  appellant's
         submissions in this appeal, that there was such a  submission.  The
         grounds seeking permission to  appeal  assert  that  the  Detention
         Action litigation should have been factored in  by  the  FtT  judge
         when considering the 'starting  point'  for  consideration  of  the
         first appeal. The skeleton argument relied upon  by  the  Appellant
         before the FtT states

             "6.  The Appellant accepts that the findings of Judge Charlton-
             Brown are the starting point ...

             7.   Judge Charlton-Brown's findings re the asylum  claim  are
             at �7.1 - �7.11 of the determination. The tribunal is asked to
             note the reasons for not accepting the appellant  is  not  gay
             are,  to  a  large  extent,  based  on  minor   discrepancies,
             subjective findings  as  to  what  would  or  would  not  have
             occurred, the late  claim,  and  the  appellant's  immigration
             history. Although  no  attempt  is  made  to  undermine  those
             findings, the Tribunal is asked to note the appellant was  not
             in a relationship at that time and he had no witnesses.

             ...

             24.  As above, the appellant accepts, as he must,  that  there
             is an undisturbed determination in which his sexuality was not
             accepted, and he was not believed.

             25.  The appellant does not ask the Tribunal to go behind that
             determination in any way (as he cannot); however, as above the
             judge is asked to note that the reasons why the appellant  was
             found not to be gay are largely based on perceptions  of  what
             would or would not have happened and small discrepancies."

      7. The FtT  judge  set  out  in  his  decision  how  the  guidance  in
         Devaseelan impacted upon his decision making in the instant appeal.
         The judge identified evidence that could not have been  before  the
         first FtT judge and accepted that it had the capacity to permit him
         to depart from the first FtT decision. He set  out  in  detail  the
         evidence before him and, in the case of the person  with  whom  the
         appellant claimed to be living, in the context of  his  appeal  and
         the evidence that was before the judge that dismissed that  appeal.
         The judge considered the fresh  evidence  in  the  context  of  the
         previous evidence. There is no merit in this  ground  of  appeal  -
         given the evidence before him and  the  previous  decision  in  the
         appellant's immigration history, the  judge  reached  his  decision
         utilising the first appeal decision as the correct starting point -
         as was in fact submitted by the appellant's representative.

      8. Ground 3: The judge identified in detail the  evidence  before  him
         and acknowledged its consistency. But  the  judge  considered  that
         evidence, as he was required so  to  do,  in  the  context  of  the
         evidence as a whole not merely as stand-alone evidence. The finding
         by the judge that the evidence was such as could exist between  two
         people sharing accommodation as well as those who  were  cohabiting
         was a finding open to him. It was open to  the  judge  to  consider
         that evidence overall. There has been no reversal of  the  standard
         or burden of  proof.  There  is  no  error  of  law  by  the  judge
         identified in Ground 3.

      9. Ground 4: no further submissions were  made  by  the  appellant  in
         support of this ground of appeal. It seems that complaint  is  made
         that the appellant is described as making "repeated" claims whereas
         he has not and that, combined with the lack of evidence of attempts
         to substantiate his first claim, were indicative of negative points
         against the appellant. The judge sets out the evidence relied  upon
         by the appellant. Whilst the description of 'repeated  claims'  may
         not be totally accurate, the appellant has made two asylum  claims,
         made a JR application and given evidence in an unsuccessful  asylum
         appeal. the misdescription of this as 'repeated' has little  or  no
         bearing on the analysis by the  judge  of  the  evidence  that  was
         before him. The lack of evidence of attempts made to deal with  the
         very clear  adverse  credibility  issues  raised  in  the  previous
         decision and the respondent's decision were matters it was  plainly
         open to the judge to comment upon; but again, they did not  form  a
         core basis of the decision and findings reached  which  were  based
         solidly on the evidence before him.

     10. There is no error of law by the FtT judge in  his  conclusions  and
         findings that the appellant  is  not  a  gay  man.  The  appeal  is
         dismissed.




    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set aside the decision.




    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an  order  pursuant  to  rule  13  of  the
    Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and   Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014.

    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
