                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Jessica Pacey, promulgated on 4th  October  2017,  following  the
    hearing at Taylor House on 14th September 2017.  In  the  determination
    the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent
    Secretary  of  State  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Gambia, who was born on 18th June
    1967.  He appealed against the refusal of entry clearance to enable him
    to join his sponsoring wife, Ms Debra Elaine Fayinke, the  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer being dated 29th September  2016.   He  had
    made a previous application on the same  basis  on  12th  October  2012
    which had been refused also on  12th  February  2013.   The  subsequent
    appeal had been dismissed on 10th  January  2014.   The  Appellant  had
    provided a marriage certificate confirming his marriage to his  Sponsor
    on 23rd August 2012.  The Respondent took issue with this on the  basis
    that the  Appellant  had  on  previous  occasions  provided  a  divorce
    certificate showing he had divorced his previous spouse  on  16th  June
    2006, but the divorce had not been  registered  until  6th  June  2012,
    almost  twelve  years  later.   He  had  produced  a   second   divorce
    certificate stating that the divorce had been registered on  19th  June
    2006.  He now states that this is the original.  The refusal was upheld
    by the Entry Clearance Manager.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge began the observation that  the  Appellant  had  provided  an
    explanation that the divorce certificate previously supplied was  proof
    that the Appellant had actually divorced his previous wife on 16th June
    2006 and that the divorce had been registered on 19th  June  2006,  and
    this was evidenced by a subsequent affidavit.  Whatever  the  position,
    "both the previous marriage certificate and the duplicate  copy  stated
    that the marriage had ended on 6th June 2006" (see paragraph 9  of  the
    determination).  The Appellant's sponsoring wife now, however,  was  in
    employment in the United Kingdom, had family here, had a  social  life,
    and enjoyed a quality of life, such that it was not reasonable for  her
    to leave the UK and go and live in Gambia.  The witness statement of Ms
    Fayinke, the Appellant's sponsoring wife, itself stated  that  she  had
    met the Appellant in 2007 and he had told her that he was  divorced  at
    the time.  She contacted him again in 2012.   She  went  to  Gambia  in
    March 2012 and again in August 2012.  She married him  on  23rd  August
    2012.  The Appellant applied for settlement on the  first  occasion  on
    23rd October 2012.  Her evidence was  that,  "she  could  not  move  to
    Gambia because she had children and family in the UK and had  financial
    commitments.  She  earned  ï¿½65,000  per  year"  (paragraph  11  of  the
    determination).

 4. In evaluating the evidence, the judge observed that, "I have copies  of
    entries in the Register of Divorces (the originals have  been  provided
    in court but not retained) document one states that  the  divorce  took
    place on 16th June 2006 and was  registered  on  19th  June  2006  (see
    paragraph 14)."

 5. The judge went on to state that she had "carefully considered  all  the
    evidence" (paragraph 19).  In doing so, the judge observed that,

         "It is now September 2017 and the partners are still  together,  as
         evidenced by the fact that the Sponsor appeared at the hearing.  In
         my view that is strong and material evidence that the  relationship
         is genuine and subsisting.  There is, therefore, I conclude, family
         life between the Appellant  and  his  Sponsor  such  as  to  engage
         Article 8" (paragraph 24).

 6. The appeal was allowed.





Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application place reliance  upon  the  case  of  Agyarko
    [2017] UKSC 11, where it was stated (at paragraph 25)  by  the  Supreme
    Court that "the mere fact that Mr Benette is  a  British  citizen,  has
    lived all his life in the United Kingdom, and has  a  job  here...could
    not constitute insurmountable obstacles  to  his  'not  being  able  to
    relocate to Ghana to continue his family there.'  The grounds say  that
    the Sponsor has not shown any reason why she may not lawfully settle in
    Gambia.  The  judge  was  wrong  to  have  concluded  that  there  were
    "insurmountable obstacles" to the sponsoring wife doing so.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 12th January 2018 Mr Bramble, appearing  as
    Senior Home Office Presenting Officer  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent,
    began by stating that the grounds were jumbled and inaccurate,  because
    they had been loaded onto  the  wrong  case,  and  this  was  an  entry
    clearance matter, and not a matter involving the removal of  a  person,
    such that they are to show "insurmountable obstacles"  in  relation  to
    their Article 8 rights.  The grounds also wrongly referred to the Court
    of Appeal citation which  was  "not  helpful".   Subject  to  this,  Mr
    Bramble submitted that the judge  had  correctly  evaluated  the  facts
    before coming to the application of  Article  8.   There  had  been  an
    acceptance by the judge that there was family life.

 9. However, she had then gone on at paragraph 31 to cite SS (Congo) [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387, which was focused on the maintenance of  family  life  in
    the UK (rather than being a case involving family life overseas as  was
    the case here, and in this respect the judge had fallen into error.

10. Whilst the judge had begun to examine the  question  of  whether  there
    were "insurmountable obstacles" the judge was wrong to  have  concluded
    that

         "In this case there are obstacles to the Sponsor going to Gambia to
         continue her family life with the Appellant there.  She is now aged
         55, and in my view it would be unreasonable to  expect  someone  of
         that age, with no cultural or blood family ties or  connections  to
         Gambia to uproot and settle in a country  so  very  different  from
         that which she has known all her life".

11. Finally, insofar as Agyarko was referred to, the  judge  was  wrong  to
    have concluded that the Appellant fell  within  its  tenets.   This  is
    because paragraph 48 of Agyarko states the following:

         "If the applicant or his or her partner would face very significant
         difficulties in continuing their family life together  outside  the
         UK, which would not  be  overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious
         hardship, then the 'insurmountable obstacles' tests would  be  met,
         and leave will be granted under the Rules.  If  that  test  is  not
         met,  but  the  refusal  of  the  application   would   result   in
         unjustifiably harsh consequences, such that refusal  would  not  be
         proportionate, then leave will be granted outside the Rules on  the
         basis that there are 'exceptional circumstances'.  In  the  absence
         of either 'insurmountable obstacles' or 'exceptional circumstances'
         as  defined,  however,  it  is  not  apparent  why  it  should   be
         incompatible with Article 8 for leave to be  refused."   (paragraph
         48).

12. Accordingly, what the judge had stated at paragraphs 11 and  25  simply
    did not demonstrate that there were "insurmountable obstacles" or  that
    the Appellant had been able to demonstrate "exceptional circumstances".

13. For her part, Ms Solanki submitted that the reference to a  requirement
    of "insurmountable obstacles" was a digression and,  quite  frankly,  a
    "red herring" because this was an entry  clearance  case  of  a  spouse
    joining for permanent settlement a British citizen settled wife in this
    country, and all they had to do was to show whether they could  satisfy
    the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  requirement   of
    "insurmountable obstacles" only applies under EX.1.  The Appellant  met
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

14. The Immigration Rules clearly set out that applications under  Appendix
    FM reflect how under Article 8 the balance would be struck between  the
    right to respect for private and family life and  the  relevant  public
    interest considerations.

15. With respect to GEN.1.1, what is stated here is that

         "This route is for those seeking to enter or remain in  the  UK  on
         the basis of their family life with  a  person  who  is  a  British
         citizen, is settled in the UK, or is in the UK with  limited  leave
         as a refugee or person granted  humanitarian  protection  (and  the
         applicant cannot seek leave to enter or  remain  in  the  UK  as  a
         family member under Part 11 of these Rules)."

    It sets out the requirements to be met and, in considering applications
    under this route, it reflects how, under Article 8 of the Human  Rights
    Convention, the balance will be struck between the right to respect for
    private and family life and the legitimate aims of protecting  national
    security, public safety and the economic wellbeing of the UK..."

16. Ms Solanki submitted that the judge had in fact erred by going on to  a
    consideration of the "insurmountable obstacles" herself after paragraph
    31 and into paragraphs 32  and  33.   Neither,  is  it  the  case  that
    "exceptional circumstances" have to be shown in a case  such  as  this.
    In short, the Appellant had satisfied the  Immigration  Rules  and  his
    application for entry clearance should be allowed on that basis.

No Error of Law

17. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error of law such that I will set the decision
    aside (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007).  My  reasons  are  as  follows.
    This is a case where the Appellant applied for a spouse's visa in order
    to join Debra Elaine Fayinke, a person present and settled in  the  UK,
    and holding British citizenship.  There had been previous applications.
     These had been refused.  There had been an appeal decision which  also
    went against the Appellant.

18. On this occasion, however, the judge held that, "it  is  now  September
    2017 and the parties are still together" and the  sponsoring  wife  had
    attended the hearing.  The judge was clear that there was  "strong  and
    material evidence that the  relationship  is  genuine  and  subsisting"
    (paragraph 24).  The judge could have stopped right  there  because  at
    that stage there is  compliance  with  the  Immigration  Rules  and  he
    refused it to be allowed.  There was an unnecessary conflation  of  the
    requirement of the Immigration Rules with Article 8 ECHR.

19. However, even more unfortunate was a digression into an  enquiry  where
    "there are obstacles to the Sponsor going to  Gambia  to  continue  her
    family life with the Appellant there" (paragraph 32) because  this  was
    quite unnecessary for the judge to consider once the requirement of the
    Immigration Rules had  been  met.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
    accepted that the suitability requirements were met for entry clearance
    as a partner.  Two of the  three  eligibility  requirements  were  also
    satisfied, namely, the financial  requirements  test  and  the  English
    language test.  What the ECO did not accept was that  the  relationship
    was genuine and subsisting because the ECO could not  accept  that  the
    marriage was valid as the divorce documentation  had  been  questioned.
    This was a matter that the judge had found in favour of  the  Appellant
    in no uncertain terms.  At that point the appeal stood to  be  allowed.
    It was unnecessary for the judge to have gone any further.

20. As for the Grounds of Appeal by  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State,
    these fall into error for two main reasons.  First,  the  grounds  were
    predicated on the assumption that this is an  Appellant's  "  leave  to
    remain application".  The Appellant is not in the United  Kingdom,  and
    has never been, and is  not  making  a  leave  to  remain  application.
    Second, the grounds focus upon  the  judge  having  misinterpreted  the
    meaning of "insurmountable obstacles" which was not a  matter  for  the
    judge  to  consider  given  that  the  Appellant  had   satisfied   the
    requirements of Appendix FM and could demonstrate compliance  with  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, such that his appeal stood to be
    allowed.

Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.

This appeal is allowed.
