Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Wilkins, Counsel instructed by Broudie Jackson
                    Canter Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born in 1974. She  appeals  with
    permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Gurung-Thapa)
    to dismiss her protection appeal[1].

    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. The substance of the Appellant's claim for asylum is that she has been,
    over a prolonged period, subjected  to  sustained  serious  harm  as  a
    victim of trafficking for the purposes of  sexual  exploitation.    The
    core facts are that she was born into poverty  in  rural  Nigeria,  and
    that when she was in her late teens  some  visitors  offered  her  work
    abroad as a housemaid or nanny.  She  agreed  and  her  departure  from
    Nigeria was organised. She was taken to Italy where she was forced into
    prostitution in a brothel containing 22  other  girls.   She  was  held
    there for approximately seven years before being able  to  escape  with
    the assistance of a punter. She was brought to  the  UK  and  ended  up
    seeking assistance from a church and its  congregation;  the  Appellant
    states that in the years immediately prior to claiming asylum  in  2014
    she had been living with a family in London where she was paid in  kind
    for helping with the children and doing housework.

 3.  The  Respondent  had  rejected  the  Appellant's  claim  for  want  of
    credibility, identifying a number of discrepancies in her account.  The
    case had been referred to the Competent Authority and they had  reached
    the same conclusion. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal she was represented
    by experienced Counsel. The case put to the First-tier Tribunal, it  is
    uncontroversial, is that the  Appellant  has  been  unable  to  give  a
    coherent account because she has been mentally  affected  by  her  long
    exposure to "violent and depraved" sexual abuse and  exploitation.  She
    had been diagnosed with severe  Post  Traumatic  Stress  Syndrome  with
    associated psychotic features and she relied upon two reports  to  this
    effect by Consultant Psychiatrist Dr Chandra Ghosh. Dr Ghosh  explained
    that she  had  made  the  diagnosis  having  assessed  the  Appellant's
    symptoms, (as related by her), having taken account  of  "signs"  (i.e.
    his  own  observations  of  her  behaviour)  and  having  checked   for
    corroborative material (in the form  of  her  medical  notes  including
    evidence from her GP and therapists).

 5. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal.  It  found  there  to  be
    numerous  significant  discrepancies  in  the   Appellant's   evidence,
    particularly in respect of what happened to her in Nigeria  before  she
    left for Italy, and in what happened to her in the  UK  after  she  had
    escaped.  Although the determination  does  not  state  in  terms  what
    weight its attaches to the report of Dr Ghosh,  it  implicitly  rejects
    its relevance, finding that Counsel had  failed  to  identify  how  the
    conclusions in the reports were based on anything other  than  what  Dr
    Ghosh had been told by the Appellant. Since the Appellant's credibility
    had been rejected by the Tribunal, it followed that the conclusions  of
    Dr Ghosh, based as they were on an  acceptance  that  the  account  was
    true, were of negligible value.  As  for  the  Appellant  herself,  the
    Tribunal was evidently unimpressed by her decision  not  to  give  live
    evidence at the hearing.  The determination notes  [at  �43]  that  "no
    reasons were put forward as  to  why  she  would  not  be  giving  oral
    evidence", [at �49] that the HOPO was "denied the opportunity to  cross
    examine the Appellant" and [at �51, �52] and that the Appellant  failed
    to rebut  or  give  explanations  for  the  deficiencies  in  her  case
    identified in the Respondent's refusal letter. The  Tribunal  concluded
    that the Appellant's account was a fabrication, that there was no  risk
    of harm and that she could return to her family in Nigeria.

 6. The Appellant has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  against  that
    decision on the following grounds:

         i) Failure to take submissions into account.

            The grounds express surprise at the terms of  paragraph  49  of
            the determination where it  reads  that  "no  explanation"  was
            given as to why the Appellant was not giving evidence.  Counsel
            for the Appellant Ms Wilkins believes  that  she  had  given  a
            reason,  namely  that  her  instructions  were  that  when  the
            Appellant's solicitor had tried to take a witness statement the
            Appellant had become so distressed that it was impossible to do
            so.  It is further submitted that if the Tribunal had concerns,
            or felt there to be a lack of information, it was  procedurally
            improper  for  that  matter  only   to   be   raised   in   the
            determination.

        ii) Procedural Unfairness.

            The Tribunal declined to place any weight on the conclusions of
            Dr Ghosh having applied the guidance in HE (DRC  -  credibility
            and psychiatric report) DRC [2004] UKIAT 00321  to  the  effect
            that where psychiatric  evidence  is  relied  upon  to  support
            credibility submissions, counsel "must identify what  about  it
            affords support to what the claimant has said and which is  not
            dependent on what the claimant has said".

            It is submitted that  this  approach  was  procedurally  unfair
            where Counsel specifically asked  the  Tribunal  if  there  was
            anything further that she could assist with, and where  it  was
            obvious from the face of the report itself what conclusions  Dr
            Ghosh had derived  from  her  own  observations  and  those  of
            clinical colleagues.

       iii) Failure to make findings.

            Dr Ghosh had prepared two detailed psychiatric reports but  the
            determination contains no clear conclusions as to a) whether it
            accepts that the Appellant  is  in  fact  suffering  from  Post
            Traumatic Stress Syndrome with associated psychotic features or
            b) if she is how that might have come about.

            Counsel had made detailed  submissions  on  the  likelihood  of
            appropriate  psychiatric  treatment  being  available  to  this
            Appellant in Nigeria, and had placed reliance on Paposhvilli  v
            Belgium. Even if  the  Appellant's  account  was  rejected,  it
            remained incumbent on the Tribunal to  assess  the  psychiatric
            evidence in the context of Articles 3 and 8 ECHR.

    Discussion and Findings

 7. I need not set out the submissions made before me in any  great  detail
    since the parties were in agreement that grounds (i) and (ii) were made
    out, and that they established material error of law.

 8. As to the decision not to call the  Appellant  that  was  of  course  a
    matter for her, and  her  legal  team.  There  is  no  obligation  upon
    appellants to give oral evidence.  Where  however  the  Respondent  has
    raised issues that require clarification, or questions that need to  be
    answered, a party who  declines  to  testify  cannot  complain  if  the
    Respondent's case is preferred over her own.  Ms Wilkins accepts  those
    basic propositions.

 9. What she has objected to here is that in drawing the negative inference
    that it has, the Tribunal has apparently  overlooked  the  explanations
    offered as to why the Appellant would not be called. Although Dr  Ghosh
    had found the Appellant fit to give evidence in the sense that she  had
    capacity to do so, it was the position  of  the  Appellant's  solicitor
    that she had  been  unable  to  take  sensible  instructions  from  the
    Appellant because the Appellant simply became too distressed  to  speak
    when asked to think about  material  parts  of  her  account.  She  had
    briefed Ms  Wilkins  to  that  effect.  Although  Ms  Wilkins  candidly
    acknowledged that she could not recall exactly what she might have said
    to the Tribunal, she was able to produce her speaking note (in the form
    of notes to her own  skeleton  argument)  which  expressly  raises  the
    solicitor's concerns.  For his part Mr Diwnycz accepted that  it  would
    be most unlikely that counsel would not have explained the  reason  why
    her lay client was not  being  called.  He  acknowledged  that  Broudie
    Jackson Canter had on the 10th April 2017 (some three months  prior  to
    the hearing) written to the First-tier Tribunal to advise it  that  the
    Appellant would not be giving evidence, and why.  I note from the court
    file that this had also been an issue raised at the  CMR  in  September
    2016, and in another letter from Broudie Jackson Canter dated  the  7th
    April 2017 the Tribunal was advised that they had been unable  to  take
    instructions  due  to  the  Appellant's  "deteriorating  mental  health
    condition".

10. The second ground relates to the approach taken to the evidence  of  Dr
    Ghosh. The concern quite properly raised by the First-tier Tribunal  is
    that where clinicians make a diagnosis simply on the basis of that they
    have been told, such a diagnosis will be, absent other factors, of very
    limited value to a Tribunal charged with making an  overall  evaluation
    of credibility.   As a matter of logic more weight will be attached  to
    such a diagnosis if it based on the doctor's own clinical  observations
    or those of other medical professionals.  Again,  Ms  Wilkins  accepted
    those propositions to be uncontroversial.

11. She submitted that in this particular case, however, it was clear  from
    the two reports of  Dr  Ghosh,  and  indeed  the  NHS  notes  that  had
    accompanied them, that Dr Ghosh had not confined her analysis  to  what
    she had been told by the Appellant.  Dr Ghosh had expressly set out her
    methodology at the beginning of the report and had stated in terms that
    she based her diagnosis not only on (self-reported)  symptoms,  but  on
    (clinically observable) "signs" and the  Appellant's  medical  history.
    She had then  throughout  her  report  referred  to  such  "signs"  and
    corroboration from  the  Appellant's  interaction  with  mental  health
    services.  For instance, Dr Ghosh records at page 3 of her first report
    how  the  Appellant  "became  very  distressed"   when   relating   her
    trafficking experience, and [at page 4] how questions  that  upset  her
    resulted in her "hyperventilating" and becoming "virtually  mute".   In
    her second report Dr Ghosh again states that she observed the Appellant
    becoming extremely distressed  and  how  this  has  also  been  "stated
    elsewhere": I understood this to be a reference to the  appended  notes
    of the Appellant's assessment  by  Mersey  Care  NHS  Foundation  Trust
    wherein the notes of several practitioners have been collated. Relevant
    observations taken into account by Dr Ghosh included  the  evidence  of
    Jackie Jones, a Band 6 Mental Health Practitioner, who states  that  on
    one occasion the Appellant "immediately tensed up visibly" when a  male
    interpreter entered the room, and that when he sat down  she  initially
    pushed her chair back into the corner. Ms Jones also records  that  the
    Appellant   has   appeared   "objectively   distressed/agitated"    and
    "unsettled" on various occasions when they have met.

12. The First-tier Tribunal found that the weight  to  be  attached  to  Dr
    Ghosh's reports was diminished because  she  had  based  her  diagnosis
    exclusively on what she had been told, and/or because  Ms  Wilkins  had
    failed to demonstrate otherwise.    As  I  think  the  paragraph  above
    illustrates, the Tribunal erred as a matter of  fact  if  it  concluded
    that this had been the methodology adopted by  Dr  Ghosh.   Mr  Diwnycz
    accepted that in applying so literal an interpretation  of  HE  (DRC  -
    credibility  and  psychiatric  reports)  DRC  [2004]  UKIAT  00321  the
    Tribunal - no doubt inadvertently - did act unfairly.  The  point  made
    in that case is that reports based entirely on  self-reporting  are  of
    very little value as far as credibility assessments are  concerned  and
    for that reason representatives  should  be  expected  to  be  able  to
    identify, when asked, what part of the report the Tribunal  can  safely
    place significant weight upon.   In this case Counsel did not do so (or
    at least did not do so to  the  Tribunal's  satisfaction)  because  she
    regarded it as evident from the face of the report.

13. Given the position of the Secretary of State for the Home Department on
    grounds (i) and (ii) I need not address ground (iii) which is concerned
    with the application of Paposhvili. As it happens on the morning of the
    hearing the decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  AM  (Zimbabwe)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA  Civ  64  became
    available.  The  setting  aside  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the remittal of this  matter  will  give  the  parties  an
    opportunity to consider  the  effect  of  that  judgement  on  how  the
    Appellant's representatives choose to now put her case.

    Decisions

14. The making of the First-tier Tribunal decision  involved  an  error  in
    approach such that the decision is set aside.

15. The matter will be remade following a de novo hearing in the First-tier
    Tribunal.
