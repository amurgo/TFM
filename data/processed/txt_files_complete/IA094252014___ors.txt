                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I shall  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellants are all citizens of India. The first appellant was  born
    on 12th March 1973; his wife, the second appellant,  was  born  on  1st
    February 1979; his children, the third, fourth  and  fifth  appellants,
    were born on 11th September 2001, the 28th June  2003  and  23rd  March
    2011. The first appellant applied for leave as a domestic  worker,  and
    the other appellants applied as his dependents. The  applications  were
    refused on 6th February 2014.  They appealed  on  13th  February  2014.
    These  appeals  were  allowed  under  the  Immigration   Rules   in   a
    determination of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Buckwell  promulgated
    on 22nd September 2014.

 3. On 20th October 2014 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Cheales  found
    that there was an arguable  error  of  law  because  accommodation  and
    finance had been put in issue in the refusal letter but this issue  was
    not addressed in the determination of Judge Buckwell.

 4. The matter came before me to determine whether the First-tier  Tribunal
    had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

 5. Mr Bramble relied upon the grounds of appeal.  The  appellants  had  to
    show  that  there  was  adequate  maintenance  and   accommodation   in
    accordance  with  paragraph  159EA(v)  with  reference   to   paragraph
    159A(vii) of the Immigration Rules. Judge Buckwell had  erred  material
    in law as he had failed to consider or make findings as to whether  the
    appellants could fulfil this requirement.

 6. Mr Earnest said that Judge Buckwell could be  seen  to  have  addressed
    this requirement as he referred to the bank  statements  of  the  first
    appellant at paragraph 16 of his determination, and the amount for  the
    first appellant's earnings were given on the application form.

 7. Mr Bramble submitted that paragraph  16  of  the  determination  simply
    addressed whether the first appellant had been continuously employed as
    a domestic worker by reference to the bank  statements.  It  was  clear
    that the issue of maintenance and accommodation had been put  in  issue
    by the respondent (see paragraph 2 of the determination)  and  was  not
    dealt with by the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions - Error of Law

 8. I informed the parties that I found Judge Buckwell had erred in law for
    the reasons set out in the Secretary of State's grounds. Judge Buckwell
    had identified that maintenance and  accommodation  were  in  issue  at
    paragraph 2 of his determination but failed to deal  with  this  issue,
    which amounted to an error of law as he had  entirely  failed  to  deal
    with a material issue when allowing the appeal. As Mr Bramble submitted
    the reference to bank statements at paragraph 16  was  in  relation  to
    their showing that the appellant could satisfy  the  requirement  under
    the Immigration Rules to have been continuously employed as a  domestic
    worker.

 9. I set aside the decision of Judge Buckwell but  preserved  all  of  his
    findings on other matters as there was no contention by  the  Secretary
    of State that they had been made improperly. It remained simply to  re-
    make the appeal  by  making  findings  on  the  issue  of  whether  the
    appellant could accommodation and maintain himself and  his  dependents
    adequately, without recourse to public funds, and therefore whether the
    appellants could show  compliance  with  all  of  the  requirements  at
    paragraph 159EA of the Immigration Rules.

Re-making - Conclusions

10. Both parties were happy for the error to be instantly  remade.  It  was
    agreed that  the  only  income  the  family  had  was  from  the  first
    appellant's wages and that this was accurate set  out  at  5.3  of  the
    FLR(O) application form, and that the rent the family paid was also set
    out accurately at  5.2 of the application form.

11. It was agreed that the measure of adequacy is the amount the  appellant
    and his family would receive if on income support, in  accordance  with
    KA & Others (adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 65.

12. At the hearing I provided figures as to the amount  the  appellant  and
    his family would receive per week on income support. This was an amount
    of �326.81 per week (�112.55 for the couple, �65.62 for each child (3),
    and �17.40 family premium), which  was  equivalent  of  a  monthly  net
    salary of �1416. As the appellant's salary, the only family income, was
    just �850 and as from this he had to pay �350  in  rent,  leaving  just
    �500 a month to maintain the family, it was clear that  the  appellants
    could not show adequate maintenance.

13. I therefore informed the parties that I  would  therefore  re-make  the
    appeal dismissing it under the Immigration Rules as it was  clear  that
    the maintenance and accommodation requirement could not be met.

14. The appeal under Article 8 ECHR had been withdrawn  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and there was no request to reinstate it.

Decision

   1. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

   2. The decision, but not the findings, of the First-tier Tribunal is  set
      aside.

   3. The appeal is remade dismissing it under the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction is made.
