                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

1.   The appellant is a Philippine national born  on  21  March  1986.   She
    entered the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student with a visa valid until 11
    May 2011 on 20 September 2009.  That visa was subject to two subsequent
    extension applications which were both rejected.   On  5  January  2012
    further leave to  remain  was  refused.   Thereafter,  presumably,  the
    appellant remained here illegally.  However, in January 2015 she became
    engaged to Jose Javier Marti Lorite, the sponsor,  a  Spanish  national
    whom she married on 21 February 2015.  Consequently,  on  her  marriage
    the appellant applied for a residence card on 21 February 2015.  In her
    application, the appellant supplied an address ([ ] Seedly  (sic)  Park
    Road, Salford) but correspondence to that address was  returned  marked
    "undelivered".   On  20  April  2015,  her  EEA  sponsor  advised   the
    respondent that he believed the appellant had only married him to get a
    residence card.  He confirmed this in writing on 21 April  2015.   This
    led the Home Office to conclude that the marriage to the appellant, who
    had failed to provide the respondent with a valid postal  address,  was
    "one of convenience".  Nevertheless, the appellant sent a letter  under
    the Pre-action Protocol for Judicial Review Claims on 8 September  2015
    challenging the respondent's delay in dealing with the application  for
    a residence card.  By this point the appellant confirmed  her  address.
    However, the respondent refused the application for a residence card.

2.   The appellant appealed the refusal to  grant  a  residence  card  by  a
    notice of appeal received on 29 September 2015.  The appeal  was  heard
    by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  I.  Ross  (the  Immigration  Judge)  who
    subsequently announced his decision to dismiss the  appellant's  appeal
    against the respondent's refusal of a  residence  card  on  1 December
    2016.

3.   On 8 December 2016,  the  appellant  sought  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal from the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT).   The
    grounds state that the Immigration Judge had followed the "wrong  legal
    test", pointing out that the cases referred to  of  Papajorgji  and  IS
    (Serbia) had been overruled by a decision of the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Agho [2015] EWCA Civ 1198 and Rosa [2016] EWCA  Civ  14.   It  was  not
    correct  for  there  to  be  merely  reasonable  suspicion  as  to  the
    authenticity  of  the  appellant's  marriage  to  the   sponsor.    The
    respondent bore the "full burden of showing  a  sham  marriage  to  the
    civil standard (higher than a 'reasonable suspicion')".  The  appellant
    emphasised in his grounds that the Immigration Judge had put the burden
    on the appellant, rather than the other way around.  Additionally,  the
    Immigration Judge made a serious error where he stated that  there  was
    no  "independent"  evidence  of  cohabitation.   There  was   "material
    evidence" which he had failed to consider.   Thirdly,  the  Immigration
    Judge made adverse credibility findings  that  the  appellant  and  her
    husband were only together for five months before marrying and  only  a
    month afterwards they  split.   The  length  of  the  relationship  can
    "never" by itself be a ground  for  adverse  findings.   If  the  judge
    wishes to make an adverse finding he  needs  to  explain  why  a  short
    relationship is suspicious.  The explanation for the early  breakup  of
    this  relationship  related  to  alleged  domestic  violence  and   the
    Immigration Judge should have accepted that explanation.  Finally,  the
    Immigration Judge was criticised for not availing the  appellant  of  a
    sufficient opportunity to  explain  the  appellant's  theory  that  the
    letter written by the sponsor in April 2015 was written out  of  spite.
    The  Immigration  Judge  should  not  have  denied  the  appellant  the
    opportunity to explain her theory.  This was a procedural  error  which
    rendered the proceedings unfair.  Finally, the Immigration Judge failed
    to make findings on the version of the P60 and pay  slips  the  sponsor
    had produced and the fact that the sponsor had written a letter to  the
    respondent after his letter  to  the  Home  Office.   This  would  have
    contradicted the sponsor's adverse comments to the  respondent  and  it
    might have led the Immigration Judge  to  give  less  weight  to  those
    comments.

The Upper Tribunal Proceedings

4.   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ransley gave permission to appeal  the
    decision of the FtT on 7 June 2017 because he found  that  all  grounds
    were at least arguable.  Standard directions were  sent  out  notifying
    the parties if further evidence needed to  be  admitted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal an application had to be made under Rule 15(2A) indicating the
    nature of that evidence  and  explaining  why  it  was  desired  to  be
    submitted with an explanation as to why it had not been admitted before
    the FtT.

5.   At the hearing of the appeal Mr Krushner  said  the  Immigration  Judge
    had misinterpreted the Papajorgji  case.   The  Immigration  Judge  had
    erred in appearing to require the appellant  to  prove  anything.   The
    burden rested on the Secretary of State.  Additionally, the  judge  was
    wrong to find no evidence of cohabitation, there were  bank  statements
    to  show  the  couple  lived  at  the  same  address.   These  provided
    independent evidence to back up the  appellant's  case.   Although  the
    couple had spilt soon after their  marriage,  this  did  not  harm  the
    appellant's credibility given the explanation she provided.  There were
    wedding photographs and other documents to  corroborate  the  marriage.
    The Immigration Judge had ignored material  evidence  which  he  should
    have considered.   Furthermore,  refused  to  hear  evidence  from  the
    appellant which would have provided her explanation for  the  sponsor's
    letter to the respondent.

6.   By way of reply, Mr Avery pointed out that the  Immigration  Judge  had
    applied the correct burden and  standard  of  proof,  referring  me  to
    paragraph 9 of the  decision.   He  said  there  were  several  serious
    credibility issues about this marriage, including its  shortness.   The
    appellant had  a  number  of  opportunities  to  produce  corroborating
    evidence, and although this was not a strict requirement, such evidence
    might have gone some way to establishing that the relationship was  not
    one of convenience.  I was then referred to the Court of  Session  case
    of XA [2016] CSIH 51 and to paragraph 20 thereof.  A judge  deciding  a
    case such as this one had to decide whether it is "more  probable  than
    not that the marriage is one  of  convenience  'in  the  light  of  the
    totality of the information', the court had".  It  was  submitted  that
    very little evidence was produced to support the appellant's  case  and
    the refusal letter was relied on in full.  Evidence in the form of bank
    statements the limited number of bank statements available which showed
    the appellant and the sponsor  living  at  the  same  address  was  not
    pertinent. When fully considered, it would not have made any difference
    to the outcome.  Mr Avery therefore sought to uphold the decision.

7.   Mr Krushner replied to the effect that even if the evidence  which  the
    judge ignored (i.e. the bank statements showing the appellant  and  the
    sponsor were living at the same address) was  not  crucial,  it  should
    have been considered by  the  judge  and  the  fact  that  it  was  not
    considered meant the judge's overall conclusion  was  undermined.  That
    evidence may have been material.  There were also  wedding  photographs
    which the judge appears to have taken no  account  of.   The  appellant
    ought to have been allowed to give evidence as to the  explanation  her
    husband had supplied to her (i.e. hearsay evidence) as to  why  he  had
    written to the Home Office in the terms he had.  Towards the conclusion
    of Mr Krushner's submissions  he  introduced  some  new  evidence.   He
    accepted this has not been adduced in accordance  with  directions.  Mr
    Avery, fairly, took no objection to it.  It consists of a  new  witness
    statement from a Mr Bezon.  I suggested that it  would  be  helpful  to
    hear the  appellant's  explanation  of  the  sponsor's  letter  to  the
    respondent as I would then be able to form a view as to the merits  of
    the appellant's submission  that  the  judge  had  failed  to  consider
    material evidence. That may well amount to a  material  error  of  law.
    Neither party objected to this course.

8.   The appellant was then asked to  adopt  both  her  witness  statements.
    She was also asked some supplementary questions, the answers to which I
    noted in the Tribunal file.   The  appellant  said  that  she  and  the
    sponsor were hoping to form a new life in the UK but the marriage broke
    down quickly.  One  of  the  causes  of  the  breakdown  was  that  the
    sponsor's insistence that the couple go  to  live  in  Manchester.   In
    addition, the sponsor had a drinking habit and took cannabis.  He would
    drink between seven and ten pints at a time.  She said  that  following
    the letter to the respondent she had met up with the sponsor.  He  said
    how sorry he was to have provided information to the Home Office.   The
    appellant said that she no longer loved her husband.  She  believed  at
    the time he wrote the letter he did it out of anger and frustration  of
    their relationship breaking up to "get back at her".

9.   Mr Avery briefly cross-examined the appellant.  She  said  in  response
    to his questions that she came to the UK initially for  study  but  the
    course had closed.  Her parents had sponsored her to  do  that  course.
    She was asked how she was financing herself at the time of the date  of
    the hearing.  The appellant said that she was working twenty hours  per
    week.  The appellant was asked why she had not left  the  UK  when  she
    concluded her studies and she said that she wanted to stay in  the  UK.
    The appellant was asked why she had  not  wanted  to  return  home  and
    continue in her studies there.  She said that she would earn more money
    in the UK, she wanted to stay  here  and  although  she  had  initially
    wanted to go back she realised that this was economically  contrary  to
    her interests.

10.  There was no re-examination.

11.  Mr Avery submitted that the appellant's motivation in  applying  for  a
    residence permit was a desire to stay in the UK  and  not  to  form  or
    continue a relationship with an EEA national. This had always been here
    intention. It appears the appellant had entered a sham marriage  solely
    for facilitating her immigration into the UK.

12.  Mr Krushner submitted that the appellant had supplied all the  evidence
    that she could reasonably have been expected to provide.  Although this
    was  limited,  given  the  shortness  of  the  relationship  this   was
    unsurprising.  I was asked to consider photographs, bank statements and
    other documents not considered by the Immigration Judge and  find  that
    they may have made a material difference to the outcome of  the  appeal
    to the FTT.  The appellant had demonstrated  that  she  has  entered  a
    genuine relationship but it had quickly "gone wrong" and this was not a
    sham.  The legal burden had not been discharged by the respondent.   It
    was not enough to have mere suspicion.

13.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my  decision  which  I  will  give
    after the following discussion.

Discussion

14.  The legal principles are set out  in  the  Scottish  case  of  Sadavska
    (also known as XA) [2016] CSIH 51 where the  Lord  President  gave  the
    opinion that following Papajorgji [2012] UKUT 38 the question before  a
    Tribunal would be: whether it  is  more  probable  than  not  that  the
    marriage is one of convenience "in the light of  the  totality  of  the
    information"?  As Mr Krushner pointed out,  the  burden  rests  on  the
    respondent.   The  standard  of  proof  is  that  of   a   balance   of
    probabilities.  Therefore, it was wrong for the  Immigration  Judge  in
    the final  sentence  of  paragraph  9  to  suggest  that  there  is  an
    evidential burden on an appellant to address  the  evidence  justifying
    the reasonable suspicion that the marriage has been  entered  into  for
    the predominant purpose of securing residence rights.  As  Mr  Krushner
    explained, the law has moved on since Papajorgji.  In  particular,  the
    law is correctly summarised in his grounds of appeal at paragraph 1.  I
    refer to the cases of Agho [2015] EWCA Civ 1198 and  Rosa  [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 14 also referred to there.

15.  The first issue therefore is whether the omission  to  refer  to  those
    cases and to set out the burden and standard of  proof  in  the  manner
    described by the Lord President amounts to a material error of law?

16.  If one removes the last sentence of paragraph 9 of  the  decision,  the
    Immigration Judge's description of the burden and standard of proof  is
    correct.  I am  satisfied  that  he  had  in  mind  the  need  for  the
    respondent to bear the burden of showing that the marriage was  one  of
    convenience in the light of all the circumstances of the case.

17.  The second identified error on which permission  to  appeal  was  given
    relates to  the  Immigration  Judge's  assertion  that  there  was  "no
    independent evidence" that the appellant ever lived with her husband in
    Manchester.  The Immigration Judge asserted that there was a  "complete
    lack of any independent evidence" that the appellant  ever  lived  with
    the sponsor in Manchester.  It is pointed out that in fact  there  were
    "bank statements" and "letters" which supported their  cohabitation  at
    an address known as [ ] Seedley Park Road,  Salford.   Strictly,  there
    was some evidence therefore and the Immigration Judge's  statement  was
    incorrect.  In addition, there was evidence relating to  the  sponsor's
    employment, for example, a letter from Elliott Baxter &  Company.  That
    company claims to have employed the sponsor with effect from Monday  16
    February 2015 as a forklift truck driver.  Dave Seddon,  the  warehouse
    manager, purported to sign an appropriate declaration in support of the
    application.  There were also two bank statements, one for  each  party
    to the marriage.  The first is by the sponsor, which  has  a  different
    spelling of the word Seedley than that given by the  appellant  and  it
    records a deposit of 0.50  pence  on  2  February  2015  at  Manchester
    Trafford.  The statement was  printed  on  19  February  2015,  shortly
    before the application.  There is also a Barclays' statement purporting
    to relate to an account in the appellant's name at  the  same  address.
    That records transactions  between  2  February  and  23  February  and
    records money out of � 7.50 and money in of  �60.   Those  single  bank
    statements with no transaction history raise more questions  than  they
    answer. They do not, in my  view,  help  to  establish  any  period  of
    cohabitation.   Whilst  it  might  not  have  been  accurate  for   the
    Immigration Judge to say there was "a complete lack of any  independent
    evidence", it would have been accurate to say that there was a lack  of
    convincing evidence given that two documents referred to  could  easily
    have been generated, as they appear to have been, very  shortly  before
    the application solely for the purposes of  showing  that  the  parties
    lived at the same address but without any  transaction  history  behind
    them.  No explanation was given as to  how  either  party  came  to  be
    living in the Manchester area.

18.  I am informed that there were also utility bills.  These have not  been
    produced and it is not entirely clear they  were  produced  before  the
    FtT.  There appears to be no  reference  to  them  in  the  Immigration
    Judge's summary of the evidence.

19.  Turning to the third ground of appeal on which permission was  granted,
    the appellant claims that she left "the  house  due  to  arguments  and
    aggression  from  the  sponsor"  and  she  goes  on  to  criticise  the
    Immigration Judge for giving no reason for rejecting that  explanation.
    I can find no reference to an allegation of actual violence towards the
    appellant in the summary of the evidence  and  submissions  before  the
    FtT.  In her form IAFT5, box 6 the appellant asserts that the  marriage
    broke up "because I wanted us to go to London together and he was using
    drugs after we cohabited/married".  The appellant  goes  on  to  assert
    that the sponsor became bitter and alleged the marriage was sham  as  a
    form of "revenge".  Nowhere does it allege there was actual  aggression
    and there is no adequate explanation anywhere of why the sponsor  would
    go to the trouble  of  contacting  the  Home  Office  and  subsequently
    backing it up with a letter in April 2015.  If  the  appellant  alleged
    actual violence or threats of violence  there  should  have  been  some
    evidence of this and no doubt she would have sought protection  by  way
    of an injunction had such violence been threatened.

20.  Having heard submissions from both representatives it  was  clear  that
    the Immigration Judge's conduct of the hearing was less than  ideal  in
    that he prevented the appellant giving  any  evidence  to  support  her
    assertion as to the sponsor's motivation in writing the letter  to  the
    Home Office.  However, I am satisfied the Immigration Judge  was  aware
    of the appellant's case including her assertion that  her  husband  had
    alleged that they had entered a sham marriage as  a  form  of  revenge.
    Unfortunately,  for  the  appellant,  they  constitute  no  more   than
    assertions. The appellant's own interpretation  of  events  of  hearsay
    evidence of conversations with her husband was  unlikely  to  be  given
    significant weight.  The Immigration Judge understood the allegation by
    the appellant that the sponsor had made a representation  to  the  Home
    Office "out of revenge for her leaving him". However, he  rejected  it.
    Therefore, the procedural irregularity in not allowing an appellant  to
    give evidence on every potentially material point, does not  appear  to
    have affected the outcome of the case.

21.   The  appellant's  next  point  was  that  the  sponsor  had   supplied
    additional evidence, following his contact with the Home Office,  which
    undermined  his  assertions  regarding  his   relationship   with   the
    appellant.

22.  The documents that I understand to be relied  on  in  support  of  this
    submission are far from compelling.  Pay slips have been  produced  for
    the sponsor dating from 6 February 2015 and 13 February  2015.   It  is
    not clear how that period  of  employment  relates  to  the  period  of
    employment that began on 16 February 2015 with Elliott Baxter.  Elliott
    Baxter in any event is a company based in Feltham,  Middlesex.  It  may
    have a branch in the Salford area, although this is not  explained.   I
    do not consider that these documents were likely to alter  the  overall
    conclusion that this was a sham marriage.

Conclusions

23.  The appellant was  entitled  upon  marrying  an  EEA  national  to  the
    benefit of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
    (the 2006 Regulations).  The appellant was entitled to  be  treated  as
    the  family  member  of  another  person  (her  spouse)  by  virtue  of
    Regulation 7 of those Regulations.  Furthermore, by  Regulation  16  of
    the  2006  Regulations  the  respondent  was  required   to   issue   a
    registration certificate to a qualifying person on being produced  with
    a valid identity card or passport for the EEA state and proof that  the
    person qualifies.  The respondent must  then  issue  a  residence  card
    which subsequently translates into  a  permanent  right  of  residence.
    However, Regulation 2 of the 2006 Regulations states  that  a  "spouse"
    does not include a party to a marriage of convenience.

24.  I am satisfied that the  respondent  produced  sufficient  evidence  to
    show that the marriage to the sponsor was one of convenience in that it
    was solely for the purposes of remaining in the  United  Kingdom.   The
    appellant's oral evidence before the Upper Tribunal made it clear  that
    after the appellant was forced to abandon her studies  in  the  UK  she
    desired to stay here at all costs.  She wished to improve her  economic
    prospects  by  remaining  in  the  UK.   This  evidence  supports   the
    respondent's original conclusion and the FtT's dismissal of her appeal.
    It seems unlikely that  she  ever  intended  to  embark  on  a  serious
    relationship of marriage with the sponsor.

25.  The appellant's evidence was inadequate.   For  example,  she  did  not
    produce any witness statement or letter in support from any person  who
    attended  the  wedding  ceremony  or  a  neighbour  to  confirm   their
    cohabitation.  Although the appellant referred in her application  form
    (in box 5.14) to having regular contact with the sponsor  by  telephone
    and text, she produced no evidence of either  of  these  communications
    having place.  It is also noteworthy that when she  gave  the  date  of
    their wedding in the letter in support (at K1-K2  of  the  respondent's
    bundle) she was unable to give the correct  date -  the  date  on  the
    certificate being 21 February, not 22nd.  The fact that she was  unable
    to spell the name of the address that she lived at in the same  way  on
    all the documents is  also  suspicious.  Furthermore,  the  appellant's
    application to the respondent was  only  48  hours  after  the  wedding
    service. This  evidence  was  also  such  as  to  make  the  respondent
    suspicious.  The suspicions were reinforced by the sponsor  writing  in
    April 2015 to the effect that he regarded it himself as a  marriage  of
    convenience.  Additional factors which were relevant included the  fact
    that the appellant had not contacted the respondent  since  April  2015
    despite attempts by the respondent  to  get  in  touch  with  her.   It
    appears that correspondence to the address she had given were  returned
    "undelivered".

26.  The conduct of the hearing was less than ideal analysis and  the  legal
    analysis left something to be desired. However,  it  appears  that  the
    Immigration Judge's overall conclusions were justified on the evidence.
     Although it was not accurate to say there was  a  "complete  lack"  of
    evidence of cohabitation there were highly suspicious circumstances  in
    this case.  Having heard all the evidence the Immigration Judge reached
    a conclusion which he  was  entitled  to  come  to  on  that  evidence.
    Therefore, the Upper Tribunal will  not  interfere  with  the  decision
    because errors of law identified were not material.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain any material  error
of law and that decision stands.  Accordingly, the respondent's decision  to
refuse a residence card also stands.

There is no anonymity direction in this case.
