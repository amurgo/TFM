Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr MacKensie, Counsel, instructed by Kesar & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Shiliday (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Democratic  Republic  of  Congo.  The
    appellant claimed asylum on July 31, 2013 but in a refusal letter dated
    August 8, 2014  a  decision  was  taken  to  refuse  her  asylum  under
    paragraph 336 HC 395. At the same time  the  respondent  exercised  her
    discretion to grant the appellant limited leave to enter or  remain  in
    the United Kingdom outside of the Immigration Rules in accordance  with
    published Home Office Asylum Policy Instruction on Discretionary Leave.
    The  appellant  appealed  under  section  83(2)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on August 22, 2014. .

 2. The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Vaudin
    d'Imecourt (hereinafter referred to as the  "FtTJ")  on  September  29,
    2014 and in a decision promulgated on November 18,  2014  he  dismissed
    the appeal for asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights.

 3. The appellant lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  December  2,  2014.  She
    submitted the FtTJ erred by refusing her  appeal.  In  particular,  she
    submitted the FtTJ had erred:

      a. In her approach to credibility by failing to apply the  benefit  of
         the doubt and make allowances for the appellant's age.
      b. Making findings that ignored the objective evidence on languages.
      c. Making adverse findings against the appellant with regard to having
         contact with her family in circumstances where the  respondent  had
         granted her Discretionary leave on basis she had no  family  to  be
         returned to.


 4. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal White granted permission to appeal  on
    December 12, 2014 finding there were arguable errors in law because:

      a. The respondent accepted the appellant was an unaccompanied minor.
      b. The FtTJ arguably failed  in  assessing  her  credibility  to  give
         adequate consideration to the fact she  was  a  minor  and  instead
         finding she was a "mature, intelligent young woman".
      c. The FtTJ arguably failed to take into account the respondent's duty
         to trace family.


 5. The appellant was not in attendance in court but was represented as set
    out above.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 6. Mr MacKensie adopted the grounds and submitted as follows:

      a. He referred me  to  paragraphs  [38]  to  [42]  of  AA  (unattended
         children) Afghanistan CG [2012] 00016 (IAC) for the approach to  be
         taken when assessing the credibility of a minor and how  the  court
         applied those principles to the facts of  that  case  at  paragraph
         [110].
      b. He submitted the FtTJ had to make allowances for  the  child's  age
         and the difficulties the child may have due to lack  of  knowledge,
         maturity and experience and the FtTJ must not impose his own  views
         of what was plausible. He  submitted  the  FtTJ  erred  because  he
         failed to do this and found that she was an astute young lady.
      c. He  further  submitted  that  the  appellant  was  in  a  catch  22
         situation. If she gave inconsistent evidence  then  this  would  be
         held against her but by being consistent the FtTJ found her  to  be
         an astute, intelligent young woman.
      d. The FtTJ erred by finding she was told what to say  but  was  never
         asked if that was the case.
      e. The FtTJ  claimed  to  have  considered  her  account  against  the
         background evidence but he had not. In paragraph [39]  he  made  an
         adverse finding about the appellant stating she  would  have  known
         what the M23 men were saying when  in  fact  there  are  over  four
         hundred languages spoken in the DRC.
      f. The FtTJ held it against the appellant that she remembered a day in
         history that had nothing to do with her family but  he  also  found
         she was an astute young girl. These two findings are inconsistent.
      g. The FtTJ  wrongly  found  her  claim  about  her  father  remaining
         incredible because he failed to have regard to her age and the fact
         she may not know why her father remained in the house.
      h.  The  FtTJ  wrongly  rejected  her  departure  explanation  to   be
         fabricated.
      i. The FtTJ wrongly rejected her claim that it  was  pure  coincidence
         that she ended up in the same as country as her aunt as this failed
         to failed to take into account the appellant did not  remember  the
         priest or church who helped her until prompted to by the FtTJ.
      j. The respondent granted her Discretionary Leave and should not  have
         found she would be able to contact family members in the DRC.


 7. Mr Shiliday adopted the Rule 24 response dated December  31,  2014.  He
    submitted that Mr MacKensie's submissions amounted to nothing more than
    a mere disagreement. The FtTJ may have made some  contentious  findings
    but those findings were open to him on the evidence. In particular,  he
    submitted:


      a. The FtTJ erred with regard to the date the M23 group invaded Angola
         as it was November 20, 2013 and not 2012 but this was  not  a  date
         that meant anything to the appellant. Whilst Mr  Shiliday  did  not
         necessary agree with his finding it was something that was open  to
         him in light of the findings he made about the father.


      b. Whilst it was preferable to put the issue  about  language  to  the
         appellant this was not an argument raised by the respondent and  it
         would  have  been  inappropriate  for  the  FtTJ  to  question  the
         appellant about it. The FtTJ was entitled to ask her questions  but
         he could not put an alternative case to that advanced by the  FtTJ.
         He came to a conclusion on the evidence before him that was open to
         him.


      c. The FtTJ  made  it  clear  in  his  determination  particularly  in
         paragraph [36] when he commenced his findings that he had regard to
         the appellant's age both when she came to the United Kingdom and at
         the date of hearing. He had the benefit of hearing and  seeing  her
         give evidence and he  was  entitled  to  make  findings  about  her
         evidence. His conclusion in paragraph [41] that she was a  "mature,
         intelligent young woman" was open to him and was  not  contrary  to
         the advice given in AA.


      d. The FtTJ did not believe the appellant's account and concluded  she
         had learnt an account to give. In the alternative he concluded that
         it lacked  credibility  that  the  appellant's  father  would  have
         remained. The fact it was the appellant giving  this  evidence  did
         not alter the fact he did not accept the claim.  He  assessed  what
         she had to say and found that if what had been claimed had happened
         the appellant's father would not have returned to the  house.  This
         was open to him.


      e. Although Judge of the First-tier White referred to the respondent's
         failure to trace the appellant's family this had not  been  pursued
         today. The appellant's claim had been her family were killed as she
         heard two shots and fled. The respondent  could  not  trace  family
         that she claimed had been killed. The FtTJ  concluded  her  account
         was a fabrication and was entitled to question why she had made  no
         attempt  to  find  her  family.  The  fact  she  had  been  granted
         Discretionary Leave  was  not  an  acceptance  of  her  claim.  The
         respondent's policy was to grant unaccompanied minors Discretionary
         leave until they were 17 ï¿½ years old.


      f. There was no error in law.


 8. Mr MacKensie reminded me that there were two issues I had to  consider.
    Was the decision rational and was the decision fair. He  submitted  the
    FtTJ erred on both fronts and the decision  should  be  set  aside  and
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal.

 9. I reserved my decision and if there was an error in law I  would  remit
    the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

10. The FtTJ spent a considerable amount of time  preparing  this  decision
    although it is arguable that thirty pages reciting the contents of  the
    appellant's two  interviews,  her  statement,  oral  evidence  and  the
    solicitor's covering letter is somewhat excessive especially  when  his
    conclusion in paragraph [37] was that she managed to remain consistent.
    The verbose opening of the determination set  the  background  for  the
    findings he made between pages 32 and 34 of the determination.

11. Mr MacKensie quite properly submitted this appeal was about whether the
    decision was rational and fair. He submitted:

      a. The decision was unfair because the  appellant  did  not  give  the
         appellant the benefit of the doubt in her evidence  and  failed  to
         put some of his adverse findings to her.
      b. The decision was not rational because he made  findings  that  were
         contrary to the evidence presented.


12. Mr MacKensie reminded me that the  Tribunal  in  AA  had  set  out  the
    approach to be taken when assessing the credibility of a child witness.
    Factors that should be taken into account include:


      a. The appellant's background
      b. Her gender
      c. Her age
      d. Her maturity
      e. Objective indications of risk as against the appellant's  state  of
         mind and understanding of the situation
      f. The benefit of the doubt should be applied more generously
      g. It may be necessary for an examiner to assume a greater  burden  of
         proof in child cases.


13. The appellant's original representative brought the decision of  AA  to
    the attention of the FtTJ and he invited the FtTJ to find the appellant
    a credible witness in light of that case.


14. Paragraphs [35] and [36] set the backdrop  to  his  assessment  of  the
    claim. The FtTJ made it clear that he considered the  relevant  country
    and background evidence  and  importantly  he  took  into  account  the
    appellant's age at interview and  hearing  and  he  went  onto  say  in
    paragraph [36] that he made allowance for her age and he  concluded  by
    saying-

         "... I have not lost sight  of  the  fact  that  the  appellant  is
         exactly that, a child, and I have made  every  allowance  for  that
         fact."

15. The FtTJ then proceeded to explain how the appellant gave her  evidence
    and commented that she gave evidence in  French,  which  he  understood
    fully, and his impression was she was a "very  astute  and  intelligent
    mature young woman who overall managed  to  remain  consistent  in  the
    account she had given throughout."


16.  Contrary  to  Mr  MacKensie's  submission  I  am  satisfied  the  FtTJ
    demonstrated through his thorough record of the proceedings that he had
    regard to the appellant's gender, age,  maturity  and  background.  The
    tribunal in AA also made clear that the benefit of the doubt should  be
    more in the appellant's favour with the respondent assuming  a  greater
    burden. In paragraph [39] of his decision the FtTJ made clear  that  he
    considered the appellant's account against the objective background.

17. The rationale of the FtTJ's findings was challenged and  in  particular
    on two premises:

      a. It was wrong for the FtTJ to conclude  the  appellant  should  have
         understood what the men from M23 and her father were discussing.


      b. The FtTJ was wrong to conclude that as there was no reason for  her
         to remember the date of November 20, 2012 that she must  have  been
         told this date.


18. The FtTJ had the opportunity to listen  to  all  her  evidence  and  to
    assess it. Mr MacKensie pointed out to me  that  there  are  over  four
    hundred languages spoken in the DRC and therefore it was  not  open  to
    the FtTJ to find she would have understood the conversation between her
    father and the men.  However,  his  assessment  of  that  evidence  was
    alongside other aspects of her evidence and having  considered  all  of
    the evidence he reached findings that clearly were open to him. She did
    not appear  to  suggest  her  father  spoke  a  language  she  did  not
    understand at any other time and consequently it was just  as  open  to
    the FtTJ to find she would have understood what was said as against she
    would not have understood. Similarly, the FtTJ was entitled  to  reject
    her claim her father decided to remain in the house after May 9,  2013.
    The fact the appellant is a child does not  mean  that  everything  she
    said was credible. The  FtTJ  had  to  assess  the  evidence  and  make
    findings and even after allowing for the "AA" factors he made  negative
    findings about her account. To say those  findings  were  not  open  is
    perverse as the logic of that submission is  that  everything  a  child
    asylum seeker says must be accepted unless there is clear  evidence  to
    disprove it.


19. The FtTJ found as implausible her claims of what happened. He  accepted
    she was consistent but being consistent does not necessarily  mean  the
    account is plausible. It is a catch 22 situation but it is a  situation
    that many asylum seekers face. If their account is inconsistent  it  is
    rejected and if it is consistent then it may not be what happened.  The
    FtTJ has to consider the evidence  carefully  even  more  so  when  the
    appellant is a child.

20. The FtTJ went onto consider her claims further in paragraphs  [40]  and
    [41] and rejected the claims for the reasons given. He  considered  how
    the appellant came to be in the United Kingdom and found  that  it  was
    more than a coincidence that she came to the very country where she had
    an  aunt  who  had  also  claimed   asylum   in   "strikingly   similar
    circumstances" and who also received support from the priest who  years
    later also helped the appellant and who passed  to  the  appellant  her
    mother's bible that just happened to contain the  aunt's  UK  telephone
    number.

21. The FtTJ carefully considered the evidence and made  findings  open  to
    him. The fact the appellant was a child was considered  but  ultimately
    the FtTJ found too many adverse findings that did not have anything  to
    do with her age or maturity but was simply to do with the fact  he  did
    not find the account at all credible. From the FtTJ's perspective  this
    was not a finely balanced decision, which should have resulted  in  the
    benefit of the doubt being in the appellant's favour.

22. Finally, it was argued that the  respondent's  decision  to  grant  the
    appellant Discretionary Leave was inconsistent with the suggestion  the
    appellant could have made enquiries about her family. The  granting  of
    Discretionary Leave is recognition she is an  unaccompanied  minor  who
    claimed she  had  no  family.  The  respondent's  policy  is  to  grant
    Discretionary Leave but this is governed by paragraphs 352ZE  to  352ZF
    of the Immigration Rules.  The  appellant  met  the  criteria  and  was
    granted leave accordingly.  The  respondent  rejected  the  appellant's
    claim and it was therefore open to the FtTJ to make the findings he did
    on possible contact with family although I am satisfied the appellant's
    claim was rejected because her account on what she  said  happened  was
    rejected.

23. I therefore find there has been  no  error  in  law  and  the  original
    decision shall stand.

Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not disclose  an  error  in
    law. I uphold the original decision.

25. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier but in view of the appellant's  age  I
    do make an anonymity order with all the  consequences  that  flow  from
    such a direction.
