                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Singh (Legal Representative)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, born December 16, 1998, May 5, 2004, February 2,  2003,
    June 16, 1997, October 6, 2009,  December  13,  2000,  March  2,  1956,
    November 17, 1999 and  March  6,  2001  respectively  are  citizens  of
    Somalia. They applied on September 28, 2012 for entry  clearance  under
    the Family Reunion policy as set out in paragraphs  352A  and  352D  HC
    395.

 2. Appellants (1), (4)-(6), (8) and (9) are the sponsor's  (Hawa  Mohammed
    Noor) natural children.  Appellants  (2)  and  (3)  are  the  sponsor's
    adopted children. Appellant (7) is the sponsor's spouse.

 3. On November 25, 2012 the respondent refused all of  their  applications
    because:

     a. The sponsor's husband had failed to demonstrate he was married to a
        person granted asylum or intended to live permanently together  and
        the marriage was subsisting as required by  paragraph  352A(i)  and
        (iv) HC 395.


     b.  The  remaining  appellants  had  not  established  they  were  the
        sponsor's children or were part of a  family  unit  of  the  person
        granted asylum as required by paragraph 352D(i) and (iv) HC 395.

 4. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  on  December  27,
    2012.

 5. On  December  20,  2013  Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Edwards
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ")  heard  their  appeals  and  in
    determination promulgated on January 2, 2014 he refused their  appeals.
    Although he accepted that paragraphs 320(3) and 320(7A) HC 395 did  not
    apply to family reunion appeals he nevertheless went onto dismiss their
    appeals because false documents had been used.

 6. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on  January  21,  2014  and  on
    February  6,  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Davidge  gave
    permission to appeal finding it was arguable  the  FtTJ  had  erred  by
    dismissing the appeals on the basis of false documents.

 7. The matter came before me on the above date.

 8. Mc McVeety conceded that the paragraphs 320(3) and 320(7A) HC  395  did
    not apply to these appeals. The FtTJ had  accepted  this  at  paragraph
    [26] of his determination. However, in paragraphs [27] to [29]  of  his
    findings he rejected the appeals because of the false  documents.  This
    was a clear error as he had accepted they could not be refused on  this
    basis. Correct passports and DNA evidence had  been  submitted  and  no
    issue had  been  taken  with  these  at  the  hearing.  The  appellants
    therefore must meet the Rules.

 9. I concurred with Mr McVeety's sensible approach and did not require  Mr
    Singh to address me.

10. I am satisfied the FtTJ was wrong  to  refuse  these  appeals  for  the
    reasons given in paragraphs [27] to  [29]  of  his  determination.  The
    appellants met the requirements of paragraphs  352A  and  352D  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

Decision

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did disclose an error in law. I
    set aside the original decisions and allow all of the appeals under the
    Immigration Rules.


12. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    such order was made in the First-tier and I see no reason to make  such
    an order now.

TO THE RESPONDENT

I do not make a fee award for the same reasons as previously given.
