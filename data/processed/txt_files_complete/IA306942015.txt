                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 13th April  1977.
     He appeals against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  taken  on  1st
    September 2015, to maintain the revocation of a  residence  card  under
    Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)   Regulations   2006   ("the
    regulations").

2.   The appellant claims to have entered the Republic of Ireland  in  2006,
    where he made an asylum claim  that  was  refused  in  2008.   He  then
    married an EEA national in Ireland in October 2007 and  they  moved  to
    the United Kingdom in August 2012.  On 23rd August 2012, he applied for
    a residence card as the spouse of an EEA national which was  issued  on
    21st February 2013.  On 22nd  July,2014,  the  respondent  revoked  the
    residence card, as a result of which the appellant appealed.

3.   His appeal hearing took place on 17th February 2015, before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lucas who allowed the  appeal  to  the  extent  that  it
    remain for the respondent to make a formal  decision.   The  respondent
    issued a further revocation letter dated 1st September  2015,  and  the
    appeal then came for hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin of
    Hendon Magistrates' Court on 23rd September, 2016.

4.   Judge Colvin  was  satisfied  that  the  respondent  was  justified  in
    revoking the appellant's residence card under  Regulation  22,  on  the
    grounds that the  appellant  had  ceased  the  right  to  reside  under
    regulations.

5.   The matter came for hearing before me, when  the  appellant  challenged
    Judge Colvin's determination on 22nd October 2017 by way of appeal.   I
    directed that the respondent should make enquiries of  HM  Customs  and
    Revenue to ascertain the extent to when the appellant's  former  spouse
    had ceased exercising treaty rights in the United  Kingdom,  if  indeed
    she had done so.

6.   Mr Kotas confirmed that on speaking  to  the  HM  Customs  and  Revenue
    hotline today they have no record of the appellant's spouse having paid
    PAYE for the last six years and the last  record  of  her  being  self-
    employed as a cleaner, is an assessment for the tax year 2013 to  2014.



7.   Counsel accepted that as at the date of  the  hearing  the  appellant's
    spouse was not exercising treaty rights and as a result  any  error  in
    the determination of Judge Colvin could not be material.  The  decision
    of the First Tier Tribunal Judge stands and  it  was  agreed  that  the
    appeal fell to be dismissed.

Summary

The appellant's counsel agreed that the determination  did  not  contain  an
error of law.
The judge's decision shall stand.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
