For the Respondent: Mr C Avery Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not deem it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Powell promulgated on 24 April 2014  which  dismissed  the
   Appellant's appeal on all grounds .

Background
3. The Appellant was born on 29 November 1978 and is a citizen of  Pakistan.
   On 24 July 2013 the Appellant applied for leave to remain in  the  United
   Kingdom as a Tier 4 (general) Student  Migrant  under  the  Points  Based
   System.
4. On 30 October  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
   application. The basis of the refusal was in essence that  the  Appellant
   was required to show that he had �9000 maintenance for the 28 day  period
   25 June 2013 to 22 July 2013 a figure based on the view that he  did  not
   have an 'established presence' in the UK.
The Judge's Decision
5. The Appellant appealed on a number of grounds but in essence argued  that
   as he had an 'established presence' in the United  Kingdom  he  was  only
   required to show that he had �2000  for  the  relevant  period;  he  also
   argued that the decision breached his rights under Article 8 of ECHR.
6.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Powell (hereinafter called "the  Judge")  dealt  with  the
   case on the papers. He dismissed  the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
   decision. The Judge found that the Appellant did not have the �9000 funds
   that the Respondent asserted he required  for  the  relevant  period;  he
   found that there was no evidence that the decision did not engage Article
   8.

7. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 9 July  2014  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
   Chalkley gave permission to appeal.

8. At the hearing Mr Avery on behalf of the Respondent conceded  that  there
   was a material error of law in the determination in  that  the  Appellant
   met the definition of 'established presence'  as  set  out  in  paragraph
   14(ii) of Appendix C given his previous period of leave  of  leave  as  a
   Tier 4 student. He accepted that the Appellant was applying for continued
   study on a single course and he had completed 6 months of the course.  He
   conceded that on the basis that the Appellant had an established presence
   the maintenance figure he had to show for the required period  was  �2000
   and he had that sum in his account for that period.

Finding on Material Error

9. Having  heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made a material error of law such that the Judge's determination
   cannot stand and must be set aside in its entirety.

10. I remade the decision.

11.  I was satisfied that given the concessions properly made  by  Mr  Avery
   on the basis of the documents provided to the  Respondent  the  Appellant
   had to show he had the sum of �2000 for the required period  and  he  had
   done so. He should therefore have been awarded the 10 points claimed  for
   maintenance.

Decision

12. There was an error on a point of law in the decision of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal such that the decision is set aside

13. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal.

14. There was no application for anonymity in this case and I see no  reason
   to make such a direction.



Signed                                                              Date
6.9.2014


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Birrell



                                  Fee Award

As I have remade the appeal and allowed it and because a fee has  been  paid
or is payable, I have considered making a fee  award  and  have  decided  to
make a fee award of any fee which has been paid or may  be  payable  as  the
application  should  have  been  granted  on  the  basis  of  the  documents
submitted to the Respondent .
