For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Mair, Counsel instructed by Silverdale Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of birth 6th October  1984.
 On the 15th April 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hague)  allowed  his
 appeal against the  decisions  to  remove  him  from  the  United  Kingdom
 pursuant to s47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 and to
 refuse to vary his leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.
 The Secretary of State now has permission to appeal against that decision.

2. The Secretary of State's refusal letter  is  dated  19th  November  2013.
 Therein it states that the Appellant will not be granted further leave  to
 remain as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur because  he  had  failed  to  satisfy  the
 decision-maker that he actually intended to invest the ï¿½50,000 he  had  in
 the bank into a genuine business.

3. Judge Hague heard oral evidence from the Respondent.  He  had  regard  to
 the documentary evidence before him. Having done  so  he  found  that  the
 Respondent was running a genuine business and that he did intend to invest
 the money in his bank account into it.  He allowed the appeal.

4. The Secretary of State does not seek to  challenge  those  findings.  The
 complaint made in the grounds of appeal is that the Judge somehow erred in
 allowing the appeal "outright". It is submitted that the Judge "failed  to
 give adequate reasons as to how the appellant meets the rules".




 My Findings on Error of Law

5. This was a closely reasoned and detailed refusal letter. The  application
 was refused because the decision-maker did not  believe  that  this  is  a
 genuine business. That was the only issue. The letter does not contain, as
 one sometimes sees, a saving provision to the effect that the Secretary of
 State has not gone on to consider the remainder of the rule  having  found
 the applicant to fall at an early hurdle. That this was the only issue was
 confirmed by the Presenting Officer before Judge Hague: see paragraph 3 of
 the determination.

6. There is therefore absolutely no merit in the suggestion that  the  Judge
 somehow erred in allowing  the  appeal  "outright".   The  refusal  letter
 raised one issue. That  it  was  the  only  issue  was  confirmed  by  the
 Secretary of State's representative  on  the  day.  That  sole  issue  was
 resolved in the Respondent's favour. As Mr  McVeety  conceded  before  me,
 there was no error in Judge Hague allowing the appeal on that basis.


 Decision

7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law  and  it
 is upheld.
