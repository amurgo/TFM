Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Tipping dismissing his appeal against the Secretary
    of State's decision to  refuse  his  asylum,  humanitarian  protection,
    Article 3 and Article 8 ECHR claims and to set removal  directions  for
    the Appellant's country of origin, Afghanistan.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Tipping dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  on
    all grounds.

 3. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal by Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Doyle by way of a decision which gave a limited grant of permission  on
    the Appellant's grounds 8, 9 and 10 (as numbered in his written grounds
    of appeal). The grounds may be summarised  as  taking  issue  with  the
    lawfulness of the judge's assessment of the Appellant's Article 8  ECHR
    private life outwith the immigration rules.

 4. I was not provided with a Rule 24 response from the Respondent.

    Submissions

 5. In advancing the Appellant's grounds of  appeal,  Mr  Turner  submitted
    inter alia that ground 8 is a statement of law and did not point to any
    particular error. He further submitted that ground 9 is an overview  of
    the relevant law but again  does  not  take  issue  with  the  decision
    itself. The  final  ground,  ground  10,  he  submitted  is  a  focused
    challenge on Article 8 however Mr Turner in short indicated he  was  in
    difficulty in advancing that ground as at �30,  the  judge  found  that
    Article 8 was engaged and that the Appellant entered the UK as a  child
    and attended school but had no friends and there  was  no  evidence  of
    community activity, and that  he  had  considered  proportionality.  Mr
    Turner realistically submitted that all he could  arguably  submit  was
    that although the judge had referred to the Appellant's age, he had not
    had regard to the Appellant's age and his integration in  the  UK  when
    reaching his conclusions. Ultimately, Mr Turner submitted  this  was  a
    rationality challenge.

 6. I then heard submissions from Mr Kandola who submitted in  reply  inter
    alia that the only area of dispute is the  matter  of  proportionality.
    The decision in Razgar had been explicitly mentioned at �30 and Article
    8 private life had been considered at ��29-32. The  Appellant  had  not
    demonstrated the decision was irrational or perverse and the judge  had
    considered the appeal as generously as he could.

 7. In response to my query regarding the Appellant's agreed date of birth,
    Mr Turner accepted that there had been an age assessment  conducted  in
    2009 which stated that the Appellant was born  on  15  July  1995,  and
    which had not been challenged however the Appellant was an adult at the
    date of the First-tier hearing.

 8. I asked both parties at the close of submissions whether they had
    anything further to add and both confirmed that they did not.

 9. At the close of submissions, I indicated that I would reserve my
    decision which I shall now give. I do not find that there was an error
    of law in the decision such that it should be set aside. My reasons for
    so finding are as follows.

    No Error of Law

10. As summarised by Mr Turner, notwithstanding the grounds of appeal which
    are largely bare statements  of  law,  this  appeal  is  in  essence  a
    rationality challenge to the decision of the First-tier.

11. It is clear from reading the decision that the  judge  considered  that
    Article 8 ECHR private life outwith the rules was engaged and  went  on
    to consider that private life in terms of the evidence that was  before
    him. Therefore, the grounds are incorrect in that  they  criticise  the
    judge for failing to consider Article 8 when this is precisely what  he
    has done.

12. The main issues raised by  the  Appellant  are  that  of  his  age  and
    integration; however as Mr Turner rightly stated, the judge  was  aware
    of the Appellant's age and that he arrived in the UK as a child and  in
    my assessment this was properly factored into the decision as a  whole.
    The judge explicitly accepted the private life that the  Appellant  had
    established in the UK "despite the  lack  of  evidence"  therefore,  Mr
    Kandola's submission that the consideration of Article 8  private  life
    was generous, despite there being a paucity of evidence  of  it,  is  a
    valid one.

13. I find that the judge at ��29-32 of his decision has drafted a  careful
    and comprehensive consideration of the Appellant's  Article  8  private
    life, the findings upon which were rational and open to  him  to  make,
    based on the evidence before him. It is clear that all relevant matters
    were taken into account and there is no omission as alleged.

14. Therefore, in conclusion, the grounds do not reveal  an  error  of  law
    such that the decision should be set aside.

15. In the circumstances the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed  and
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is affirmed.

    Decision

16. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
