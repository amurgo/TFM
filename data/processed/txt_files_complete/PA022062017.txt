                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge M Davies (the  judge)
    of the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 4th May 2017.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born 1st July 1979.  He  arrived
    in the UK together with his wife on 2nd April 2011.  The Appellant  had
    a visa as a Tier 4 (Student) Dependant.  The  Appellant  and  his  wife
    have three children, all born in the UK, in 2011, 2013 and 2014.

 3. The Appellant made an asylum and human rights claim on 16 August  2016.
    His claim was based upon a dispute with a local police officer and  the
    police officer's nephew, caused by the  political  affiliation  of  the
    Appellant's family.  In addition the Appellant claimed that he had been
    threatened by a terrorist group, Lashkar-e-Omar.

 4. The asylum and human rights application was refused  on  13th  February
    2017 and the appeal was heard by the FtT on 25th April 2017.  The judge
    heard evidence from the Appellant and found his claim to be in fear  of
    persecution  to  be  "wholly  unbelievable".   The  judge  placed  very
    significant weight upon the fact that the Appellant had delayed  making
    an asylum claim for a period of approximately five years  four  months.
    The judge did not believe the Appellant's claim that he and his brother
    had been kidnapped  and  tortured  in  Pakistan,  and  found  that  the
    Appellant had fabricated his asylum  claim  in  order  to  avoid  being
    removed from the United Kingdom.  The judge attached little  weight  to
    documentation that the Appellant  had  produced.   Although  the  judge
    found the Appellant to be an incredible witness, he went on to consider
    sufficiency of protection and internal relocation, finding  that  there
    was a sufficiency of protection in Pakistan, and the  Appellant  had  a
    reasonable internal relocation option.

 5. The judge considered Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention on Human
    Rights (the 1950 Convention) finding that the Appellant, his  wife  and
    three children are all citizens of Pakistan, and would be  returned  to
    Pakistan as a family unit where they could continue their family  life.
    There would therefore be no interference with their family  or  private
    life.

 6. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    The grounds are summarised below.

 7. It was contended that the judge had placed too much weight on the delay
    in claiming asylum.  It was contended  that  the  Appellant  had  given
    evidence and  there  were  no  inconsistencies  in  his  evidence,  and
    objective evidence  supported  the  Appellant's  account  but  was  not
    referred to by the judge.  It was contended that the judge  had  failed
    to give reasons for findings.

 8. It was contended  that  the  judge  had  materially  erred  in  law  by
    concluding that the delay in claiming asylum, in  itself,  had  fatally
    damaged the Appellant's credibility.

 9. With reference to internal relocation it was contended that this  would
    be unduly  harsh,  and  the  judge  had  erred  by  not  reaching  that
    conclusion.

10. It was further contended that the judge had erred by failing  to  refer
    to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules in relation to  the
    Appellant's private life.

11. It was contended that the judge had erred by not referring  to  section
    55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  The judge had
    not taken into account that the Appellant and his wife had been in  the
    UK since April 2011 and had entered lawfully and  have  three  children
    who were born in the UK.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by  Judge  Bird  of  the  FtT  in  the
    following terms;

         2.   The Appellant seeks permission to appeal against this decision
             on the grounds that the judge made an arguable error of law in
             his assessment of his claim.  Ground 1 alleges that the  "nub"
             of the reasons given by  the  judge  was  that  the  Appellant
             claimed asylum with a delay of five years and four months.  It
             is alleged that this dictated  the  judge's  findings  on  the
             totality of the  Appellant's  evidence.   In  this  the  judge
             failed to properly consider the evidence  that  the  Appellant
             had  submitted  which  included  documentary   evidence,   the
             validity of which was not disputed by the Respondent.

         3.   In considering the decision of the judge it is clear that  the
             starting  point  for  the  assessment   of   the   Appellant's
             credibility was  the  delay  in  making  a  claim  for  asylum
             (paragraph 28).  The consideration of the judge's findings  in
             relation to the Appellant's credibility started  at  paragraph
             45 and again, it is evident that the delay was the  foundation
             from which the Appellant's credibility was considered.  It  is
             arguable that  in  basing  the  totality  of  the  Appellant's
             evidence on this the judge has made an arguable error of  law.



13. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008.  In summary it was contended that the judge had not erred in  law
    and had directed himself appropriately.   It  was  submitted  that  any
    error in dealing with the delay was not material as the judge had dealt
    with the factual matrix of the asylum claim at  paragraphs  47-49,  and
    reached a conclusion which was open to him, that the Appellant was  not
    credible and had fabricated the claim.  The judge was entitled to reach
    his own conclusion on the documentary evidence produced and dealt  with
    internal relocation at paragraph 48 of the decision.

14. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the judge had erred in law such that  the
    decision should be set aside.

Submissions

15. Mr Moksud relied upon the grounds contained within the application  for
    permission to appeal.  It was submitted that the  judge  had  erred  at
    paragraph 38 by describing the delay in claiming  asylum  as  fatal  to
    credibility.  It was further contended that  the  judge  had  erred  by
    finding unreliable,  an  FIR  which  the  Respondent  had  accepted  as
    genuine.  Mr Moksud submitted that  the  Appellant  had  explained  the
    delay in his witness statement at paragraph 13 and this  had  not  been
    taken into account, and the judge was wrong to regard delay in claiming
    asylum as the sole factor when considering credibility.

16. Mr Moksud pointed out that the Appellant had three children in the  UK,
    the eldest being approximately 6ï¿½ years of  age.   The  judge  had  not
    considered the best interests of the  children  which  was  a  material
    error of law.

17. Mr Moksud  submitted  that  Article  8  proportionality  had  not  been
    considered,  and  it  was  an   error   not   to   consider   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi).  I was asked to set aside the FtT decision.

18. Mrs Aboni relied upon the rule 24 response and submitted that the judge
    had not materially erred in law.  I was asked to accept that the  judge
    had made findings which were open to him to make on the  evidence,  and
    it was open to the judge to attach significant weight to the  delay  in
    claiming asylum.  The judge had made it clear at the beginning  of  the
    hearing he was concerned by the delay, and the  judge  found  that  the
    evidence given by the Appellant and submissions made on his behalf  did
    not deal with the question of delay.

19. Mrs Aboni submitted that delay was not the only reason  for  making  an
    adverse credibility finding against the Appellant, as other reasons had
    been given.

20. Mrs Aboni submitted that it was open to the  judge  to  reach  his  own
    conclusions on documentary evidence, but in the  alternative,  even  if
    the judge had erred in assessing credibility, there  was  no  error  in
    relation to the conclusions  reached  in  relation  to  sufficiency  of
    protection and internal relocation.

21. I was asked to accept  that  Article  8  was  adequately  addressed  at
    paragraph 51 and to note that the children were not  British  citizens,
    and had not resided in the  UK  for  at  least  seven  years.   It  was
    submitted that the FtT decision should stand.

22. By way of response, Mr Moksud submitted  that  there  was  no  adequate
    consideration of sufficiency of protection or internal relocation.

23. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

24. The conclusions reached by the judge commence at paragraph 45 in  which
    the judge records that before receiving evidence  he  stressed  to  the
    Appellant's representative that he  must  deal  with  the  question  of
    delay, both  in  the  evidence  given  by  the  Appellant  and  in  his
    submissions, but this was not done.  The judge records that  the  delay
    is fatally damaging to the Appellant's credibility.  The Respondent did
    not raise the delay in claiming asylum as a major issue in the  reasons
    for refusal, and did not raise section 8 of the Asylum and  Immigration
    (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.  That of course does not  mean
    that the judge was not entitled to raise delay, and in my view  he  was
    clearly fully entitled to consider  the  substantial  delay  before  an
    asylum claim was made.

25. However, the evidence must be considered holistically and in the round.
     The impression gained from reading this decision, is  that  the  judge
    has made an  adverse  credibility  finding  based  upon  the  delay  in
    claiming  asylum,  and  reached  this  view  before  considering  other
    evidence.

26. The judge does not consider the explanation given by the Appellant  for
    the delay.   That  explanation  is  contained  within  the  Appellant's
    witness statement at paragraph 13,  which  the  Appellant  relied  upon
    before the FtT.  The explanation is that the  Appellant  feared  if  he
    submitted an  application  he  would  be  arrested  and  sent  back  to
    Pakistan, and made his claim  for  asylum  after  obtaining  sufficient
    information.  It may be that the judge would  not  have  found  this  a
    satisfactory explanation, but there is no analysis of that  explanation
    apparent in the FtT decision.

27. At paragraph 46 the judge makes a finding that the Appellant's claim to
    be in fear of persecution is wholly unbelievable  and  states  that  he
    makes that finding on the basis of delay of five years and four  months
    in making an asylum claim.

28. At paragraph 47 the judge finds that the Appellant and his brother were
    not kidnapped  and  tortured  as  claimed,  and  the  asylum  claim  is
    fabricated, and goes on to record, "That being the case I attach little
    weight to the documentation that  the  Appellant  has  produced".   The
    judge notes that the  Respondent  concluded  that  the  FIR  which  the
    Appellant  had  produced  was  likely  to  be  genuine,  but  finds  it
    reasonably likely that it is not genuine "bearing  in  mind  the  fatal
    damage to the Appellant's credibility".  The reason given by the  judge
    for concluding that the Appellant's credibility is fatally  damaged  is
    the delay in claiming asylum.

29. Therefore it appears from reading this decision, it is the  delay  that
    has caused the judge to disbelieve the Appellant's account, and to find
    that a document accepted as genuine by the Respondent was not genuine.

30. Weight that must be attached to evidence is  a  matter  for  the  judge
    conducting the hearing,  but  the  judge  must  consider  the  evidence
    holistically, and must consider any explanation offered in relation  to
    the delay, and must give sustainable reasons for conclusions reached.

31. In my view, for the reasons given above, the judge has erred in law  in
    considering credibility.  However I  do  not  find  that  error  to  be
    material for the following reasons.

32. The judge considered sufficiency of protection and internal  relocation
    at paragraphs 48 and 55.  Both sufficiency of protection  and  internal
    relocation were dealt with at some length in the  Respondent's  refusal
    letter.

33. It was the Respondent's case  that  there  existed  within  Pakistan  a
    sufficiency of  protection  from  the  authorities,  and  a  reasonable
    internal relocation option.  This was not a case  where  the  Appellant
    feared persecution by the State, his fear was of a local policeman  and
    that policeman's nephew, and threats made by a terrorist  organisation.
    I have considered the Appellant's skeleton argument that was before the
    FtT.  Sufficiency of protection is dealt with briefly, at  paragraph  5
    of the skeleton argument, the Appellant's case being that he  would  be
    unable to  seek  protection  from  the  State,  because  the  Appellant
    "believes that law enforcement agencies  in  Pakistan  do  not  provide
    sufficient protection to the ordinary people".

34. Internal flight is dealt with at paragraph 6 of the  skeleton  argument
    on the basis that there would be no reasonable internal  flight  option
    because "Pakistan is a lawless country".

35. Based upon the evidence that was before the FtT, my view  is  that  the
    judge was entitled to  conclude  at  paragraphs  48  and  55  that  the
    Appellant had produced no evidence to indicate that there  would  be  a
    lack of adequate protection in Pakistan, or that he could not  move  to
    another area of Pakistan.  I  find  that  the  conclusions  reached  in
    relation  to  internal  relocation,  and  sufficiency  of   protection,
    although brief, are adequate and I do not find that  the  grounds  upon
    which permission to appeal was granted, disclose any error  of  law  in
    relation to sufficiency of  protection  or  the  option  of  reasonable
    internal relocation.

36. With reference to Article 8, it is the case that there was no  specific
    reference by the judge to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi), but at paragraph  51
    the judge concludes that the Appellant, his  wife  and  three  children
    would be returned to Pakistan as a family unit  and  that  family  life
    "can continue without any difficulty in  Pakistan".   In  addition  the
    judge found that there was  a  reasonable  internal  relocation  option
    which would not be unduly  harsh.   Therefore  although  there  was  no
    specific reference to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and the question of  very
    significant obstacles, it is clear that the judge  did  not  find  that
    there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   the   Appellant's
    integration into Pakistan, because of his findings in paragraphs 48, 51
    and 55 which confirm his conclusion that the family could enjoy  family
    life without any  difficulty,  and  there  was  a  reasonable  internal
    relocation option.  There was therefore no material  error  of  law  in
    failing to specifically mention 276ADE(1)(vi).

37. It is correct that the judge did not specifically refer to  section  55
    of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009.   This  was
    considered by the Respondent in the  reasons  for  refusal  letter  and
    relates to the duty on the Secretary of State to  have  regard  to  the
    need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who  are  in  the
    UK.  It is incumbent upon a judge to consider  the  best  interests  of
    children.  In this case, the judge has considered the children,  noting
    that they are citizens of Pakistan.   It  is  common  ground  that  the
    children had not resided in the UK for seven years.   While  the  judge
    did not specifically refer to the best interests of the children, it is
    in my view apparent that he took the view that the best interest of the
    children, taking into account their young  ages,  would  be  served  by
    remaining with their parents  and  returning  to  Pakistan  with  their
    parents.  Taking into account the ages of the  children,  it  is  clear
    that their best interests would  be  served  by  remaining  with  their
    parents. The finding by the judge that the children  should  return  to
    Pakistan with their parents, is a finding open to him, and  is  not  an
    error of law.

38. In conclusion, although in my view the judge did err in law, as set out
    above, the errors were not material and the decision is not unsafe.   I
    therefore dismiss the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT does not disclose material errors of law  such  that
it must be set aside.  I do not set  aside  the  decision.   The  appeal  is
dismissed.

Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made by the FtT.  There has been  no  request  to
the Upper Tribunal for an anonymity direction, and in  the  circumstances  I
see no need to make such a direction.
