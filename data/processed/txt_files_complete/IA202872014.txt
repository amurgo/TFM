                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Malik promulgated on 18 August 2014 which dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal against a decision dated 25 April 2014  refusing  an
    application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur under the Points Based System and to make  directions  for
    his removal under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality
    Act 2006.

 3. The Appellant's case is linked  to  that  of  his  wife  Satinder  Kaur
    (IA/06336/2014) as they were part of an Entrepreneurial Team  in  their
    Tier 1 applications which were made on different  dates  and  were  the
    subject of different refusal decisions. Her case  was  heard  before  a
    different Judge on another date and has also  been  appealed  and  came
    before me today. While there were some  common  issues  inevitably  the
    decisions nevertheless involved different Judges and  different  issues
    in refusal so her appeal is the subject of a separate decision.

Background

 4. The Appellant was born on 20 January 1986 and is a national of India.

 5. The Appellant was in the United Kingdom from 2010 as a Tier  4  Student
    and after renewing that leave it was due to expire on 6 February 2014.

 6. The Appellant and his wife were part of a Tier 1 Entrepreneurial  team.
    On 14 November 2013 the Appellant and his wife Satinder  Kaur  made  an
    application for leave in that category. That  application  was  refused
    essentially on the basis that a  letter  they  had  produced  from  the
    Punjab national Bank dated 24 October 2013 was false.

 7. The decision in relation to his wife carried a right of appeal and  his
    did not. The appeal in respect of his wife's decision came before First
    tier Tribunal Judge O Williams on 6 June  2014  and  he  dismissed  her
    appeal finding that the bank letter in issue had not been issued by the
    bank and therefore the refusal under paragraph 322 (1A) and  245DD  was
    in accordance with the Immigration Rules. I  heard  an  appeal  against
    that decision and upheld it as I was  satisfied  that  the  Judge  made
    findings that were in accordance with the evidence before him.

 8. As this Appellant did not have a right of appeal he reapplied for leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur on 6 February 2014.

 9. On 25 April  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons:

      a) The Appellant submitted two Fixed Deposit Certificates from  Punjab
         National Bank that were found not to be genuine and  therefore  the
         application was refused under paragraph 322 (1A) of the Rules as he
         had used deception in his application.

      b) The  Appellant  had  made  a  previous  application  as  a  Tier  1
         Entrepreneur on 14 November 2013 and produced  a  letter  from  the
         Punjab National Bank that was found to be false. The Appellant  was
         advised that any further applications for leave to remain would  be
         refused under paragraph 320(7B) as he had previously  attempted  to
         obtain leave to remain by deception.

      c) The Appellant also claimed points under Appendix A for  Attributes.
         The Appellant could not be awarded the 25 points claimed for access
         to funds as the Fixed Deposit Certificates  were  not  genuine  nor
         would they have met  the  evidential  requirements;  the  contracts
         provided in support of the application did not meet  the  mandatory
         evidential requirements of 41-SD(e) (iii) and (iv) because they did
         not state the services to be provided.

The Judge's Decision

10. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Malik ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against the Respondent's
    decision. In dismissing the appeal the Judge found :

      a) At the time of his application the  Appellant  sought  to  rely  on
         Fixed Deposit funds in accounts  starting  4899  and  3541  in  the
         Punjab National Bank in the name of Madan Lal.

      b) The Judge considered the contents of a Document Verification Report
         and set those contents out in full at paragraph 13. In essence  the
         Bank confirmed on 23 April 2014 that there was a lien  against  the
         account ending 4899 and therefore the available amount was nil  and
         in respect of the second account was also subject  of  a  lien  and
         only Rs 19,032 was available. Thus any  certificate  in  the  banks
         name at the time of  the  application  produced  by  the  Appellant
         suggesting that more funds were available  was  false.  The  report
         went on to confirm that another certificate 6804 was genuine.

      c) The Appellant subsequently obtained further  information  from  the
         bank namely a letter and computerised printouts which  showed  that
         the fixed deposits were paid at maturity in August 2014. The  Judge
         therefore accepted that at the time of her decision the funds  were
         available.

      d)  The Judge found however that the evidence produced did not address
         whether liens/ loans were on  the  FD  accounts  at  the  time  the
         Respondent made their checks and were told by  the  bank  that  the
         funds were not available until the loans were paid.

      e) In the absence of any  evidence  to  address  why  the  information
         contained in the DVR of 23 April 2014 would be inaccurate the Judge
         accepted it was accurate.

      f) The Judge found that although there was evidence that the Appellant
         had in excess of �50,000 in a United Kingdom account in June  /July
         2014 the Judge could not consider this as it  was  not  before  the
         decision maker when they made their  decision  nor  was  there  any
         explanation as to why  if  they  were  available  at  the  time  of
         application they were not relied on to support the application.

      g) In relation to paragraph 320(7B)  the  Judge  had  before  her  the
         decision of First-tier tribunal Judge Williams in relation  to  the
         appeal against the first application the Appellant and his wife had
         made for leave to remain as Tier 1 Entrepreneurs. That refusal  had
         been on the basis that the Appellants had submitted a  letter  from
         Punjab Bank dated 25 October 2013 that the Respondent was satisfied
         was false as they confirmed with the issuing body that they had not
         issued the  letter.   The  Judge  noted  that  Judge  Williams  had
         dismissed the appeal and there was clearly a  material  overlap  in
         evidence. However she also considered the DVR produced  in  respect
         of the letter of 25 October 2013. As no evidence had been  produced
         to counter the reasons for refusal there  was  no  reason  to  look
         behind the decision of Judge Williams.

      h) In respect of the refusal based on the evidential requirements  not
         being met in relation to the contents of the  contracts  the  Judge
         found  that  contrary  to  the  arguments  of  the  Appellant   the
         provisions relating to evidential flexibility  in  paragraph  245AA
         did not apply as the application  was  being  refused  for  another
         reason.

11. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that :

      a)  The  Appellant  submitted  an   appeal   bundle   that   contained
         computerised bank statements for  the  Fixed  Deposit  accounts  in
         issue for the period 3.2.2014-22.5.2014 which  confirmed  that  the
         Appellant had access to the funds at the time when the home  office
         made their checks.

      b) In the appeal bundle there was also a letter from  the  bank  which
         confirmed that there was no lien on the Fixed Deposits.

      c) The DVR dated 23 April 2014 gave an incorrect number for  the  bank
         branch and for  the  name  of  the  contact  there.  The  Appellant
         produced a copy of a print out from the banks website  as  evidence
         and this had been included in the appeal bundle and claims this was
         discussed in the appeal hearing but not referred to by the Judge in
         her decision.

      d) In relation to the decision by Judge  Williams  there  was  also  a
         letter in the appeal bundle from the Punjab National Bank  dated  2
         July 2014 confirming that they had issued the letter of 24  October
         2013. This was discussed in court but Judge Malik did not  consider
         this letter in her decision.

12. On 26 September 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Molloy  gave  permission
    to appeal.

13. At the hearing I heard submissions from the Appellant that :

      a) There was evidence in the appeal bundle to the  Upper  Tribunal  at
         pages 26 and 27 that  showed  that  the  money  relied  on  by  the
         Appellant in the fixed deposit accounts was available as he claimed
         at the date of the DVR on 23 April 2014.

      b) There was a letter dated 22 July 2014 from the Punjab national Bank
         at page 28 confirming there was no lien on the FD  account  and  an
         affidavit from his father at page 29 dated 21 June 2014 to the same
         effect.

      c) The letter at page 2 of the bundle  dated  2  July  2014  from  the
         Punjab National Bank stating that the Bank certificate issued on 24
         October 2013 to Madan Lal was genuine and this was  not  considered
         by Judge Malik at the hearing.

14. On behalf of the Respondent  Ms Johnson submitted that ;

      a) The Judge recorded in detail at paragraphs 7-9  the  evidence  that
         the Appellant seeks to suggest she did not take into account.

      b) The documents relied on by the  Appellant  in  his  Upper  Tribunal
         bundle were printed on 14 October 2014 and cannot have been  before
         the Judge.

      c)  The  Judge  however  at  paragraph  15  of  her  findings  clearly
         considered the computerised print outs relied on by the Appellant.

      d) The Appellant had been refused on the basis of  not  meeting  other
         requirements of the Rules as to  the  contracts  he  submitted  not
         containing required information.

Legal Framework

15. Of some significance in this case are those legal provisions which were
    set out by the Judge at paragraph 6 of her decision  that  govern  what
    evidence she was able to consider in  reaching  her  decision  in  this
    appeal because paragraph 322 (7B) is not a PBS case but the refusal  of
    the application as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur is a PBS case.

16. Under section 85(4) of the 2002 Act on appeal under section  82(1)  and
    83 the Tribunal can consider evidence about any matter which it  thinks
    is relevant to the substance of the decision including  evidence  which
    concerns a matter arising after the date of decision.  However, section
    85(4) of the 2002 Act is now subject to  the  exceptions  contained  in
    section 85A, which was brought into force  by  section  19  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2009.  Pursuant to exception  1,  in  appeals  against  the
    refusal of entry clearance or a refusal of a certificate of entitlement
    under section 10 the Tribunal  "may  consider  only  the  circumstances
    appertaining at the time of decision".

The Law

17.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow  binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or  giving
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

18. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail  to
    deal with every factual issue  under  argument.  Disagreement  with  an
    Immigrations Judge's factual conclusions, his appraisal of the evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law. Unless an Immigration  Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have  taken  no  account  of  evidence  that  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible. Nor is it necessary  to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration judge concludes that the story told is untrue. If  a  point
    of evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is
    a failure to take into account a material consideration.

Finding on Material Error

19. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

20. The Appellant made an application dated 6 February 2014 in which at G10
    of his application he claimed on the basis of a letter from the  Punjab
    National Bank to have access to �50,000 Fixed Deposits.

21. The Judge had before her and set out in full at paragraph 13 a Document
    Verification Report including the contents of a phone call made  on  23
    April 2014 to Dev Raj Dutt Senior Manager of GT Road Branch of the  PNB
    whose number was obtained from the DVU database. He  gave  the  Manager
    the account numbers for the accounts relied on and  was  told  that  as
    there were liens on both accounts and that the available balance on one
    account was nil and the other was less than the amount required.

22. The Appellant argues that the judge failed to consider those  documents
    that he submitted in his appeal bundle to the First-tier tribunal  that
    included computer generated bank statements of the FD  accounts  and  a
    letter suggesting that there was no lien on the account.

23. I am satisfied that the Judge had before  her  and  took  into  account
    those documents that the Appellant asserts she did not consider because
    she clearly refers to them in detail in the context firstly of his oral
    evidence at paragraphs 7-9 and in her findings at page 15. However  the
    Judge found that the Appellant had produced no evidence as to  why  the
    bank manager provided to the consular official who made the enquiry  on
    23 April 2014 the information that there were liens  on  the  accounts.
    She accepted that there was new information to suggest that  the  funds
    were now available but this did not address the fact  in  issue  as  to
    whether on the date of the enquiry there were liens on the accounts  as
    of course the Manager made clear in the DVR that when  the  liens  were
    paid the funds became available.

24. The other documents produced by the Appellant fail to be  relevant  for
    the same reason: the affidavit from his father dated 21 June 2014,  the
    letter from the bank dated 22 July 2014 which  although  hard  to  read
    appears to state 'no lien on FDR', the letter from the  bank  dated  30
    July 2014. None of the documents before the  Judge  address  the  issue
    underpinning the claim of deception which was whether  there  had  ever
    been a lien on the accounts and specifically on the date  of  the  DVR.
    The Judge took into account the explanations offered by  the  Appellant
    but preferred to rely on the contents of the DVR and this was a finding
    open to her.

25. The Judge was entitled to refuse to take into account evidence that the
    Appellant had �50,000 in a United Kingdom bank account because this was
    not the basis of the application made by him.

26. In relation to the refusal under paragraph 320(7B) the  Judge  set  out
    her findings at paragraph 17-18 and concluded that the starting in  her
    case was, given the guidance in Devaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT  000702,  the
    decision of Judge Williams in as it related to an application  made  by
    the Appellant's wife as part of a joint Entrepreneurial team  with  him
    using a letter dated 24 October 2013 which the Respondent asserted  was
    false on the basis of a DVR. The Judge made a finding that  the  letter
    from Punjab Bank dated 24 October 2013 was not issued by them and  that
    is a decision that I have upheld.

27. This Appellant  claims  that  in  stating  at  paragraph  19  that  the
    Appellant had failed to counter the reason for refusal in  relation  to
    the letter of 24 October 2013  she  did  not  consider  the  letter  he
    produced from Punjab Bank( signed by the Manager although his  name  is
    not printed and is otherwise unclear )dated 2 July 2014 in  which  they
    stated that a bank certificate issued on 24 October 2013 to  Madan  Lal
    was issued by their branch. This was before the  Judge  in  the  appeal
    bundle that she has otherwise clearly referenced. She is not of  course
    obliged to make findings in respect of every document before her. Given
    her other findings even if she did not consider this document the error
    was not material as the appeal failed for other reasons that  were  not
    challenged in the  grounds  of  appeal  such  as  the  failure  of  the
    contracts to meet the requirements of paragraph 41-SD . I am  bound  to
    say that even had she considered it I am satisfied that her  conclusion
    would not have changed as again it fails to address the  issue  of  why
    the manager spoken to by the  consular  official  stated  both  on  the
    telephone and confirmed in writing that the  bank  did  not  issue  the
    letter of 24 October 2013.

28. I remind myself of what was said in Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set
    aside) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT  85  (IAC)  about  the  requirement  for
    sufficient reasons to be given in a decision in headnote (1): "Although
    there is a legal duty to give a brief explanation of the conclusions on
    the central issue on which an appeal is determined, those reasons  need
    not be extensive if the decision as a whole makes sense, having  regard
    to the material accepted by the judge."

29. I was therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read as a
    whole set out findings that were sustainable and sufficiently  detailed
    and based on cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

30. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

31. The appeal is dismissed.
