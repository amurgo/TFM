Representation:

For the appellants: Ms E Daykin instructed by ATM Law solicitors
For the respondent: Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The  appellants,  nationals  of  India,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal against decisions  by  the  respondent  dated  15  October  2013
   refusing to grant indefinite leave to remain as Tier 1 (General) Migrants
   and against decisions by the respondent to remove them from the UK  under
   section 47 of the Immigration Nationality and Asylum Act 2006.  Judge  of
   the First-tier Tribunal Trevaskis considered the appeals  on  the  papers
   and dismissed the appeals. The appellants now appeal with  permission  to
   this Tribunal.

2. The background to these appeals is that the first appellant  entered  the
   UK as a working holidaymaker with the  second  appellant,  his  dependant
   spouse, and was subsequently granted leave to remain as a Highly  Skilled
   Migrant until 30 August 2009. On 13 August 2009 he  was  granted  further
   leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 30 August 2012. On 21
   August 2012 he applied for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
   (General) Migrant and the second appellant was named  as  his  dependant.
   The applications were refused under paragraph 322 (2) of the  Immigration
   Rules because the respondent considered  that  the  first  appellant  had
   employed deception in a previous application for leave  to  remain,  that
   submitted on 22 July 2009, when he claimed that he  had  earned  ï¿½4422.88
   through contracted work with Ransab Limited between 1 January 2009 and 30
   June 2009. That application was submitted on the  appellant's  behalf  by
   Migration Gurus. It was contended by the  respondent  that  following  an
   investigation by the Home Office and  the  police,  individuals  involved
   with Migration Gurus were convicted  of  unlawful  immigration  practices
   including the  use  of  bogus  companies  to  falsify  earnings  of  visa
   applicants and one of those bogus companies was Ransab Limited.

3. The appellants originally requested an oral hearing  however  on  29  May
   2014 the apps representatives notified the Tribunal that  the  appellants
   wished instead to have the appeals determined on the papers. The  hearing
   had been scheduled for 19 June 2014 and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   determined the appeals on the papers on 20 June 2014.  The Judge accepted
   that false representations had been made or false documents submitted and
   dismissed the appeal under paragraph 332 (2) and under  Appendix  FM  and
   paragraph 276ADE of the Rules.

4. There are two grounds of appeal. The first is on the basis of  procedural
   unfairness. The second is that, in considering  the  general  grounds  of
   refusal, the First-tier Tribunal Judge applied the wrong paragraph of the
   Rules, paragraph 322(1A) instead of paragraph 322(2).

5. In relation to the procedural unfairness issue Ms Daykin  submitted  that
   the appellants' representatives were advised by telephone that they would
   be given a date by which further evidence should  be  submitted  for  the
   paper appeal. However I do not accept that this would be normal  practice
   when an appeal is changed from an oral hearing to a paper appeal.  It  is
   not in dispute that the  respondent  served  documents  on  the  Tribunal
   received on 12 June 2014. The appellants received the documents the  same
   day. The hearing was scheduled for 19 June. The  original  directions  in
   this case were issued by the Tribunal along with the Notice of Hearing on
   28 November 2013. These required both parties to send  further  documents
   to be relied on to the tribunal and the other party to  arrive  no  later
   than 5 days before the date of the full hearing. I am satisfied that  the
   respondent failed to comply with that direction in serving the additional
   documents which arrived on  12  June.  Mr  Whitwell  submitted  that  the
   appellant was legally represented and that if he did not have  sufficient
   time to respond to the further documents he should have sought additional
   time. Ms Daykin clarified, and I accept the evidence on this matter, that
   the appellant was not in fact  legally  represented  at  this  time.  The
   documents were sent instead to a relative who had helped him complete the
   appeal notice. The documents served by the  respondent  included  witness
   statements  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  decision  in  relation  to   the
   proceedings against those involved with Migration Gurus. I  am  satisfied
   that the appellant did not have  sufficient  time  to  respond  to  those
   documents before the scheduled date for the hearing when the appeals were
   considered on the papers.

6. The second ground of appeal  is  that  the  Judge  considered  the  wrong
   paragraph of the general grounds for refusal. The relevant provisions  of
   paragraph 322 are as follows;

"322. In addition to the grounds for refusal of extension of  stay  set  out
in Parts 2-8 of these Rules, the following provisions apply in  relation  to
the refusal of an application for leave to remain,  variation  of  leave  to
enter or remain or, where appropriate, the curtailment of leave:

Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or remain
in the United Kingdom are to be refused
...

(1A) where false representations  have  been  made  or  false  documents  or
information  have  been  submitted  (whether  or   not   material   to   the
application, and whether or not to the applicant's knowledge),  or  material
facts have not been disclosed, in relation to the application  or  in  order
to obtain documents from the Secretary of State or a  third  party  required
in support of the application.
...
Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or remain
in the United Kingdom should normally be refused

(2) the making of false representations  or  the  failure  to  disclose  any
material fact for the purpose of obtaining leave  to  enter  or  a  previous
variation of leave or in order to obtain documents  from  the  Secretary  of
State or a third party required in support of the application for  leave  to
enter or a previous variation of leave.

..."

7. Paragraph 322 (1A)  is  therefore  a  mandatory  ground  of  refusal  and
   paragraph 322 (2) is a discretionary ground. The respondent  refused  the
   application under paragraph 322 (2).   The  Judge  referred  to  this  in
   paragraph 6 of the determination. However the Judge went on  to  consider
   this issue and, at paragraph 10,  said;

"I find that false representations have been made or  false  documents  have
been submitted (whether or not material to the application, and  whether  or
not to the applicant's knowledge). The Appellants do not appear  to  dispute
this"



8. Mr Whitwell submitted that paragraph 10 should be read with  paragraph  9
   where the Judge outlines the convictions relating to Migration  Guru  and
   an apparent conflict in the first appellant's evidence in that he  claims
   that he was innocent yet said in his grounds of appeal  that  he  trusted
   Migration Gurus 'not really understanding the methods employed by  them'.
   I am not satisfied that paragraph 9 casts light on the  Judge's  findings
   at paragraph 10.

9. I am satisfied that there is a difference between the test to be  applied
   in considering paragraph 322 (1A) as opposed to 322 (2). It is not  clear
   from reading the determination which test the  Judge  applied.  For  that
   reason the Judge made an error of law.

10. I am satisfied that both errors identified  in  the  grounds  of  appeal
   together amount to a material error. As the errors go to the heart of the
   issues to be determined in this case and undermine the findings made I am
   satisfied that none of the findings of fact can stand.

11. I am satisfied that the appellants have not therefore had their  appeals
   properly considered by the First-tier  Tribunal.  Mr  Whitwell  submitted
   that due to the issues involved and the  probability  of  the  respondent
   adducing further evidence the appeals should be remitted  to  the  First-
   tier Tribunal. Ms Daykins agreed. I am  satisfied  that  the  nature  and
   extent of the judicial fact finding which is necessary in order  for  the
   decision to be remade is such  that  (having  regard  to  the  overriding
   objective in Rule 2 of the Upper Tribunal Procedure  Rules  2008)  it  is
   appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

The Judge made an error on a point of  law  and  the  determination  of  the
First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be remade.
