For the Appellant:     Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by UKCN

      Consultancy

For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

No anonymity order requested or made


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This determination refers to parties  as  they  were  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

2) The appellant is a citizen of  China,  born  on  9  December  1985.   She
   applied on 9 January 2013 to remain in the UK as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
   Migrant under the Points Based System.

3) Page 1 of the respondent's decision dated 8  April  2013  says  that  the
   application has been "refused under the Immigration Rules".

4) At page 2 a box headed "Access  to  funds  as  required"  says  that  the
   appellant claimed 25 points but none have been awarded:

    You have stated that you have access to  funds  of  ï¿½200,000  ...  made
    available ... by your team member.


    Although a declaration has been supplied by the team member ... it does
    not show your signature as required.


    In addition there is no declaration  from  a  legal  representative  to
    establish  that  the  letter   of   permission   supplied   is   valid.
    Furthermore, there is no evidence to show that you can have  access  to
    the team member's funds in the form of a bank letter.


    We have therefore been  unable  to  award  points,  in  line  with  the
    published guidance and the Immigration Rules.


5) In the next box no points  are  awarded  for  "funds  held  in  regulated
   financial institutions", for similar reasons:

    As we have established that you have not  demonstrated  ...  access  to
    funds as required we are unable to accurately assess this attribute  as
    you have not demonstrated that the full amount of the funds ... is held
    with regulated financial institutions.  We have therefore  been  unable
    to award points, in line with the published guidance and Appendix A  of
    the Immigration Rules.


6) In the next box no points are awarded for "funds disposable in the UK":

    ... As we have established that you have not demonstrated ... access to
    funds as required, we are unable to accurately  assess  this  attribute
    ...


    We therefore have been  unable  to  award  points,  in  line  with  the
    published guidance and Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.


7) First-tier Tribunal Judge Snape allowed the appellant's  appeal,  without
   an oral hearing, by determination promulgated on 27 August 2013.

8) At paragraph 2, the judge said that neither party had filed  evidence  or
   submissions which had not been seen by the other party.  Further  in  her
   determination, she recorded further evidence produced  by  the  appellant
   with her grounds of appeal, and later.  At paragraph 7  the  judge  said,
   "As this is an in-country appeal, I am able to consider the  evidence  as
   it is on the date of the hearing."  On the basis of the further evidence,
   she allowed the appeal.

9) The SSHD appeals to the Upper Tribunal on the following grounds:

    Section 85A of the ... 2002 Act sets down that  evidence  can  only  be
    considered if ... submitted with the application ... the judge ...  has
    failed to give adequate reasons for admitting  evidence  that  she  was
    prevented from considering by operation of section 85A ...


    In Raju and Others  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  754  the  court  held  that  the
    appellant has to send all the information to the respondent by the date
    of application and not by the date of decision ...  the  appellant  has
    only submitted the information after the date of  application  and  ...
    cannot meet the Rules.


    Raju ... applies to all points based cases.


10) The appellant concedes that Judge Snape erred in law, as stated  in  the
   SSHD's grounds.  However, an  extended  answer  is  made  in  a  skeleton
   argument prepared by Mr A W Devlin, advocate, (who appeared at an earlier
   hearing which had to be adjourned, and was not available at the  date  of
   the hearing before me) and in further submissions by Mr Caskie.

11) The appellant says that the case should have  succeeded  in  the  First-
   tier Tribunal in any event, notwithstanding Raju and also notwithstanding
   Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2.  The skeleton argument runs thus.  Rodriguez
   did  not  decide  that  an  appellant  cannot  rely  on  the   evidential
   flexibility policy.  It  does  hold  that  the  respondent's  failure  to
   consider such policy cannot be inferred  from  the  mere  fact  that  she
   failed to contact an applicant  for  further  documents.   Rodriguez  was
   concerned with the situation before paragraph 245AA was inserted into the
   Rules on 12 December 2012.  The appellant could not have  benefited  from
   paragraph 245AA, but that  paragraph  did  not  expressly  supersede  the
   evidential flexibility policy in its June 2011 version, which remained on
   the respondent's website until revised guidance on evidential flexibility
   was issued on 20 May 2013.  The present case is distinct  from  Rodriguez
   in that this decision letter did not look at the respondent's policy  but
   was "addressed solely to the Immigration  Rules"  (paragraph  52  of  the
   skeleton argument).  Under the June 2011  evidential  flexibility  policy
   the respondent was not only entitled but obliged to contact the appellant
   for the missing information "as it ought reasonably to  have  been  clear
   that such information was available" (paragraphs 57-59).  The appellant's
   position was that a letter from the bank confirming transfer of funds  in
   her favour could not be procured because the bank would  not  issue  one,
   but "it would work unfairness if this aspect of the Rules  were  insisted
   upon and indeed the current version of paragraph  245AA  makes  provision
   for such cases."  The respondent erred by failing to apply the June  2011
   version of evidential flexibility policy, and the judge  would  therefore
   have been bound to allow the appeal, irrespective of the error made.

12) Mr Matthews drew attention to a mistake by the judge at paragraph  2  of
   the determination.  The respondent had not been supplied with the further
   evidence which the appellant produced.  He  next  pointed  out  that  the
   letter in this case says more  than  once  that  the  decision  has  been
   reached "in line with published guidance" as well as with the Rules.   No
   inference could be to the contrary.  The shortcomings of the  information
   initially provided by the appellant in this case  were  considerable,  as
   set out in  the  first  box  of  the  decision.   There  was  nothing  in
   evidential flexibility policy or in paragraph 245AA  which  required  the
   respondent to seek further information from the appellant.   This  was  a
   case of plainly  inadequate  documentation,  not  errors  of  formatting.
   There was no letter from the  bank  and  nothing  to  suggest  that  such
   evidence existed.  The decision reached by the First-tier Tribunal should
   be reversed.

13)  Mr  Caskie  submitted  that  although  there  was  error  of  law,  the
   respondent did not now seek to  dispute  that  the  appellant  ultimately
   succeeded in showing the merits  of  her  case.   Any  shortcomings  were
   therefore only technical and procedural, and should  not  be  allowed  to
   stand in the way of a good business application.  He  drew  attention  to
   the decision letter at page 1 saying that the decision was reached "under
   the Immigration Rules" - full stop.   Paragraph 245AA made allowances for
   specified documents submitted in the wrong format.  Two of the  documents
   here disclosed such formatting issues.  There  was  a  complaint  that  a
   document did not have the appellant's signature.   That  meant  that  the
   document was acceptable other than the absence  of  the  signature.   The
   document was sourced from the appellant's team member, and did  not  have
   any need for her signature other than the imposition of  the  requirement
   in the Rules.  In other words, it was a minor  technical  and  formatting
   requirement only.  The team member was the appellant's  business  partner
   and provider of  the  letter  which  accompanied  her  application.   Any
   reasonable Secretary of State would  have  seen  that  the  letter  could
   readily be signed by the appellant as required.  There was also  omission
   of a lawyer's letter, but that was only a formal validation process.  The
   Secretary of State could only reasonably have proceeded on the basis that
   such a letter could be made available.  This  was  an  arbitrary  hurdle,
   which could be overcome simply by the appellant giving  evidence  of  her
   identify for money laundering purposes to  her  solicitors.   As  to  the
   absence of the bank letter, the appellant's team member was providing the
   funds, and this was another document which could easily  be  provided  on
   his instructions.  The judge had readily  concluded  that  the  appellant
   with her further evidence "ticked all the boxes".  The original  decision
   was not in  accordance  with  the  law,  because  although  the  decision
   referred to policy, it did not  state  which  of  the  respondent's  1200
   policy documents were relevant.  That  amounted  to  a  failure  to  give
   reasons.  There was no point in remitting to the Secretary of  State  for
   further decision, because the appellant had shown that she could meet all
   requirements.  The  Upper  Tribunal  should  substitute  a  determination
   allowing the appeal against the respondent's decision for  being  not  in
   accordance with the law, and directing that leave be granted.

14) Mr Matthews in reply submitted  that  the  reference  at  page  1  to  a
   decision in accordance with the Rules was accurate  -  all  decisions  of
   this nature are made under the  Rules.   That  did  not  imply  that  the
   guidance was not considered.  The further detailed terms of the  decision
   showed that guidance had been considered.  There did not  have  to  be  a
   specific reference,  it  being  obvious  that  this  meant  the  relevant
   published guidance.  The absence of a  signature  was  not  a  formatting
   defect, but non-compliance with a basic requirement.  The omission  of  a
   letter from a legal representative was not a  mere  technicality.   Money
   laundering checks were an important requirement.  There was no reason for
   the Secretary of State to assume that the appellant could put  right  all
   the apparent deficiencies.



15) Finally, Mr Caskie said that although the Presenting  Officer  presented
   a money laundering check as an important requirement, all a solicitor had
   to do was take a copy  of  a  passport  and  a  household  bill  from  an
   appellant.  Those were items which the Secretary of  State  already  had.
   His source for  the  respondent  having  a  total  of  1200  respondent's
   policies was ILPA (the Immigration Law  Practitioners'  Association).   A
   reader could not be asked simply to trust the respondent to  have  looked
   at the correct policy.

16) I reserved my determination.

17) The arguments for  the  appellant  are  ingenious,  but  they  take  the
   latitude available to the appellant under paragraph 245AA and flexibility
   policy too far.

18) As  put  at  paragraph  44  of  Rodriguez,  the  Immigration  Rules  are
   uncompromising in their stipulations,  in  particular  in  requiring  the
   specified documents to be lodged with  the  application.   The  Court  in
   Rodriguez  acknowledged  that  policy  and  paragraph  245AA  sought   to
   alleviate results which could in some cases be  viewed  as  unduly  harsh
   (paragraph 45) but the  question  was  how  far  the  respondent  obliged
   herself to go.  In Rodriguez the decision bore to have  been  made  under
   the Rules "and the Tier 4 policy guidance".  I  do  not  agree  that  the
   respondent in this case had to cite the guidance any  more  specifically.
   The reference was enough for it to be known that  guidance  applied,  and
   for that guidance to be identified.

19) As put in Rodriguez at paragraph 92, the guidance is  "demonstrably  not
   designed to give an applicant the opportunity first to remedy any  defect
   or inadequacy in the application or supporting  documentation  so  as  to
   save the application from refusal after substantive consideration."  I do
   not think  the  omissions  in  this  case  were  all  minor,  procedural,
   technical and obviously capable of rectification.  That asks the Tribunal
   to assume that the Rules impose several pointless requirements.  Nor  can
   the deficiencies be put under the heading of formatting.   The  appellant
   was not entitled to expect  that  on  the  several  deficiencies  in  her
   application, the respondent was bound to make assumptions in her favour.

20) Paragraph 100 of Rodriguez quotes with approval what  Sullivan  LJ  said
   in Alam [2012] EWCA Civ 960 at paragraph 45:

    The appellants were simply at fault  in  not  supplying  the  specified
    documents with their applications.  I endorse the view expressed by the
    Upper Tribunal in Shahzad ...  that  there  is  no  unfairness  in  the
    requirement  in  the  PBS  that  an  applicant  must  submit  with  his
    application all of the evidence  necessary  to  demonstrate  compliance
    with the Rule ... the Immigration Rules, the policy  guidance  and  the
    prescribed application form all  make  it  clear  that  the  prescribed
    documents must be submitted with the application and if they  are  not,
    the application will be rejected.  The price  of  securing  consistency
    and predictability is a lack of flexibility that  may  well  result  in
    "hard" decisions in individual cases, but that is not  a  justification
    for imposing an obligation on the  Secretary  of  State  to  conduct  a
    preliminary  check  of  all  applications  to  see  whether  they   are
    accompanied by all the specified documents, to contact applicants where
    this is not the case, and to give them an  opportunity  to  supply  the
    missing documents.  Imposing such an application would  not  only  have
    significant resource implications, it would also extend the time  taken
    by the decision making process, contrary to the policy  underlying  the
    introduction of the PBS.


21) This is perhaps  an  example  of  such  a  "hard"  case.   Although  not
   mentioned in submissions, I see that the appellant stated to  the  First-
   tier Tribunal in a letter of 9 August 2013 that her partner, Mr Long Lin,
   had his visa application granted until 14 June  2016.   That  may  be  an
   anomalous result, but  it  is  not  one  for  the  Tribunal  to  correct.
   Discretion in the matter does not arise from the Rules  or  from  policy,
   and remains a matter entirely for  the  respondent  -  2002  Act  section
   86(6).

22) The  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
   appellant's appeal, as originally brought to the First-tier Tribunal,  is
   dismissed.
