                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Bangladesh born on 8th  March  1987.
    He first arrived in the UK on 9th  December  2012  when  he  was  given
    limited leave to enter as a visitor for the purpose of  marriage  until
    26th May 2013. The Appellant applied for leave to remain on  the  basis
    of his subsequent  marriage.  That  application  was  refused  for  the
    reasons given in a Notice of Decision dated 12th  June  2013.   At  the
    same time it was decided to remove  the  Appellant  under  the  amended
    provisions of Section 47 Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act  2006.
    The Appellant appealed, and his appeal was heard by Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Emerton (the Judge)  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  14th
    January 2014.  He decided to allow the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on Article 8 ECHR  grounds  for  the  reasons  given  in  his
    Determination dated 17th January 2014.  The Respondent sought leave  to
    appeal that decision,  and  on  4th  April  2014  such  permission  was
    granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. According to the Notice of Decision, the  Appellant's  application  for
    leave to remain was  refused  under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  R-
    LTRP.1.1 of Appendix FM of HC 395 because the Appellant had  failed  to
    show  that  he  satisfied  the  maintenance  requirements  set  out  in
    paragraph E-LTRP.3.1.  This was because the specified  evidence  showed
    that the Sponsor had an income from employment of �15,414.56 per annum,
    and �1,635 from self-employment.  This gave a total of �17,049.56 which
    was less than the required amount of �18,600.  Further, the  Notice  of
    Decision stated that the Appellant did not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM, nor of paragraph 276ADE of HC 395.

 4. According to the Determination, the Judge allowed  the  appeal  on  the
    basis of a  different  calculation  of  the  Sponsor's  income.   Those
    calculations are set out in  paragraphs  19  to  21  inclusive  of  the
    Determination.  Using a period of twelve  months  up  to  the  date  of
    decision, the Judge found that the Sponsor had an income of  �12,874.92
    from employment and �6,565 from  self-employment,  making  a  total  of
    �19,439.92 which figure is in excess of the required figure of �18,600.
     Further, the Judge allowed the appeal on  Article  8  grounds  on  the
    basis that the Appellant qualified for leave to remain.

 5. At the hearing, Ms Pal argued that  the  Judge  had  erred  in  law  in
    calculating the Sponsor's income as he had used an incorrect period  of
    time.  According to  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  the
    Appellant was required to submit specified documents showing income for
    the twelve month period up to the date of application.  The  Judge  had
    therefore erred in law by making calculations  according  to  a  twelve
    month period up to the date of decision.  If  the  correct  period  had
    been used, the self-employed income of the Sponsor,  applying  Appendix
    FM-SE of the Immigration Rules, would have produced an income  of  only
    �2,245.   The  Judge  had  calculated  the  Sponsor's   earnings   from
    employment to amount  to  �13,124.52,  and  taking  these  two  figures
    together, the Sponsor's income fell well short of that  required.   The
    Judge should therefore have dismissed the appeal.

 6. Finally, Ms Pal submitted that the  Judge  had  erred  in  law  in  his
    assessment of the Appellant's Article 8 rights as he had done so on the
    basis that the Appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 7. In response, Mr Hossain conceded  that  in  calculating  the  Sponsor's
    income the Judge had erred in law as explained by Ms Pal.   However  he
    argued that the Judge had not erred in law in allowing the appeal under
    Article 8.  It was not disputed that the Appellant had  a  family  life
    with his wife in the UK.

 8. I find an error of law in the Judge's  decision  to  allow  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.  It is now agreed between the parties that
    the Judge used a wrong  period  of  time  in  order  to  calculate  the
    Sponsor's earnings and I so find.  This is a material error because had
    the correct period been used, the Sponsor's earnings  would  have  been
    insufficient to cross the threshold required by paragraph E-LTRP.3.1 of
    Appendix FM.

 9. Having allowed the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  it  is  no
    surprise that the Judge also allowed  the  appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds, but  in  so  doing  he  again  erred  in  law  by  finding  it
    "uncontroversial that removal would be disproportionate" on  the  basis
    that the Appellant qualified for leave to remain.

10. I therefore set aside both the decisions of  the  Judge  to  allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and also on Article 8 ECHR  grounds.
    I proceeded to remake those decisions.

Remade Decision

11. I was asked to remake the  decisions  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    contained  in  the  file.   I  heard  further  submissions  from   both
    representatives.  Ms Pal did not want to add to what  she  had  already
    said concerning maintenance, but as regards Article 8, she referred  me
    to the contents  of  the  Refusal  Letter  dated  12th  June  2013  and
    submitted that there were no  arguably  good  grounds  allowing  me  to
    consider  if  there  were  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised under the Immigration  Rules  to  consider  the  Appellant's
    Article 8 rights.

12. In response,  Mr  Hossain  argued  that  now  it  was  known  that  the
    Appellant's wife was in the advanced stages of pregnancy, the Appellant
    could meet the requirements  of  paragraph  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  and
    therefore the appeal should be allowed on human rights grounds.

13. It is now not in dispute that on a correct calculation of the Sponsor's
    available income, the Sponsor  had  insufficient  income  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules  and  therefore  I  dismiss  the
    appeal made under those Rules accordingly.

14. As regards Article 8, the bare facts, which are  not  in  dispute,  are
    that the Appellant arrived in the UK on 9th December 2012 in  order  to
    marry his wife, the Sponsor.  They marred on 28th  January  2013  since
    when they have lived together at the home of the Sponsor's mother.  The
    Sponsor is a British citizen who was born in the UK on 13th April 1993.
     She is now pregnant and is expected to be delivered of  her  child  on
    21st July 2014.

15. On this evidence I must find that the Appellant cannot  rely  upon  the
    exception contained in paragraph EX.1.(b) of Appendix  FM,  bearing  in
    mind the decision in Sabir (Appendix  FM  -  EX.1  not  free  standing)
    [2014] UKUT 00063 (IAC).  There was no evidence before  me  that  there
    were any insurmountable obstacles to family life between the  Appellant
    and the Sponsor continuing outside the UK.  That being the case, I find
    that there are no compelling circumstances in  this  case  which  might
    persuade me  that  leave  to  remain  should  be  granted  outside  the
    Immigration Rules under the provisions of Article 8 ECHR.

16. I therefore dismiss the appeal.

Decision

17. The making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on Article 8 ECHR grounds did involve the  making
    of an error on a point of law.

18. I set aside both decisions.

19. I remake those decisions in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

20. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005  and  I
    find no reason to make such an order.
