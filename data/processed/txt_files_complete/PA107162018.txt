For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Mensah
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 7th February 2019.

 2. Mr Diwnycz accepted that the decision could not stand.

 3. The appellant claimed that he is an Iranian of  Kurdish  ethnicity  who
    had helped his father in the KDPI cause.  The judge found  his  account
    of having delivered leaflets for  them  to  be  not  credible  and  she
    dismissed the appeal.

 4. Mr Diwnycz accepted that in doing so she  did  not  take  into  account
    country guidance case  of  HB  Kurds  Iran  CG  [2018]  UKUT  00430  in
    assessing the plausibility of  the  appellant's  case  and  the  likely
    treatment which he might face upon a return to Iran which is  an  error
    of law.

 5. Furthermore he accepted that her credibility findings were  unsafe,  in
    that she had failed to give adequate reasons for  concluding  that  the
    appellant was not illiterate as he  claimed  and  had  wrongly  applied
    Section 8 of the 2004 Act in terms of the  appellant's  travel  through
    Europe and his failure to claim asylum there when he was a minor.

 6. Finally the judge did not resolve a dispute between the parties, namely
    the effect of the appellant's online activity.

 7. Her decision is set aside.  All parties  agreed  that  the  credibility
    findings would have to be remade and therefore that the  appeal  should
    be reheard and remitted in the First-tier Tribunal  by  a  judge  other
    than Judge Mensah.

No anonymity direction is made.
