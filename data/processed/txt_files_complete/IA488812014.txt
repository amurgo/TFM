Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Nasim, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  21st  September  1987.
    The Appellant first entered the United Kingdom on  6th  September  2010
    with entry clearance conferring leave to enter until 30th January  2012
    as a student.  That leave was extended to 16th February 2014 as a  Tier
    1 (Post-Study) Migrant.  On 14th February 2014  the  Appellant  made  a
    combined application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system (PBS),  and
    for a biometric residence permit (BRP).  That application  was  refused
    by the Secretary of State on 2nd December 2014 on the  basis  that  the
    Secretary of State was not satisfied on the  balance  of  probabilities
    that the Appellant genuinely intended and was able to  establish,  take
    over or become a director of one or more businesses within the next six
    months and that the Appellant genuinely intended to  invest  the  money
    referred to in table 4 of Appendix A in the Immigration  Rules  in  the
    Appellant's business or businesses.  The Notice of Refusal set out  the
    basis upon which doubt  was  cast  on  the  authenticity  of  contracts
    entered into by the Appellant as set out at page 3  of  the  Notice  of
    Refusal.

 2. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal James sitting at Hatton Cross on 16th July  2015.   In  a
    decision promulgated on 24th  July  2015  the  Appellant's  appeal  was
    allowed.

 3. On 4th August 2015 the Secretary of State lodged Grounds of  Appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.  It was contended therein that the judge had made a
    material error of law in finding that paragraph 245DD(h)  and  (i)  did
    not apply where the applicant had already set up  a  business  and  was
    relying on access to �50,000 under table 4(d) of Appendix  A.   Further
    it was contended that whether the  Appellant  was  applying  under  the
    �200,000 or �50,000 category the genuine entrepreneur test would  apply
    and that there had been no consideration of the substantive reasons for
    refusal and therefore the failure to correctly apply paragraph 245DD(h)
    was material.

 4. On 3rd  December  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Robertson  granted
    permission to appeal.  He noted that it was arguable  as  submitted  in
    the grounds of application that the provisions of paragraph 245DD(h) in
    fact applied to all applications and the judge had misdirected  himself
    because he may have misinterpreted the provisions  of  that  paragraph.
    On 26th January i.e. one day before the hearing by  fax  the  Appellant
    responded pursuant to Rule 24 of the Upper  Tribunal  Procedure  Rules.
    The content  therein  is  of  considerable  relevance  as  is  set  out
    hereinafter.

 5. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Although this is an appeal by  the  Secretary  of
    State for the purpose of continuity throughout the  appeal  process  Mr
    Aziz is referred to hereinafter as the Appellant and the  Secretary  of
    State as the Respondent.   The  Appellant  appears  by  his  instructed
    Counsel Mr Nasim.  Mr Nasim is  extremely  familiar  with  this  matter
    having appeared before the First-tier Tribunal and by  also  being  the
    author of the Rule 24 response.  The Secretary of State appears by  her
    Home Office Presenting Officer Mr Walker.

The Rule 24 Response

 6. Mr Nasim takes me through his Rule 24 response pointing out that it was
    very likely that the author of the  Grounds  of  Appeal  did  not  have
    access to the bundles of both the Appellant and Respondent at the  time
    of drafting the application for permission to appeal.  He refers me  in
    particular to paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Rule 24 response  pointing  out
    that it shows which documents were before the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    and that the judge was correct in his analysis of the  bundle  and  the
    fact that  the  Appellant  did  have  an  existing  business  that  was
    operating and consequently  the  issue  of  findings  on  funding  were
    correct.  He points  out  the  claimant  had  already  established  the
    business that he was supplying in  the  �50,000  category  having  been
    granted leave to remain as a Post-Study Work  Migrant  and  relying  on
    category D in table 4 of Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   He
    points out that the judge does not state that paragraph  245DD(h)  does
    not apply to the claimant as the grounds assert but rather  it  is  the
    wrong provision of paragraph 245DD that  has  been  considered  by  the
    Secretary of State.  He submits the judge did look  at  the  claimant's
    ability to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  as  she  was
    correctly of the view that the basis upon  which  the  application  was
    considered was wrong in law.  Further he points out that the Respondent
    had awarded the claimants all the points under Appendix A, B and  C  of
    the Immigration Rules and accepted that  the  claimant  had  access  to
    �50,000 and consequently the refusal on that basis was irrational.   He
    points out that the Secretary of State had  awarded  all  the  relevant
    points under  Appendix  A  relating  to  Attributes  in  that  she  was
    satisfied that: -

      a) the claimant had continuously engaged in business activity;

      b) that the claimant was registered as a director of  a  new  business
         with Companies House;

      c) that the claimant had continuously been working  in  an  occupation
         which was above level 4 of NQF;

      d) the claimant had access to �50,000.

    In such circumstances he submits that there were no material errors  of
    law whatsoever and he asked me to  dismiss  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal.

 7. I am very substantially assisted by Mr Walker in this matter.   He  has
    given due consideration to the documents that were  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  He acknowledges that the submissions made by  Mr  Nasim
    and  set  out  in  the  Rule  24  response  are  correct  and  in  such
    circumstances whilst he has no instruction to withdraw  the  appeal  he
    does acknowledge that there is merit in what is said on the Appellant's
    behalf.

The Law

 8.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

 9. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

10. It is clear from the documents produced which Mr  Nasim  has  carefully
    taken me through, the submissions set out in the Rule 24  response  and
    the concessions made by Mr Walker that the  judge  fully  and  properly
    considered the evidence and the appropriate Immigration Rule  and  made
    findings of fact which she was entitled to.  In such circumstances  the
    decision discloses no material error of  law  and  the  appeal  of  the
    Secretary of State is dismissed and  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is maintained.
