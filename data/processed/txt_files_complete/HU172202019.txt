For the Appellant:     Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Cox, of Latta & Co, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Parties are as above, but the rest of this decision refers to  them  as
    they were in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD appeals, on 4 grounds, against the decision of FtT Judge David
    C Clapham, which at [38] allowed the appellant's  appeal  because  "the
    public  interest  in  the  deportation  of   foreign   criminals"   was
    "outweighed by the circumstances relied upon by the  appellant  in  his
    human rights appeal".


 3. Part 5A of the 2002 Act directs courts and tribunals  on  how  to  deal
    with article 8 of the ECHR and public interest considerations.  Section
    117C  states  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving  foreign
    criminals:

         (1)      The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
         interest.


         (2)      The more serious the offence committed by a foreign
         criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of the
         criminal.


         (3)      In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
         public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
         Exception 2 applies.


         (4)      Exception 1 applies where-


             (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for
             most of C's life,


             (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
             Kingdom, and


             (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's
             integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
             deported.


         (5)      Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.


         (6)      In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
         interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
         2.


         (7)      The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be
         taken into account where a court or tribunal is considering a
         decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the
         reason for the decision was the offence or offences for which the
         criminal has been convicted.


 4. The appellant was sentenced to 4 ï¿½ years, so it  would  not  have  been
    sufficient to make out one or both exceptions.   The  correct  approach
    would be to deal with  those  on  the  way  to  considering  everything
    relevant to "very compelling circumstances".

 5. Grounds 1 is absence of consideration of section 117C and its case law.

 6. Ground 2 is inadequate consideration of the public interest.

 7. Ground 3 says that the judge identified 3  points  in  the  appellant's
    favour: his relationship with his daughter; his length of time  in  the
    UK; and the length of time since his release from prison; and that even
    in combination, those were insufficient.  It is also said that  absence
    of enforcement of deportation should not have counted in his favour.

 8. Ground 4 is headed "perversity".  It begins by saying that the decision
    "verges on the perverse" but goes on to say that it was "clear that the
    appellant falls foul of section 117C(6)" and it was "not  open  to  the
    judge to find otherwise" (in which case, the outcome would have  to  be
    reversed).

 9. I am obliged to both representatives for  their  succinct  and  helpful
    submissions.

10. Mr Tan's submissions were along the lines of the grounds,  although  he
    did not press ground 4.  He also suggested that the FtT  erred  by  not
    giving weight  to  the  determination  of  the  FtT  in  DA/00415/2013,
    promulgated on 4 February 2014, dismissing a  previous  appeal  by  the
    appellant.

11. Mr Cox expanded upon his written submissions.  He argued that  although
    the judge did not cite the legal tests, he had been directed to them in
    submissions, and had applied them; he had regard to the public interest
    and was entitled to find it reduced to the extent that  he  did;  there
    were matters capable of amounting to very compelling circumstances; the
    decision was accordingly open to the judge and was  not  perverse;  and
    any error was not material.  As to the previous determination,  Mr  Cox
    countered that the point was novel, and late.

12. I reserved my decision.

13. The judge when reaching his conclusions did not  mention  the  previous
    determination, to which his attention was drawn; but he did  record  at
    [30] the submission that circumstances had moved on since  2014  (which
    might be said to be the nub of the case).  Taking account of that,  and
    in absence of any ground of appeal, I detect no error in this respect.

14. The obvious way to approach the decision was in terms of the  statutory
    criteria: (i) were there very significant obstacles to the  appellant's
    integration in Zimbabwe; (ii) would the effect of  deportation  on  his
    wife or daughter be unduly harsh; and,  critically,  (iii)  were  there
    very compelling circumstances over and above those two matters?

15. Despite Mr Cox's valiant submissions to the contrary, I  consider  that
    the judge erred by failing to make that structure overt (ground 1).   I
    accept that a decision should not  be  set  aside  for  want  of  legal
    recitals if  the  correct  test  has  effectively  been  applied.   The
    question is whether this was an error of form only, or of substance.

16. Ground 2 is not made out.  The judge  paid  careful  attention  to  the
    public interest - see [33, 34, and 36].

17. The appellant came from Zimbabwe to the UK in 2000 at the age of 12 and
    has lived here since then.  He has relatives in Zimbabwe.  It would  be
    a major and unwelcome change for him to have to integrate there, but it
    is plain that the judge, without  saying  so,  did  not  consider  that
    obstacles in his  way  reached  the  level  of  the  legal  test.   The
    appellant does not appear to have pressed such a contention in the FtT,
    and he did not do so in the UT.  Exception 1 was not made  out  (it  is
    perhaps unlikely  that  any  judge  would  have  found  that  it  was).
    However, the extent of any obstacles to integration  could  still  play
    some part in the ultimate test.

18. From [35] of the decision it is equally plain that the  judge  did  not
    find exception 2 to be made out in respect  of  the  appellant's  wife.
    Again, that is unsurprising.  As to his daughter, the judge did not say
    that the effect of deportation on her would be "unduly harsh",  but  he
    found  that  she  would  remain   here,   would   "suffer   significant
    consequences" through being deprived of her father's presence, and that
    this was a matter on which it was appropriate to "place  weight".   The
    judge should  have  been  explicit  in  terms  of  the  "unduly  harsh"
    criterion; but in the ultimate test, the consequences for his  daughter
    weighed a great deal.

19. The matters cited by the judge at [33 - 39] in favour of the appellant,
    as well as his relationship with his daughter, are the  reduced  weight
    to be given to the public interest with the passage of time; the length
    of time the appellant has been in the UK; the change  in  his  personal
    circumstances; "a real effort to change the direction of his  life  ...
    trying to be a useful member of society," low risk of re-offending; and
    the length of time since his release from prison.

20. While the challenge on grounds of perversity was not  abandoned,  I  do
    not find that it has been established.  I do not accept that the points
    on which the judge founded were incapable of producing  a  decision  in
    the appellant's favour.  There was much to weigh on both sides; but the
    appellant's circumstances had changed a great deal  since  he  incurred
    his convictions as a member of a vicious criminal gang, and  since  the
    previous determination.

21. Grounds 3 and 4 are not established.

22. I conclude that only ground 1 discloses  error,  and  that  on  a  full
    reading of the decision, this  is  a  lapse  of  form  rather  than  of
    substance.

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

24. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
