                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Dipnarian, instructed by Duncan Lewis
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    David Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is treated  as  a  national  of  China.    Following  the
    unchallenged findings of Judge Archer in the  First-tier  Tribunal  she
    must be regarded as a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution
    there.

 2. In the First-tier Tribunal the  Secretary  of  State  had  opposed  her
    appeal on Refugee Convention grounds on the basis  that  she  could  be
    returned to India.  The judge accepted that  argument.   The  appellant
    has permission to appeal to this Tribunal.

 3. Before us, Mr Mills told us that the Secretary  of  State  now  accepts
    that the Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC  requires  her  to  make  a
    grant of refugee status to the appellant.  That is to all  intents  and
    purposes, a concession of the appeal.

 4.  We  set  aside  the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    substitute  a  determination  allowing  the  appeal.   We  direct   the
    Secretary of State to grant the  appellant  refugee  status  under  the
    Qualification Directive.
