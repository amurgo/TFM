Representation:
For the Appellant:      Ms Khan, Counsel
For the Respondent:     Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  I
make an anonymity order.  Unless the Tribunal or a Court directs  otherwise,
no report of these proceedings or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
directly or indirectly identify  the  original  appellant.   This  direction
applies to, amongst others, all parties.  Any failure to  comply  with  this
direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.



      1. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia.  He has made an asylum claim
         and I have made an anonymity direction for this reason.

Procedural history

      2. In a decision promulgated on 10 July 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge
         Herwald dismissed the appellant's appeal on asylum and human rights
         grounds.  The judge did not accept that the appellant faced a  real
         risk of persecution  in  Somalia.   He  also  did  not  accept  the
         credibility of the asserted relationship between the appellant  and
         his spouse, and their children.

      3. In grounds seeking permission to appeal it was submitted  that  the
         judge failed to give  sufficient  reasons  for  not  following  the
         guidance  in  AMM  and  others  (conflict;   humanitarian   crisis;
         returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011] UKUT 00445 (IAC)  and  failed  to
         consider the documentary evidence when  making  findings  regarding
         the appellant's family life.

      4. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Coker  on
         the basis that it was considered to  be  arguable  that  there  was
         insufficient background evidence  available  to  Judge  Herwald  to
         enable him to depart from AMM.

      5. The SSHD has submitted a rule 24 response in which it is  submitted
         that the judge's findings were open to him.

      6. The matter now comes before me to  determine  whether  or  not  the
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
         law.

Hearing

      7. At the hearing Ms Khan relied upon the grounds of appeal.  She also
         submitted  that  the  judge  failed  to  carefully  scrutinise  the
         documentary evidence available before  making  adverse  credibility
         findings.  Mr Harrison agreed that the judge  had  erred  in  these
         respects.  I agree with the submissions  of  both  representatives.
         As Mr Harrison has conceded that  the  decision  contains  material
         errors of law, I have set out my reasons for  allowing  the  appeal
         briefly below.

      8. Both representatives agreed  that  findings  of  fact  need  to  be
         entirely remade and these will  need  to  address  the  appellant's
         likely circumstances in Somalia as well as his family life  in  the
         UK.  Both representatives agreed that such a hearing is  likely  to
         take ï¿½ a day and  in  the  circumstances  it  was  appropriate  and
         proportionate for the matter  to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal for findings to be remade de novo.   Both  representatives
         also agreed to the directions I set out below.



Discussion

Asylum

      9. The judge was entitled to find  that  there  had  been  significant
         changes to the situation in Somalia such that there were aspects of
         AMM that no longer represented the current position.  The  evidence
         on the reduced role of Al Shabab was clearly set out in the  SSHD's
         decision letter and in the absence of any  other  country  evidence
         the judge was entitled to rely on this.  The judge  however  failed
         to set out which aspects of AMM had been affected by  the  relevant
         changes and which had not.  AMM is a very  detailed  decision  (655
         paragraphs) with a lengthy headnote covering  an  array  of  issues
         relevant  to  the  complex  and  fluid  situation  in  Somalia,  of
         potential relevance to this appellant.  As  observed  in  the  more
         recent Somalia country guidance decision MOJ (Return to  Mogadishu)
         Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 (IAC) (which  postdates  the  decision
         under appeal) at [333] some of the country guidance in AMM  remains
         appropriate.

     10. In these circumstances it is difficult to understand how the  judge
         assessed risk on return for this  appellant  and  by  reference  to
         which background evidence.  The judge considered there was no  real
         risk to the appellant because he would have family and  /  or  clan
         protection but has not conducted an assessment of this by reference
         to any background evidence whatsoever.  The judge has clearly found
         it necessary to depart from AMM [18(e)] and  then  found  that  the
         appellant is not at risk [19]  but  has  failed  to  explain  which
         background evidence he has used in order to assess risk on  return.
         The SSHD's decision letter summarised the  contents  of  a  Danish-
         Norwegian fact-finding report from May 2013 but the judge  has  not
         indicated which background evidence he took into account as at  the
         date of hearing in July 2014.  I am  satisfied  and  the  SSHD  has
         conceded that this constitutes a material error of law.

Article 8

     11. It is clear that notwithstanding a  previous  positive  credibility
         finding the judge approached the appellant's case with a degree  of
         scepticism [10].  The judge did not accept that the  appellant  was
         in a relationship as claimed and  was  'not  persuaded'  he  had  a
         relationship with his (then two) children  [27].   The  judge  also
         appears to doubt the genuineness  of  the  biological  relationship
         between the appellant and the second child of the family  [37].   I
         accept Ms Khan's submission that in  reaching  these  findings  the
         judge  has  irrationally  failed  to  take  into  account  relevant
         evidence.  The judge has made no  mention  of  the  second  child's
         birth certificate which names him as father or  the  NHS  maternity
         documentation, which confirmed that his wife expected a third child
         on 1 August 2014 and he was named as the  father  with  whom  'full
         contact' was expected.  The evidence that the appellant already had
         a child with his spouse and that she was pregnant with another  was
         relevant to the claim that they were in a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship.

     12. In addition, the maternity documentation before the  judge  clearly
         demonstrated that the  appellant's  wife  spoke  English  and  used
         English when communicating about her medical care.  This calls into
         question the judge's misplaced assumption that she  did  not  speak
         English [36].  The judge has also assumed that the first  (British)
         child had no real links  to  Britain  and  could  relocate  to  her
         'homeland' without taking into account that she  was  born  British
         and was of school age and therefore clearly must have had links  to
         Britain as a result of this.

     13. I am satisfied and  the  SSHD  has  conceded  that  the  judge  has
         materially erred in law in assessing the appellant's family life.

Decision

     14. I find that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  an
         error of law and I set it aside.

Directions

     15. Both representatives agreed to the following directions:

          1) The appeal shall be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, which
             shall make fresh findings of fact having used the decision  of

             interpreter.

          2) The  appellant  shall  provide  the  respondent  with  updated

             and the circumstances of the  children  of  the  family  unit,
             together with evidence to confirm his relationship with  them,
             by 2 December 2015.

          3) The respondent shall provide the appellant with a  summary  of
             his position regarding the  appellant's  claimed  family  life

          4) The appellant shall file and serve a paginated indexed  bundle
             containing all evidence he wishes to rely upon 28 days  before
             the hearing.
