                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Turkington
    made following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 7th February 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on 5th June 1981.  He came to
    the UK as a visitor on 12th October 2011  stating  that  he  wanted  to
    visit his sister for two weeks.

 3. On 26th July 2012 he applied for leave to remain in order to  establish
    himself in business under the Turkey - European  Community  Association
    Agreement (the Ankara Agreement) which  contains  a  standstill  clause
    which means that the United  Kingdom  may  not  impose  conditions  for
    business applicants  less  favourable  than  were  in  force  when  the
    agreement came into being in 1973.

 4. The application was therefore assessed in accordance with paragraph  21
    of HC 510 which states as follows.

         "People admitted as visitors may  apply  for  the  consent  of  the
         Secretary of State to their establishing themselves  here  for  the
         purpose of setting up in business, whether on their own account  or
         as partners in a new or existing business.  Any such application is
         to be considered on its merits.  Permission will depend on a number
         of factors including evidence that the applicant will  be  devoting
         assets of his own to the business, proportional to his interest  in
         it, that he will be able to bear his share of any  liabilities  the
         business may incur, and that his  share  of  its  profits  will  be
         sufficient to support him and any dependants.  The applicant's part
         in the business must not amount to disguised employment and it must
         be  clear  that  he  will  not  have  to  supplement  his  business
         activities by employment for  which  a  work  permit  is  required.
         Where the applicant intends to join an existing  business,  audited
         accounts should be produced to establish  its  financial  position,
         together with a written statement of the terms on which  he  is  to
         enter into it; evidence should be sought that he will  be  actively
         concerned with its running and that there is a genuine need for his
         services and investment.  Where the  application  is  granted,  the
         applicant's stay may be extended for  a  period  of  up  to  twelve
         months on a condition restricting his freedom to  take  employment.
         A person admitted as a businessman in the  first  instance  may  be
         granted an appropriate extension of stay if the conditions set  out
         above are still satisfied at the end of the period for which he was
         admitted initially."

 5. The Appellant  proposed  to  set  up  himself  in  business  as  an  IT
    technician in North London.  He employed  a  firm  of  accountants,  AK
    Accounting, to devise a business plan and  they  produced  a  projected
    profit and loss account which estimated that in  year one the  business
    would generate sales of �39,000 and produce a net profit of �20,360.

 6. The Appellant gave oral  evidence  to  the  judge  about  the  proposed
    business.  The judge recorded  that  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant had shown that he had the necessary  skills  to  be  able  to
    establish a computer repair business in the UK and it was not  apparent
    from the business plan where the sales figure of �39,000 had come from.
     He did not accept that the Appellant could turn over such a figure  in
    a new business as a computer technician in a  competitive  market.   He
    noted that the Appellant had not provided  any  official  documentation
    from Turkey to support  his  employment  record  and  was  particularly
    concerned that, when he applied to come to the UK as a visitor, he  had
    described himself as a  paralegal  and  made  no  mention  of  being  a
    computer technician.

 7. He dismissed the appeal, concluding as follows:

         "I am satisfied that the  Appellant  has  the  necessary  financial
         resources to set up in business but I am  not  satisfied  that  the
         Appellant has carried out sufficient research in  order  to  ensure
         that the business is  viable  and  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
         proposed business, if it were to go forward, would be sufficient to
         support the Appellant in the UK.   I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
         evidence shows that there is a genuine need for the services of the
         Appellant  and  his  investment   as   a   self-employed   computer
         technician."

The Grounds of Application

 8. The Appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  in  grounds  which  were
    initially refused by Judge Frankish on 13th March 2013 but  granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 23rd April 2013.

 9. In summary, the grounds argue that the judge misdirected  himself  when
    stating that he was not satisfied  that  the  evidence  demonstrated  a
    genuine need for the services of the Appellant because the issue  of  a
    genuine need for services  is  only  relevant  when  the  applicant  is
    seeking to join an existing business and relates to whether or not that
    particular  business  requires  the  investment  and  services  of  the
    applicant.   It  is  not  applicable  to  sole  applicants  seeking  to
    establish a business as a sole trader.

10. Secondly, the judge misdirected himself in law  and  did  not  properly
    apply the Upper Tribunal decision in Akinci  (paragraph  21  HC  510  -
    correct approach) [2012] 00266 (IAC) which was not  considered  by  the
    Tribunal.

11. Paragraph 21 of Akinci states:

         "The  correct  approach  to  paragraph  21  of   HC   510   invites
         consideration of the following matters:

         (i)  The price for acquisition of a business should make commercial
             sense.  An exaggerated price or one which does not reflect  in
             any way  the  true  value  of  the  business  may  lead  to  a
             legitimate enquiry as to the truth of the transaction  or  the
             intentions of the parties.

         (ii) A business plan must be realistic, having regard to the nature
             of the enterprise.  It is legitimate to ask further  questions
             where the projected turnover  is  substantially  greater  than
             that reflected in the accounts of the business being acquired.



         (iii)    Even where a business is not expected to be profitable  in
             the short term, revenue generated may well be enough  to  meet
             short time liabilities and provide enough for the  applicant's
             support.

         (iv) It is important therefore to identify the  likely  liabilities
             and what the applicant's personal needs are in order to see if
             they can be met out of cash flow or  the  initial  investment.
             The test is not whether the applicant is going to get a return
             on his investment but whether what is projected is  likely  to
             enable the applicant to pay the bills  arising  and  meet  his
             living expenses.

         (v)  A plan is what it says it  is:  a  projection  of  how  it  is
             anticipated things will  work  out  with  the  possibility  of
             making adjustments as the business gets underway.  It is not a
             straightjacket.

         (vi) In doubtful cases, an  applicant's  previous  experience  will
             help inform the decision maker whether a projected turnover is
             likely  to  be  achieved,  but  such  experience  is   not   a
             prerequisite."

12. The Tribunal did not properly apply subparagraph (v)  of  Akinci.   The
    test is not whether the Appellant will make a return,  but  whether  he
    will be  able  to  cover  his  liabilities  and  bills.   His  list  of
    expenditure was modest. He had produced a price list, a  detailed  list
    of equipment required and a SWOT analysis which puts the business  plan
    in line with Akinci.

13. Thirdly, the judge  had  unreasonably  held  the  Appellant's  previous
    application  for  entry  clearance  against  him  because  he  had  not
    mentioned in that application  that  he  also  undertook  work  in  the
    computer repair field.  At the time, the Appellant did not know that he
    would be making an Ankara Agreement application  and  therefore  simply
    included his employment as a paralegal, which was granted regardless of
    including his  work  as  a  computer  repair  technician.  It  was  his
    entitlement to include information necessary at that time.

14. Fourthly, the judge had unfairly relied on matters not put  to  him  in
    drawing his adverse conclusions.  The Appellant had described a  number
    of modules within his degree and confirmed that what he had learned  in
    them had given him the requisite experience  to  establish  a  computer
    repair business.  The Tribunal asked no questions of him with regard to
    his skills and experience and had made adverse findings, flying in  the
    face of the unchallenged evidence given by him.  There was no basis  to
    conclude that the Appellant does not have the required  skills  and  no
    basis for speculating that he could not be a computer technician simply
    because he worked as a paralegal.

15. Finally, the judge did not apply the proper standard  of  proof,  which
    was not referred to in the determination.



Submissions

16. Mrs Peterson relied on her grounds and submitted that the judge did not
    undertake a proper analysis of whether the  Appellant  could  genuinely
    set up in business as  a  computer  technician.   There  was  extensive
    material before him in relation to his training in Turkey and the judge
    had unreasonably concentrated on the application for  entry  clearance.
    In any event the provisions of paragraph 21 were sparse, and  expertise
    was not a strict requirement.  The judge had not followed the spirit of
    those provisions and had paid undue attention to  unimportant  factors,
    not taking into account cogent evidence.

17. Mrs Peterson relied on four letters from previous employers  which  the
    Appellant had produced confirming that  he  had  acted  as  a  computer
    technician. Furthermore, the Appellant had not actually filled  in  the
    application for entry clearance himself.  She noted that  none  of  his
    qualifications referred to law even though he had worked for four legal
    firms. Moreover his temporary graduation certificate  dated  26th  July
    2004 from the Department of Industrial Automation following a two  year
    programme referred to his graduating with the title of "technician."

18. Given the unexacting nature of  the  provisions  of  paragraph  21  the
    appeal should be allowed on the basis of the  evidence  already  before
    us, or alternatively the matter could be reheard since  she  was  in  a
    position to take us to evidence demonstrating  that  the  business  was
    viable.

19. Ms Tanner defended the determination.  She submitted that the judge had
    applied the principles of Akinci even though he had not referred to the
    case  and  had  properly  assessed  whether  the  Appellant's  previous
    experience made it likely that his business plan was realistic or  not.



20. He had been quite correct to include in  his  assessment  the  evidence
    from the visit visa application forms.  At question 49,  the  Appellant
    had been asked to give details of any additional  jobs  or  occupations
    and he had replied "none".  He was now  seeking  to  rely  on  previous
    experience in Turkey, but the judge was entitled to observe that he had
    failed to provide any official documents of his employment.

21. She said that the judge had set  out  his  concerns  very  clearly,  in
    particular his doubts about where the turnover figure  had  come  from,
    and  had  made  a  sustainable  finding  that  there  was  no  rational
    provenance for the figures relied on by the Appellant.   There  was  no
    error in his overall conclusion that, even though he was satisfied that
    the Appellant  had  the  financial  resources,  he  did  not  have  the
    necessary abilities to set up the proposed business.

22. By way of reply Mrs Peterson repeated that the judge had  not  properly
    applied the ratio in Akinci. There was nothing wrong in  the  Appellant
    being optimistic as to what his sales would  be,  and  cogent  evidence
    before the judge that the business was viable.  He had identified three
    potential clients and had the financial resources to set  the  business
    up.  It was not the Tribunal's function to act as a bank  manager,  but
    to decide whether the Appellant was in a position to meet his  expenses
    without recourse to prohibited employment.   There  was  a  substantial
    body of evidence before the judge to show that he could.

Findings and Conclusions

23. It is right to acknowledge that the first ground is made  out  in  that
    the judge was wrong to refer to the question of  whether  there  was  a
    genuine need for the Appellant's services in his final sentence of  the
    determination. Such a requirement is only relevant when an Appellant is
    joining an existing business.

24. However, the  error  is  immaterial  because  the  judge  did  properly
    consider the application to set up a new business on its merits, as  he
    was required to do by Paragraph 21.  Ms Peterson is  wrong  to  suggest
    that such an exercise is  confined  to  the  question  of  whether  the
    Appellant had the requisite financial resources, since permission  will
    depend on a number of other factors.

25. The key requirement in Akinci, to which we accept  the  judge  was  not
    referred, is that:

         "A business plan must be realistic, having regard to the nature  of
         the enterprise."

26. The judge had clear  concerns  about  whether  the  business  plan  was
    realistic for the reasons which he gave.  He was  entitled  to  express
    some doubts as to the rational provenance of the figures produced by AK
    Accounting. There is nothing in the documentation which  justifies  the
    projected sales of �39,000.

27. The remaining grounds also amount  to  a  mere  disagreement  with  the
    decision.  The evidence before the judge was  that  the  Appellant  had
    denied having any additional job or occupation other than the full time
    employment, which he declared as a paralegal, in  his  application  for
    entry clearance as a visitor. Plainly that evidence was relevant to the
    issue of the Appellant's experience in computer technology in Turkey.

28. Mrs Peterson appeared to be arguing in her submissions that  the  judge
    had failed to take relevant  evidence  into  account,  and  cited  four
    letters from previous employers in Turkey stating  that  the  Appellant
    had acted as a computer technician.  However, those  letters  were  all
    considered by the judge at paragraph 15  of  the  determination.   None
    were relied on in his visitor visa application, nor did he declare  any
    income   from   those   additional   sources   in   that   application.
    Significantly, he had also failed to provide any official documentation
    to support his employment record. This is not therefore a  question  of
    the judge ignoring relevant evidence. He dealt with it and found it  to
    be unreliable for the reasons which he gave.

29. No reference was made in the submissions to grounds 4 and 5 which  have
    no merit.  The Appellant's evidence of his skills  and  experience  was
    not unchallenged. It was the central issue in the appeal. There was  no
    obligation on the judge to put  all  of  his  concerns  to  him.   With
    respect to the standard of proof, this is a very experienced judge  who
    would have been aware of the correct standard to be applied  and  there
    is no evidence in the determination that he did not do so.

30. Read as a whole this is a thorough and well-reasoned determination.  We
    conclude that the Appellant's grounds amount to a disagreement with the
    decision but disclose no error of law.

Decision

31. The original judge did not err in law and the decision stands.
