Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Harris of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Rwanda, born on 2  September  1986.   She
    made an application to vary her leave on 30 May 2012.  On 16 July  2013
    the respondent refused her application pursuant to  paragraph  319V  of
    the Immigration Rules  and  to  remove  her  pursuant  to  s47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal was allowed  by
    Judge Howard (the judge) in a determination promulgated on 24  February
    2014.  At an error of law hearing, I found that the appellant's failure
    to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules was relevant  to  the
    judge's Article 8 analysis in terms of Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640, Shahzad
    [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720  (Admin).   That  was
    because the new Rules set out what needed to be balanced in the  public
    interest which rendered the judge's assessment incomplete.  I found  as
    claimed in the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  that  the  judge  gave
    inadequate reasons for finding that the appellant's circumstances  were
    sufficiently compelling to show that there were arguably  good  grounds
    for consideration outside the Rules.   Further,  I  found  the  judge's
    Article 8 assessment inadequate at [30].  All  he  said  was  that  the
    appellant had not apparently been  a  burden  on  the  state,  she  had
    assisted her sister  and  that  the  only  way  family  life  could  be
    maintained would be by the siblings moving to Rwanda.

 3. I set aside the decision and the case was listed for hearing  with  the
    purpose of re-making the decision on 19 June 2014, when  the  appellant
    was represented by Mr A Khan of Counsel  and  Mr  Tarlow,  Senior  Home
    Office Presenting Officer.  The parties were advised to prepare for the
    hearing on the basis that  none  of  the  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal   should   stand.   Following   examination-in-chief,   cross-
    examination and submissions by Mr Tarlow, Mr Khan raised for the  first
    time that the appellant was relying upon paragraph 317 of  HC  395.   I
    adjourned the hearing at that stage and made directions  that  Mr  Khan
    file and serve his skeleton argument addressing  generally  the  issues
    for me to consider in re-making the determination and specifically  how
    or in what circumstances paragraph 317 of  the  Immigration  Rules  was
    relevant to  the  appellant's  appeal.   Mr  Khan  filed  his  skeleton
    argument on 7 July 2014 although it appears that it was not served upon
    the respondent.  Neither Ms Holmes nor Mr Harris  had  seen  Mr  Khan's
    skeleton argument such that  I  briefly  adjourned  to  give  them  the
    opportunity of considering the  same.   When  the  hearing  resumed  Mr
    Harris confirmed he was not relying upon paragraph 317.  As neither  Ms
    Holmes or Mr Harris had been present at the previous  hearing,  I  read
    them my note of the evidence.  I invited Mr Harris to consider  whether
    he wanted the appellant to give additional evidence, which he  told  me
    he did not consider  necessary.   He  was  content  to  rely  upon  the
    appellant's oral evidence before me on 19 June 2014 and her  bundle  of
    documents.

 4. The documentary evidence consisted of the respondent's and  appellant's
    bundles.  In the bundle  prepared  by  the  respondent  there  appeared
    copies of the notice of decision, a  letter  giving  reasons,  and  the
    notice of appeal. The  appellant's  solicitors  prepared  a  bundle  in
    readiness for the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  (also  relied
    upon  before  the  Upper  Tribunal)  and  included  statements  of  the
    appellant, her half sister Rita Stevenson and Tom Close.



The Appellant's Case

 5. The appellant's case emerged from her application,  witness  statements
    and submissions put to me  by  Mr  Harris.   The  appellant  said  Rita
    Stevenson was her full sister, however, Mr Harris conceded they are  in
    fact half sisters.  The appellant said her parents and other members of
    their  family  were  killed  in  the  Rwandan  War  of  1994  and   her
    grandmother, Josephine Mukantagara, Rita Stevenson  and  the  appellant
    were the only members of the family to  survive.   Rita  Stevenson  was
    brought up by  their  aunt  in  Burundi.  She  was  given  humanitarian
    protection in the United Kingdom in 2005.

 6. The appellant said that after her parents were killed, she  lived  with
    her grandmother.  They were living on the street, begging for money for
    food and water.  After a while her grandmother started to sell milk and
    earned money so that they could survive.   Her  grandmother's  business
    supported her through Primary School and High School between  1997  and
    2007.   When  the  appellant  finished  High  School  she  joined   her
    grandmother in the business and they  worked  together.   Nevertheless,
    the appellant said that they lived in fear at all times such  that  her
    grandmother planned to send her to the United Kingdom  to  study.   Her
    grandmother sold land in order to generate money  for  her  trip.   She
    said that whereas all  land  owned  by  the  Tutsi  minority  had  been
    previously confiscated,  when  President  Kagame  came  to  power,  her
    grandmother managed to reclaim her land which  she  subsequently  sold.
    The appellant said she left Rwanda on 10 February 2010 and went to live
    with Rita Stevenson in the United Kingdom.  The appellant said she  has
    no friends or family now in Rwanda.  She lives with Rita  Stevenson,  a
    single parent.  She has two children, Alpha aged 10 or thereabouts  who
    I was told has behavioural and anger problems and Ellah, 8  months  old
    or thereabouts who suffers from Downs Syndrome.  As Rita Stevenson owns
    a recruitment consultancy business, the appellant cares for Alpha.  The
    appellant said that her grandmother Josephine  Mukantagara went to live
    in Canada in December 2011 when she was already in the United  Kingdom.



 7. The respondent refused the appellant's application  giving  reasons  in
    her letter of  16 July  2013.   It  was  not  accepted  the  appellant
    satisfied the Immigration Rules which was conceded both by Mr Khan  and
    Mr Harris.  Nor was it accepted by the respondent that the  appellant's
    removal would breach her rights in respect of family  or  private  life
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.

Evidence

 8. The appellant adopted her statements, confirmed their truth  and  asked
    me to accept them in evidence.  She told me that she takes Alpha to and
    from school  and  helps  him  with  his  homework.   She  said  he  has
    behavioural and anger problems. That was  because  Rita  Stevenson  has
    little time for Alpha because her time  is  taken  up  with  Ellah  who
    suffers from Downs Syndrome.

 9. In cross-examination, the appellant said that her grandmother had  land
    and a business in Rwanda.  She sold some land in order to  provide  the
    ï¿½16,000  it cost to send the appellant to the  United  Kingdom.   Asked
    whether it was her intention to  study  here  when  she  entered  on  a
    student visa, the appellant replied in the negative.  She  just  wanted
    to come here.  She claimed Rita Stevenson was her full sister  but  did
    not challenge the DNA evidence that they are half sisters.

10. Rita Stevenson adopted her statement, confirmed its truth and asked  me
    to accept it in evidence.  She said that the appellant helped her  with
    childcare, in particular with Alpha as her own time is used up  in  her
    business and caring after Ellah who as well  as  suffering  from  Downs
    Syndrome, has a heart defect.  She said that  Social  Services  support
    would only be available for Ellah from age 3 onwards.   Ms  Stevenson's
    evidence was that the appellant's intention as she understood  it,  was
    to come to stay with her but also to study here.

Submissions

11. Mr Tarlow made submissions on 19 June. He  relied upon the reasons  for
    refusal.  He questioned the appellant's motives in coming to the United
    Kingdom.  She had conceded her intention was to come here to live  with
    her sister.  The student visa had been  used  as  a  vehicle  for  that
    purpose.  She was not a genuine student.  The appellant  left  her  own
    country as an adult.  She had  access  to  significant  sums  of  money
    there.  It might well be that she wanted to live with her sister in the
    United Kingdom and was helping  with  childcare  here,  but  there  was
    nothing between the women other than the  normal  emotional  ties.   If
    Rita Stevenson  needed  assistance  with  childcare,  then  alternative
    arrangements could be made and state  facilities  were  available.   Ms
    Holmes made no submissions on 19 August but adopted those  made  by  Mr
    Tarlow.

12. Mr Khan made no submissions on behalf of the appellant on 19 June.   Mr
    Harris did not provide a skeleton argument. Mr Harris asked me to  take
    into account the two particular aspects of the appellant's  case  which
    made  her  removal  disproportionate.   They   were   the   appellant's
    vulnerability in terms of her life experiences in Rwanda such that  the
    emotional support she receives from Rita Stevenson should be considered
    in terms of that vulnerability.  Further, the family  circumstances  in
    terms of Ellah and Alpha.  Rita Stevenson and her children benefit from
    the appellant's presence here.

Findings and Conclusions

13. In this appeal the burden lies with the appellant to  prove  the  facts
    and matters she relies upon.  Her case was advanced on the  basis  that
    she has established a family and private life  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since her arrival here in 2010 and that her removal in  consequence  of
    the respondent's decision would breach her rights under  Article  8  of
    the Human Rights Convention.  The  standard  of  proof  is  that  of  a
    balance of probabilities.  (See the determination in EH  (Iraq)  [2005]
    UKIAT 00065)





14. Article 8 of ECHR states:

    (i)  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,
         his home and his correspondence.

    (ii) There should be no interference by a  public  authority  with  the
         exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law
         and is necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interest  of
         national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing  of  the
         country,  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  or  crime,  for   the
         protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
         and freedoms of others.

15. The Court of Appeal has stated in a number of cases that the  threshold
    for establishing an interference with private or  family  life  is  not
    high.  AG (Eritrea) [2007] EWCA Civ 801.

16.  In applying Article 8, Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39 provides that it  is
    not just the applicant's family (or private)  life  that  needs  to  be
    taken into consideration but that of her family members too.

17. LD (Article 8 - best interests of child) Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT 278 (IAC)
    provided that the best interests of  children  have  to  be  a  primary
    consideration, meaning that they have to be considered first.   Broadly
    speaking, the best interests of the child mean  the  wellbeing  of  the
    child.  ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4.

18. In VW [2009] EWCA Civ 5 the Court of  Appeal  held  that  in  assessing
    proportionality and whether an appellant's family should return to  his
    country of  origin  with  him,  the  test  is  not  whether  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to prevent  their  going  but  whether  it  is
    reasonable  to  expect  them  to  go.   If  there  are   insurmountable
    obstacles, they will succeed but  if  there  are  not,  they  will  not
    necessarily fail.

19. At [128] of R (MM and Others) [2014] EWCA Civ 985 Aikens LJ  considered
    the relationship of Article 8 with the Immigration Rules and Strasbourg
    case law:

         "...... Nagre does not add anything to the  debate,  save  for  the
         statement that if a particular person is outside the Rule  then  he
         has to demonstrate, as a preliminary to a consideration outside the
         Rule, that he has an arguable case that there may be  good  grounds
         for granting leave to remain outside the Rules.  I cannot see  much
         utility in imposing  this  further,  intermediary,  test.   If  the
         applicant cannot satisfy the Rule, then there either is or there is
         not a further Article 8 claim ......"

20. And at [134]:

         "...... if the relevant group of IRs is not such a "complete  code"
         then the proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided
         by Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law."

21. Razgar remains relevant. See also Omotunde (Best Interests  -  Zambrano
    applied - Razgar) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00247 (IAC) with  regard  to  the
    appellant's family life with the children. In  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27
    Lord Bingham gave guidance at [17] as  to  the  correct  approach  when
    dealing with Article 8 as follows:

         "In considering whether a challenge to  the  Secretary  of  State's
         decision to remove a person must clearly fail, the reviewing  court
         must consider:

         (i)  Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or family life?

         (ii) If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

         (iii)    If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

         (iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interest of national security,  public  safety  or  the
             economic wellbeing of  the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, or the protection of health or  morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

         (v)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?"

22. In reaching my decision I have had regard to s19 of the Immigration Act
    2014 and to the considerations relevant to the  appellant  set  out  in
    s117. The appellant speaks English. She is not financially independent.



23. I  consider  the  appellant's  particular  circumstances.   I  consider
    whether family life exists in terms of Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31  and
    Salad [2002] UKIAT 06698. I accept that in  so  far  as  the  appellant
    currently lives with Rita Stevenson and helps with child  care,  family
    life exists.  As I have indicated  above  at  [15]  the  threshold  for
    establishing an interference is not high.

24. I consider s55 and the best interests of the  children.  The  appellant
    takes Alpha to and  from  school,  helps  him  with  his  homework  and
    addresses his behavioural and anger problems when they arise. I  accept
    that Alpha and his mother enjoy the appellant's  involvement  in  their
    lives. The appellant shares the childcare burden with her  half  sister
    and enables her to run  her  business.  The  documents  refer  to  Rita
    Stevenson suffering from hip pain but that was not  raised  before  me,
    nor was there any evidence to explain why it is that  the  hip  problem
    necessitates assistance from  the  appellant  and  the  extent  of  the
    assistance.

25. There was no credible evidence before me that Alpha is  suffering  from
    such behavioural or anger problems  that  necessitate  the  appellant's
    input or that such care as  she  provides  could  not  be  supplied  by
    another nanny or child-minder.

26. I do not accept that there is any credible evidence whether medical  or
    otherwise in terms of LD, ZH, or the various other cases regarding  the
    best interests of children and s55, to suggest  that  the  welfare  and
    best interests of Ellah and Alpha would be to live with  and  be  cared
    for by the appellant as well as their mother.  Ellah is  too  young  to
    need anyone but Mum; in any event,  her  father  has  contact  and  can
    provide assistance. I find the care the care the appellant provides for
    Alpha can be readily obtained from another child-minder or nanny; there
    is nothing to suggest otherwise.

27. I do not accept that there is any credible evidence of dependency  over
    and above the normal ties between the appellant and Rita Stevenson.  Mr
    Harris would  have  me  accept  that  the  appellant's  background  and
    experiences in Rwanda have made her more vulnerable, such that there is
    a degree of  dependency  upon  Rita  Stevenson  over  and  above  close
    emotional bonds, however, there was no credible evidence before  me  in
    that regard.

28. The appellant has been in the United  Kingdom  for  4  years.   She  is
    living with her half sister at the moment and helping  with  childcare,
    but she has not lived with her  continually since she came here. During
    2013, the appellant was  caring  for  the  children  of  Tom  Close  in
    Suffolk. I have taken his statement into account.

29. The appellant is a young  woman  in  good  health  who  has  lived  the
    majority of her life in her own country.  She would have me accept that
    she lived a traumatised life there  as  a  result  of  the  civil  war,
    however, on her own evidence, she and  her  grandmother  established  a
    business  of  some  success  and  their  assets  were  such  that   her
    grandmother was able to provide ï¿½16,000, a considerable  sum,  to  send
    the appellant to the United Kingdom. The appellant's evidence before me
    was that her grandmother had provided the ï¿½16,000 through the  sale  of
    land,  however  in  her  application  in  2012,   the   appellant   was
    inconsistent and said that she herself owned land which she sold.

30.  On the appellant's own evidence she did not come to the United Kingdom
    as a genuine student (see [9] above) although Rita Stevenson's evidence
    was inconsistent in that regard(see [10] above).

31.  There  was  no  credible  evidence  before  me  that  the  appellant's
    grandmother went to Canada from Rwanda in 2011 or if she  did  so,  the
    terms on which she entered and it is claimed, remains in that  country.
    I have not found the appellant to be a credible witness  regarding  her
    circumstances. See [9],[29] and  [30]  above.   I  do  not  necessarily
    accept that the appellant has no family or friends in  Rwanda  to  whom
    she could turn to for support on return but even if I am wrong in  that
    regard, I do not accept that it is unreasonable to expect the appellant
    to return to her own country to make her own way there.  She  made  her
    way in her own country,  rising  with  nothing  from  the  streets  and
    establishing a successful business; she can  do  so  again  on  return.
    There is no absolute right to enjoy family  and  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Contact can  continue  with  Rita  Stevenson  and  her
    children in whatever way is thought best.

32. The respondent would interfere lawfully with the appellant's family and
    private life  in  the  interests  of  the  maintenance  of  immigration
    control. The interference engages Article 8.  The  issue  must  be  the
    proportionality of the decision. Looking at the situation in the round,
    I find it proportionate given this particular appellant's circumstances
    to expect her to return to Rwanda.  I make that finding respecting  the
    balance between the public interest in maintaining immigration  control
    and the appellant's family and private life rights.  I find in terms of
    Razgar that  the  appellant's  circumstances  are  not  such  on  these
    particular facts to  demand  an  outcome  in  her  favour.   For  these
    reasons, the appeal is dismissed under Article 8 on my finding that the
    decision is lawful and necessary in the pursuit of the  legitimate  aim
    of immigration control and is a  proportionate  interference  with  the
    appellant's desire to pursue her family and private life rights in  the
    United Kingdom.

33. I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal.
