For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are Sooneeta Emrith and Raj Kumar  Emrith,  husband  and
    wife and  citizens of Mauritius.  The First Appellant was born on  13th
    July 1965 and her husband on 8th May 1965.   They  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State made on 8th November 2013 to  refuse
    to vary leave in the United Kingdom  and  to  remove  them  by  way  of
    directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.  Mrs Emrith is the principal Appellant  and  her  husband  is
    dependent on  her  appeal.   Initially  the  Appellants'  son,  Avishay
    Emrith, (appeal reference  IA/50781/2013), born on 21st  November  1995
    was also dependant on his mother's appeal.   At  the  hearing  on  11th
    December 2014 I was  advised  that  Avishay  Emrith  had  been  granted
    Italian citizenship and had therefore withdrawn his appeal.

 2. Following a hearing on 1st  April  2014  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    allowed all three appeals under the Immigration  Rules.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted and on 9th September 2014 having heard submissions I
    found that there was a material error of law in  the  determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal and I set that decision aside with no preserved
    findings of fact.

 3. Briefly the facts of this case are that the first Appellant arrived  in
    the UK on 26th October 2005 as a visitor together with her husband and
    son.  They were granted six months' leave to enter.  She  then  applied
    in time on 30th November 2005 for leave  as  a  student  and  this  was
    granted and then extended to 31st May 2011.  Leave  was  given  to  her
    husband and son as her dependents.  Her leave was curtailed because the
    college that she was attending had its licence revoked and she made the
    application for Indefinite Leave to Remain, the refusal of which is the
    subject of this appeal.   The Secretary of State  took  the  view  that
    there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  family  returning  to
    Mauritius.  At the time of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,
    Avishay Emrith had just finished school and was  awaiting  confirmation
    of a place at Loughborough University.  He had received  a  conditional
    offer of a place on a Bachelor of Engineering course. He  was  born  in
    Italy.  At the time of that hearing he did not have Italian citizenship
    but remained a Mauritian citizen.  The first Appellant has brothers  in
    Italy.  Her parents are dead.  She has a married sister  in  Mauritius.
    She said that she had leave to be in Italy and  was  granted  permanent
    residence. She was supposed to submit all her documents to the  Italian
    authorities but came here instead so could not return to  Italy.    Her
    husband works as a porter at a hospital in Croydon.  He has never  been
    in receipt of public funds and has no criminal  record.   They  have  a
    private life in the UK.

 4. Prior to the hearing I was given a bundle of documents  which  includes
    ID documents apparently issued in Italy with translations of  them.   I
    have to say the translation is very poor.  What it seems to say is that
    a residence permit for long term residence has a  deadline  after  five
    years and it then has to be updated.  It seems that the permits  issued
    to the Appellants were dated 3rd January 2008 and  21st December  2007
    respectively  so  they  would  have  expired  in  the  absence  of  the
    appropriate action by the Appellants.

 5. Mr Gokhool pointed out that evidence of earnings  by  the  parties  had
    been provided.  Mr Emrith earns �17,500 per annum and  his  wife  earns
    around  �10,000  per  annum.   They  therefore   meet   the   financial
    requirements of Appendix FM.   He  also  pointed  out  that  since  the
    Appellant's son is still financially dependent on them he will  not  be
    able to go to university without their  financial  support  which  they
    will not be able to give if they have to give up their jobs in the  UK.
    The Appellants have been here for over nine years.  There has  been  no
    reliance on public funds.  There are no negative issues in  respect  of
    Article 8.  Their removal would be disproportionate.  If they left this
    country they would have no right to go to Italy and they would have  to
    go to Mauritius


 6. Mr Tufan  pointed  out  that  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  has  changed.   He
    accepted that there is a financial dependency  between  the  Appellants
    and their son.  He is financially dependent on them.  He relied on  the
    decision in AAO v Entry Clearance Officer  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  840.   He
    referred me to paragraph 117B(3) and pointed out  that  the  Appellants
    spent their formative years in Mauritius and it could hardly be said to
    be prejudicial to their wellbeing to send them back there.

 7. Mr Gokhool submitted that they had not been there for 25  years.   They
    have no ties there.  He relied on   the decision in Ogundimu   (Article
    8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60 (IAC). The Appellants' family are
    all in Italy or the UK.  They would have no home or jobs in  Mauritius.
    In written submissions he said that the Appellants'  son  was  only  10
    years old when he came here. He completed  his  primary  and  secondary
    education here.  He was born in Italy  where  he  attended  an  English
    school.

My Findings

 8. I have given very careful consideration to all the evidence  before  me
    in this case.

 9. I accept that the Appellants' son is studying in the  UK  and  that  he
    needs their financial assistance.  He is now an EEA citizen and it  was
    suggested at the hearing that it may be  possible  for  an  application
    under European law to be made by the Appellants in order to enable them
    to stay in the UK with their son.  I make no comment on the possibility
    of that.  It is not a matter for me.

10. The Appellants cannot succeed under any of the provisions of  Paragraph
    276 ADE except perhaps sub-paragraph (vi). At the time the decision was
    made by the Respondent Paragraph 276ADE (vi) provided for an  applicant
    who, at the date of application,

         'is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in  the  UK  for
         less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but has
         no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the country  to
         which he would have to go if required to leave the UK.'

11. Paragraph 276ADE was  amended with effect from 10th July 2014  and  the
    amendment  replaces the words in parenthesis   in  paragraph  10  above
    with,

           'there would be very significant  obstacles  to  the  applicant's
    integration into'.

12. Mr Tufan submitted that  this  new  version  applies  to  this  appeal.
    According to Statement of Changes HC532 this change  came  into  effect
    on 28th July 2014 and applies to all applications  to  which  paragraph
    276ADE and Appendix FM apply and to any other ECHR   Article  8  claims
    which are 'decided' on or after  that  date.  I  assume  this  to  mean
    'decided by the Secretary of State' since the wording of section 19  of
    the Immigration Act 2014 is different, being said  to  apply  'where  a
    court or tribunal is required to  determine  whether  a  decision  made
    under the Immigration Acts',   in summary,   breaches a person's  human
    rights. The application in this case was decided on 8th November   2013
    so the original version of 276ADE applies.  The  decision  Ogundimu  is
    therefore also relevant. This was a decision  pertaining  to  paragraph
    399 of the Immigration . Rules but the Tribunal  noted  that  the  same
    wording was used in paragraph 276ADE (vi). The Tribunal said,

         'The natural and ordinary meaning of the word 'ties'  in  paragraph
         399A of the Immigration Rules imports a concept involving something
         more than merely  remote  or  abstract  links  to  the  country  of
         proposed  deportation  or  removal.  It  involves  there  being   a
         connection to life in that  country.  Consideration  of  whether  a
         person has 'no ties' to such  a  country  must  involve  a  rounded
         assessment of all of the relevant circumstances and is  not  to  be
         limited to 'social, cultural and family' circumstances.'

13. It is 25 years since the Appellants left Mauritius and  I  accept  that
    there will have been many changes there in that  time.  I  accept  that
    they are now accustomed to European culture.     Both  Appellants  have
    however worked in the UK and the First Appellant has studied here. They
    are only 50 years old.  I see no reason to suppose that they would  not
    be able to obtain work in Mauritius.  The Appellants  have  each  other
    and the first Appellant has a sister there.  Having considered all  the
    evidence in the round I  must  conclude  that  they  do  not  meet  the
    criteria set out in Paragraph 276ADE (vi).

14. I now deal with Article 8 ECHR.

15. In Razgar, R (on the Application of) v. Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2004] UKHL 27 (17 June 2004) the court said that there  are
    5 questions that must be asked in considering the question of a  breach
    of Article 8,

    (1)  Is there an interference with the right  to  respect  for  private
    life (which includes the  right  to  respect  for  physical  and  moral
    integrity) and family life?

    (2)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity as
         potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

    (3)  Is that interference in accordance with the law?

    (4)  Does that interference have a legitimate aim?

    (5)  Is the interference proportionate in a democratic society  to  the
         legitimate aim to be achieved.

16. I must also take account of paragraph 117B of the  of  the  Nationality
    Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  which  sets  out   the   following
    considerations of the public interest  to  be  taken  into  account  in
    considering whether to grant leave to remain  under  Article  8.  These
    considerations are,
    (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
interest.
    (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
    the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English,
    because persons who can speak English-
         (a)are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b)are better able to integrate into society.
    (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
    the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
    because such persons-
         (a)are not a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b)are better able to integrate into society.
    (4)Little weight should be given to-
         (a)a private life, or
         (b)a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.
    (5)Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
    person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
    (6)In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the public
    interest does not require the person's removal where-
         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
         with a qualifying child, and

         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom

17. None of the above factors prejudice the Appellants' case. They have not
    remained in   the UK without leave. They have both worked and supported
    themselves and have not been  reliant  on  public  funds.  Neither  has
    committed  a  criminal  offence.  These   factors   are   not   however
    determinative but  factors  to  be  taken  into  account  in  assessing
    proportionality.

18. I  accept  that  the  Appellants  have  over  nine  years  developed  a
    meaningful private life in the UK and indeed a family life  with  their
    son who is now 19 years old and  has  recently  embarked  on  a  degree
    course at Loughborough University. I take into account that  their  son
    is financially dependant on them. They are meeting  the  costs  of  his
    education but as I have found above, there is no evidence before me  to
    suggest that a couple who have worked throughout the last 25 years will
    not be able to obtain work in Mauritius. Clearly they left Mauritius to
    work and make a better life and left Italy for the same  reason.  Their
    leave to remain in the UK did however expire. Their son has started   a
    new phase of his life and apart from the financial dependency, I am not
    satisfied  that it has been established that the  relationship  between
    the Appellants and their son goes beyond the usual family ties  between
    a young adult at university and his parents. I take into  account  that
    their son now has Italian citizenship. I have given weight to the  fact
    that the Appellants have been in Europe for 25 years having  lived  for
    many years in Italy. I have found this a difficult  decision  but  must
    conclude that the removal of the Appellants from the UK will in all the
    circumstances  not  be  disproportionate  to  the  need  for  effective
    immigration control in the UK.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration  Rules  and  on  Human  rights
grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
