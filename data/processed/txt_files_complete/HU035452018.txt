                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The claimant is a citizen of  India  born  on  4th  March  1985.  He
       arrived in the UK on 2006 as a Tier 1 general migrant.  He  extended
       his visa on several occasions and on 19th May  2016,  prior  to  the
       expiry of his leave to remain, he applied for  indefinite  leave  to
       remain based on his having completed five years residence as a  Tier
       1 general migrant. That application was refused on 28th  June  2017.
       On 13th July 2017 he submitted a second application  for  indefinite
       leave to remain, this time based on ten years lawful residence.  His
       application was refused in a decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State
       dated 13th January  2018.   His  appeal  against  the  decision  was
       allowed on Article 8  ECHR  grounds  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Mailer in a determination promulgated on the 1st October 2018.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Kebede  on
       5th January 2019 on the basis that it was arguable that  the  First-
       tier judge had erred in law in failing to have  regard  to  material
       matters when deciding that the  respondent  had  not  discharge  the
       burden of proving dishonesty.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    4. The Secretary of State sets out in the grounds of appeal and in oral
       submissions of Mr Whitwell that the claimant accepts that he  failed
       to make a valid tax return for the year 2009/2010. The claimant says
       that this was an accountants'  error  but,  it  is  contended,  this
       explanation fails to take into account the fact that the claimant is
       responsible for his  own  tax  affairs,  see  JR/13807/2016  Abbasi.
       Further, it is argued that the First-tier Tribunal failed to  follow
       the process for assessing the validity of such an excuse set out  at
       (v) of the guidance in  R  (on  the  application  of  Khan)  v  SSHD
       (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  384  IAC,
       particularly as there is a failure to report the accountant  to  the
       relevant regulatory body and the theft of the claimant's funds  paid
       on account to that accountant to the police. Thus,  the  failure  to
       lodge  these  accounts  should  rationally  have  sufficed  to  show
       deception as required for paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.



    5. Further, it is contended, that the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to
       consider  the  following  when  finding  the  claimant  credible  at
       paragraph 56 of the decision. Firstly, the fact  that  the  claimant
       had added to his account at the First-tier Tribunal hearing when  he
       said  that  he  had  paid  his  accountant  �5000  towards  his  tax
       liability, and that the claimant had not complained to the  relevant
       regulatory body about his accountant or reported the theft  of  this
       money  by  the  accountant  to  the  police.  Secondly  it  was  not
       reasonable to accept, at paragraph 57  of  the  decision,  that  the
       claimant could not contact his accountant when his evidence was that
       his solicitor and accountant shared the same  office.  Thirdly,  the
       claimant accepted before the First-tier Tribunal that he had  signed
       his tax return but also said that he had not  received  confirmation
       from HMRC about the payment of that tax.

    6. Mr Whitwell also argued that the self-direction at paragraph  55  of
       the decision was arguably  incomplete  as  in  Khan  the  evidential
       burden is a shifting one with  the  Secretary  of  State  having  to
       provide a prima facie case regarding deception, and then the  burden
       shifts to the claimant to provide a plausible explanation  and  then
       in the light of all information the Tribunal must assess whether the
       respondent has proved his case of showing deceit and/ or  dishonesty
       to the civil standard of proof.

    7. In the Rule 24 notice and in oral submissions Ms Harvey  argued  for
       the claimant that there was no change in his account with respect to
       his dealings with accountant: he simply had  not  been  asked  about
       some matters prior to the hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
       for instance about the �5000 payment in advance to  his  accountant,
       and so they  were  not  dealt  with  in  his  interview  or  witness
       statement. The claimant had not complained about the loss  of  �5000
       as when he found out it had not been paid to HMRC  he  felt  he  had
       been stupid and had shortly other things to deal  with,  namely  the
       applications for leave and thereafter the refusal of his  indefinite
       leave to remain Home Office application. There was  evidence  before
       the First-tier Tribunal that he had tried to get in touch  with  his
       former solicitors who were  in  the  same  building  as  his  former
       accountant, see paragraphs 25, 33  and  37  of  the  decision.   The
       claimant says that he is not entirely certain whether he signed  his
       accounts, but  believes  that  he  did,  see  paragraph  34  of  the
       decision. There is no reason to find any of these issues ones  which
       reduce the credibility of  the  claimant's  account,  and  thus  the
       conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal were rationally open  to  it.
       Further, it is argued, the Secretary of State's interviewer had also
       found the claimant to be credible, as is recorded at paragraph 42 of
       the decision.

    8. This was not a case involving a misleading submission to HMRC as the
       accounts for 2009/2010 were not served at all until after  the  fact
       they were missing came to light in 2015.  This  issue  was  not  the
       central focus of the interview with the Secretary  of  State.  Thus,
       this case differs on its facts from the many others where the amount
       declared to HMRC differed from that declared to the Home  Office  on
       applications for further leave to remain. As it was the  first  year
       of accounts that were  missing  the  HMRC  would  not  have  sent  a
       reminder to ask for them either as the claimant would not have  been
       on their radar at all at that time.

    9. It was therefore  open  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  find  the
       claimant credible in the explanation he provided for the issue  with
       his accounts and not to find that he had been deceptive.  It  was  a
       long and careful hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  and  there
       were good  reasons  given  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  their
       decision. A number of matters stated at paragraph 2 of  the  renewal
       grounds from the Secretary of State were not true: it was  not  true
       that the First-tier Tribunal had  found  the  claimant  a  deceptive
       person; it was not true that the claimant had signed  off  incorrect
       paperwork; and it was not true that he had left this  matter  to  be
       resolved until it suited him.

   10. Ms Harvey argued that there was no misdirection  on  the  burden  of
       proof. It was clear that the First-tier Tribunal had looked  at  the
       prima facie case presented  by  the  Secretary  of  State,  and  the
       explanation provided  by  the  claimant  and  then  decided  if  the
       Secretary of State had shown that  the  claimant  was  not  of  good
       character through proving to the civil  standard  of  proof  on  the
       totality of the evidence that the claimant had been dishonest in his
       dealings with HMRC and the Home Office.



Conclusions - Error of Law

   11. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  guides  himself  appropriately  when
       determining the appeal by reference to the Secretary of State's  own
       guidance on the General grounds of Refusal dated 10th April 2017 and
       the Long Residence Guidance dated 3rd April 2017, see paragraphs  57
       to 60. The direction at paragraph 55  on  the  burden  of  proof  in
       relation to the general grounds of refusal is legally correct. There
       is no doubt that the approach adopted by the First-tier Tribunal was
       to consider the contention made by the Secretary of State  that  the
       claimant was deceptive  by  way  of  failing  to  declare  his  self
       employed income for the tax year ending April 2010 to  HMRC,  whilst
       declaring it to the Home Office, see paragraph 56 of  the  decision,
       and then going on to consider the explanation for  this  offered  by
       the claimant before concluding that the burden of showing  deception
       was not met by the Secretary of State.

   12. When considering the credibility of the claimant I find that it  was
       appropriate to consider the claimant's lack of criminal  convictions
       and letters attesting his good character as is done at paragraph  62
       of the decision. It is clear that the fact of correct returns  being
       made in other years was found to be particularly significant by  the
       First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  when  assessing  whether  there  was  a
       misrepresentation relating to the tax year 2009/2010, see paragraphs
       62, 64 and 66. I  find  that  this  was  also  a  lawfully  relevant
       consideration. Consideration is given to the fact  that  the  former
       accountant could not be reached despite efforts  on  the  claimant's
       part, see paragraph 57 of the  decision,  and  that  the  accountant
       could have made the error at paragraph 67 of the  decision.  I  find
       that it was open to that First-tier Tribunal not  to  consider  that
       additional information about the payment of �5000 on account to  the
       accountant, which came to light in the lengthy hearing,  was  not  a
       matter which affected the finding of the  claimant  being  credible.
       The  provision  of  additional  information  at  a  hearing  is  not
       necessarily a negative matter.

   13. In the context of all of the evidence the First-tier Tribunal  finds
       that the explanation that it was an  error  by  the  accountant  was
       plausible. I find it was open to the First-tier  Tribunal  to  reach
       this conclusion given that there is an explanation  for  a  lack  of
       documentation as the accountant was no longer at the  address  where
       he had been based at that time; there is an explanation  as  to  why
       the claimant did not realise until 2015 that the error of failing to
       make a submission had happened and as Ms Harvey  has  argued  it  is
       plausible that this failing would not have come  to  the  claimant's
       notice given it should have been his first tax return  and  this  is
       what  the  First-tier  Tribunal  accepts  at  paragraph  56  of  the
       decision; and it is clear from the findings at paragraph 56 that the
       tax and  interest was paid in 2015 when the claimant became aware of
       the failing, and as set out at paragraph 19 there is  correspondence
       from his current accountant about  the  correction  of  the  errors.
       Whilst it is the case that the claimant had not lodged  a  complaint
       with the regulatory body or police about his accountant by the  time
       of the hearing the First-tier Tribunal was  satisfied  that  he  had
       tried to address the problem by unsuccessful attempts to contact the
       accountant by phone and visiting the place that had been his office.
       The claimant's history is that he instructed an  accountant  and  to
       the best of his memory signed off his accounts and provided him with
       the funds to make the 2009/2010 return, and so this is not  a  case,
       like a number of others which have come to light recently,  where  a
       claimant has demonstrably been shown to  have  failed  to  take  his
       responsibility and signed off a differing amount to  HMRC.   I  find
       that the guidance at (v) in Khan has been substantially followed  by
       the First-tier Tribunal when considering whether the explanation  of
       accountant error was plausible, and that  the  conclusion  that  the
       claimant had not been deceptive was a decision that  was  rationally
       open to the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  facts  and  sufficiently
       reasoned.

   14. I find that the  First-tier  Tribunal  has  therefore  properly  and
       lawfully addressed the key substantial issue in  the  appeal,  which
       was whether the appellant is of good character given the  allegation
       of HMRC/ Home Office dishonesty relating to  this  tax  return,  and
       that it was lawfully open to that Tribunal to allow  the  appeal  on
       human rights grounds having found that the  claimant  had  shown  he
       could meet the requirements of paragraph  276B  of  the  Immigration
       Rules and so there was no public interest in his  removal  given  he
       had been lawfully in the UK for ten years; speaks  English;  and  is
       financially independent.



          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      the making of an error on a point of law.

   2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal  on  human
      rights grounds is upheld.
