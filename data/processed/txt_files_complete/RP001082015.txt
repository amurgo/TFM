Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Neale, of Counsel, instructed by Paragon Law.
For the Respondent:    Mr. S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and background facts:


 1. The appellant is a national  of  the  Republic  of  Congo  (not  to  be
    confused with the Democratic Republic of Congo or DRC),  born  on  [  ]
    1994 and 21 years old. He appeals, with permission, against a  decision
    of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal A D Troup (hereafter referred to as
    the "Judge") who, following a hearing on 12 April 2016,  dismissed  his
    appeal against a deportation order dated 13 November 2015 made  against
    him as a foreign criminal. The respondent was  required  to  order  his
    deportation under s.32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 (the  "2007  Act")
    unless one of the exceptions in s.33 applies. The relevant exception in
    this particular case is Exception 1 which applies where the removal  of
    a foreign criminal in pursuance of the deportation order would  breach:
    (a) a person's rights  under  the  1950  European  Convention  for  the
    Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  ("ECHR"),  or  (b)
    the  United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  the  1951  United  Nations'
    Convention  Relating  to  the  Status   of   Refugees   (the   "Refugee
    Convention").

 2. The appellant arrived in the UK on 6 January 2002 with his  mother  and
    his younger brother ("MJ"). The appellant was 7� years old, his brother
    5� years old. He has two half-sisters who were  aged  14  years  and  8
    years at the date of the hearing before the Judge and who were born  in
    the United Kingdom. He also has an older sister who was aged  25  years
    at the date of the hearing before the Judge.

 3. The appellant had lived in the Republic of Congo from  birth  until  14
    October 1997, when he was nearly 3� years old, and in Gabon for about 4
    years before his arrival in the UK.

 4. The appellant's mother claimed asylum on 14 January 2002, shortly after
    her  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Her  appeal  was  allowed   by
    Adjudicator I.E. Vellins (hereafter referred to as the "Adjudicator" to
    distinguish him from the Judge), following a hearing on 8 August  2002,
    on asylum grounds and in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR.  She
    was granted indefinite leave to remain as a refugee by letter dated  12
    February 2003 (the "Status letter")

 5. The appellant's criminal convictions are set out below. The convictions
    of 4 October 2013 led to the respondent notifying  the  appellant  that
    she intended to cease his refugee status in a letter dated  9  February
    2015 (the  "Notification  letter").  She  subsequently  did  cease  (or
    purport to cease) his refugee status in the decision dated 13  November
    2015 (the "Decision letter"), which relied, inter alia, on the  reasons
    given in the Notification Letter. We summarise below  the  reasons  for
    the respondent's deportation order, her decision to cease  (or  purport
    to cease) the appellant's refugee status and  her  decision  to  refuse
    humanitarian protection and his human rights claims.

 6. The Status letter referred to the appellant  and  two  of  his  younger
    siblings (the youngest had not been born then) as dependents.  However,
    in her communications with the appellant and the  UNHCR  (see  para  98
    below), the respondent treated the appellant as someone  who  has  been
    granted refugee status in his own right, for example, by giving  notice
    of her  intention  to  cease  refugee  status.  We  accept  Mr  Neale's
    submission that the appellant was in fact granted refugee status by the
    respondent notwithstanding that the Status letter may suggest otherwise
    and notwithstanding that  the  Notification  letter  and  the  Decision
    letter may, in part, also do so. That is the basis upon which the Judge
    decided this appeal. We decide this appeal on that basis.

 7. In the course of his submissions on ground 4, Mr Neale  requested  that
    the hearing before us be adjourned part-heard in order  to  enable  the
    appellant to produce evidence to support the explanations  advanced  in
    the grounds and the skeleton  argument  dated  23  June  2016  for  the
    failure of the appellant's mother and  sister  to  attend  the  hearing
    before the Judge. We refused the adjournment request. Since the reasons
    for the adjournment request are inextricably bound up with ground 4, we
    give our reasons for our decision to refuse Mr Neale's request  for  an
    adjournment in the course of our assessment of ground 4.

 8. It is relevant to summarise the reasons why the appellant  was  granted
    refugee status. This requires us to summarise the basis of  the  asylum
    claim  of  the  appellant's  mother  and  the  determination   of   the
    Adjudicator (see paras 16-18 below).

 9. It should be noted that the Judge had the report of an expert, Ms Ticky
    Monekosso, that was prepared not in relation to  the  appellant's  case
    but  that  of  his  younger  brother,  MJ,  who  was  also  subject  to
    deportation proceedings and who had an appeal before Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal L Murray (hereafter Judge Murray to distinguish her  from
    the Judge and the Adjudicator) at the same hearing centre on  21  April
    2016. It is not known why the First-tier Tribunal was not requested  to
    list the appeals for hearing before the same judge.  As  will  be  seen
    below, the Judge did not place  much  weight  on  the  evidence  of  Ms
    Monekosso, whereas Judge Murray accepted the opinion  of  Ms  Monekosso
    without question and therefore allowed MJ's appeal, finding that  there
    were substantial grounds for believing that MJ  would  be  at  risk  of
    treatment contrary to Article 3 on return.

10. The decision of Judge Murray  was  produced  at  the  hearing  when  we
    indicated that we were aware from the Tribunal's computer  system  that
    Judge  Murray  had  allowed  MJ's  appeal  and  that  the  respondent's
    application to the First-tier Tribunal for  permission  to  appeal  was
    awaiting a decision.   Mr  Kotas  objected  to  the  admission  of  the
    decision of Judge Murray, as it was produced at the hearing without any
    application for its admission having been made. We deal with this issue
    at paras 119-123 below.

The appellant's criminal convictions

11. On 27 January 2012, the  appellant  was  convicted  at  Nottingham  and
    Newark Juvenile Court for intimidating a witness or juror  with  intent
    to obstruct, pervert  or  interfere  with  justice  for  which,  on  17
    February 2012, he was given a 12-month referral order.

12. On 4 December 2012, the appellant was  convicted  at  Nottingham  Crown
    Court for possessing an imitation forearm with intent to cause fear  of
    violence. On 17 January 2013, he was sentenced to 12  months  detention
    in a Young Offenders' institution ("YOI"). Due to this  conviction,  he
    was notified of his liability to deportation. However,  the  respondent
    stated that it was considered at that time that as a recognised refugee
    who had not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  2  years  or
    more, that no deportation action would be taken  against  him  at  that
    time. On 18 February 2013, he was given a warning letter  which  stated
    that no deportation action would be taken against him but  that  if  he
    came to adverse attention  again,  the  Secretary  of  State  would  be
    obliged to consider the question of his deportation.

13. On 4 October 2013, the appellant  was  convicted  at  Nottingham  Crown
    Court for robbery and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to
    cause fear of violence. He was sentenced to 4 years 6  months  for  the
    robbery and 36 months in respect of the imitation firearm offence in  a
    YOI, to run concurrently. It is  these  convictions  that  brought  the
    appellant within the automatic deportation provisions and triggered the
    decision that was the subject of the appeal before the Judge.

14. The Judge had before him  the  sentencing  remarks  of  the  sentencing
    judge. The Judge noted  that  the  appellant  had  used  the  imitation
    firearm to frighten his victim to hand over a mobile phone and a wallet
    containing a "not inconsiderable amount of cash".  He  noted  that  the
    sentencing judge described the offence as  "very  serious  indeed"  and
    said that "custody of some length is inevitable". The Judge noted  that
    the sentencing judge had noted that a sentence of 8 years was indicated
    but, given the appellant's age at the time (19  years  and  his  guilty
    plea), the sentence was reduced.

15. The appellant's custodial sentence ended on 6 December 2015 since  when
    he has been detained at the Immigration reporting centre, The Verne.

The basis of mother's claim for asylum

16. The appellant's mother claimed asylum on the ground  that  she  was  at
    risk of persecution on account of her relationship  with  her  maternal
    aunt's husband, who was the ousted former President Pascal Lissouba. At
    the age of 5 years, the  appellant's  mother  went  to  live  with  her
    maternal aunt. In her evidence to the Adjudicator,  she  said  she  was
    "given" to her aunt who was childless. She lived with her maternal aunt
    and her husband in the Republic of Congo from 1975 until 1979 when  her
    maternal aunt and President  Lissouba  fled  the  country  due  to  the
    political situation in the country. The appellant's mother remained  in
    the Republic of Congo. She lived with  her  maternal  grandmother.  The
    maternal aunt and the former President  returned  to  the  Republic  of
    Congo in 1992, when the appellant's mother started to  live  with  them
    again until 14 October 1997 when President Lissouba was  overthrown  by
    Mr Denis Sassou-Nguessou, the current  President  of  the  Republic  of
    Congo. On that date, they all fled the Republic of Congo  and  went  to
    live in Gabon until the aunt came to the United Kingdom in August 1998.
    The appellant's mother arrived on 6 January 2002 with the appellant and
    his younger brother.

17. The Adjudicator heard oral evidence from the appellant's mother and her
    maternal aunt who was granted indefinite leave to remain as  a  refugee
    on 15 January 2001. At the time, Mr Lissouba was living in  the  United
    Kingdom. In evidence, the maternal aunt of the appellant's mother  said
    that she knew the father of the appellant  who  bears  the  same  name,
    albeit that the Adjudicator gives a variant of the spelling of his name
    at para 15 of his determination. She said that the  appellant's  father
    was killed in the conflict leading to the overthrow of her husband. The
    evidence of the appellant's mother was that he was killed by the forces
    of the current President.

18. The Adjudicator accepted the evidence of the appellant's mother and her
    maternal aunt, stating that he found them  credible  and  believed  the
    totality of their evidence. He was satisfied that the government of the
    Republic of Congo would not accept the  return  of  the  niece  of  the
    former President without persecuting her. He found  that  there  was  a
    real risk that the appellant's mother would be persecuted  as  a  close
    relative of the former President.

The respondent's decision in the appellant's case

19. In the Decision letter, the respondent made the following decisions:

    i)      She decided that the  appellant  can  no  longer,  because  the
       circumstances in connection with which he had been recognised  as  a
       refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of
       the protection of the country of his origin and nationality.

      This is the wording in Article 1C(5) of the  Refugee  Convention.  It
       provides that that the Refugee  Convention  ceases  to  apply  to  a
       person "if he can no longer, because of circumstances in  connection
       with which he has been recognised have ceased to exist, continue  to
       refuse to  avail  himself  of  the  protection  of  the  country  of
       nationality".

      This wording is also to be found in para 339A(v) of the Statement  of
       Changes in the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) (the  "Rules").
       Para 339A(v) sets out the circumstances in which a  person's  "grant
       of asylum" will be "revoked or not renewed".

      (We observe at this point that the relationship between Article 1C(5)
       and para 339A was considered in Dang (Refugee - query  revocation  -
       Article 3) [2013] UKUT 00043 (IAC)).


    ii)      She  certified  the  appellant's  case  under  s.72   of   the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act").


      Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention prohibits  refoulement  of  a
       refugee but, by virtue of Article 33(2),  the  benefit  of  the  no-
       refoulement provision may not be claimed by a  refugee  who,  having
       been convicted by a final judgment of a "particularly serious crime"
       constitutes a danger to the community.  Section 72 of the  2002  Act
       applies for the purpose  of  the  construction  and  application  of
       Article 33(2) of the  Refugee  Convention.  Section  72(2)  provides
       that:


           A person shall be presumed to have been  convicted  by  a  final
           judgment of a particularly serious crime  and  to  constitute  a
           danger to the community of the UK if he is -


                 (a)   convicted in the UK of an offence, and
                 (b)   sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  at  least
           two years."

            The consequence of the appellant's case  being  certified  under
       s.72 was that there was a rebuttable presumption that he constituted
       a danger to the community of  the  United  Kingdom.  The  respondent
       considered that the appellant had not rebutted the presumption.

    iii)    She decided that the appellant was excluded  from  humanitarian
       protection under para 339D(iii) of  the  Rules  because  there  were
       serious reasons for considering that he constitutes a danger to  the
       community or to the security of the United Kingdom.

    iv)     In relation to Article 8, she considered para 398 of the Rules.
       She considered that the public  interest  required  the  appellant's
       deportation unless there were very compelling circumstances over and
       above those described in paras 399  and  399A  of  the  Rules.   The
       respondent decided that the appellant had not provided evidence of a
       very strong  Article  8  claim  over  and  above  the  circumstances
       described in the exceptions to deportation described  in  paras  399
       and 399A (para 64 of the Decision letter).   She  therefore  refused
       the Article 8 claim.

The decision of the Judge


20. At paras 25-27 of his decision, the Judge considered an application for
    the hearing before him to be adjourned.  The Judge  recorded  that  the
    hearing was listed for 10.00a.m. but when it began at 1.25p.m., Counsel
    for the appellant (Ms S Caseley) informed him that the appellant wished
    to call his mother and older sister to give  evidence  on  his  behalf.
    Their witness statements are at  items  2  and  3  of  the  appellant's
    bundle.  At that point the witnesses had not  arrived  but  Ms  Caseley
    informed the Judge that she understood from a conversation she had  had
    with her instructing solicitors that the witnesses  had  set  out  from
    their home in Nottingham to travel to the Tribunal in Newport by  train
    at 10.30a.m. that morning.

21. At 2.35p.m. (having heard the appellant's evidence) the  Judge  invited
    Ms Caseley to telephone  the  appellant's  sister  following  which  Ms
    Caseley informed the Judge that the witnesses were unable to attend the
    hearing, having "missed the train or something like that":  Ms  Caseley
    did not know the reason for their non-attendance but  applied  for  the
    hearing to be adjourned part-heard to enable them to attend.

22. The Judge refused the application for reasons which he gave at para  27
    of his decision. He noted that the notice of hearing had been  sent  to
    the appellant and his solicitors on 18 March 2016, that  it  was  clear
    from the witness statements and from the telephone conversation between
    Counsel and the appellant's older sister that the witnesses were  aware
    of the hearing date and time  but  they  had  offered  no  satisfactory
    explanation for their non-attendance.  He concluded that it was not  in
    the interests of justice for the case to be  adjourned,  informing  the
    appellant that he would give due weight to the contents of the  witness
    statements in the bundle.

23. The Judge found that the appellant had not rebutted the presumption  in
    s.72 of the 2002 Act. He then turned to what he described as the second
    issue as follows: "Would deportation breach the Refugee Convention  and
    Articles 2 and 3".  At para  47  he  posed  the  question  whether  the
    respondent could discharge the burden of showing that over the last  14
    years there has been a significant  and  non-temporary  change  in  the
    country situation in  the  Republic  of  Congo  such  that  a  fear  of
    persecution can no longer be regarded  as  well-founded.  He  concluded
    that there had been such a significant and non-temporary change in  the
    country situation in the Republic of Congo and that there was  no  real
    risk of persecution.

24. In relation to Article 8, the Judge  found  that  there  were  no  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paras  399
    and 399A.

25. The Judge gave his reasons for his findings at  paras  39-80  which  we
    quote as appropriate in the course of our assessment below.

The grounds and submissions

26. There are four grounds as follows:

27. Ground  1  challenges  the  Judge's  finding  that  there  had  been  a
    significant and non-temporary change in Republic of Congo. Ground 1 may
    be summarised as follows:

    (a)     The Judge erred in failing  to  apply  the  correct  burden  of
          proof. It was for the respondent to  demonstrate  that  there  has
          been a significant and non-temporary change in  the  situation  in
          the Republic of Congo before the cessation clause can be applied.

    (b)     The Judge failed to consider the risk on return as a result  of
          the appellant's family connection with Mr Lissouba properly or  at
          all. Alternatively, he  failed  to  give  sufficient  reasons  for
          departing from the finding by the Adjudicator that the appellant's
          mother  (and  therefore,  it  is  contended,  the  appellant)  was
          sufficiently closely connected to the former President  to  be  at
          real risk.

    (c)     The Judge failed to consider whether the appellant is  at  real
          risk on account of his perceived  political  opinion  due  to  his
          family connection with Mr Lissouba.

    (d)     The Judge erred in his application of the country guidance case
          of LM.

    (e)     The Judge failed to consider the risk to the appellant  on  the
          basis of his criminal convictions and as a failed asylum seeker.

    (f)     The Judge materially erred in law  in  his  assessment  of  the
          expert report of Ms Monekosso.

    (g)     The Judge failed to properly consider the evidence  as  to  the
          current political climate in the Republic of Congo. He  failed  to
          consider the background relating to the 2016 Presidential election
          and its aftermath, made  no  analysis  of  the  current  political
          situation and failed to take into account the volatile situation.

    (h)     The Judge failed to consider whether the appellant is  at  real
          risk of coming to the adverse attention of the authorities in  the
          Republic of Congo when questioned on arrival, given that he is not
          expected to lie.

28. Ground 2 is that the Judge materially erred in his application  of  the
    legal test under s.72 of the 2002 Act for the following reasons:

    i)      He incorrectly attributed the categorisation of  the  level  of
          risk as a "medium  to  high-risk  offender"  at  para  44  of  his
          decision.

      Mr Neale did not pursue this at the  hearing,  as  he  accepted  that
          there was evidence before the  Judge  that  the  appellant  was  a
          medium risk offender.

    ii)     He overlooked or misstated or failed to  engage  with  evidence
          that  was  positive  and  which   significantly   undermined   his
          conclusions.  He  was  therefore  obliged  to  engage  which  such
          evidence.

29. Ground 3 is that the Judge materially erred in law in his assessment of
    the appellant's Article 8 claim, as follows:

    i)      He materially erred in law in reaching  his  finding  that  the
          relationship between the appellant and his mother and siblings did
          not amount to family life.

    ii)     In reaching his  finding,  at  para  79  (viii)  "I  find  that
          inevitably he will face a  difficult  period  of  adjustment  upon
          arrival in Congo but, in due time,  with  the  social  skills  and
          enterprise that he has learnt here, will form a private  life  for
          himself", he failed to consider the fact that  the  appellant  had
          never had to integrate into a new society  and/or  culture  as  an
          adult and that he would  therefore  face  particular  difficulties
          over and above a normal robust individual being returned to  their
          country of origin.

      iii)       The judge failed to give any or any  adequate  reasons  for
          finding  that  there  are  no  very  compelling  circumstances  to
          outweigh the public interest in deportation.

30. Ground 4 concerns the Judge's refusal to adjourn  the  hearing  on  the
    basis that there was no clear reason  for  the  non-attendance  of  the
    appellant's mother and older sister. It  is  said  that  it  has  since
    transpired that they were unable to pay for the train  tickets  on  the
    day. The Judge's refusal to adjourn the hearing was unfair, taking into
    account the overriding objective. In this regard, reliance is placed on
    Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC) at para 14  and
    SH (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 1284 at  paras  13-14.  In  the
    skeleton argument and in submissions, it  was  contended,  in  reliance
    upon para 6 of Nwaigwe, that the appellant had not waived his right  to
    a fair hearing and that the adjournment request  was  not  spurious  or
    frivolous or vexatious. At the hearing, Mr Neale stressed that  it  was
    not the appellant's fault that his witnesses had  not  attended  court.
    Asylum seekers should  not  be  penalised  for  the  conduct  of  third
    parties.

31. We put to Mr Neale the  fact  that  the  explanation  advanced  in  the
    skeleton argument was different from the explanation given to the Judge
    who was specifically told by Ms. Caseley, Counsel  for  the  appellant,
    that the witnesses had set out to travel by train at 10.30 am that  day
    and that they had "missed the train or something like that" whereas the
    explanation advanced in the skeleton argument was that they  could  not
    afford to pay for the train tickets.  Furthermore,  these  explanations
    were not evidenced in  the  form  of  witness  statement.  The  factual
    assertions in the grounds and the skeleton argument were not more  than
    that, mere assertions of fact.

32. Mr Neale then applied for  the  hearing  to  be  adjourned  part-heard,
    saying that he took full  responsibility  for  not  arranging  for  the
    allegations to be evidenced by witness statements.  He  submitted  that
    the appellant should not be prejudiced on account of  failings  on  his
    (Mr Neale's) part.

33. In the grounds, it is contended that the evidence  of  the  appellant's
    mother and older sister was crucial to the appellant's Article 8 claim.
    The skeleton argument also argues that the evidence was material to the
    Judge's finding that the relationship between  the  appellant  and  his
    mother and  siblings  did  not  extend  beyond  "normal  family  ties".
    However, at the hearing, Mr Neale submitted that the  evidence  of  the
    mother was also important to the risk faced by the appellant on return,
    since she was better able than the appellant to give  evidence  of  her
    relationship to the former  President.  He  submitted  that  this  came
    within the ambit of ground 4 (see paras 45 and 46 below).

Assessment

34. We will deal with the issues in this case in the following order:

    i)      Ground 4, in the course of which we will give our  reasons  for
       refusing the request for the appeal before us to be adjourned  part-
       heard.

      As will be seen below, we reject  ground  4.  In  our  judgment,  the
       appellant has had a fair hearing. It follows that the appeal  before
       us stands to be decided on the evidence that was before the Judge.

    ii)     Ground 2. For the reasons given at paras 58-69 below, we reject
       ground 2. We have concluded that the Judge did not materially err in
       law in finding that the appellant had not rebutted  the  presumption
       that he has committed a particularly serious crime and represents  a
       danger to the community.

    iii)    Ground 1, as follows:

      a)    First, the contention  that  the  Judge  erred  by  failing  to
             appreciate that the burden of proof is upon the  respondent  to
             show that, because the circumstances in connection  with  which
             the appellant was granted refugee status have ceased to exists,
             he can no longer continue to refuse to  avail  himself  of  the
             protection of the Republic of Congo. As explained  at  para  74
             below, our conclusion on ground 2 impacts upon this argument.

      b)    The remainder of ground 1.

    iv)     Ground 3.

Ground 4

35. Ground 4 is that the appellant has not had a fair hearing  because  the
    Judge refused to adjourn the hearing. The reason why  it  is  contended
    that he did not have a fair hearing is that his mother and older sister
    did not attend the hearing.

36. We reminded ourselves of the guidance in SH (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2011]
    EWCA Civ 1284 as well as Nwaigwe (adjournment:  fairness)  [2014]  UKUT
    00418 (IAC). Plainly, the appellant has not waived his right to a  fair
    hearing. The first question is whether there  was  a  good  reason  for
    adjourning the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT"). However,
    the lack of  a  good  reason  is  not  determinative.  The  overarching
    question is whether it was unfair to  refuse  to  adjourn  the  hearing
    (Nwaigwe, at paras 5, 6 and 8). This will require consideration of  the
    question whether the appeal could be justly  decided.  If  the  Judge's
    decision to refuse the  request  before  him  for  an  adjournment  was
    unfair, then the  Judge's  decision  will  have  been  reached  by  the
    adoption of an unfair procedure. If that is the case, his decision must
    be set aside unless we are satisfied that it would be pointless  to  do
    so because the result would inevitably be the same (SH (Afghanistan) at
    para 15).

37. Ms Caseley who appeared  for  the  appellant  before  the  Judge  said,
    initially, that she understood from a conversation with her instructing
    solicitors that the witnesses had set out from their home in Nottingham
    to travel to the Newport by train at 10.30 a.m. that morning.  However,
    Ms Caseley subsequently informed the  Judge  that  the  witnesses  were
    unable to attend the hearing having "missed the train or something like
    that". In the grounds of application for permission to  appeal,  it  is
    said that the Judge refused to adjourn the hearing because there was no
    clear reason for the non-attendance but that it  has  since  transpired
    that the mother and sister were unable to pay for the train tickets  on
    the  day.   Mr  Neale  submitted  that  the  appellant  should  not  be
    prejudiced for any failure on the part of  his  mother  and  sister  to
    arrange the necessary funds.

38. The difficulty  with  the  explanation  advanced  is  that  it  is  not
    supported by any evidence. When we pointed this out  to  Mr  Neale,  he
    said he accepted personal responsibility  for  the  failure  to  obtain
    witness statements from the appellant's mother and sister and requested
    us to adjourn the  hearing  part-heard`  in  order  to  enable  witness
    statements from the appellant's mother and older sister to be submitted
    to explain the reason for their non-attendance at  the  hearing  before
    the Judge.

39. We refused the adjournment request  because  even  if  the  explanation
    given for the failure to the appellant's mother  and  older  sister  to
    attend the hearing is accepted and it is accepted that this was a  good
    reason for seeking the adjournment of the hearing before the Judge,  it
    does not follow that the Judge's refusal to  adjourn  the  hearing  was
    unfair. In considering whether his refusal to adjourn the  hearing  was
    unfair, we have considered the relevance  or  possible  impact  of  the
    evidence of the appellant's mother and older sister to  the  issues  in
    the case and we have considered what other evidence  there  was  before
    the Judge on those issues.

40. The first point to note is that this is not a  case  of  the  appellant
    being absent from the hearing before the Judge. He was present to  give
    evidence on any issues in the case. There is no issue in this  case  of
    the respondent's reliance upon the opinion of an expert,  for  example,
    an age  assessment  report,  which  the  appellant  ought  to  have  an
    opportunity to refute.

41. Ground 4 contends that the evidence of the appellant's mother and older
    sister was crucial to the appellant's Article 8 claim. The Judge  found
    that the appellant did not  enjoy  family  life  with  his  mother  and
    siblings. We asked Mr Neale to take us to their witness  statements  so
    as to evaluate the likely probative value of their oral  evidence.  Our
    attention was drawn  to  paras  9  and  19  of  the  statement  of  the
    appellant's mother, which read:


          "9.     My health even now is poor and  I  have  regular  hospital
               stays, sometimes I am tired and have headaches,  I  get  the
               headaches worse with bad news, they hurt me constantly. I am
               a sufferer of HIV and take regular medication for this.  The
               more I think about the legal proceedings, the more pain I am
               in. I get down and depressed  about  it.  My  daughter  [the
               appellant's older sister] currently provides  me  with  some
               support but I need all of my family around me.


          19.     [The appellant] and I have a good relationship. He is more
               mature and now he understands things. We talk to each  other
               like adults. He is like a different person."

42. There is nothing in paras 9 and 19  which  is  capable  of  having  any
    material impact on the Judge's finding that family life  is  not  being
    enjoyed between the appellant and his mother. Nothing has been said  in
    the grounds  or  the  skeleton  argument  or  at  the  hearing  on  the
    appellant's behalf to say what evidence the  appellant's  mother  would
    give that might have a material impact on the Judge's  finding  if  she
    had another opportunity to give oral evidence. Our  attention  was  not
    drawn to anything in the witness statement  of  the  appellant's  older
    sister.

43. Furthermore, the appellant was  present  to  give  evidence  about  his
    relationship with his mother and siblings. It is evident that the Judge
    did not consider that his evidence established  that  family  life  was
    being enjoyed between the appellant and his mother  and  siblings.  The
    grounds do not suggest that the appellant gave oral evidence about  his
    relationship with his family that the Judge failed to take into account
    in reaching his finding that family life was not being enjoyed.

44. At a late stage at the hearing before us, Mr Neale submitted  that  the
    oral evidence of the appellant's mother was also relevant to  assessing
    the risk on return and that this was another reason why  the  appellant
    had not had a fair hearing. In this regard, Mr Neale drew our attention
    to the fact that para 22 of  his  skeleton  argument  also  linked  the
    relevance of the evidence of the appellant's mother and older sister to
    an assessment of the future risk.

45. We drew Mr Neale's attention to the fact that  ground  4,  as  drafted,
    suggested that the ground 4 concerned only  the  Article  8  claim.  Mr
    Neale referred us to the sentence in para 6(ii) of  the  grounds  which
    reads: "The Judge in failing to place  sufficient  weight  and/or  take
    into account considerations of fairness, in particular in light of  the
    fact these witness' attendance were crucial to the appellant's  Article
    8 ECHR claim, failed to give the appellant a fair hearing, ...".

46. Relying upon the words "in particular" at para 6(ii) of the grounds, Mr
    Neale submitted that the fair hearing issue  was  not  limited  to  the
    Article 8 claim; it also extended to the Judge's assessment of the risk
    on return.

47. We do not accept Mr Neale's submission that ground 4  extended  to  the
    Judge's assessment of the risk on return. It is  plain,  in  our  view,
    that ground 4 only concerned the appellant's Article  8  claim.  If  it
    applied also to the risk on return, one would  have  expected  this  to
    have been expressly mentioned in ground 4, especially given the greater
    importance of a breach of Article 3, against which there is an absolute
    prohibition, in comparison with Article 8 which is a qualified right.

48. In any event, we have considered Mr Neale's submission that the hearing
    was unfair because the mother was unable to  give  evidence  about  the
    risk on return. Any assessment of the risk on return is made by a judge
    by considering the specific facts relied in an individual case  against
    the situation in the country in question. Whilst it is true, of course,
    that an individual person such  as  the  appellant's  mother  may  have
    relevant evidence to give about  the  risk  on  return,  a  judge  will
    consider background evidence placed before him or her  and  any  expert
    evidence to make an assessment of the risk on return.

49. In the instant case, not only was there  no  dispute  about  the  facts
    relied upon, the Judge had the benefit  of  the  determination  of  the
    Adjudicator in the appeal  of  the  mother.  The  Adjudicator  had  the
    benefit of the following documents:  the  records  of  the  appellant's
    mother's screening interview and her substantive asylum, her "Statement
    of Evidence Form" (SEF) and her witness  statement.  The  Secretary  of
    State's representative indicated to the Adjudicator that  she  did  not
    wish to cross-examine her. The Adjudicator therefore did not hear  oral
    evidence from her but he heard oral  evidence  from  the  wife  of  the
    former president. The Adjudicator set out the  oral  evidence  of  this
    witness at paras 10-15 and a summary of the witness  statement  of  the
    appellant's mother at para 16-17 of  his  determination.   He  accepted
    their evidence and gave detailed reasons, making detailed  findings  of
    fact about the events upon which the asylum claim  of  the  appellant's
    mother was based. He gave detailed reasons for finding that she was  at
    real risk of persecution in the light of the background material then.

50. The Judge therefore had the benefit of a  detailed  assessment  by  the
    Adjudicator who received oral and  written  evidence  at  a  time  much
    closer to the occurrence of the events upon which  the  appeal  of  the
    appellant's mother was allowed.

51. The Judge also  had  the  benefit  of  a  witness  statement  from  the
    appellant's mother submitted in the appellant's appeal. At paras 3-7 of
    her witness  statement,  she  explained,  albeit  fairly  briefly,  the
    circumstances that led to her arrival in the UK.

52. The Judge also had the benefit of  an  expert  report,  i.e.  Ms  Ticky
    Monekosso.

53. There was no explanation before the Judge nor  before  us  as  to  what
    evidence the appellant's mother and/or older sister would have given if
    they had attended the hearing that went to the facts relied upon and/or
    the objective situation in the Republic  of  Congo  and  that  was  not
    already contained in the material that was before  the  Judge  or  that
    (insofar as it concerned the situation in the Republic of Congo)  could
    not have been dealt with by Counsel on his behalf.

54. Of course, we do not say that  the  appellant  is  obliged  to  advance
    before us all of the evidence that he seeks to rely upon  in  order  to
    make good his ground that the hearing that took place before the  Judge
    was unfair. That would be unrealistic. Nevertheless, he is not entitled
    to be completely silent about it. He must at least  descend  into  some
    detail, sufficient to enable the Upper Tribunal to conclude that he has
    been denied  unfairly  the  opportunity  to  adduce  evidence  that  is
    relevant or material to his appeal.

55. For all of the above reasons,  the  question  whether  the  appellant's
    mother and sister had a good reason for their  failure  to  attend  the
    hearing before the Judge was not material to the issue before us as  to
    whether the hearing before the Judge was unfair. We  therefore  refused
    to adjourn the hearing before us  part-heard  to  enable  Mr  Neale  to
    obtain witness statements from the appellant's  mother  and  sister  to
    explain why they did not attend the hearing before the Judge.

56. For the same  reasons,  we  are  satisfied  that  the  hearing  of  the
    appellant's appeal before the  Judge  was  not  unfair.   We  therefore
    reject ground 4.

57. It follows that the Judge was entitled to decide  the  appeal  on  such
    evidence as was before him.

Ground 2

58. Ground 2 challenges the Judge's finding  that  the  appellant  had  not
    rebutted the presumption in s.72 of the 2002 Act. The Judge  summarised
    the submissions on this issue at paras 28-38 and he  gave  his  reasons
    for his finding at paras 39-46. These read as follows:


            The First Issue: Section 72 NIAA 2002


           28.   I have  noted  A's  submission  to  the  effect  that  the
               presumption under S.72 that he had committed a  particularly
               serious crime and represents a danger to  the  community  is
               rebutted.


                       Mrs Williams submitted that A's convictions should be
               regarded as very  serious  crimes  indeed.   She  noted  his
               conviction on 4 December  2012  for  the  possession  of  an
               imitation firearm with intent, for which  he  was  given  12
               months' youth custody, which was followed by a warning  from
               the  Secretary  of  State  that  he  would  be  at  risk  of
               deportation in the event of a further offence.


                       As it was, a further offence was committed in  August
               2013 which again involved the  possession  of  an  imitation
               firearm  for  the  purposes  of  robbery.   There   was   an
               escalation in the seriousness of A's offending and he had no
               regard for his family, the victim, or the law of the UK.


            29.   Mrs Williams drew my attention to the  Judge's  sentencing
               remarks.  Evidently, A's family had no control or  influence
               over him and there is no reason to suppose that  they  would
               be able to control him now if he were to remain here.


            30.    While  in  custody,  A  has  been  the  subject  of   two
               adjudications as a result of which his time in  custody  was
               extended by 16 days.


            31.   I was referred to the  'Resolve:   post-programme  report'
               dated 14 October 2014 which is described as:


                             "... a moderate intensity cognitive-behavioural
                    intervention that aims to reduce violence in medium-  to
                    high-risk adult male offenders."


            32.   The 'Conclusion' at page 36 says that A's


                             "... violence is considered and thought through
                    beforehand and results from deeply  entrenched  beliefs.
                    It would be important for [A] to challenge these beliefs
                    in order to develop his consequential thinking."


            33.   Page 37 refers to the OASys report that was not  available
           to me but which referred to


                             "... some pro-criminal attitudes evident by the
                    nature of his offence, as  criminal  activity  was  used
                    through the use of violence and aggression in  order  to
                    acquire money".


            34.   The Conclusion at page 38 addressed the importance  for  A
               to challenge  beliefs  which  affect  his  involvement  with
               authority.


            35.   The Summary on page 42 shows


                             "... that one risk factor to be identified  for
                    himself is money as he 'might be blinded and do whatever
                    it takes to get it' and  'not  think  of  consequences'.
                    Money is important to [A] as he is keen to  provide  for
                    his family."


            36.   Mrs Williams concluded  A's  past  behaviour  prompts  the
               likelihood of further offences and A must be regarded  as  a
               danger to the community.


            37.   In  reply,  Counsel  submitted  that  when  assessing  the
               seriousness of A's crimes, account should be  taken  of  all
               the circumstances including the guilty plea;  his  age;  his
               evidence that only shortly beforehand had he learned of  the
               death of his father in 1997; and "that there was a  possible
               financial motive for the offence (as  opposed  to  it  being
               just a violent offence)".


            38.   Counsel submitted that there is a low risk of re-offending
               as A has a good understanding  of  his  area  of  risk,  has
               completed   a   relapse   prevention   plan,   has    gained
               qualifications whilst in custody, and desires  to  obtain  a
               job and support his family, in  addition  to  which  he  has
               completed the Resolve programme.  Moreover,  the  Respondent
               has  failed  to  note  the  efforts  which  A  has  made  to
               rehabilitate himself.



           My Findings: Section 72


            39.   I remind myself that S.72(2) provides that a person  shall
               be presumed  to  have  been  convicted  of  a  "particularly
               serious crime" and to constitute a danger to  the  community
               of  the  United  Kingdom  if  sentenced  to  a   period   of
               imprisonment of at least  two  years.   The  starting  point
               therefore is the threshold of two years:  A was sentenced to
               more than double that period, that  is  to  say  4  years  4
               months and his offences were described by the Judge as "very
               serious indeed".


            40.   The court took full account of A's youth  and  his  guilty
               pleas, and reduced the sentence accordingly from 8 years  to
               4 years and 4 months.  I  reject  the  submission  that  the
               offences to which A pleaded guilty were anything other  than
               "serious" and find that  the  "financial  motive"  for  them
               aggravates rather than mitigates their gravity.


            41.   As for future offending, the evidence before  me  suggests
               that a very real risk remains.  While serving his  sentence,
               A was reprimanded on two occasions  for  his  behaviour  and
               following adjudications, his period in custody was  extended
               for 16 days as a result.


            42.   The Resolve report, page 33  et  seq  of  the  Appellant's
               bundle, was written as A was regarded as "medium-  to  high-
               risk";  his use of violence was found to be "considered  and
               thought through  beforehand"  rather  than  impulsive;   the
               reference to the OASys report on page  37  refers  to  "pro-
               criminal attitudes";  the conclusion at page 38 is that  A's
               beliefs are "so deeply entrenched  that  they  will  require
               significant effort to change";  it is concluded at  page  39
               that he associates with "gang lifestyle".


            43.   On the positive side, it was concluded at page 44  that  A
               has a very good understanding of his area of  risk  and  the
               negative influence that others have upon him.


            44.   I conclude however that, taking into account the proximity
               of A's convictions in 2013 for identical offences  involving
               the use of imitation firearms, his  failure  to  learn  from
               previous sentences, his  failure  to  heed  the  warning  of
               deportation action if he were to  commit  further  offences,
               and his categorisation as a medium  to  high-risk  offender,
               there remains a very real risk of further offending.


            45.   I have  taken  into  account  that  A  has  "a  very  good
               understanding of his area of risk" but I  am  not  satisfied
               that he has taken action to reduce the risk or to change his
               attitude for the better.  The Resolve report speaks  of  his
               propensity to premeditated violence, pro-criminal  attitudes
               and strongly held negative "beliefs" and the tendency to  be
               blinded by money.


            46.   Taking  all  these  factors  into  account  including  the
               "Certificates of achievement" at pages 54-70 of his  bundle,
               I conclude that he has not rebutted the presumption that  he
               has committed particularly serious crimes and  represents  a
               danger to the community.

59. As we have said at para 28 above, Mr Neale did not pursue the  argument
    in the grounds that, in relation to the risk of re-offending, the Judge
    incorrectly  categorised  the  appellant  as  a  "medium  to  high-risk
    offender". He accepted that there was evidence before  the  Judge  that
    the appellant was a medium-risk offender.

60. In relation to the remainder of ground 2, it is said, in essence,  that
    the Judge failed to take into account the following evidence  that  was
    on the positive side and which  significantly  undermined  the  Judge's
    conclusion; that, alternatively, the same positive evidence shows  that
    the Judge misstated the evidence when he said, at para 45, that that "I
    am not satisfied that he has taken action to  reduce  the  risk  or  to
    change his attitude for the better". The  positive  evidence  that  the
    Judge either overlooked, failed to engage  with  or  misstated  is  the
    following:

    a)      The RESOLVE report which states, at page 45 of the  appellant's
          bundle, that he is "very keen to change  his  behaviour  and  work
          towards a pro-social life. This is evident  in  his  behaviour  in
          sessions, his engagement in the programme and  his  completion  of
          the workbook".  In other words, the appellant had taken action  to
          reduce his risk.

    b)      The document at page 51 of the appellant's bundle which  states
          that the appellant had been promoted from a "learner" to  "mentor"
          within the prison.

    c)      The sentence plan  at  page  30  which  demonstrates  that  the
          appellant had made an application so as to improve his skills  and
          has stated that he wishes to undertake a plumbing course.

    d)      The appellant's alternative plan, of being a film producer/work
          in  the  creative  industry,  which   is   corroborated   by   his
          qualification in "Creative Media".

    e)      The positive Incentives and Earned Privileges award (at page 48
          of the bundle) in which his tutor described him as "a  role  model
          student within the education department" who "sets a good  example
          at all times" and "goes the extra mile to complete  personal  work
          to ensure he achieves his goals and targets". The same  tutor  had
          described him (at page 50 of the bundle) as "the most hard working
          student I have come across while delivering Employability  course"
          who "always work [sic] to a perfect standard and takes real  pride
          in his work", being "a positive role model for other  students  to
          follow". Subsequently, the appellant was promoted from  a  Learner
          to a Mentor and a tutor said that "he adds a certain  maturity  to
          the class" and that he "is a  calming  influence  to  others"  who
          "always does what is asked of him".

    f)      The conclusion in the RESOLVE report (at  page  45)  that  "the
          appellant is very keen to change his behaviour and work towards  a
          pro-social life. This is evident in his behaviour in sessions, his
          engagement in the programme and his completion of his workbook."

61. Mr Neale accepted that the Judge was not  obliged  to  refer  to  every
    piece of the evidence and that the Judge  did  refer  to  some  of  the
    positive evidence,  at  para  43  of  his  decision.  Nevertheless,  he
    submitted that the Judge was obliged to engage with  the  evidence  set
    out above because it significantly undermined his conclusions.

62. We do  not  accept  Mr  Neale's  submissions.  The  Judge  specifically
    referred to  the  RESOLVE  report  and  specifically  referred  to  the
    conclusion, at para 43 of his decision. The  fact  that  he  failed  to
    refer in terms to the remainder of the evidence relied  upon  does  not
    mean that he overlooked it. Where a relevant  point  is  not  expressly
    mentioned by the tribunal, the court should be slow to  infer  that  it
    has not been taken into account: MA (Somalia) [2010] UKSC  49  at  para
    49.

63. The Judge saw and heard the appellant give oral evidence. Evidence that
    seems significant to an appellant and his or  her  representatives  may
    not be considered significant by a judge in the context of all  of  the
    evidence that was before him or her.

64. In the instant case, although we have not had the  benefit  of  hearing
    and seeing the appellant give oral evidence, the evidence  relied  upon
    on the appellant's behalf simply cannot be said to be significant  when
    seen against the fact that, as the Judge noted in terms (paras  41  and
    42 of his decision), the appellant was reprimanded on two occasions for
    his behaviour and had his period in custody extended by 16  days  as  a
    result following adjudications; the  RESOLVE  report  stated  that  the
    appellant's use of violence  was  considered  to  be  "thought  through
    beforehand" rather than impulsive; the OASYs  report  referred  to  the
    appellant's "pro-criminal attitudes"; the conclusion at page 38 of  the
    RESOLVE report states that the  appellant's  beliefs  were  "so  deeply
    entrenched that they will require significant effort  to  change";  and
    that he associates with "gang lifestyle".

65. It was the Judge's task to weigh the evidence before him,  decide  what
    weight was to be given to the various aspects of the evidence and reach
    a conclusion. There was no need for him to refer specifically to  every
    piece of the evidence.

66. For all of these reasons, we do not accept that  the  Judge  overlooked
    the positive evidence relied upon on the  appellant's  behalf.  In  our
    judgment, the failure to  refer  in  terms  to  any  such  evidence  is
    consistent with the judge not placing much weight upon it.

67. The contention that the Judge misstated the evidence is advanced simply
    as an alternative to the submission that he overlooked the evidence. In
    effect, the argument is the same. We  do  not  need  to  deal  with  it
    separately.

68.  Even  if  the  Judge  overlooked  the  evidence  relied  upon  on  the
    appellant's behalf (which we  do  not  accept),  the  evidence  is  not
    material to  the  Judge's  finding  on  the  s.72  certificate  on  any
    legitimate view, given the evidence relied upon by the Judge  paras  41
    and 42 of his decision and that the  appellant  committed  two  serious
    offences that led to the deportation action against him notwithstanding
    that he had previously been given a warning.

69. We therefore reject ground 2. The judge did not materially err  in  law
    in reaching his  finding  that  the  appellant  had  not  rebutted  the
    presumption in s.72.

Ground 1

70. Ground 1 challenges the judge's finding that the  cessation  clause  in
    Article 1C(5) of the Refugee Convention and para 339A(v) of  the  Rules
    applies.

71. The judge gave his reasons for his finding at paras 47-64 which read:

      The 2nd Issue: Would deportation breach  the  Refugee  Convention  and
               Articles 2 & 3?

      47.   It is common ground that following  an  appeal,  A  was  granted
               refugee status in 2002 as a dependant  of  his  mother.   As
               appears from the Determination (A's  bundle,  pages  19-24),
               the Immigration Judge hearing A's mother's  appeal  in  2002
               found that she  was  the  niece  of  the  deposed  president
               Lissouba  of  the  UPADS  party  and  that  she  would  face
               persecution upon return to Congo.

       The  question  arises  therefore  whether  the  Respondent  can   now
               discharge the burden of showing that over the last  fourteen
               years, there has been significant and  non-temporary  change
               in the country situation  in  Congo  such  that  a  fear  of
               persecution can no longer be regarded as well-founded.
      48.   I  have  noted  already  the  country  background,  namely  that
               President Nguesso of the PCT party ruled  the  country  from
               1979 to 1992 and from 1997 to date.  President  Lissouba  of
               UPADS was in power from 1992 to 1997 when he was  overthrown
               in a civil war.

      49.   In her letter of 9 February  2015  the  Respondent  referred  to
               Country of Origin Information to the  effect  that  in  2001
               Lissouba was sentenced in absentia to 30 years' imprisonment
               for economic crimes and, although pardoned in 2007, has  not
               returned to the country.  The UPADS  party  however  won  11
               seats there in the 2007 parliamentary election and  7  seats
               in 2013, and thus, although  Mr  Lissouba  is  it  seems  no
               longer president of the country, his  own  party  is  active
               there.

      50.   Mrs Williams referred me to the Country Guidance  given  by  the
               Upper Tribunal in LM (risks on return), Republic of Congo CG
               [2008] UKAIT 00064, the head note of which is as follows:

            "There have been improvements in the human  rights  position  in
               the  Republic  of  Congo  since  the  determination  of  the
               Tribunal in BB (MCDDI  -  Known  Political  Opponent)  Congo
               Brazzaville CG  [2004]  UKIAT  00223  was  promulgated.  The
               conclusion of the  Tribunal  in  BB  that  past  or  present
               membership of an opposition party including the MCDDI  would
               not lead without more to  a  real  risk  of  persecution  on
               return to Brazzaville remains valid.  There continues to  be
               a danger for some political opponents of the current regime.
                The test of whether there  is  a  real  risk  continues  to
               depend  upon  the  individual's   background   and   profile
               including  in  particular  the  extent  of   his   political
               involvement and whether he has or is likely to come  to  the
               attention of the authorities."

      51.   Mrs Williams submitted that A  has  no  political  beliefs,  let
               alone a "political  profile"  in  Congo,  but  is  merely  a
               relative by marriage  of  a  former  president.   He  cannot
               therefore be regarded  as  a  "political  opponent"  of  the
               current regime and thus is not at risk on return.

      52.   Counsel submitted that A's family connection to Mr  Lissouba  is
               highly relevant.  Failed asylum-seekers are questioned  upon
               return and would be under suspicion. A may be regarded as  a
               spy, especially as there are  no  relatives  of  the  former
               president remaining in the country.

      My Findings on the 2nd Issue

      53.   As the Upper Tribunal observed in LM, the test of whether  there
               is a real risk depends upon the  individual  background  and
               profile  including  in  particular   the   extent   of   the
               appellant's political involvement.

      54.   A's background is that he left Congo in 1997 when he was just  2
               or 3 years old;  he spent over four years  in  Gabon  before
               arriving in the UK in 2002.   Since  then  he  has  attended
               school and college and latterly has engaged  in  a  life  of
               crime.  He does not claim to have any interest in  politics,
               either in Congo or the  UK,  and  does  not  belong  to  any
               political party.  At paragraph 19 of his statement  he  said
               that he has not "talked about the happenings in the Congo at
               any great length" and I find that he is wholly detached from
               Congo politics.

      55.   I find that the only matter which may  give  A  a  'profile'  in
               Congo is the family connection to former president Lissouba.
                Mr Lissouba is not a blood relative but is or  was  married
               to A's great aunt Albertine.  A  does  not  share  the  same
               surname as the former president, and the  family  connection
               is by marriage only.  Moreover,  nearly  twenty  years  have
               passed since President Lissouba was  deposed  and,  although
               sentenced in absentia, has since been pardoned and his party
               has participated in national elections in 2007 and 2013.   I
               find that it is less than realistically likely that A  would
               be identified on return as having  a  family  connection  to
               Lissouba (the connection being  by  marriage  only  and  two
               generations apart) but, even if he was, he has no  political
               profile whatsoever and, following LM,  I  have  to  conclude
               that he would not be at real risk upon return.

      56.   I must however consider whether he would be at risk in Congo  as
               a failed asylum-seeker, or for any other reason.

      57.   A relies upon the expert report of Ms Monekosso  dated  7  March
               2016 prepared not for A but rather his brother Jaffrey,  who
               is also the subject of a  Deportation  Order  to  Congo  and
               whose appeal, I am told, is to be heard  here  on  21  April
               2016.

      58.   I note the expert's opinion that the human  rights  position  in
               Congo has improved substantially but that President  Nguesso
               heads a dictatorial regime and that individuals with  "high-
               level opposition connections" are at high risk.  There is  a
               culture of impunity for "abusers".

      59.   At  page  12  of  her  report  the  expert  refers  to  "general
               instability and insecurity risks to most  people  of  Congo"
               but I am bound to note that that is an observation as to the
               general state of the country and does not in  itself  amount
               to persecution.

      60.   The expert suggests however that Jaffrey (and  by  extension  A)
               is a "vulnerable individual" and liable to  persecution  "as
               punishment or  vengeance  for  their  family  member's  past
               activities or connection or as a form of intimidation".

            The expert gives no reason for reaching  that  conclusion.   She
               does not say how Jaffrey's link with his  great-uncle  might
               be identified and, if  it  is,  why  a  young  man  with  no
               political profile whatsoever would be  of  interest  to  the
               authorities, especially when  Mr  Lissouba's  party  has  an
               active role in Congo politics.

      61.   Certainly, the political regime in Congo is far from  ideal  but
               I have found that A has no political profile  save  for  the
               family tie to his great-uncle, deposed twenty years ago.

      62.   The expert says that returning asylum-seekers are  detained  and
               interviewed but, as the Upper Tribunal observed at paragraph
               109 of LM, it would be surprising if  they  were  not.   The
               appellant in LM however had been the secretary of the  MCDDI
               party opposed to the regime in Congo before 2002 and,  since
               her exile from that country, had worked for the president of
               an opposition party abroad.  Plainly, LM had  a  significant
               political profile and consequently her appeal was allowed by
               the Upper Tribunal. By contrast, I have found that A has  no
               active political profile and, although he is  likely  to  be
               interviewed on return, it is less than realistically  likely
               that his family connection to a historical political figure,
               namely Mr Lissouba,  will  result  in  treatment  likely  to
               engage the Refugee Convention or Articles 2 and 3.

      63.   It is suggested on A's behalf that sharing his father's  surname
               would put him at risk.  I reject that contention,  which  is
               not supported by evidence  and  is  wholly  speculative.   I
               infer that A's father was a member  of  UPADS  and  as  that
               party has now returned to legitimate political  activity  in
               Congo, A's link to his father, who died  twenty  years  ago,
               does not realistically put him at risk.

      64.   In conclusion on this issue, I am satisfied that there has  been
               a  significant  and  non-temporary  change  in  the  country
               situation in Congo.  I accept that the  political  structure
               in Congo falls short of western standards and I accept  that
               there is general instability and lack of security,  but  not
               such as to represent a real risk of persecution to A.

72. There are eight strands to ground 1, summarised at para 27  (a)  -  (h)
    above, each of which we will refer to as a "ground" by way of shorthand
    although not individually a "ground" as such.

73. We will deal first with ground 1 a), i.e. the submission that the Judge
    erred by failing  to  apply  the  burden  of  proof  correctly.  It  is
    contended that the burden of proof was upon the respondent to show that
    the circumstances in connection with which the  appellant  was  granted
    refugee status have ceased to exist so that he can no  longer  continue
    to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the Republic of Congo.

74. We reject this submission. We agree  with  Mr  Kotas  that,  given  the
    Judge's finding that the presumption in s.72 had not been rebutted, the
    Judge was confined to considering the Article 3 ECHR  claim.  Mr  Kotas
    did not expand upon his proposition. We are, however, obliged  to  give
    reasons, which are as follows:

    i)      Given our conclusion that the Judge did not materially  err  in
       law in reaching his finding on the s.72 issue, it follows  that  the
       applicant's refoulement to the Republic of  Congo  will  not  be  in
       breach of the obligations of the United Kingdom  under  the  Refugee
       Convention. This is because Article 33(2) of the Refugee  Convention
       provides that the benefit of the non-refoulement provision  may  not
       be claimed by, inter alia, someone  who  having  been  convicted  by
       final judgment of a particularly serious crime constitutes a  danger
       to the community.

    ii)     There was therefore no need  for  the  Judge  to  consider  the
       cessation clause in Article 1C of the Refugee Convention. Whether or
       not the cessation clause  in  the  Refugee  Convention  applied  and
       whether or not the appellant was still a refugee, he could not avail
       himself of the non-refoulement provision in  Article  33(1)  of  the
       Refugee Convention.

    iii)    There was no need for  the  judge  to  consider  the  cessation
       clause in  para  339A(v)  of  the  Rules  either.  This  is  because
       revocation or refusal to renew an  individual's  "grant  of  asylum"
       under para 339A(i)-(vi) only applies to asylum applications made  on
       or after 21 October 2004 and  can  only  relate  to  refugee  status
       granted  under  Council  Directive  2004/83/EC  (the  "Qualification
       Directive") as  distinct  from  refugee  status  under  the  Refugee
       Convention  which  exists  independently  and   does   not   require
       recognition by a signatory State (paras 24-37  of  Dang  (Refugee  -
       query  revocation  -  article  3)  [2013]  UKUT  00043  (IAC)).  The
       appellant was a dependant in his mother's asylum  claim.  Her  claim
       was made before 21 October 2004. Accordingly, the  appellant  was  a
       refugee under the Refugee Convention. He  was  not  granted  refugee
       status under the Qualification Directive.

    iv)     The grounds of appeal to the FtT  did  not  raise  humanitarian
       protection and the Judge therefore did not  deal  with  humanitarian
       protection. In any event, given the finding that the  appellant  had
       not rebutted the presumption in s.72 that he constitutes a danger to
       the community, he is excluded from humanitarian protection  pursuant
       to para 339D(iii) of the Rules because there  are  "serious  reasons
       for considering that he constitutes a danger to the community...".

    iv)     Thus, only the  ECHR  fell  for  consideration  by  the  Judge.
       Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR were raised on the appellant's  behalf.
       It is well-established that a  Tribunal  or  Court  considering  the
       matter looks at the Article 3 risk prospectively at the date of  the
       proceedings and  not  by  reference  to  some  historical  position,
       although the historical position may be  relevant  in  deciding  the
       future risk: para 41 of RY (Sri Lanka) v SSHD  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  81
       agreeing with the Upper Tribunal's consideration of  this  issue  in
       Dang. At paras 40-43 of RY (Sri Lanka), the Court of Appeal rejected
       the  submission  advanced  on  the  appellant's  behalf   that   the
       consequence of the respondent not revoking refugee  status  is  that
       there is a presumption that the refugee's removal would be in breach
       of Article 3.  The same principles must apply to Article 2.

    v)      We have said above why it was not necessary for  the  Judge  to
       have considered the cessation issue  under  Article  1C(5)  or  para
       339A(v) of the Rules. It is  plain  that,  at  paras  47-64  of  his
       decision, the Judge considered Articles 2 and 3 "through  the  lens"
       of Article 1C(5) and para 339A(v) of the  Rules.  By  doing  so,  he
       effectively applied a presumption that removal would be in breach of
       Articles 2 and 3, contrary to RY (Sri  Lanka).  He  still  concluded
       that there was no real risk of a breach of  Articles  2  and  3.  We
       explain below why we have concluded that he did not  materially  err
       in law in reaching his finding that there was  no  real  risk  of  a
       breach of Articles 2 and 3. It follows that, although the Judge  did
       err by effectively applying a presumption of  risk  contrary  to  RY
       (Sri Lanka) and Dang, the  error  was  not  material.  It  does  not
       justify setting aside his decision.

75. We turn to the remainder of ground 1.

76. In relation to ground 1 (b), it is contended that the Judge  failed  to
    consider properly or at all the risk on  return  as  a  result  of  the
    appellant's family connection  with  Mr.  Lissouba;  alternatively,  he
    failed to give sufficient reasons for departing from the finding of the
    Adjudicator in the appeal of the  appellant's  mother,  where  she  was
    found to be are real risk of  persecution  because  she  was  "a  close
    relative of  the  former  President".   Mr  Neale  submitted  that  the
    Adjudicator had  plainly  thought  that  the  appellant's  mother,  and
    therefore it is said, by extension,  the  appellant,  was  sufficiently
    closely  related  to  be  identified  on  return  as  having  a  family
    connection with Mr Lissouba. In this regard, Mr  Neale  drew  attention
    to:

    i)      The Judge's finding  at  para  55,  that,  as  the  appellant's
       relationship  with  Mr  Lissouba  was  "by  marriage  only  and  two
       generations apart", there was no real risk of him  being  identified
       on return.

    ii)     The Judge's finding at para 61  (that  the  appellant  "has  no
       political profile save for the family tie to his  great-uncle")  and
       at para 55 (that "I find that it is less than  realistically  likely
       that [the appellant] would be  identified  on  return  as  having  a
       family connection to Lissouba ... but, even if he  was,  he  has  no
       political profile whatsoever") which, he  submitted,  conflated  two
       separate risk factors, viz, (a) having  a  political  profile  as  a
       result of political activity; and (b) political profile arising from
       a family connection.

77. In the particular circumstances of this case, if there is a  real  risk
    of the appellant's family connection with Mr Lissouba  giving  rise  to
    Article 3 ill-treatment, this may be   either  because  of  the  family
    connection per se or because the appellant  is  perceived  to  have  an
    adverse political opinion on account of his family connection.

78. Accordingly, in our view, ground 1 (b) is linked to ground 1 (c),  that
    the Judge failed to consider whether the appellant may be  at  risk  on
    account of his perceived political opinion due to his family connection
    with Mr Lissouba. We will therefore deal with  ground  1  (b)  and  (c)
    together.

79. Mr Neale submitted that  the  Judge  incorrectly  considered  that  the
    appellant would only be at real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment  if  he
    had an actual political profile of adverse interest to the  authorities
    of the Republic of Congo. Mr Neale submitted that risk categories  were
    not limited to actual political involvement, as is clear from  para  53
    of LM where Mr. Paul Melly (one of the experts before the  Tribunal  in
    LM) said that: "Individuals  could  be  still  seriously  at  risk  for
    particular reasons. For example, there might be a family dispute dating
    back many years, or the risk might arise because of  current  political
    activity and it was in this latter class that  [the  appellant  in  LM]
    fell".

80. Mr Kotas submitted that perceived political opinion is not one  of  the
    risk categories according to the guidance in LM. In our judgement, this
    submission is misconceived. It is axiomatic that a  person  can  be  at
    risk either because of actual political opinion or perceived  political
    opinion. Accordingly, it was not necessary for the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    make that clear in LM.

81. However, we reject Mr Neale's submissions on grounds 1 (b) and (c).  We
    do not accept that the Judge conflated two separate  risk  factors,  as
    contended, or that he failed to consider whether the appellant would be
    at real risk of being perceived to have an adverse political opinion on
    account of his family connection, for the following reasons:

82. It is plain that the Judge was fully aware of the basis of  the  asylum
    claim of the appellant's mother. She  was  someone  who  had  not  been
    politically active and yet she was recognised as a refugee in  February
    2003. This was because the Adjudicator considered that she would be  at
    real risk of persecution because she would be perceived to  be  adverse
    to the  authorities  in  the  Republic  of  Congo  or  because  of  her
    membership of a particular social group, or both,  due  to  her  family
    connection to Mr Lissouba.

83. In his decision, the Judge plainly considered whether the circumstances
    that gave rise to the appellant's mother having a well-founded fear  of
    persecution at the date of the hearing before the Adjudicator  in  2002
    had ceased to exist such that the appellant would not be at real  risk.
    In doing so, he was plainly aware both of the fact that the appellant's
    mother did not have an actual political profile and of the  risk  posed
    by her family connection.

84. It is therefore implicit, on any legitimate view, that  the  Judge  was
    aware that the lack of an actual political profile did  not  mean  that
    the appellant would not be at real risk of such ill-treatment.  He  did
    not need to say so in terms. Likewise, it is implicit that he was aware
    that the appellant's family connection to Mr Lissouba was  relied  upon
    in the appellant's Article 3 claim. It was  the  entire  basis  of  the
    appellant's case before him that this relationship would give rise to a
    real  risk  of  Article  3  ill-treatment  either  on  account  of  the
    relationship per se or because it gives rise to a  perceived  political
    opinion. It is simply inconceivable that the Judge did not have this in
    mind when assessing the future risk, especially given that he is a very
    experienced judge who is undoubtedly well aware that it is possible for
    an individual to be at real risk of treatment in breach of Article 3 on
    account of perceived political opinion as opposed to  actual  political
    opinion and on account of family connection.

85. Furthermore, the Judge referred to the guidance in LM, which  concerned
    the assessment of the risk on account of  an  individual's  "background
    and profile", which  he  specifically  mentioned  at  para  53  of  his
    decision. The fact that the sentence in question at para  53  continued
    "... in particular the extent of the appellant's political involvement"
    does not mean he considered that a real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment
    only arises from actual political activities.

86. When paras 53-64 of the Judge's decision are read as  a  whole,  it  is
    evident that the Judge's mind was directed to the question whether  the
    appellant was at real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment either due to his
    relationship with  Mr  Lissouba  per  se  or  because  of  a  perceived
    political opinion on account of the relationship  notwithstanding  that
    he himself was "wholly detached from Congo politics" (para  54  of  the
    Judge's decision).

87. On any proper and sensible reading of  the  Judge's  decision,  we  are
    satisfied that, in drawing attention to the fact that the appellant was
    not politically active, the Judge was merely  taking  into  account  an
    aspect of the evidence before him to  reach  a  conclusion  as  to  the
    future risk, just as he took into account the relationship between  the
    appellant and Mr Lissouba as an aspect of the evidence before him.

88. There is no question of the Judge departing from  the  finding  of  the
    Adjudicator  that  the  appellant's  mother  was  sufficiently  closely
    related to Mr Lissouba as to be at real risk of persecution in 2002. As
    we have explained above, there is no question of any presumption  being
    applied. The Judge's duty  was  to  assess  the  evidence  before  him,
    including the evidence as to the past and the fact that  the  appellant
    had been granted refugee status in February 2002, and decide the future
    risk of treatment in breach of Article 3. That  is  precisely  what  he
    did.

89. We therefore reject grounds 1 (b) and (c).

90. Grounds 1 (d)-(h) can be dealt with together.

91. It is now time to set out in more detail the reasons why it is said the
    Judge erred in his assessment of the report of Ms Monekosso.  Mr  Neale
    submitted that the Judge materially erred in law in this regard for the
    following reasons:

    i)      He overlooked Ms Monekosso's opinion that the  appellant  would
       be at real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment by  virtue  of  the  fact
       that he is a convicted criminal.

    ii)      He  accepted  that  the  appellant  would  be  likely  to   be
       interviewed on arrival in the Republic of Congo  but  overlooked  Ms
       Monekosso's opinion (at page 189) that returned asylum  seekers  are
       systematically  detained  for   investigative   interview   by   the
       authorities  of  the  Republic  of  Congo  on  arrival   and   often
       transferred to the Direction de la S�curit� du Territoire (DST), the
       country's principal security and intelligence organisation.  In  the
       opinion of Ms Monekosso, detention for interrogation  would  involve
       human rights abuses.

    iii)    At para 55, the Judge said "I find that the only  matter  which
       may give  [the  appellant]  a  'profile'  in  Congo  is  the  family
       connection to former President Lissouba". The Judge failed  to  make
       findings as to whether the  appellant  would  come  to  the  adverse
       attention of the authorities  for  reasons  other  than  his  family
       connection, namely, the length of time he has spent  away  from  the
       Republic of Congo; the fact that he has lived in the United  Kingdom
       as a refugee since a young age; the fact that none of his family has
       returned to the Republic of Congo, despite his uncle having received
       a pardon and that there is background material to  the  effect  that
       those who return from exile may be subject to "harsh treatment".

    iv)     The Judge failed to consider Ms Monekosso's  opinion  (at  para
       202 of her report) that the appellant (for which read: " appellant's
       brother") is likely to be regarded as a spy.

    v)      The fact that "the appellant" [Ms Monekosso  was  referring  to
       the appellant's brother] has  spent  time  in  the  exiled  home  of
       opposition leaders such as Paulin Makaya and Philippe  Bikinkita  as
       well as Mr Lissouba would be a source of suspicion, in the light  of
       the security crackdown surrounding the Presidential elections.

    vi)     The Judge failed to consider the evidence at pages  181-183  of
       Ms  Monekosso's  report  where  she  identified  cases  of  arrests,
       detentions and harassment of opposition politicians and activists.

92. Both the grounds and the skeleton argument pay scant regard to the fact
    that Ms Monekosso's report dated 7 March  2016  was  prepared  for  the
    appeal of the appellant's younger brother, MJ, and not  the  appellant,
    against a decision to  make  a  deportation  order  against  him.   For
    example, at para 10 of the skeleton argument, it is said that it was Ms
    Monekosso's opinion at  page  188-189  that  "the  appellant  would  be
    treated with suspicion on return: namely, his status  as  a  young  man
    with criminal convictions and a background of refugee status, returning
    from the United Kingdom on a laissex-passer", whereas Ms Monekosso  was
    of course referring to the appellant's brother, not the appellant.

93. In deciding whether the Judge  had  materially  erred  in  law  in  his
    assessment of Ms Monekosso's report, we began by reminding ourselves of
    the country guidance given in LM, the head note of which reads.


            There have been improvements in the human rights position in the
           Republic of Congo since the determination of the Tribunal in  BB
           (MCDDI - Known Political Opponent) Congo Brazzaville  CG  [2004]
           UKIAT 00223 was promulgated. The conclusion of the  Tribunal  in
           BB that past  or  present  membership  of  an  opposition  party
           including the MCDDI would not lead without more to a  real  risk
           of persecution on return to Brazzaville  remains  valid.   There
           continues to be a danger for some  political  opponents  of  the
           current regime.  The test  of  whether  there  is  a  real  risk
           continues to depend upon the individual's background and profile
           including in particular the extent of his political  involvement
           and whether he has or is likely to come to the attention of  the
           authorities.

94. It is important to bear in mind that risk as a failed asylum seeker was
    argued before the Tribunal in LM (see, for  example,  para  52  of  the
    decision). We also reminded ourselves of para 80 onwards of LM  insofar
    as this concerned matters of general  application  as  opposed  to  the
    appeal of LM.  The Tribunal said, inter alia, that  the  government  of
    the Republic of Congo allowed opposition parties to operate so long  as
    they did not pose a serious challenge to its hold on power  (para  82).
    At para 83, the Tribunal said:


           In dealing with his overall assessment of the current  situation
           in his report Mr Melly conceded that it  was  clear  that  human
           rights conditions in Congo had improved  to  some  extent.   The
           government had substantially moved away from the extreme  levels
           of repression seen during the earlier  years  after  Mr  Sassou-
           Nguesso's return to power in 1997.  There was no doubt that  the
           opposition parties enjoyed wider freedom of  activity  than  was
           the case until the end of 2002 although Congo was still far from
           being a freely functioning democracy.  There was still a serious
           risk to many individuals because of their own  past  actions  or
           those of family members.  Those suspected of connections to  the
           armed opposition to the  government  were  at  particular  risk.
           There remained a serious risk for individuals who had  acted  in
           ways that  could  spark  the  antagonism  or  suspicion  of  the
           authorities or of members of the pro-government security  forces
           and their families were also at some risk.  The individuals most
           at risk were not senior politicians or public  figures  but  low
           profile individuals  with  a  history  of  committed  opposition
           activity or suspected past links to armed rebel groups  as  they
           were not well-known and their safety could not be monitored.

95. At para 109 of LM, the  Tribunal  said  that  it  accepted  Mr  Melly's
    evidence that returned asylum seekers are questioned and that it  would
    be surprising if they were not. In relation to the  appellant  LM,  the
    Tribunal accepted the evidence of the expert, Mr Paul Melly,  that  she
    would be questioned about what she has been doing since  she  had  last
    been in the country. The Tribunal did not say that  all  returnees  are
    transferred to the DST for interrogation or that this is  a  reasonable
    likelihood for any involuntary returnee.

96. Whilst Ms Monekosso did provide a report that  was  considered  by  the
    Tribunal in LM, this only  concerned  the  authenticity  of  an  arrest
    warrant (para 90), an issue on which the  Tribunal  found  against  the
    appellant LM (para 93).

97. It is therefore important to note that the Tribunal in LM did  not  say
    there is a real risk  of  Article  3  ill-treatment  merely  because  a
    returnee is  a  failed  asylum  seeker  or  merely  because  he/she  is
    returning from the United Kingdom - home to opposition leaders such  as
    Paulin Makaya, Philippe Bikinkita and Mr Lissouba - or  merely  because
    he/she is returning after lengthy residence in  the  country  in  which
    Paulin Makaya, Philippe Bikinkita and Mr Lissouba have been living.

98. There was no evidence before the Judge that the UNHCR  has  recommended
    that returns of any failed asylum  seekers  should  be  suspended.  The
    Judge had a letter dated 14 April 2015 from the UNHCR responding  to  a
    letter from the respondent dated 20 March 2015 by which the  respondent
    advised the UNHCR that she intended to cease  the  appellant's  refugee
    status. Whilst the UNHCR urged the respondent to consider the  evidence
    showing that the security situation in the Republic  of  Congo  remains
    volatile and reassess whether it demonstrates a fundamental and durable
    change in conditions in the Republic of Congo before coming to a  final
    decision on the appropriateness  of  ceasing  the  appellant's  refugee
    status, the UNHCR did not draw attention to the fact that he  had  been
    granted refugee status and had lived in the UK for some years  as  risk
    factors.

99. We  turn  now  to  Ms  Monekosso's  report  which  is  relied  upon  to
    demonstrate that a real risk of such ill-treatment  arises  if  one  or
    more of these facts exist  as  being  sufficient  to  give  rise  to  a
    perception on the part of the authorities in the Republic of Congo that
    the individual is actively opposed to them.

100. Ms Monekosso's opinion that the appellant's brother would  be  regarded
    as a spy is expressed at page 202.  The relevant sentence reads:

           "The fact that [the appellant's brother] and his  family  sought
           asylum in the UK will reinforce the authorities view of  him  as
           those  citizens  now  assimilate   to   Paulin   Makaya.   Their
           suspicions about his views and his activities as a spy would  be
           reinforced by the fact that he has spent time in the  UK,  which
           has been the exiled home of Paulin Makaya  for  example  and  he
           hosted  country  of  both  [Mr   Lissouba]   and   to   Philippe
           Bikinkita,..."

101. It is therefore clear that her opinion that there is a real risk of  MJ
    as a returnee being suspected of being a spy is based on  the  fact  of
    being returned from the UK. This in turn is because the UK is the  home
    of Paulin Makaya and Philippe Bikinkita. She does not  give  any  other
    reasons for her opinion that there is a real risk of MJ being suspected
    of being a spy, nor does she provide any source for this opinion.

102. At page 187 of the appellant's bundle, Ms  Monekosso  responds  to  the
    question: "Failed asylum seeker: Given his length of  absence  and  the
    fact he has been deemed not to need protection any  longer,  it  is  it
    likely [sic] that [MJ] would face additional scrutiny upon  arrival  to
    the Congo?" The following quote (which begins at  page  188)  from  her
    answer to this question represents an important part of the appellant's
    case on ground 1:


           ... in an Embassy such as UK, a permanent country member of  the
           UN Security Council, there are always  intelligence  service  as
           part of the Embassy Staff. This staff will  inform  the  country
           authorities even before [MJ] is returned to  the  Congo.  It  is
           certain  that  [MJ]  will  be  collected  at  the  airport   and
           interrogated by the country [sic]  intelligence  office,  if  he
           were to be returned to the Congo.
           ...
           Police officers are under orders to record  all  information  on
           those who are returned and  mainly  those  with   background  of
           failed asylum cases or former exiled citizens13. The aim of this
           heavy control on returnees is to immediately  identify  all  key
           activists and opposition party's members. They have subsequently
           used  this  data  to  repress  returnees  and  to  paralyse  any
           resistance effort [sic].
           ...
           Therefore, checking  on arrival at Brazzaville airport  is  used
           to identify trouble makers for the ruling regime.  Upon  arrival
           [MJ] [sic] not be able to present a normal  valid  passport  and
           other documentation that gives the  impression  they  have  been
           absent purely for study, social or business purposes. It is  not
           possible for an individual to pass through arrival procedures in
           Congo unnoticed or then to live unnoticed  by  the  authorities.
           Immigration control procedures are rigorous and bureaucratic.


           ... [MJ], as a convicted young man with a background of  refugee
           status in the UK, on his arrival would  be  greeted  with  great
           suspicion. "Expelled, Never to return" in his one  way  laissez-
           passer with a U.K. immigration stamp or possible accompanied  by
           police, a security agent hired for  that  and  many  other  U.K.
           immigration's documents  and  Court  sentence  or  UK  judiciary
           paperwork. There  is  therefore  a  high  risk  for  [MJ]  being
           interviewed on arrival by the Congolese authorities.


           Local security forces, when reading his immigration  file  would
           simply  conclude  that  the  UK  forces  were  not  capable   to
           discipline him. They would certainly take  this  opportunity  to
           harass him and to show him  what  is  done  in  the  country  to
           prevent him to think about any democratic process in the country
           or so called bad behaviours.


           My interview research with  Congolese  contacts  indicates  that
           returned  asylum  seekers  are   systematically   detained   for
           investigative interview by the  Congo  authorities  on  arrival.
           They are often transferred to the Direction de  la  S�curit�  du
           Territoire (DST), Congo's principal  security  and  intelligence
           organisation.


           An individual transferred to the custody of  the  DST  could  be
           held for a prolonged period without access to any form  of  fair
           legitimate aim process or event [sic] to legal advice.  Once  in
           DST custody, some individuals could disappear, permanently.  The
           DST has a poor human rights record and is  not  subject  to  any
           form of effective judicial oversight and accountability.
           ...
           There are many testimonies from returnees that the  U.K.  police
           who accompanied them have left them [sic] on the  hands  of  the
           national police without [sic] secure  them  any  protection  and
           without [sic] border what would happen to them later.
           ...
           I cannot safely disclose my sources for this information. But  I
           can  formally  confirm  that  they  are  highly   credible   and
           experienced independent human rights observers with  a  detailed
           knowledge of the situation on  the  ground  in  Congo  and  with
           direct  personal  observation  [sic]  knowledge  of  the  events
           dealing with the returnees and refugees abroad.

            (our emphasis)

103. The only source given is at footnote 13  which  relates  to  the  first
    sentence of the second paragraph  quoted  above.  This  shows  that  Ms
    Monekosso has relied upon the return of 353 refugees in 1999,  some  17
    years ago. Although she goes on, in footnote 13, to  mention  what  she
    terms "single fact of returnees  such  as  Jeam  Marie  Mokoko,  Paulin
    Makaya? Colonel Ferdinand  Mbahou  or  many  other  troubles  in  Congo
    Brazzaville" the question-mark after the name of Paulin  Makaya  itself
    raises questions. In any event, it is difficult to see how Ms Monekosso
    can justify drawing generalised conclusions from the  return  of  these
    high profile individuals to be able to say that  "police  officers  are
    under orders to record all information on those who are returned."

104. Ms Monekosso gives no reasons for saying  that  MJ  would  be  returned
    with "UK judiciary paperwork".  She appears to be simply speculating.

105. Another section of Ms Monekosso's report that is relied upon begins  at
    page 201 of the bundle.  This reads:


           In my opinion [MJ] would not be able to relocate  internally  in
           the Congo to avoid persecution as he would be  the  target20  of
           the ruling authorities. It should be  noted  that  New  laws  in
           European countries to send back home in  Africa  those  who  are
           convicted put them at risk as many [sic] suspected them for sort
           of radicalisation [sic], Djihadism or able to commit  terrorism.
           These countries are not well organised to control those who  are
           convicted in the UK and security forces feel  offense  [sic]  by
           such returnees. They authorities [sic] take it as being  rubbish
           bins [sic] of their nationals  that  educated  [sic]  to  behave
           badly in their host country. Therefore,  anyone  who  can  raise
           suspicion among security matters is a target for the authorities
           in a country such as Congo Brazzaville under  security  military
           tension.


           ... it would be very difficult for  [MJ]  to  be  [sic]  welcome
           home. He would simply be undesirable. For diplomatic reasons and
           International protocol,  the  Congolese  authorities  would  not
           discuss such matter. However, in the  corridor,  such  returnees
           would be under heavy pressure from the security forces  for  the
           fact that they have been convicted  and  deported  back  in  the
           Congo.


           ... I believe that if [MJ] were to be returned to Congo there is
           a serious risk that he will be detained for interrogation. If he
           is detained, he is almost certain  to  be  subjected  to  severe
           human rights abuse, including physical assault and  inhuman  and
           degrading treatment.


           Even if [MJ] is not detained officially on his return to  Congo,
           he is highly likely  to  suffer  harassment  detention  or  even
           assault on an extra-judicial basis, at the hands  of  government
           elements. The risk of extra-judicial killing cannot be completed
           excluded.


           I believe that he will be regarded by the Congo  authorities  in
           the  current  security  crackdown  for  the  incoming  president
           elections, with good reasons, as a suspected person and a  young
           man in his fighting age, who could be committed opponent of  the
           present government and its army.


           The fact that [MJ] and his family sought asylum in the  UK  will
           reinforce the authorities view of him as those citizens who  now
           assimilate to Paulin Makaya. Their suspicions  about  his  views
           and his activities as a spy would be reinforced by the fact that
           he has spent time in the UK, which has been the exiled  home  of
           Paulin Makaya for example and the hosted country for both former
           president Lissouba and to Philippe  Bikinkita,  former  founding
           commander of the Ninja militia and close  relative  of  opposite
           leader Bernard Kol�las.


           The  authorities  will  certainly  suspect  that  [MJ]  has  had
           contacts with the exiled opposition  leadership.  [MJ]  will  be
           regarded as a possible source of information on  the  opposition
           both in Congo and the exiled opposition in Europe.


           There is no assurance that deported person such as [MJ], with  a
           convicted sentence and deported  by  force  in  his  country  of
           origin would be treated correctly in the Congo  as  an  innocent
           civilian. These  factors  place  [MJ]  at  high  risk  of  being
           detained for questioning, either on an official basis or  on  an
           extra-judicial basis.


           ...


           As a convicted young from the  UK,  [MJ]  is  also  at  risk  of
           suffering vengeance attack by elements in the  security  forces,
           on his arrival. Vengeance attacks and extra-judicial killings by
           hard-line security elements remain a feature of Congo.


           Even if [MJ] is not detained, he will  be  at  serious  risk  of
           informal persecution...


           For these reasons, I believe that [MJ] is at high risk of  being
           detained on arrival in Congo. I believe that he will be seen  as
           a potential troublemaker and an adherent of a group that is seen
           as subservice and a challenge to the official power structure.


            (our emphasis)

106. In this section of her report, the only "source" given is  at  footnote
    20 which relates to the first sentence quoted above. Footnote  20  does
    not in fact  give  a  source.  Astonishingly,  it  simply  repeats  the
    information contained in the paragraph in the main body of  the  report
    where the footnote appears. Footnote 20 reads:


           Anyone who can raise  suspicion  among  security  matters  is  a
           target  for  the  authorities  in  a  country  such   as   Congo
           Brazzaville under security military tension.  In  addition,  New
           laws in European countries to send back home in Africa those who
           are convicted put them at risk as many [sic] suspected them  for
           sort of  radicalisation  [sic],  Djihadism  or  able  to  commit
           terrorism. These countries are not  well  organised  to  control
           those who are convicted in  the  UK  and  security  forces  feel
           offense [sic] by such returnees. They authorities [sic] take  it
           as being rubbish bins [sic] of  their  nationals  that  educated
           [sic] to behave badly in their host country.

107. The similarity between the contents of footnote 20 and the contents  of
    the paragraph to which it  relates  is  obvious.  If  footnote  20  was
    intended to provide a source for the information  in  the  sentence  to
    which it relates, it does not in fact provide a source.

108. Accordingly, it is clear that the entire case for the  appellant  rests
    on a report produced for his brother in circumstances where no  sources
    are provided for the key passages relied  upon,  save  in  relation  to
    footnote 13 which we have dealt with. Ms Monekosso gives no explanation
    about the origin of the information obtained  or  the  steps  taken  to
    verify the information save that,  in  relation  to  her  opinion  that
    returned asylum seekers are "systematically detained for  investigative
    interview" with the authorities on arrival and "often  transferred"  to
    the DST, she says she "cannot safely disclose her sources".

109. At page 167 of the bundle,  Ms  Monekosso  says  "I  am  familiar  with
    Congolese society and I have  stayed  in  Congo  Brazzaville  for  five
    years, where I studied journalism at the  University  of  Brazzaville".
    However, she does not say when she lived in Congo Brazzaville.  In  her
    report, she makes several references  to  having  obtained  information
    from interviewees but she does not explain when these  interviews  took
    place. This is not an insignificant point given that footnote 13 refers
    to events in 1999.

110. At page 174, Ms Monekosso says that  MJ  is  vulnerable  but  does  not
    explain why. At page 175, she says:

                 "There are general  instability  and  insecurity  risks  to
           most people in Congo. But these are not the reason [sic]  of  my
           conclusion about his safety. He is  at  risk  for  the  specific
           reasons outlined above. For the  reasons  I  have  given  in  my
           report, it is my belief that if [MJ] is returned to the Republic
           of Congo, he is at high risk of being  detained,  on  either  an
           official or extra-judicial basis. If he is detained he  will  be
           at extremely serious risk of suffering human rights abuse.  Even
           if he is not detained, he will be at serious risk  of  suffering
           extra-judicial harassment, persecution and assault  by  elements
           of the government security forces. ...

                 ... The evidence of numerous individual cases mentioned  in
           this report has shown that ordinary citizens are at high risk of
           suffering human rights abuse. I have seen detailed  evidence  of
           numerous cases of detention, torture and harassment suffered  by
           army officers or solders on innocent citizens....

                 Vulnerable individuals such as  [MJ]  who  is  a  convicted
           young man in the UK would be persecuted either as punishment  or
           vengeance  for  their  family   members   past   activities   or
           connections or as a form of intimidation,  to  deter  them  from
           "causing trouble" in the future.

            (our emphasis)

111. Ms Monekosso's opinion that "ordinary citizens  are  at  high  risk  of
    suffering human rights abuses" is simply not supported by anything said
    in the earlier part of her report.  The  only  evidence  of  individual
    cases she mentioned in her report appear later in her report, where she
    mentions Paulin Makaya (for example, at pages 176  and  182),  founding
    president of  the  Congolese  Movement  for  Democracy  and  Integrated
    Development (MCDDI party), and Modeste Boukadia (page  181),  President
    of the National Council of State of South Congo and Circle of Democrats
    and Republicans of Congo and various individuals mentioned at page  183
    described as "political prisoners". Indeed, she specifically  says  (at
    page 173) that "general levels  of  serious  human  rights  abuse  have
    reduced" and "there is a high risk to individuals  seen  as  likely  to
    have high-level opposition connections or seen as likely to assist  the
    campaign of opposition movements in a  practical  manner".  Whilst  the
    examples she gave in her report are consistent with the guidance in LM,
    that individuals who are opposition activists are  at  real  risk,  her
    view that ordinary civilians are at "high risk" goes  well  beyond  the
    country guidance. Nowhere in her reports does  she  describe  precisely
    what evidence she relies upon for her view that ordinary civilians  are
    at high risk of human rights abuses.

112. We  have  also  taken  into  account  the  following  assessments  made
    previously of the evidence of Ms Monekosso:

    i)      In MD (Women)  Ivory  Coast  CG  [2010]  UKUT  215  (IAC),  the
       Tribunal received written and oral evidence from Ms Monekosso as  an
       expert witness. At paras 83-93, the Tribunal sets out Ms Monekosso's
       description of  her  background.  The  Tribunal  then  assessed  her
       evidence. It plainly had serious difficulties with her evidence.  We
       have set out at Appendix A to this decision paras 76 to 215  of  MD,
       for convenience. It  suffices  for  us  to  draw  attention  to  the
       following difficulties by way of summary:

      a)    The Tribunal considered that it was clear from  Ms  Monekosso's
             oral evidence that, contrary to her first report which conveyed
             the impression that she had had face-to-face meetings with  the
             President of the  Ivory  Coast,  its  Prime  Minister,  Foreign
             Minister and other senior government officials,  it  was  clear
             from her cross-examination that the meetings that occurred were
             with a group of 200 journalists of which Ms Monekosso  was  one
             and that she  had  not  personally  spent  any  time  with  the
             President on her visit to the  Ivory  Coast  in  December  2007
             (paras 96 and 97).

            b)   Ms Monekosso informed the Tribunal that the  only  evidence
             she had on the issue in the case  came  from  a  Miss  Diabate.
             However, Ms Monekosso had not  informed  Miss  Diabate  of  the
             purpose of the interview. Indeed, the Tribunal  found  that  Ms
             Monekosso had misled Miss Diabate as  to  the  purpose  of  the
             interview (para 177). Having obtained the information from Miss
             Diabate, Ms Monekosso did  not  appear  to  have  attempted  to
             verify it through any independent sources (para 213).

            c)   The Tribunal drew the conclusion  from  her  oral  evidence
             that Ms Monekosso was prepared to mislead an interviewee in the
             course of journalism on the basis that the means justified  the
             ends (para 181).

            d)   It became apparent to  the  Tribunal  that  Ms  Monekosso's
             direct knowledge of matters relating to the Ivory Coast was  in
             fact limited (para 176).

            e)   In the judgment of the Tribunal, "Ms  Monekosso's  approach
             was not only misleading and regrettable but also prejudiced the
             integrity of the information provided" (para 185).

            f)   There was more than one instance of Ms  Monekosso  using  a
             source material that in fact related to another  country  (para
             192).

            g)   Ms Monekosso's errors went "beyond the mere  typographical"
             (paragraph 204.

      ii)   The Tribunal in MD  concluded  that  her  evidence  fell  to  be
       treated with caution (para 170), that "[t]here is something  of  the
       campaigner in her, seeking to advance the cause of women  in  Africa
       for which she must be applauded but in our view this has led to  the
       loss, in part, of a rigorously objective approach"  (para  208)  and
       that "Ms Monekosso's evidence should be approached with care"  (para
       217).

      iii)  MD went on appeal to the Court of Appeal in MD (Ivory  Coast)  v
       SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 989. The Tribunal's assessment of the  evidence
       of Ms Monekosso was not the subject of challenge.

      iv)   Ms  Monekosso  had  previously  given  expert  evidence  to  the
       Tribunal in SK (FGM, ethnic groups) Liberia CG  [2007]  UKAIT  0001.
       One issue before the Tribunal was whether a  small  sub-set  of  the
       Krahn tribe practised female genital mutilation (FGM) even though as
       a general matter the Krahn tribe may not practise it. On this issue,
       the Tribunal said that it did  not  consider  that  any  significant
       weight could be  placed  upon  the  report  of  Ms  Monekosso  whose
       description of where Sinoe - the place - was located was accepted on
       behalf of the claimant in  that  case  to  be  wrong.  The  Tribunal
       further said that the passage of Ms Monekosso's report in which  she
       dealt with Sinoe generally lacked coherence (para 55).

113. We have concluded that the difficulties  we  have  described  with  the
    report Ms Monekosso prepared for MJ and that was  relied  upon  in  the
    appeal before the Judge, when seen in the context of the problems  with
    her expert evidence  previously  identified  by  the  Tribunal  in  the
    country guidance case of MD  and  the  fact  that  the  UNHCR  has  not
    recommended that removals to the Republic of Congo be suspended, are so
    significant that, on any legitimate  view  of  the  evidence  that  was
    before the Judge, her report was  wholly  insufficient  to  demonstrate
    that there was a real risk that the appellant  would  be  subjected  to
    Article 3 ill-treatment merely because he  may  be  seen  as  a  failed
    asylum seeker or an expelled refugee or merely because he is  returning
    from the United Kingdom where other leading figures opposition  figures
    have been or are still in exile or merely because he would be returning
    after a lengthy residence in the UK or merely because he is a convicted
    criminal.

114. We turn to consider the evidence as to  more  recent  events  that  was
    before the Judge (i.e. pages 71-163 of the  bundle).  A  referendum  to
    amend the constitution was held on 25 October 2015 which was  boycotted
    by  the  main  opposition  coalition.  It  was  the  subject  of  major
    demonstrations. The amendment was nevertheless passed on 27 October and
    confirmed  by  the  Constitutional  Court  on  6  November  2016.  This
    amendment enabled President Ngeussou in November  2015  to  run  for  a
    third term in the Presidential elections held in March 2016. There  was
    unrest in the country with many demonstrations and a crackdown  by  the
    government on opposition activists, in the run-up to the referendum and
    the presidential elections, with arbitrary arrests  and  detentions  of
    political activists. For example, the Press release  dated  2  November
    2015 (page 92) from the International Federation for Human Rights  says
    that, in  the  period  prior  to  the  referendum,  there  was  violent
    repression  of  peaceful  demonstrations.  The  Amnesty   International
    bulletin dated 1 February 2016 (pages 82-83) refers to clashes  between
    the security forces and protesters which led to the death of  at  least
    16 protesters and bystanders in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire alone.  In
    its bulletin dated 31  March  2016  (page  71),  Amnesty  International
    states that the results of the Presidential election on 20  March  2016
    were rejected by the opposition and that the Congolese authorities have
    conducted a series  of  arrests  against  leading  opposition  figures,
    including senior campaign officials of opposition candidates as well as
    other activists and protesters.

115. In our view, there is nothing in this background  material  that  shows
    that there is a real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment for  any  returnee
    simply because he/she is returning as a refugee who is  being  expelled
    or as a failed asylum seeker or as a convicted  criminal  or  on  being
    returned after a lengthy absence or by reason  of  the  fact  that  the
    individual is being returned from the UK.

116. In our judgment, the  evidence  at  pages  71-163  of  the  appellant's
    bundle shows that it continues to be the case, as was  decided  in  LM,
    that those at real risk are individuals who  are  actively  opposed  as
    well as those who are at real risk of being perceived  to  be  actively
    opposed to the authorities in the Republic of Congo. It continues to be
    the case that the individual's background and profile -  in  our  view,
    this includes the individual's past and any family connections  -  will
    require assessment to decide whether there is  a  real  risk  that  the
    individual will be perceived to be in opposition to the authorities. As
    the Tribunal said in LM, the individuals most at risk are  low  profile
    individuals with a history of committed opposition activity.

117. In assessing the future risk of ill-treatment, the  Judge  was  plainly
    aware that the appellant was a convicted criminal. He was plainly aware
    that the appellant had  been  granted  refugee  status.  He  took  into
    account (at para 62) the appellant's relationship with Mr Lissouba, who
    he correctly described as a "historical figure" given  that  there  was
    nothing in the background before the Judge to show that Mr Lissouba has
    participated, whether from the UK or by returning to  the  Republic  of
    Congo, in any activities against the authorities  in  the  Republic  of
    Congo in the years that have elapsed since the appellant's  mother  was
    granted refugee status. The Judge correctly said (at para 55) that  the
    relationship with Mr Lissouba was by marriage only -  since  dissolved,
    we observe - and two generations apart. He was plainly aware  that  the
    appellant would be returning after a lengthy absence from the  UK.  The
    Judge found that, although the appellant is likely to be questioned  on
    return,  it  was  less  than  realistically  likely  that  his   family
    connection to Mr  Lissouba  will  result  in  treatment  in  breach  of
    Articles 2 and 3. He considered whether the  fact  that  the  appellant
    shares the same surname as his  father  puts  him  at  real  risk.  His
    conclusion was open to him on the evidence  before  him  including  the
    recent background and the report of Ms Monekosso.

118. It would have been preferable if the Judge had engaged  with  the  more
    recent background before him and in greater detail with the  report  of
    Ms Monekosso; in particular, if he had engaged with  her  opinion  that
    the appellant is at  real  risk  as  a  returnee  who  is  a  convicted
    criminal. Nevertheless, having considered the more recent evidence  and
    Ms Monekosso's report ourselves, we have concluded that the  Judge  did
    not err in law. Even if we are wrong about that, we are satisfied  that
    any error was not material for the reasons we have given.  There  would
    be no reason for the appellant to lie about his  background,  including
    the fact that he was granted refugee status 13 years ago when he was  a
    young  boy,  on  being  interviewed  on  arrival.  The  Judge  did  not
    materially err in law in finding that  the  appellant's  background  is
    less than realistically likely to lead to a real risk of  a  breach  of
    Articles 2 and 3.

119. As we have said above, the decision of Judge Murray in MJ's appeal  was
    produced at the hearing before  us.  Mr  Kotas  objected  to  it  being
    admitted in evidence.

120. Mr Neale submitted that the errors of  law  contended  in  grounds,  in
    relation  to  the  Judge's  (i.e.  Judge  Troup's)  assessment  of   Ms
    Monekosso's report, were material given that Judge Murray had  accepted
    the expert opinion of Ms Monekosso.

121. Judge Murray said at para 44 of her  decision  that  she  accepted  the
    expertise of Ms Monekosso relying upon the fact that she gave  evidence
    in LM. She failed to note that Ms Monekosso's evidence to the  Tribunal
    in LM appears to have been limited to the authenticity  of  the  arrest
    warrant, an issue on which the Tribunal concluded against the  claimant
    in that case. Her misapprehension about the role  that  Ms  Monekosso's
    evidence played in LM may explain why she accepted the totality  of  Ms
    Monekosso report without subjecting it to any analysis, saying, at para
    46 "I find that the expert's  report  is  sourced  and  well-reasoned".
    However, even if we are wrong in saying  that  Judge  Murray  may  have
    misapprehended the role that the evidence of Ms Monekosso played in LM,
    this makes no difference for the following reasons:

122. Where the outcome of an asylum claim depends on the credibility of  the
    facts relied upon, different judges faced with substantially  the  same
    facts or evidence may on entirely rational grounds  come  to  different
    conclusions: Otshudi v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 893. In MJ  (Iran)  v  SSHD
    [2008] EWCA Civ 564, the Court of Appeal said, at paras 15 and 16, that
    it is "undesirable but unfortunately not uncommon in the asylum  system
    to find that siblings or spouses' appeals have been  separately  heard.
    .... In principle no factual res judicata or issue estoppel is  created
    by one determination in relation to others."

123. We are, of course, mindful of the fact that, unlike Otshudi,  there  is
    no dispute as to the facts upon which the appellant and  MJ  sought  to
    resist their deportation under Article 3.  The  different  outcomes  of
    their appeals were due only to the different approaches of  the  judges
    to the same report from  Ms  Monekosso.  The  fact  that  Judge  Murray
    accepted the evidence of Ms Monekosso cannot, without more, demonstrate
    that  the  Judge  materially  erred  in  law.   Furthermore,   in   the
    circumstances of this case, given the difficulties with Ms  Monekosso's
    report that we have explained and  given  the  difficulties  previously
    found by the Tribunal  with  the  evidence  of  Ms  Monekosso,  we  are
    satisfied that the fact that Judge  Murray  uncritically  accepted  the
    report of Ms Monekosso does not mean that the Judge materially erred in
    law in his assessment of her report or in reaching his conclusion  that
    the appellant was not at real risk of Article 3  ill-treatment  in  the
    Republic of Congo. There was therefore no prejudice to  the  respondent
    by our admitting the decision of Judge Murray.

124. Ground 1 therefore fails.

125. We turn to ground 3.

Ground 3

126.  Ground 3 challenges the Judge's decision on the appellant's Article  8
    claim. The judge gave his reasons for  finding  that  the  decision  is
    proportionate at paras 65-80 of his decision, which read:


       The 3rd Issue:  Article 8


      65.   Counsel helpfully set  out  at  paragraph  33  of  her  skeleton
         argument that due to the fact that A's sentence is one of 4  years
         and 4 months' imprisonment, paragraph 398 of  the  Rules  provides
         that deportation is conducive to  the  public  good.   Given  that
         paragraphs 399 and 399A do not apply, it  will  only  be  in  very
         compelling circumstances that his  right  to  family/private  life
         would outweigh the public interest in deportation.


      66.   It is A's case that his circumstances are very compelling:   the
         Respondent says that they are not.


      67.   As for the Respondent's case, at paragraph  54  et  seq  of  her
         letter of 13 November 2015, the Respondent  observed  that  A  has
         neither family life with children nor a partner.


      68.   A's mother claimed in her witness statement to suffer  from  HIV
         and needs the support of her son.   Mrs  Williams  submitted  that
         that claim is not corroborated, but in any event  A  has  been  in
         detention since 2013 and his mother had been able to cope  without
         him.


      69.   The Republic of Congo is a Francophone country:  in evidence,  A
         had said that although he can understand French he is only able to
         speak a little of  the  language.   Mrs  Williams  submitted  that
         French was A's only language until he arrived in the UK in 2002 at
         the age of 7.  French is his mother's primary language,  a  French
         interpreter had been requested for her and  it  is  reasonable  to
         conclude that A speaks to her in her own language.


      70.   Mrs Williams went on to submit that A has received an  education
         in the UK; he has gained GCSEs and has gained the certificates  of
         achievement, to be found at pages 54-70 of  his  bundle.   It  was
         submitted that he can benefit from the skills that he has  learned
         here, upon his return to Congo.


      71.   The expert report at page 29 refers  to  the  high  unemployment
         rate in Congo and describes the "poor  quality  of  education  and
         training" there as "major obstacles".  Mrs Williams submitted that
         A by contrast has had a full  education  and  will  thus  have  an
         advantage on the labour market in Congo.


      72.   On A's behalf, Counsel submitted that A has resided  in  the  UK
         since the age of 7, he has not visited Congo since he was 2  or  3
         years old, he has no knowledge of the culture of that country, his
         conduct in prison has been "excellent", A's  mother  and  siblings
         all have refugee status in the UK and would be unable to visit him
         in Congo, and he has no friends or family in that country.


      73.   I was  referred  to  JZ  (Zambia)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  116  which
         concerned a Zambian youth who had committed an offence in  the  UK
         at the age of 17 and was sentenced to  4�  years,  having  arrived
         here when he was 9 never having returned to Zambia.  The Court  of
         Appeal found that the private  life  considerations  at  paragraph
         399A are capable of constituting exceptional circumstances  should
         the Tribunal consider them to be so.


      74.   I am required by section 117A of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002 to have regard to the considerations listed in
         sections 117B and C.


      75.   With regard to 117B, I accept that A speaks English  to  a  good
         standard but I go on to  find  that  he  is  not  yet  financially
         independent.


      76.   As for 117C(6), A is a foreign criminal who has  been  sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of at least four years and in his case
         the public interest requires deportation  unless  there  are  very
         compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described   in
         Exceptions 1 and 2.


      77.   By section 117C(4), Exception 1 applies where:


            (i)   C has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of  his
         life,


            (ii)  he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK, and


             (iii)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   his
            integration into the country to which  he  is  proposed  to  be
            deported.


      78.   I note that the provisions of Exception 1 match  paragraph  399A
         of the Immigration Rules. Following JZ (Zambia), I find  that  the
         correct approach in applying rules 398 to 399A of the  Immigration
         Rules is not to carry out a freestanding analysis of the Article 8
         factors. The Secretary of  State  had  already  carried  out  that
         exercise in drafting  rules  398  to  399A.  Those  rules  form  a
         complete code explaining how article 8 operates in cases  where  a
         foreign criminal is resisting deportation. The decision-maker must
         take account of the proposed deportee's Convention rights  through
         the lens of the Immigration Rules. The rules  emphasize  the  high
         public interest in deporting foreign criminals. In a case to which
         rules 399 and 399A do not apply, very compelling reasons  will  be
         required if they are  to  constitute  "exceptional  circumstances"
         which outweigh the public interest in deportation.


      79.   At paragraph 35 of her skeleton, Counsel lists "very  compelling
         circumstances" which I have considered and find as follows:


            (i)   A, who is now aged 21, has resided here since the  age  of
         7:


                  I accept that A has spent 2/3rds of his life here and only
            1/3rd in Africa (the Congo about 2 years, Gabon about 4 years).
            Thus, it can be said that he has been  lawfully  resident  here
            for most of his life but it cannot be said that he has  adopted
            the social and cultural norms of the UK: he has had a wholesale
            disregard for the law and has committed very serious  offences,
            and repeated the offence of carrying an imitation firearm  with
            intent soon after his release from Youth custody  in  2013.  He
            paid no heed to the  Respondent's  warning  that  he  would  be
            deported if convicted of further offences. In  considering  A's
            circumstances and background, I  find  that  they  are  not  so
            compelling as to  be  outweighed  by  the  public  interest  in
            deportation


            (ii)  A has no knowledge of the language or culture of Congo:


                  I find that the language in that country is  French,  that
            that was A's only language until he arrived in the  UK  at  the
            age of 7 and, although A  has  told  me  in  evidence  that  he
            understands French but is only able to speak a little,  I  find
            it to be more than realistically likely that he converses  with
            his mother in French and that his command of  the  language  is
            greater than he suggests. In any event  he  would  be  able  to
            improve his language skills  rapidly  upon  return,  given  his
            background in the language. Moreover, I  find  that  since  his
            arrival in the UK, A has been raised in a  household  with  his
            mother and two siblings who were born in the Congo. It is  more
            than  realistically  likely  therefore  that  his  family   and
            particularly his mother have passed on to him some knowledge of
            the culture of the Congo.


            (iii) A was 19 at the time of the offence and "had youth on  his
         side so as to rehabilitate":


                  I find those to have been the  circumstances  when  A  was
            sentenced, but in the absence of a OASys report  and  objective
            evidence of the prospects of rehabilitation, I do not find them
            to be compelling. He continues to have youth on his side  which
            will enable him to adjust to life in his homeland.


            (iv)  A's conduct since the commission of the offence "has  been
         excellent":


                  Contrary to that submission, I find that A was the subject
            of two Adjudications while serving his sentence as a result  of
            which his release date was put back by 16 days.  I accept  that
            he gained a range of Level 1 City & Guilds  certificates  while
            serving his sentence, but  they  are  neither  exceptional  nor
            compelling.


            (v)   A's mother suffers from HIV and needs A's assistance:


                  I have considered that submission  above  and  have  found
            that A's mother has been able to manage without A's  assistance
            for the last three years.


            (vi)  A's mother and siblings all have refugee status in the UK,
            are not able to travel to Congo and there would be a  permanent
            and irreversible severance of family life:


                  I find that A is now an adult of 21  years  and  that  the
            relationship with his  mother  and  siblings  does  not  extend
            beyond usual family ties and, in  any  event,  contact  can  be
            maintained   by   Skype   and   other   forms   of   electronic
            communication.


            (vii) Length of residence of a nine-year period was accepted  in
            JZ (Zambia) as a factor capable  of  constituting  "exceptional
            circumstances":


                  I find that  having  regard  to  section  117C(6)  and  my
            findings in subparagraph (i) above, the length of A's residence
            in the UK is outweighed by the public interest


            (viii) A has no friends or family in Congo:


                  In evidence, A  told  me  that  he  is  an  ambitious  and
            enterprising young man who seeks to become a film producer.   I
            find that  inevitably  he  will  face  a  difficult  period  of
            adjustment upon arrival in Congo but, in  due  time,  with  the
            social skills and enterprise that he has learnt here, will form
            a private life for himself.


      80.   Having considered A's case with the utmost  care,  I  find  that
         there are no "very compelling circumstances" to  override  section
         117C(6).  The offences that he committed were  extremely  serious.
         He has no partner or children to take into account.  I am bound to
         give the public interest factor the great weight that it  requires
         and accordingly the deportation order must stand and take effect."

127. Ground 3 is that the judge failed to give any or any  adequate  reasons
    for finding that there are no very compelling circumstances to outweigh
    the public interest in deportation, for the following reasons:

    i)      In finding that the  relationship  between  the  appellant  and
          members of his family in the United Kingdom "did not extend beyond
          usual family ties", the Judge failed to give  due  weight  to  the
          evidence of the appellant's mother and  siblings  in  the  witness
          statements in the bundle and failed to treat each family member as
          a victim contrary to Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39. In  reaching  his
          finding that the relationship between the appellant and members of
          his family did not amount to family life, the Judge had failed  to
          take into account / place any weight on the following factors:

      a)    The mother's health is said to be deteriorating as a result  of
             the threat of deportation of her son (para  9  of  her  witness
             statement).

      b)    Financial support would not be available to the appellant  upon
             return to the Republic of Congo, as stated in cross-examination
             at the hearing.

            c)   The appellant's family would effectively be broken up as a
             result of his deportation and the effect that this  would  have
             on family members, according to para 20 of the statement of the
             appellant's older sister (at page 15 of the bundle).

            d)   The Judge failed to consider whether Skype and  electronic
             means  of  communication  were  viable   /   available   before
             indicating that this would remedy any severance of family life.
             The applicant's older sister had said in her witness statement,
             at para 17, that "Keeping in touch if he  was  not  in  the  UK
             would be difficult, everyone has their own lives and we  cannot
             continue to keep in touch only over the phone".

    ii)     In finding at para 79 (viii) "I find that  inevitably  he  will
       face a difficult period of adjustment upon arrival in Congo but,  in
       due time, with the social skills and enterprise that he  has  learnt
       here, will form a private life for himself",  the  Judge  failed  to
       consider the fact that the appellant had never had to integrate into
       a new society and/or culture as an adult and that he would therefore
       face  particular  difficulties  over  and  above  a  normal   robust
       individual being returned to their country of origin.

128. There is simply nothing in the challenge to the  Judge's  finding  that
    the appellant did not enjoy family life with his mother  and  siblings.
    The factors listed at i) a)-d)  of  the  preceding  paragraph  are  not
    relevant to any assessment of whether family  life  is  being  enjoyed,
    although they may be relevant to proportionality.

129. We have set out  above  (para  41)  paras  9  and  19  of  the  witness
    statement of the appellant's mother. It is plain that she did  not  say
    anything that demonstrates that she and the appellant enjoy family, nor
    did his sister. The Judge therefore did not err in law  in  failing  to
    refer to their evidence at para 79 (vi) when he made  is  finding  that
    family life was not being enjoyed. We are satisfied that he did not err
    in law in reaching his finding that family life is not being enjoyed.

130. In relation to proportionality, it is necessary to  remember  that  the
    appellant received a total sentence of 4 years  6  months.  This  means
    that para 398 of  the  Rules  required  him  to  show  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in paras 399 and 399A.

131. The Judge was plainly aware that  his  decision  would  result  in  the
    break up of the appellant's family, as para 79  (vi)  of  his  decision
    where he referred it contact being maintained by  Skype,  demonstrates.
    He did take into account the health of the appellant's mother  at  para
    179 (v). We therefore reject the submission  that  he  failed  to  take
    these matters into account or the effect that separation would have  on
    the members of this family. That just  leaves  the  evidence  given  in
    cross-examination that the appellant would not have financial  support.
    However, the Judge noted that the appellant had said in evidence  (para
    179(viii) of his decision) that the appellant had told him that  he  is
    an ambitious and enterprising young man who  seeks  to  become  a  film
    producer. There is therefore nothing in this point. The suggestion that
    the Judge failed to take into account that the appellant has never  had
    to integrate into a new society amounts to no more than an  attempt  to
    re-argue the evidence.

132. The submission that the Judge  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for
    finding that there are no very compelling circumstances to outweigh the
    public interest fails to reflect the  correct  question,  i.e.  whether
    there were very compelling circumstances over and above those described
    in paras 399 and 399A. That is the question the  Judge  considered.  In
    our judgement, he gave adequate reasons.

133.  We therefore reject ground 3.

      Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point  of  law.  The  appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is therefore dismissed.

Extracts from MD (Women) Ivory CG [2010] UKUT 215 (IAC)

"Assessment of Evidence of Ms Ticky Monekosso

76.   We need to make some comments about our approach to the oral  evidence
    and reports of Ms Monekosso who explains that she was  commissioned  to
    write her reports by the appellant's solicitors in her capacity  as  an
    independent expert on the affairs of the Ivory Coast.

77.   There are a number of general  observations  that  we  would  wish  to
    make.   Our starting point  is  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    Practice Directions where at paragraph 8A.4 (now Practice Direction  10
    of February 2010) it  is  stated  that  an  expert  should  assist  the
    Tribunal by providing an objective, unbiased opinion on matters  within
    his or her expertise and should not assume the role of an advocate.

78.   Practice Direction 8A.5 (now 10.5) reminds us that  an  expert  should
    consider all material facts, including those which might  detract  from
    his or her opinion.  Paragraph 9A.6  (now  10.6)  points  out  that  an
    expert should make it clear:

    a)      when a question of issue falls outside his  or  her  expertise;
        and


    b)      when the expert is not able to reach a  definite  opinion,  for
        example because of insufficient information.


79.   The role of a country expert is thus to  assist  the  Tribunal  giving
    expert evidence in a field where specialist knowledge is  required,  in
    particular providing comprehensive  and  balanced  factual  information
    relating to the issues that the Tribunal must resolve.


80.   In that regard, it is important to bear in  mind  that  the  UTIAC  is
    itself a specialist Tribunal that has its own level  of  expertise  and
    therefore it is for the Tribunal on the basis of the  totality  of  the
    material before it, including the opinion of  the  country  expert,  to
    conduct its own assessment and reach its own conclusions.

81.   A competent expert's report is always  entitled  to  respect  and  due
    consideration but from the point of  view  of  the  judicial  decision-
    maker, such reports may sometimes (if not often) amount in the  end  to
    just one among other items of evidence which have to be weighed in  the
    balance.

82.   As held by the Tribunal in SK [2002] UKAIT 05613, the Tribunal  builds
    up its own expertise.  Naturally an expert's  report  can  assist,  but
    that does not mean that heavy reliance  is  or  should  necessarily  be
    placed on such reports.  All will depend upon the nature of the  report
    and the particular expert.  The Tribunal is accustomed to being  served
    with reports of experts, many of whom have their  own  points  of  view
    which the reports seek to justify.  The  whole  point  of  the  country
    reports is to bring together all relevant  material.   From  them,  the
    Tribunal will reach its own conclusions  about  the  situation  in  the
    country and they will see whether the facts found in  relation  to  the
    individual before it establish to the required standard, a real risk.

83.   Ms Monekosso described herself as  an  independent  journalist  and  a
    French citizen,  originally  from  Cameroon.   She  told  us  that  her
    professional experience and knowledge has been  accumulated  over  more
    than twenty years as  an  independent  journalist  reporting  on  human
    rights, development issues and related humanitarian affairs in  Africa.
    She stated that she had visited many African  countries  on  a  regular
    basis.  Ms Monekosso described her  career  background  as  that  of  a
    freelance journalist and independent consultant with a number of  media
    groups, international organisations, non-government  organisations  and
    the private sector for twenty years.


84.   Ms Monekosso holds a Masters Degree in Mass Communication Studies  and
    Journalism, a post graduate Diploma in Audio-visual Communication, post
    graduate studies in Communications and Cultures, post graduate  studies
    in Applied Anthropology as well as a Graduate Diploma in Economics  and
    other qualifications.

 85.   She states that she has prepared a number of research studies on  the
    United Nations Information System.

86.   Ms Monekosso obtained  an  International  Press  Award  in  2000.   Ms
    Monekosso was a Programme Support Officer (1993-1995) with the Regional
    Bureau for Africa and the Middle East at the International Organisation
    for Migration (IOM) Geneva Headquarters, gathering information on human
    rights and historical research on migrations in Francophone Africa  and
    Maghreb countries.

87.   Ms Monekosso worked as an  independent  consultant  in  communications
    with public information organisations in  what  she  describes  as  the
    "United Nations System" including the United Nations Information Centre
    (UNIC/Brazzaville),  the  UN  Information  Office  (Geneva)  and  other
    associated organisations.

 88.  Ms Monekosso is a founding member of Femmes  Africa  Solidarit�  (FAS)
    that she describes as a Geneva-based African women's' NGO dealing  with
    "gender mainstreaming in  management  and  resolution  of  conflict  in
    Africa - monitoring and assessing women and  children's  conditions  in
    African countries; Communications and public information advisor to the
    group".

89.   Her CV states that she was based at  the  UN  Headquarters  in  Geneva
    between 1995 and  2005,  that  she  reported  on  humanitarian  issues,
    development economies and Africa related  diplomacy  for  a  number  of
    organisations  that  included  BBC  News  on-line  (Africa  and   World
    Services) and  various  African  and  pan  Africa  news  agencies.   In
    particular, and notably under the heading "Journalism", she states that
    she has conducted research "into  the  position  of  refugees  and  the
    provision of humanitarian  relief  in  C�te  d'Ivoire,  Congo  and  the
    Central African  Republic  for  monthly  country  bulletins  issued  by
    Writenet /UNHCR and Writenet /UNHCR special reports  on  C�te  d'Ivoire
    and the Central African Republic".

90.    Ms Monekosso states that she remains a  regular  visitor  to  Africa
    "for meetings and other professional trips" and that she has  extensive
    knowledge  of  Africa  and  has  "regular  contact  with  friends   and
    journalist colleagues living in Africa  from  where  I  get  up-to-date
    first-hand information".

91.   Ms Monekosso describes herself as having "detailed  country  expertise
    on Sub-Sahara Africa" and that she has "developed extensive  specialist
    knowledge on social structures and traditions, the position of women in
    local issues in several regions of Africa  -  Central  Africa  and  the
    Great Lakes, West Africa and the Horn of Africa".  Further that she has
    substantial experience of detailed case-specific research  into  social
    and legal issues and the position of women in these regions.

92.   Ms Monekosso further claims that in her work  as  an  expert  witness,
    she has carried out a large  number  of  detailed  investigations  into
    issues including:

          "The customary punishment of  women  such  as  customary  adultery
         laws, national legislation related to nationality laws,  rights  of
         sexual minorities, ethnic of origin dispute and the impact of post-
         colonial borders ..."


93. Ms  Monekosso  describes  her  current  occupation  as  that  of  Office
    Director for Afromedi@net.  She describes Afromedi@net as a:

         "Leading Network Journalist and Researcher specialised  in  African
         issues.  The office Afromedi@net is based in France and working  in
         partnership with Hawksmoore  Bureau  BUK-focuses  on  investigative
         journalism and  providing  up-to-date  first-hand  information  and
         independent analysis on human rights, development and  humanitarian
         affairs in Africa".


94.    Ms  Monekosso's  language  skills  include  fluency  in  Douala,  she
    qualifies that claim by adding "Cameroonian language".

95.   Ms Monekosso produced two reports in respect of the appellant.

Ms Monekosso's first report

96.   In her first report dated 19 June 2008, she  explained  that  she  had
    last visited the Ivory Coast between 1 and 8  December  2007  when  she
    described having had "a high level political meeting with  the  country
    authorities".   She visited Abidjan and met President Gbagbo and  on  a
    visit to Bouake in the North she met the Prime Minister and the Head of
    Forces Nouvelles, Guillaume Soro.  On a visit to Yamoussoukro  she  met
    the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Communication and other members
    of the current  government  and  what  she  describes  as  "many  other
    important personalities including traditional leaders".   Ms Monekosso
    tells us that she  discussed  with  them  a  number  of  the  country's
    political matters that included economic and  humanitarian  conditions.
    Further that  she  discussed  in  private  with  a  number  of  Ivorian
    journalist colleagues who lived and worked in the Ivory Coast and  with
    other foreign press correspondents to the country,  matters  concerning
    conditions in the country and in the region.

97.   In the course of her evidence before us, it  became  clear  that  such
    meetings were largely the result of  her  having  attended  the  Annual
    Congress of the International Francophone Press Union where she was one
    of approximately 200 journalists visiting the country  for  eight  days
    with the  programme  being  focused  on  the  C�te  d'Ivoire's  current
    situation and its position in Francophone Africa.  In the course of  Ms
    Monekosso's cross-examination, it became apparent that these were  not,
    as we had first thought, face-to-face meetings with  the  President  of
    the Ivory Coast, its Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and other  senior
    government officials, but meetings that occurred as one of  this  group
    of 200 journalists.  Ms Monekosso had not  personally  spent  any  time
    alone with the President on her visit in December 2007.

98.   Ms Monekosso explained that she retained regular  contacts  with  her
    friends and journalist colleagues living in the Ivory Coast, "from whom
    I get up-to-date first-hand information".

99.   Ms Monekosso explained that her report  drew  "on  a  wide  range  of
    sources some of which may not be familiar".  The report  set  out  what
    was described as a "a brief guide to major sources" from which  it  was
    apparent that she was largely  endorsing  material  from  international
    news agencies such as Agent France Presse (AFP) and  Reuters.   Account
    was also taken of US State Department reports and what she described as
    "a range of C�te d'Ivoire  domestic  and  externally  based  electronic
    media sources reflecting diverse points of view".

100.  In that latter regard, Ms Monekosso acknowledged  that  "some  have  a
    pro or anti-government slant and must be treated with caution but  they
    provide useful insights into debates and trends and tips about  insider
    news and politics".

101. The three issues that Ms Monekosso was asked to address in  her  report
    were described by her as follows:

         "1.       Firstly,  whether  women  in  C�te   d'Ivoire   share   a
              fundamental condition of social inferiority compared  to  men
              and  whether  FGM,  marriage  and/or  domestic  violence  are
              expressions of  discrimination  against  women  in  the  C�te
              d'Ivoire.


           2.     Secondly, whether the appellant would be at real  risk  of
              persecution in Odienne for defying  the  institution  of  her
              customary marriage by giving birth to a  child  outside  that
              marriage and if so to what extent would  she  be  at  similar
              risk in the rest of C�te d'Ivoire.


           3.     Thirdly, if the appellant is not at  risk  of  persecution
              for her actions in defiance of her customary marriage in C�te
              d'Ivoire outside Odienne, I am asked  to  state  whether  the
              appellant, as a single mother, could reasonably  and  without
              due harshness live outside Odienne".


102.  As to the first issue, it was Ms Monekosso's understanding  that  only
    forty per cent of  the  female  population  of  the  Ivory  Coast  were
    literate.

103.  The practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) was common  especially
    among the rural population in the North and West.  Sixty  per  cent  of
    women had undergone FGM in the Ivory Coast.  This is the figure seen in
    the OGN but a more accurate indication of the variable incidence of FGM
    appears in paragraph 86 where as  little  as  13%  and  18%  have  been
    incised in central and central west ranging to as high as 88%  in  some
    areas.

104.   Spousal abuse occurred frequently in the Ivory Coast and as  many  as
    seventy per cent of  Ivorian  women  had  experienced  domestic  abuse.
    Nevertheless domestic violence was widely regarded as a private  family
    problem.

105.  At paragraph 12 of her  report  Ms  Monekosso  claimed  that  the  law
    prohibited sex discrimination as it did discrimination  of  all  kinds,
    but that in practice, women occupied  a  subordinate  role  in  Ivorian
    society.

106.  In rural areas women and men divided the  labour.   Government  policy
    encouraged full participation by women  in  social  economic  life  but
    there  was  considerable  informal  resistance  among   employers   who
    considered women of child-bearing age less dependable then men.   Women
    were under-represented in some professions and in the managerial sector
    as a whole.  Some women  also  encountered  difficulty  with  obtaining
    loans because they could not meet the lending criteria mandated by  the
    banks.

107. Ms Monekosso continued that in the  Ivory  Coast  the  state  organised
    religion and traditional society all played  a  part  in  creating  and
    maintaining the social inferiority of women compared to men by coercing
    female conformity with norms of customary behaviour.

108.  The State had failed in practice to protect young women  and  children
    from FGM.  It did not afford women property rights in  marriage  or  on
    dissolution of marriage.  Moreover,  the  state  discriminated  against
    women in the matter of adultery and it did  not  outlaw  marital  rape.
    This is corroborated by what we have said in paragraphs 71 to 75 above.

109.  Ms Monekosso  referred  to  what  she  described  as  "three  powerful
    customary norms" that women were expected to obey. Firstly, that  women
    should undergo FGM; secondly, that they should  get  married  and  have
    children; thirdly that women should not dishonour their communities.

110.  For Ivorian women to attain any honourable condition they  had  to  be
    married although they were only expected to marry once  and  beforehand
    they were required to be circumcised.  Adultery was a criminal  offence
    for women.  For men on the other hand  polygamy  was  respectable.   Ms
    Monekosso stated that "men are not punishable under  the  criminal  law
    for marital rape or adultery".  (For reasons which later  appear,  this
    is not accurate).

111.  Ms Monekosso considered that  these  norms  "marked  women  as  second
    class because they are coercive".  Traditional society  enforced  these
    norms and serious transgressions were punished.  Traditional  societies
    had customary powers to investigate, try  and  punish  individuals.  In
    secular matters most cases were adjudicated upon in  informal  hearings
    often convened by the village chief.

112.  Traditional society in effect sought  to  guide  women  and  reinforce
    their acceptance of living  within  community  norms  as  second  class
    citizens.

113.  There were rituals of purification as well  as  punitive  measures  to
    deter and curb  the  tendency  to  deviate  from  these  norms.   Every
    extended family or tribe evolved its distinct ethical code.

114. In the case of adultery, customary decisions might be taken that  women
    were punished by cutting their  backs  with  razors.   The  results  of
    mutilation or "scarifications" would communicate that the women was  an
    adulteress.  She was then beaten and repudiated in public.

115.  On the issue  of  FGM,  Ms  Monekosso  placed  reliance  on  what  she
    described as the preliminary results of the MICS  2006  Report.    MICS
    refers to "The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey  Programme"  developed
    by UNICEF that assists countries in filling data  gaps  for  monitoring
    the situation  of  children  and  women  through  statistically  sound,
    internationally  comparable  estimates  of  socio-economic  and  health
    indicators.

116.  Those results showed that nearly eighty seven per  cent  of  women  in
    Northern Ivory Coast had  been  the  victims  of  FGM/Cutting  (FGM/C).
    FGM/C was still practiced among most population  groups  in  the  Ivory
    Coast even though the prevalence of such was higher within some  ethnic
    groups, the Muslim population and in rural areas.

117.  Ms Monekosso referred to the UNICEF MICS  2007  analysis  that  showed
    that there was a  strong  social  consensus  around  these  mutilations
    initially done to prepare a young girl  to  womanhood.   FGM  practices
    affected an increasing number of younger girls and even babies.   These
    practices continued despite the adoption almost ten years ago of a  law
    prohibiting FGM.   In  Ms  Monekosso's  opinion,  FGM  was  an  extreme
    expression of discrimination against women in the Ivory  Coast  because
    they were forced to undergo FGM before being considered full members of
    Ivorian society. In addition, those women who refused  to  undergo  FGM
    were "socially rejected, stigmatised and ostracised".

118.  Ms Monekosso described FGM as a "gender based form of violence  and  a
    typical form of domestic violence practiced within the family".

119.  She considered that given the presence of FGM in the Ivory Coast,  the
    State had failed to protect women, particularly girls from  FGM.   This
    is clearly one of the more controversial  passages  of  Ms  Monekosso's
    evidence to which we will return later.  Whilst there is no doubt  that
    the practice is widespread, its impact is variable and we will need  to
    consider the  steps  taken  by  the  authorities  to  counter  it.   Ms
    Monekosso  pointed  out  that,  until  1998,  there  was  no  law  that
    specifically prohibited the practice which was considered illegal  only
    as a violation of general laws prohibiting crimes against persons.

120.  However, the Law Concerning Crimes against Women enacted  in  December
    1998 specifically forbade FGM and subjected those who performed  it  to
    criminal penalties, imprisonment of up to some five years and a fine of
    approximately $650 to $3,500 (360,000 to  2  million  CFA  francs)  and
    there were double penalties for medical practitioners.

121.  As regards marriage in  the  Ivory  Coast,  this  was  an  institution
    highly esteemed by Ivorian society and women especially  were  expected
    to get married and stay married.  If a woman could not get married  she
    was considered to be of low morality.

122. Unmarried women were not seen as full members of society.  They  lacked
    social status.  Unmarried women were considered blameworthy by society.
     Marriage and children conferred more value and status  on  women  than
    education which was believed to reduce a woman's prospect  of  marriage
    so in  the  Ivory  Coast  there  was  one  official  form  of  marriage
    recognised by law which was married under ordinance.

123.  According  to  the  Ivorian  Civil  Code,  only  marriages  that  were
    performed by a registry were legal. Official polygamy was  outlawed  in
    the  Ivory  Coast  although  it  continued  to  be  widely   practiced,
    particularly in Muslim communities. However in  Ivorian  society,  male
    polygamy was common and respected. Further, both customary and  Islamic
    marriages  conferred  marriage  status  on  women  even  though   those
    marriages did not prevent their husbands entering into other polygamous
    marriages.

124.  Customary or traditional marriages usually  took  place  by  agreement
    between families and were commonly confirmed by the payment of a dowry.
    Many such marriages were arranged marriages or  even  forced  marriage.
    Nearly all Ivorian marriage was customary.  Even couples contracting  a
    marriage under ordinance, performed a customary marriage first.

125.  Husbands were regarded as the head of  the  household.  Spousal  abuse
    (usually wife beating) occurred frequently and it was not  specifically
    penalised, nor  was  marital  rape.   A  woman  was  presumed  to  have
    consented to sexual intercourse by marriage even if a union was  at  an
    early age and/or forced.

126.  In relation to inheritance rights, Ms Monekosso explained that on  the
    death of a spouse, household property  was  divided  according  to  the
    Marriage Act.  A surviving  female  spouse  ranked  fifth  among  those
    eligible to inherit and she was excluded from inheritance if there were
    children because the children got this share in that case.

127.  Ms Monekosso referred to Article 391 of the  Penal  Code  that  stated
    that "adultery is not only grounds for  divorce  but  also  an  offence
    punishable by imprisonment of two months to one year.   A  woman  found
    guilty of adultery is punished along with her partner".

128.  Notably, at paragraph 48 of her  report,  Ms  Monekosso  continued  as
    follows:

      "Only the female spouse is punishable under the criminal law if  found
      guilty of adultery, together with her partner.  A male  spouse  cannot
      be punished for adultery." (Emphasis added).


129.  Ms Monekosso continued that men  were  heads  of  household  and  were
    permitted to rape and abuse their spouses with impunity.

130.  Although the law specifically penalised  anyone  who  forced  a  minor
    under 18 years of age to enter a  religious  or  customary  matrimonial
    union, twenty six per cent of 15 to 19 year old girls were  married  in
    the Ivory Coast and the state failed to protect  children  from  forced
    marriage in traditional ceremonies rather than to illegal registration.

131.  In Ms Monekosso's opinion,  whether  marriage  was  legal,  customary,
    forced  or  consensual,  it  was  the  fundamental  expression  of  the
    inferiority of women in the Ivory Coast.   It  institutionalised  their
    inferior status compared to men.

132.  Ms Monekosso explained there was no reliable statistical data  on  the
    extent of domestic violence in the Ivory Coast, though according to the
    Association Ivoirienne de  D�fense  des  Droits  de  la  Femme  (AIDF),
    seventy per cent of women in the Ivory Coast were victims  of  domestic
    violence.  This is consistent with the 2006 MICS report (from a  survey
    sample of 13,000 persons) which  indicated  that  nearly  2  out  of  3
    (roughly 60% or more) thought a husband had the right to hit his  wife.
    (But we recall, this figure was significantly  less  in  Abidjan,  44%,
    less than half, suggesting the different attitudes in urban areas.)

133.  The inferior status of women and the considerable number of  newspaper
    reports suggested that domestic violence was widespread throughout  the
    country.  Women who  complained  of  domestic  violence  were  socially
    excluded  and  suffered  tremendous  pressure  from   their   families.
    Traditional attitudes did not permit women to reject domestic violence.
     Much of this is supported by the US State Department report  to  which
    we have referred in paragraphs 72 to 73 above.

134.  Ms Monekosso considered that the prevalence of  domestic  violence  in
    the Ivory Coast was an expression of social  inferiority  because  wife
    beating which was a  criminal  offence  that  constituted  grounds  for
    divorce under civil law was common in the Ivory Coast  but  the  police
    rarely intervened in domestic disputes.

135.  Ms Monekosso continued that the  courts  and  police  viewed  domestic
    violence as a problem to be addressed within the family unless  serious
    bodily harm was inflicted or the victim lodged  a  complaint  in  which
    case criminal proceedings could be initiated.  However a  victim's  own
    parents often urged withdrawal of a complaint because of the effect  of
    social stigma on the entire family.

136.   It was  Ms  Monekosso's  opinion  that  the  prevalence  of  domestic
    violence in Ivorian society was an expression of the inferior status of
    women compared to men.

137.  On the second issue, (the risk of persecution in Odienne or  elsewhere
    for defying the institution of her customary marriage by  giving  birth
    to a child outside marriage), it was Ms Monekosso's considered  opinion
    that if the  appellant  returned  to  Odienne  she  would  face  ritual
    punishment for  adultery  and  abandoning  her  husband.    In  secular
    matters most cases were adjudicated upon  in  informal  hearings  often
    convened by the village  chief  but  that  in  any  event,  family  and
    community members might also apply disciplinary procedures even  trying
    and torturing individuals for serious  violations  of  norms,  such  as
    adultery.

138.  The vast majority of norms,  taboos  and  prohibitions  were  directed
    towards protecting the community.

139.  Every extended family or  tribe  evolved  its  distinct  ethical  code
    which it would act to preserve.  The  observance  of  tradition  was  a
    matter of  honour  and  having  a  child  born  of  adultery  could  be
    considered a crime of honour.  Furthermore, the Muslim society  in  the
    Ivory Coast would regard the appellant's actions as particularly taboo,
    offensive and humiliating.

140.  Customary laws relating to adultery  "undoubtedly  existed".   It  was
    however "uncertain" whether  the  appellant  could  be  punished  under
    Article 391 for adultery given that  she  was  not  married  under  the
    ordinance.  Nevertheless  Article  391  reinforced  the  legitimacy  of
    customary law  which  punished  women  for  adultery  rejecting  forced
    marriage, and in the appellant's case disobeying her  father  and  also
    her husband.  By customary law the appellant had  broken  the  contract
    under which she was married.  It would, in Ms Monekosso's opinion, "be
    impossible to defy these customary laws".

141.  As to the existence of risk  to  the  appellant  outside  Odienne,  Ms
    Monekosso pointed out that Muslim social and community structures  were
    highly traditional and placed great importance on marriage  and  female
    fidelity.  The appellant's particular circumstances would thus  prevent
    her from seeking the assistance of local Muslim  communities  elsewhere
    in the Ivory Coast  as  these  communities  would  seek  to  punish  or
    ostracise her.

142.  Ms Monekosso referred to the security climate in the Ivory  Coast  and
    the forthcoming national elections and was of the view that it was thus
    certain that the police would control the appellant as they would other
    ordinary citizens.  The police in the South would regard the  appellant
    with suspicion as  a  Muslim  woman  from  the  North.   She  would  be
    interrogated for information concerning Forces Nouvelles.

143.  In addition, there were credible reports that gendarmes entered  homes
    and businesses to extort money, that police detained persons  overnight
    in police stations where they beat detainees and  forced  them  to  pay
    bribes.  The police also harassed persons of northern  origin  or  with
    northern names.  (We note the latter claim was sourced from a  2006  US
    State Department Report).

Ms Monekosso's view of appellant's situation

144.  Ms Monekosso believed that during interrogation it was "certain"  that
    the appellant would be asked about her marital status as was usual  for
    young women when  confronted  by  the  security  forces.   If  she  was
    identified as a single mother and a Muslim then it was  "certain"  that
    the security forces would try to abuse her for they would be able to do
    so with impunity.  They would act in the knowledge that  the  appellant
    had nobody to intervene on her behalf.

145.  Ms Monekosso continued  that  the  appellant  would  require  official
    identity papers to access public services, develop a business  or  pass
    through checkpoints that were commonly  established  on  roads  by  the
    security forces.  Without an official identity the appellant would have
    to live as a 'non-person' deprived of  access  to  public  services  or
    formal sector employment, on the margins of society.

146.  The appellant would require identity papers  to  prove  that  she  was
    Ivorian given the proximity of national elections and the suspicion  on
    the  part  of  the  security  forces  that  the  Ivory  Coast  Northern
    neighbours would seek  to  infiltrate  the  country  to  influence  the
    election results.

147.  Ms Monekosso considered the relevance of  the  appellant's  name  that
    identified her as a Douala, a Northerner and a member of a cross-border
    ethnic group.  As such she would face discrimination from the  security
    forces and could not present herself as a member of any community.

148.  Ms Monekosso considered that it would be extremely difficult  for  the
    appellant to live in any provincial region outside  of  her  home  area
    because she would be viewed with suspicion and socially ostracised.  As
    a woman living alone without access to land  or  economic  assets,  the
    appellant would find it extremely difficult to be  accepted  and  would
    have no ready access to a basic means of livelihood and she would be at
    risk of maltreatment or sexual exploitation.  Thus the appellant  would
    be certain to suffer social exclusion and severe discrimination even in
    areas far from the North.

149.  The judiciary would not offer effective protection  to  a  lone  woman
    who had an elicit child from an adulterous  relationship  even  if  her
    marriage was traditional as opposed to a marriage under ordinance.

150.  As to the third issue, that essentially focused on whether or not  the
    appellant could safely and  internally  relocate  outside  Odienne.  Ms
    Monekosso acknowledged  that  in  Abidjan,  the  capital,  "the  social
    climate (was) more relaxed".  The appellant would  however  be  without
    any means of support in business, employment or farming.

151. Ms Monekosso considered that the appellant would face  prostitution  or
    being trafficked in West Africa.  Indeed wherever she went as a Douala,
    Ms D would "lack the privileged and  protected  social  position  which
    married women enjoy".

152.  Away from her home area, the appellant without access  to  land  would
    find herself in exceptional difficulty to survive in a rural area.  She
    would not be accepted in a rural community elsewhere in the Ivory Coast
    where discrimination was at its worst.   As  a  young  woman  from  the
    Douala community without any family links in the new area she would  be
    considered to be a foreigner.

153.  Ms Monekosso continued that the appellant's status as a single  Muslim
    mother in the Ivory Coast would leave her in an  acutely  isolated  and
    weakened position where she would face discrimination,  stigmatisation,
    ostracism and rejection.

154.  Being a Muslim and single mother was a case of dishonour in the  Ivory
    Coast and would lead to all kinds of suspicion, that the appellant  was
    "an adultery mother or a sex worker".   The  appellant  would  find  it
    exceptionally  difficult  to  live  as  an  independent  single  mother
    elsewhere in the country as the  entire  Muslim  and  Douala  community
    would consider her to be the "wife of ..." even  if  it  was  a  forced
    marriage.

155.  Further the appellant if returned to the Ivory Coast as a young  woman
    who had been to Europe was likely to be rejected  by  Ivorian  society.
    Many people would assume that she had  been  a  sex  worker.   She  was
    likely to be marginalised in society.

156.  Ms Monekosso continued that such risks would be sharply  increased  if
    it were known that the appellant committed adultery and was raising  an
    illicit child and that she had run away from a forced marriage and  had
    defied domestic violence.  The appellant's risk would be  increased  as
    she would be perceived  as  a  woman  of  low  morality  and  a  likely
    prostitute.  If the appellant sought to move elsewhere she  would  lack
    access to a source of income or land and would also  be  regarded  with
    suspicion in social terms.

157.  In addition, Ms Monekosso considered that given the  number  of  myths
    well-known in the country about  traditional  matters  and  witchcraft,
    other communities would not wish to  have  a  'Muslim  fugitive  woman'
    living in  their  community.   Not  having  acted  in  accordance  with
    tradition, the appellant would be widely perceived by any community  as
    threatening and dangerous; for other ethnic groups to harbour  such  an
    individual would be embarrassing.  This stigma and discrimination would
    seriously affect the appellant's attempts at relocation.

158.  Ms Monekosso thus concluded her report as follows:

         "The institutions in C�te d'Ivoire who should in theory protect  an
         individual such as Ms D are in fact  completely  ineffective.   The
         judiciary is highly corrupt; the police and army are  characterised
         by frequent resorts to brutality and show no concern for protecting
         women against harsh traditional social practices, regardless of the
         letter of the law that bans domestic violence".


Ms Monekosso's second report


159.  In her second report dated 8 October 2008  Ms  Monekosso  set  out  in
    French and also in translation the provisions of  Article  391  of  the
    Ivory Coast's  Penal  Code.   It  will  be  as  well  to  set  out  the
    translation:

         "Adultery is not only grounds for  divorce,  but  also  an  offence
         punishable by imprisonment of two months  to  one  year.   A  woman
         found guilty of adultery is punished along with her  partner.   For
         her husband's adultery to be  punishable,  however,  he  must  have
         committed the act in the marital home or have had an ongoing sexual
         relationship with a woman other than his wife outside  the  marital
         home.  The man's partner is not punished.  Divorce proceedings  may
         be averted  or  halted  by  the  offending  spouse's  collusion  or
         forgiveness."


160.  Ms Monekosso continued that she now recognised that it was:

         "Immediately apparent that paragraph 48 of my original  report  was
         mistaken in suggesting that the penal code did not  criminalise  or
         punish male spouses for adultery."


161.  Ms Monekosso continued that:

         "Plainly, a male spouse may be criminally liable for  adultery  but
         in more limited circumstances than female spouses.  A female spouse
         is exposed to criminal liability for any act of adultery, whereas a
         male spouse is only liable for an adulterous  act  in  the  marital
         home or for a series of adulterous acts with a woman.


      It would seem that a male spouse is not  punishable  under  the  penal
      code for single acts of adultery with different women outside  of  the
      marital home".


162.  Ms Monekosso's report continued by reference to  information  she  had
    received from Fatimata Diabate who was described as:

         "The Training Officer of the Association of Women  Jurists  of  the
         Ivory Coast, who was admitted to the Bar of Abidjan in  [date]  and
         who practices as an advocate, that in practice it is very much more
         difficult for a woman to bring a charge  of  adultery  against  her
         spouse than it is for a man to do so against his spouse. Ms Diabate
         is from the Northern Ivory Coast as is the appellant". (The  square
         bracket reference  is  Ms  Monekosso's  who  did  not  subsequently
         provide us with any information as to  the  date  of  Ms  Diabate's
         admission to the Abidjan Bar).


163.  Ms Monekosso summarised the information that she had gleaned  from  Ms
    Diabate. Indeed, many of the paragraphs that follow begin or  end  with
    the expression "Ms Diabate advised that ..."

164.  Ms Monekosso was told by Ms Diabate, that before a male  spouse  could
    be prosecuted for adultery,  consent  was  required  from  two  sources
    firstly the Procureur de  le  Republique  and  secondly  from  a  court
    bailiff.  There were no  restrictions  governing  the  commencement  of
    criminal  proceedings  against  women  for   adultery.    In   practice
    therefore, Ms Diabate advised that only female spouses were  punishable
    under Article 391.  Ms Diabate had however, further advised that there
    were no reported cases in the Ivory Coast concerning the prosecution of
    female spouses under Article 391.  That was not to say  there  had  not
    been any prosecutions, but the court archive could  only  be  consulted
    with the permission of the Procureur de le  Republique  and  then  only
    after a legal process to determine whether  access  was  necessary  and
    relevant to the needs of the country.

165.  Ms Diabate advised that it was much more common for  husbands  to  use
    traditional or informal institutions to punish their female spouses for
    adultery.

166.  Ms Diabate advised that  a  woman  such  as  the  appellant  would  be
    publicly shamed and blamed.  The appellant would be  required  to  take
    the Calabash  and  make  several  tours  of  the  village  roads.   The
    appellant would be forced  to  confess  her  adultery  in  the  various
    compounds that housed the community and  beg  for  forgiveness.   Local
    community leaders would question the appellant in front of her husband.
     The appellant's husband would have the choice of pardoning, punishing,
    tolerating or repudiating  his  wife.   Punishments  could  range  from
    forced servitude on the husband's land for both the appellant  and  her
    child, beatings followed by repudiation,  ritualistic  cutting  of  the
    appellant's back to leave scars indicating that she was an  adulteress,
    ostracism or even honour killings.

167.  Ostracism was a particularly devastating form of  punishment  in  that
    the appellant would no longer be allowed  to  share  the  life  of  her
    community. So severe was the punishment of ostracism, that every member
    of the community would dread it and do everything possible to avoid it.
     It deprived one of access to land and any means of livelihood.

168.  Notably, Ms Monekosso conceded that she had no personal  knowledge  of
    the rituals or punishments observed by the Muslim community in Odienne.
    Every extended family or tribe would  have  evolved  its  own  distinct
    ethical  code.   Ms  Monekosso  sourced  that  information   from   the
    following: "Crime and African Traditional Religion", S A Adewale.

169.  Ms Monekosso concluded her second report  by  repeating  that  it  was
    unrealistic to expect a lone Muslim woman  with  a  child  to  live  an
    independent life which would not be unduly harsh  in  the  Ivory  Coast
    pointing out that:

         "Apart from or outside a traditional family or community network of
         support  such  a  life  would  be  below  the  minimum  level   for
         subsistence, alternatively, the  appellant  would  be  forced  into
         prostitution and trafficking".




Ms Monekosso's Oral Evidence and evaluation


170.  In addition to her written reports, we have  had  the  opportunity  of
    listening to and evaluating Ms Monekosso's lengthy oral evidence before
    us over a period of two days.  Although  we  do  not  underestimate  or
    undervalue  the  expressed  opinion  of  someone   whose   professional
    experience and knowledge of related humanitarian affairs in Africa  has
    extended over more than twenty years, we  have  nevertheless  concluded
    that her evidence falls to be treated with caution.   Our  reasons  for
    so finding are as follows.

171.  At an early stage in her  oral  evidence  we  asked  Ms  Monekosso  to
    explain to us why there was no report directly from  Ms  Diabate.   Her
    response was as follows:

         "Women do not want to be named publicly.  I did not ask Ms  Diabate
         for a statement I  told  her  I  was  preparing  the  report  as  a
         journalist not that I was preparing a report for the court.  In  my
         experience I have learned every time I have  asked  questions  from
         people, if I say it is for a court to be publicised they would be a
         little afraid.  I told her that I  was  not  going  to  name  her."
         (Emphasis added)


172.  When it was drawn to  Ms  Monekosso's  attention,  that  her  evidence
    (insofar as it related to the Ivory Coast's Civil Code  Procedures  and
    particularly Article 391 of the Penal Code) appeared to us to be second-
    hand, her candid response was as follows:

      "The only evidence I have in this matter is what  I  was  told  by  Ms
      Diabate". (Emphasis added)


173.  When asked as to whether Ms Diabate had provided details of the  proof
    required in terms of establishing the fact of  adultery,  Ms  Monekosso
    responded that she did receive an explanation from Ms Diabate:

      "But I do not think I mention that in my report because that  was  not
      asked of me and I did not want to give more  information  than  I  was
      asked - but there are several forms of proof according to  the  ethnic
      groups".


174.  When asked if she had undertaken any research  studies  in  the  Ivory
    Coast her response was evasive in her stating:

         "It depends on what you mean.  I am an investigator."


175.  On being further pressed, Ms Monekosso explained that she worked  with
    a colleague who conducted research for the UNHCR under the auspices  of
    Writenet which was in fact an UNHCR bulletin.  Ms Monekosso had  worked
    "most for the confidential press and the public press".

176.  Whilst we are mindful that an expert can be  perfectly  well-qualified
    to speak about the territory without herself having been there (see for
    example, K [2005] EWCA Civ 1627) we have concluded upon a consideration
    of Ms Monekosso's evidence, oral and documentary,  that  her  expertise
    has significant limitations in the sense that she  has  a  wide-ranging
    interest in Pan African/ethnic affairs as a  journalist,  with  a  very
    keen interest in African issues.  She last visited the Ivory Coast  for
    one week with a  group  of  some  200  journalists  in  December  2007.
    However, it became apparent to us in the course of her  oral  evidence,
    that her direct knowledge of matters relating to the Ivory Coast was in
    fact limited.

177.  Much of her evidence in relation to the Ivory Coast was  derived  from
    what she was told by Ms Diabate in the course of a telephone  interview
    that Ms Monekosso admitted had been conducted in circumstances where Ms
    Diabate had been misled as to its purpose.  Ms  Monekosso  on  her  own
    admission misled Ms Diabate when assuring her that any information that
    she gave would not be  the  subject  of  a  report  or  for  a  Court's
    evaluation.  She also said that she would maintain the  confidentiality
    of her source.

178.  Although much of Ms Monekosso's report is  clearly  derived  from  the
    same sources as we have set out above, we are concerned  about  certain
    aspects  of  the  report  and,  in  particular,  her   evidence   about
    punishments meted out in traditional communities upon those accused  of
    adultery. Mr Bedford both before us and in his skeleton  argument  (see
    for example paragraph 54 of his skeleton) was clear that  Ms Monekosso
    was:

         "... the principal source of the evidence that female  adultery  is
         severely punished by traditional society for which she  is  reliant
         on Ms Diabate, Training Officer of the Association of Women Jurists
         in the Ivory Coast and Barrister  in  Abidjan:  Monekosso's  report
         Oct. 2008 paras 11 to 15".


179.  Ms Monekosso gave evidence that Ms Diabate had  given  her  permission
    to mention her name and she admitted that Ms Diabate was  unaware  that
    it was for court proceedings.  When  asked  to  explain,  Ms  Monekosso
    responded:

         "I think I need to go back to my recollection.   Generally I say to
         people they won't be quoted just to reassure  them.   That  is  the
         best way to preserve my contact for me to be able to approach  them
         in the future without any problem - but as a journalist I  am  free
         to mention them - it is up to me  to  deal  with  it  ...   In  our
         profession we are free to quote or not quote someone".


180. When asked if it was so, even  if  it  meant  breaking  a  promise,  Ms
    Monekosso responded:

         "Yes - even if it would cause a scandal - we have the right and  in
         some instances when we are asked  to  reveal  our  sources  we  can
         refuse ... that is how we work in general - apart from  the  formal
         interviewing most of the time we just have an  informal  discussion
         rather than a formal interview". (Emphasis added).


181.  It was put to Ms  Monekosso  that  her  answers  meant  that  she  was
    prepared to mislead an interviewee in the cause of  journalism  on  the
    basis that  the  means  justified  the  ends.   To  this  Ms  Monekosso
    responded that it was:

         "... a working technique an investigative technique and we  get  in
         step by step to obtain the most credible information".


182.  Ms Monekosso continued that she recalled telephoning  Ms  Diabate  and
    informing her that she was a journalist gathering  information  on  the
    Ivory Coast but that:

         "I didn't mention at any time court proceedings.  As  a  journalist
         and woman I must have mentioned to her that  I  was  interested  in
         women's' rights in the Ivory Coast.  I asked  the  questions  about
         adultery and I said  to  her  that  I  wanted  to  find  out  about
         traditional practices since it was not written law - and  she  gave
         me all the details on what she knew so I did not mention the  court
         or any hearings".


183.  When asked in what context Ms Monekosso informed Ms Diabate  that  her
    name would not be mentioned, Ms Monekosso responded in general terms as
    follows:

         "I told her not to worry.  Once  I  have  introduced  myself  as  a
         journalist I say 'Listen I just want some  information  -  I  won't
         mention your name anywhere - it's not a formal interview'. This  is
         to put people at ease. Then they would not have to  ask  me  'Would
         you publish my name?'."


184.  Ms Monekosso continued:

         "It was better that she should feel I  was  writing  for  a  female
         magazine".

185.  In our judgment, Ms Monekosso's approach was not only  misleading  and
    regrettable but  also  prejudiced  the  integrity  of  the  information
    provided.  She should have appreciated that  an  interviewee  would  be
    likely to speak in different terms if told that what she had to say was
    for the purposes of a court report as distinct from  information  given
    in the course of a casual discussion about her work with  a  friend  or
    acquaintance.

186.  Formal interviews attributable to an official speaking  on  behalf  of
    an organisation for whom she works with the knowledge that the material
    will be used for the purposes of a Tribunal's proceedings are likely to
    provide  different  information  from  an  off-the  cuff,  unattributed
    expression of opinion.  Far from providing more  reliable  information,
    (as Ms Monekosso appears to have thought), we would have thought it  is
    likely to be less reliable; all the more so, if it is the  sole  source
    for that information.

187.  At paragraph 18 of her first report, Ms Monekosso told us that:

         "Men are not punishable under the criminal law for marital rape  or
         adultery".


188.  In the same vein at paragraph 48 of her report Ms Monekosso stated:

         "Men are permitted to rape and abuse their spouses with impunity".


189.  By the time of her second report, Ms Monekosso acknowledged  that  she
    was mistaken in suggesting that the penal code did not  criminalise  or
    punish male spouses for adultery and that:

         "Plainly a male spouse may be criminally liable for adultery ...".


190.  At paragraph 7 of her first report, Ms Monekosso quoted from a  source
    that asserted that:

         "In secular matters, most cases are adjudicated  upon  in  informal
         hearings, often convened by the village  chief  but  in  any  event
         family  and  community  members   may   also   apply   disciplinary
         procedures, even  trying  and  torturing  individuals  for  serious
         violations of norms, such as adultery".


191.  In fact, the document from which Ms Monekosso was quoting, related  to
    Uganda and as Ms  Kiss  rightly  noted,  Ms  Monekosso  has  not  since
    submitted alternative written background  evidence  demonstrating  such
    practices in the Ivory Coast.

192.  This was not the only occasion in the course of Ms  Monekosso's  first
    report where her evidence as  to  the  position  of  women  in  Ivorian
    society was sourced from material relating to a different country.   At
    paragraph 20 of her first report, Ms Monekosso had stated as follows:

           "Traditional  society  in  effect  seeks  to  guide  women   and
           reinforce their acceptance of living within community  norms  as
           second  class  citizens.    There   are   equally   rituals   of
           purification, as well as punitive measures to deter and curb the
           tendency to deviate from these norms.  Every extended family  or
           tribe evolves its distinct ethical code."


193.  That contention was sourced as a  footnote  to  her  report  from  the
    following: "Crime and African Traditional Religion", S.A. Adewale.

194.  When cross-examined, Ms Monekosso was informed by Ms  Kiss,  that  she
    had obtained a copy of Mr Adewale's report from which it was clear that
    it did not relate to the Ivory Coast but  to  Nigeria.   There  was  no
    mention of the Ivory Coast in the document.  Ms Monekosso was therefore
    asked on what basis (given that she again referred to the  same  report
    at paragraph 11 of her second report) she relied  on  it  as  being  of
    probative effect in relation to conditions in the Ivory Coast.

195.  Ms Monekosso's response largely  evaded  the  issue.   She  sought  to
    explain that she worked:

         "... on different ethnic groups  across  Africa  and  these  ethnic
         groups  often  have  the  same  traditions   but   with   different
         approaches".


196.  There may or may not be traditions which  cross  national  borders  or
    ethnic groupings.  In some cases, therefore,  it  may  be  possible  to
    derive support from information from other countries.  Where,  however,
    this is relied upon, we  would  expect  to  see  the  source  carefully
    explained and suitable consideration given as to whether a  correlation
    is established.

197.  Ms Monekosso continued  that  insofar  as  Mr  Adewale's  report  was
    concerned he talked about adultery and that:


         "... even if it is not the same practice in the Ivory  Coast  -  in
         the Ivory Coast itself the practice is different but the logics  of
         punishment are more or less the same".


198.  When asked why she had not made these matters clear in her report,  Ms
    Monekosso stated that she worked:

         "... on traditional questions.  My  aim  is  towards  the  'ethnic'
         rather than the 'country'."


199.  Ms Monekosso was aware that Mr Adewale was Nigerian  and  provided  no
    satisfactory explanation as to  how  a  traditional  paper  on  African
    Traditional Religion had direct relevance to the  appellant  who  comes
    from a Muslim background.

200. Although in paragraph 11 of her second report, Ms Monekosso  said  that
    she had "no personal knowledge of the rituals or  punishments  observed
    by the Muslim community in Odienne" she had then referred to an extract
    from Mr Adewale's report.  When asked to explain how, at paragraph  14,
    she could thus state that the appellant would suffer "beatings followed
    by repudiation, ritualistic cutting of the appellant's  back  to  leave
    scars, indicating that she is an adulteress, ostracism or  even  honour
    killing", she failed to provide an adequate response and accepted  that
    she had no specific evidence  that  the  Muslim  community  in  Odienne
    practised beatings and the treatment that she had  earlier  identified.
    She had relied on the information given to her by Miss Diabate although
    she again accepted that Ms Diabate's  information  was  based  "on  the
    people of  the  North  without  being  specific  about  the  people  in
    Odienne".

201.  Ms Monekosso came from Cameroon.  We had seen  references  to  Nigeria
    and Uganda.  What Ms Monekosso appeared to  be  talking  about  was  in
    global terms over all the continents of West Africa and  was  thus  not
    limited to the Francophone areas.  We  were  not  persuaded  that  such
    parallels might properly be drawn, at least without a suitable level of
    caution, not expressed in her report.


202.  Ms Monekosso also told us about the existence  of  "secret  societies"
    in the Ivory Coast of which we observed there was no mention in  either
    of her reports.  Her explanation for its omission  was  unsatisfactory,
    saying that it was implied although not expressly stated.  We were  not
    told where the implication is said to have arisen.

203.  In oral evidence, Ms Monekosso accepted that her reports  contained  a
    number of errors and in that regard we are mindful of the  observations
    of the Tribunal at paragraph 58 of SD Lebanon [2008] UKAIT 00078:

         "The fact that an expert has included a quote attributing it  to  a
         report which does not in fact include that quote, raises  questions
         about the accuracy of the expert's report  in  other  respects  ...
         Experts ... can make mistakes.  On the other hand we cannot dismiss
         this error out of hand as  a  trifling  matter  either,  given  the
         Tribunal is entitled to expect the material quoted in  an  expert's
         report is actually taken from the  document  indicated  to  be  the
         source of the  quote  and  that  sources  for  any  quotations  are
         adequately indicated."


204.  We have found that Ms Monekosso's errors, as Ms Kiss  aptly  described
    them, went "beyond the mere typographical".

205.  On 20 June 2008, Senior Immigration Judge Gill  adjourned  the  appeal
    to give the Home Office time to consider additional evidence lodged  by
    the  appellant.   SIJ  Gill  issued  specific  directions   and   asked
    Ms Monekosso to produce her background source.  Ms Monekosso's  report
    dated 19 June 2008 did not comply with that observation.

206.  It was Ms Kiss who managed  to  ascertain  that  the  source  for  the
    material referred  to  in  paragraph  190  (disciplinary  action,  even
    amounting to torture, taken by local chiefs for  adultery)  related  to
    Uganda to which we have above referred in paragraph 192.

207.  Further in her second report, having stated no personal  knowledge  of
    the Douala, Ms Monekosso then relied on the report of Mr Adewale which
    was sourced from an article that was predominantly a polemic about  the
    Yoruba in Nigeria.

208.  It is against this background  that  we  assess  the  evidence  of  Ms
    Monekosso insofar as it relates to risk on return.  Ms Monekosso  is  a
    journalist  who  uses  investigative  techniques  in  order   to   seek
    information.  When asked if she had published any recent  papers  since
    she left university, Ms Monekosso explained that  her  techniques  were
    simply investigative, describing herself as an investigator.  There  is
    something of the campaigner in her, seeking to  advance  the  cause  of
    women in Africa for which she must be applauded but in  our  view  this
    has led to the loss, in part, of a rigorously objective approach.

209.   We  find  it  difficult  to  follow  the  logic  of  Ms   Monekosso's
    uncertainty as to whether the appellant could be punished under Article
    391 for adultery given that she was not married under  ordinance.    If
    the appellant had entered into  a  customary  marriage,  there  was  no
    reasonable  prospect  of  her  being  prosecuted.   That  Ms  Monekosso
    maintained that the risk was "uncertain" and  expressed  reluctance  to
    change her position, does not properly  reflect  the  evidence  as  the
    Record of Proceedings reveals. Ms Monekosso acknowledged at paragraph 9
    of her second report, that there  were  no  reported  cases  of  female
    spouses being prosecuted for adultery under Article 391.

210.  Having finally accepted that the appellant would not be prosecuted  by
    the law, she then insisted that the appellant would face punishment  by
    traditional methods in her home town. She "did not think the law  would
    consider her legally married..." and accepted that the appellant  would
    "not be prosecuted by the law - but by traditional methods in her  home
    town".

211.  In that regard we would  refer  to  the  following  extract  from  our
    record:

         "Ms Kiss:     You say family and community members may  also  apply
              disciplinary procedures?


         Ms Monekosso: I made a mistake.


         Q. I have obtained the documents in  relation  to  which  you  have
              sourced that claim (Ssenyonjo International  Law  Policy  the
              Family 2007).  It seems you have not added that  it  actually
              relates to Uganda why didn't you mention it?


         Ms Monekosso: I think I made a very big mistake maybe I  was  doing
                          some research.


         Chairman:            Why did you  not  bring  this  matter  to  our
                      attention of your own volition?


         Ms Monekosso:  It was only this morning when I saw this document  -
                          no one asked
                                       me to bring it to your attention.


         Ms Kiss:      This is a document upon which you rely -  surely  you
              cannot say                     you didn't know all  that  was
              in the document till this morning?


         A.       The contents of that document had nothing to do with  what
              I wrote in  that  paragraph.   This  document  talks  of  the
              Constitution in relation to Uganda and the rights of women, I
              am talking about traditional punishment - I am so sorry.


         Ms Kiss: How can you say what you said in paragraph 57  and  source
                       it to an unsound  document  which  is  talking  about
                       another country to that which you are referring to in
                       this report?


         Ms Monekosso:    I made a mistake." (Emphasis added)


212.  We turn now to what appears to  have  been  Ms  Monekosso's  essential
    source of information on  the  Douala,  namely  that  gleaned  from  Ms
    Diabate.  For the reasons we have given, the weight that we  attach  to
    this information is limited.  Ms Diabate is the Training Officer of the
    Association of Women Jurists of the Ivory Coast, a practising  advocate
    of uncertain experience.  This does not assist  us  in  evaluating  her
    evidence.

213.  Having obtained the evidence of Ms  Diabate,  Ms  Monekosso  does  not
    appear to have attempted to verify it through any independent  sources.
     When referred to the US State Department Reports, in which there  were
    no known incidents of resorts to physical  punishment,  Ms  Monekosso's
    attitude was somewhat dismissive.

214.  She admitted that she was mistaken in  relation  to  earlier  evidence
    that women in the Ivory Coast did not have property rights.

215.  Ms Monekosso continued that there was:

         "... something I noticed in the Civil Code.  Ms D's  husband's  age
         is very significant indeed. In 2003 he was 70 meaning today 75  and
         if one considers the birth certification in the olden days he could
         be 80 but the 1964 Law which abolished polygamy and  brought  about
         civil marriage, did not abolish the existing polygamous marriage or
         the customary marriage".


216.  At this point in her evidence, Ms  Monekosso  was  reminded  that  the
    appellant's marriage took place in 2004/2005 and therefore the Marriage
    Act of 1964 would not have permitted a polygamous marriage  that  post-
    dated it.

217. We are thus reinforced in our view that Ms Monekosso's evidence  should
    be approached with care and we are  not  persuaded  (unless  the  legal
    provisions  permitting  it  were  strictly  proved)  that  a   marriage
    celebrated after 1964 might be a lawful polygamous  marriage,  even  if
    the first marriage had been conducted before 1964."
