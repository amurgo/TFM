     i) Where a family permit has been  issued  by  an  ECO  after  inquiry
        pursuant to regulation 12 of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
        Area) Regulations 2006 and is used to enter the  United  Kingdom  a
        subsequent application for a residence card  is  to  be  determined
        under regulation 7(3) of the Regulations.
    ii) Where the validity of  the  issue  of  the  family  permit  is  not
        contested by the Secretary of State and the  permit  has  not  been
        revoked, the issue is whether there has been a material  change  of
        circumstances since arrival with the consequence that the  claimant
        no longer qualifies as an extended family member
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.    Mr Ewolu is a Nigerian citizen born September 1993 and therefore 18
      at the time of the hearing before us. He appeals against a decision of
      the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hanes) given on 16 June 2011 dismissing
      his appeal from a refusal of the respondent to issue him with  an  EEA
      residence card.


   2.    The material facts are as follows.  Babatunde Francis Olowu born in
      Nigeria in July 1964 is the appellant's uncle and the younger  brother
      of his mother, Abosede Ewolo.  Mr Olowu is  the  appellant's  sponsor.
      He left Nigeria in 1990 to work in Germany and subsequently  became  a
      citizen of that country.  Since 2006 he has been living and working in
      the United Kingdom.

   3.    In 2009 the appellant applied to the Entry Clearance Officer, Lagos
      for a family permit to join his uncle  in  the  United  Kingdom.  That
      application was refused on a  number  of  grounds  including  lack  of
      satisfaction  as  to  the  relationship,  insufficient   evidence   of
      dependency and doubts as to the ability of the sponsor to support  the
      appellant because there was evidence that he  supported  a  number  of
      other people for immigration entry in the past. An appeal against that
      decision was dismissed in April 2010 when the sponsor both represented
      the appellant and gave evidence.  The judge was informed by Mr.  Olowu
      that the appellant's mother had died recently.

   4.    A further application was made to  the  ECO,  Lagos  for  a  family
      permit. This was granted in September 2010 and  was  valid  for  entry
      before 15 March 2011. Neither we nor the First-tier judge were shown a
      copy of the application form or the documents submitted in support  of
      it but from the documents made available at the appeal  it  is  likely
      that  they  included  a  copy  of  the  appellant's   mother's   death
      certificate of 19 January 2010; remittance slips from the  sponsor  to
      Nigeria for the purpose of paying for  the  appellant's  education  at
      Lagooz College Lagos between 20 September 2005 and  July  2009  (total
      sum of 333,600 naira or approximately �1,313); further remittances  of
      332,500  naira  (or  approximately   �1,309)   for   the   appellant's
      attendance on a computer course  and  other  material  supporting  the
      claim. The sponsor attended for interview at the High Commission.  The
      case advanced was that the appellant's mother's  marriage  had  broken
      down some years before her death and the appellant's  father  did  not
      support his son but the sponsor did.

   5.   Equipped with the family permit, the appellant  entered  the  United
      Kingdom on 5 October 2010  and  on  25  October  2010  applied  for  a
      residence card. This application was refused on  1  March  2011.   The
      grounds for refusal included the claim that there had been  a  failure
      to provide sufficient evidence to establish that  the  sponsor  was  a
      qualified person within  the  meaning  of  the  Immigration  (European
      Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI  2006/1003)  ("the  Regulations");
      there had been no evidence of pre-entry support of the appellant;  and
      there had been no evidence of post-entry residence with or  dependence
      on the sponsor.

   6.    The appellant appealed this decision.  Judge  Hanes  was  satisfied
      that:

           i) the appellant and the sponsor were related as claimed;
          ii) the sponsor was an EEA national exercising Treaty rights as a
              worker;
         iii) the appellant had been living with the sponsor in his home
              since October 2010;
          iv) there was evidence that the sponsor had paid the appellant's
              school fees from 2005 to 2009.


      The judge nevertheless dismissed the appeal because she was not
    satisfied that:-


           i) the appellant was either a member of the sponsor's household
              prior to admission to the United Kingdom; or
          ii) the appellant had been the dependant of the sponsor before
              entry. In this context he noted that there was no information
              as to his mother's earnings in Nigeria before she died, or
              from the appellant's brother aged 23.


   7.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on 3 November
      2011.   The  grounds  of  appeal  included  the  submission  that  the
      respondent and the judge had misapplied the  Regulations  in  reaching
      their decisions and neither had given any consideration  to  the  fact
      that the ECO had already granted a family permit in Nigeria.


   8.    We heard submissions on 3 July 2012 limited to this point.  At  the
      conclusion of the hearing we indicated that we were satisfied that the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal included a material error of  law.
      We would set aside the decision and re-make it by allowing the appeal.
      We now give our written reasons for that conclusion.

The Regulations

   9.  Regulation 12 of the Regulations provides as follows:


       12.-(1) An entry clearance officer must issue an EEA family  permit
       to a person who applies for one if the person is a family member  of
       an EEA national and-

             (a) the EEA national-

             (i)  is  residing  in  the  UK  in   accordance   with   these
         Regulations; or

             (ii) will be travelling  to  the  United  Kingdom  within  six
             months of the date of the  application  and  will  be  an  EEA
             national residing in the United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with
             these Regulations on arrival in the United Kingdom; and

             (b) the family member will be accompanying the EEA national to
             the United Kingdom or joining him there and-

             (i) is lawfully resident in an EEA State; or

             (ii) would meet the  requirements  in  the  immigration  rules
             (other than those relating to entry clearance)  for  leave  to
             enter the United Kingdom as  the  family  member  of  the  EEA
             national or, in the case of direct  descendants  or  dependent
             direct relatives in the ascending line of his  spouse  or  his
             civil partner, as the family member of his spouse or his civil
             partner, were the EEA national or the spouse or civil  partner
             a person present and settled in the United Kingdom.[1]

         (2) An entry clearance officer may issue an EEA family permit to an
         extended family member of an EEA national who applies for one if-

              (a)    the relevant EEA national satisfies the  condition  in
         paragraph (1)(a);

               (b)     the extended family member wishes to  accompany  the
             relevant EEA national to the United  Kingdom or  to  join  him
             there; and

              (c)     in all the circumstances,  it  appears  to  the  entry
             clearance officer appropriate to issue the EEA family  permit.



         (3) Where an entry clearance officer receives an application under
         paragraph (2) he shall undertake an extensive  examination  of  the
         personal circumstances of the  applicant  and  if  he  refuses  the
         application shall give reasons justifying the refusal  unless  this
         is contrary to the interests of national security.

         (4) An EEA family permit issued under  this  regulation  shall  be
         issued free of charge and as soon as possible.

         (5) But an EEA family  permit  shall  not  be  issued  under  this
         regulation if the applicant or the EEA national concerned falls  to
         be excluded from the United Kingdom on grounds  of  public  policy,
         public security or public health in accordance with regulation 21.



  10.  The meaning of  the  term   "extended  family  member"  is  given  in
      regulation 8 in the following terms:


         8.-(1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a person
         who is not a family member of  an  EEA  national  under  regulation
         7(1)(a), (b) or (c) and who satisfies the conditions  in  paragraph
         (2), (3), (4) or (5).

         (2) A person satisfies the condition  in  this  paragraph  if  the
         person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse  or  his  civil
         partner and-

             (a)  the person is residing in a country other than the United
             Kingdom  in  which  the  EEA  national  also  resides  and  is
             dependent upon  the  EEA  national  or  is  a  member  of  his
             household;

             (b)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a)  and
             is accompanying the EEA national  to  the  United  Kingdom  or
             wishes to join him there; or

             (c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a),  has
             joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to
             be dependent upon him or to be a member of his household.



  11.  The Regulations seek to implement EP and Council Directive 2004/38 EC
      ("the Citizens Directive").  The Upper Tribunal's   decisions  in   RK
      (OFM- membership of household-dependency) India [2010] 421 UKUT (IAC);
       MR and others (EEA -   extended  family  members)  Bangladesh  [2010]
      UKUT 449 (IAC) and  Moneke  (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 341 (IAC)
      explained why it did not consider the requirement of  the  Regulations
      that an extended family member (or other family member  (OFM)  to  use
      the language of the Directive) must  reside  in  another  EEA  country
      other than the United Kingdom with the sponsor  before  admission  was
      compatible with the Citizens Directive. In Moneke the Tribunal decided
      that pending clarification of the law in the reference to the Court of
      Justice we made (now Case  C-83/11  SSHD  v  Rahman)  Tribunal  judges
      determining extended family member cases should consider whether there
      has been either dependency or membership of the household before entry
      to the United Kingdom,  without  dismissing  the  application  on  the
      basis of a requirement to have resided in another  EEA  country  other
      than the United Kingdom where the sponsor was also residing.


  12.  We are aware that this aspect of our  construction  of  the  Citizens
      Directive is supported by the opinion of Advocate General Bot in  Case
      C-83/11 SSHD v Rahman given on 27 March 2012; it remains  to  be  seen
      whether the Court of Justice will adopt a similar approach. We further
      note that neither the ECO in September 2010 nor the  judge  considered
      it was necessary for this appellant to have  resided  in  another  EEA
      country where his sponsor was residing  before  entry  to  the  United
      Kingdom. Plainly he has never done so. It has not been suggested by Ms
      Gough that we should apply this requirement and we have not done so.

  13. In the light of the above, the question for the ECO when the appellant
      made his second family permit application was to decide whether he was
      satisfied that:

           i) the sponsor was a qualified person and if so,
          ii) whether the appellant was dependent on the sponsor within the
              meaning of EEA law,  and if so,
         iii)  whether  following  "extensive  examination"  in   all   the
              circumstances of the case the issue of  the  permit  appeared
              appropriate.


  14.  In  this  case  the  ECO  would  have  been  aware  of  the  previous
      application made to the same  post  and  the  decision  on  the  first
      appeal. Despite the present absence of information as to the  material
      that was before him when he made the decision, it is apparent that  he
      must  have  been  satisfied  of  each  requirement  and  accepted  the
      explanations that had given rise to previous concerns. The  ECO  would
      have been aware that dependency can  be  established  by  evidence  of
      material support for essential living  needs  of  the  claimant;  that
      support does not have to be either exclusive or necessary in the sense
      that there was no one else to provide it (see Moneke at [41] to [42]).


  15.  Where a claimant enters the United Kingdom with the benefit of a pre-
      entry family permit, regulation 7(3) applies. Its terms provide:

         "Subject to paragraph (4), a  person  who  is  an  extended  family
         member and has been issued with an EEA family permit...... shall be
         treated as the family member of the relevant EEA  national  for  as
         long as he continues to satisfy the conditions in  regulation  8(2)
         ....in relation to that  EEA  national  and  the  permit...has  not
         ceased to be valid or been revoked".

  16.  We explored the  meaning  of  this  regulation  with  Ms  Gough.  She
      recognised that the regulation  meant  that  the  claimant  should  be
      treated as a family member where: the permit was properly  issued  and
      used during the period of its validity; there had been  no  revocation
      of the permit and following entry the claimant  continued  to  satisfy
      the conditions in regulation 8(2). We agree and note this chimes  with
      the terms of regulation 17(4) and (5) of the  Regulations  that  apply
      where the claimant applies for the first time in country. Where  there
      is no prior family permit the Secretary of State will have to  conduct
      the extensive examination on a first application for recognition of  a
      right of residence made after entry and where a person does  not  fall
      within regulation 7(3).


  17. Ms Gough also informed us  that  her  brief  researches  on  the  UKBA
      computer prior to the hearing revealed that the permit  had  not  been
      revoked nor was there any concern as to its validity when issued.


   Conclusions


  18. In those circumstances the task for the respondent on the  application
      for the residence card and  for  the  judge  on  appeal  was  somewhat
      narrower than the task that was in fact  undertaken.  It  is  for  the
      respondent to raise and substantiate a ground that the permit was  not
      validly or properly issued and/or should be revoked (see  Samsam  (EEA
      revocation and retained rights) Syria [2011] UKUT 165 (IAC) at [24] to
      [29]). She did not do so below and does not seek to do so before us.

  19.  In the absence of any reason to believe that the  family  permit  was
      not validly issued, or had been revoked, the  judge  in  such  a  case
      should focus on whether the claimant continued to meet the requirement
      of regulation 8(2). In this case it is apparent that the  judge  found
      that the appellant had become a member of his sponsor's  household  in
      the UK and that would be  a  sufficient  basis  to  conclude  that  he
      continued to be an extended family member although we understand  that
      he is also dependent on his sponsor while the appellant is waiting  to
      regularise his position and continue his studies. Equally there was an
      express finding that the sponsor continued to be  a  qualified  person
      through his remunerative employment in the United Kingdom.

  20.  In our judgment, there was no  occasion  to  re-visit  the  issue  of
      historic dependency before admission to the United  Kingdom  on  which
      the ECO must have been satisfied when he issued the permit. The  judge
      erred in law in re-examining the pre- entry eligibility for the permit
      on which the ECO was satisfied. Where the  permit  has  been  properly
      issued, has not been revoked and has been used to  travel  during  the
      period of its validity, then the issue of a residence  card  turns  on
      whether the  holder  of  the  family  permit  continues  to  meet  the
      requirements for being  an  extended  family  member  of  a  qualified
      person. On that issue the judge found in favour of the appellant.

  21. Accordingly, regulation 7(3) requires  the  respondent  to  treat  the
      appellant as  a  family  member  of  a  qualified  person  and,  under
      regulation 17(1), the issue of a residence card to such  a  person  is
      mandatory.

  22. In the circumstances, we re-make the decision by allowing  the  appeal
      and direct issue of the residence card that the appellant sought.
