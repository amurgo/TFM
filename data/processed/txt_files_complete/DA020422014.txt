                                                                  Respondent


Representation:


For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Lam, of Counsel, instructed by Messrs David
                    Tang & Company


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Colvin  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 8 July 2015,  allowed the appeal of  Mr  Merzak  Boutari
    against a decision of the Secretary of State made on 16 October 2014 to
    make  a  deportation  order  under  Regulations  24(3)  and  Regulation
    19(3)(b) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

2.   Although the Secretary of State is the appellant before me I  will  for
    ease of reference refer to  her  as  the  respondent  as  she  was  the
    respondent in the First-tier.  Similarly I  will  refer  to  Mr  Merzak
    Boutari as the appellant as he was the appellant in the First-tier.

3.   At the beginning of the hearing  Mr  Walker  produced  a  remand  order
    remanding the appellant in custody prior to a  trial  on  24  September
    2015 as he had been indicted for a further crime.  Mr Walker put to  me
    that, if convicted  that  would  be  an  indication  that  the  judge's
    findings that the appellant would not offend in the future were  wrong.
    He stated it might therefore be appropriate to adjourn the appeal.

4.   I considered it was appropriate however to  proceed  to  determine  the
    appeal before me as I was now seized of the appeal and the issue before
    me was whether or not the judge, on the evidence before her, had made a
    decision which contained a material error of law.

5.   The appellant claimed to have entered Britain in 2003 and it  is  known
    from his criminal record that in 2004 he was cautioned for shoplifting.
     He was convicted of further theft/shoplifting offences  the  following
    year and  received  a  conditional  discharge.   In  2009  he  made  an
    application for a  certificate  of  approval  for  marriage  which  was
    granted. He married a Polish national and was granted a residence  card
    valid until 1 July  2010  initially  which  was  then  extended  to  10
    November 2015.  There was  a  further  conviction  for  shoplifting  in
    November 2009 and in September 2010 he was also  convicted  and  fined.
    He was convicted of common assault in July 2012 for which he received a
    fine and  on  19  October  2012  he  was  convicted  to  conspiring  to
    dishonestly  make  false  representations  and  sentenced  to  eighteen
    months' imprisonment.  He had been released from prison on 14  November
    2014.  He is now again in prison pending trial  in  December.   It  was
    accepted that he had not acquired  the  right  of  permanent  residence
    under the 2006 Regulations.

6.   The judge heard evidence from the appellant and from his  wife  who  is
    Polish and has  a  daughter  J  who  is  now  living  in  Poland.   The
    appellant's wife stated that she would find it  difficult  to  live  in
    Algeria.  The appellant  has  an  uncle  here  who  has  children.   He
    asserted he had no friends in Algeria.

7.   The appellant stated that he had worked since  coming  to  Britain  and
    had studied IT in prison.  He regretted his offences.

8.   The judge noted that the respondent asserted  that  the  appellant  had
    been involved in a sophisticated crime involving fraudulent use of bank
    cards and purchased items in the region  of  approximately  �80,000  in
    total and she referred to the sentencing remarks in which the judge had
    said that he had conspired in November 2011 to obtain the  proceeds  of
    the account of a  Mr  Andreas  Mentzer  and  that  he  had  tricked  Mr
    Mentzer's bank into believing that he was Mr Mentzer so  that  a  debit
    card had been sent out to him which had been used to make purchases for
    the appellant who ran up debts  in  the  region  of  �40,000.  He  made
    attempts to obtain another �40,000.  The judge noted that  it  was  the
    view of the respondent that there was insufficient  evidence  that  the
    appellant had adequately addressed all the reasons  for  his  offending
    behaviour.  The Secretary of State considered that it is reasonable  to
    conclude  that  there  remained  a  risk  of  re-offending  should  the
    appellant find himself in need of money in the future.

9.   The judge noted that in a skeleton argument, Mr Lam  who  appeared  for
    the appellant before her had referred to Section 72 of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which stated that a  person  should  be
    presumed to have been convicted of  a  particularly  serious  crime  to
    constitute a danger to the community if the sentence  was  imprisonment
    for at least  two  years.   She  considered  that  on  that  basis  the
    appellant's sentence of eighteen months and the fact that the crime was
    not one of violence or drugs meant that it could not be  considered  to
    be a particularly serious crime.  She also noted that the OASys  scores
    showed a

         '... low risk of re-offending and that the appellant  had  been  in
         stable employment since his release from prison  in  November  2014
         and had shown remorse.'

10.  Having set out the terms of Regulations 19(3)(b) and Regulation 21  the
    judge set out her findings of fact and her conclusions in paragraphs 17
    onwards of the determination.  In paragraph 18 she  stated  that  there
    was no doubt that the index offences represented  a  serious  fraud  as
    described in the  sentencing  remarks  and  that  they  were  committed
    following a conviction history involving a series of dishonest offences
    of theft and shoplifting.  She noted that  it  was  accepted  that  the
    appellant was not offered a sentence plan or rehabilitation  course  in
    relation to the offences but had asserted that  he  had  taken  several
    other courses. She referred to and shown the certificate in his bundle.

11.  She went on to say that the only expert report before her was  that  of
    the OASys Report which had  assessed  that  the  appellant's  financial
    issues were linked to his offending behaviour and  said  there  was  no
    evidence that it is linked to a risk of  harm.   She  stated  that  his
    predictors course for general re-offending were 32% in year one, 49% in
    year two and that this was assessed as low.

12.  Having found that the appellant had a  genuine  relationship  with  his
    wife she noted that his wife had said it would be  extremely  hard  for
    her to live in Algeria and she would have to  give  up  her  job  as  a
    dental nurse which she had had for ten years.

13.  The judge then referred to the terms of Regulation 21 stating that  the
    principal matter was whether on the evidence before her  the  appellant
    represented a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat.   She
    went on to say:-

         "It is submitted on his behalf that the fact that he was  sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of less than two years  means  that  he
         does not, for example, come within the definition of constituting a
         danger to the community as stated in Section 72 of  the  2002  Act.
         It is also submitted  that  the  appellant's  offence  is  not  one
         referred to in Appendix B of the UKBA criminal case work  directive
         which lists those crimes which are defined  as  serious  and  which
         might  constitute  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
         security.  Further the  expert  report  submitted  -  the  OASys  -
         clearly refers to the risk of re-offending as being low.   It  also
         refers to the fact that his behaviour and attitudes when taking the
         index offences into account does not amount to a  risk  of  serious
         harm."

14.   She  went  on  to  state  that  she  had  to  consider  the  issue  of
    proportionality and then placed weight on the appellant's  relationship
    with his wife stating that there was no doubt in her view that his wife
    would find it unduly harsh to relocate to Algeria.  She added  that  in
    terms of rehabilitation the appellant's cooperating with the  Probation
    Service continued until November 2015 and he had gained  employment  as
    soon as he was released from prison and had not re-offended.

15.  The judge concluded in paragraph 24 by stating:-

         "Taking all these matters into account I have reached the view that
         on balance the appellant cannot be said  to  represent  a  genuine,
         present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society.  Although he  has  a  history  of
         criminal offences most of them are of a minor nature  and  for  the
         only serious offences committed he was sentenced to eighteen months
         imprisonment which is less than that considered to  constituting  a
         danger to the  community.   None  of  his  offences  have  involved
         violence or drugs.  He has shown that  he  is  in  the  process  of
         successfully being rehabilitated and the risk  of  re-offending  is
         low - although if he does commit any further offences the situation
         would clearly be different.  Further, I consider that it  would  be
         disproportionate to deport him when  also  taking  account  of  the
         hardship that would be caused to his wife if she were  required  to
         relocate in Algeria in order to continue her family life  with  the
         appellant."

    Accordingly the judge allowed the appeal.

16.  The respondent appealed arguing that the judge had misdirected  herself
    in law stating that the judge concluded  that  the  index  offence  was
    serious but had then stated that in accordance with Section 72  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act he did not constitute a  danger
    to the community and was not therefore a sufficiently  serious  threat.
    It was submitted that that was wrong as  Section  72  applied  for  the
    purpose of the constructioned  application  of  Article  33(2)  of  the
    Refugee Convention.

17.  It was also stated that the judge had conflated  the  assessment  under
    Regulation 21 with  what  was  required  under  paragraph  399  of  the
    Immigration Rules -  Section  117C  of  part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 when  she  had  considered  whether  it
    would be unduly harsh for the appellant's partner to return to Algeria.
     It  was  stated  that  that  was  not  a  relevant  threshold  with  a
    proportionality assessment under the Regulations.

18.  It was argued that she had erred in  interpreting  the  term  "genuine,
    present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  the  fundamental
    interests of society" as being an  offence which involved with violence
    or drugs when there was no such requirement under the Regulations.

19.  It was also argued that the judge had erred  in  seeking  to  undermine
    the findings of the sentencing judge and diminishing the seriousness of
    the appellant's offence and had failed to "lawfully engage" the risk of
    re-offending case which must contribute to the  notion  of  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat.  The fact that  the  appellant
    had been recorded as having a 49% likelihood of reconviction within two
    years.  While that was stated to be a low risk it seemed to be the more
    significant and of  any  such  risk  and  must  therefore  be  balanced
    accordingly.

20.  Reference  was  made  to  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Dumliauskas [2015] EWCA Civ 145 in which the court held the greater the
    risk of re-offending the greater the risk to deport:  the more  serious
    the risk of re-offending and the offences that might be  committed  the
    greater the right to interfere with the right of residence.

21.  It was also argued, referring again to  the  judgment  in  Dumliauskas,
    that  the  judge  had  erred  in  placing  weight  on  the  appellant's
    rehabilitative  efforts  when  the  prospect  of   rehabilitation   was
    irrelevant unless the offender had  a  permanent  right  of  residence.
    Substantial weight should not be given to rehabilitation.

22.  Mr Walker relied on the grounds of  appeal  emphasising  the  appellant
    was only entitled to a basic level of protection.  He referred  to  the
    fact that the Secretary of State was  entitled  to  consider  that  the
    index offence was serious and that the judge  had  erred  in  importing
    into consideration a consideration of the terms of Section  72  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Moreover it  was  argued
    that she had erred in the way in which she engaged with the risk of re-
    offending and that the proportionality  assessment  of  the  judge  was
    wrong.

23.  Mr Lam stated that there was no error of law in  the  determination  of
    the Tribunal.  He stated the judge had properly considered all relevant
    factors with regard to the Regulations and that  her  conclusions  were
    fully open to her.

24.  He accepted that an attempt to obtain �40,000 was a serious matter  but
    stated that the judge had been more nuanced in her consideration of the
    relevant issues.  She had been entitled to look at the  report  and  to
    repeat the terms of the report.  Although the Secretary  of  State,  in
    ground 2, asserted that she was incorrect to say that the risk  of  re-
    offending was low that was what was in the report.  He pointed out that
    the factual matrix in the judgment in Dumliauskas was totally different
    from offences such as that committed by the appellant.  This was not  a
    case where there had been violence and the judge was entitled  to  take
    into account the likelihood of rehabilitation.  Moreover the judge  had
    properly considered the issue of proportionality as was incumbent  upon
    her taking into account the terms of Regulation 21(5)(a).

Discussion

25.  I consider that certain of the grounds of appeal are disingenuous.   It
    is not the case for example that the judge considered that the relevant
    test of whether or not  the  appellant  had  committed  a  particularly
    serious crime was that set  out  in  Section  72  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 - where  the  judge  referred  to  that
    section in paragraph 21 of the determination she is merely referring to
    an example of a danger to the community  as  stated  in  that  section.
    Moreover she does also in that paragraph refer to  Appendix  B  of  the
    UKBA criminal casework directive which lists crimes which were  defined
    as serious and took into account the terms of the OASys Report.  It  is
    not, as alleged, the fact that she considered  that  the  risk  of  re-
    offending was low - that was a conclusion which she had taken from  the
    OASys Report.  She properly set out the terms of the  report  including
    the percentages of the risks of re-offending.  Indeed what she said was
    a direct quote from the report.  Moreover it is not the case  that  she
    imported into Regulation 21 the  provisions  of  Section  117C  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act.  What she was doing  when  she
    referred  to  the  term  of  unduly   harshness   was   assessing   the
    proportionality factors relating to the appellant's deportation and she
    was entitled to consider that such a  factor  was  the  impact  on  the
    deportation  on  the  appellant's  wife.   That  was  not  a   perverse
    consideration to take into account.

26.  Moreover with regard to the proportionality of  the  decision  and  the
    risk of offending it is not the case that the judge sought to undermine
    the findings of the sentencing  judge  -  indeed  she  refers  to  them
    specifically.  She weighed up the factors  before  her  and  reached  a
    conclusion which was open to her.  Although the grounds of appeal refer
    to the judgment in the case of Dumliauskas  the  reality  is  that  the
    facts in that case are very different.

27.  What the judge found was that it was  not  appropriate  to  deport  the
    appellant in the particular circumstances of his case  and  I  consider
    that her conclusions were open to her and were not in any way perverse.

28.  I therefore find that there  was  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the judge.

29.  The reality is, of course, that, should the appellant be  convicted  of
    a further offence then the arguments put forward by the judge that  the
    appellant had been rehabilitated would  clearly  be  considered  to  be
    wrong.  It would therefore, of course, at that stage  be  open  to  the
    respondent to make a further decision to deport.
