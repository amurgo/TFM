Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Burrett, Counsel, instructed by Nandy & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Walker promulgated on 16th September 2015, in which  she
    dismissed  these  four  Appellants'  appeals  in   respect   of   their
    applications for residence cards as  dependent  family  members  of  Mr
    Miguel Sumoya.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Walker did not accept the accounts  given  by
    the Appellants in respect of their dependency upon the EU national,  Mr
    Sumoya, and did not  accept  the  evidence  that  given  regarding  the
    tenancy agreements and accommodation in  respect  of  the  property  at
    Barking Road, London and therefore found that the Appellants  were  not
    entitled to residence cards as dependent family members of Mr Sumoya.

 3. The Appellants have now sought to appeal against that decision for  the
    reasons set out within the Grounds of Appeal.  Within  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal, it is firstly argued that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred
    in assessing the appeals of Mr Dionicio Cuellar Roman and Mrs Elizabeth
     Sumoya De Cuellar under the EEA Regulations, in  that  the  judge  has
    considered them as extended family members who would need to  establish
    dependency for the purpose of Regulation 8(2) of the Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006, rather than being direct relatives in  the  ascending
    line and therefore entitled as family members under Regulation 7(1)  of
    the Regulations.

 4. Within the second ground of appeal it is  argued  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  failed  to  properly  direct  himself  on  the  law  of
    dependency in relation to EEA appeals.  It is argued within the Grounds
    of Appeal that when considering  the  issue  of  dependency  the  judge
    failed to set out the criterion by which dependency was  to  be  judged
    and it is said that  the  judge  approached  the  issue  of  dependency
    applying a flawed analysis in that it is said that he  found  that  all
    the Appellants had to be fully financially dependent upon Miguel.

 5. Permission to appeal has  been  granted  in  this  case  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Heynes on 10th June 2016, in which he  decided  that  it
    was arguable that the judge had misdirected himself in law  by  failing
    to recognise that the first and second Appellants, Mr Roman and Mrs  De
    Cuellar, were family members rather than extended  family  members  and
    that he therefore erred in considering the question of  dependency.  It
    is on that basis the case came before me in the Upper Tribunal today.

 6.  I am grateful for the submissions made in this  case  by  Mr  Burrett,
    Counsel for the Appellants and Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting
    Officer for the Respondent.  Mr Tarlow sought to rely upon the Rule  24
    notice dated 4th July 2016 in which it was argued that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge directed himself appropriately and had taken account  of
    the evidence from the Appellants and found that there were conflicts in
    the various accounts relating to payment of utility bills, rent and  in
    whose name the tenancy was and the judge found at paragraph 38 that the
    Appellants were working and contributing towards household expenses and
    was entitled to find on this basis the Appellants were not  financially
    dependent upon Miguel.

 7. Mr Tarlow relies upon that Rule 24, but he noted  that  as  far  as  Mr
    Roman and Mrs De Cuellar are concerned it did not necessarily take  the
    matter too much further,  and  although  he  said  that  he  could  not
    formally concede the appeal, he did agree both that Mr Roman and Mrs De
    Cuellar are the parents of Miguel Sumoya the Spanish national, whom  it
    is accepted  was  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  UK,  that  under
    Regulation 7(1) of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  and  that
    they are dependent direct relatives in the ascending line of Mr  Miguel
    Sumoya for the purposes of Regulation 7, and as such would be  entitled
    to  residence cards as family members under Regulation  7.   They  were
    not extended family members and therefore  do  not  need  to  meet  the
    requirements of Regulation 8 (2) of the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006 in respect of dependency as set out by that Regulation.

 8. I do accept as far as the Appellant Mr Roman and  Mrs  De  Cuellar  are
    concerned, given the agreement on this point by Mr Tarlow, I do find as
    a fact that they are the parents of Mr Miguel Sumoya and that they  are
    dependent direct relatives in the ascending line and are family members
    for the purpose of Regulation 7.

 9. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Walker therefore does contain
    a material error of law in that the judge appears to  have  dealt  with
    the appeals of Mr Roman and Mrs De Cuellar under  Regulation  8  rather
    than specifically Regulation 7 and both parties agree  that  those  two
    appeals should be allowed under Regulation 7.

10. With regard the appeals of Mrs Maribel Cuellar  Sumoya  and  Mr  Freddy
    Sosa, although First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Heynes  found  that  it  was
    arguable that the first ground relating to the  parents  related  to  a
    material error of law he  did  not  specifically  grant  permission  to
    appeal in respect of what is now the third and fourth  Appellants,  Mrs
    Sumoya and Mr Sosa but did not specifically refuse them  permission  to
    appeal.

11. However, when considering ground 2 in respect  of  Mrs  Sumoya  and  Mr
    Sosa, when one looks at the actual decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge,  between  paragraphs  22  and  40  of  his  decision   he   gave
    consideration as to what was said to be discrepancies in  the  evidence
    relating to a tenancy agreement produced by the Appellants  in  respect
    of accommodation at Barking Road, London  at  paragraph  28  and  found
    discrepancies in the evidence regarding whether or not  Mr  Sumoya  had
    sufficient money to pay the household and food  alone,  let  alone  the
    financial needs of all the other Appellants.

12. I note and bear in mind that the Appellants' evidence before the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge was that they were  all  financially  dependent  on
    him, but the judge went  on  to  find  that  there  were  discrepancies
    regarding exactly how  much  the  rent  was  as  to  whether  that  was
    initially �1,100 per month or �1,200 and as to how this was paid  given
    Mr Sumoya's earnings of �985 per month.

13. The judge went on specifically to find that the Appellant's brother-in-
    law Mr Sosa was working albeit for cash and that he contributed towards
    the household expenses at paragraph 38 of the judgment.  He also  found
    that the brother-in-law confirmed that his wife was also working  until
    two years previously.

14. The First-tier Tribunal judge I therefore  find  has  given  clear  and
    adequate reasons for rejecting the account regarding what is said to be
    financial dependency of Mr Sosa and Mrs Sumoya.

15. I do not consider that that  assessment  in  terms  of  credibility  is
    adversely affected or anyway undermined as  a  result  of  the  judge's
    error in law in respect of the consideration of the appeal of Mr  Roman
    and Mrs De Cuellar as the reasons given by the judge for rejecting  the
    dependency of Mrs Sumoya and Mr Sosa remain perfectly valid.

16. I therefore dismiss the appeals in respect  of  the  third  and  fourth
    Appellants before the Upper Tribunal, Mrs Sumoya and Mr Sosa but  I  do
    find that there is a material error  in  respect  of  the  decision  in
    respect of Mr Roman and Mrs De Cuellar.

17. I therefore set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Walker
    in respect of the decisions of Mr Roman and Mrs De Cuellar and in light
    of  the  discussions  that  I  have  had   between   myself   and   the
    representatives I do find that the appeals  of  Mr  Roman  and  Mrs  De
    Cuellar should have been allowed as it is  now  agreed  that  they  are
    dependent direct relatives in the ascending family line  of  Mr  Sumoya
    and family members for the purposes of Regulation 7 and that  therefore
    they should have been  entitled to the residence card as claimed.

Notice of Decision

18. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Walker  in  respect  of  the
    Appellants Mr Roman and Mrs De Cuellar does contain a material error of
    law and it is set aside in respect of those two Appellants.

19. The decision in respect of the third and fourth Appellants, Mrs  Sumoya
    and Mr  Sosa  does  not  reveal  any  material  error  of  law  and  is
    maintained.

20. In respect of the appeals or Mr Roman and Mrs De Cuellar I  remake  the
    decision  allowing  their  appeals  under  Regulation  7  of  the   EEA
    Regulations 2006.

21. There was no application for anonymity before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and there has been no application for anonymity before me and I make no
    order in respect of anonymity.


Signed                                  Date 29th July 2016
