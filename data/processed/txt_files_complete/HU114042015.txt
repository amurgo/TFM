Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Palmer, Counsel, instructed by Barnes Harrild &
                    Dyer Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan who is now 77 years of age  and
    he appealed under Section 82(1) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    refuse his application for settlement outside the Immigration Rules.

 2. His appeal was heard by Judges of the First-tier Tribunal Judges  Froom
    and Siddall who in a lengthy document dismissed  the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds in a decision promulgated on 20th February 2017.

 3. It is useful to set out some of the judges' findings.  The Appellant is
    a retired tax inspector and two of his sons reside here and are British
    citizens.  Since arriving as a  visitor  in  April  2015  he  has  been
    residing with his youngest son and his wife and their  three  children.
    His oldest son lives nearby with his wife and five  children.   He  has
    significant physical problems all of which are set out in the decision.
     He was undecided about whether to have surgery on his knees.

 4. There was a report from a Dr Dhumad a Consultant Psychiatrist in  terms
    of the Appellant's mental health but  his  findings,  namely  that  the
    Appellant had a  significant  risk  of  committing  suicide,  were  not
    accepted by the Tribunal  and  there  is  no  challenge  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal to the reasons given by the two First-tier Tribunal Judges  on
    that point.

 5. The Tribunal accepted that the Appellant enjoyed emotional support from
    his family members and also that he felt unhappy  at  the  prospect  of
    returning to Pakistan.  He would much rather spend the rest of his life
    here.  The situation he now faces would inevitably  cause  anxiety  and
    the Tribunal said they "fully" recognised that the pain and  disability
    caused by his knee condition would cause him to feel low (paragraph  29
    of the decision).   The  Tribunal  also  accepted  that  the  Appellant
    required and recently acquired some help  to  look  after  himself  and
    accepted Ms Khan's evidence about the care she provides for her father-
    in-law.  They found that the evidence of  Mr  Muhammad  Khan  that  his
    father required nursing from a qualified nurse to  be  an  exaggeration
    (paragraph 31).

 6. The Tribunal went on to consider what the  position  would  be  if  the
    Appellant  did  return  to  Pakistan  and  referred  to  the   possible
    application for entry clearance (paragraph 33).   They  concluded  that
    the Appellant still owned a property in Sialkot in which he could  live
    because he could obtain vacant possession of all or part of the  house.



 7. The Tribunal referred to the cost of the care  assistance  in  Pakistan
    and had no hesitation in saying that the family would do  their  utmost
    to assist their father (paragraph 42).  With reference to  the  incomes
    available they noted the sums in paragraph 43 saying that there  was  a
    Santander  current  account  with  a  balance  consistently  well  over
    ï¿½50,000.

 8. In paragraph 47 they said  that  upheavals  were  difficult  for  older
    people and having relocated only two years ago it would undoubtedly  be
    extremely unsettling for the Appellant to have  to  return  now.   They
    said "we are very conscious of that fact".

 9. For reasons given they found there were no compelling circumstances  in
    this case referring to  various  jurisprudence.   They  considered  the
    terms of Section 117B of  the  2007  Act  and  referred  again  to  the
    possibility of the Appellant making an application from outside the  UK
    (paragraph 62).

10. In the final paragraph of  their  decision  they  said  they  had  much
    sympathy for the Appellant and  his  family  but  removal  would  be  a
    proportionate step and there would be no breach of Article 8.

11. Grounds of application were lodged.  Reference is made to  the  factual
    background which is not really a matter of dispute.   The  grounds  set
    out the summary of the Tribunal's conclusions and  go  on  to  identify
    possible errors in law.  In Ground 1 it is said  it  was  necessary  to
    consider the Rules relating to the adult  dependent  relatives  as  the
    government's published position on  the  public  interest  behind  them
    unambiguously declared it to be centred on the  economic  wellbeing  of
    the United Kingdom.  The Appellant could show highly compelling  family
    circumstances and removal would plainly be unjustified.  Reference  was
    made to Ruppiah v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 803 which was authority for  the
    proposition that a Tribunal cannot apply Section 117B rigidly so as  to
    produce a result which offended against Article 8  ECHR.   This  was  a
    case where the accepted evidence was that there had been no recourse to
    any public funds or NHS treatment whatsoever.  There was  therefore  no
    economic wellbeing  public  interest  element  which  could  rationally
    justify the Appellant's removal.  The second Ground of Appeal was  that
    the Tribunal  had  found  that  suitable  care  was  available  to  the
    Appellant in Pakistan by employing the services of  a  domestic  helper
    and was affordable.  This was unsustainable in light  of  the  evidence
    which included details of the Appellant having to rely  upon  his  male
    members to assist in dressing and washing him.  He would be  bereft  of
    family support and be highly  vulnerable.   Permission  to  appeal  was
    respectfully sought and the Upper Tribunal invited  to  set  aside  the
    Tribunal's decision and to retain the appeal to  determine  matters  of
    law raised in the submissions.

12. As it transpired the application for  permission  to  appeal  was  made
    slightly late but there is no need to go into that any  further  as  Ms
    Everett indicated she was not objecting to the  matter  being  admitted
    and heard before me.

13. Permission to appeal was initially refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Frankish but granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Gleeson (who did not  deal
    with the issue of whether the appeal was in time) but  noted  that  the
    Appellant challenged the decision on the basis that it was contrary  to
    jurisprudence and it was said that the Grounds of Appeal were arguable.



14. The Secretary of State lodged a Rule 24 notice saying that  the  judges
    had properly considered the Appellant's circumstances.  The findings in
    respect  of  the  Appellant's  medical  conditions  were  set  out   at
    paragraphs 19 to 30 and the judges had found that the Appellant  had  a
    house in Pakistan and his care could be provided by a domestic  helper.
    There was also evidence that there were  ample  funds  to  support  the
    Appellant.  The Tribunal has  had  regard  to  the  Appellant's  mental
    health and it was noted in paragraph 60 the bond that he had  with  his
    family in the UK.  The Tribunal had properly considered  the  arguments
    of the Appellant's Counsel at the hearing and had regard to case law.

15. Before me Mr Palmer relied on his grounds.  This was a  case  where  an
    Appellant, if removed, would be miserable and prone to depression.   It
    was an appeal outside the Rules and compelling circumstances  had  been
    shown.  He could not rely on his family in Pakistan.  He  would  be  on
    his own.  The decision was not proportionate.  In terms of  the  points
    taken by Ms Everett he said that this was not  a  case  being  assessed
    under the Immigration Rules.  As such it was not  a  case  where  great
    weight should be given to the provision of those Rules.  Reference  was
    made to the skeleton argument at point 3.2 where it was said  that  the
    Secretary of State's "statement of intent" which  preceded  the  coming
    into force of Appendix FM stated  that  the  Rules  relating  to  adult
    dependent relatives were that they would only be able to settle in  the
    UK if they can demonstrate that they  required  a  level  of  long-term
    personal care that could only be provided in the UK by  their  relative
    here and without recourse to public funds.  The matter came down to the
    Razgar point of whether or not  it  was  proportionate  to  remove  the
    Appellant.  There was no public interest element  in  removing  him  to
    Pakistan.  I was invited to set the decision aside  and  to  remit  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal or alternatively retain the appeal in
    the Upper Tribunal.

16. For the Home Office Ms Everett relied  on  the  Rule  24  notice.   The
    judges  had  clearly  noted  the  Appellant's  emotional  needs  -  see
    paragraphs 29 and 30 of the  decision.   They  had  accepted  that  the
    Appellant received and reasonably required help to look after  himself.
    In terms of paragraphs 62 and 63 of the decision  they  had  considered
    that the harshness of the decision was ameliorated by  the  possibility
    of making an application from  outside  the  UK  -  there  was  nothing
    unreasonable in those findings.  They had given weight to the Secretary
    of State's Rules which did not cover every single case  but  they  were
    correct to attach weight to whether the Rules are met.

17. I was asked to conclude that there was no material error in law.

18. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions

19. My task is to ascertain whether there is an error in law by the  judges
    in concluding, as they did, there would no breach  of  the  Appellant's
    qualified but fundamental rights under Article 8 if he was returned  to
    Pakistan.  In my view there is no doubt this is one of those  difficult
    cases where other judges might have reached a  different  decision  but
    that is in no way the test which has to be applied on  whether  or  not
    the judges erred in law.

20. It is not disputed that the Tribunal  were  entitled  and  in  my  view
    correct to conclude that the evidence of the Consultant Psychiatrist Dr
    Dhumad could not be relied on when  he  said  that  the  Appellant  was
    suffering from severe depression and presented as a suicide risk.   The
    evidence does not justify such a conclusion and there  was  no  dispute
    about that.

21.  In  terms  of  whether  the  Tribunal  applied  the  correct  test  in
    determining the issue of public interest and proportionality  it  seems
    to me that the Tribunal were very aware of  the  vulnerability  of  the
    Appellant in returning to Pakistan and being absent  from  his  family.
    In particular in paragraph 29 they said that the situation he now faced
    would inevitably cause anxiety.  They fully recognised  that  the  pain
    and disability caused by his new condition would cause him to feel low.
     They said he may be experiencing some symptoms of depression but these
    were evidently mild  because  they  did  not  require  treatment.   The
    Appellant had told them that he thought his depression had gone.   They
    also accepted (paragraph 30) that he received and  reasonably  required
    help to look after himself.  They detailed  what  that  help  involved.
    However they did find that Mr Muhammad Khan's evidence that his  father
    required nursing from a qualified nurse to  be  an  exaggeration.   His
    wife was not a qualified nurse.

22. They went on to consider the available suitable care for the  Appellant
    in Pakistan.  They were entitled to, indeed bound to, take into account
    the financial position of the Appellant's family in  this  country  and
    they did so at paragraphs 41 to 44 inclusive.

23. They said they  were  "very  conscious"  of  the  fact  that  it  would
    undoubtedly be extremely unsettling for the Appellant to have to return
    to Pakistan.  For  reasons  given  in  paragraph  49  they  had  little
    difficulty in finding there were compelling circumstances justifying an
    assessment of Article  8  and  found  that  there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances to grant  the  appeal.   They  correctly  approached  the
    evaluation of Article 8 by reference to the five questions to be  asked
    in Razgar [2004]  UKHL  27.   They  referred  to  Britcits  R  (on  the
    application of) v SSHD [2016] EWHC 956 (Admin) and MM (Lebanon) v  SSHD
    [2015] 1 WLR 1073.  They correctly found that  removing  the  Appellant
    would  amount  to  significant  interference  with  his   family   life
    (paragraph 53).

24. They set out the points for and against the Appellant with reference to
    well-established case law and noted in paragraph 61 that when  it  came
    down to finding where the proportionality balance took place they  felt
    compelled to find it fell on the public interest side of the scales due
    to the weight which must be given to it.  They were correct to say that
    Parliament had decided that adult dependent relatives  cannot  "switch"
    in the UK and even to obtain  admission  on  this  basis  they  had  to
    demonstrate they met certain requirements of Appendix FM and  specified
    evidence rules found in Appendix FM-SE.  They were  right  to  consider
    whether the harshness of decision was ameliorated by the possibility of
    the Appellant making an application from outside the UK. They  referred
    to and applied well-known case law.

25. They also noted the ability of the family to  visit  the  Appellant  in
    Pakistan as they did in 2015.

26. They had much sympathy for the Appellant and his family  but  concluded
    that the correct application of the law  to  the  facts  delivered  the
    conclusion  that  the  decision  to  remove   the   Appellant   was   a
    proportionate step.

27. It can be repeated that the Appellant is a  highly  vulnerable  witness
    and one must  have  considerable  sympathy  for  him  and  his  family.
    Nevertheless the question before me is whether or not the Judges of the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  In my view their reasoning is  clear
    and coherent and there is no material or indeed any error in law  which
    would justify the decision being set aside.

28. Ii follows that the decision must stand.

Notice of Decision

29. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

30. I do not set aside the decision.

31. No anonymity order is made.
