                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   In September 2007 Samuel Anning, a Ghanaian citizen  who  is  now  aged
    31, was issued with a residence card, valid  for  five  years,  as  the
    'extended family member' of his brother, Frank Anning, who had acquired
    Dutch nationality and was exercising 'Treaty rights' as an employee  of
    Mitie Cleaning Ltd.  On 28th August 2012, shortly before the expiry  of
    the five-year period, Samuel applied for a permanent residence card  on
    the basis of five years' continuous residence in  accordance  with  the
    EEA Regulations 2006, as provided for by regulation 15(1)(b)  of  those
    Regulations.  The application form gave Samuel's address as 50,  Forest
    Rise in Milton Keynes, which was evidenced by a Council  Tax  bill  for
    the year 2012-2013.  The charge for 50, Forest Rise that year was �861,
    net of a 25% discount for single occupancy.  Evidence was also attached
    showing that Frank was now working for Ocean Contract Cleaning Ltd, and
    his address was given as  10,  Coachmaker  Court,  Milton  Keynes.   No
    evidence was adduced as to how Samuel was able to maintain  a  separate
    household at Forest Rise.

2.    The application was refused on 2nd January 2013.  The  author  of  the
    'reasons for refusal' letter was under the impression that the  earlier
    application in 2007 had been on  the  basis  that  Frank  was  Samuel's
    father, not his brother.  That can hardly be right, as Frank is only 13
    years older than Samuel.  The caseworker was also under the  impression
    that the Council Tax bill was for Frank's residence, not Samuel's,  and
    inferred from the fact  that  there  was  a  25%  discount  for  single
    occupancy that Samuel could not be resident in the  same  household  as
    Frank "and thus not dependent."  The caseworker seems not to have  been
    aware that dependency and household membership  are  separate  ways  of
    establishing that one is an 'extended family member'.  They do not have
    to coexist.

3.   An appeal to the First-tier Tribunal came before Judge Pirotta on  13th
    May 2013, when it was conceded on behalf of the Secretary of State that
    Frank and Samuel are brothers.  The Appellant's Bundle provided by  BWF
    Solicitors includes a witness statement by Samuel, in which he makes no
    mention of Forest Rise but says that  he  has  always  lived  with  his
    brother, first in Edmonton and  then,  since  2008,  at  10  Coachmaker
    Court, where he now resides.  In another witness statement, Frank  says
    the same thing about living with Samuel, first in Edmonton  and,  since
    2008, at Coachmaker  Court.   At  the  hearing,  however,  Samuel  gave
    evidence that he had left Coachmaker Court in  November  2009  and  had
    lived with his two children, now aged 4 and 2, at 50 Forest Rise  until
    November 2012, when he moved back to Coachmaker Court.  He had not seen
    the mother of the two children since six months after the birth of  the
    younger child, as she had disappeared.  Frank confirmed that Samuel had
    come back to Coachmaker Court in November 2012, having previously lived
    there until around October 2009.

4.   Samuel also said that he had been working continuously since 2007,  and
    was currently working 40 hours  per  week,  although  he  was  also  in
    receipt of Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and Child Benefit.  But
    because his expenses were too great, Frank had  been  helping  him  out
    financially, to the tune  of  around  �100  a  month  in  cash.   Frank
    confirmed that he was indeed giving Samuel �100 a month.   Despite  the
    inclusion in the Appellant's Bundle of bank  statements  from  Barclays
    showing that in May, June and July 2012 Samuel had received  more  than
    �1,000 a month in salary from UK Mail and over �500 a month in  Working
    Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, to say nothing  of  �125  a  month  in
    Housing Benefit and �33.70 a  week  in  Child  Benefit,  Judge  Pirotta
    considered that Samuel was dependent on Frank and that  "any  financial
    dependency is sufficient to meet the  Regulations."   That  astonishing
    conclusion  was  challenged  by  the  Secretary  of  State  in  seeking
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

5.   Judge Pirotta did not actually allow  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that
    Samuel had acquired a right of permanent  residence  in  the  UK.   She
    found that he had not resided in the UK for a continuous period of five
    years in accordance with the EEA Regulations,  because  the  continuity
    had been broken by Frank's absence in Ghana between May  and  September
    2008.  As I mentioned at today's hearing, and as Mr Wilding had already
    realised, she was wrong about  that.   Regulation  3(2)(a)  permits  an
    absence of up to six months before continuity is broken, and Frank  had
    only been away for four months.  But it is clear in any event that  for
    three out of the five years before he applied for a permanent residence
    card,  Samuel  was  living  in  separate  accommodation,  working   and
    fathering children, and was not dependent on Frank.

6.   The appeal was allowed on the basis that, as at the  date  of  hearing,
    Samuel was both dependent on Frank  and  a  member  of  his  household.
    Thus, according to Judge Pirotta, he met  the  criteria  of  regulation
    8(2)(a) that he should be "residing in an EEA State in  which  the  EEA
    national also resides."  Once again, that was a surprisingly  erroneous
    conclusion for the judge to have reached.  The United  Kingdom  is  not
    'an EEA State' for the purposes of the EEA Regulations :  see  reg.  2.
    In any event, the words "in an EEA State" had  been  replaced  in  June
    2011 by "in a country other than the United Kingdom", as was clear from
    an extract from the EEA Regulations which was handed up to  the  judge.
    For that matter, the word "in which the EEA national also resides" were
    deleted in November 2012.  This paragraph refers,  of  course,  to  the
    situation of an extended family member before he comes  to  the  United
    Kingdom, not when he is already here.

7.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  sought,  and  granted,
    only on the issue of dependency, and when the  matter  came  before  me
    today, it being accepted on all hands that the First-tier Tribunal  had
    made the errors of law described  above,  Miss  Okyere-Darko  contended
    that these were not material errors, since the judge had got  it  right
    on the issue of household membership.  Even if  the  evidence  did  not
    entitle her to find  that  Samuel  was  dependent  on  Frank,  she  was
    entitled on the evidence to find that Samuel was once again a member of
    Frank's household, and hence was an  extended  family  member  who  was
    eligible for another five-year residence card.  Mr Wilding argued  that
    living under the same roof as Frank was not enough on its own  to  make
    Samuel a member of Frank's  household,  and  that  more  needed  to  be
    disclosed about what the arrangements were.  I took the view  that  the
    errors of law on the other aspects of the appeal  were  such  that  the
    conclusion on household membership could not be regarded as  unaffected
    by those errors, and hence able to stand on its own as  a  freestanding
    reason for allowing the appeal.  It was appropriate  therefore  to  set
    aside the First-tier determination and  re-make  the  decision  on  the
    appeal.  As Samuel and Frank Anning were both present, and there was  a
    Twi interpreter available, we were able to proceed  without  having  to
    adjourn the case.

8.   In their oral evidence, the brothers both averred that  they  had  been
    living together at 10, Coachmaker Court since November last  year,  but
    in cross-examination Mr Wilding probed whether this was  so.   He  took
    Samuel Anning to several of the documents included in  the  Appellant's
    Bundle, starting with a series of T-Mobile  bills  sent  to  Samuel  at
    Coachmaker Court between  December  2008  and  May  2009.   These  were
    followed by a letter sent by T-Mobile to Samuel at Coachmaker Court  in
    April 2013.  Mr Wilding inquired why there was such a long gap  between
    the series of bills ending in May 2009 and the letter  of  April  2013.
    Samuel insisted that he threw away most of the T-Mobile bills which  he
    received, but Mr Wilding suggested that the reason for the long gap was
    that T-Mobile bills  during  the  three-year  period  when  Samuel  was
    avowedly living elsewhere would have continued being sent to Coachmaker
    Court.  So the fact that a  letter  from  T-Mobile  had  been  sent  to
    Coachmaker Court this year did not necessarily  mean  that  Samuel  was
    living there.

9.   Samuel had also adduced two  bank  statements  from  the  Halifax,  for
    January and March 2013, addressed to  him  at  Coachmaker  Court.   The
    January statement showed one transaction, a deposit of �40,  while  the
    March statements showed two transactions, a deposit of �300 followed by
    the withdrawal of �310 by BWF Solicitors.  Mr Wilding asked Samuel what
    the Halifax account was actually for.  It contrasted with the  Barclays
    statements sent to Forest  Rise,  which  was  the  account  into  which
    Samuel's income and all his benefits were paid, and  out  of  which  he
    paid for  all  his  day-to-day  expenses.   Samuel  asserted  that  his
    Barclays statements were now being sent to Coachmaker  Court.   But  he
    had not thought to bring any.

10.  Samuel went on to say that he had not seen the mother of  his  children
    for seven months.  The two children were living with him at  Coachmaker
    Court, where Frank also lived with his  wife  and  four  children.   He
    denied Mr Wilding's suggestion that he was not living there at all, but
    was still living at Forest Rise.  I was shown Samuel's driving licence,
    which gives his address as Coachmaker Court.

11.  Frank now gave oral evidence, in which he  confirmed  that  Samuel  was
    living in his household and  helping  out  with  contributions  to  the
    household bills.  He was in fact earning quite a lot more  than  Frank.
    As for Samuel's two children, however, Frank did not  know  where  they
    lived.  He only saw them on Sundays at church,  with  "the  lady"  (viz
    their mother).  When Mr Wilding expressed surprise  that  Frank  should
    not know where his nephews lived, he indicated that he did not  approve
    of the fact that his brother had fathered  them  out  of  wedlock.   He
    confirmed that when Samuel was not staying at  Coachmaker  Court,  mail
    would still arrive there for him, which he would come and collect.  But
    Frank denied the  suggestion  that  Samuel  was  not  living  there  at
    present.  When Mr Wilding put it to him that according to  Samuel,  the
    two children were living at Coachmaker Court, he could only say that he
    sees them every Sunday with "the lady".

12.  In his closing submissions, Mr Wilding drew attention  to  the  failure
    of both Samuel and Frank Anning to mention in their witness  statements
    that Samuel had ever moved  out  of  Coachmaker  Court.   When  it  was
    obvious from the documents reproduced in the Appellant's Bundle that he
    had, a story was concocted that he had moved back in after applying for
    a permanent residence  card.   But  the  Halifax  account  giving  that
    address was manifestly only for  show,  while  the  fact  that  certain
    documents had been sent to Samuel there  (including  two  letters  from
    House of Champions Ministries, and a reply by Milton Keynes College  to
    an inquiry by Samuel, which were handed up today) did not mean that  he
    was actually living at that address.  The most cogent evidence that  he
    was not living there came  in  the  form  of  the  serious  discrepancy
    between the evidence of Samuel and that of  his  brother  as  to  where
    Samuel's children were living.  That the  brothers  could  not  give  a
    consistent account of such a basic fact of  life  at  Coachmaker  Court
    cast doubt on the credibility of the entire story.

13.  In her closing submissions, Miss Okyere-Darko contended valiantly  that
    despite the discrepancy highlighted by Mr  Wilding,  there  was  enough
    evidence to establish that Samuel  himself  was  living  at  Coachmaker
    Court, and hence was the extended family member of an EEA national  who
    was exercising 'Treaty rights'.

14.  Mr Wilding's skilful cross-examination has, in my judgment, exposed  as
    a sham Samuel Anning's attempt to pass himself off as a member  of  his
    brother's household.  The Halifax statements giving Samuel's address as
    Coachmaker Court bore the statement number 15 for January 2013  and  17
    for March 2013, so one can readily work out that  the  first  statement
    must have been sent out in November 2011, when Samuel was avowedly  not
    living at Coachmaker Court.  Neither the  Halifax  statements  nor  the
    other correspondence sent to Samuel at Coachmaker Court prove  that  he
    has been living there in recent months, while Samuel's allegation  that
    the children are living with him and that their mother has  disappeared
    has been given the lie by Frank's evidence that the children are  being
    looked after by their mother.  One can readily  infer  that  she  lives
    with them at Forest Rise, although Milton Keynes Council  were  unaware
    of that last year, when they gave a 25% discount off  the  Council  Tax
    for the property, on the basis that only one adult was living there.

15.  The upshot is that Samuel Anning is neither a dependant  nor  a  member
    of the household of an EEA national who  is  a  'qualified  person'  in
    terms of the EEA Regulations 2006, and hence he is not  entitled  to  a
    residence card.


     DECISION

     The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.

     The order for anonymity made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  wholly
    inappropriate for a case of this sort, and is not maintained.
