Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Saeed, Counsel, instructed by Aman Solicitors
Advocates
     (London) Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Abebrese (the judge), promulgated on 24 October 2016, in
    which he dismissed the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.  That  appeal
    had been against the Respondent's decision of 18 June 2015, refusing  a
    human rights application which was itself  made  on  9  February  2015.
    That application was based upon the  Appellant's  relationship  with  a
    British national, a relationship that it  was  said  had  been  ongoing
    since 2013, with cohabitation beginning in the  spring  of  2014.   The
    Respondent's  decision  was  based  primarily  on  a  consideration  of
    Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.  It was said that the Appellant's
    partner was not, in fact, a "partner"  as  defined  under  GEN.1.2.  of
    Appendix FM.  This was because the Respondent took the view that  there
    had not been two years of cohabitation  prior  to  the  making  of  the
    application.  In light of this, EX.1 could not be relied  on.   At  the
    time of the decision the couple did not have any children.  It was also
    said that paragraph 276ADE could not be satisfied  in  this  particular
    case.




The judge's decision

 2. The judge accepted that at the date of decision before him (that  being
    23 September 2016) the Appellant's partner was pregnant with a due date
    in November or December of that year.  At paragraph 34  he  finds  that
    the Appellant and his partner  had  not  in  fact  been  cohabiting  as
    claimed.  This, said the  judge,  was  due  to  the  lack  of  evidence
    provided by the couple on this particular issue.  As a result  of  this
    finding the judge concludes  that  the  Appellant  could  not  rely  on
    Appendix FM.

 3. In respect of the partner's pregnancy the judge  concluded  that  since
    the baby was not yet born this  had  no  relevance  to  the  Article  8
    assessment within,  or  indeed,  without  the  context  of  the  Rules.
    Paragraph 276ADE is considered, but the judge finds that this  did  not
    assist the Appellant in any way.

 4. In turning to the assessment of Article 8 outside the  context  of  the
    Rules the judge accepted that the Appellant and his partner were indeed
    in a genuine relationship, but at paragraphs 43 and  48  he  reiterates
    his conclusion that they  had  not  been  cohabiting  as  claimed.   In
    addition, the judge considers particular factors  relevant  to  section
    117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.   He  finds
    that the Appellant was not financially independent, there was a lack of
    evidence as to his ability to speak English, and that little weight was
    to be given to both his private life and the family life  enjoyed  with
    his partner, given the precariousness  of  his  status  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 5. Overall, the judge concludes  that  it  would  be  reasonable  for  the
    Appellant to be removed from the United Kingdom and on  this  basis  he
    dismissed the appeal.




The grounds of appeal and the grant of permission

 6. The  grounds  assert  that  in  concluding  that  there  had  not  been
    cohabitation, the judge overlooked documentary evidence and indeed  the
    evidence of the Appellant and  the  sponsor.   It  is  said  that  this
    evidence went to show that there had in  fact  been  cohabitation  from
    March 2014 onwards.  The grounds assert  that  the  error  is  material
    because it led the judge to conclude that the Appellant could not  rely
    on EX.1 under Appendix FM.  The grounds also  assert  in  more  general
    terms that the error relating to cohabitation  had  an  impact  on  the
    overall proportionality assessment as well.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson on  13
    April 2017.




The hearing before us

 8. Mr Saeed accepted that the error made in respect  of  the  cohabitation
    issue was not material to the satisfaction of Appendix  FM.   This  was
    because, even on the Appellant's case, the cohabitation  had  not  been
    for two years preceding  a  date  of  application.  However,  Mr  Saeed
    submitted that the fact of cohabitation went to the quality and  nature
    of the couple's relationship and this, he said,  was  relevant  to  the
    overall assessment of proportionality outside the context of the Rules.



 9. Mr Whitwell accepted that the length and duration of a relationship was
    a relevant factor, but he asked us to consider the judge's decision  as
    a whole.  In essence he submitted that any error was not material.




Decision on error of law

10. As we announced to the parties at the hearing,  we  conclude  that  the
    judge did materially err in law.

11. Having considered the papers that were before the judge for  ourselves,
    we are satisfied that there was  evidence  in  the  form  of  documents
    contained in the Appellant's bundle  (for  example  utility  bills  and
    Council Tax bills) and the contents of the witness statements  of  both
    the Appellant and his partner,  all  of  which  supported  the  claimed
    cohabitation from March 2014 onwards.  It is clear from the face of the
    judge's decision that he has overlooked this evidence and/or failed  to
    make any findings in respect of it.  There  is  no  suggestion  on  the
    judge's part that he deemed the evidence as a whole  to  be  unreliable
    and thus we cannot conclude that he was simply  rejecting  all  of  the
    evidence  without  specific  mention  of   that   pertaining   to   the
    cohabitation issue.  Indeed,  the  judge  accepted  that  there  was  a
    genuine and subsisting  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  his
    partner and thus, at least on that core issue, he was  accepting  their
    evidence.

12. In light of what we have said above, the  judge  erred  in  failing  to
    consider and/or make findings on evidence that was before him.

13. It is right that this error  cannot  be  material  in  respect  of  the
    application of Appendix FM.  This is because, as Mr Saeed accepted  and
    as is set out in the Respondent's rule 24 notice,  the  period  of  two
    years cohabitation for the purposes of GEN.1.2.(iv)  must  precede  the
    making of  the  application.   On  the  Appellant's  own  evidence  the
    cohabitation began only in March of 2014: clearly not a two-year period
    prior to the making of the application in February of 2015.

14. However, we find  that  the  failure  to  deal  with  the  evidence  on
    cohabitation has infected the judge's assessment of Article  8  outside
    the context of the Rules.  The importance of the lack  of  cohabitation
    is restated in paragraphs 43 and 48 of his decision.  We are  satisfied
    that it clearly played a material role in his assessment of the Article
    8 claim.

15. We fully acknowledge that the  judge  went  through  a  number  of  the
    mandatory factors set out in section 117B of the 2002 Act.  However, we
    remind ourselves that these factors are not  exhaustive  and  that  all
    relevant circumstances must be weighed in the balance.  The fact  of  a
    significant period of cohabitation in our view went to the  nature  and
    quality of the Appellant's relationship with his partner and this is  a
    factor it was incumbent on the judge to consider on a  correct  factual
    basis.  This he  failed  to  do,  given  his  error  on  the  issue  of
    cohabitation.

16. In light of our conclusions the judge's decision is set aside.




Remaking the decision

17. Both representatives were agreed that we could remake the  decision  in
    light of the evidence now before us.   This  includes  the  Appellant's
    bundle that was before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  importantly,  a
    supplementary bundle submitted in preparation for  the  hearing  before
    us.  An application under rule 15(2A) of the Upper  Tribunal  Procedure
    Rules was made, and we have  admitted  the  supplementary  bundle  into
    evidence without opposition from Mr Whitwell.

18. By way of submissions Mr Whitwell made  no  challenge  to  any  of  the
    evidence (including, significantly,  the  fact  of  the  birth  of  the
    couple's child on 11 November 2016), the fact  that  that  child  is  a
    British citizen, and  the  updated  documentary  evidence  relating  to
    continuing cohabitation.  He submitted  that  public  interest  factors
    were still in play, although he acknowledged that it may  be  difficult
    to argue that it would be reasonable for a British national baby and  a
    British national partner to go and live in Afghanistan.

19. Mr Saeed, not surprisingly, relied heavily on the fact of  the  child's
    birth and nationality.  He referred us in particular to section 117B(6)
    of the 2002 Act.

20. We reserved our decision on the remaking decision.

21. We have concluded that the Appellant's appeal should  be  allowed.   We
    now set out the findings and reasons  upon  which  this  conclusion  is
    based.

22. We have no hesitation in finding that  the  Appellant  has  been  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with his  British  citizen  partner
    since 2013.  This aspect of the evidence has been accepted by the judge
    and has at no stage been challenged before us.  We also find  that  the
    Appellant and his partner have in fact cohabited since March  of  2014.
    The claim, as mentioned earlier, is  fully  supported  by  the  witness
    statements of both, plus the  various  items  of  documentary  evidence
    contained in the Appellant's original bundle (see for  example  C92  to
    C93, C94 to C115 and D47 to D50 of  that  bundle).   In  addition,  the
    supplementary bundle contains updated utility bills, a Council Tax bill
    and medical correspondence, all showing  the  appropriate  address  and
    linking both the Appellant and his partner to that property.

23. We find that the Appellant is a father of a British child, J,  born  on
    11  November  2016.   Her  birth  certificate  is  contained   in   the
    supplementary bundle at page 13.  The Appellant is named as the father,
    and his partner as the mother.  The child's nationality would, we find,
    be derived from that of her mother.

24. We now assess the Article 8 claim outside the  context  of  the  Rules.
    There is clearly a family life as between the  Appellant,  his  partner
    and his daughter.  The Appellant's  removal  from  the  United  Kingdom
    would clearly constitute a sufficiently serious interference  with  his
    family life as to engage Article 8.  The Respondent's decision  pursues
    a legitimate aim and is in accordance with the law.

25. We move on to the core issue of proportionality.  We take into  account
    all relevant factors.  The core focus for us is section 117B(6) of  the
    2002 Act.  It is quite clear that the Appellant has a genuine  parental
    relationship with his British  daughter.   The  essential  question  is
    whether it is reasonable for his daughter to leave the United  Kingdom.
    In assessing  the  issue  of  reasonableness  we  have  regard  to  the
    decisions of the Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA  Civ  705
    and AM (Pakistan) [2017] EWCA Civ 180.

26. The child's nationality is  clearly  a  very  significant  factor.   We
    assess her best interests as very firmly lying in the  United  Kingdom.
    It is the country of her nationality and the place in which  she  would
    enjoy the  rights  and  privileges  pertaining  to  its  citizens.   By
    contrast, Afghanistan is an unstable place of relocation,  to  say  the
    very least.  Neither the child nor  the  Appellant's  partner  has  any
    connection to that country other than the fact of the  Appellant's  own
    nationality.  We have regard to the  Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Office
    travel advice contained in the Appellant's supplementary  bundle  which
    is clear; advising against all but essential travel  to  that  country,
    and advising against  any  travel  whatsoever  to  a  number  of  areas
    therein.

27. We have regard, of course, to the importance of the public interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration control; that is a  powerful  factor,
    on any view.  The Appellant himself does not appear to  be  financially
    independent, being reliant upon his partner, and there is, it seems,  a
    lack of evidence in respect  of  his  ability  to  speak  a  reasonable
    standard of English.  Those matters would therefore count against  him.



28. We also have regard to the lack of status on the Appellant's  part  and
    the fact that his relationship with his partner was established and has
    been ongoing in light of a lack of status.  This  clearly  reduces  the
    weight to be attached to the relationship.

29. We take into account our evaluation that it would not be reasonable for
    the Appellant's partner as a  British  citizen  to  relocate  and  live
    permanently in Afghanistan.  She has no  connection  to  that  country,
    cannot speak any of the languages, and will in our view  stand  out  as
    someone who may well face particular problems  if  attempting  to  live
    there.

30. We  also  take  account  of,  and  place  significant  weight  on,  the
    Respondent's own policy guidance as contained in  paragraph  11.2.3  of
    Appendix FM 1.0b.  The relevant passage states:


             "Would it be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to
             leave the UK?


             Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker must
             not take a decision in relation to the parent or primary carer
             of a British Citizen child where the effect of that decision
             would be to force that British child to leave the EU,
             regardless of the age of that child. This reflects the
             European Court of Justice judgment in Zambrano.


             The decision maker must consult the following guidance when
             assessing cases involving criminality:
             ( Criminality Guidance in ECHR Cases (internal)
             ( Criminality Guidance in ECHR Cases (external)


             Where a decision to refuse the application would require a
             parent or primary carer to return to a country outside the EU,
             the case must always be assessed on the basis that it would be
             unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU
             with that parent or primary carer.


             In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to
             the parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the
             UK with the child, provided that there is satisfactory
             evidence of a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.


             It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where
             the conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to
             considerations of such weight as to justify separation, if the
             child could otherwise stay with another parent or alternative
             primary carer in the UK or in the EU. The circumstances
             envisaged could cover amongst others:
             ( criminality falling below the thresholds set out in
             paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules;
             ( a very poor immigration history, such as where the person
             has repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration
             Rules."
                                             (underlining added)

31. This guidance, in our view, states the Respondent's clear  position  as
    being that it is, in absence of  criminality  or  a  particularly  poor
    immigration  history  (none  of  which  apply  in  the  present  case),
    unreasonable to expect a British child to leave the United  Kingdom/EU.
    We note that the same guidance was before the Tribunal  in  the  recent
    decision of SF and others (Guidance, post-2014 Act) Albania [2017] UKUT
    00120 (IAC).  Mr Whitwell has not sought to resile from the contents of
    the passage quoted above.  We conclude that we are  entitled  to  place
    significant weight upon this, representing as it  does  the  considered
    view of the Secretary of State, she  being  the  executive  arbiter  of
    where the balance lies as between the public interest and the rights of
    individuals through not only the making of the Immigration Rules (which
    of  course  includes  the  concept  of  reasonableness),  but  also  in
    introducing legislation such as Part 5A to the 2002 Act.

32. Having regard to all of the above, we conclude that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable for the Appellant's daughter to leave the United Kingdom.

33. In light of that conclusion and what is said at paragraphs 17 to 21  of
    MA (Pakistan),  as  reaffirmed  in  AM  (Pakistan),  the  Appellant  is
    therefore entitled to succeed in his appeal on Article 8 grounds.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is therefore set aside.

We remake the decision by allowing the appeal. The Appellant's removal  from
the United Kingdom would breach his rights under Article 8 ECHR,  and  would
therefore be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  a
full award of �140.00. The Appellant has succeeded in his  appeal.  Although
his circumstances have changed during the course of the  appellate  process,
the Respondent has maintained her position in the appeal throughout.
