                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. First-tier Tribunal Judge Doyle dismissed SR's appeal  following  a
        hearing at North Shields in May 2011. This  determination  was  set
        aside as it was found to be arguable that he erred  in  failing  to
        consider country conditions  although  his  factual  findings,  bar
        those relating to risk on return, are preserved. The  matter  comes
        before this Tribunal to enable it to ascertain whether SR will face
        a real risk on return to Pakistan as a result of his ethnicity  and
        political beliefs.



Background


     2. SR was born in January 1988 in Pakistan. He arrived in  the  United
        Kingdom on 25th February 2011 and claimed asylum on the  28th.  His
        claim was rejected and on 23rd March 2011 removal  directions  were
        set to Pakistan.


     3. The core of SR's claim to be at risk is based  upon  his  political
        opinion.  He claims to fear the Pakistani authorities as  a  result
        of his involvement with  the  Balochistan  National  Movement  (the
        BNM).  He claims that he is a member of this party,  has  delivered
        leaflets and posters, although notwithstanding the  fact  his  role
        was to spread information he was never caught by the authorities.


     4. SR claims, however, that on 8th August 2010 a First Incident Report
        (FIR) was issued accusing him of helping the party and "underground
        activities".  SR states he was not at home when the  Police  called
        for him and for the next five months from August 2010 he lived what
        he  describes  as  a  "peripatetic  and  clandestine  life"  whilst
        arrangements were made to smuggle  him  from  Pakistan.    He  left
        Pakistan on 21st January 2011 and travelled to Dubai from where  he
        flew to the United Kingdom.


     5. It is alleged the Pakistan government, the army,  the  police,  and
        the Secret Service, deal with Balochi separatists in a violent  way
        and  that  as  his  involvement  with  the  BNM  is  known  by  the
        authorities, and as a result of there being an outstanding FIR,  he
        will be killed if returned.


     6. Having considered the written and oral evidence the Judge sets  out
        his findings from paragraph  15  of  the  determination  which  are
        preserved.  The Judge noted the Secretary of State accepted that SR
        is Balochi and a national of Pakistan but did not accept his  party
        membership.


     7. The key findings can be summarised in the following terms:


              i.  SR is a young man from Balochistan  who  has  displayed  a
   significant                  knowledge of Balochistan separatist politics
   and the BNM [15(e)].


              ii. SR has provided consistent evidence that he is a young man
   from                 Balochistan  of  Pakistani   nationality   who   has
   demonstrated   a                           significant    knowledge    of
   Balochistan separatist politics.  The weight                 of  evidence
   indicates  that  he  has  an   interest   in   and   is   a   member   of
   BNM [15(g)].


              iii.     SR has failed to produce reliable evidence  that  the
   Pakistani                    authorities have an  interest  in  him.  The
   fulcrum of the claim is that if                returned  to  Pakistan  he
   will be arrested because  of  the  existence  of  an                  FIR
   issued  on  8  August   2010.   In   this   respect   SR   has   produced
   contradictory   evidence   which   cannot    be    relied    upon.    The
     unexplained difference of seven months in the date of the  FIR  creates
          a lack of consistency which indicates that I cannot place reliance
   on                  SR's evidence [15(n)].


              iv. Since arriving in  the  UK  SR  has  participated  in  one
   demonstration                promoting separatist  Balochistani  politics
   which took place in                       London towards the end of March
   2011 [15(o)].


              v.  There is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that SR has an
   interest in                  separatist politics.   There  is  sufficient
   evidence to demonstrate that                  SR is in all probability  a
   member of BNM.  There is neither reliable                   nor  credible
   evidence  to  indicate  that  SR   has   come   to   the   attention   of
   the Pakistani authorities [15 (p)].



Discussion



     8. It is asserted on SR's behalf that he will be returned to  Pakistan
        using an Emergency Travel Document and that on arrival he  will  be
        questioned about his activities and should not be expected  to  lie
        about who is and what he has been doing.  I accept that  SR  cannot
        be expected  to  deny  a  fundamental  belief  but  this  does  not
        automatically establish a real risk for him at the point of  return
        or thereafter.  There is  nothing  in  the  country  material  that
        supports a claim that a Balochi national who is a member of the BNM
        cannot return to Pakistan or will face a real risk  of  persecution
        or ill-treatment  at  the  airport.  Such  a  claim  has  not  been
        substantiated.


     9. SR will therefore be able to leave the airport as it has  not  been
        established that he will be  perceived  by  those  responsible  for
        processing  returnees  as  having  an  adverse  political   opinion
        contrary to the interests of the state of Pakistan.  He  is  not  a
        member of one of the named banned separatist groups referred to  in
        more detail below.


    10. The Minority Rights Group International recorded  in  its  Pakistan
        profile on the Baloch people, June 2009, that the  Baloch  are  the
        indigenous peoples  of  Baluchistan  which  is  split  between  the
        Pakistani province of Baluchistan and Iranian Baluchistan  although
        the majority of this ethnic group live in Pakistan.   The  Pakistan
        province of Baluchistan is said to be the largest of all  provinces
        of modern-day Pakistan making up nearly two fifths  of  the  entire
        country and with a population, according to a census  in  1998,  of
        6.5 million out of a total Pakistani  population  of  131  million.
        The population 2006 was estimated to be 8.2 million.


    11. I was specifically referred by Ms Patel to the  Country  of  Origin
        Information Report for Pakistan,  9th  August  2013,  and  selected
        entries therein, including:


         4.02     On 15 July 2013 the Human Rights  Commission  of  Pakistan
(HRCP)                     expressed  its  concern  at  the  steep  rise  in
killings in Karachi during the first                  six  months  of  2013.
The    statistics,    based    on    newspaper    reports,     cited     the
deaths of 1,726 people killed in sectarian violence, targeted  killings  and
              other incidences of violence. During the same period in  2012,
1,215 violent                   deaths were recorded. [27i]

    12. It is not disputed that some areas of Pakistan have  higher  levels
        of violence than others. Karachi is in Sindh province, one  of  the
        largest  cities  in  Pakistan,  and  the  figures  are  based  upon
        newspaper reports without differentiating the reasons for the  same
        or establishing a link to any risk to SR on  return.   Support  for
        such a proposition is to be found later in the report where  it  is
        stated:


          15.22 In its analysis of the security situation  in  Karachi,  BBC
   News                         reported on 8 July 2011:
              'Karachi is arguably one of South Asia's most violent  cities.
   It is not only                   the largest city and port  of  Pakistan,
   but also a major industrial and                    commercial centre.
              'The city is plagued by extortion rackets, land-grab mafia and
   armed                   groups fighting turf wars for their share of  its
   resources. The level of                       violence this week has  not
   been seen for years. Targeted killings and                       drive-by
   shootings  are   widely   blamed   on   armed   gangs   linked   to   the
   city's main political parties.
              There were always fears that with last week's resignation from
   the                     government by the city's main political  party  -
   the  MQM  [Muttahida                     Qaumi  Movement]   -   increased
   violence  and  instability   would   bring                     Pakistan's
   economic capital to a grinding halt.' [35i]


          15.23 The South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) reported in its South
   Asia                    Intelligence Review (SAIR), dated 11  July  2011:
   'The current spate of                     killings in Karachi principally
   resulted from clashes between MQM                      and PPP  [Pakistan
   People's       Party]       ally,       Awami       National        Party
   (ANP), drawing  a  line  of  blood  between  the  45  per  cent  of  Urdu
     speaking Mohajirs in the city,  on  whose  behalf  the  MQM  claims  to
          act; and the ANP, -representing| the city's 25  per  cent  Pashtun
              population. [The remaining  30  per  cent  comprise  Punjabis,
   Sindhis,                     Balochs, etc.]'


          15.24 The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) stated, in  its  April
   2012                         Country Report on Pakistan, that:
              'Much of the violence stems from  tensions  between  the  MQM,
   which                   derives most its support from the descendants  of
   generally Urdu- speaking                  Muslims who migrated from  what
   is now India after partition in  1947,  and                    the  Awami
   National     Party     (ANP),     which     represents     ethnic-Pashtun
   migrants. In recent years Karachi's precarious ethnic  balance  has  been
          affected by the arrival of tens of thousands of Pashtuns displaced
   by                      conflict  in  Pakistan's  Federally  Administered
   Tribal Areas (FATA),                      attracted  by  better  economic
   opportunities or forced  out  of  parts  of  the                  country
   affected by flooding in 2010-11.'


          15.25 The SATP's South Asia Intelligence Review dated 7  May  2012
                  commented on further violence in Karachi when the Security
   Forces                       (SF) commenced an  operation  in  the  Lyari
   area on 27  April  2012                      against  the  People's  Aman
   (Peace) Committee (PAC),  allegedly                           linked  to,
   and   supported   by,   the   Tehrik-e-Taliban   Pakistan    (TTP)    and
   Balochistan  Liberation  Army  (BLA).  By  the  5  May,  51  people   had
     been killed, including 26 civilians, 12 SF personnel and 13 criminals'.




          15.26 The USSD Report 2012 cited that:
              'On some university campuses  in  Karachi  and  Lahore,  armed
   groups                       of students, most commonly  associated  with
   the All Pakistan                          Mutahidda Students Organization
   (affiliated with the Muttahida                      Qaumi  Movement)  and
   the Islami Jamiat Talaba (affiliated with                       Jamaat-e-
   Islam)    clashed    with     and     intimidated     other     students,
   instructors, and administrators over issues such  as  language,  syllabus
          content,  examination  policies,  grades,  doctrines,  and  dress.
              These  groups  frequently  influenced  the  hiring  of  staff,
   admissions to                    universities, and sometimes the  use  of
   institutional  funds.  They                           generally  achieved
   such     influence     through     a     combination      of      protest
   rallies, control of campus  media,  and  threats  of  mass  violence.  In
          response university authorities prohibited political  activity  on
   many                    campuses, but the ban had limited effect.'


          15.27 On political violence elsewhere in  the  country,  the  HRCP
   Report                        2011  stated  that  targeted  killings   of
   several political  leaders  and                           activists  were
   reported    in     Balochistan.     In     Khyber     Pakhtunkhwa     and
   FATA,  political  leaders  and  activists  were  targeted  in   terrorist
              attacks, including suicide attacks and bombings.


    13. In relation to Balochistan itself the report states:


          Balochistan (Baluchistan)


          8.35    In its briefing on Pakistan violence, dated 11 April 2013,
   Reuters stated                   "Baluchistan lies to  the  southwest  of
   FATA [Federally Administered Tribal                Areas], bordering both
   Iran and Afghanistan, and is made up primarily of Baluch              and
   Pashtun ethnic groups. Baluch tribal militants are  fighting  a  decades-
   long           insurgency for greater political autonomy and control over
   local mineral                 resources.  Afghan  Taliban  fighters  also
   operate in the area, as do Pakistani               militant groups.'


          8.36    The HRW World Report 2013, covering 2012 events, observed:


              "The human rights crisis continued to worsen in  the  mineral-
   rich province of             Balochistan.  Human  Rights  Watch  recorded
   continued enforced disappearances             and killings  of  suspected
   Baloch militants and opposition activists by the                military,
   intelligence  agencies,  and  the  paramilitary  Frontier  Corps.  Baloch
     nationalists and other militant groups also stepped up attacks on  non-
   Baloch              civilians. Pakistan's military continued to  publicly
   resist government                     reconciliation efforts and attempts
   to   locate   ethnic   Baloch   who   had   been   subject             to
   -disappearances.| Pakistan's government appeared powerless to rein in the
              military's abuses.  As  a  result,  large  numbers  of  Hazara
   community members            sought asylum abroad.'


          8.37    The HRCP Report 2012 stated:


              "Balochistan has been considered the most volatile  region  in
   the  country  for               some  time  now  and  the  situation  has
   aggravated in recent years  due  to  the  rise  of                violent
   sectarian groups... According to media reports, 758 members of  the  Shia
     community have been killed from 2008 till 2012; of these, 338  belonged
   to the              Hazara community...
              The general law and order situation in  Balochistan  was  also
   far from secure as           8,201 crimes were reported in 2012. The main
   highways leading to Balochistan           were termed unsafe,  especially
   for night travel. The local business community              was adversely
   affected  since  delivery  of  raw  materials  or  products  was   rarely
   timely. A total of 261 people were murdered while 210  attempted  murders
   were           recorded in 2012 in Balochistan.'


          8.38    On 30 August 2012, the International Day of the Victims of
   Enforced                     Disappearances, Amnesty International stated
   in an open letter to the then Prime           Minister of Pakistan, Rajaz
   Pervez Ashraf, that:
               "Enforced  disappearances,  abductions   and   extra-judicial
   executions continue              with impunity at  an  alarming  rate  in
   Balochistan.  Reportedly,  hundreds  of                Baloch  activists,
   teachers, journalists  and  lawyers  have  been  abducted  or  killed  in
   the last two years alone. The bullet-ridden bodies  of  individuals,  who
   have been           forcibly disappeared or  abducted  and  many  bearing
   apparent marks of  torture,             are  found  across  the  province
   almost every day.
              "In many cases, victims' families  blame  these  incidents  on
   Pakistan's security              forces, especially  the  Frontier  Corps
   and intelligence services.  The  security  forces               deny  the
   charges and claim that the deaths are  a  result  of  tribal  differences
          between Baloch militant groups. However,  in  many  of  the  cases
   Amnesty                 International has documented,  the  victims  were
   last seen alive being led away by              uniformed  Frontier  Corps
   soldiers,   often   accompanied   by   men   in   plain    clothes,    in
   front of multiple witnesses at military  checkposts  and  in  cities  and
   towns.                  Regardless of determining  blame  for  these  and
   other killings in Balochistan, the            fact they continue unabated
   represents   one   of   the   greatest   failures   of    the    Pakistan
   state to protect the right to life.'


          8.39     The  HRCP  Report  2012  observed  'Mutilated  bodies  of
   suspected nationalists and            terrorists continue to  surface  in
   Balochistan. Official reports  said  that  125                  mutilated
   bodies were recovered till October 31, 2012 while unofficial  stats  were
     much higher than the official figures. The issue of missing persons  in
   Balochistan,             believed  to  be  in  the  custody  of  security
   establishment's intelligence agencies,             was taken  up  by  the
   Supreme Court in the year under review.'


          8.40     The  SATP  noted  in  its  Balochistan  Assessment  2013,
   covering 2012 events, that:           'With Sindh and  Gilgit  Baltistan,
   Balochistan is the only region in Pakistan which            has witnessed
   a rise in terrorism related fatalities in 2012.  The  Province  witnessed
     954 fatalities,  including  690  civilians,  178  Security  Force  (SF)
   personnel and 86             militants in 418  incidents  of  killing  in
   2012,  as  against  711  fatalities,   including   of                 542
   civilians, 122 SF personnel and 47 militants in 294 incidents of  killing
   in 2011,            according to partial data compiled by SATP. The first
   13 days of 2013 have                   already  recorded  144  fatalities
   [these numbers are likely to be underestimates, as              access to
   media and independent observers is severely restricted in Balochistan].'


          8.41    The SATP noted in its Balochistan  Assessment  2010,  that
   there were  '...at least  six               active  insurgent  groups  in
   Balochistan:  the  Balochistan  Liberation  Army  (BLA),              the
   Baloch Republican Army, the Baloch People's Liberation Front, the Popular
              Front for Armed Resistance, the Baloch Liberation Front  (BLF)
   and [the                Balochistan Liberation United Front]  BLUF.'  The
   same source added that the            BLUF was the  '...most  radical  of
   the three Baloch separatist groups even though it            isn't  clear
   if these are separate or overlapping factions operating  under  different
     names.'


          8.42    The HRCP Report 2010 observed:
              'The  federal  government  banned  five  Baloch  organisations
   including the Baloch             Liberation Army (BLA), Baloch Liberation
   Front  (BLF),  Baloch   Republican   Army             (BRA),   Lashkar-e-
   Balochistan    (LB)    and    Baloch    Musalla    Difa     Organization.
   Interior Minister Rheman Malik said the five organisations were  involved
   in             suicide attacks, rocket attacks and  killing  of  innocent
   people. He said no               organisation using the name of -army| or
   -lashkar| would be allowed to work            in  the  province  and  the
   security     forces     would     launch      targetted      operation[s]
   against them. He said the State Bank of Pakistan had been asked to freeze
   the             accounts  of  these  organisations.   Baloch   separatist
   organisations often did not           allow civil society outfits and non-
   Baloch    political    parties    to    freely    carry     out     their
   activities in the province.'


          8.43    The HRCP Report 2010 stated:
              'In Balochistan, militant insurgents continued to  target  the
   security forces and              non-Baloch residents  of  the  province.
   Non-Baloch teachers were murdered  in           targeted  killings.  Many
   teachers    were    reported    to    have     sought     transfer     to
   educational institutions in  Pashtun-majority  areas  of  Balochistan  or
   resigned and            migrated  to  other  provinces.  Baloch  militant
   organisations often claimed               responsibility  for  murder  of
   the academic staff and tried to justify their acts  as            revenge
   for the excesses committed by the  law  enforcing  agencies  against  the
     Baloch political activists.'


          8.44    The same report added:
               'In  September,  HRCP  expressed  serious  concern   at   the
   government's decision to              give policing powers in Balochistan
   to the  Frontier  Corps  (FC)  and  called  the               decision  a
   retrogressive step. It said that the FC did not have a good reputation in
              Balochistan and  demanded  a  reversal  of  the  decision  and
   political initiatives to              address the situation. As  many  as
   118 people were killed and 40 injured in 117           targeted  killings
   in  Balochistan  in  2010.  Those  killed  included  at  least  29   non-
   Baloch and 17 members of the Shia Hazara community.'


          8.45    BBC News reported on 24 November 2010 that,  according  to
   Balochistan's  chief                minister,   Sardar   Aslam   Raisani,
   'Pakistan's security agencies are involved in               extrajudicial
   killings in Balochistan.'  The  minister  claimed  that   '-Some  of  the
   abductions  and  killings  are  definitely  carried   out   by   security
   agencies...| He also             stressed that some of  the  deaths  were
   the responsibility of tribesmen  who  have            been  fighting  for
   greater   political   autonomy.'   The   BBC    added    'Human    rights
   organisations say kidnappings and murders of political dissidents are  at
   an all-             time high in the province.'


          8.46    The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) undertook a
   fact-finding            mission to Balochistan from the 15-19  May  2012.
   Its findings, including                    disappearances,  extrajudicial
   killings and killings by militants, were published in           the  HRCP
   report Hopes, fears and alienation in  Balochistan,  published  6  August
     2012. The report included a list of missing persons and missing persons
   found          dead.


          8.47    The SATP website  provides  a  comprehensive  timeline  of
   incidents in Balochistan              from 2003 through to  2013  in  its
   Balochistan Timeline, accessed 21 June 2013.
          8.48    Jane's reported in its Executive Summary, updated 19  June
   2013, that in an                 attempt to address  the  root  cause  of
   conflict,  a    'Balochistan   package'   (Aghaz-e-             Haqooq-i-
   Balochistan) was presented before parliament on 24 November 2009:
              'Key issues addressed  by  the  39-point-package  include  the
   acknowledgement              -that the question  of  provincial  autonomy
   needs to be revisited and the                 ownership of the  provinces
   over their resources reasserted in the constitution|             and  the
   determination -to correct  the  wrongs  of  history,  by  conferring  the
     political, economic and cultural rights  of  the  provinces|.  Specific
   proposals            comprise  far-reaching  constitutional,   political,
   administrative and economic           measures... The chances of positive
   movement on the Baloch insurgency have             increased as a  result
   of  the  2013  election,  with   Baloch   nationalist   parties   running
   and the central government deciding to appoint a nationalist, Abdul Malik
                  Baloch, as chief minister. Less promising is any  movement
   to dissuade the                   Lashkar-e-Jhangvi  from  targeting  the
   province's Hazara minority, who were the           victims of a series of
   devastating attacks in 2012-13.'


          8.49    The SATP's Balochistan Assessment  2013  stated  that  the
   Aghaz-e-Haqooq-i-            Balochistan (Initiation  of  the  rights  of
   Balochistan) package, approved by                  Pakistan's  Parliament
   in 2009 had failed to deliver. SATP noted:
              'Though Parliamentary Secretary  Khurram  Jahangir  Watto,  on
   October 5, 2012,             claimed that 42 of its 61 points had already
   been implemented, there has, in fact,              been  little  progress
   on  the  issue  of  provincial   autonomy,   which   according   to   the
   package, should have been immediately addressed. Though  a  parliamentary
     committee to look into  the  proposals  and  recommendations  regarding
   provincial              autonomy has been formed, the committee is yet to
   reach to any conclusion.              Similarly, the  proposal  regarding
   initiation of a political dialogue with all major            stakeholders
   in the political spectrum, to bring them into  the  mainstream  politics,
     has not been met, as Government failed to inspire trust in  the  Baloch
   nationalist              groups.  The  Government  is  yet   to   release
   political prisoners, another proposal in           the package.  While  a
   range   of   financial   elements    in    the    package    have    been
   announced, implementation on the ground remains, at best, marginal.'


    14. SR's party, the BMN, is not referred to as one of the groups banned
        by the government even though I  accept  the  party  is  active  in
        Balochistan.  SR relies on a number of articles such as that to  be
        found at page 37 of his bundle dated 31 December 2012 criticising a
        military offensive and referring to a statement from the BMN.  This
        article does  not  support  a  claim  the  party  are  specifically
        targeted or at risk, per se, from the authorities  in  Pakistan  or
        any of its agencies.


    15. I have also considered in detail the parts of section 9 of the COIR
        to which  I  have  been  referred  by  Ms  Patel  relating  to  the
        activities of the security services.


    16. In assessing risk it is of course necessary to consider such issues
        through the eyes of any potential persecutor  and  so  whilst  SR's
        party may not be a banned party in Pakistan, and  may  not  contain
        anything within its name which is  prohibited  by  the  authorities
        (such as the word 'army'), and may not suffer the  same  degree  of
        suppression as other groups, it is how he will be perceived  if  he
        comes into contact with  the  authorities  that  is  the  important
        element to be considered.


    17. I have considered all the country information I have been asked  to
        consider,  the  letter  of  submissions  from  Howell  &  Co,  SR's
        solicitors  dated  22  March  2011,  and  the  subjective   witness
        statements, as requested by Ms Patel. I also take into account  the
        fact that SR attended a demonstration whilst in the United  Kingdom
        and attended some meetings of his party which he  claims  will  put
        him at risk upon return too.


    18. The assessment of risk has to be undertaken also  by  reference  to
        the fact SR has no adverse political profile as his claim to be the
        subject of adverse interest by the authorities or at risk of arrest
        as a result  of  a  FIR  having  been  issued  was  found  to  lack
        credibility. There is no evidence that he has ever been detained by
        the authorities, photographed, fingerprinted, or interviewed and he
        is not a member of a banned violent separatist party.


    19. SR's account  of  posting  leaflets  and  putting  up  posters  was
        rejected by the Judge as his evidence could not  be  believed.   He
        has attended occasional meetings in the  United  Kingdom  but  this
        does not indicate an individual with any form  of  adverse  profile
        and  particularly  the  profile  of  an  activist  threatening  the
        interests of the government per se. I accept he has been  found  to
        have a level of knowledge indicative  of  a  person  interested  in
        separatist politics and to be a member of the BMN.   Mrs  Rackstraw
        submitted that there could be a greater risk for a  person  with  a
        higher profile, a  human  rights  activist,  teachers,  lawyers  or
        academic, but to claim that all would be at risk in a population of
        8.2 million is speculation. I find merit in such an argument.


    20. I find that the material  relating  to  extrajudicial  killings  in
        Pakistan, which I accept are a feature of the  activities  of  some
        security forces in the country, does not indicate  a  risk  to  all
        members of the community in all of that country.


    21. I also find there is no evidence that any member of his family  has
        been pursued or is of interest to the  authorities  in  Baluchistan
        where they are said to live, even though SR claims they are,  which
        is contrary to the preserved finding.


    22. I accept SR has been involved in activities in the  United  Kingdom
        but do not find he has substantiated his claim that such activities
        will have come to the attention of the Pakistani authorities or, if
        they had, that they create a real risk  for  him  on  return  as  a
        result of the group he is a member of and in light of the low level
        of such activities.  Despite  extensive  country  information  SR's
        claim the BNM are targeted by the law-enforcement agencies  to  the
        extent that creates a real risk is not substantiated.


    23. I find the situation in Pakistan can be  violent  in  a  number  of
        areas, which is the same for all members of the population in those
        areas, but that there are also other areas where there is  evidence
        of less acts of violence and little evidence of interest in Balochi
        issues.


    24. I find having considered the  evidence  with  the  degree  of  care
        required in an appeal of this nature,  that  of  anxious  scrutiny,
        that SR has failed to substantiate his claim to be at risk  at  the
        point of return.  As there is no evidence to the contrary I find he
        has not substantiated his claim that he cannot return to  his  home
        area as his claim to be of interest to the authorities as a  result
        of previous activities was found not  to  be  credible.   There  is
        insufficient evidence to support the claim that if SR  resumed  his
        level of activities that he has undertaken in  the  United  Kingdom
        with the BNM he will face a real risk although I accept that if  he
        increased the level of his activities or was perceived as  being  a
        separatist threatening the interests of the state, elements of  the
        security services rather than the government of Pakistan itself  as
        a matter of policy, may take an adverse interest in him.  If so the
        country material indicates  that  there  is  a  real  risk  of  ill
        treatment sufficient to breach Article 3  or  entitle  him  to  the
        protection of the Refugee  Convention  although  this  is  not  the
        situation that exists at the date of this hearing.


    25. In any event, even if SR cannot return to his home area  I  do  not
        find he has substantiated his claim that it is unreasonable in  all
        the circumstances to expect him to internally relocate  to  another
        part of Pakistan.  The country material  does  not  substantiate  a
        claim there is a real risk from the authorities in all parts of the
        country and the only information  I  was  referred  to  relates  to
        levels of violence in Karachi with nothing to indicate SR could not
        relocate to Islamabad,  which  will  be  the  point  of  return  on
        removal.  He is a young man with no health issues, has worked as  a
        mechanic in the past, and it is not suggested that he will  not  be
        able to re-establish himself in his home state.  I  therefore  find
        that if required there is an internal  flight  alternative  (as  an
        alternative finding) although my primary finding  is  that  on  the
        basis of the  material  available  to  this  Tribunal  SR  has  not
        substantiated his claim that he is at risk on return  of  suffering
        ill treatment sufficient to entitle him to a grant of international
        protection.


Decision

    26. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has been  found  to  have  materially
        erred in law  and  his  determination  set  aside.   I  remake  the
        decision as follows. This appeal is dismissed.






   Anonymity.


    27. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make such an order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
