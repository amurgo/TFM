                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The  Appellant  born  on  27th  February  1978  is  a  citizen  of  the
    Philippines.  The Appellant had made application on 18th  October  2013
    to remain in the United Kingdom as the  spouse  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Respondent had refused the Appellant's application in  part
    on 28th November 2013 but indicated that an application had been placed
    on hold until the outcome of an appeal case had been heard.  Thereafter
    that application had been refused.

 2. The Appellant had appealed that decision and her appeal  was  heard  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Napthine at Hatton  Cross  on  12th  February
    2015.  The judge allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Respondent had appealed that decision  by  application  dated  18th
    March 2015 essentially on the basis that the judge had erred in  taking
    account post-application material.  Permission to appeal was granted by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett on 6th May 2015 finding  the  matter
    was arguable.  Directions were issued for the Upper Tribunal to firstly
    decide whether an error of law had been made by the First-tier Tribunal
    or  not.   The  matter  comes  before  me  in  accordance  with   those
    directions.

Submissions

 4. It was agreed by the representatives  at  the  outset  that  given  the
    strict requirements of Appendix FM-SE an error of law had been made  by
    the judge in considering material that postdated the  application  date
    in this case, which was 18th October 2013.

 5. This is one of a not insignificant number of cases that  suffered  from
    delay as a consequence of two unfortunate circumstances.  Following the
    original decision in MM the Home  Office  had,  rather  than  making  a
    decision upon financial threshold requirements, adjourned  their  final
    decision to await the outcome of the Secretary of  State  to  challenge
    that original case in MM.  The need to so  do  was  a  moot  point  and
    perhaps unsurprisingly the original decision in MM  was  overturned  by
    the Court of Appeal.  The delay in this case was of  less  significance
    than in many other cases given that the Appellant was lawfully  in  the
    UK with her spouse rather than applying from abroad and being separated
    from her spouse.

 6. The error of law is not one that is open to remedy simply  by  remaking
    this decision.  However Mr Tarlow accepted that the facts of this  case
    as found by the judge, and not challenged by the Home Office, disclosed
    that since the application date given the length of delay  the  Sponsor
    had produced credible evidence and  documentary  evidence  to  disclose
    that at the date of hearing the Sponsor had  documentary  evidence  for
    two years of self-employment disclosing annual income  of  ï¿½21,000  and
    therefore above the income threshold needed.

 7. Mr Tarlow's decision therefore that the matter should now  be  remitted
    back to the Home Office, for  them  to  consider  the  case  fully  and
    exercise discretion is a proper and equitable  manner  of  disposal  of
    this case that was agreed upon by Mr Coleman of Counsel.

 8. It is agreed that the lack of challenge to the income  level  now,  the
    credibility of  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  and  the  reliability  of
    documents submitted all  found  by  the  judge  within  the  First-tier
    Tribunal would tend to suggest the result of such an examination now by
    the Home Office although that is a matter of course for them.

Notice of Decision

 9. I find a material error of law was made by the judge and set aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  by  agreement  will  now  be
    remitted back to the Home Office for them to exercise their  discretion
    in this case.

10. Anonymity direction not made.
