Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mayiran Vigneswaran, date of birth 6.9.92, is a  citizen
    of Sri Lanka.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Eban  promulgated  5.9.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of  the  respondent,  dated  24.4.14  to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims made on  18.10.13,  and
    to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 15.8.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid granted permission to appeal on 2.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.11.4 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Eban should be set aside.

 6. In essence, the grounds of appeal submit that:

      a) the judge erred in law in concluding that the appellant  would  not
         be at risk on return and that her conclusions were not supported by
         GJ or her own findings of fact;

      b) the judge erred in failing to consider how the appellant  would  be
         viewed in light of his sur place activities;

      c) the judge failed to give  sufficient  weight  to  the  medical  and
         psychiatric reports in  support  of  the  appellant's  account,  in
         respect  of  which  the  judge's  approach  and  conclusions   were
         procedurally unfair;

      d) the appeal should have been allowed under 339K.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Reid found "it is arguable that
    the judge's conclusions on risk on return  are  inconsistent  with  her
    findings of fact in relation to past treatment and sur place activities
    with reference to country guidance case law. The  grounds  disclose  an
    arguable error of law."

 8. The Rule 24 response,  dated  13.10.14,  submits  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge directed herself appropriately and was entitled to  make
    the findings of fact set out in the determination. "The judge took into
    account the  appellant's  claimed  activities  in  Sri  Lanka,  medical
    evidence and activities in the UK  i.e.  attending  demonstrations  and
    found that the appellant would not be at risk on return to  Sri  Lanka.
    The judge  has  properly  considered  GJ  and  Others  (post-civil  war
    returnees) [2013] UKUT 00310 (IAC), and applied it  to  the  particular
    facts of the case."

 9. The paragraph numbering and  layout  of  the  determination  is  rather
    confusing. However, at �9 the judge set out those facts accepted by the
    respondent. At �27 the judge made additional findings,  continuing  the
    findings numbering from those in �9.

10. It is clear that in �23 and �28 the judge made several errors as to the
    dates of detention. The appellant was first detained in February  2009,
    released in October 2009. Thereafter, he was detained  for  a  week  in
    February 2011 during which time he was beaten. The judge  accepted  the
    June 2011 detention, which had been rejected  by  the  respondent,  but
    rejected the claim to have been targeted again in November 2012  during
    which he claims to have been tortured and burned so  badly  that  scars
    remain. The reasons for that conclusion are set out in  detail  in  �24
    and the following several sub-paragraphs. As part of those reasons  the
    judge considered that it is  reasonably  likely  that  the  authorities
    would have discovered all there was to know about the appellant and his
    LTTE involvement by the end  of  his  June  2011  detention.  In  those
    circumstances, and in light of the fact that the area where he was  had
    been previously controlled by the LTTE that he  had  trained  with  the
    LTTE, The judge considered at �24(9) that it was not reasonably  likely
    that a 'tip-off' in November 2012 would have been of  any  interest  to
    the authorities. Also considered was the medical evidence, but  at  �25
    the judge gave reasons for attaching limited weight to the  report.  As
    the Court of Appeal recently stated in MN (Sri Lanka) [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    1601,

         "Detention and  torture  by  the  army  in  the  circumstances  the
         appellant had described was one possibility, but there were others;
         for example, he could have been the victim of an attack  by  people
         who had a grudge against him, or he could have  been  detained  and
         tortured by the authorities under  circumstances  and  for  reasons
         other than those he described, or his injuries could even have been
         inflicted with his consent to improve his claim for asylum. It  was
         impossible to say when the injuries  were  inflicted  and  his  own
         account  of  the  circumstances  in  which  he  received  them  was
         unsatisfactory in a number of significant respects. It is unfair to
         say that the tribunal rejected the claim of torture because it  did
         not fit the view it had  taken  independently  of  the  appellant's
         credibility; it was  simply  not  persuaded  that  the  appellant's
         injuries had been inflicted  by  the  authorities  in  the  way  he
         described. In my view it is not possible to say that the First-tier
         Tribunal was perverse or that it erred in law in not accepting  the
         claimant's account as reliable."

11. To succeed on the basis of failure to accord sufficient weight  to  the
    medical injuries the appellant would  have  to  demonstrate  that  they
    admitted of only one conclusion, namely, that the  appellant's  account
    was true, and that it was perverse on the part of the judge not to have
    made a finding to that effect. I  find  the  judge  gave  adequate  and
    cogent reason for the limited weight to  be  accorded  to  the  medical
    evidence in assessing whether  the  2012  detention  and  torture  took
    place.

12. The grounds complain that there was no reference to Dr Goldwyn's report
    (A9). However, the judge stated at  �23  that  the  evidence  had  been
    considered as a whole,  including  the  medical  evidence.  The  report
    itself limits its own utility. At �O of the opinion section, the doctor
    points out that he is not a psychiatrist but  only  has  experience  in
    examining patients who have claimed to be tortured. In that light,  his
    opinion that it is extremely difficult to feign  a  "full-blown  mental
    illness convincing experienced clinicians," can carry  limited  weight.
    It is also worth noting that the appellant was able to give details  of
    the burns in July 2013 but a few months later  in  September  2013  was
    unable to recall the causation.

13. In summary, the judge concluded that the appellant  has  had  low-level
    LTTE involvement, was detained  and  mistreated  during  detentions  in
    2011, but was of no further interest to the authorities in Sri Lanka.

14. Further, the judge did not accept, for the  reasons  stated,  that  the
    appellant had any significant role in diaspora activities  designed  to
    destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state or revive the  internal  armed
    conflict.  His  own  case  was  that  he  had  attended  two   peaceful
    demonstrations in the UK, only  one  of  which  was  organised  by  the
    British Tamil Forum; the other was a Trade Unionist  and  Social  Union
    demonstration outside Downing Street.

15. The judge noted that at �336 of GJ, the Tribunal found that  attendance
    as demonstrations in the diaspora alone was not sufficient to create  a
    real risk or a reasonable degree  of  likelihood  that  a  person  will
    attract adverse attention  on  return  to  Sri  Lanka.    At  �351  the
    Tribunal found that the Sri  Lankan  authorities  had  the  ability  to
    distinguish those who are actively involved in seeking  to  revive  the
    separatist movement or destabilise the unitary  state.  "Attendance  at
    one, or even several demonstrations in the diaspora is  not  of  itself
    evidence that a person is a committed Tamil activist seeking to promote
    Tamil separatism within Sri Lanka. That will be a question of  fact  in
    each case, dependent on any diaspora activities carried out by such  an
    individual."

16. When considering  at  �27,  �28,  and  thereafter,  what  interest  the
    authorities might have in the appellant today, the judge concluded that
    the Sri Lankan authorities would know, because  of  their  intelligence
    capability,  that  he  was  not  an  activist  or  organiser  of   such
    demonstrations and not involved in separatist activities.  At  �29  the
    judge concluded that the authorities would not  now  regard  him  as  a
    threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a  single  state,  or  that  he
    would be perceived as having  any  significant  role  in  post-conflict
    Tamil separatism in the  diaspora  or  an  interest  in  a  renewal  of
    hostilities in Sri Lanka. There was thus no real risk of being  stopped
    and questioned at the airport or thereafter in the community.

17. In relation to the article 3 medical claim, the grounds submit that  on
    her own findings and in light of �450-456 of GJ, the judge should  have
    allowed the appeal. There the Tribunal cited  the  case  of  J  v  SSHD
    [2005] EWCA Civ 629, which  test  the  judge  adopted  at  �40  of  the
    decision. The treatment of the article 3 claims began  at  �31  of  the
    decision.  The  judge  considered  the  threshold  required   and   the
    difference in treatment that might be available in Sri Lanka. The judge
    went on to consider the real risk of suicide, noting Dr Lawrence's view
    that the  appellant  is  not  at  current  risk  but  that  risk  would
    definitely be increased if he were returned to Sri Lanka.  As  part  of
    this assessment, at �40(5) the judge found that the appellant's account
    of how he came to have burns on his body was not credible in the  light
    of the background evidence and also concluded that his  fears,  whether
    or not genuine, were not well-founded. However, the  judge  effectively
    distinguished the case of the third appellant in  GJ,  whose  condition
    was very severely mentally ill, too ill in fact to give  evidence,  and
    having clear plans to commit suicide if returned, so that in  his  case
    alone the Tribunal in GJ allowed his appeal on article 3, based on  the
    severity of the  illness.  As  the  judge  explained  at  �41-43,  this
    appellant's case is not comparable and not so severe as to amount to  a
    breach of article 3 on the basis of the risk of  suicide.  I  find  the
    First-tier Tribunal's analysis carefully made, with  cogent  and  clear
    reasons, such as to disclose no error of law in this regard. The appeal
    on this ground could only succeed if  it  could  be  demonstrated  that
    there was only one conclusion that could  be  drawn  from  the  medical
    evidence, whether that of Dr Lawrence, Dr Goldwyn, or on the  basis  of
    the facts accepted by the judge generally, could it be  said  that  the
    decision was perverse.

18. The grounds also make the same argument in MN (Sri Lanka), in  relation
    to which the Court of Appeal said:

         "The matter does not end there, however, because of the  tribunal's
         finding that even if the appellant's account were accepted at  face
         value and he had been detained and  tortured  by  the  army  as  he
         described, he would no longer be of interest to the authorities  if
         he were to return to Sri Lanka. The basis of the finding appears to
         be that, following the suppression of the  LTTE,  the  authorities'
         attention is now directed only to those elements of the  population
         and members of the Sri Lankan diaspora who are thought  to  have  a
         desire and an ability to undermine the regime.  There  was  nothing
         about the appellant's activities,  either  in  Sri  Lanka  or  this
         country, which suggested that he might fall into that category.

         Ms Jegarajah submitted that, if the appellant had at one time  been
         of sufficient interest  to  the  authorities  to  be  detained  and
         tortured and had obtained his freedom by bribery  before  the  army
         had chosen to release him, the authorities had not exhausted  their
         interest in him and  he  therefore  remained  at  risk  on  return.
         Whether that is so or not, however, is a question of fact, on which
         the tribunal was entitled to reach its own conclusion based on  the
         evidence before it. Ms Jegarajah accepted  that  the  tribunal  had
         correctly applied the country guidance as it stood at the  date  of
         its decision and in my view the  finding  that  the  appellant  was
         unlikely to be of any further interest to the authorities  was  one
         which it was entitled to make in the light of the  evidence  before
         it. If, therefore, the First-tier Tribunal did make an error of law
         in failing to accept the appellant's account, it was immaterial  to
         the outcome of the appeal.

19. I am satisfied that the judge correctly applied  GJ  and  has  properly
    considered all material evidence, reaching conclusions that  were  open
    to her, to the effect that  notwithstanding  his  past  detentions  and
    mistreatment in 2009 and 2011, there is  no  real  likelihood  that  he
    would be of any further interest to the Sri Lankan authorities. It  was
    a conclusion to which the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  was  entitled  to
    come in the light of the evidence before her. If there is any error  of
    law in failing to specifically draw attention to Dr  Goldwyn's  report,
    in the light of the other sustainable findings, it was not material  to
    the outcome of the appeal.

20. In the main the grounds of appeal  are  no  more  than  an  attempt  to
    reargue the appeal and an attempt to pick apart the decision  piece  by
    piece. When considered as  a  whole  it  is  abundantly  clear  on  the
    evidence that the appellant was at best a low-level LTTE member who was
    detained, interrogated and mistreated in the past, but  of  no  further
    interest to the authorities. As the judge put  it  at  �11,  "there  is
    absolutely nothing in the appellant's evidence that would suggest  that
    after two or on his evidence three  detentions  the  authorities  could
    have expected to get any more information from a twenty year old  young
    person, who was a teenager during even the final stages  of  the  ward,
    than they had already obtained after holding him and beating him."

21. On the findings of the judge, there is no  reason  why  this  appellant
    would come to the adverse attention of the authorities in the future if
    returned to Sri Lanka. He does not represent a  risk  of  destabilising
    the unitary government or likely to ferment Tamil separatist  activity.
    He has not engaged in any diaspora behaviour likely to create any  risk
    profile.

Conclusions:

22. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                           I do not set aside the decision.

                      The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and
                      the appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award
