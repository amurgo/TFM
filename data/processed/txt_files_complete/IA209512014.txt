                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. This appeal by the Secretary of State came before us on 26  June  2015.
    The Secretary of State's grounds are, in essence, that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, Judge J Grant-Hutchison, failed  to  properly  complete
    consideration  of  the  issues  she   had   identified   as   requiring
    determination.  The parties agreed, subject to what is set  out  below,
    that the appropriate remedy  is  for  us  to  set  aside  Judge  Grant-
    Hutchison's decision and remit the appeal to her to re-determine it  in
    accordance with the law.

 2.  Mr  Bryce  raised  a  further  issue.   The  respondent  Ms  O'Hearn's
    immigration  status  may  be  a  matter  for  discussion.    Subsequent
    exchanges between the parties indicate that  following  an  application
    for the conditions of her  leave  (as  a  work  permit  holder)  to  be
    modified, she was sent a letter with the requested modification and  an
    indication that her leave as modified now expired on 1  May  2013,  and
    was given back her passport clearly indicating a grant of  leave  until
    16 February 2014.  She made an application for extension of  her  leave
    between those dates.  If  the  vignette  in  the  passport  (which  the
    Secretary of State could have modified or replaced  but  did  not,  and
    which, unlike the letter, is a document of identity and  status)  takes
    precedence, the application has never been properly determined.

 3. The parties still hope to resolve the issue set  out  in  the  previous
    paragraph but in the mean time the appropriate decision for us to  make
    is that set out in paragraph 1.  In relation  to  Ms  O'Hearn's  appeal
    against the refusal of a Residence Card we set aside the  determination
    of Judge J Grant-Hutchison, remit the appeal to her and direct that she
    re-determine it according to law.


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                        Date: 25 August 2015
