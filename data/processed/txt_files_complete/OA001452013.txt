                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is an appeal against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    promulgated on 14 November 2013 whereby the Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    refusal to grant entry clearance to  Mrs  Abubeker  to  settle  as  the
    spouse of the sponsor, Mr Yassin Idris was upheld.  The application was
    refused under paragraph 352A of HC 395 as amended.

 2. The appellant is a national of Eritrea.  Her case is that  she  married
    Mr Idris in Eritrea on 1 August 2003.  She was then  aged  14  and  the
    sponsor was aged 18.  The sponsor left Eritrea in July 2006 and did not
    regain contact with the appellant on their case  until  2007  by  which
    time he was in the United Kingdom.  He was granted some sort of refugee
    status in 2007 but not indefinite leave to remain until  January  2013.
    The parties have claimed that there was subsequent contact  by  e-mail,
    telephone and Skype.

 3. In 2012 the appellant fled to Sudan and on 6 May 2012  she  was  issued
    with  a  refugee  card.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused   the
    application under paragraph 352A(i) and (iv).  As for sub-paragraph (i)
    the requirement that the  parties  were  married  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied about a marriage certificate which  had  been
    provided because it was in Arabic and  "not  in  the  usual  format  or
    language".  As for sub-paragraph (iv) the requirement that the  parties
    intended to live permanently with each other as spouses  and  that  the
    marriage was subsisting, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  concerned
    about the absence of evidence of contact, in particular evidence  which
    predated the decision which was on 11 November 2012.

 4. On appeal the First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from the  sponsor  and
    received a witness statement from the appellant.  We will focus on  the
    matters in issue but return to  them  when  analysing  the  grounds  of
    appeal which have been advanced.

 5. The sponsor's evidence was that  the  marriage  took  place  in  Keren,
    Eritrea on 1 August 2003.  The respective families were present and two
    witnesses signed the marriage certificate.  According to paragraph 4 of
    his witness statement "we did have a lot of pictures of our wedding but
    because I had to escape and my wife also had to escape Eritrea  we  did
    not prioritise taking our wedding pictures with us".  According to  his
    oral evidence there were no pictures of the wedding.  It emerged  under
    re-examination that what the sponsor meant by that was that no pictures
    were taken at the mosque where the  religious  ceremony  was  held  but
    pictures were taken at the  house  afterwards.   As  for  the  marriage
    certificate the sponsor explained that this was issued by the court and
    not by the mosque and that Arabic is one of the national  languages  of
    Eritrea.  That point was not put in issue  by  those  representing  the
    Entry Clearance Officer at the appeal.

 6. The sponsor was cross-examined on the basis  that  the  dowry  was  not
    mentioned in the marriage certificate.  He had  given  the  appellant's
    family the equivalent of �4,000 so that items  of  jewellery  could  be
    fashioned out of gold.  His explanation for the absence of reference to
    the amount of money in the marriage certificate was  that  dowries  are
    part of Eritrean tradition.

 7. The sponsor also confirmed in evidence that  at  his  asylum  screening
    interview in 2008 he had mentioned the existence of his wife.   As  for
    contact between the parties the sponsor  stated  that  this  had  taken
    place by phone and e-mail but that  they  were  now  using  Skype.   It
    appears from the appellant's witness statement that the  use  of  Skype
    started in 2013.

 8. It is clear from the determination of the First-tier Tribunal that only
    two e-mails were produced.  These were dated 16 June and 26 June  2012.
    The explanation for the failure to produce earlier e-mails was that the
    sponsor's e-mail account was locked and he had forgotten his  password.
    The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the  appeal  largely  on  credibility
    grounds, in other words the First-tier Tribunal rejected the assertions
    made in evidence by the sponsor and by the  appellant  in  her  witness
    statement.   We now list the adverse credibility points which the First-
    tier Tribunal made under paragraph 352A(i).

           . First, at the screening interview in 2008,  the  sponsor  said
             that the marriage  was  "registered  in  mosque"  whereas  the
             certificate shows that it was registered  at  the  Keren  Shia
             Court on 5 August 2003.

           . Secondly, the sponsor stated twice in  cross-examination  that
             no pictures were taken of the wedding and it was only  in  re-
             examination that he clarified that by this he  meant  that  no
             pictures were taken at the mosque.

           . Thirdly, the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  concerned  about  the
             circumstances in which the marriage certificate was  obtained,
             the failure to obtain wedding pictures at the same time and as
             to the delay in the making of  this  application.   All  these
             points are collected under paragraph 40 of the  determination.



           . Fourthly, the First-tier  Tribunal  was  concerned  about  the
             evidence relating to the dowry which she said  was  vague  and
             untruthful.  At one point the  sponsor  was  saying  that  "we
             made" in other words the family made  some  jewellery  out  of
             gold they had obtained.  At another point he was  saying  that
             they gave the equivalent of �4,000 to the  appellant's  family
             to purchase the gold.  Under Islamic custom, at least in  this
             region, it was compulsory to give the gift  or  dowry  to  the
             wife.

           . Fifthly, the point was taken that the marriage certificate did
             not mention a dowry, and

           . Sixthly the point was taken that there was  no  evidence  from
             the mosque.

 9. As for the finding under paragraph 352A(iv) of HC 395 there  were  four
    points made:

           .  First the First-tier Tribunal gave weight as she  put  it  to
             the lack of satisfactory evidence of any contact  between  the
             parties after the sponsor left Eritrea in July  2006  and  his
             arrival in the United Kingdom.

           . Secondly, the First-tier Tribunal interpreted the two  e-mails
             dated June 2012 as indicative only of the  appellant's  desire
             to leave Sudan rather than of a subsisting marriage.

           . Thirdly, "all the  evidence  of  contact  that  is  before  me
             postdates the refusal decision" and

           . the First-tier Tribunal could not understand why  the  sponsor
             did not open another e-mail account  or  download  earlier  e-
             mails by, for example going to an internet  caf�  or  using  a
             different computer.

10. The First-tier Tribunal also dismissed the claim under Article A but in
    the circumstances the fate of that claim wholly depended on  the  claim
    under the Rules.

11. Various grounds of appeal were advanced in writing  and  permission  to
    appeal was on our understanding granted  on  an  unlimited  basis.   We
    propose to examine the grounds in the order in which they were advanced
    before us today  by  Ms  Themistocleous  but  we  will  adopt  our  own
    numbering.

12. The first point is that the apparent discrepancy regarding the marriage
    and the marriage certificate was not one which was put to  the  sponsor
    to deal with in cross-examination.  The discrepancy was dealt  with  by
    the First-tier Tribunal at paragraphs 43 and 44 of the determination in
    particular and we have already covered it.  On the one hand the sponsor
    had been saying at  his  screening  interview  that  the  marriage  was
    registered at the mosque, on the other hand the  document  showed  that
    the marriage was registered at the Keren Shia Court on 5  August  2003.
    Paragraph 4 of the witness statement provided for the purposes  of  the
    appeal  stated  in  terms  that  two  witnesses  signed  the   marriage
    certificate which is not consistent with the registration and the Keren
    Shia Court.

13. The real point which is being made  by  the  appellant  is  that  these
    matters were not put to  the  sponsor  in  cross-examination  and  only
    emerged very late in the day during  the  course  of  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer's closing address.  Indeed the point which the Entry
    Clearance Officer had made, namely that the marriage certificate was in
    as it were the wrong language, namely Arabic, had almost fallen away by
    that stage and in any event was a point which did not find favour  with
    the First-tier Tribunal for very good reason.  The difficulty with this
    submission is that the discrepancy issue was one which  emerged  before
    the proceedings concluded and the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  rose  to
    prepare her determination.  It had been flagged up  in  the  course  of
    submissions yet no point was taken by the appellant as to lateness  and
    no application for an adjournment was made.  The points as it were were
    forensic points which could be taken on the face of the  documents  and
    were there for the First-tier Tribunal to analyse if she  thought  fit.
    Presentationally, in our view, although it does  seem  slightly  harsh,
    these were points which could and should have been addressed during the
    course of further submissions and it is now too  late  to  complain  on
    fairness grounds that these points were taken against the appellant.

14. It appeared to us that some sort of  irrationality  argument  was  also
    being founded in relation to the certificates but in our  judgment  the
    submissions made fall a long way short of establishing perversity.   It
    may be that the weight to be placed on these discrepancies was somewhat
    harsh, at least as regards the appellant's prospective  but  points  or
    matters of weight are not for this Tribunal, they are  for  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and the First-tier Tribunal were  certainly  entitled  to
    reach the conclusions that were reached, in particular at paragraphs 43
    and 44 so we reject that ground of appeal.

15. The second ground of appeal at least on our numbering in terms  of  the
    point advanced to us today orally was that the fact that the dowry  was
    not mentioned in the marriage certificate or at least  its  amount  was
    not a point which was raised clearly during the course of the  hearing.
    Again really the same repost can be made to this point, it was a  point
    which came out during the course of submissions  on  our  understanding
    and it is a point which therefore fell to be addressed  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and indeed by  submissions  advanced  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant if so advised.  This appears to us to be frankly  less  harsh
    than the previous point that dowries in Islamic law are very  important
    issues and one would expect the fact and the amount of the dowry to  be
    recorded in the certificate.  So it is not as if paragraph  45  of  the
    determination is proceeding on a frolic of its own, it proceeds on  the
    basis of a reasonably solid evidential premise.  We reject that limb of
    the second grounds.

16. There was a second limb of the second ground which related to  who  was
    providing the money.  On the one  hand  there  was  evidence  that  the
    family provided the money  to  the  appellant's  side  as  it  were  to
    purchase or make jewellery, on the other hand the  sponsor  was  saying
    "we make jewellery in gold.  I have the jewellery made".  So there  was
    a discrepancy there.  It is true that that discrepancy could have  been
    reconciled  on  the  basis  that  there  was  a  cultural   issue   and
    misunderstanding which arose in all the circumstances.  At the  end  of
    the day there was not in fact a discrepancy between what was being said
    at different times but  the  difficulty  here,  as  with  previous  and
    frankly with future grounds of appeal, these were matters  of  fact  of
    weight of emphasis for the First-tier Tribunal to  make  the  most  of,
    they are not points which can properly be taken  on  appeal  unless  we
    were to decide that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  reached  an  irrational
    conclusion.  We cannot come to that conclusion on this  aspect  of  the
    case although we do have some sympathy with the appellant's position in
    relation to that aspect of the appeal.

17. A similar point can be made in relation to the photographs which is the
    third issue on my numbering which was advanced before  us  today.   The
    First-tier Tribunal took against the appellant's evidence  in  relation
    to the photographs because it was not  consistent  evidence.   He  said
    twice in cross-examination that they  did  not  take  pictures  of  the
    wedding which on our understanding relates  to  what  happened  at  the
    mosque and then he said in re-examination that  the  picture  had  been
    taken at the house afterwards.  Now it may well be in line with Islamic
    custom and law that you cannot take photographs in a mosque since  that
    would be a gross violation of Sharia law.  That is not  quite  the  way
    that the matter was advanced below but if one takes that  into  account
    it is quite understandable that it  would  be  completely  anathema  to
    anybody in care in Eritrea to contemplate the taking of photographs  in
    a mosque and it would be obvious to them that the  photographs  of  the
    marriage must be a reference to photographs  at  the  home  afterwards.
    This point again is one that could be regarded as a somewhat harsh  one
    but it was not put to the First-tier Tribunal that the pictures  simply
    could not have been taken at the mosque for the reason  we  have  given
    and it may be that we have misunderstood Sharia law or were basing  our
    previous  observations  on  a  misunderstanding  of  local  custom  and
    practice.  The fact remains that this was a point which the  First-tier
    Tribunal was entitled to reach on the available evidence and  which  we
    cannot upset on perversity or irrationality grounds.

18. The next point relates to the delay in applying for settlement on  this
    basis under the Rules  because  as  we  have  already  observed,  under
    paragraph 40  of  the  determination,  it  is  said  that  no  credible
    explanation has been advanced as to why the appellant waited so long to
    make the application.  It is now said or it may  well  have  been  said
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  there  is  a   straightforward
    explanation for this, namely that the appellant did not  leave  Eritrea
    for Sudan until 2012 and as we pointed out the refugee card was  issued
    to her in May 2012.  It simply was not possible to apply  from  Eritrea
    since there is no Embassy or Entry  Clearance  Office  in  Eritrea  and
    frankly there is merit in that point and it may be, probably is in fact
    right to say that the decision is unduly harsh, arguably perverse on it
    but the difficulty is it is only one point  amongst  a  mass  of  other
    credibility point and we simply cannot reach the  conclusion  that  the
    whole decision falls to the  grounds  because  an  arguably  irrational
    decision has been reached on one aspect of the case.  The appellant has
    to face the reality that adverse credibility findings  are  made  on  a
    numerous series of bases and the point we have  latched  onto  here  is
    only one out of many.  Although sympathetic with that ground of  appeal
    it is not sufficient by itself unless there are other grounds which can
    succeed to bring the appellant home before us today.

19. The next point really goes back to a previous point.  It is said by  Ms
    Themistocleous that too much weight was put on the photographs and this
    reverts back to paragraph 40 of the determination  and  the  fact  that
    photographs were not provided at the time that the marriage certificate
    was furnished to the unknown person mentioned in paragraph 40.  That  I
    am afraid is a point which cannot get very far before this Tribunal, it
    is an issue of fact, it may be that too much weight was put on  it  but
    too much weight does not amount to a ground of appeal.   It  is  within
    the margin of appreciation, it is within the fact-finding evaluation of
    the First-tier Tribunal and we are simply  not  prepared  to  interfere
    with it.

20. The seventh point relates to the e-mails and indeed that point comes up
    in a number of ways but the first way in which it comes up, and this is
    a point which actually appealed to a judge granting permission in  this
    case, is the explanation given in paragraph 49 of the determination for
    not being able to obtain e-mails on the blocked account does not appear
    to be a particularly compelling explanation.  The problem with  all  of
    this is that there is a perfectly simply way in which the point can  be
    put against the appellant and it works like  this,  that  even  if  the
    password had been forgotten or the account blocked, and  we  know  that
    this  was  an  account  operated  by  Yahoo,   it   is   a   relatively
    straightforward process to unblock the account and a fresh password  is
    provided on request to the username  supplied  in  the  first  instance
    which of course is the e-mail address.  Forgetting of passwords is  not
    an insuperable obstacle to the obtaining of re-entry to the account and
    copying of earlier e-mails which ere valuable evidence if they  existed
    which could and should have been adduced to this  First-tier  Tribunal.
    In any event, as Mr Jack  pointed  out,  that  even  if  the  sponsor's
    account was blocked there is no evidence that the  appellant's  account
    was blocked.  So for slightly different reasons than those provided  by
    the First-tier Tribunal there is nothing in that ground of appeal.

21. The other ground  of  appeal  which  relates  to  the  e-mails  is  the
    conclusion set out in paragraph 47 of the determination ...to  the  two
    Yahoo e-mails which were provided namely those dated  16  June  and  26
    June 2012.  The inference drawn from the scrutiny of those e-mails  was
    that "I find the terms of these e-mails indicative of a desire to leave
    Sudan and  enter  the  United  Kingdom  rather  than  indicative  of  a
    subsisting marriage".  We have described earlier  findings  as  on  the
    harsh side and this finding, we think, falls into the same category but
    at the end of the day the  inferences  to  be  drawn  from  documentary
    material such as this were for the Tribunal, they are not for us and we
    are not prepared to say that the inferences drawn in paragraph  47  are
    perverse or irrational inferences.

22. The remaining points of appeal were not frankly the strongest, there is
    no mention  of  the  telephone  cards  in  the  determination  but  the
    telephone cards would never have proved to  whom,  and  from  whom  the
    calls were made.  There was some evidence of telephone contact but that
    appears most of it at least to have been postdecision,  all  the  Skype
    contact was postdecision.  The conclusion reached in paragraph  49  was
    that any evidence of contact is of recent origin and largely  postdated
    the refusal notice made on 11 November 2012.   These  were  permissible
    findings and no error of law  in  our  judgment  was  displayed  or  is
    displayed.

23. The conclusions on Article 8 are entirely parasitic as it were  on  the
    conclusions on the Rules and  the  claim  under  Article  8  could  not
    succeed on an independent or freestanding basis.  It is  possible  that
    with different and better evidence  this  claim  could  have  succeeded
    before the First-tier Tribunal  but  on  the  available  evidence  this
    Tribunal in a reasonably careful decision reached  a  conclusion  which
    was within acceptable parameters of decision-making, reasoning and fact-
    findings.  Our conclusion is that this appeal must be dismissed.
