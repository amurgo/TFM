               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Khan
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I refer to my decision promulgated on 30 January  2017.  Confusion  has
    subsequently arisen as to whether the Secretary of State has or has not
    granted leave to remain to the appellant. I was  under  the  impression
    that he had done so and accordingly on  4  January  2018  purported  to
    issue a notice of abandonment. It  transpires  that  the  Secretary  of
    State has not granted leave to remain to the appellant. I was  assisted
    by both representatives at the For Mention hearing which  I  listed  at
    Bradford on 2 May 2019. Both parties are agreed  that  I  should  issue
    this decision allowing the appellant's appeal against the Secretary  of
    State's refusal of his application for international protection.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed on asylum and human rights (Article 3 ECHR) grounds.


Signed                              Date 2 May 2019
