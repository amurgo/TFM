                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction


 1. By decision promulgated on 18 September 2017  ("the  UT  Decision")  we
    allowed an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    ("the Secretary of State") against  the  decision  of  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal ("the FTT") promulgated on 7 July 2016  ("the  FTT  Decision")
    and  set  it  aside,  pursuant  to  s.12(2)(a)  Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 ("the 2007 Act").  We further  indicated  that  we
    intended, pursuant to our power under s.12(2)(b)(ii) of the  2007  Act,
    to re-make the decision.


 2. This is  our  decision  on  re-making.   Our  decision  comprises  this
    decision ("the Main Decision") and  a  second,  confidential,  decision
    ("the Confidential Decision").  The former is to be read in conjunction
    with the latter.

 3. For ease of reference, we attach hereto as "Annex A" a copy of  the  UT
    Decision and as "Annex B" a copy of the FTT  Decision.   References  to
    the UT Decision are to "UT �" and to the FTT Decision to "FTT  �".   In
    these Decisions, the terminology and abbreviations in the  UT  Decision
    are adopted.  The anonymity direction made at UT �1 remains  in  place.
    For the purposes of these Decisions, and to reflect the position before
    the FTT, we refer to A as the Appellant, with the Secretary of State as
    the Respondent.

 4. In accordance with UT �106, and following further  directions  made  by
    order dated 20 October 2017, we  received,  in  the  period  up  to  20
    November 2017, further written and oral submissions in relation to  the
    re-making decision.

 5. For the reasons given in this Main Decision  and  in  the  Confidential
    Decision, the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to remove him, dated 16 June 2015, is dismissed.

Summary of the case

 6. On 16 June 2015 the Secretary of State decided to  make  a  deportation
    order against the Appellant on the grounds that he was the head of  the
    A Organised Crime Group ("the OCG").  The  deportation  order  and  the
    appeal to the FTT are summarised at UT ��3 to 6.  The background  facts
    of the case are at UT �9 to 17.    The  relevant  people  involved  are
    identified at UT �9, 10 and 12.


 7. The FTT Decision itself is summarised at UT �7 and explained in greater
    detail at UT ��18 to 41. (The conclusions of the FTT themselves are  at
    FTT ��144 to 154.)

 8. The basis of the appeal to this Tribunal is summarised at UT �8 and the
    parties' submissions at the error of law hearing are at UT ��42 to  57.
    Our conclusions on error of law are at UT �104, referring back  to  the
    earlier paragraphs there identified.  In summary, we found that the FTT
    erred:

      1) in relation  to  specific  issues,  requiring  proof  to  a  higher
         standard than that of the balance of probabilities;


      2) in failing to take account of material evidence and/or findings  of
         fact on material matters;

      3) in not resolving an issue of fact in relation to a material matter;


      4) in making inconsistent findings.

 9. In particular, the FTT erred in its approach to  the  first  two  "Abi"
    conversations in March 2014,  the  "dream"  conversation,  the  Z  Road
    shooting, the Appellant's association with B, events relating to D, the
    evidence of AS and the Appellant's hidden wealth.


10. The issue on the appeal, both before the FTT  and  now  before  us,  is
    whether the Appellant is the head of the A OCG or was in the  past  the
    head of the A OCG and has the ability to revive the OCG.  That involves
    two questions: (1) whether the OCG continued to exist at  the  relevant
    time and (2) the Appellant's involvement in the OCG.

The approach to re-making

11. Section 12(4) of the 2007 Act provides that, in re-making the decision,
    we may make any decision which the FTT could make if the FTT  were  re-
    making the decision and may make such findings of fact that we consider
    appropriate.


12. We have before us the documentary evidence that was before the FTT.  We
    have not heard further oral evidence.   With one exception (to which we
    refer to in paragraph 16 below), the evidence before us is the same  as
    the evidence that was before the FTT.  The record of the oral  evidence
    before the FTT is available to us, although in fact neither party seeks
    to rely upon it.

13. It is common ground that whilst we are not bound  by  the  findings  of
    fact made by the FTT, where, as  here,  the  FTT  has  heard  the  oral
    evidence and reached  conclusions,  we  can  and  should  accept  those
    findings, unless there is good reason not to do  so.   Nevertheless  we
    are entitled to look at the entirety of the evidence before us, even if
    not expressly referred to in the FTT Decision.   In  fact,  at  various
    points each party invites us in  some  instances  to  adopt  the  FTT's
    findings and in others to disagree  with,  or  to  add  to,  the  FTT's
    findings.

14. In general  our  approach  on  this  re-making  is,  in  principle  and
    ultimately, to make our own findings.  Nevertheless we will  adopt  the
    FTT's findings - particularly findings of primary fact -  unless  there
    is good reason not  to  do  so.   Of  course,  since  we  have  already
    concluded that the FTT erred in law in certain important respects,  and
    in particular in relation to its ultimate findings of fact, we make our
    own findings, both  on  those  matters,  and  in  relation  to  matters
    relevant to those findings.

The course of the re-making

15. At an oral hearing on 20 November 2017 the parties  put  forward  their
    respective cases on the re-making of the FTT Decision.


16. Prior to the hearing  the  Appellant  had  applied  to  adduce  further
    evidence.  In the result, we admitted into evidence a determination  of
    the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) concerning tax  assessments  made
    against the Appellant's wife ("The Tax  Chamber  judgment").   This  is
    addressed in paragraphs 59 to 62 below.  As regards a  further  undated
    witness statement from the Appellant himself, whilst we did  not  admit
    this into evidence, we accept that UT �17 wrongly stated  that  at  the
    trial in January 2015 the jury did not reach a verdict  in  respect  of
    the Appellant and that, in fact,  the  Appellant  was  acquitted  by  a
    majority.  Further by order of 20 October 2017, we had refused to admit
    the Appellant's further evidence concerning the meeting on  29  January
    2014 (to which we refer at paragraph 26 below), pointing out  that  the
    question of who had organised that meeting was  not  relevant  and  had
    never been in issue in the proceedings.

17. Two days after the conclusion of the oral hearing, a further matter was
    drawn to our attention.  This matter is the subject of the Confidential
    Decision.  This Main Decision addresses the issues  considered  at  the
    oral hearing on 20 November 2017.

The Parties' submissions

18. In general, the Appellant relies upon his  skeleton  argument  for  the
    hearing, and his closing written  submissions,  before  the  FTT  dated
    April and June 2016 respectively.  He submits in summary, that  we  are
    not bound by the FTT findings of fact; and other passages  in  the  FTT
    Decision  require  careful  scrutiny.   The  Secretary  of  State  must
    establish that the Appellant was the head of  the  OCG,  yet  in  three
    years of surveillance material there is no  one  saying  that  he  was.
    Cumulatively, the evidence  cannot  support  the  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant occupied such a high position in the OCG.


19. The Secretary of State relies upon his outline closing submission  from
    the FTT hearing in June 2016 and a further skeleton for  the  re-making
    dated 15 November 2017.  He submits that having  regard  to  the  FTT's
    findings of fact and their true significance,  and  in  the  continuing
    absence of any alternative explanation, the Secretary of State has made
    out his case on the balance of probability.  There is a A OCG of  which
    the Appellant is currently the head, or  at  the  least  that  was  the
    position in the past and the Appellant has the ability  to  revive  the
    OCG.

Relevant legal principles

20. The legal background is summarised at UT �58.  Regulation  21,  and  in
    particular regulation 21(5) and (6) of the EEA Regulations is  set  out
    at FTT �156.


21. Expanding on this summary, we have been referred in particular  to  the
    following case authority: Case 30/77 R v Bouchereau [1977] 2 CMLR  800;
    R (Lumsdon) v Legal Services Board [2015] UKSC 41 at �63;  Secretary of
    State for the Home Department v Robinson (Jamaica) [2018] EWCA  Civ  85
    [2018] 4 WLR 81 at ��68 to 86; Joined Cases C-331/16 and C-366/16  K  v
    Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie [2018] 3 CMLR 26 ��61 to 64
    and KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2018]
    UKSC 53 [2018] 1 WLR 5273.  We draw  the  following  propositions  from
    these authorities:


    (1)  The decision to deport or remove must be based exclusively on  the
         personal conduct of the person concerned and must be  founded  upon
         "the existence of  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
         threat" to the requirements of public policy or public security:  K
         at ��48 and 49.


    (2)  A propensity to act in the same  way  in  the  future  is  usually
         implicit in such a finding.


    (3)  However past conduct alone may constitute such a threat and may be
         sufficient to justify removal on these grounds. In an extreme  case
         the threat might be evidenced by past conduct which has caused deep
         public revulsion and/or which  is  repugnant  to  the  public:  see
         Bouchereau, K at �56 and Robinson.


    (4)  The possible exceptional gravity of the acts in question might  be
         such as to require, even after a relatively  long  period  of  time
         since the commission of the acts in  question,  that  the  genuine,
         present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  be  classified  as
         persistent:  K at �58.


    (5)  However, a  measure  which  restricts  the  right  of  freedom  of
         movement must comply with the  principle  of  proportionality;  the
         threat that  the  personal  conduct  of  the  individual  concerned
         represents to the fundamental interests of the host society must be
         weighed against the rights  of  Union  citizens  and  their  family
         members: K at ��61  to  63.   In  particular  it  is  necessary  to
         determine whether it is possible to adopt other measures which  are
         less prejudicial to freedom  of  movement  and  residence  but  are
         equally effective to  ensure  the  protection  of  the  fundamental
         interests (of public policy or public security): K at �64.   But it
         is not necessary for the  Member  State  to  prove  that  no  other
         conceivable, less restrictive  measure  could  have  been  used  to
         achieve the same objective: Lumsdon at �63.


    (6)  Proportionality is a matter to be determined by the court  itself,
         and is not limited to a  review  of  the  decision  of  the  public
         authority: Lumsdon ��29 and 101.


    (7)  If and in so far as relevant to the facts of the present case,  as
         regards the balance between the best interests of the child and the
         gravity of the conduct of the person to be removed or deported,  in
         the case of deportation of a foreign criminal under s.117C  of  the
         Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002  Act"),  the
         question whether it would be unduly  harsh  on  the  child  if  the
         parent were deported is to be  determined  without  regard  to  the
         criminality of the parent's offences.  However the  "unduly  harsh"
         test is a high hurdle; what must be  established  is  a  degree  of
         harshness going beyond what would  normally  be  involved  for  any
         child faced with deportation of a parent.   KO  (Nigeria)  has  not
         affected the assessment  of  the  impact  upon  the  child  of  the
         deportation and the test that needs to be applied.


Discussion and Analysis

22. We consider first the issue of the  existence  of  the  OCG,  and  then
    secondly the  Appellant's  involvement  in  the  OCG.   In  the  latter
    section, we consider the various strands of relevant evidence, broadly,
    under the headings adopted by the FTT at ��41 to 143.  However we  have
    ordered these strands to follow a broadly  chronological  sequence,  as
    adopted by the Secretary of State in his submissions on the re-making.


(1)  The existence of the OCG

23. This is addressed at UT ��20 to  21,  75  to  78.   As  Mr  O'Callaghan
    accepted in argument, the issue for us is the  question  of  "risk"  to
    public policy and public security at  the  time  that  we  re-make  the
    decision and that risk will be present, not only if  the  Appellant  is
    head of the OCG as it exists, but also if he has the ability to  revive
    it.   As we concluded at UT �76, we agree with the FTT,  and  we  find,
    that in order to determine the issue on the appeal it is not  necessary
    to make a clear finding one way or the other as to whether, at the time
    of the FTT Decision or this decision, the OCG existed or exists.  It is
    sufficient that the Appellant has the capability to revive the OCG.  An
    express finding, one way or the other, about the continued existence of
    the OCG is not necessary.  In circumstances of its past existence,  and
    assuming that the Appellant was head of that organisation, the  ability
    to revive the OCG is, in our judgment, sufficient to create a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat to public policy and/or  public
    security.

24. We find on the facts that the OCG clearly existed in  the  past.    The
    Appellant accepted this. On the facts (and in the light of our findings
    below as to the Appellant's position as head of the OCG in the past) we
    find that the Appellant has the ability to revive the OCG and  that  is
    sufficient.  Whilst in some cases, events might have moved  on  in  the
    course of an appeal process, there is nothing in the evidence before us
    to suggest that, in the period since the most recent  evidence  of  its
    existence, the risk arising from the Appellant's involvement in the OCG
    has now dissipated.

(2)  The Appellant's involvement in the OCG

Security conscious behaviour

25. The Secretary of State relies upon evidence which he believes shows the
    Appellant  exhibiting  security-conscious  behaviour  consistent   with
    involvement in and/or being head of an OCG.  This was addressed at  FTT
    ��78 to 82, as summarised at UT �30.  Of particular  relevance  is  the
    recorded conversation between the Appellant and B on  27  January  2014
    discussing the possibility of a listening device having been  installed
    in the latter's car.  As to this,  we  note  that  the  FTT  heard  and
    rejected the Appellant's own evidence explaining this conversation.  We
    agree with the FTT's finding (�81) that  in  the  conversation  "B  was
    hypothesising about there being a listening device which the police had
    installed" in his vehicle and that this part of  the  conversation  was
    concerned with a different car from the  Audi  that  they  went  on  to
    discuss.  Mr O'Callaghan accepted this in argument.  Whilst  we  accept
    his further submissions that that conversation did not amount to an in-
    depth discussion about their fear of surveillance, nevertheless neither
    B nor the Appellant exhibited any surprise that the police  might  have
    wanted  to  put  a  listening  device  in  B's  car.   This  is  highly
    significant.  Whilst this may not be direct and clear evidence  of  the
    Appellant operating as the head of an OCG,  the  fact  that  they  were
    discussing such a listening device, and that that came as  no  surprise
    to them, are further facts which are consistent  with,  and  supportive
    of, such a conclusion.  The fact that the conversation concerned  other
    matters too does not detract from such a conclusion.

D


26. The background relating to D is set out at UT ��12-15 and FTT �83.  Two
    aspects of events concerning D are of potential  relevance:  first  the
    transcript of a meeting on 29 January 2014 where the Appellant, in  the
    presence of B, amongst others, gave D  a  "severe  roasting"  (see  FTT
    ��51, 83, 85); secondly, the Appellant's  involvement  and  purpose  in
    efforts to find D after he fled on 4 March 2014 (FTT ��85 to 89).   See
    further UT ��31 and 32.


27. As to the first aspect, it is common ground that the lengthy transcript
    of that meeting constituted a "severe roasting" and we  concur  in  the
    FTT's finding that the Appellant was "venting his spleen ..." (UT  �14,
    FTT  �51)  and  "using  highly  offensive,  demeaning  and  provocative
    language over a very lengthy period" (FTT �85).

28. The Appellant contends that the full content of the argument shows that
    it was merely a business related argument, diverging off  at  tangents,
    but confirming that the bottom line was that he  did  not  want  to  be
    considered a wheeler and dealer.  It was not a crime boss holding court
    with a victim.

29. However the significance of this transcript is  not  limited  to  those
    general descriptions of the tone of the meeting.  The Appellant tells D
    that he had sent "messages  to  all  including  the  Iranians  and  the
    Albanians and asked them not to touch him".  Even though D  is  present
    at the time, we are satisfied that in the context of that part  of  the
    transcript "him" is  a  reference  to  D,  himself.   Whilst  the  mere
    reference to Iranians and Albanians is not of  itself  a  reference  to
    criminality, in our judgment  on  any  view  the  Appellant  is  giving
    instructions  to  others,  including  persons  abroad  or  of   foreign
    nationality, not to harm D.  Secondly, in that part of  the  transcript
    and in later passages the Appellant refers to himself,  and  refers  to
    others referring to him, as  "Abi".    The  first  and  other  passages
    demonstrate the power of the Appellant to give instructions to harm, or
    not to harm,  D.   This  is  supportive  of  the  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant is a man with considerable power over others and, whilst  not
    of itself conclusive as to his position, is consistent with  him  being
    the head of the OCG and exercising his power as such over D.


30. As to the second aspect, we agree with the FTT in its finding (at �88),
    on the correct standard of proof, that the  Appellant  was  seeking  to
    trace D and find a way to "encounter him" and that his intentions  went
    beyond having an ordinary business  meeting.    In  the  light  of  the
    extremely intimidatory approach taken at the 29 January 2014,  we  find
    that, on the  balance  of  probabilities,  the  Appellant's  intentions
    towards D, once found, were nefarious, and were to  give  him,  at  the
    least, a very severely intimidatory warning - in line with what he  had
    said at the 29 January meeting - thereby indicating that the  Appellant
    would, at least, have the power  to  exercise  some  form  of  punitive
    power.  The steps taken to trace D,  in  the  context  of  the  extreme
    verbal intimidation and the  enlisting  of  the  support  of  unsavoury
    characters,  including  B  (who  had  no  connection  with  the  drinks
    business) supports a finding that the Appellant was  a  man  with  very
    substantial power, and is consistent with him acting as the head of the
    OCG.

AS

31. AS is the Appellant's sister in law.  The  Secretary  of  State  relies
    upon a recorded conversation between her and B  on  12  February  2014.
    The background is set out UT �36 and in further detail  at  FTT  ��133-
    137.  We agree with the FTT's conclusion  that  AS  believed  that  the
    Appellant was involved in criminal  activities,  and  for  the  reasons
    stated at ��136 and 137.  We found at UT �102 that  the  FTT  erred  in
    failing to go on to consider what those criminal  activities  were,  or
    might have been.


32. We accept that the mere fact that AS believed that  the  Appellant  had
    been involved in criminal activities does not  establish  the  fact  of
    those  activities  having  taken  place.   Nevertheless,  AS  in   that
    conversation referred, without distinction, to the  activities  of  the
    Appellant and of AB3. AB3 had been heavily involved in organised  crime
    and was, before his arrest, the head of the OCG:  FTT �33  to  34,  and
    accepted by Mr O'Callaghan in argument.  At the time, AB3 was serving a
    very long sentence for drugs and money laundering and had been found to
    be near to the top of  the  supply  chain  (FTT  �17).   AB3  was  AS's
    husband.  We conclude that, on the balance of probabilities, AS was  by
    that time aware of the nature of AB3's criminal activities  and  it  is
    therefore to be inferred that the Appellant's criminal activities, that
    AS believed he had been involved in, were of the same kind as those  of
    her husband; and that those were connected with organised crime and the
    OCG and that they arose from his position as the head of the OCG.  This
    is a further finding which, taken with others,  is  supportive  of  the
    conclusion that the Appellant was at the time, and after AB3  had  been
    imprisoned, the head of the OCG.


The Appellant's place in the hierarchy

33. On this issue, a number of strands of evidence fall to be considered.

Conversation between E and B: 13 February 2014

34. On 13 February 2014 there was a recorded conversation between B and  E,
    discussing what might happen if "AB" "came back": see UT ��25, and  79-
    84, and FTT ��52 to 57.  At �57, the FTT  found  (and  it  is  not  now
    disputed) that the reference to  "AB"  was  a  reference  to  AB1,  the
    Appellant's older brother and a  former  head  of  the  OCG.   For  the
    reasons given at UT �80, we concluded that the FTT had found that  that
    conversation supported the conclusion that the Appellant  was  head  of
    the OCG. We went on to find ourselves (UT �82) that the FTT's  findings
    were clear and important findings of a connection between the Appellant
    and the OCG  and,  at  the  least,  highly  relevant  evidence  of  the
    Appellant's leading position in the OCG.  However, the FTT had erred in
    failing to take into  account  that  evidence,  and  its  own  findings
    thereon, in reaching its final conclusions  regarding  the  Appellant's
    position in the OCG:  UT �84.


35. We agree and accept the FTT's  findings  at  FTT  �57  and  repeat  our
    findings at UT �82.  The conversation  demonstrates,  first,  that  the
    Appellant and B were united  in  an  enterprise  of  some  description;
    secondly,  B's  description  of  the  Appellant  in  that  conversation
    demonstrates that the Appellant was a superior to B; thirdly  that  the
    Appellant and AB1 (who had  been  the  head  of  the  OCG)  were  being
    discussed in one and the same context of a  power  struggle;  fourthly,
    the Appellant has no answer to the significance of this conversation.

36. Mr O'Callaghan submitted that it was difficult to  understand  why  AB1
    should have been returning from Holland.  However,  first,  this  point
    was expressly dealt with by the FTT at �54; and secondly, regardless of
    that fact, the Appellant conceded at the  re-making  hearing  that  the
    conversation was referring to AB1.  Mr  O'Callaghan  further  submitted
    that B was prone to grandiose hyperbole and that this one assertion  by
    B cannot properly be relied  upon  to  fill  a  gap  in  the  evidence.
    However what cannot be doubted is that AB1 and the Appellant are  being
    discussed in the same terms - it is clear evidence  supporting  a  link
    between the Appellant and the OCG - and, even if  an  exaggeration,  no
    reason is given for B having said this untruthfully.

37. In considering the overall question as to whether, on  the  balance  of
    probabilities, the Appellant was the  head  of  the  OCG  (or  has  the
    ability to revive it), this finding provides the strongest support that
    the Appellant was head of the OCG.  It is,  at  the  very  least,  more
    likely than not that  in  this  conversation  B  is  referring  to  the
    Appellant and AB1 as alternative heads of  the  OCG  and  that  he,  B,
    recognises and will continue to recognise the Appellant  as  the  head.
    Indeed no alternative explanation for the content of  the  conversation
    has been put forward.

"Centralisation" 18 February 2014

38. On 18 February 2014 there  was  a  recorded  conversation  between  the
    Appellant  and  B,   in   which   the   Appellant   talks   about   the
    "centralisation" saying that  he  has  managed  or  tried  to  distance
    himself from "centralisation", indicating  that  he  lets  others  take
    initiatives and "if such a set up can be established, you would  become
    immortal": see UT ��23, 26, FTT ��58 to 61.  At ��59 and  60,  the  FTT
    rejected  the   Appellant's   explanations   in   evidence   for   this
    conversation, finding it, at �61, unsatisfactory.  However at  �61  the
    FTT declined to find that the conversation supported the case that  the
    Appellant was head of the OCG because it  was  not  sufficiently  clear
    that no other interpretations were possible.  In the  UT  Decision,  we
    considered that this was an example of an erroneous application for the
    standard of proof: UT ��44 and 73 to 74.


39. Mr O'Callaghan nevertheless sought to uphold the  FTT's  conclusion  at
    FTT �61; even on the balance of probabilities,  it  did  not  show  the
    Appellant giving orders as to how the OCG should be arranged so  as  to
    ensure  nothing  that  happened  was  attributable  to  him.   Moreover
    centralisation does not establish that he was head of an OCG.

40. We do not accept these submissions. Applying the  correct  standard  of
    proof, and taken in conjunction with the FTT's finding at �42 about how
    an OCG is likely to be run, we conclude that it is more likely than not
    that in this conversation, the Appellant was explaining his approach to
    running an organisation, how he directed others and that amongst  those
    others he was directing was  B  and  how,  in  line  with  that  likely
    approach, he distanced himself to avoid detection.

First "Abi" conversation between B and C:  7 March 2014

41. On 7 March 2014 there was a recorded conversation between B  and  C  in
    B's  car  in  which  the  two  men  appear  to  be  talking  about  the
    remuneration they receive from someone  called  "Abi".   The  Appellant
    accepted in evidence that they  might  have  been  talking  about  him.
    Whilst the FTT did not accept the Appellant's explanation of  why  they
    were talking about how much they received from the  Appellant  or  what
    they were talking about, ultimately the FTT was not able to come  to  a
    firm  conclusion  about  whether  the   two   were   discussing   their
    relationship with the Appellant.  It could not be said that there  were
    no other possible interpretations of the conversations:  UT  ��24,  FTT
    ��43 to 46.


42. In the UT Decision, we considered that the FTT erred in its approach to
    and conclusions in relation to, this conversation: see UT ��96, and  44
    and 73 to 74.

43. Mr O'Callaghan submitted that, nevertheless,  the  conclusions  at  FTT
    ��45 and 46 should stand.  First any reference  to  "Abi"  (a  term  of
    respect for numerous people) is not  necessarily  a  reference  to  the
    Appellant. Secondly, the payments are the same for both  B  and  for  C
    and, if there was a hierarchy, they would not be.

44. We consider that the FTT's reliance (��45 and 46) upon  the  fact  that
    the Appellant is  not  named  in  the  extract  is  undermined  by  the
    Appellant's own admission in his own evidence that they might have been
    talking about him.  The fact that B was "not exclusively paid  by  Abi"
    does not rule out or exclude the fact that "Abi" is the  Appellant  and
    in part they were paid by Abi.  The evidence was that whilst B may have
    had other sources of income, he never worked for anyone other than  the
    Appellant.  We find on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  in  this
    conversation B and C were talking about the Appellant and referring  to
    him as "Abi".  We agree  that  whilst  it  is  not  necessary  to  make
    detailed findings about what  pay,  and  by  and  to  whom,  was  being
    discussed  and  it  is  not  possible  to  do  so,  nevertheless   this
    conversation  provides  further  support  for  the  existence   of   an
    "organisation" and, given the Appellant's own evidence,  one  in  which
    the Appellant is high in the hierarchy.  If it is right that there  was
    an organisation, the Appellant was unable to say who else,  other  than
    him, would have been paying B.  There is clearly a reference to B being
    paid money.


Second "Abi" conversation between B and C 10 March 2014

45. On 10 March 2014 there was a second recorded conversation between B and
    C in B's car in which the two men talk about  a  previous  conversation
    between  B  and  D  in  relation  to  the  drinks  business.   In  that
    conversation B had told D that only "Abi" could tell  him,  B,  to  get
    involved in a business.  Again the Appellant accepted in evidence  that
    B could have been referring to him. The FTT concluded that the  extract
    might be read as showing B acting subserviently towards the  Appellant,
    but that was not the only interpretation possible and  it  did  not  go
    very far in establishing the Appellant as the head of an OCG: UT  ��24,
    FTT ��47 to 51.


46. In the UT Decision, again we considered  that  the  FTT  erred  in  its
    approach, and conclusions, in relation to  this  conversation:  see  UT
    ��96, and 44 and 73 to 74.  It was not necessary for the  Secretary  of
    State to show that no other  interpretation  of  the  conversation  was
    possible.

47. Mr O'Callaghan first relied upon his June 2016 submissions, in which it
    was accepted that this part of the conversation was a reference to  the
    Appellant, but all that B was doing was suggesting he should check with
    the Appellant as one of the other partners in the drinks business.  The
    conversation did not indicate that B would only act on a  command  from
    the Appellant.  Mr O'Callaghan then submitted, somewhat inconsistently,
    that it was not clear that "Abi" referred to the Appellant, because  at
    other points in the recording, "Abi" referred to someone  else.   "Abi"
    in the passage relied upon by the Secretary of State could be one of  a
    number of others in the drinks business and moreover it was  not  clear
    what business was being referred to.  He accepted however that, in  the
    relevant passage, "Abi" could not be a reference to D.

48. We consider, first, that the relevant passage in the recording  amounts
    to something more than B "seeking advice"  from  "Abi".   It  is  clear
    evidence of B taking instruction  from  "Abi"  and  acknowledging  that
    "Abi" is his superior.  As to the identity of "Abi"  in  that  passage,
    given the Appellant's own evidence and indeed his case before the  FTT,
    we find, on the balance of probabilities,  that  in  that  passage  B's
    reference to "Abi" was a reference to the Appellant.   Indeed  the  FTT
    itself appeared to accept this.   (In  this  regard  we  refer  to  the
    earlier  reference  to  the  Appellant  as  "Abi"   in   the   recorded
    conversation of B on 7 January 2014: see paragraph 69 below.)

49. Accordingly we find that  this  is  evidence  of  the  Appellant  being
    superior to B in the hierarchy.

The Z Road shooting

50. In two recorded conversations between  B  and  the  Appellant,  in  B's
    armoured car, on 23 and 24 May 2014, B passed on news  of  the  Z  Road
    shooting to the Appellant.  XY's interpretation of the conversation was
    that the Appellant had given B permission for retaliatory action to  be
    taken against those  who  had  attacked  the  shop.   The  FTT  however
    concluded that the conversations did not  clearly  establish  that  the
    Appellant had issued instructions to retaliate and that  this  evidence
    did not support the depiction of the Appellant as head  of  a  ruthless
    OCG:  UT ��28 and 29 and 40, FTT ��67 to 77 and 152.


51. In the UT Decision, we found that, in relation to  this  evidence,  the
    FTT made inconsistent findings (at ��74 and 77) as to the  significance
    of the absence of any retaliation in fact taking  place;  and  secondly
    that the FTT had mischaracterised the Secretary of State's case  as  to
    what was the import of those conversations - confusing the  issuing  of
    an instruction and the giving of permission: UT ��85 to 90.

52. The Secretary  of  State  submitted  that  the  significance  of  these
    conversations is wider  and  more  general  than  whether  or  not  the
    Appellant was giving an order to retaliate.  The context and content of
    the conversation as a whole shows that  the  Appellant  is  head  of  a
    violent OCG.

53. Mr O'Callaghan submitted that the FTT was wrong, at �74, not to draw an
    inference,  in  the  Appellant's  favour,  from  the  absence  of   any
    retaliation in fact.  The inference that should be drawn is that  there
    was no order to retaliate and thus that there was no A  OCG.   He  also
    relied upon the fact that the "order" was not given until the following
    day.

54. We do not accept this submission.   The FTT's  conclusion  at  �74  was
    correct.  The Secretary of State's case was  not  that  there  was  "an
    order" to retaliate, but rather that the Appellant gave  permission  to
    do so. The fact that there was no retaliation might  have  been  for  a
    number of reasons: G was in custody; the person to whom permission  was
    granted decided not to retaliate.   Moreover,  the  fact  that  it  was
    permission, and not an order, that the  Appellant  gave  does  not,  of
    itself, indicate that the Appellant could not have been acting as  head
    of an OCG.

55. Secondly, the entirety of the conversations and their context (in  time
    and place) establish that  the  Appellant  was  someone  familiar  with
    weapons, familiar with people who carry weapons and was  giving  advice
    about what should be done with weapons.  The conversations were  taking
    place immediately following, and concerning, a  shooting  in  a  public
    place, in the armoured car of a  known  violent  man,  B.   Information
    about the shooting was relayed by B to the Appellant in the  car.   See
    FTT ��68, 70 and 71. At �77, the FTT found that it was  "curious"  that
    this happened.  However we are satisfied and find that the  passing  on
    of  this  information  was  more  than  casual  conversation;  it   was
    deliberate.  That this was done  in  these  circumstances  is  evidence
    supporting the Appellant's position as the head of an OCG.

Hidden Wealth

56. The FTT concluded that it was not satisfied that the Appellant  enjoyed
    a lifestyle consistent with his being the head of an OCG, nor  that  he
    had been hiding his wealth: FTT ��153, and 110 and 115; UT ��97 and  98
    (and 33 to 35).  However, we found  that  this  was  inconsistent  with
    specific findings  of  the  FTT  relating  to  mortgage  payments,  his
    business dealings and A Cars.  The Appellant had hidden his wealth from
    the FTT and it was  a  fair  inference  that  he  had  hidden  it  more
    generally: UT ��99 and 100 referring to findings  at  FTT  ��104,  112,
    114, 127, 128 and 130.  We found that in this regard the FTT had  erred
    in law.  Moreover the FTT had not explored further the only explanation
    given by the Appellant - notoriety and connections within the community
    and operating on the fringes of legality.


57. As the FTT had found (FTT ��110, 130, 153), despite there being a money
    laundering investigation into the affairs  of  the  Appellant  and  his
    wife, there had been no prosecution.  However, we took  the  view  that
    this conclusion was not determinative of the  question  whether  wealth
    had been hidden: UT �101.

58. The Secretary of State maintains his contention that we should  make  a
    finding of hidden wealth and that  provides  strong  support  that  the
    Appellant was  head  of  the  OCG.   The  reference  to  notoriety  and
    connections within the community chimes with the FTT's further  finding
    (FTT �111) as to the basis upon which the Appellant was able to  obtain
    credit.

The Tax Chamber judgment

59. The FTT had also referred to the fact that  the  Appellant's  wife  had
    been served by the NCA with a notice of assessment to tax and that,  at
    that time, the matter was yet to be resolved: FTT ��107 and 108.   That
    matter has now  been  resolved  and  is  the  subject  of  Tax  Chamber
    judgment.


60. At the re-making hearing, Mr O'Callaghan relied  upon  the  absence  of
    prosecution and  went  on  to  rely,  further,  upon  the  Tax  Chamber
    judgment.  He submitted that the high point of the case in relation  to
    financial matters was the case put  before  the  Tax  Chamber  and  yet
    nothing substantial was found.  The Tax Chamber's conclusions were  not
    consistent with there being organised crime.  Mr  Hall  submitted  that
    there were findings in the judgment consistent with  the  Secretary  of
    State's case, and that in any event the  judgment  addressed  only  the
    position of the Appellant's wife.

61. The issue before the Tax Chamber was whether the Appellant's  wife  had
    received income chargeable to tax for years within the period  2004  to
    2009 and whether that income had arisen or accrued as a result of  her,
    or another person's, criminal conduct.  The Tax Chamber concluded  that
    there had been no loss of tax.  Whilst  there  were  unexplained  sums,
    those sums had not been derived from trade.

62. In the course of the judgment, the Tax Chamber found that the  NCA  did
    have reasonable suspicions that the wife's income arose  from  criminal
    conduct, namely money laundering relating to the  affairs  of  A  Cars.
    Amongst  its  findings,  the  Tax  Chamber  declined  to   accept   the
    Appellant's evidence, at least in  part  (��51,  59);  found  that  the
    Appellant had control of A Cars and that the evidence was indicative of
    low level motor vehicle transactions and possible money  laundering  in
    the 2007 and 2008 accounts of A Cars (��84 to 86); that  the  Appellant
    had income from rents from a factory in Istanbul and  rents  from  [the
    property at 52], and director's remuneration and a dividend from A Cars
    (��108 and 109); and found that there was one transaction, in an amount
    of �20,000, which was unexplained and suspicious (even if  it  had  not
    produced taxable income for the wife) (��228, 231  and  96,  97,  111).
    Finally, the Tax Chamber found that the Appellant  and  his  wife  were
    able to meet the mortgage payments, because they received money "from a
    number of sources", concluding that the Appellant "may well  have  been
    in receipt of other funds that could have been given to [his  wife]  to
    fund the expenses" (��231 and 232).

Conclusion on hidden wealth

63. We consider that the Tax Chamber judgment does not  take  matters  much
    further, one way or the other; although it does provide further support
    for the conclusion that A Cars was involved in  money  laundering  (see
    FTT �130).  There remain contradictions and unanswered questions  about
    the Appellant's financial position.   We uphold the FTT's findings that
    the Appellant has not adequately explained his business dealings or the
    position of A Cars.  On the other hand, there is evidence of legitimate
    income.   We  are  not  therefore  satisfied,   on   the   balance   of
    probabilities, that the Appellant has hidden his  wealth.  Nevertheless
    the  Appellant's  lack  of  transparency  with  the  Tribunal  and  his
    inability to explain things does provide some, albeit, limited  support
    for the Secretary of State's case that he was the head of the OCG.


64. However, as set out below, we consider that the other findings of  fact
    do establish that he was head of the OCG, and the evidence and findings
    relating to his financial position do not undermine or contradict those
    findings.

The Appellant's relationship with B

65. The Appellant's relationship with B is addressed at FTT  ��149  to  152
    and then at UT ��91 to 96.  The FTT concluded that B was not acting  as
    the Appellant's "subordinate".  We found (�91) that this was a  crucial
    step in the FTT reaching its conclusion  that  the  Appellant  was  not
    proven to be the head of the OCG.  We then  pointed  out  (at  UT  �92)
    that, nevertheless, the FTT had made a number of specific and  detailed
    findings in relation to B and  his  relationship  with  the  Appellant,
    including that B acted "subserviently" to the Appellant  and  that  the
    close association was "troubling".


66. We went on to find (UT ��93 to 96) that the FTT had made  a  series  of
    errors of law, in its analysis  of  the  evidence:  it  had  failed  to
    resolve an issue of fact (as to how the association between the two men
    did arise); it  had  failed  to  aggregate  those  specific  individual
    findings;  it  had  failed  to  have  regard  to  the  Appellant's  own
    admissions about the term "Abi" and failed to make a finding as to  who
    was being referred to by that term; and it applied the  wrong  standard
    of proof in relation to those conversations.

67. Mr O'Callaghan made no additional submissions directed specifically  to
    the overall relationship between the Appellant and B.  Nor did he  seek
    to dispute the FTT's findings, which we summarised at UT �92.

68. In reaching its final conclusion at �152,  the  FTT  put  forward  four
    reasons.  As regards the first reason, we do not consider that the fact
    that the Appellant was not prosecuted in relation to  the  kidnap  plot
    takes the matter much further; that related to one particular  incident
    only.  As regards the third reason, we have addressed the fact that the
    Appellant had not given an order  to  retaliate  for  the  shooting  in
    paragraph 54 above.  As to the final reason -  the  limited  number  of
    examples, within the probe material, of orders being given  -  this  is
    not a basis for not  taking  into  account  those  passages  which  are
    contained within the probe material which do demonstrate or  support  a
    finding that the Appellant was the head of the OCG.

Drugs

69. The FTT's second reason for concluding that B was not  the  Appellant's
    subordinate was that it was reasonably clear that B recognised that the
    Appellant did not approve of drugs  dealing.  This  was  based  on  the
    transcript of the conversation of 7 January 2014 where B said  that  he
    did not say anything to "Abi" in relation to that type of business; the
    Appellant did not even want to hear about it.  Partly in reliance  upon
    this evidence,  the  FTT  held  that  after  the  imprisonment  of  the
    Appellant's brothers, the A OCG probably ceased to engage in the  drugs
    trade: FTT �146.  The fact that the Tax Chamber Judgment  recorded  (at
    �15) that in 2013 the NCA conducted an investigation into Class A  drug
    trafficking by the A OCG is  not  necessarily  inconsistent  with  that
    finding by the FTT, nor does it establish  that  the  Appellant  cannot
    have been head of the OCG.


70. Mr O'Callaghan's further argument was that this  evidence  demonstrated
    that B was  involved  in  other  criminal  activity  other  than  as  a
    subordinate to the Appellant, and that because there was  invariably  a
    hierarchy of supply in the drugs trade, B was also working for  others,
    and thus could not be the Appellant's subordinate.

71. We do not accept this reasoning.  As Mr Hall submitted, the drugs trade
    will involve a supply chain, but not necessarily a hierarchy.   As  the
    FTT found (FTT ��48, 60) there was no suggestion that B had a second or
    other "boss".  The fact that he kept his  drugs  involvement  from  the
    Appellant does not undermine a  finding  that  he  was  acting  as  the
    Appellant's subordinate.  Indeed, the passage  in  question  is  a  yet
    further reference to the Appellant as "Abi", and the fact that he  goes
    out of the way to say that he withholds certain information from  "Abi"
    implies that otherwise there is an expectation that he would  tell  him
    about other types of business.

Conclusion on the Appellant's relationship with B

72. In our judgment, the detailed factual findings of the  FTT,  summarised
    at UT �92, are strong evidence that not only did B act subserviently to
    the Appellant in his "troubling" and "close" association with him,  but
    further that B was indeed the Appellant's subordinate  within  an  OCG.
    These  findings  call  for  a  response.   However,  not  only  did  Mr
    O'Callaghan not make any additional submissions in  response,  but  the
    Appellant had not put forward any alternative explanation for his close
    association and involvement with B.


73. We find that B, a violent career criminal  and  drug  dealer,  was  the
    Appellant's  subordinate.   This  supports  the  conclusion  that   the
    Appellant was head of the OCG.

Prison visits

74. The FTT found that during the time that the Appellant was  remanded  in
    custody at HMP Belmarsh, he was visited  by  a  substantial  number  of
    individuals, many of whom have criminal records.  Some of the  offences
    of the visitors were very serious.  The FTT found that the  implication
    of this was that the Appellant has a large  number  of  associates  who
    commit, in some cases, very serious crime:  see FTT �142.   However  at
    �143 the FTT could not infer from those visits that the  Appellant  was
    running the OCG "from inside HMP Belmarsh".  The FTT went  on  to  find
    that it could not say that this took the matter very far  in  terms  of
    establishing that the Appellant was head of the OCG.


75. Nevertheless, and leaving to one side the question of whether,  at  the
    time, he was running the OCG from prison, we consider that this is,  at
    the least, further evidence of the Appellant having close  associations
    with a substantial number of people with criminal records, some of whom
    had been involved in very serious crime (see FTT �149).  Whilst not  of
    itself conclusive evidence of the Appellant's position as head  of  the
    OCG, it is entirely consistent with the other strands of evidence which
    support that conclusion.


Conclusions on serious grounds of public policy or public security

76. We find as follows:


    (1)  The A OCG existed in the past, at least up to and including 2014.


    (2)  The Appellant was head of the A OCG.


    (3)  Even if the OCG is no longer operative now (or was  not  operative
         at the time of the decision to deport) the Appellant had, as at the
         time of the  deportation  decision,  and  continues  to  have,  the
         capacity to revive the A OCG.  There is no evidence to  suggest  to
         the contrary.

77. The finding at (2) above is based on our findings, taken  together  and
    cumulatively, in relation to the following matters:


    (1)  The Appellant's security conscious behaviour (paragraph 25 above);


    (2)  The Appellant's behaviour and the content of the  conversation  at
         the meeting with D on 29 January 2014 (paragraph 29 above);


    (3)  The steps taken to trace D in March 2014 (paragraph 30 above);


    (4)  AS's belief that the Appellant was involved in criminal activities
         of the same kind  as  those  of  AB3,  who  had  been  involved  in
         organised crime, probably as head of the OCG (paragraph 32 above);

    (5)  B  referring  to  the  Appellant  the  head  of  the  OCG  in  his
         conversation with E of  13  February  2014  (paragraphs  35  to  37
         above);


    (6)  The conversation between the Appellant and B about  centralisation
         (paragraph 40 above);

    (7)  The references by B in conversations in March 2014 (and in January
         2014) to the Appellant as "Abi"  (paragraphs  44,  48,  49  and  69
         above);


    (8)  The content of, and context  for,  the  Appellant's  conversations
         with B about the Z Road shooting on 23 and 24 March 2014 (paragraph
         55 above);


    (9)  The fact that B , a violent career criminal and drug  dealer,  was
         the Appellant's subordinate. (paragraph 73 above).


78. Further, our findings in relation to hidden wealth  and  prison  visits
    (paragraphs 63 and 75 above),  whilst  not,  of  themselves,  providing
    direct evidence of the Appellant being head of the OCG, are  consistent
    with such a finding.


79. Accordingly, the Appellant's position as head of the OCG  represents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the requirements of
    public policy or public security within the meaning of Regulation 19(3)
    and 21(3).

Regulation 21 and Article 8: justification and proportionality

80. FTT �159 records that the Appellant accepted  that  no  separate  issue
    arose in relation to the protections offered by  Regulation  21(5)  and
    (6) nor in relation to consideration of family life and best  interests
    of the child.  Following the re-making hearing on 20 November 2017, the
    Appellant raised, afresh, matters arising under this rubric.  These are
    addressed in the Confidential Decision.  For reasons  there  given,  we
    conclude that removal is justified and proportionate.


Notice of Decision

The Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision  to  remove
him, dated 16 June 2015, is dismissed.

For the Respondent:    Declan O'Callaghan, instructed by Irving & Co,
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    ("the Secretary of State") against  the  decision  of  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal ("the FTT") promulgated on 7 July 2016  ("the  Decision").  By
    the Decision, the FTT allowed the appeal of A against the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State dated 16 June 2015 to make a  deportation  order
    against him ("the Deportation Order") pursuant to section 5(1)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971.  Whilst A is the respondent to this  appeal,  for
    ease, we refer to him as "the Appellant", as he was before the FTT.  On
    the Appellant's application and the basis of submissions made, we  have
    granted anonymity with a  view  to  protecting  the  interests  of  the
    Appellant's son.

 2. The Appellant is Kurdish and a Turkish national.  Prior to his  arrival
    in the UK in 1994, he had lived in Turkey. In 2002 he married a citizen
    of the Republic of Ireland and was thus  a  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national  and  had  a  residence  card  valid  until  June  2012.   His
    application for naturalisation was ultimately withdrawn in  July  2015.
    It is common ground that as a result of his marriage to an EEA national
    and his period of continuous residence, he  has  acquired  a  permanent
    right  of  residence  under  Regulation  15(1)(b)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations").

The Deportation Order

 3. On 11 February 2015 the Secretary of State served  the  Appellant  with
    notice of liability to deportation pursuant  to  the  EEA  Regulations.
    The reason was because of his "longstanding involvement and  leadership
    role in organised crime".  The Appellant made representations as to why
    he should not be deported.

 4. On 16 June 2015 the Secretary of State made the Deportation Order  with
    an accompanying decision letter ("the decision letter").  The basis  of
    the Deportation Order was that the Appellant was  the  head  of  the  A
    Organised Crime Group ("the OCG"); that he had been involved in serious
    organised crime since at least 1998 and that consequently  his  removal
    from the UK was justified on "serious  grounds  of  public  policy  and
    public security" pursuant to regulations 19(3)(b) and  21  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.   During the period of the Appellant's leadership, the OCG
    engaged in serious organised violence, blackmail and  money-laundering.
    As such, the Appellant represented a genuine, present and  sufficiently
    serious threat to the public to justify  deportation.   In  particular,
    the Secretary of State relied upon the Appellant's relationship with A,
    believed to be the Appellant's "principal  lieutenant"  and  a  violent
    enforcer in  relation  to  his  organised  crime  activities  and  upon
    transcripts of aural probe recordings of  conversations  involving  the
    Appellant and others.  The decision letter  went  on  to  consider  the
    Appellant's relationship with his wife and his son under  the  Zambrano
    principles and Article 8 ECHR and concluded  that  neither  provided  a
    reason not to make the Deportation Order.

The appeal to the FTT

 5. The Appellant appealed to the FTT,  under  regulation  26  of  the  EEA
    Regulations,  against the Deportation decision.  The  hearing  extended
    over four days in April and June  2016.   In  addition  to  substantial
    documentary evidence running to 5 volumes, the FTT heard oral evidence.
      The Secretary of State called XY, an officer of  the  National  Crime
    Agency ("NCA") who gave  oral  evidence  and  whose  witness  statement
    adduced the evidence of the transcripts of the probe recordings.  Those
    recordings, which were at the heart of the Secretary of  State's  case,
    were the result of some three years' surveillance of the activities  of
    the Appellant, B and others in the course of an  NCA  investigation  of
    the  OCG.   XY's  evidence,  based  on  his  extensive  experience  and
    knowledge of organised crime, including Turkish  organised  crime,  and
    upon the probe evidence, was that he believed that the Appellant is now
    the head of the A  OCG.  The FTT also  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    Appellant himself, from his wife, AW and from his sister-in-law, AS who
    is married to one of the Appellant's brothers,  AB3.   The  Appellant's
    case was not only that he was not the leader of the OCG, but  that  the
    OCG did not exist at all (�21).

 6. By the time of closing submissions, it was common ground that the  only
    issue in the appeal was the question of whether or  not  the  Appellant
    was the head of the A OCG.  The Appellant accepted that if, contrary to
    his case, the Secretary of State could establish that he is the head of
    the OCG, then his removal would be justified, regardless of any Article
    8 and Zambrano considerations: see Decision �159.

The Decision in summary

 7. The FTT allowed the Appellant's appeal.  By the Decision, which runs to
    166 paragraphs, the FTT concluded that it was not satisfied that it  is
    more probable than not that the Appellant is the  head  of  the  A  OCG
    (�154). In brief outline:

      1) The FTT held that it was for the Secretary of  State  to  establish
         the facts justifying deportation to the civil standard of proof  of
         a balance of probabilities (�18).

      2) The FTT considered, first, at ��21-37, the issue of whether  the  A
         OCG existed at all, concluding that it did, at least until 2011  or
         that "there has been a [A]  OCG  for  many  years"  (�38).   As  to
         whether it had continued to exist, the  FTT  was  less  clear:  see
         ��34, 37, 38,146, 147, 154.

      3) Then the FTT considered the Appellant's involvement in the OCG.  At
         ��38-143, the FTT considered in  substantial  detail,  and  made  a
         number  of  findings  of  fact  relating  to,  various  strands  of
         evidence, said to be relevant to that question.

      4) At ��144-154, the FTT set out its conclusions  on  the  Appellant's
         involvement in the OCG.  At �149, it found that the  Appellant  had
         many close associations with  people  with  criminal  records,  and
         particularly that he had a close association with B, who  has  very
         serious convictions and  is  a  violent  career  criminal.   As  to
         whether the Appellant was the head of the OCG, the  FTT  considered
         that the most troubling part of the evidence  was  that  concerning
         the Appellant's close association with B.  However,  first,  (�152)
         it  was  unable  to  find  that  B   acted   as   the   Appellant's
         "subordinate". Secondly, (�153), it had not  been  shown  that  the
         Appellant held significant assets and  the  FTT  did  not  find  it
         likely that the Appellant had hidden his wealth  (as  suggested  by
         the Secretary of  State).  The  FTT  was  not  satisfied  that  the
         Appellant  enjoyed  the  lifestyle  which   might   be   considered
         consistent with his being the head of an OCG.  These were  the  two
         essential reasons for the FTT's ultimate conclusion  at  �154  (set
         out above).

This appeal

 8. On 15 August 2016, the Secretary of State applied to this Tribunal  for
    permission to appeal against the  Decision,  contending  that  the  FTT
    erred in law on the basis of three grounds of appeal, namely:

      1) applying the wrong standard of proof, thereby amounting  to  unfair
         procedure;

      2) reaching inconsistent findings on key issues, thereby  constituting
         irrationality;

      3)  failing  properly  to  aggregate  individual  findings  of   fact,
         amounting to a failure to have regard to material evidence.

     On 13 September 2016, Upper Tribunal Judge Ockelton granted  permission
    to appeal on these grounds.

Background facts

 9. The Appellant came to the UK in 1994, aged 21.  He married AW  in  2002
    and his son was born in 2005 and is now aged 11.  In 1995 he  purchased
    a property at [3], title to which remains in the Appellant's name.   In
    2002 he and his wife purchased a property at  [52]  and  in  2007  they
    purchased a property at [56].  Each  of  these  were  bought  with  the
    assistance of a substantial mortgage and title in each  was  originally
    in his wife's name.  AW was subsequently made bankrupt and title to the
    latter two properties is now vested in her trustee in bankruptcy.

The Appellant's older brothers and the A OCG

10. The Appellant has three older brothers, who are all now serving lengthy
    prison sentences.   The  eldest,  AB1,  is  currently  serving  a  life
    sentence imposed in 2001 following his  conviction  for  conspiracy  to
    murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling.  The second,  AB2,  successfully
    appealed against a  conviction,  and  was  acquitted  on  retrial,  for
    offences of heroin trafficking, conspiracy to blackmail and  perverting
    the course of justice.  Subsequently he was excluded from  the  UK  and
    returned to Turkey.  He is currently in prison in Turkey in relation to
    the seizure of a very large amount of cocaine.  The third brother,  AB3
    was sentenced to 30  years'  imprisonment  in  October  2011  following
    convictions involving drug smuggling and money-laundering.  His  appeal
    to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful.  Lord Thomas LCJ found that he
    had engaged in extensive travel to South America in connection with the
    drugs conspiracy.  The trial judge had been entitled to  conclude  that
    AB3 was near the top of the supply chain and distribution organisation.



11. The FTT found (and it  is  not  disputed)  that  historically  the  OCG
    existed and that, at least, AB1 had formerly led it (�57).  It  further
    found that there was logic in XY's suggestion that each  of  the  three
    older brothers had been, in turn, the head of the OCG (�33).

Others involved and the NCA investigation and probe evidence

12. Others relevant to the events in  question  included  in  particular  B
    said to be high up in the OCG (see paragraph 7(4)  above);  C,  a  more
    junior member of the OCG and a frequent associate of B; E,  F;  and  D,
    who was operating an alcohol warehouse business in Bournemouth and said
    to be working for and on behalf of the Appellant.

13. The NCA had been investigating the activities of B  and  the  Appellant
    over a number of years and covert listening devices were deployed  both
    in vehicles used by B and  at  [the  property  at  52].   These  probes
    recorded a large number of conversations and the transcripts of some of
    these were  given  in  evidence  by  XY.   For  present  purposes,  the
    Secretary of State relied  upon  a  number  of  recorded  conversations
    involving B  and C, B  and the Appellant and between B, the  Appellant,
    and D as well as others.  The principal conversations relied upon  took
    place between January and March 2014.

D: meeting on 29 January 2014 and flight abroad in March 2014

14. In particular on 29 January 2014, a meeting took place at D's warehouse
    in Bournemouth, during which the Appellant, in the somewhat understated
    words of the FTT (�51) "vented his spleen in no uncertain  terms  on  D
    over matters which had gone wrong with the running  of  the  business".
    B, who had no connection with the  D  drinks  business,  attended  this
    meeting.

15. On 3 March 2014, there was an attempt to kidnap D and on the next day D
    fled abroad.  In the days  that  immediately  followed,  there  were  a
    number of relevant conversations between B and C recorded in B's car.

Shooting at Z Road on 23 May 2014

16. On the evening of 23 May 2014, there was a shooting incident in Z  Road
    in [an] area of North London.  It  involved  one  G  firing  into  shop
    premises.  As he ran off, he exchanged  fire  with  an  undercover  NCA
    officer. C was present at the shop premises.  XY said that the premises
    were used  by  members  of  the  OCG  and  that  the  shooting  was  in
    retaliation for a confrontation between C and others the day before.  G
    was arrested and subsequently tried and  convicted  of  an  offence  of
    endangering life (the original charge had been attempted murder).    On
    that  evening  and  the  following  day,  24  May  2014,   there   were
    conversations, recorded on the probe, between B and the  Appellant,  in
    which the shooting was discussed.  The content of  these  conversations
    formed an important part of the Secretary of State's case.

The Appellant and others charged and tried June 2014 to January 2015

17. In June 2014, the Appellant was arrested and charged with  offences  of
    conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to blackmail and conspiracy to  commit
    grievous bodily harm, all arising in connection with  events  in  March
    surrounding D.  His co-defendants included B, C  and  three  others.  B
    pleaded guilty in  November  2014  and  was  sentenced  to  8  �  years
    imprisonment for conspiracy to commit GBH and conspiracy to  blackmail.
    One other defendant pleaded guilty.  As regards the Appellant,  he  was
    tried only on the count of conspiracy to blackmail  at  Woolwich  Crown
    Court in January 2015.  The jury failed to  reach  a  verdict  on  that
    count.  Other defendants who were tried were also acquitted.

The Decision in more detail

18. The Secretary of State's case before  the  FTT,  and  on  this  appeal,
    proceeds in three steps: first, that  the  OCG  had  existed  for  many
    years; secondly, that the Appellant is closely associated with a number
    of individuals with convictions for serious criminal offences,  and  in
    particular B; and thirdly that the Appellant is the head of the OCG.

19. The Decision considered the factual issues under two heads: first,  the
    existence of the OCG and secondly, the Appellant's involvement  in  the
    OCG.  In this context, it is noteworthy that the question which the FTT
    asked itself was whether it was satisfied that the Appellant "currently
    leads the A OCG or has the capability to revive  it"  (�41).   On  this
    basis, it appears not to have been critical to its decision that it was
    clear that the OCG existed at that time - only that it had  existed  in
    the past and that it could be revived.

The existence of the A OCG

20. As regards the first step, the existence of  the  OCG,  the  FTT  found
    clearly that "there has been" a A OCG (or that the A OCG "has existed")
    for many years (��23, 37, 38, 146, 154, first sentence) and that it had
    existed "at least until 2011" (�34).  It also  rejected,  in  trenchant
    terms, the Appellant's denials of its existence. The Appellant did  not
    adequately address the evidence confirming the existence  of  the  OCG.
    (��23, 33, 38). Further it accepted that there was a connection between
    the three older brothers, all of whom  had  been  involved  in  serious
    organised crime.

21. The Decision is less clear in its findings as to whether, at  the  time
    of the Decision, the OCG still existed.  The FTT found this a "far more
    difficult question to answer" (�147).  It certainly did not  find  that
    the OCG no longer existed (see the use of the  tense  "has  been").  It
    found that since 2011 it had probably ceased to  engage  in  the  drugs
    trade (perhaps implying its continued existence) (�146).  G's  evidence
    that the shooting in May 2014 was related to the A OCG, whilst  not  of
    itself of great weight, corroborated XY's evidence as to the  existence
    of the OCG (�37). There was evidence to show that it existed, which the
    Appellant could not explain convincingly, but that  evidence  did  "not
    necessarily show there was an  active  [A]  OCG".   The  FTT  concluded
    (�147) that "we have kept an open mind about the possibility  that  the
    [A] OCG continues to  exist  in  some  reduced  form".   In  its  final
    conclusion (�154), the FTT found "there may still be a reduced  version
    of that organisation in existence".

The Appellant's involvement in the OCG

22. As regards the Appellant's involvement in the OCG, in the Decision, the
    FTT considered, in turn, evidence relating to  a  number  of  different
    issues.  For the purposes of  this  appeal,  the  issues  included  the
    following:

      1) The Appellant's place in the hierarchy of the OCG
      2) The Z Road shooting
      3) Security conscious behaviour
      4) D
      5) The Appellant's financial and business position
      6) Evidence from AS.

(1)  The Appellant's place in the hierarchy of the OCG

23. In this context, the Secretary  of  State  relied  upon  four  recorded
    conversations.

24. The FTT first considered two conversations between B and C on 7 and  10
    March 2014, in which someone called "abi" was referred to as  paying  B
    and as giving him directions.  The Appellant  had  accepted  in  cross-
    examination that B might have been referring to him (��44 and 48).   In
    respect of both conversations, the FTT concluded that whilst they might
    support the Secretary of State's case, it could not be said that  there
    were no other possible interpretations of the conversations  (��46  and
    51). Overall they  did  not  go  very  far  in  establishing  that  the
    Appellant was the head of an OCG.  These passages are  relevant,  inter
    alia, to Ground 1, the standard of proof.

25. The third conversation was B and E discussing what might happen if  AB1
    came back.  In that conversation, B stated  "I  started  this  business
    with "A abi", I will finish it with "A abi" ... there isn't any other."
      XY's evidence was that that conversation was expressly referring to a
    power struggle between the two brothers if AB1 did come  back.   Having
    rejected the Appellant's alternative explanation of this  conversation,
    the FTT  found  that  it  was  "clear"  that  the  pair  probably  were
    discussing  the  Appellant's  brother  and  further  found   that   the
    conversation "links the Appellant directly to  the  organisation  which
    [AB1]... formerly led" (�57).  As explained below, this is an important
    finding made by the FTT.

26. The fourth conversation was the Appellant discussing  with  B  what  XY
    termed "the  structure  of  the  OCG",  in  which  the  Appellant  made
    references to a centralised system and  him  being  distanced  from  it
    (�58).  At ��59 and 60, the FTT rejected  the  Appellant's  alternative
    explanation for this conversation. However, at �61, it concluded


      "Nonetheless, we find  we  can  only  place  limited  weight  on  this
      evidence.  Whilst the appellant's explanation was unsatisfactory,  the
      extract  is  not  sufficiently  clear  that  we  can  find  no   other
      interpretations are possible other than XY's belief that it shows  the
      appellant giving orders as to how the OCG should be arranged so as  to
      ensure nothing that happened was  attributable  to  him"     (emphasis
      added)


27. In conclusion in this section, (at ��62 and 63) the FTT found that "the
    Appellant has close associations with [B] and [C]".  It also found that
    the evidence supported the notion that B and C respected the  Appellant
    and took advice from him.  However it  was  unable  to  say  that  this
    advice - or even direction - was more likely than not  attributable  to
    the Appellant being the head of an OCG.  The Appellant had gained  some
    "notoriety" from his family  name  which  he  probably  used  to  exert
    influence.  But there was a wide gap between  that  and  the  Appellant
    currently heading an OCG.

(2)  The Z Road shooting

28. There were two recorded conversations, in B's armoured car, between the
    Appellant and B on 23 and 24 May 2014 in which the news of the  Z  Road
    shooting  was  passed  on  to  the  Appellant  and  the  Appellant  was
    interested in the fact that the NCA officers were at  the  scene.   The
    Appellant accepted that he knew that B's car was armoured, that  B  had
    been shot at and  that  he  knew  people  who  had  guns  (�70).   XY's
    interpretation of the conversation was that the Appellant told  B  that
    retaliatory action could be taken against those who  had  attacked  the
    shop. In his evidence XY characterised  this  as  "permission"  (rather
    than an order) to retaliate.

29. At �74, the FTT stated:

      "It was put to XY in cross-examination that there was no  evidence  of
      any retaliation being taken for the shooting ... .  The implication of
      this line of questioning was  that  the  absence  of  retaliation  was
      inconsistent with there being  a  [A]  OCG.   However,  that  argument
      assumes that G was also a gang member.  Moreover ... G was arrested at
      the scene and there was therefore no opportunity to  take  retaliatory
      action against him. ... In the  circumstances,  we  do  not  draw  any
      inference from the failure of the OCG to  retaliate.  ..."   (emphasis
      added)

     Then at �77, the FTT concluded as follows:

      "... we note that the appellant was given news of the  shooting  early
      on and his interest in it was not amusement.  It is curious  that  the
      appellant was told about the  incident  so  soon  after  it  happened.
      However the imputation that the appellant then issued instructions  to
      retaliate is not clearly borne out by the  transcripts.   Furthermore,
      given there is no evidence  of  any  retaliation  taking  place,  XY's
      depiction of the appellant as the head of a ruthless OCG  prepared  to
      use lethal violence does not gain much  support  from  this  evidence"
      (emphasis added)

     This issue is picked up again at �152 (see paragraph 40 below).

(3)  Security conscious behaviour

30. The Secretary of State relied upon two conversations said  to  evidence
    "security-conscious" behaviour on the part of the Appellant.  As to the
    first, the FTT did not attach much significance to the evidence of  the
    Appellant conducting meetings  at  or  in  front  of  a  barber's  shop
    premises, although it could not understand why the Appellant  would  be
    holding a large amount of cash belonging to the barber  (�79).   As  to
    the second, a conversation between the Appellant and B  discussing  the
    possibility of a listening device having been installed in B's car,  at
    �82, the FTT found that it was difficult to interpret this "as  nothing
    more than innocent banter", but nevertheless did not consider that  the
    extract contained clear evidence of the Appellant operating as the head
    of an OCG.

(4)  D

31. The FTT found (at �88) that not only B and C  were  extremely  keen  to
    find D to bring him back to the UK (neither were partners in the drinks
    business), but also that  it  was  more  probable  than  not  that  the
    Appellant was seeking to trace him and "then to find a way to encounter
    him".  Taking account of the "severe roasting" and  "highly  offensive,
    demeaning and provocative language" at the meeting on 29 January  2014,
    the FTT considered it "more probable  than  not  that  the  Appellant's
    intentions went beyond having an ordinary business meeting" with D.

32. However, the FTT concluded that, whatever  the  Appellant's  intentions
    when he finally met D, it could not say that "this evidence can only be
    interpreted as demonstrating the existence  of  an  OCG".   Whilst  the
    Appellant plainly used extreme verbal  intimidation  and  enlisted  the
    support of unsavoury characters, to force D to  change  his  behaviour,
    the means deployed to try to get hold of him could not be described  as
    sophisticated.  The evidence did not show that the steps taken to trace
    D "demonstrate the existence of an OCG".

(5)  The Appellant's financial and business position

33. At ��91-115, the FTT considered  the  Appellant's  financial  position.
    The Secretary of State's case was that the Appellant was a wealthy man,
    derived from his position as head of the OCG, and that  he  had  hidden
    that wealth.  This involved considering the source of very  substantial
    mortgage repayments on the two properties in the name of his wife.   At
    �104, the FTT found that there was considerable  doubt  as  to  whether
    [the property at 52] was rented out such  that  the  considerable  cash
    mortgage repayments could be accounted for.  On the other hand,  whilst
    the Appellant obviously enjoyed respect among members of the community,
    the Secretary of State had not shown that the Appellant was  a  wealthy
    man (�109).   At �110, the FTT "did not find the evidence  suggests  it
    is more probable than not that the Appellant has hidden his wealth".

34. At ��111-112 the FTT went on, however, to  express  concern  about  the
    Appellant's business activities.  His evidence that  his  finances  had
    gone downhill since 2009 was inconsistent with  his  account  of  being
    able to secure large amounts of credit on nothing more than  his  word.
    The FTT drew the inference that he had presented an incomplete  picture
    of his business dealings.  At �114, the FTT went further and found that
    it was clear to it that the Appellant was not prepared  to  provide  an
    accurate picture of his circumstances. At �115, the  FTT  concluded  as
    follows:

      "We have carefully considered whether these findings should lead us to
      conclude that the appellant might be hiding his  wealth.  However,  on
      balance, we have concluded that they do not"

     It found  it  likely  that  the  Appellant  benefited  from  a  certain
    notoriety which enabled him to  make  connections  within  the  Kurdish
    community and that that might account  for  his  ability  to  guarantee
    credit whilst not having any capital assets to provide security.

35. In relation to A Cars Ltd, the Appellant's claimed car business,  there
    was  a  similar  degree  of  opacity  to  his  evidence  regarding  its
    operations. The FTT concluded (at �130) that A Cars Ltd does operate in
    a legitimate manner, but that it only "ticks over" and it had not  been
    adequately explained why that should be the case.  Again, the  FTT  was
    "sure the appellant has not provided a complete or accurate account  of
    his activities".  However it was not able to find  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that it was being used to launder money.  At its highest,
    the evidence showed that the  Appellant  operated  on  the  fringes  of
    legality, rather than that he used the business to provide him  with  a
    cloak of legitimacy whilst he operated as head of an OCG.

(6)  Evidence from AS

36. XY relied upon a recorded conversation between AS and B on 12  February
    2014 as showing that they  were  discussing  the  Appellant's  criminal
    activities.  B refers to the possibility of the Appellant being put  in
    prison, and AS responds "Unless he and AB3 change their lifestyle  they
    will have problems again".  In oral evidence, AS  gave  an  alternative
    interpretation of the conversation.  At �137 the FTT found her evidence
    highly evasive and rejected her explanation.  It  continued  "We  infer
    from her refusal to explain what she had meant that her  concerns  were
    that the appellant would end up  in  prison  because  of  his  criminal
    activities".

The conclusions

37. At ��144-154, the FTT set outs its conclusions,  by  reference  to  the
    three steps identified in paragraph 18 above.   As  regards  the  first
    step, the existence of the OCG, we have already referred, at  paragraph
    20 above, to the FTT's conclusions.

38. As regards the second step, the FTT concluded at �149:

      "We find as a fact that the appellant has many close associations with
      people with criminal records... We place particular  reliance  on  his
      close association with [B], who  has  very  serious  convictions.   We
      noted that the appellant was in a car with [B] on  the  night  of  the
      shooting and also the next day.  We do not  accept  that  they  simply
      knew  each  other  through  the  community  or  through  their   joint
      participation in the car trade.  The  recorded  conversations  between
      [B] and [AS] and also [B] and [C]  indicate  that  there  is  a  close
      association between the appellant and [B], even though, as far  as  we
      can see, [B] was not involved with the  Bournemouth  enterprise.   The
      appellant's claim to have  broken  off  relations  with  [B]  when  he
      realised what he had done appeared to us to be  highly  contrived.  We
      accept XY's depiction of [B] as a violent career  criminal.  We  noted
      the appellant's admission that [B] used  the  [A]  name."    (emphasis
      added)

39. As regards the third step, the FTT addressed the  question  of  whether
    the Appellant was the head of the OCG by reference to two  issues:  (1)
    the Appellant's relationship with B and (2) whether the  Appellant  has
    significant assets which he had hidden.

40. As to (1), the FTT found at �152:

      "In our judgment, the most troubling part of the evidence concerns the
      appellant's close association with [B], who is  known  to  be  a  loan
      shark and drug dealer. He uses an armoured car.  He moved house  after
      being shot at.  He is now serving a lengthy sentence.  Mr  O'Callaghan
      described the appellant's relationship with [B] as  the  "fulcrum"  of
      the respondent's case.  We agree it is a central part of it.  However,
      as said, the respondent's case only succeeds if it is shown  that  [B]
      acts as the appellant's subordinate.  For the reasons  given,  we  are
      unable to find that is the case.   [B]  certainly  acts  subserviently
      towards the appellant and talks about him to others  as  if  he  holds
      authority within the community.  However it is telling  that  the  CPS
      did not find there was sufficient evidence to prosecute the  appellant
      in connection with the kidnap plot.  It is also reasonably clear  that
      [B] recognises the appellant does not approve  of  drugs  dealing.  We
      have found the probe evidence does not show with probability that  the
      appellant was giving order to exact revenge following the shooting. If
      he did, the unanswered question arises of why  no  retaliatory  action
      was taken. Again, if there  were  a  chain  of  command  of  the  kind
      described  by  XY,  we  consider  it  is  likely  that  three   years'
      surveillance would have revealed far more in the way  of  examples  of
      orders being given and reported on."

41. As to (2), at �153, the FTT concluded that it had not been  shown  that
    the Appellant held significant assets, repeating its finding that "they
    did not find it is likely that the Appellant  had  successfully  hidden
    his wealth".  A Cars Ltd was plainly not the Appellant's main means  of
    supporting himself and his family.  It had only been  given  a  partial
    insight into his many business arrangements and the Appellant  had  not
    given truthful evidence about his precise circumstances.   However  the
    FTT was not satisfied by the evidence that he enjoyed a lifestyle which
    might be considered consistent with his being the head of an OCG.

The Parties' submissions

(1)  The Secretary of State's case

42. The Secretary of State submits that the FTT committed  three  different
    types of error of law, as set out in paragraph 8  above.   Accordingly,
    the Decision should be set aside for error of  law  and  this  Tribunal
    should proceed immediately to remake the decision  and,  on  the  clear
    evidence before us, proceed to make a finding that  the  Appellant  was
    the head of the A OCG.

43. She makes the overarching point that she  provided  the  only  credible
    evidence in the case.  By contrast, the Appellant's evidence to the FTT
    was not truthful and, at numerous junctures, was rejected by  the  FTT,
    leading to a general conclusion that he was not  credible.   Similarly,
    the FTT found AS not to be a witness of truth.  By contrast, Officer XY
    was found to be a reliable witness whose evidence was fair.

44. As regards ground 1 (standard of proof), although the FTT  stated  that
    it was applying the civil standard of proof,  the  Secretary  of  State
    submits that it is plain from a reading of its findings of  fact  that,
    in respect of individual issues of fact, it did not do so.  In practice
    the FTT wrongly applied a higher standard of requiring the Secretary of
    State to establish that there were no alternative explanations for  the
    Appellant's  conduct;   on  occasions,  this  approached  the  criminal
    standard, namely asking whether there was any reasonable  doubt  as  to
    the Secretary of State's case.  The Secretary of State  identifies  six
    different instances in the Decision where the FTT applied  this  higher
    standard of proof.  In particular, this error was made  in  respect  of
    the references to  "abi"  in  the  two  conversations  in  March  2014.
    Further the FTT's reliance upon police and NCA investigations which did
    not lead to any adverse conclusions  was  misplaced,  since  those  all
    require the criminal standard of proof to be satisfied: see ��89,  130.
    Indeed this supports the view that the FTT was approaching the standard
    of proof incorrectly.

45. In this connection, the Secretary  of  State  submits  that  the  FTT's
    approach to the evidence of Officer XY was inconsistent and wrong.  The
    FTT was wrong to seek corroboration of  XY's  evidence  -  it  was  not
    required.  The FTT accepted that XY had the ability  to  interpret  the
    evidence, but (at ��46, 62) failed to follow its own direction.

46. As regards ground 2, there are a number of instances  in  the  Decision
    where the FTT reaches internally inconsistent findings of  fact.   This
    means that the FTT failed to deal with the evidence before it and as  a
    result the Decision is irrational and/or perverse.   The  Secretary  of
    State identifies, in the first place, three particular examples of such
    inconsistent findings.  First, there are contradictory findings  (��74,
    77 and 152) in relation to the significance, if any, of the failure  of
    the OCG to retaliate following the Z road shooting incident.  Secondly,
    the direct finding that the Appellant was clearly involved with the OCG
    and that B and E were discussing a  future  potential  power  struggle,
    between the Appellant and his brother AB1, over the leadership  of  the
    OCG (�57) (and also �63) was inconsistent with the ultimate  conclusion
    that he was not the head of the OCG (see �62 last sentence  and  �154).
    Thirdly, on the one hand, the FTT concluded that the Appellant had  not
    been prepared to give an accurate picture of  his  financial  position,
    and yet on the other hand, it found that the evidence did not lead  the
    FTT to conclude that the Appellant "might be hiding his wealth".

47. As regards Ground 3, the FTT failed to aggregate its  various  findings
    on the different strands of activity, and thus failed to have regard to
    material evidence.   For  example,  having  found  that  the  Appellant
    enlisted the support of unsavoury characters, such as B and  C  in  his
    efforts to force D to change his behaviour, the FTT did not  go  on  to
    consider why he did this (��88, 89).  It should  have  considered  this
    together with other evidence and/or findings where  the  Appellant  was
    giving directions to B and C,  his  ability  to  guarantee  credit  for
    international suppliers, with his travelling in B's  armoured  car  and
    his acquaintance with people who had guns.  The duty of the FTT was  to
    consider whether the totality of  the  evidence,  when  judged  in  the
    round, demonstrated that the public policy and public security  grounds
    were made out.

48. Further, the FTT failed to reach  conclusions  on  the  evidence.   For
    example, having found that it was curious that the Appellant  had  been
    informed of the Z Road shooting so  soon  after  it  had  happened,  it
    failed to consider why the  Appellant  was  informed.  Further,  having
    found that the Appellant was closely associated with B  and  that  that
    was troubling, the FTT did not go on to consider what other explanation
    there might have been for that relationship other than his position  as
    head of the OCG.   Having  found  (�137)  that  AS  believed  that  the
    Appellant was involved in criminal activities, the FTT did not go on to
    consider or enquire what  those  criminal  activities  were.   In  this
    regard, the FTT wrongly resolved the appeal by reference to the  burden
    of proof alone rather than evaluating the evidence  and  reaching  firm
    conclusions.

The Appellant's case

49. The Appellant submits that the Secretary of State's case amounts to  no
    more than disagreement with findings of fact, which were reasonably and
    lawfully made.  These disagreements do not amount to errors of law.  It
    is a challenge of fact, dressed up as a challenge of law. This Tribunal
    should not engage in a microscopic search for error, and  any  specific
    errors identified by the Secretary of State are not material errors  of
    law.

50. The Secretary of State's case is based centrally on the probe evidence.
    The limited amount of probe evidence relied upon has to be seen in  the
    context of many hours of recordings made over three years.   Yet  those
    recordings contained  no  direct  evidence  of  the  Appellant  issuing
    commands  or  criminality,  which  would  have  been  expected  if  the
    Appellant had been head of the OCG.

51.  Moreover,  the  evidence  before  the  FTT,  in  particular  the  same
    surveillance evidence, had been considered by  other  authorities;  yet
    this has not resulted in any finding  adverse  to  the  Appellant.  The
    Appellant has not been convicted of any criminal offence and despite  a
    lengthy investigation in relation to money laundering and  proceeds  of
    crime, no further action was taken.  In  relation  to  the  prosecution
    concerning D, the prosecution did not  proceed  against  the  Appellant
    with charges relating to kidnap or GBH.  It is not in  issue  that  the
    Appellant had been found not guilty at that  trial,  at  which  it  was
    never alleged that he was involved in an OCG.  (We note that,  at  �90,
    the  FTT  gave  little  weight  to  this  contention).   Further,   the
    prosecution of B was not based upon the kidnapping or GBH  having  been
    ordered by the Appellant.

52. As regards B, there  is  evidence  that  he  was  engaged  in  criminal
    activities other than on the  Appellant's  instructions  and  thus  the
    premise of the Secretary of State's case falls away.  There were others
    who were "abi".

53. The Appellant's evidence was accepted by the FTT on the core issues, in
    particular that he did not enjoy the proceeds of crime, that he was  in
    debt, that he had taken out loans, that he did not hold title  to  [the
    property at 3] and that he ran a car business.  The adverse credibility
    findings were on peripheral issues only.  As  regards  AS,  her  belief
    does not establish that  the  Appellant  was  head  of  the  OCG.   The
    criminality was business notoriety.  There are many instances where the
    FTT did not accept XY's  evidence,  particularly  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's financial and property position.  The jury did not  believe
    G.

54. As regards Ground 1, the passages in the Decision relied  upon  by  the
    Secretary of State do not establish that  the  FTT  applied  the  wrong
    standard of proof.  For example, the other interpretation in  paragraph
    61 is that the Appellant was a businessman who trades on his notoriety,
    and makes money out of using his name  and  introducing  people.   This
    does not amount to being head of an OCG.  XY was not  involved  in  the
    making of the probe recordings and his evidence cannot be determinative
    of the appeal.  As regards corroboration of his evidence, the  FTT  was
    correct to require evidence to substantiate what was "XY's belief". The
    FTT had to do its own assessment of XY's evidence and its  approach  at
    �46 was correct.

55. As  regards  Ground  2,  upon  detailed  consideration,  the  suggested
    inconsistencies  are  not  inconsistencies  at  all.    There   is   no
    inconsistency between �74 and �77 of the Decision.  The Tribunal  found
    that there was no retaliation for the Z Road shooting and no order  for
    any such retaliation and thus that this did not assist in  establishing
    that the Appellant was head of an OCG.  As to �57  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant may have had some involvement with the OCG and  a  link  with
    his brother, is not sufficient to establish that he  was  the  head  of
    such an OCG.  As regards hidden wealth, the FTT's finding was  properly
    based, in part, upon the conclusion of the police investigation.

56. As regards ground 3, first, the FTT was  not  satisfied  that  the  OCG
    continued  after  2011.  Secondly,  the  findings  of  the  Appellant's
    friendship with B and his discussion of the shooting do  not  establish
    the Appellant's involvement in the OCG.  The particular findings relied
    upon by the Secretary of State do not add up to "command and  control".
    The Appellant's notoriety was linked to the fact that  the  family  was
    well-known in the Kurdish region.  Being well-known  in  the  community
    does not mean that they were involved in criminal activities.  Even  if
    some of the Appellant's activities were  "dodgy"  and  not  necessarily
    legitimate, this is not the same as being head of  an  OCG.    The  FTT
    carefully considered and analysed all the evidence, and considered,  in
    respect of each item, whether or not it established that the  Appellant
    was the head of the OCG. It then considered the evidence in the  round,
    asked itself the correct question  applying  the  correct  standard  of
    proof and found that the Secretary of State had not made out her  case.
    If and in so far as the FTT resorted to the burden of proof  to  decide
    the  issues,  it  was  entitled  and  correct  to  do  so.    The   FTT
    appropriately considered and weighed all  the  evidence  and  concluded
    that, ultimately, it did not establish that the Appellant was the  head
    of the OCG.

57. Finally in any event, any errors of law were not material; the Tribunal
    would still have come  to  the  same  conclusion.   On  any  view,  the
    Secretary of State's evidence does not establish that the Appellant  is
    head of the OCG.

Relevant legal background

Foreign nationals: The right to residence and the power to deport

58. The relevant provisions of the EEA Regulations are set out at ��155 and
    156 of the Decision.  In summary, under regulation  19(2)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations, an EEA national or a family member of an EEA national  may
    be removed from the United  Kingdom  if  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    decided that the removal is justified  on  grounds  of  public  policy,
    public security or public health in accordance with the  provisions  of
    regulation 21.  Regulation 21 sets out a number of principles governing
    such removal decisions, particularly where the decision is  on  grounds
    of public policy or public security.  In particular the  decision  must
    be based on the personal conduct of the  person  concerned  which  must
    represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of society: regulation  21(5)  and  in
    particular  regulation  21(5)(c).   However,  where  a  person  has   a
    permanent right of residence  under  regulation  15,  regulation  21(3)
    provides for a special rule, namely that he cannot be removed except on
    serious grounds of public policy or public security.  Under  regulation
    15(1)(b) a family member of an EEA national who is not himself  an  EEA
    national but who has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  the  EEA
    national for a continuous period for five years has  such  a  permanent
    right of residence.

Error of law

59. Appeal to this Tribunal from a determination of the FTT  under  section
    11(2) Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 lies on a point of  law
    only: see rule 24(5) Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules
    2005. The appellant must show that there was an error  of  law  on  the
    part of the FTT in its determination.

60. We have been referred to a number of authorities on what  might  amount
    to a relevant error of law  for  these  purposes:  Edwards  v  Bairstow
    [1956] AC 14; R(Iran) and others v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982 at �9 per Brooke LJ; Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department v Nixon [2014] UKUT 00368 (IAC);  Das  Gupta  v
    Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi [2016] UKUT 00028 (IAC) at �17 .  In
    summary, the following are  the  types  of  error  of  law,  which  are
    particularly relevant to the present appeal:

      1) failure to have regard to material evidence
      2) failure to take into account and/or resolve conflicts  of  fact  or
         opinion on material matters
      3) taking into account and being influenced by immaterial evidence  or
         matters
      4) unfair procedure:  procedural  or  other  irregularity  capable  of
         making a material difference to the outcome or the fairness of  the
         proceedings
      5) misunderstanding or misconstruction of the law
      6) making a material misdirection of law on any matter
      7) irrationality (or perversity); perverse or irrational  findings  on
         matters which were material  to  the  outcome  (including  material
         findings of fact for which there was no evidence).

61. As regards irrationality or perversity,  in  Das  Gupta  this  Tribunal
    reasserted the importance of the approach in  Edwards  v  Bairstow,  in
    which various formulations  were  postulated;  in  particular  Viscount
    Simonds described such a case as one where  the  lower  court  or  body
    "have acted without any evidence or upon a  view  of  the  facts  which
    could not reasonably be entertained". In our judgment this was  not  an
    exhaustive definition of perversity and  we  accept  the  Secretary  of
    State's submission that a decision  which  contains  findings  of  fact
    which are internally inconsistent, and material, findings is one  which
    is irrational or perverse.  Further, findings which  are  "contrary  to
    the evidence" would constitute perversity or failure to have regard  to
    material evidence.

62. However failure to be precise in language is not an error  of  law,  if
    the reasoning is identifiable from consideration of the judgment  as  a
    whole: Retarded Children's Aid Society v Day [1978] 1 WLR 763  at  769.
    Judicial restraint should be exercised when a  tribunal's  reasons  are
    being examined, and the appellate court should not assume  too  readily
    that the tribunal misdirected itself just because not every step in its
    reasoning is set out: see R (JR Jamaica) v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 477 at �9 (a case involving a challenge
    to findings on witness credibility, which does not arise in the present
    cases).  Further the appeal court should not undertake  a  "microscopic
    search" for error: NH(India) v Entry Clearance Officer [2007] EWCA  Civ
    1330 at �28.

63. Finally, the error of law must be material, in the sense that it  might
    (rather than must) have made a difference to  the  outcome  before  the
    FTT: Nixon, �5 and also, by analogy, IA (Somalia) v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 323 at �15  per  Keene  LJ,  in
    relation to a public law challenge to an administrative decision.

64. As regards the burden of proof, in resolving disputed issues of fact, a
    court should conclude that it cannot decide one way or  the  other  and
    thus rely on the burden of proof (i.e. that the  case  is  not  proven)
    only exceptionally and as a last resort.  In Verlander, the  nature  of
    such an exceptional case was described as being no more than one  where
    the available evidence is conflicting, uncertain or  falling  short  of
    proof. Nevertheless it is clear that a court is under a duty to  strive
    to make a finding one way or the other, and, if it does resort  to  the
    burden of proof, it must give an explanation why and  what  efforts  it
    has made to reach clear findings: see Stephens v Cannon [2005] EWCA Civ
    222 at ��46 and 47; Verlander v. Devon Waste Management Ltd [2007] EWCA
    Civ 835 at �24; and Daejan Ltd v Benson and others [2011] EWCA  Civ  38
    at �86.

65. As regards the standard  of  proof,  in  relation  to  past  acts,  the
    standard is the normal civil standard of the balance of  probabilities.
    Any material relevant to meeting that civil standard of  proof  may  be
    received by the FTT whether it is hearsay or a summary  of  information
    held by others, but the weight  attached  to  it  will  depend  on  its
    nature, the circumstances in which it was collected  or  recorded,  the
    susceptibility of the information to error and the extent to which  the
    appellant is able to comment or rebut it: see Bah v. Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2012] UKUT  00196  (IAC)  at  ��60-66,  citing
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman [2001] UKHL  47  at
    ��22-23.

Discussion and analysis

66. Whilst the Secretary of State's challenge is made by reference to three
    different categories of error of law, we approach the  question  before
    us by reference to particular  substantive  findings,  central  to  the
    Decision and which are the subject of her criticism.

67. The issue in the case was whether the Appellant was  the  head  of  the
    OCG.  The FTT identified two sub-questions, largely in  line  with  the
    Secretary of State's "stepped" approach: (1)  whether  the  OCG  itself
    continued to exist  at  the  relevant  time  and  (2)  the  Appellant's
    involvement in the OCG.  Although resolution of the step (1) may not be
    critical, we address it before addressing the central question  of  the
    Appellant's involvement - both because logically  it  comes  first  and
    because the FTT addressed it first.  Before addressing either, however,
    we consider two preliminary general points.

The FTT's approach to XY's evidence

68. XY's evidence comprised two elements: first, adducing the  evidence  of
    the  transcripts  themselves,   and   second,   giving   his   personal
    interpretation of the words used in the transcripts and the conclusions
    which he deduced from them.  His witness statement essentially sets out
    his belief or opinion, based on the transcripts and other evidence, and
    his experience, that the Appellant is the head of the OCG.  At �25, the
    Tribunal sets out its approach to XY's evidence.  It accepted  that  he
    has "great expertise", albeit that he is not independent.  It commended
    the manner in which he  gave  his  evidence,  and  concluded  that  his
    answers assisted the FTT to understand the probe evidence.

69. The Secretary of State's complaint however is that,  when  it  came  to
    consider particular aspects of the probe evidence, the FTT did not give
    due weight or indeed any weight to XY's interpretation of that evidence
    or to his opinions more generally.  In particular, she  criticises  the
    FTT's refusal to accept XY's interpretation of the  first  conversation
    between B and C on 7 March 2014 (�46) and relegates  XY's  evidence  to
    mere "theory".

70. We accept that XY's own  interpretation  of  the  transcripts  and  his
    beliefs as  to  what  they  demonstrated  are,  of  themselves,  direct
    evidence.  We further accept that given his expertise and the fact that
    the FTT considered him to be fair and balanced witness,  XY's  evidence
    was properly to be accorded substantial weight. Moreover, by  contrast,
    the FTT found the Appellant's  evidence  on  particular  points  to  be
    evasive, unhelpful and obstructive, that  he  had  not  given  truthful
    evidence and that it had serious doubts about his  overall  credibility
    (��38 and 154).  Finally, we accept that there is  no  requirement  for
    XY's evidence to be corroborated.

71. Nevertheless, we do not consider that the FTT erred in its approach  to
    XY's  evidence.  Ultimately  his  evidence  of  interpretation  of  the
    transcripts and ultimately as to the Appellant's position  in  the  OCG
    was opinion evidence (admissible due to his expertise).   The  FTT  was
    not bound to  accept  that  evidence,  and  was  entitled,  and  indeed
    required, to reach its own conclusions and interpretations as  to  what
    the transcripts and XY's evidence established. A court  must  make  its
    own assessment of the evidence, including any expert opinion  evidence.
    That is what the FTT did here.  In our judgment, the FTT's approach  to
    XY's evidence at �46 and at �62 was neither inconsistent with  what  it
    said at �25 nor incorrect. Whilst the evidence adduced by the Appellant
    may have had little or no weight, nevertheless the FTT was entitled  to
    reach its own conclusions.

Standard of Proof: Ground 1

72. As regards the standard of proof in general, the FTT properly stated at
    the outset the correct, civil, standard  of  proof  to  be  applied  to
    resolve the issue.  Moreover, it is the case that at various points  in
    the Decision, the FTT correctly directed itself to that civil  standard
    of proof in relation to particular issues, and regardless of which  way
    it decided that particular issue: see for example  ��62  ("more  likely
    than not"), 88 and 110 ("more probable than not"),  and  130  ("on  the
    balance of probabilities").

73. However, at other points, the FTT did, in  our  judgment,  depart  from
    this approach.  In particular, where the FTT declined to make a finding
    adverse to the Appellant on the  basis  that  there  is  or  may  be  a
    possible alternative explanation or interpretation  (or  it  could  not
    find that there is no such possible alternative), in our judgment,  the
    FTT was imposing upon the Secretary of State a standard of proof  which
    is higher than the standard of "more likely than not".  (Whilst  it  is
    the case that at �46 the  FTT  refers  to  "other  possible  or  likely
    interpretation", this is, at best, ambiguous, and does not  indicate  a
    clear application of the correct standard, particularly given the other
    examples).

74. Of the six examples of error, relied upon by the  Secretary  of  State,
    three  of  them  arise  in  the  FTT's  assessment  of   the   recorded
    conversations relating to the Appellant's place in the hierarchy of the
    OCG.  We address this further below.  As regards the other instances of
    error relied upon the Secretary of State, we  do  not  agree  that  the
    references (�38) to matters "not inevitably  following"  are,  in  that
    context, a purported application of a standard of proof at all.  On the
    other hand, we agree that at ��89 ("the only interpretation")  and  147
    ("do not necessarily show"), the  FTT  fell  into  the  same  error  of
    requiring proof to a higher  standard  than  that  of  the  balance  of
    probabilities.  To that extent, there was an error of law.

The existence of the OCG

75. The FTT considered this issue at ��21-37, 146-147  and  154.   The  FTT
    found clearly that  the  OCG  "has  existed"  (at  least  until  2011).
    However, as to whether the OCG continued to exist, in our judgment, the
    FTT made no clear finding one way or the other: see ��147 and  154  and
    paragraph 21 above.  (At certain points, the implication of  particular
    findings is that the FTT  considered  it  did  still  exist:  see,  for
    example, �146; however this is not sufficiently clear to  amount  to  a
    finding).

76. First, the FTT considered that, in order to determine the issue  before
    it, it was not necessary for it to make a clear finding one way or  the
    other as to whether the OCG did still exist, as long as the possibility
    existed of the Appellant being able to revive it: (�41)  see  paragraph
    19 above.  We do not consider that  the  FTT  erred  in  reaching  this
    conclusion.

77. Secondly, if a decision, one way or the other, as to  whether  the  OCG
    continued to exist was necessary for the  FTT  to  determine  the  case
    before it, then in our judgment, the FTT erred in law,  in  failing  to
    resolve a disputed issue of fact.  The FTT made no such finding, beyond
    finding that the OCG might still exist: "keeping an open mind" does not
    amount to a finding.  The FTT failed to  make  a  decision  altogether.
    Indeed it did not go so far as to make a finding of "not proven"  (i.e.
    that it was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the  OCG
    still existed).

78. Thirdly, at various points the  FTT  is  not  clear  as  to  whether  a
    particular issue goes to the existence of the OCG or to the Appellant's
    involvement in the OCG: for example, at ��74 and 77, 89, 147.  Finally,
    as indicated above, in its assessment (at �147) of SO's  references  to
    "A", the FTT applied a standard of proof that was too high.  This was a
    further error of law.

The Appellant's involvement in the OCG

(1)  Conversation between B and E: Decision �57

79. In its section on the Appellant's "place in the hierarchy of  the  OCG"
    (��41-64), the FTT addressed four recorded conversations.  The third of
    those conversations was the one between B and E on  13  February  2014,
    considered at ��52 to 57, in which  B  confirmed  his  loyalty  to  the
    Appellant, if AB1 were to come  back:  see  paragraph  25  above.  XY's
    belief was that that conversation referred to a power struggle  between
    the two brothers and showed that the Appellant was head of the OCG  (XY
    statement �16).

80. The FTT rejected the Appellant's explanations of the conversation.   It
    made the important findings (�57) that that discussion  did  relate  to
    AB1, that AB1 was formerly the head of the OCG and that  the  Appellant
    himself was directly linked to the OCG  which  had  been  led  by  AB1.
    Significantly, the FTT added that the transcript went further than  the
    two conversations between B and C "in confirming XY's belief about  the
    hierarchy".  In other words,  it  supported  the  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant was head of the OCG.

81. In its specific conclusions on this section, at �63,  and  despite  its
    findings in �57, the FTT nevertheless rejected the proposition that the
    Appellant was head of the OCG.  Further, at ��149-153, the FTT  reached
    its final conclusions on the Appellant's involvement with the  OCG,  by
    drawing together and relying upon its various findings, including those
    covered in its section (��41-64)  on  the  Appellant's  "place  in  the
    hierarchy of the OCG".  In those conclusions, the FTT referred to three
    of the four recorded conversations: the two March conversations between
    B and C referring to "abi" (��43-51), and the 18 February  conversation
    between the Appellant and B (��58-61): see paragraphs 24 and 26  above.
    However, in those conclusions, the FTT makes no reference at all to B/E
    conversation.

82. In our judgment, this is a significant omission.  The findings  at  �57
    are clear and important findings by the  FTT  itself  of  a  connection
    between the Appellant and  the  OCG.   Further,  in  its  reference  to
    loyalty to the Appellant in the event of the return of AB1, the  former
    head of the OCG and given the context of the FTT's  own  findings,  the
    narrative of the conversation is, at the very  least,  highly  relevant
    evidence of the Appellant's leading position in the OCG.

83. Whilst we accept the Appellant's argument that the FTT's finding at �57
    is not in itself a finding that the Appellant was the head of the  OCG,
    it  is  certainly  more  than  a  "potential   suggestion"   of   "some
    involvement" in the OCG.  On the FTT's own view, this was the strongest
    evidence of the Appellant's position in the hierarchy, and yet  it  was
    not even mentioned in its final assessment of this issue.  Even if  the
    Appellant is correct that strictly this does not amount to  a  directly
    inconsistent finding,  these  were  important  evidence  and  important
    findings.  We conclude that, in this regard, the FTT wrongly failed  to
    take account of material evidence and of its own material findings.

84. In our judgment, in reaching its conclusion that the Appellant  is  not
    proven to be the head of the OCG (��152-154), the FTT  failed  to  take
    into  account  the  evidence  of  the  conversation  between  B  and  E
    discussing a power struggle between the Appellant and his brother  AB1,
    and its own findings in relation to that conversation.  The FTT thereby
    erred in law, by failing to take account of  material  evidence  and/or
    failing to take into account facts on material matters.

(2)  Retaliation for the Z Road shooting: Decision ��74, 77 and 152

85. The Appellant's involvement in events immediately following the Z  Road
    shooting formed a central part of the FTT's consideration of the issue:
    see  ��150  and  152  and  67  to  77.   XY's  evidence  was  that  the
    conversation between the Appellant and B on the following  day  showed,
    inter alia, that the Appellant had "given permission"  for  members  of
    the OCG to fight those who had carried out the attack.  A central issue
    was why, in fact, there had been no retaliation.

86. At �77, the FTT found that the conversation did not clearly  show  that
    the Appellant "had  issued  instructions  to  retaliate".   To  similar
    effect, in its final assessment at �152, the  FTT  concluded  that  the
    evidence did not show that the Appellant was "giving orders to  [B]  to
    exact revenge".  In reaching these conclusions in  both  passages,  the
    FTT further expressly relied upon the  fact  that  there  had  been  no
    retaliation in fact. Thus, in these  two  paragraphs,  the  absence  of
    retaliation was a point which favoured the Appellant's case  and  which
    militated against the Appellant being head of the OCG.

87. However, at �74,  the  FTT  had  directly  considered  the  Appellant's
    argument that the absence of  retaliation  was  inconsistent  with  the
    existence of the OCG and expressly declined to draw, from that absence,
    any inference in the Appellant's favour.

88. In our judgment, the FTT's positive reliance (at ��77 and 152) upon the
    absence of retaliation is inconsistent with its  earlier  finding  that
    the absence of retaliation did not assist the  Appellant's  contention.
    These are inconsistent findings on an issue which was  highly  material
    to the FTT's ultimate conclusions.  As such, this was an error of  law.
    The "unanswered question", referred to in �152, of why there  had  been
    no retaliation had in fact been answered by the FTT itself  at  �74:  G
    had already been arrested.

89. As to  the  Appellant's  contentions,  first,  we  do  not  accept  the
    distinction which he seeks to draw between the fact that there  was  no
    retaliation (addressed in  �77)  and  the  reasons  why  there  was  no
    retaliation (addressed in �74). Both ��74  and  77  (and  indeed  �152)
    address what, if any, conclusion can properly be drawn (in relation  to
    the existence of the OCG) from the fact of the absence of  retaliation.
    Secondly, whilst it is the case that at ��77 and 152 the FTT find  that
    no "order" to retaliate was given, an important part of the  underlying
    reasoning for that finding is the absence of retaliation in fact.

90. Finally, we point out, in agreement with the Secretary of State,  that,
    in its finding, the FTT appears to have mischaracterised XY's  evidence
    and thus the Secretary of State's case, as  being  that  the  Appellant
    "issued instructions"  and/or  "gave  orders"  to  retaliate  when  his
    evidence was that the conversation showed that he  was  merely  "giving
    permission" for retaliation.  There is force in the submission that the
    FTT was finding against the Secretary  of  State  upon  a  basis  never
    advanced.  The difference between the two might well have been material
    to the FTT's conclusions on this issue, since it might have led  it  to
    fail to consider the implications for its conclusion on the Appellant's
    role in the OCG.

(3)  The relationship between Appellant and B

91. At �152, the FTT found that B was not proven to have been acting as the
    Appellant's subordinate.  This was  a  crucial  step  in  reaching  its
    conclusion that the Appellant had not been proven to  be  head  of  the
    OCG.

92. However, in the course of its analysis,  the  FTT  made  the  following
    findings:

      1) B was a violent career criminal, a loan shark  and  a  drug  dealer
         (��149, 152)

      2) The Appellant had a close association with B, which the  FTT  found
         to be the most troubling part of the evidence (��149, 152).

      3) The Appellant:

          a) knew that B used an armoured vehicle and had been shot at, and
             that he used the A name.


          b) enlisted the support  of  unsavoury  characters,  including  B
             (�89).

      4) B, in turn respected, sought and took  advice  from  the  Appellant
         (�62), and  further  he  acted  "subserviently"  to  the  Appellant
         (�152).

93. Finally, and importantly, the FTT further found  that  the  "troubling"
    close association between the Appellant and  B  did  not  arise  simply
    "through the community or through their joint participation in the  car
    trade".   However, the FTT did not explain how,  or  decide  the  basis
    upon which, that close association did  arise.   Given  the  FTT's  own
    characterisation of that issue as being "troubling",  in  our  judgment
    that was a highly material issue and one upon which the FTT should have
    made a finding.  Thus the FTT erred in law, in not resolving  an  issue
    of fact in relation to a material matter.

94. In argument, the Appellant suggested that the association arose from  a
    business connection, but was unable to say whether  it  was  legitimate
    or, on the other hand "dodgy" and "criminal".  Regardless of that,  the
    FTT made no relevant finding to that effect.

95. Secondly, in failing to  consider,  together  and  in  the  round,  the
    findings in paragraph 92(1) to (4) above,  we  consider  that  the  FTT
    erred in law, by failing to aggregate its individual findings of  fact,
    amounting to a failure to  have  regard  to  material  evidence  and/or
    findings.

96. Thirdly, as regards the issue of being "subordinate", we consider  that
    the  FTT  erred  in  law  in  relation  to  the  two  of  the  recorded
    conversations where B uses the term  "abi".    In  its  conclusions  at
    ��46, 51 and 62, the FTT failed to take account of the Appellant's  own
    admissions (��44, 48) that the references  in  those  conversations  to
    "abi" might have been reference to him.  That amounted to a failure  to
    take account of material evidence.  Further, the FTT failed to  make  a
    clear finding, one way or the other,  as  to  what  or  who  was  being
    referred to as "abi".  It is not clear from ��49 to 51 whether the  FTT
    concluded that (1) it was not satisfied that "abi" was not referring to
    someone other than the Appellant or rather that (2) "abi" was referring
    to the Appellant, but that merely seeking advice was not sufficient  to
    show that  the  Appellant  was  head  of  the  OCG.   Finally,  in  its
    assessment of these conversations, the FTT applied a standard of  proof
    which was too high.  In particular at �51, the FTT effectively required
    the Secretary of State to demonstrate that no other  interpretation  of
    the  10  March  2014  conversation  (other  than  that  B  was   acting
    subserviently to the Appellant) was possible.  As explained above, that
    standard of proof is higher than the balance of  probabilities  and  is
    akin to applying the criminal standard of being "sure".

(4)  Hidden wealth

97. The second, key, element  in  the  FTT's  conclusions  on  whether  the
    Appellant was the head of the OCG was whether he  enjoyed  a  lifestyle
    consistent with such  a  position.   It  concluded  that  that  on  the
    evidence he did not.

98. The Secretary of State's case was that the  Appellant  had  managed  to
    hide his  wealth.   On  that  issue,  after  considering  his  property
    interests, his business activities and specifically his  car  business,
    the FTT did not find it likely that he had hidden  his  wealth:  ��110,
    115 and 153.

99. However in the course of its discussion (at ��91-120), the FTT made the
    following findings:

      1) Whilst mortgage payments totalling almost �100,000 had been paid in
         respect of two properties, the FTT did not accept  the  Appellant's
         case that those payments had  been  made  from  cash  derived  from
         rental income from [the property at 52]: �104.

      2) As regards his business activities, the Appellant had presented  an
         incomplete picture of his business dealings (�112) and had not been
         prepared to  provide  an  accurate  picture  of  his  circumstances
         (�114).

      3) As regards A Cars,  there  was  also  opacity  in  the  Appellant's
         evidence and an absence of  evidence  to  support  his  account  of
         running a legitimate car business.  The Appellant had not explained
         why the business only "ticks over".  The  Appellant's  evidence  to
         rebut the case that A Cars was a screen for other  activities  only
         served to undermine his account of it being a legitimate  business.
         Again the FTT was sure  that  the  Appellant  had  not  provided  a
         complete or accurate account of his activities: ��127, 128 and 130.
          A Cars was not the "main means" of support  for  himself  and  his
         family.

     In its conclusion at �153, the FTT was "sure" that  the  Appellant  was
    involved in many business arrangements of different kinds  and  it  had
    only been given a partial insight into these.

100. In our judgment, the FTT found  clearly  that  the  Appellant  had  not
    disclosed, and, what is more, had been inaccurate  in  disclosing,  the
    extent of his financial assets, his sources of income and his  business
    arrangements.  He had thus hidden his wealth, at least from the FTT. It
    does not necessarily follow that those assets had in fact  been  hidden
    more generally, in the sense that they could not be found by any  third
    party. Nevertheless,  in  the  absence  of  an  explanation,  it  is  a
    reasonable inference from the FTT's findings, given the  context,  that
    he had so hidden them.  The FTT provided no adequate explanation as  to
    why it did not draw that inference  from  the  Appellant's  failure  to
    provide to it a complete or accurate picture of his finances.  The only
    explanation given - notoriety and connections within the community, and
    operating on the fringes of legality - merely poses  further  questions
    as to what that involved; questions which the FTT did not answer.    In
    our judgment, the findings in paragraph 99 above, are inconsistent with
    the key finding to the effect that the Appellant  had  not  hidden  his
    wealth.  In this regard, the FTT erred in law.

101. We accept that the FTT's conclusion on this issue relied  substantially
    upon the fact that the NCA investigation resulted in  no  action  being
    taken (��110, 130, 153).  In our judgment, that was  not  determinative
    of the issue of whether wealth had been hidden nor does it detract from
    our conclusion that the FTT's findings were inconsistent.

(5)      Other matters - D and AS

102. Finally, we consider that, in reaching its conclusions, the FTT  failed
    adequately to take into  account  material  evidence  and  findings  in
    relation to two further matters, along with its other findings.  First,
    in relation to D, having found that the Appellant was seeking to  trace
    him and that his  intentions,  once  found,  "went  beyond"  having  an
    ordinary business meeting, the FTT failed to reach a conclusion  as  to
    what in fact the Appellant's intentions were or why  he  was  involving
    unsavoury characters.  Moreover, as pointed out in paragraph 74  above,
    in considering that question, the  FTT  applied  a  standard  of  proof
    higher than the civil standard.  Secondly, the FTT found as a fact that
    AS believed that the Appellant was  involved  in  criminal  activities:
    �137.  Yet, the FTT did not go  on  to  consider  what  those  criminal
    activities were or might have been.    This is a further example of the
    FTT erring in law, by failing to aggregate its individual  findings  of
    fact, amounting to a failure to have regard to material evidence and/or
    findings.

Materiality of the errors

103. As to the impact, upon the Decision, of the  errors  of  law  which  we
    have identified, it may be that, each individual error, had it occurred
    in isolation,  might  not  have  led  the  FTT  to  reach  a  different
    conclusion.  However we are satisfied that, taken together, had each of
    the errors not been made, the FTT's decision on appeal might have  been
    different and that the FTT, at the very  least,  might  have  concluded
    that the Appellant was the head of the OCG. In particular,  the  issues
    of retaliation and of the close association between the Appellant and B
    were at the heart of the FTT's decision and the errors of law  we  have
    found in those connections are more than capable of having affected the
    outcome.

Conclusions

Decision to be set aside

104. We conclude that in reaching its conclusion at �154  of  the  Decision,
    the FTT erred in law in the respects identified in paragraphs  74,  77,
    78, 84, 88, 93, 95, 96, 100 and 102  above,  and that those errors were
    material errors.

105. Accordingly, we will order that the Decision be set aside.

Re-making

106. We note the Secretary  of  State's  submission  that,  once  the  legal
    errors in the Decision have been identified, the only finding  that  is
    consistent with the evidence is that the Appellant was the head of  the
    OCG and that we should remake the decision.  However the Appellant  has
    indicated that that it wishes to draw attention to  further  documents,
    not considered at the error of law hearing, and to address other issues
    of fact.  We consider that, before proceeding to remake  the  decision,
    there should be an opportunity for further submissions to be made, both
    in respect of any matters not previously canvassed and of points  which
    arise out of this judgment.  We will hear the parties as  to  the  most
    appropriate manner in which such submissions should be made.


Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.  The decision of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  is  set
aside to be remade.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D O'Callaghan, Counsel, instructed by Irving &
Co, Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr J Hall QC and Mr D Blundell, Counsel, instructed
                    by the Government Legal Department.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


The background
      1. The appellant is  a  citizen  of  Turkey.  He  has  appealed  under
         Regulation  26  of  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
         Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations") against a decision of  the
         respondent, dated 16 June 2015, to make a deportation order against
         him under section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971  on  the  ground
         that section 3(5)(a) applies. The appellant is the family member of
         an EEA national and the respondent has decided that his removal  is
         justified on grounds  of  public  policy  and  public  security  by
         reference to Regulations 19(3)(b) and 21 of the EEA Regulations.

      2. The appellant has no convictions. The respondent seeks  to  justify
         her decision on the basis the appellant is the head of an Organised
         Crime  Group  ("OCG")[1]  which  has,  during  the  period  of  the
         appellant's leadership,  engaged  in  serious  organised  violence,
         blackmail and money-laundering. As such the appellant is considered
         to represent a  serious  threat  to  society  and  his  removal  is
         considered to be justified on serious grounds of both public policy
         and public security. The appellant denies being the head of an  OCG
         and also denies the existence of the OCG.

      3. Deportation action commenced on 11  February  2015  with  a  letter
         informing the appellant of his liability to deportation on  account
         of his "longstanding involvement and leadership roles in  organised
         crime". The respondent relied on the appellant's relationship  with
         one  B,  who  was  believed  to  be  the   appellant's   "principal
         lieutenant" in relation  to  his  organised  crime  activities.   A
         schedule  to  the  letter  contained  transcripts  of  aural  probe
         recordings setting out conversations to which the appellant  was  a
         party[2]. This evidence had figured in the trial of  the  appellant
         which had taken place at Woolwich Crown Court in January 2015.  The
         appellant was arrested in June 2014  and  originally  charged  with
         three offences: conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to  blackmail  and
         conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. Only the first of  those
         charges proceeded to trial[3]. The appellant  was  acquitted  after
         the jury failed to reach a verdict and no re-trial was ordered. His
         co-defendants were B, H, C, J (sometimes [only known by his  second
         name]) and F[4]. B pleaded guilty on 21 November 2014 to two counts
         of conspiracy to commit GBH and blackmail[5]. He was sentenced to a
         total 8�  years'  imprisonment.  F  also  pleaded  guilty  and  was
         sentenced  to  3  years'  imprisonment.  The   trial   of   J   was
         discontinued. The other defendants were found not  guilty.  Another
         person, K, was included in the indictment but for  some  reason  we
         have not been told his prosecution did not proceed with the others.



      4. The appellant's solicitors  made  representations  as  to  why  the
         appellant should not be  deported[6].  The  appellant's  solicitors
         pointed out the appellant had been acquitted and that  the  reasons
         for deportation relied on the same matters alleged  in  the  trial.
         However, the respondent made the decision to remove him on 16  June
         2015 and a deportation order was signed[7]. The  main  points  from
         the decision letter[8] were as follows:

      -    the  appellant  qualified  for  consideration   under   the   EEA
         Regulations because he was married to an Irish national;
     -   the appellant had resided in the UK continuously for ten  years  in
         accordance with the EEA Regulations;
     -   the appellant had permanent residence for the purposes of  the  EEA
         Regulations;
     -   his removal was justified on serious grounds of public  policy  and
         public security;
      -    notwithstanding  his  acquittal,  the  appellant  represented   a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the  public  to
         justify his deportation;
     -   removal was proportionate;
     -   there was insufficient evidence to show  the  appellant  enjoyed  a
         family relationship with his son;
     -   the appellant's son's best interests required him to remain  living
         with his mother;
     -   there  was  insufficient  evidence  showing  the  appellant  had  a
         genuine and subsisting relationship with his wife;
     -   the appellant's wife and son could adapt to living in Turkey.

      5. The grounds of appeal filed by the  appellant's  solicitors  argued
         principally that the appellant's decision  was  not  in  accordance
         with the EEA Regulations, the appellant having been acquitted after
         a trial[9]. The grounds argued the decision also breached Article 8
         of the Human Rights Convention because of the appellant's  valuable
         family life with his wife and son, whose  best  interests  required
         him to remain with both his parents[10].  The  appellant  does  not
         rely on protection grounds.

      6. A lengthy case management review hearing was held  on  13  November
         2015. The Tribunal's Decision on Applications  for  Directions  and
         Amended Directions is attached as an annex  to  this  decision  for
         ease of reference.

The hearing
      7. The respondent filed  five  lever  arch  folders  of  documents  in
         advance of the hearing and the appellant  one.  Further  additional
         documents were filed during the hearing. Following  an  adjournment
         and consequential directions, the respondent filed  a  sixth  lever
         arch  file  containing  additional  transcript  evidence[11].   The
         appellant filed  a  second  bundle,  containing  a  second  witness
         statement and additional documents. In view of the volume of papers
         produced this decision necessarily sets out only the most important
         parts of the evidence but this should not be interpreted as meaning
         other parts were not considered before this decision was  made.  We
         have read all of it.

      8. Over the course of 11, 12 and 13 April we heard oral evidence  from
         XY, an officer of the National Crime Agency ("NCA"), the appellant,
         the appellant's wife, AW, and the appellant's sister-in-law, AS. We
         have recorded the oral evidence in our record of  the  proceedings.
         Again, we shall only set out  the  most  important  parts  of  that
         evidence in this decision but we have considered all of it.

      9. One of the issues discussed at the case management  review  hearing
         was the  extent  to  which  fairness  required  the  respondent  to
         disclose transcript evidence beyond the excerpts contained  in  the
         first witness statement of XY and amended in his  third  statement.
         The application made on behalf of the appellant had initially  been
         for complete disclosure of the surveillance evidence. The  Tribunal
         ruled that it was disproportionate to  direct  complete  disclosure
         given the quantity of evidence which would be produced by  such  an
         exercise[12]. However, during cross-examination  of  XY  it  became
         apparent that there were real concerns about the  manner  in  which
         the transcripts had been edited and set out in XY's statement, even
         after attempts had been made to resolve this issue by  the  service
         of his third statement. In the light of the Tribunal's observations
         to this effect, Mr O'Callaghan applied for an adjournment to enable
         additional limited disclosure of  the  transcript  evidence  to  be
         made. Mr Hall QC did not oppose the application and an agreed order
         for directions was prepared. This is also annexed to this decision.



     10. At the resumed hearing, neither the appellant nor XY were recalled.
         We heard closing submissions and reserved our decision.

Uncontentious matters
     11. The following matters are set out here by way of background. It  is
         not considered that they were disputed.

     12. The appellant lived in Turkey prior to his arrival in the UK  on  5
         April 1994, at the age of 21. He is Kurdish. His family home is  in
         Lice in Diyarbakir Province, south-eastern Turkey. He held leave to
         remain in the UK as a student until 30 March 2001. An out  of  time
         application for further  leave,  submitted  on  17  May  2001,  was
         eventually refused on 12 April 2005 at which  time  he  was  served
         with a notice of  liability  to  removal.  No  further  enforcement
         action was  taken.  In  the  meantime,  on  7  December  2002,  the
         appellant married AW, an Irish national. The couple had a  son,  R,
         born in 2005. R is now ten years' old. In 2005  AW  applied  for  a
         residence permit, acknowledging her right to reside in the UK, with
         the appellant as her dependant. The applications  were  granted  by
         the respondent on 4 June 2007  valid  until  4  June  2012.  On  17
         February 2010 the appellant applied  to  naturalise  as  a  British
         citizen but his application  was  refused.  The  appellant  made  a
         further application on  1  September  2011,  which  was  eventually
         refused on 16 June 2014, on character grounds.

     13. In around 2002 AW and the appellant purchased a property at [52] in
         Edgware for �250,000 with the assistance of a mortgage.  Title  was
         in the name of AW. In 2007 they purchased [a  property  at  56]  in
         Edgware for �430,000, again with the assistance of a  mortgage  and
         again in AW's sole name. This is now the couple's home.  They  kept
         [the property at 52]. An office  was  built  at  the  side  of  the
         property for the appellant to use as  an  office.  Both  properties
         remain subject to substantial  mortgages  and  they  are  currently
         vested in AW's  trustee  in  bankruptcy.  The  action  to  make  AW
         bankrupt followed the escalation of a  relatively  small  debt  for
         unpaid council tax on [the property at 52] to in excess of �70,000.
         The legal title of a significantly  more  valuable  property,  [the
         property at 3] Edgware, is held in the appellant's name.

     14.  Up  until  around  1998  the  appellant  was  involved  in  family
         businesses, including running a hotel  in  Brighton.  In  1997  the
         appellant was taking steps to purchase a lake and surrounding  land
         in Oxfordshire. However, in March 1998, the  family's  assets  were
         seized and the appellant  did  not  proceed.  In  around  2000  the
         appellant abandoned his MBA studies.

     15. The appellant has three older brothers  who  are  all  now  serving
         lengthy prison sentences. The eldest, AB1, was sentenced in 1984 to
         12  years'  imprisonment  for  the  importation   of   heroin   and
         transferred to Turkey to serve his sentence. On 10 February 2001 he
         was tried in  the  Netherlands  and  found  guilty  on  charges  of
         conspiracy to murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling.  His  sentence
         was increased to life. He is the subject of an exclusion  order  in
         the UK.

     16. AB2 was arrested on 27 March 1998 and charged with  illegal  entry,
         handling  forged  documents  and  possession  of  a   firearm   and
         ammunition. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, reduced to
         12 months on appeal. He was arrested again  in  February  2004  and
         subsequently sentenced to  22  years'  imprisonment  following  his
         convictions for heroin trafficking,  conspiracy  to  blackmail  and
         perverting the course of justice. However, he successfully appealed
         against his conviction and was acquitted at a re-trial in  November
         2010. He was excluded from  the  UK  and  voluntarily  returned  to
         Turkey, having renounced his refugee status. He had been recognised
         as a refugee following a successful appeal to the then  Immigration
         Appellate Authority, which heard the appeal on  10  February  2005.
         The Adjudicator rejected much of what he was told about  events  in
         Turkey but accepted the appellant would be at risk because of AB1's
         links to a pro-PKK TV channel and the perception of  links  between
         drug smuggling and the funding of the  PKK.  AB2  is  currently  in
         prison in Turkey in relation to the seizure of a very large  amount
         of cocaine.

     17. AB3 was sentenced to 30 years'  imprisonment  on  19  October  2011
         following his convictions involving drugs and money-laundering.  In
         2005 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal had accepted  his  account
         of political activity  and  ill-treatment.  It  accepted  that  the
         family were a high-profile Kurdish  family  and  wealthy.  It  also
         found there was evidence of  AB3  providing  intelligence  to  HMRC
         officials.  AB3's  appeal  against  conviction  and  sentence   was
         unsuccessful. Lord Thomas LCJ said the evidence plainly showed that
         MSB had engaged in extensive travel to South America in  connection
         with the drugs conspiracy. The trial judge  had  been  entitled  to
         conclude that  he  was  near  the  top  of  the  supply  chain  and
         distribution organisation.  His  provisional  release  date  is  18
         November 2025.

Assessment and findings of fact
     18. We now turn to contested matters and give reasons for our findings.
         In respect of our findings of fact we have applied  throughout  the
         civil standard of a balance of probabilities. Generally, the burden
         of proof rests on the appellant to establish any matter of fact  on
         which he relies.


     19. We may consider evidence about anything we deem relevant,  even  if
         it took place after the date of decision. There were  no  arguments
         about the admissibility of any of the evidence adduced. In the case
         of MB (admissible evidence; interview  records)  Iran  [2012]  UKUT
         00019(IAC) the Upper Tribunal explained that Tribunals do not  have
         a general discretion to refuse to receive relevant evidence on  the
         basis of procedural defects as to how it was obtained.  Apart  from
         circumstances where the lateness of the evidence means that  it  is
         unfair to receive it, issues of fairness go to  the  weight  to  be
         attached to evidence, not admissibility.

     20. The factual matters relied on by the respondent to show that  there
         are serious grounds of public policy or public security  justifying
         the appellant's deportation must be established by  the  respondent
         to the civil standard of proof of a balance of probabilities.

The existence of the OCG
     21. The appellant's case is, not only that he is not the leader of  the
         OCG, but that there is no OCG. The appellant accepts he is  related
         to his brothers, as stated, but distances himself from them. In his
         first witness statement[13] he says he  has  very  limited  contact
         with any of his family members, apart from some of his nephews  and
         nieces. He was involved in running the family businesses  up  until
         1998 but, after their assets were seized in  1998,  he  decided  to
         forge his own way as an individual and  in  business.  He  has  had
         familial contact after  that  but  no  business  links.  He  is  an
         ordinary businessman trying very hard to make a go of his life[14].
         AS says in her statement that the notion that her  husband  is  the
         head of an OCG is "ridiculous"[15]. The appellant's  sister-in-law,
         AS the wife of AB3, also states that the appellant had very  little
         contact with her husband[16].

     22. In his evidence to us the appellant stated there was no OCG in  his
         family's name[17]. In cross-examination the appellant was reluctant
         to confirm he knew anything about organised crime  in  general.  He
         eventually confirmed he had heard about  gangs  making  money  from
         threatening people but only from the news, documentaries  and  from
         being in prison. He refused to accept that  AB3  was  an  organised
         criminal. His refusal to answer a straightforward  question  as  to
         whether he accepted his brother was an organised criminal  led  the
         Tribunal to have to intervene to ask him to answer  questions.  The
         appellant then confirmed only that his brother  was  found  guilty.
         However, he did not believe AB3  was  involved  in  that  "kind  of
         business". He said AB1 was  the  one  involved.  He  said  AB1  had
         publicly admitted international criminal activity. In  relation  to
         AB2, he similarly accepted he had pleaded guilty to being  involved
         in organised crime but denied any knowledge beyond the  conviction.
         Later he said he had suffered as a result of  having  the  name  A,
         which we  took  to  refer  to  the  failed  prosecution  and  other
         investigations made by the authorities,  as  well  as  the  present
         deportation proceedings.

     23. In his written closing submissions, Mr Hall QC  made  much  of  the
         "evasive and obstructive" manner in which the  appellant  gave  his
         evidence[18]. Mr O'Callaghan asked us to find  he  was  a  credible
         witness.  We  found  the  appellant's   unwillingness   to   answer
         straightforward questions about his brothers' criminal  activities,
         which are now a matter of public knowledge, to be disingenuous  and
         a deliberate ploy to distance himself from  his  brothers  and  the
         imputation that he is, or has  also  been,  involved  in  organised
         crime. We are sure that there has been an OCG in the name of A,  as
         alleged by the respondent. We find ample evidence  supporting  this
         conclusion in the following.

     24. XY is  an  officer  of  the  NCA  who  has  been  involved  in  the
         investigation of serious  organised  crime  for  25  years[19].  He
         previously worked for the NCA's predecessor, SOCA, and before  that
         he worked for the investigation division of HMRC. During  the  last
         six years of his time with HMRC he was in  the  Eastern  Hemisphere
         drugs branch which predominantly dealt with heroin trafficking from
         Turkey to the UK. At that time he became aware  of  the  A  family,
         although he had no involvement in investigating members  of  the  A
         family until 2012[20].  Mr  O'Callaghan  did  not  challenge  these
         credentials but he did ask XY about his involvement with this case.
         XY confirmed he had acted simply as a "resource". He had  not  been
         present at the trials of either the appellant or G[21].

     25. We accept XY's experience is lengthy and relevant to a case of this
         nature.   He  is  a  professional  law-enforcement   officer   with
         specialist knowledge in the  field  of  drug-trafficking.  Mr  Hall
         referred  to  him   as   being   an   "expert"   in   his   closing
         submissions[22].    Mr    O'Callaghan    disagreed    with     this
         characterisation[23]. We have not assessed his evidence  as  if  he
         were an independent expert, as he is plainly not  independent,  but
         we accept he has great expertise due to his lengthy experience as a
         law officer working in the field of organised crime, including  the
         activities of organised criminals in the drugs trade. We considered
         XY was careful to keep within  the  limits  of  this  role  and  he
         rightly made it clear  when  he  did  not  know  the  answer  to  a
         particular question and when his  answers  were  based  on  general
         impressions rather than specific knowledge. His answers assisted us
         to understand the probe evidence.

     26. XY's evidence was  placed  under  pressure  by  Mr  O'Callaghan  in
         relation to the fact, as XY accepted, the  way  in  which  excerpts
         from the transcripts had been set out in his first statement, dated
         29 September 2015, gave rise to the possibility that  something  of
         the context of the excerpts might have been lost. In some places it
         was not clear that there had been a break in the conversation  and,
         in others, there was no indication that parts of  the  conversation
         had been omitted. Plainly Mr O'Callaghan was right to  pursue  this
         matter. A third witness statement from XY was prepared in time  for
         the third day of the hearing, on 13 April 2016, and XY was recalled
         to give further evidence. However, continuing concerns of the  kind
         indicated led to the appeal being adjourned so that  the  parts  of
         the conversations which  immediately  preceded  and  succeeded  the
         extracts set out in XY's first statement, as amended in  his  third
         statement, could be seen and responded to by the appellant.

     27. XY was apologetic for the fact these concerns led to the  need  for
         the appeal to be adjourned. We found his evidence about how it  had
         come about that his first statement had been  written  in  the  way
         that it had been sincere and genuine. He had had had  to  copy  and
         paste from various translations which were in different formats and
         this had led to some errors, particularly with regard to dates  and
         times. His word processing skills were limited and he  had  had  no
         support to assist him with the preparation of the statement,  other
         than legal advice about what could be included. As  the  additional
         excerpts provided for the adjourned hearing showed, nothing of real
         importance had been left out of  the  original  excerpts.  We  were
         satisfied, therefore, that XY has acted with  integrity  throughout
         these proceedings and that the errors and omissions from his  first
         statement were purely accidental. No doubt the shortcomings in  the
         first statement could have been  avoided  with  greater  oversight.
         Whilst we do not condone sloppiness in the preparation of  evidence
         we understand the reasons for  it  in  this  case  and  we  can  be
         satisfied that no real prejudice was caused to the appellant by the
         errors in the statements and transcripts as  originally  served  or
         the late service of the fuller extracts.

     28. We noted that Mr O'Callaghan did not renew the application made  by
         counsel  at  the  case  management  review  hearing  that  all  the
         transcript evidence should be produced[24].  Having indicated  that
         we were sympathetic to an adjournment on 13 April we  were  content
         for the representatives to agree the  form  of  order  for  further
         directions. The resulting draft order was modest  in  its  request,
         only asking to see transcripts of  two  minutes'  recording  either
         side of the existing excerpts[25]. Overall, therefore, we  accepted
         XY's confirmation in his second statement, signed  on  17  December
         2015, that  his  choice  of  materials  to  exhibit  to  his  first
         statement accurately reflected the strengths and weaknesses of  his
         assessment of the appellant's activities[26]. In short, he had  not
         "cherry-picked" the evidence to submit to us in order to  create  a
         skewed impression.

     29. Much of the transcript evidence has been translated  from  Turkish.
         We have therefore made allowance for the fact that translations may
         not convey the precise meaning of  the  words  used  with  complete
         success. However, it is also appropriate at this point to note that
         no objection was made to the translations provided.  The  appellant
         did refer during his cross-examination to the fact  the  transcript
         was a translation,  although  we  did  not  understand  him  to  be
         challenging the accuracy of the translation as such.  He also  made
         a comment about the translation of one small part of the additional
         transcripts  but  we  do  not  regard  the  particular  passage  as
         significant[27]. No other matters were brought to our attention and
         we have therefore proceeded on the basis that it was accepted  that
         the  translations  were  accurate.  We  noted  that  the  appellant
         confirmed the translations were generally correct at his  trial[28]
         although he did suggest there might be difficulties towards the end
         of cross-examination.

     30. We also made some allowance for the fact that, as XY explained, the
         audio quality of the probe evidence varied and that  explained  why
         in many places the transcript states, "unintelligible". We are also
         fully conscious of the fact that a  transcript  of  a  conversation
         merely tells us the words used but cannot tell  us  anything  about
         the speaker's manner of expression.

     31. We now turn to what XY's evidence tells us about the  existence  of
         the OCG. As said above, we accept that XY has particular  knowledge
         of this type of criminality  and  we  accept  what  he  says  about
         becoming aware of the OCG. He came across  this  knowledge  in  the
         course of his professional work, although  he  was  not  personally
         involved in investigating it.

     32. XY states that the OCG has existed since the 1970s[29].  The  basis
         for this assessment is not entirely clear but we note that AB1  was
         convicted and sentenced for the importation of heroin in  1984.  We
         note that AB2 told the Adjudicator hearing his appeal  in  February
         2005 that his parents were well-off and  had  amassed  considerable
         assets. He had sold property before coming to the UK and  used  the
         proceeds to purchase a hotel in Hove. His family still  owned  some
         60 flats in Istanbul, a hotel, a farm and five  summer  houses[30].
         At her appeal hearing in August 2008, AB1W, the wife of  AB1,  said
         she did not know whether the family still held assets in Turkey but
         she confirmed that AB1 had purchased a hotel in Brighton. She could
         not confirm the purchase  price  had  been  �3.2  million[31].  The
         appellant told the Tribunal in the appeal of AB2 that, in 1993,  he
         had been in Italy attending a marble fair because he  owned  a  25%
         share in the family's  marble  factory[32].  AB1  was  subsequently
         convicted in the Netherlands of conspiracy  to  murder,  kidnapping
         and drug smuggling. AB2 was convicted in the UK in 1998 of  illegal
         entry, handling forged documents and the possession  of  a  firearm
         and ammunition. He has no further UK convictions but  is  currently
         in prison in Turkey in relation to, according  to  XY's  statement,
         the  seizure  of  291kg  of  cocaine[33].  AB3's   appeal   against
         conviction was unsuccessful.  As  noted,  the  Lord  Chief  Justice
         observed he had been travelling to South America in connection with
         a drugs conspiracy and  was  directing  operations  in  London[34].
         Whilst the appellant and AS said they thought AB3 was  not  guilty,
         we see no reason at all to go behind the conviction. The Lord Chief
         Justice noted that the conspiracy to  import  cocaine  was  "highly
         organised drug trafficking on a vast scale, which had been  planned
         and was in execution for a considerable  time"[35].  The  appellant
         confirmed that various business in Turkey were  registered  in  his
         name since approximately 1990[36].

     33. It appeared to us fanciful to suggest that there was not some  form
         of connection between the appellant's three older brothers  all  of
         whom can safely be considered to  have  been  involved  in  serious
         organised crime,  involving  the  importation  of  hard  drugs.  XY
         suggests AB2 took over the leadership role when AB1  was  sentenced
         in the Netherlands and that AB3 took  over  when  AB2  returned  to
         Turkey. There is a logic to this given that the three were born  in
         1956, 1961 and 1963 respectively.  We also agree with Mr Hall  that
         the appellant did not adequately address  the  evidence  confirming
         the existence of an OCG and his oral evidence  on  this  point  was
         evasive and obstructive.

     34. We find as fact there has been an OCG, at least until AB3's  arrest
         in 2011.

     35. XY has exhibited  a  series  of  press  cuttings  to  support  this
         conclusion[37].  We   would   be   slow   to   attach   significant
         determinative weight to such evidence for obvious reasons  and,  as
         stated above, we do not need to do so in  this  case.  However,  we
         would observe that it is unlikely that a serious newspaper such  as
         The Independent would publish an article about AB2, describing  him
         as "the Godfather of [...]", as it did on 30 April  2006  following
         the conviction which was subsequently overturned,  unless  it  felt
         confident about its sources of information. The article stated that
         AB2 co-ordinated a massive drug-smuggling ring,  ran  an  extortion
         racket and was linked to a  number  of  brutal  murders.  The  same
         article referred to AB1 trafficking heroin and buying business  and
         property interests in the UK.   Reporters  who  spoke  to  business
         owners in the areas of North London affected spoke of  a  "A  Clan"
         linked to the Bombacilars and Kurdish Bulldog gangs.

     36. At his trial at the Central Criminal Court in  relation  to  the  Z
         Road shooting (see below), G claimed that the reason he fired shots
         into the caf� was to frighten members of the A  gang,  specifically
         C, who had threatened to visit  his  kebab  shop  with  a  view  to
         extorting money from the family business[38]. He described them  as
         "a really dangerous gang" and he said he believed the man he  fired
         at in the street, who turned out to be an  NCA  officer,  to  be  a
         member of the A gang[39]. He described  the  gang's  activities  as
         blackmail and extorting shop owners for money. They also  kidnapped
         people. He said the appellant was in charge  of  the  gang[40].  He
         said it was well-known that C worked for the A  gang[41].  He  also
         said B worked for the appellant and that C  worked  for  B[42].  He
         said C and his gang always socialised in the caf�[43].

     37. Of course, G was found guilty of the reduced charge of  endangering
         life and his defence was disbelieved by the jury. We understand why
         Mr O'Callaghan said it was not a strong  defence  and  went  on  to
         ridicule it in his closing submissions. We are  slow  therefore  to
         attach any weight to G's evidence insofar as it was disbelieved  by
         the jury. We cannot speculate about what was and was  not  accepted
         from the evidence. We simply record that, to the extent G has given
         evidence about the existence of an OCG, his evidence was consistent
         with XY's beliefs about it. As with the press articles, we  do  not
         need to rely on this evidence to  arrive  at  our  conclusion  that
         there has been an OCG.

The appellant's involvement in the OCG - discussion
     38. Our starting-point therefore is that there has been an OCG for many
         years and that the appellant was not cooperating with the  Tribunal
         when  he  denied  its  existence.  It  is  inconceivable  that  the
         appellant did not know that the OCG existed given his family  ties.
         We remind ourselves that his evidence was not that there was an OCG
         but it had been wound down or that there was one in  existence  but
         he had  nothing  to  do  with  it.  His  denial  of  its  existence
         undermines his credibility generally. However, we also accept  that
         it does not inevitably follow from our finding that there has  been
         an OCG that the appellant has been involved with it. We  are  fully
         conscious that the  appellant  has  no  convictions.  Nor  does  it
         inevitably follow that the OCG continued to  function  because  the
         appellant picked up the reins following the arrest of AB3.

     39. We make our findings on the appellant's involvement on the basis of
         the evidence which we shall now discuss. It  is  helpful  to  break
         this down into the various areas roughly along the lines identified
         and set out in XY's  statement,  the  skeleton  arguments  and  the
         schedule of evidence prepared by Mr O'Callaghan, as well as others.



     40. We shall set out a summary of the evidence and submissions on  each
         area and  then  give  our  assessment  before  drawing  the  points
         together to reach an overall conclusion.  We have looked at all the
         evidence  and  submissions  in  the  round  before   reaching   any
         conclusions.

The appellant's place in the hierarchy of the OCG
     41. The respondent's case is that the appellant is the  leader  of  the
         OCG, the presumption being that he  took  over  control  after  his
         older brother, AB3, was imprisoned in  2011.  We  remind  ourselves
         that the  respondent  must  show  that,  among  other  things,  the
         appellant represents  a  present  threat  to  public  security  and
         therefore that we must be satisfied the appellant  currently  leads
         the OCG or has the capability to revive it.

     42. It is worth mentioning at this stage that we accept that an OCG  is
         likely to have a leader, who  would  exercise  authority  over  his
         subordinates, and that it is in the nature  of  such  organisations
         that the person at the top would simply be the organiser who  would
         have people under his control who would be willing to carry out the
         actual crimes on his instructions. Some of his  subordinates  would
         be in control of others, creating  a  pyramid  structure.  In  this
         context it is not necessarily surprising that the head  of  an  OCG
         would not have any convictions.

     43. XY's first excerpt from the transcript evidence is  a  conversation
         between B and C which took place in B's car on  7  March  2014[44].
         XY's belief is that B is a "loan shark" and the appellant's violent
         enforcer and that C is another member of the OCG who is junior to B
         in the chain of command. In the extract provided the men appear  to
         be talking about the remuneration they receive from someone  called
         "abi". C asks B how much "abi" gives him but  B  declines  to  give
         that information. C also asks B for extra money which B says he  is
         not authorised to give him.

     44. In cross-examination the appellant pointed out that  his  name  was
         not used in this conversation. However, he accepted they might have
         been talking about him. Asked then why they were talking about  how
         much they received from him, the appellant suggested they could  be
         talking about business invoices. B ran a car firm called [PP] Cars.
         Pressed to explain why C would ask B how much  he,  the  appellant,
         had been paying him, the appellant said it was just a joke. We  did
         not find the appellant's replies  helpful  as  it  appeared  to  us
         difficult to interpret what B is saying about money  received  from
         the appellant as relating to car deals. Nor do we detect any  trace
         of humour in the conversation.

     45. However,  having  carefully  read  the  transcript,  including  the
         extended version provided with XY's fourth statement, we find it is
         not possible to come to firm conclusions about what  the  pair  are
         discussing and, more importantly, whether they are discussing their
         relationship to the appellant. It is at least clear to  us  that  B
         and C are discussing various sources of income and  that  they  are
         not exclusively paid by "abi". They  talk  about  their  respective
         "wage pacts" but then B asks C to clarify whether he is asking only
         about money received from abi or other income as well. At one point
         C refers to paying money to "the boss" without it being  clear  who
         he is talking about[45]. The appellant is  not  named  anywhere.  C
         appears to be complaining that he gets less than B but B  will  not
         confirm this.

     46. We are conscious that  this  extract,  along  with  all  the  probe
         material, has been presented to us along with an explanation as  to
         its meaning provided by XY. We have  been  careful  to  attempt  to
         stand back and  read  the  material  impartially  without  actively
         looking for parts which confirm XY's beliefs. We have attempted  as
         far as possible to keep an open mind about what the words used seen
         through the prism of translation could really mean. This excerpt is
         a  good  example  of  a  conversation  which  could  reasonably  be
         interpreted to fit with the theory  that  B  and  C  obtain  money,
         perhaps through blackmailing small traders in the  area,  and  that
         this money has to be given to the appellant for the "organisation".
         They are discussing what cut  they  are  permitted  to  retain  for
         themselves. B has since been convicted.  On  the  other  hand,  the
         appellant  is  nowhere  mentioned  and,  in   our   judgment,   the
         conversation is not sufficiently clear  or  coherent  that  it  can
         safely  be  said  that  there  are  no  other  possible  or  likely
         interpretations.

     47. XY's second excerpt from the transcript evidence is  another  short
         conversation between B and C, which also  took  place  in  B's  car
         three days later on 10 March 2014[46]. They talk about the  fact  D
         had spoken to B at some time previously and asked him  to  go  into
         the drinks business with him. B reported that he had  told  D  that
         only "abi" could tell him to get involved.

     48. Mr O'Callaghan cross-examined XY on  the  basis  that  "abi"  could
         refer to someone else. XY said that "abi" refers to the  appellant.
         It is a term of respect. He said that B uses the term elsewhere  in
         the transcript evidence to refer  to  the  appellant,  although  he
         accepted he might also use it to refer to others because  it  is  a
         commonly used word. XY maintained B was referring to the  appellant
         because there was nothing  in  the  whole  of  the  probe  evidence
         suggesting B ever worked for anyone else.  In cross-examination the
         appellant could not say why B said what he said but he  accepted  B
         could have been referring to him. Then he said B  might  have  been
         showing off.

     49. We note from the earlier transcript of 7 March 2014 that C  appears
         to use "abi" to refer to B.  It  is  plainly  used  as  a  term  of
         respect[47]. However, the overall tone of that conversation is  one
         of familiarity between them.  In  the  10  March  2014  extract,  C
         addresses B as "mate"[48].

     50. We find the second of XY's extracts  is  of  little  assistance  in
         demonstrating the appellant's place in  a  hierarchical  structure.
         The speakers are plainly respectful towards the person  they  refer
         to as "abi", who is not named, but the critical passage  relied  on
         by XY, where B says only "abi' can tell him to get involved,  could
         be explained by B seeking advice.

     51. As became clear, the appellant did exercise  authority  over  D  in
         respect of the drinks business in Bournemouth and  B  had  attended
         the meeting on 29 January 2014 in which the  appellant  had  vented
         his spleen in no uncertain terms on Dover matters  which  had  gone
         wrong  with  the  running  of  the  business[49].  This  particular
         conversation was held only days after D had disappeared and both  B
         and C had been involved in the visit to D's house  in  Bournemouth.
         It is not surprising therefore that  the  pair  would  be  speaking
         about D in these terms  and  B  would  be  justifying  not  getting
         involved directly with D. Again, we cannot say  that  this  extract
         carries significant weight in showing the appellant's  place  in  a
         hierarchy which must be an OCG. Whilst it might be read as  showing
         B acting subserviently towards the appellant with  respect  to  the
         Bournemouth drinks business, that is not  the  only  interpretation
         possible and it does not go very far in establishing the  appellant
         is the head of an OCG.

     52. The third excerpt in XY's statement sets out a conversation between
         B and another person, called E, discussing what may  happen  if  AB
         comes back[50], which began as a result of E having a  dream  about
         it[51]. The date of the conversation is erroneously recorded as  13
         January 2014 but XY clarified in his third  statement  this  should
         read 13 February 2014[52]. Perhaps the most  significant  quotation
         is when B confirms, using the appellant's first name, that  "...  I
         started this business with "A abi", I will finish with "A abi"  ...
         there isn't any other ..."

     53. XY said he believes the reference to AB coming back refers  to  the
         appellant's eldest brother and that the conversation discusses what
         would happen if he did come back in terms of a power  struggle.  Mr
         O'Callaghan  made  the  point  in  cross-examination  that  it  was
         unlikely that B would  be  referring  to  the  appellant's  brother
         because he is serving a life sentence in the Netherlands,  where  a
         life sentence means life unless a Royal pardon is granted. B  would
         know this.

     54. We noted from the statement made by AB1 on 21 December 2014, at the
         request of the lawyers acting for AB3, that he had made significant
         progress  towards  revealing  "fabricated  evidence   etc."   Fresh
         evidence was being investigated  by  the  Attorney-General[53].  He
         appeared at that time to be confident that he  might  overturn  his
         conviction, although there is no evidence before us of  the  up  to
         date situation.  We find this evidence lessens  the  impact  of  Mr
         O'Callaghan's point.

     55. Mr O'Callaghan also put it to XY that the reference by  E  to  this
         being the second time (AB had come back) was inconsistent with this
         being the appellant's brother as there had not been a  first  time.
         XY could not answer this. He  maintained  the  reference  by  B  to
         "business" must refer to criminal enterprise.

     56. The appellant's cross-examination on this  conversation  was  again
         interrupted by the Tribunal  requesting  the  appellant  to  answer
         questions in a straightforward manner. He pointed out that, if  the
         AB  mentioned  had  been  his  brother,  it  would  not  have  been
         appropriate for B to refer to him as "brother AB", as this would be
         disrespectful. He said it was possible B was referring to  his  own
         brother, called [by the same first  name],  but  he  accepted  [B's
         brother] was younger than B, so this was  unlikely.  The  appellant
         denied that B was saying that he would be loyal to him even if  AB1
         came back. We take on board the appellant's point, made  throughout
         his evidence, that it is difficult for him to know what people were
         talking about in a conversation at which he was not present.

     57. In our judgment, the additional transcript  evidence  filed  by  XY
         makes  it  clear  that  the  pair  probably  were  discussing   the
         appellant's  brother,  AB1.  There  are  references  to  the  hotel
         business, to AB1 going to the  Netherlands  and  to  his  being  in
         prison such a long time[54]. We find this extract goes further than
         the other two towards confirming XY's belief  about  the  hierarchy
         and it also links the appellant directly to the organisation  which
         AB1 formerly led.

     58. XY also produces an extract of a conversation  in  B's  car  on  18
         February 2014 in which the appellant talks about the  structure  of
         the OCG. It is worth setting this out verbatim:

         "Centralised, you know centralised? What  I've  managed  to  do  or
         tried to distance myself from centralisation.  Do  you  understand?
         What do I do? Let  Ramo  use  his  initiative,  Serdo[55]  his  own
         initiative. Dino[56] should have another initiative. Let them check
         one another but let  them  have  their  own  initiatives.  I  can't
         establish the mechanism for them to check one another because  they
         "It's nothing to do with me," they prevent what you establish. They
         stay back. It ends with them not taking their own responsibilities.
         However, you know what will take us to go on properly forever? It's
         me not be centralist. Everything must not be  done  because  I  say
         them? The others and everyone should have their own initiative. ...
         If such a system, such a set up can be established you would become
         immortal, you  would  become  immortal.  You  understand  what  I'm
         saying? It will be immortal. ..."

     59. The appellant responds by saying this was only an  extract  from  a
         long conversation about Middle Eastern politics[57].  Specifically,
         the appellant was explaining how Israel had  managed  to  establish
         itself. Cross-examination of  XY  focused  on  the  length  of  the
         extract and the fairness of not providing more of the  conversation
         in order to understand the context. After  the  adjournment  on  13
         April, additional parts of the conversation were  produced[58].  We
         have carefully noted this extract. XY has produced  the  transcript
         beginning 7 minutes prior to the original excerpt,  which  is  five
         minutes more than directed. The audio ends almost immediately after
         the  original  excerpt.  There  is  nothing  in  the  full  extract
         indicating there was any discussion of Middle Eastern politics.  In
         fact, the full extract shows very clearly that the context was that
         the appellant  was  admonishing  B  and  was  angry  with  him.  He
         describes him as someone who can "take someone over a cliff".

     60. In cross-examination, the appellant was asked to  account  for  his
         use of the words "immortal" and "centralised". The  appellant  said
         the context of the conversation was that he was criticising  H  for
         discouraging another member of the community  from  establishing  a
         barber  shop  in  Bournemouth.  He  was  saying  that  they  should
         encourage each other. He gave himself as an  example  and  said  he
         should not be in the  middle  of  everything.  He  was  not  giving
         orders. However, he could not say  who  else  might  be  B's  boss.
         Again, the additional transcript evidence provides no  support  for
         the appellant's account.

     61. Nonetheless, we find we can  only  place  limited  weight  on  this
         evidence. Whilst the appellant's  explanation  was  unsatisfactory,
         the extract is not sufficiently clear that we  can  find  no  other
         interpretations are possible other than XY's belief that  it  shows
         the appellant giving orders as to how the OCG should be arranged so
         as to ensure nothing that happened was attributable to him.

     62. We consider the evidence on this issue, taken as a whole, shows the
         appellant has close associations with B and C.  The  former  has  a
         serious criminal record.  The  use  of  the  word  "abi"  does  not
         indicate the appellant's superiority in an OCG as it is  clearly  a
         term of  respect  used  in  normal  discourse  within  the  Kurdish
         community. We respect XY's professional opinions and give them some
         weight. We have also placed some significance  on  the  appellant's
         evasive  posture  towards  the  issue  of  whether  the  AB1  being
         discussed was his brother. The extracts support the notion  that  B
         and C respect the appellant and take advice from him.  However,  we
         are unable to say that this advice - or even direction  -  is  more
         likely than not attributable to the appellant being the head of  an
         OCG.

     63. As we shall discuss below, we are far from  finding  the  appellant
         operates solely as a legitimate businessman. It  was  plain  to  us
         that the appellant has gained some notoriety from his  family  name
         and that he probably uses it to exert influence. However, there  is
         a wide gap between this and finding the appellant  currently  heads
         an OCG

     64. Likewise, in considering the evidence of AS (see below),  we  found
         much in her evidence which paints the appellant in an  unfavourable
         light. In the conversation  recorded  between  her  and  B  in  the
         latter's car on 12 February 2014  B  complained  that  he  had  not
         managed to set up a business to give him "an official  income."[59]
         This contradicted the appellant's evidence that B was a  legitimate
         car dealer, trading as [PP] Cars. However, showing someone may  not
         operate entirely as he presents himself, that is as  a  car  dealer
         and entrepreneur, is not the same as showing he is the head  of  an
         OCG.

The residence card
     65. The appellant argues that, were he the  head  of  an  OCG  or  even
         involved with one, he  would  not  have  been  issued  a  residence
         document on 4 June 2007. XY was unable to comment on this. As  with
         a  previous  application  for  leave  to  remain,  the  appellant's
         application for a residence document  took  a  very  long  time  to
         decide. His naturalisation application also took  a  long  time  to
         decide[60]. The implication is that the  Home  Office  dragged  its
         feet  and  was  investigating  the  appellant  before,  eventually,
         deciding  there  was  nothing  adverse  to  warrant   refusal.   We
         understand the logic of this but do not consider it  borne  out  by
         the evidence.

     66. The appellant's solicitors have produced the response to a  Subject
         Access Request made on 11 March 2015[61]. This  sheds  very  little
         light on the thinking behind the decision, approved on 27  February
         2007, to issue documents. We accept there is nothing  in  the  file
         showing there was information to hand regarding the possibility the
         appellant was involved with crime, let alone an OCG. Of course,  it
         is unlikely he would have been granted a document if this had  come
         to light. It appears from the handwritten minutes that the Minister
         approved the application[62]. However, we  do  not  infer  anything
         from this as it is possible that  nothing  which  the  police  were
         aware of at  that  time  had  been  communicated  to  the  European
         Casework Directorate. The appellant had, as now, no convictions. We
         cannot infer from the absence of anything in the notes  that  there
         was information but it was not considered sufficiently  serious  to
         warrant refusal. We therefore regard this as a neutral point.

Z Road shooting
     67. At the beginning of XY's evidence, he showed us a number  of  short
         video clips taken from CCTV  recordings  depicting  from  different
         angles a shooting in Z Road, in [an] area of  North  London,  which
         took place during the evening of 23  May  2014.  It  showed  one  G
         taking out a handgun and firing into shop/caf�  premises.  He  then
         ran off, exchanging fire with someone who, unknown to him,  was  an
         NCA  officer.  G  was  arrested  and  subsequently  tried.  He  was
         convicted only of endangering life, although  the  original  charge
         had been attempted murder. XY said the premises which  G  fired  at
         were used by members of the OCG, including C and one  M.   He  also
         said that the shooting came  in  retaliation  for  a  confrontation
         between C and others the previous day. C is shown emerging from the
         caf� after the shooting. XY suggested the  reason  he  was  wearing
         gloves (on a warm evening) was to avoid forensic contamination from
         the use of a firearm. There was no  suggestion  the  appellant  was
         present.

     68. Towards the end of his first statement, XY sets out the  transcript
         of a conversation between the appellant and B in the  late  evening
         of the day of the shooting, 23 May 2014[63]. It records B receiving
         a telephone call from someone about the shooting and  appearing  to
         instruct the caller to leave the place, presumably the caf�, and go
         home.  B  then  relays  this  information  to  the  appellant.  The
         transcript ends at this point with a loss of audio and the sound of
         a door, which we take to be the car door.

     69. The appellant told us the reason he was in a car  with  B  at  that
         time was probably that B was taking him home.  We  have  considered
         the significance of the fact that news of the shooting  was  passed
         to the appellant via B so soon after the incident had taken  place.
         As noted, NCA officers were at the scene and the transcript clearly
         shows the appellant and B were interested in  this  aspect  of  the
         incident.

     70. Towards the beginning, XY's first statement contains  a  transcript
         of a  conversation  between  the  appellant  and  B  the  following
         morning. It was also recorded in B's car, an armoured  BMW[64].  Mr
         O'Callaghan told us that his instructions were that  the  appellant
         did not know the car was armoured but,  in  cross-examination,  the
         appellant said the car had been a joke to him,  suggesting  he  was
         aware of it. Indeed, he went on to explain it. He said B had  moved
         back to Edgware after his car had been shot  at  in  front  of  his
         house. The logical inference to draw was that B was taking steps to
         protect himself. The appellant accepted in  cross-examination  that
         he was acquainted with people who had guns.

     71. In the excerpt the appellant appears to instruct B that he will  go
         away and, if anyone calls for him, he should tell them he had  told
         people not to fight. Towards the end of the excerpt  the  appellant
         appears to suggest that, if there had been someone with  a  gun  at
         the door, he could have fired  back  at  their  feet.  The  message
         conveyed  by  the  appellant  to  B  was,  according  to  XY,  that
         retaliatory action could  be  taken  against  the  people  who  had
         attacked the shop  but  the  appellant  must  not  be  seen  to  be
         involved. The additional transcript evidence did not  add  anything
         material[65].


     72. The appellant points out that he was not charged in connection with
         the incident or any connection to the premises[66].  He  emphasises
         that  the  only  significant  part  of  the  conversation  is   his
         instruction not to fight, implying he meant  this  literally.   The
         appellant also pointed out in his second statement that  the  owner
         of the caf�, , was not questioned by the police and did not make  a
         statement for G's trial[67]. This point  would  have  carried  more
         weight if it had been made much sooner  so  that  the  respondent's
         legal team could have considered it. However, we accept  that  some
         weight should be given to the fact the appellant was not  found  to
         have any connection to the caf� premises.

     73. XY then sets out another excerpt later the same morning in which  B
         passes on the message to M that they should  have  been  armed  and
         ready[68]. This is consistent with B being  a  dangerous  criminal.
         However, there is nothing in the short extract which  shows  B  was
         passing down orders from the appellant or anyone else.

     74. It was put to XY in cross-examination that there was no evidence of
         any retaliation being taken for the shooting by the OCG  or  anyone
         else. The implication of this line  of  questioning  was  that  the
         absence of retaliation was inconsistent with there being a OCG.  In
         Mr O'Callaghan's colourful phrase, this would surely be a time  for
         the appellant to give the order  to  "go  to  the  mattresses.[69]"
         However, that argument assumes that  G  was  also  a  gang  member.
         Moreover, as XY pointed out, G was arrested at the scene and  there
         was therefore no opportunity to  take  retaliatory  action  against
         him. He accepted that one other person involved was  not  arrested.
         In the circumstances, we do not draw any inference from the failure
         of the OCG to retaliate. This would require us to indulge in  undue
         speculation about the incident based on the little  information  we
         have. We are not able to say that G was acting on behalf of another
         gang.

     75. Cross-examined  about  these  conversations,  it  was  put  to  the
         appellant that the  incident  had  not  been  a  joke,  as  he  had
         suggested. However, the  appellant  maintained  that  his  comments
         about shooting back were simply stupid  remarks  and  not  intended
         seriously. He said he had been in the car with B when B received  a
         call telling him  about  the  shooting.  The  appellant  eventually
         accepted the excerpt showed that he understood that people he  knew
         had guns but he said it was not for him to decide  what  they  did.
         The appellant denied giving an instruction which was passed  on  to
         F. He accepted that B and F had  pleaded  guilty  to  a  charge  of
         conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to
         other matters.[70]

     76. The appellant points out that he was on remand at the same time  as
         G and attended the prison mosque at the same time  as  him  without
         there being any incident between them[71]. Again, we infer  nothing
         from this. We only have the appellant's assertion about  this  and,
         given the seriousness of the charges he was facing, we believe  the
         appellant would be unlikely to jeopardise  his  defence  by  acting
         personally against G.

     77. Drawing the points together, we note that the appellant  was  given
         news of the shooting early on  and  his  interest  in  it  was  not
         amusement. It is curious that the  appellant  was  told  about  the
         incident so soon after it happened. However,  the  imputation  that
         the appellant then issued instructions to retaliate is not  clearly
         borne out by  the  transcripts.  Furthermore,  given  there  is  no
         evidence of any retaliation taking place,  XY's  depiction  of  the
         appellant as the head of a ruthless  OCG  prepared  to  use  lethal
         violence does not gain much support from this evidence.

Security conscious behaviour
     78.  XY  produces  excerpts  which  he  believes  show  the   appellant
         exhibiting security-conscious behaviour which would  be  consistent
         with an OCG. In particular, the appellant conducted meetings  at  H
         Barbers  premises  in  Edgware.  He  says  the  appellant  has   no
         legitimate controlling influence in the  business  to  explain  his
         frequent presence there. We note that  the  appellant  told  us  he
         invested in the business through A Cars Ltd. We also note  that  H,
         whom the appellant describes as a  barber[72],  was  one  of  those
         charged in connection with the attempted kidnapping of  D[73].  One
         very short extract appears to record B talking  about  being  at  a
         meeting in  front  of  the  barbershop  in  Edgware  at  which  the
         appellant and  E  were  present[74].  The  appellant  says  in  his
         statement he was simply socialising there as it  was  near  to  his
         business premises [at 52][75]. As a car dealer he conducts much  of
         his business over the telephone. He would go outside  the  shop  to
         talk for privacy reasons but he denies  being  aware  that  he  was
         under surveillance. XY explained that  it  was  difficult  for  law
         enforcement officers to infiltrate such a place. He said there  had
         been a lot  of  surveillance  of  the  premises.  He  accepted  the
         barbershop has some legitimate customers.


     79. We do not attach much significance to this evidence as showing  the
         appellant is head of an OCG. The appellant could  be  visiting  the
         barbershop for any number of innocent reasons,  although  we  could
         not understand why the appellant would have been  holding  a  large
         amount of cash belong to H Barbers[76]. There  is  nothing  in  the
         respondent's evidence establishing the premises are  used  for  any
         nefarious purposes.

     80. In another excerpt produced by XY, the appellant and B discuss  the
         possibility that B's car had a listening device installed  when  it
         was taken by the police for forensic examination after  being  shot
         at[77]. This took place on 27 January 2014. It was suggested to  XY
         that this could have been simple banter given the possibility of  a
         bug having been placed in the car did not appear to stop B  talking
         about it. The appellant explains this conversation in the following
         way. He had arranged for B to sell  an  Audi  car  for  him  at  an
         auction. He had sold the car to someone who had been in an accident
         in which a woman was killed. He was asking whether he would get the
         car back as the full purchase price had  not  at  that  stage  been
         paid[78].

     81. The additional probe evidence is not entirely clear but it suggests
         that the car they were  originally  discussing  had  encountered  a
         problem with its smartphone connectivity/bluetooth after  going  to
         the police pound. Our interpretation is that  B  was  hypothesising
         about the reason for that being a listening device which the police
         had  installed.  It  is  difficult  to  reconcile  the  appellant's
         evidence with the transcript because it appears that the pair  were
         discussing a different vehicle before the appellant asks about  the
         Audi and B explained the police would not return it because a woman
         had died in a murder-related matter[79]. They then went on to  talk
         about a Jaguar and problems with a gas-fuelled vehicle.

     82. On the one hand,  it  is  difficult  to  interpret  parts  of  this
         conversation as nothing more than innocent  banter.  On  the  other
         hand, we do not consider this extract contains  clear  evidence  of
         the appellant operating  as  the  head  of  an  OCG.  Much  of  the
         conversation concerned various cars and we bear in mind it  is  the
         appellant's case that he is a legitimate car dealer.

D
     83. D is a former business associate of the appellant. In the  criminal
         proceedings, the prosecution alleged that the appellant, B, H and C
         conspired to blackmail D, to kidnap him and to cause him GBH. There
         had been a meeting on 29 January 2014 at [the property  at  52]  in
         which the appellant had verbally abused D for around  three  hours.
         During the late evening of 3  March  2014  D  dialled  999,  having
         observed H, C and K outside his house. He reported that  they  were
         threatening him[80].

     84. XY explains in  his  statement  that,  after  a  dispute  with  the
         appellant  and  the  aborted  kidnap  attempt  from  his  home   in
         Bournemouth, D fled abroad on or about 4 March  2014.  XY  believes
         the OCG then sought to locate D through a  range  of  sophisticated
         methods[81].  XY exhibits a  set  of  D's  bank  statements  and  a
         forensic  report  confirming   that   the   appellant's   and   B's
         fingerprints were found on them. From around early March  2014  the
         statements show transactions in different  European  countries  and
         someone has marked these and written the name  of  the  country  in
         Turkish alongside the entries. XY believes these show the appellant
         and B attempting to trace D[82].

     85. The appellant's statement contains a very detailed account  of  his
         dealings with Dup to and including the  problems  caused  to  their
         joint  drinks  business,  H  and  B  Cash   and   Carry,   by   D's
         disappearance. Among other things,  he  had  changed  the  computer
         passwords before he left. The  appellant  admits  his  fingerprints
         appear on the bank statements and explains he wanted to try to find
         out what had happened to the business's assets. However, he did not
         write  on  them[83].  At  his  trial  he  accepted  his   counsel's
         description of an abusive tirade which he delivered  to  D  at  the
         meeting on 29 January  2014  as  a  "severe  roasting"[84]  but  he
         repeatedly denied under cross-examination that he had  intended  to
         intimidate  him.  To  the  judge  he  denied  that  D  had   looked
         distressed. Asked whether he was not concerned that D  would  react
         violently to the appellant saying he was going to "fuck his  wife",
         the appellant said he was not because D appeared not to  care  what
         was being said[85]. We find that wholly unlikely.  On  any  reading
         the transcript shows very clearly  that  the  appellant  was  using
         highly offensive, demeaning and provocative language towards D over
         a very lengthy period[86]. However, we also take  Mr  O'Callaghan's
         point that the CPS can  be  presumed  to  have  decided  there  was
         insufficient evidence to charge the appellant with  making  threats
         to kill and, of course, the appellant was not convicted.

     86. The probe evidence records a conversation between  B  and  C  on  7
         March 2014 in which C appears to  suggest  beating  up  L,  who  is
         likely to be D's brother[87]. The appellant  makes  no  comment  on
         this[88]. We note that, at the end of the transcript, B  says  they
         will go and see L without repeating any intention to beat  him  up.
         Whilst the pair refer once or twice  to  "abi"  and  B  appears  to
         receive a call from "abi"[89], there is nothing beyond  speculation
         to show the appellant was involved with a plan to injure L. We also
         note that Mr Has, the appellant's criminal solicitor  travelled  to
         Turkey to take a statement from L  in  October  2014  in  which  he
         described the appellant in glowing terms and blamed the collapse of
         the business squarely  on  his  brother[90],  although  a  tactical
         decision was taken  at  the  appellant's  trial  not  to  call  any
         evidence[91].

     87. XY also sets out transcript evidence of  B  and  C  discussing  the
         possibility of tracing calls in Europe  on  11  March  2014[92].  B
         reports that intelligence people in Turkey could not track  numbers
         in European countries. B and C appear to hatch a plan  to  transfer
         the ownership of D's car and then report it as stolen so  that  the
         police will contact them when it is found and they will be able  to
         apprehend D outside the magistrates' court.  B  says,  "We'll  wait
         outside ... (unintelligible) you grab and throw him inside,  right?
         If the  plan  goes  well,  it's  very  nice,  eh?"  Mr  O'Callaghan
         suggested to XY that it was  not  a  very  well  thought  out  plan
         because the  perpetrators  would  be  unlikely  to  get  away  with
         snatching somebody outside a public building. It was put to XY that
         such a fantastic plan was inconsistent with a ruthless OCG  of  the
         kind described. XY maintained B had previously tried to  kidnap  D,
         although both B and the appellant were found  not  guilty  of  this
         particular offence.


     88. We find there is evidence showing B and C were  extremely  keen  to
         find D to bring him back  to  the  UK.  We  remind  ourselves  that
         neither of them were partners in the Bournemouth business  venture.
         Whilst we recognise the appellant was acquitted of all  charges  in
         connection with this matter, we find it more probable than not that
         the appellant was seeking to trace D and then  to  find  a  way  to
         encounter him. The appellant admitted at his  trial  he  wanted  to
         contact D after he disappeared[93].  The  overall  context  of  the
         conversations and the tone of  the  language  used  makes  it  more
         probable than not  that  the  appellant's  intentions  went  beyond
         having an ordinary business meeting with D. Indeed, Mr Has confirms
         in his statement that the previous meeting  between  the  appellant
         and D could not be described as a  "traditional  business  meeting"
         because it was clear the appellant was angry[94]. That  appears  to
         us to be a considerable understatement. However, we also  recognise
         the force of Mr O'Callaghan's argument that,  taking  XY's  beliefs
         about what the probe evidence shows at face  value,  it  could  not
         reasonably be said that the evidence showed "sophisticated" efforts
         to trace D. Whether or not the business was legitimate, it is clear
         that D had upset the appellant  and  assets  of  the  company  were
         missing. Retrieving the missing money and goods appeared to  depend
         on making contact with D.


     89. Whatever the appellant's intentions were when he finally came  face
         to face with D we cannot say this evidence can only be  interpreted
         as demonstrating the existence of an OCG.  The  appellant  was  not
         convicted. The CPS accepted the appellant  was  not  aware  of  the
         threat to kidnap D. He plainly used extreme verbal intimidation and
         enlisted the support of unsavoury characters, such as B and  C,  in
         his efforts to force D to change his behaviour. On the other  hand,
         the means deployed to try to get hold of him  cannot  in  truth  be
         described  as  "sophisticated".  The  evidence  does  not,  in  our
         judgment, show that the steps taken  to  trace  D  demonstrate  the
         existence of an OCG.


     90. At this point we should say that  we  have  considered  one  of  Mr
         O'Callaghan's central arguments, which was that  the  CPS  had  not
         prosecuted the  appellant  and  his  associates  on  the  basis  of
         organised crime. He helpfully took us  to  the  definition  of  the
         offence in section 45 of the Serious Crime Act 2015. However,  that
         provision was obviously not in force at the relevant  time  and  we
         were not told in what  way  the  appellant's  prosecution  tangibly
         differed from a  prosecution  on  the  basis  of  organised  crime.
         Accordingly, we have given  this  argument  little  weight  in  our
         deliberations.

The appellant's properties
     91. XY states that the appellant owns [a property at 3], Edgware, which
         is worth in the region of �1.3 million. He purchased  the  property
         in 1995[95]. The appellant states he does not have  any  beneficial
         ownership of the property, which is owned by his brother,  AB1.  He
         holds it as AB1's "nominee"[96]. The appellant  produced  documents
         to support his contention regarding this property.

     92. Firstly, there is an order of Sedley  J,  made  on  8  April  1998,
         prohibiting  the  disposal  of  various  assets  and  appointing  a
         receiver.  Those  assets  included  [the  property   at   3].   The
         proceedings were brought under the Drug Trafficking Act  1994.  The
         defendant in the  proceedings  was  AB1,  although  the  order  was
         addressed to him, NE Ltd and the  appellant.  The  order  was  made
         following a request for confiscation of assets made  by  the  Dutch
         government.

     93. Secondly, there is a copy of a witness statement made by AB1 on  21
         December 2014 on behalf of AB3 in which he explains  that  he  sold
         assets before leaving Turkey, having secured the agreement  of  the
         British government to whom he had agreed to provide information. He
         bought the house without a mortgage and title was registered in the
         appellant's sole name[97]. None of his brothers had any  beneficial
         interest in the house[98].

     94. Thirdly, there is a transcript of the oral judgment in AB2's appeal
         to the Court of Appeal (Criminal  Division)  given  on  30  October
         2014. The  Court  was  solely  concerned  with  a  challenge  to  a
         confiscation order made by the Crown Court. The Court dismissed the
         appeal finding  the  hearing  had  been  fair  notwithstanding  the
         absence of AB2 (who was by that time in prison in Turkey). In doing
         so, it left undisturbed the trial  judge's  rejection  of  evidence
         that AB1 was the beneficial owner of [the property at 3] such  that
         AB2 had no interest[99].

     95. There is no suggestion the appellant lives there. It is unclear who
         does but we note AB1's statement claims none of the  brothers  live
         there and it is his family  home[100].  We  note  that  it  is  the
         address given for one AR, one of  the  visitors  to  the  appellant
         while he was on remand in HMP Belmarsh[101]. The  appellant  states
         that he is his nephew[102] and we assume this is the AR referred to
         as being AB1's son[103].


     96. The balance of the evidence does not  support  the  view  that  the
         appellant has any beneficial interest in the property, although his
         legal title plainly shows a connection to his brother's  activities
         at the time it was purchased. We accept the appellant is prohibited
         from disposing of the property and that he does not live there.

     97. The property at [52] was purchased in 2002 when the  appellant  was
         in the UK with leave to enter as a student and around the  time  he
         married. The property was registered in AW's name. The property  is
         currently vested in the  trustee  in  bankruptcy  with  a  view  to
         selling it[104].  XY exhibits a series of statements from AW's HBOS
         mortgage  account  showing  the  mortgage  was  paid  by   way   of
         "considerable cash payments", totalling �33,540,  between  December
         2009 and December 2012[105].

     98. The house at [56] was also purchased in AW's name. We accept  that,
         at the time of the purchase in 2007,  the  appellant's  immigration
         status was still in the process of being resolved which would  have
         made  it  problematic  to  obtain  a  mortgage  in  his  or   joint
         names[106]. As with [the property at 52], the property is currently
         vested in the trustee  in  bankruptcy[107].  XY  also  shows  that,
         between July 2009 and December 2012, the mortgage was paid by means
         of cash deposits totalling �64,940[108].

     99. The inference which XY asks us to draw  is  that  money  was  being
         "laundered" from the appellant's criminal activities to  repay  the
         mortgages  on  AW's  properties.  The  appellant  denies  this  and
         explains in his statement that the mortgage is paid in cash derived
         from rental income from [the property at 52][109]. AW confirms that
         the appellant took control of their finances and she  believes  the
         cash payments were  derived  from  rental  income[110].  In  cross-
         examination the appellant explained that, since 2009, his  finances
         had gone downhill. In particular, his wife had  not  been  able  to
         cope. Mr Hall put it to the appellant that it was an enormous waste
         of time to receive rent in cash and to pay it into  the  bank  each
         time. The appellant insisted it was necessary because rental income
         and also income from Turkey did  not  always  arrive  on  time.  He
         denied that the money was from the proceeds of crime.

    100. Whilst we  note  the  appellant  declared  rental  income  and  his
         documents have been seized[111], we observe nonetheless that  there
         is little before us by way of a paper trail showing the money which
         was deposited in the mortgage accounts came from payments  of  rent
         in cash. We have in  mind  evidence  such  as  tenancy  agreements,
         receipts, rent  books,  statements  from  tenants,  utility  bills,
         accounts, accountant's letters, tax payments or any of the numerous
         ways in which landlords can establish the receipt of rental income.
         We note that, at his trial, the appellant said that he  rented  out
         three double rooms[112]. He said D was the  "main  tenant"[113],  B
         was a tenant until 2009[114] and C lived there in 2011/12[115].

    101. The appellant has produced documentation  relating  to  AW's  unmet
         council tax liability which led to the bankruptcy proceedings[116].
         A statement  has  been  prepared  by  Mr  Ali  Has,  the  solicitor
         currently   representing   the   appellant   and   AW   in    civil
         proceedings[117]. In the section of his statement dealing with AW's
         ongoing council tax issue he says that his firm's file  shows  that
         the issue emanated from 2008/9 and was in relation to  renting  out
         [the property at 52]: "As far as we can understand it, it was  said
         that the property had been let to multiple occupants and  that  for
         that reason a HMO licence had to be applied for. At the time N  had
         been renting the property. He failed to pay  the  relevant  council
         tax on the property for about 2 years or so. The  original  council
         tax sums due were in the  region  of  approximately  �2,068.23  and
         despite N accepting liability for the debt both in writing  and  in
         person to Harrow  Council,  they  decided  to  pursue  AW  for  the
         debt."[118]

    102. AW confirmed in her statement  made  in  the  proceedings  she  has
         brought seeking to annul the bankruptcy order  made  on  12  August
         2011 that she recollects [the property at 52] being rented to N and
         P[119]. The latter left but  this  did  not  concern  her  and  her
         husband told her that N  was  a  good  tenant.  Later  on,  another
         tenant, called Q, also tried to  resolve  the  matter  with  Harrow
         Council. Emails confirming this were attached to AW's statement, as
         was a statement signed by N on 13 December 2012[120].

    103. One tenancy agreement has been copied, which related to the tenancy
         granted by AW jointly to N, P and A Cars Ltd on 18 October 2009  at
         a rental of �1300 per month. The guarantor was H. We note  that  XY
         includes H in his list of members of the OCG[121] and N (alias  NN)
         as a visitor to the appellant in HMP Belmarsh who  has  some  minor
         convictions[122]. XY also states that N has been contacted by B  in
         prison.  The  appellant  states  that  B  was  one  of  the   first
         tenants[123].

    104. We appreciate the appellant's documents were  seized.  However,  we
         find the evidence of a genuine rental arrangement which could yield
         sufficient sums to make  substantial  mortgage  repayments  on  two
         properties at the same time  for  up  to  three  years  very  scant
         indeed. We note  the  evidence  of  Mr  Has  has  been  couched  in
         extremely careful terms and, significantly, his statement does  not
         inform us what findings, if any, were made by the county  court  in
         respect of AW's evidence on this  point.  The  Order,  made  on  22
         October 2014, makes no reference to tenants or rental  income[124].
         There is considerable  doubt  in  our  minds  as  to  whether  [the
         property at 52] was rented out in the conventional sense  to  rent-
         paying tenants such that the considerable cash  repayments  can  be
         accounted for.

    105. We have noted that the appellant and AW were arrested in connection
         with allegations of money laundering but these allegations did  not
         relate to the mortgage repayments or claimed rental income[125]. No
         further action was taken due to  lack  of  evidence[126],  a  point
         which we shall consider further below.  We  assume  no  allegations
         have ever been made in respect of the mortgage repayments prior  to
         these proceedings. We do not therefore give this matter significant
         weight in our overall consideration of whether the appellant is the
         head of the OCG.

    106. The appellant's case, as explained by Mr O'Callaghan, was  that  he
         cannot possibly be the head of an OCG because he is hard-up, he has
         missed mortgage payments and is in still arrears with his  mortgage
         on [the property at 56][127]. We have seen a letter from  the  Bank
         of Scotland to AW,  dated  27  January  2016,  stating  there  were
         arrears  of  �2,329.43  and   the   existing   payment   plan   had
         expired[128]. As at 1 May  2015  the  outstanding  balance  on  the
         account was �440,844.65[129]. The appellant has taken out two loans
         from Santander to ease his money problems[130]. The appellant  says
         they converted the mortgage on [the property at 52] to an  interest
         only mortgage after they  bought  [the  property  at  56][131].  As
         noted, AW has been made bankrupt because a  relatively  small  debt
         was allowed to spiral out of control. We accept the information  in
         the documents showing the GB has  mortgage  arrears  and  that  the
         appellant has borrowed from Santander. We also accept  the  medical
         report, dated 18  March  2015,  prepared  by  Dr  Peter  McCrae,  a
         consultant psychiatrist working in  the  NHS,  shows  that  AW  has
         struggled to cope with the situation, although the main trigger for
         her adjustment disorder appears to have been the fact the appellant
         was remanded in custody awaiting trial from June 2014 until January
         2015[132].

    107. We have set out  above  some  of  the  evidence  relating  to  AW's
         financial problems. We further note that, in around April 2015, the
         NCA served AW with a notice of assessment of tax under  section  29
         of the Taxes Management Act 1970 for the  periods  from  2004/5  to
         2008/9. Her liability for tax was estimated to be over �300,000 and
         is alleged to have derived from discrepancies  between  the  income
         declarations made in her  mortgage  applications  and  declarations
         made to HMRC[133]. XY states that, in her mortgage applications, AW
         declared an income of �140,000 per annum from A Cars Ltd, which was
         not reflected in the company's accounts[134]. The matter has yet to
         be resolved. AW says nothing about this in her statement other than
         referring to a letter from her lawyer[135]. We accept the matter is
         still pending resolution and we do not attempt to prejudge  it.  We
         merely note that AW's lawyer, Mr Has, suggests the entire fault lay
         with mortgage brokers[136]. The accountancy firm which had inflated
         AW's income is no longer trading[137].

    108. For our purposes this evidence  underscores  the  need  for  us  to
         approach all issues concerning the  appellant's  finances  with  an
         abundance of caution. On the one hand,  the  appellant  manages  to
         make very substantial cash payments towards his  mortgages  without
         showing in a satisfactory manner  that  the  money  came  from  the
         sources he claims. On the other hand, he seeks to show that he  and
         AW are impecunious and therefore invites us to find this  does  not
         sit easily with the respondent's case that he is  the  head  of  an
         OCG, which is presumably a profitable situation. It is  unfortunate
         that the issues regarding AW's non-payment of  council  tax,  which
         led to bankruptcy proceedings, and the ongoing  assessment  of  her
         liability for unpaid taxes have not been resolved in  a  way  which
         assists us to make  an  assessment  of  whether  the  appellant  is
         correct in his assertions regarding his  impecuniousness.  However,
         other matters did assist us.

    109. Mr O'Callaghan's submissions to  us  made  much  of  the  fact  the
         appellant is not, as he put it, awash with money. We  find  he  was
         right to highlight this point because it must be correct  that,  if
         the appellant were the head of  an  OCG,  he  could  reasonably  be
         expected to enjoy a certain lifestyle. Whilst he  obviously  enjoys
         respect among members of the community and he has  probably  gained
         notoriety as a result of his family name, it has not been shown  by
         the respondent that he is a wealthy man. On the  face  of  it,  the
         clear evidence that he is unable to pay off his mortgages  and  his
         wife's debts have led to both  properties,  including  their  home,
         being vested in the trustee in bankruptcy  is  wholly  inconsistent
         with XY's beliefs regarding the appellant operating  an  OCG  which
         engages in, among other things, extortion rackets.

    110. It would be na�ve not to recognise that the head of an OCG could be
         expected to take steps to  hide  his  wealth.  However,  there  was
         considerable  force  in  Mr   O'Callaghan's   argument   that   the
         investigation of both the appellant and AW for money laundering had
         led to no charges being laid against them. Mr  Has  describes  what
         happened in his statement[138]. The appellant and AW were  arrested
         on 27 November 2013 in relation to an investigation into the use of
         A Cars Ltd for money laundering purposes. The  period  investigated
         ran from July 2007 to April 2013. The �7,000 seized in a search  of
         [the property at 52] was returned because it was established it did
         not belong to the appellant or AW. On  27  November  2014  the  NCA
         wrote to Mr Has to say there was insufficient evidence to provide a
         realistic prospect of conviction. In other words, an  investigation
         lasting a whole year into an 8-year period did not yield sufficient
         evidence to found a charge. In the circumstances, we  do  not  find
         the evidence suggests  it  is  more  probable  than  not  that  the
         appellant has hidden his wealth. Indeed, the fact AW has been  made
         bankrupt over what was originally a fairly  insignificant  debt  is
         not consistent with such an inference being drawn.

    111. One matter which did concern us was the appellant's evidence to us,
         given  in  cross-examination  on  12  April,  about  his   business
         activities. The appellant confirmed that he set up a  new  business
         in around 2013 in partnership with D and two others on the basis he
         could give a personal guarantee  for  �80,000  credit  provided  by
         someone called Umit so that goods could be purchased[139].  If  the
         business failed,  he  said,  he  could  re-mortgage  his  property.
         Pressed to explain why the suppliers  would  provide  goods  if  it
         could not be shown that the credit would be honoured, the appellant
         said that the supplier would vouch for him. However, he accepted he
         had no connection to  the  supplier  at  the  time  he  offered  to
         guarantee the credit. Asked to explain how, as a car dealer, he was
         able to  obtain  credit  in  this  way,  the  appellant's  evidence
         floundered. He referred to knowing a lot of  people,  being  social
         and having connections in the community.

    112. We recall the appellant's evidence to us that  his  finances  "went
         downhill" from 2009 onwards. That is inconsistent with his  account
         of being able, as a simple car salesman and low-key businessman, to
         secure large amounts of credit on nothing more  than  his  word  to
         fund business arrangements across Turkey and  Europe.  We  consider
         the appellant's credibility was undermined by this area  of  cross-
         examination and  we  draw  an  inference  that  the  appellant  has
         presented an incomplete picture of his business dealings.

    113. Additionally, in questions from us at the end of his oral evidence,
         the appellant appeared to retreat from  his  earlier  evidence.  We
         pointed out that his account of being in mortgage arrears  did  not
         sit easily with his claim he could meet his obligations as a credit
         guarantor by re-mortgaging  his  house.  He  then  said  that  this
         happened before he had money problems. His problems had  only  been
         in the last three or four years.  That  contradicted  his  evidence
         that his financial problems started in 2009.

    114. Our view was fortified to an extent by the  appellant's  subsequent
         evidence that he receives  a  share  of  the  profits  of  a  large
         commercial building in Istanbul but this income  is  not  deposited
         into his account. It is now paid into the account of AB1's wife. We
         found the appellant's responses to Mr Hall's  questions  about  why
         other  money  is  paid  into  AW's  account  rather  than  his  own
         unimpressive. It was  clear  to  us  that  the  appellant  was  not
         prepared to provide an accurate picture of his circumstances.

    115. We have carefully considered whether these findings should lead  us
         to conclude that the appellant might be hiding his wealth. However,
         on balance,  we  have  concluded  that  they  do  not.  Whilst  the
         appellant might not be prepared to be entirely frank and open about
         his business dealings and associations, we still do not believe  he
         would allow his home to be put at risk and  his  wife's  health  to
         suffer over a debt which he could manage to repay but  prefers  not
         to in order to provide a smokescreen for his true activities. Given
         his family's name  and  reputation,  it  is  likely  the  appellant
         benefits from  a  certain  notoriety  which  enables  him  to  make
         connections and introductions  within  the  Kurdish  community.  We
         cannot speculate but this might also account  for  his  ability  to
         guarantee credit whilst not having any capital  assets  to  provide
         security.

The purchase of a lake
    116. XY believes that the appellant's intended purchase of  a  lake  and
         land in Oxfordshire in 1998 was being funded by money from the  OCG
         because the  deal  fell  through  when  the  family's  assets  were
         frozen[140]. This showed the appellant was actively involved in the
         OCG. The appellant was recorded by a probe describing  how  he  was
         "hit by that operation"[141]. XY contrasts the  appellant's  access
         to large amounts of money with his evidence at his  trial  in  2015
         that he had to abandon his studies because he was impecunious[142].
         The appellant states in his first statement  that  he  discontinued
         his studies in 2000 and that XY had got his  dates  wrong[143].  Mr
         O'Callaghan  put  this  to  XY  at  the  beginning  of  his  cross-
         examination. XY explained he was not suggesting the  appellant  was
         lying when he said he could not proceed with the  purchase  because
         of the family's  assets  being  seized.  The  point  was  that  the
         appellant's ability to buy a lake was not in keeping  with  student
         life. He accepted that not all the assets that were seized were the
         proceeds of crime and some were returned to  the  family.  However,
         the majority were seized.


    117. We find  the  appellant  was  at  cross-purposes  with  XY  in  his
         statement and the point XY had been trying to make in his statement
         was that it was highly suspicious that a student, who  subsequently
         had to abandon his MBA studies due  to  lack  of  funds,  had  been
         contemplating the purchase of a large area of land and a lake  with
         a view to developing the site. It is clear to us  that,  until  the
         asset seizure, the appellant had access to the family's money, much
         of which was found to be the proceeds of crime. He has not  offered
         an explanation for this. However, the case we  are  considering  is
         that the appellant is the head of the OCG and this  evidence  shows
         at most only that  he  potentially  benefited  from  the  financial
         backing which his brothers provided. It has not been suggested  the
         appellant was not a  genuine  student  while  he  was  enrolled  on
         courses and we find it unlikely that he could pursue studies at the
         same time as contribute substantially to running an OCG.

A Cars Ltd
    118. XY's evidence to us was that he  believes  the  appellant  operates
         this business as a "front' for his OCG activities. In the course of
         investigations the authorities had searched both [the  property  at
         52], where the business operates from, and [the property at 56].  A
         number of documents had been seized.  We  have  had  sight  of  the
         company's trading accounts prepared  by  Graham  Cohen  &  Co  Ltd,
         Accountants, from April 2005, when the business  was  incorporated,
         until April 2012[144]. Some of  the  probe  evidence  was  obtained
         through a device installed in [the property at 52]. XY accepted  in
         cross-examination he is not an expert in the car business.


    119. XY suggests the business does  trade  to  a  limited  extent  in  a
         legitimate  manner  but,  in  his  opinion,  does  not   have   the
         infrastructure that would be expected of a car sales business[145].
         For example, the company does not  appear  to  have  the  means  to
         advertise, there is no forecourt, business website or footprint  on
         any other website. The company is not registered for VAT, does  not
         have any employees or PAYE records. XY suggests the company  trades
         within a closed community of the appellant's associates  so  as  to
         give him cover as a legitimate businessman. XY has provided a table
         of AW's declared earnings taken  from  HMRC  records,  showing  her
         income from A Cars Ltd ranged from �5225  in  2007/8  to  �9600  in
         2012/13[146]. However, there are no corresponding credits  in  AW's
         bank statements.  The appellant confirms that AW receives a  salary
         of �800 from the company, which she does not necessarily  pay  into
         her bank account[147].

    120. The appellant has maintained  that  A  Cars  Ltd  is  a  legitimate
         business and he explains that the company not only buys  and  sells
         cars but the business also invests in  other  businesses[148].   He
         explains that the business is effectively  home-run.  He  built  an
         office at [the property at 52]  and  there  is  a  hardstanding  to
         accommodate cars. He does not need to  advertise  because  he  buys
         cars from salvage and auctions and  he  does  business  within  the
         trade. He arranges for the cars to be "fixed  up".  He  uses  other
         firms to sell the cars for him. The  VAT  threshold  has  not  been
         reached. The only employees are himself and AW.  The  appellant  is
         critical of XY's lack of understanding of the car trade.

    121. It was put to the appellant in cross-examination  that  he  uses  A
         Cars Ltd to conceal his OCG activities.  The appellant denied  this
         and reiterated that he is hard-up.

    122. In response to a letter from the appellant's solicitors,  which  we
         have not seen, Graham Cohen & Co Ltd has provided  some  additional
         documents relating  to  the  business,  such  as  some  handwritten
         invoices in respect of car rentals and commissions in 2011[149]. We
         have also been provided with what we assume to  be  photographs  of
         [the property at 52], showing a a single-storey gated property  and
         a number of vehicles parked within the yard and probably  invisible
         from the street[150].

    123. We have no expertise in the car sales business. We accept there are
         different types of business and there may be  other  markets  apart
         from the  traditional  visible  car  sales  business  which  has  a
         forecourt or showroom and which places advertisements online and in
         various publications. The respondent  accepts  the  appellant  does
         trade in second hand vehicles  and  the  probe  evidence  shows  in
         various places that the appellant has knowledge of  cars.  However,
         we were very surprised to hear from the appellant that he is unable
         to drive. Given he has no employees we were left to wonder  how  it
         is that he manages to move cars from place to  place  and  even  to
         park them at [the property at 52].

    124. In his second statement the appellant seeks to clarify that  he  is
         able to drive but has not held a  British  driving  licence  for  a
         variety of reasons[151]. The appellant has  supported  his  account
         with a letter from DVLA, dated  28  May  2014,  which  we  note  is
         addressed to  him  at  [the  property  at  3],  Edgware[152].  This
         evidence does little to detract from the point we have made that it
         is unlikely that a  serious  car  salesman  would  not  make  it  a
         priority to be able to drive.

    125. The figures show this is not  on,  the  face  of  it,  a  lucrative
         business. The accounts for the  year  ending  30  April  2013,  the
         latest we were shown, recorded a gross profit of �31,250 from which
         administrative  expenses  of  �29,629  were  deducted  leaving   an
         operating profit of �646[153]. The expenses  included  salaries  of
         �9,712 and director's remuneration of �9,712.  The  accounts  refer
         only to the cost of sales and make no  mention  of  other  business
         investments,  as  described  by  the  appellant  and  also  briefly
         confirmed in a letter from Graham Cohen &  Co  Ltd,  dated  3  June
         2016[154].

    126. It appeared to us that there was a similar degree of opacity to the
         appellant's evidence regarding the operation of A Cars Ltd as there
         had been to his evidence of the rental  income  derived  from  [the
         property at 52] and his ability to guarantee credit  on  behalf  of
         suppliers in Turkey. As noted, he maintained he  has  no  employees
         other than himself and AW but there is no evidence of  money  being
         paid into GB's bank account. A few bank statements in respect of  A
         Cars Ltd's HSBC account have  been  attached  to  the  letter  from
         Graham Cohen & Co Ltd. Even a cursory glance at  these  shows  that
         there were very few transactions.  In  our  judgment  they  do  not
         reflect the description of his business given by the  appellant  in
         his witness statement[155].  We  also  find  it  significant  that,
         whilst he explains the  limited  market  in  which  he  chooses  to
         operate, the appellant has not explained why he  chooses  to  limit
         his business in this way given there must be opportunities to  work
         more widely and therefore to grow the business. This is an  example
         of the appellant reacting with explanations to the case against him
         but not providing a convincing account of the bigger  picture.   On
         the one hand, he claims he is hard up. On the other,  he  seeks  to
         present himself as a serious businessman but does not  explain  why
         he has restricted his car sales business  to  an  extremely  narrow
         market.


    127. We were also struck by the absence of the kind  of  evidence  which
         ought to be readily available to support the appellant's account of
         running a legitimate car business. He gave evidence to  the  effect
         he is involved in numerous transactions to do with the  selling  on
         of cars and also rentals and storage. We saw no compelling evidence
         from the insurance brokers he  referred  to  or  from  any  of  his
         customers, trade or otherwise. We appreciate many of his  documents
         were seized. However, he has been on notice for a  long  time  that
         XY's evidence would be that the business  is  a  screen  for  other
         activities. The appellant has not  taken  steps  to  adduce  cogent
         evidence beyond  the  few  additional  documents  provided  by  his
         accountants.

    128. The appellant has sought to add to the portrait he gave us  of  his
         business activities at  the  hearing  by  adducing  fresh  evidence
         suggesting  he  has  been  involved  in  various   other   business
         projects[156].  Two  letters  from   fellow   businessmen   briefly
         confirming this have been provided[157]. The value  of  the  letter
         from R was diluted by the evidence handed up  by  Mr  Hall  showing
         that R was convicted on 15 December 2015 with others of  conspiring
         to commit four immigration offences. He was subsequently  sentenced
         to an absolute discharge because of his mental health problems.

    129. Again we find the appellant has reacted to challenges to his status
         as a legitimate businessman by adducing fresh evidence but we agree
         with Mr Hall that the effect of this is to  undermine  further  his
         account of running A Cars Ltd  as  a  legitimate  car  sales/rental
         business. The appellant's decision to file this evidence so late in
         the day means it could not be tested. We attach  little  weight  to
         it.

    130. Drawing these matters together we find that A Cars Ltd does operate
         in a legitimate matter but that it only "ticks over" and it has not
         been adequately explained why that should be the case. We are  sure
         the appellant has not provided a complete or  accurate  account  of
         his activities. On the other  hand,  the  lengthy  money-laundering
         investigation conducted by the  police  did  not  produce  evidence
         sufficient to prosecute the appellant or AW.  We  recall  that  the
         original allegation was  that  they  were  using  the  business  to
         launder money[158]. We are not able  to  find  on  the  balance  of
         probabilities  that  that   is   the   case   notwithstanding   our
         reservations about the appellant's evidence. These reservations are
         not sufficient, in our judgment, to infer the  appellant  uses  the
         business to provide him  with  a  cloak  of  legitimacy  whilst  he
         operates as head of an OCG. At its highest the evidence only  shows
         the appellant operates on the fringes of legality.


The evidence of AW
    131. AW gave brief evidence to adopt her statement  only[159].  She  was
         asked no additional questions by way  of  examination-in-chief  and
         she was not cross-examined. She explains in her statement that  she
         finds these proceedings stressful and we have noted  that  she  has
         been frail of health.  To  the  extent  her  evidence  records  the
         history of her relationship with the appellant  and  the  birth  of
         their son, we accept it. We also  accept  her  evidence  about  the
         appellant's relationship with his son.


    132. To the extent her evidence relates to the purchase  of  properties,
         the council tax debt on [the property at 52] and the running  of  A
         Cars, we accept that  she  has  been  directed  throughout  by  the
         appellant.  Her evidence has not  assisted  us  with  our  task  of
         deciding whether we accept the appellant's account or not.

The evidence of AS
    133. AS is married to AB3,  the  appellant's  older  brother.  She  gave
         evidence on behalf of the appellant.


    134. XY has provided probe evidence of a conversation between AS  and  B
         recorded in B's car on 12 February  2014[160].  In  the  course  of
         their conversation they discuss the appellant and  XY  opines  that
         the correct interpretation of this is that they are discussing  his
         criminality. For example, there is the following exchange:

         "O:  You see what we live with.
         AB:  I know your life is difficult.
            O:    If only A Abi could get his  passport  and  go.  Otherwise
             they are going to put him in prison I swear.
           AB:    Very difficult (unintelligible) even if  he  gets  it  and
             goes. If he lives like this it will be the  same  wherever  he
             goes. Unless he and AB3 change their lifestyle they will  have
             problems again."

    135. We note that AS accepts this conversation took place but she offers
         a different interpretation. She explains that she meant  that  both
         the appellant and her husband would have problems if they continued
         to involve themselves so much in the community. The  appellant  was
         often approached for advice[161].


    136. Cross-examined, she insisted that she had  been  shocked  that  her
         husband was found guilty and she denied being  aware  that  he  had
         been leading a bad lifestyle. She said he used to  help  people  in
         the community but not in a way she thought could lead him to end up
         in prison. Asked  about  the  transcript  referred  to  above,  she
         acknowledged that B had told  her  he  had  been  followed  by  the
         police. She denied ever wondering why he had been followed  by  the
         police. She  said  she  was  "paranoid"  about  being  watched.  In
         relation to the dialogue set out above, she refused to be drawn  as
         to why she had expressed a fear that the appellant might be sent to
         prison. She would only say that friends might tell lies  about  him
         but she would not say what sort of accusations she had in mind. She
         would not say who the bad people were that the appellant  ought  to
         keep away from.

    137. We found AS's evidence highly evasive.  We  agree  with  Mr  Hall's
         characterisation of her frequent resort to denying all knowledge as
         "Nelsonian blindness." We reject her claim set out in  her  witness
         statement that  she  feared  that  the  appellant  would  encounter
         problems from the community  because  he  was  too  ready  to  help
         people. We infer from her refusal to explain  what  she  had  meant
         that her concerns were that the appellant would end  up  in  prison
         because of his criminal activities. We place little reliance on her
         insistence that he was innocent but  that  bad  people  would  make
         false statements about him because, when pressed, she could tell us
         nothing about why she thought this.

    138. Another exchange relied on by XY goes as follows[162]:

            "O:   If we bought  a  house  our  name  will  also  be  cleared
             yenge[163]. I don't know what is going to happen.
         AB:  So are you saying you can't buy a  house  before  you  have  a
         clean name?
            O:    If I buy a house and the  state  come  one  day  and  says
             where did you bring the money from, what am I going to say? If
             they say where did you bring the money from.
           AB:    Of course you have to have an official income.
           O: That's it, I don't have an official  income  or  anything.  We
             have nothing. We have to do something.
           AB:    A grocery store or  something.  I  don't  know  something.
             Your income has to be out in  the  open.  It  comes  and  goes
             there. Are you not thinking about something like that?
            O:  We  are  looking  yenge.  Wherever  (unintelligible)  we  do
             something official it goes wrong. We can't  do  with  official
             things. It goes under straight away. So went shops went under.
           AB:    I don't know if you did it with reliable people they  will
             not go down. (unintelligible)
           O: (unintelligible)
           AB:    Those around you are rotten. As long as those  around  you
             are rotten, you will rot it/them.
           O: Willingly or not you rot amongst it, one  would  get  lost  in
             it. If there are one or two clean ones, they disappear amongst
             them. I ensure you they disappear/get lost."

    139. In her statement AS denies that she was discussing money laundering
         with B. She says was suggesting he set up a  business  legitimately
         so  that  he  could  make  a  mortgage  application[164].  She  was
         assisting him to find a property to buy with his partner.

    140. Cross-examined, she said she did not  know  how  B  was  earning  a
         living when she had the conversation with him.  She denied  knowing
         him well. She denied knowing that B was a car dealer  and  that  he
         bought cars from the appellant, as the appellant had told  us.  She
         denied knowing that B was spending time with  criminals  and  would
         not explain what she had meant by "rotten people". She said she was
         not really describing anyone.

    141. Again we found AS's refusal to answer questions about what she  had
         meant undermined her claim that the conversation  had  an  innocent
         explanation and was misinterpreted by XY. We see no reason why  she
         should not have been able to answer Mr Hall's questions if it  were
         really the case that she knew nothing about B. We find her  account
         impossible to reconcile with the transcript, the clear  meaning  of
         which is that she was advising B to operate a  legitimate  business
         as a front. The plain meaning  of  the  conversation  is  that  B's
         activities were not legitimate and AS knew this.  Of  course,  that
         part of the conversation  was  exclusively  about  B  and  did  not
         involve the appellant.

Prison visits
    142. The final part of XY's evidence which we wish to refer  to  is  his
         confirmation of  the  criminality  of  some  of  the  visitors  who
         attended  HMP  Belmarsh  while  the  appellant  was   remanded   in
         custody[165]. He lists their names and  records  their  convictions
         and non-convictions, taken from the PNCs. There are 17  individuals
         on the list. XY acknowledges that some of the offences might not be
         considered to be at the upper levels of criminality. However,  some
         were very serious and it is notable how  many  of  the  appellant's
         visitors have criminal records. The appellant's evidence in  cross-
         examination that he had no  control  over  who  visits  him  hardly
         addresses the clear implication of this evidence, which is that  he
         has a large number of associates who commit crime,  in  some  cases
         very serious crime. There can be no doubt that  the  appellant  has
         many acquaintances who have convictions.


    143. However, there are limitations as to the effect of  this  evidence.
         One of the visitors listed turns out to be a  magistrate.  We  were
         struck by Mr O'Callaghan's cross-examination  of  XY  which  showed
         that restrictions  on  visits  to  prisoners  on  remand  are  less
         rigorous than on visits to convicted prisoners but also that prison
         governors have powers to exclude undesirable visitors, particularly
         at HMP Belmarsh. In other words, we are asked  to  infer  that  the
         prison authorities were not on the face of it  concerned  that  the
         appellant might be conducting meetings in order to continue running
         the OCG.  There are no transcripts of  those  meetings.  We  cannot
         infer from the fact the appellant  met  with  several  people  with
         criminal records of various degrees of seriousness, even looking at
         the evidence in the round, that he was likely to be running the OCG
         from inside HMP Belmarsh. It cannot be the case, as  he  maintained
         in cross-examination, that his good name is important to him if  he
         associates with people who  are  frequently  in  trouble  with  the
         police. Whilst this evidence fits  with  our  impression  that  the
         appellant has many associations with criminals  we  cannot  say  it
         takes the matter very far in terms of establishing that he  is  the
         head of the OCG.

The appellant's involvement in the OCG - conclusions
    144. We now attempt to draw together the various findings we  have  made
         in order to reach a conclusion about the appellant's  role  in  the
         OCG.


    145. Mr Hall argued that a journey consisting of three evidential stages
         should lead to the conclusion he sought, namely that the  appellant
         is the head of the OCG.


    146. The first step is to acknowledge that the OCG has existed for  many
         years. As we have said at paragraph 34 (above),  we  find  as  fact
         that there has been an OCG. At  least  during  the  time  that  the
         appellant's brothers were at large, this operated so as  to  import
         huge quantities of drugs to the UK, as well as to engage  in  other
         serious crime involving  blackmail,  kidnapping  and  very  serious
         violence. This  takes  matters  up  to  around  2011.  We  find  it
         significant that there is nothing in the evidence  to  support  the
         view that the appellant has ever been involved in  the  importation
         of drugs or of any drug offences at all. Mr  O'Callaghan  drew  our
         attention to the probe evidence, which should be  dated  7  January
         2014, in which B confirms the appellant does not want  anything  to
         do with drugs[166]. Nor does the evidence suggest at any point that
         the OCG is currently involved in the drugs trade. We believe  that,
         if it were the case that the appellant,  B  or  any  of  the  other
         persons recorded were involved in the drugs trade, there would have
         been something in the three years' surveillance material to confirm
         this. It appears clear to us that, whatever became of the OCG after
         the imprisonment of  the  appellants'  brothers,  it  has  probably
         ceased to engage in the drugs trade.


    147. We note the phrasing of Mr Hall's first stage test, which asks  the
         question in the past tense. We accept there has been an OCG but  we
         think it is important to ask whether it continues in operation and,
         if so, to what extent it continues to operate. We found this a  far
         more difficult question to answer. The drugs trade  was  clearly  a
         major part of its operations in the past. XY's belief appears to be
         that the OCG continues to operate  through  its  extortion  racket.
         Some of the transcript evidence can  be  read  as  reflecting  XY's
         theory. There are also references to  people  being  identified  as
         "As"[167], which the  appellant  could  not  explain  convincingly.
         However, we accept such references do not  necessarily  show  there
         was an active OCG.  B  could  have  been  referring  to  historical
         loyalties rather than these necessarily  being  references  to  the
         appellant. We have kept an open mind about the possibility that the
         OCG continues in some reduced form.

    148. Mr Hall's second stage is to find that  the  appellant  is  closely
         associated with a number  of  individuals  from  the  North  London
         Turkish community with convictions for serious criminal offences. B
         and Care given as examples.

    149. We find as fact that the appellant has many close associations with
         people with criminal records. This is plain from the  papers  as  a
         whole and also admissions made by the appellant in his evidence  to
         us. We find the  appellant's  insistence  that  his  good  name  is
         important to him very difficult to reconcile with his associations,
         his denial of having any knowledge of organised criminal groups and
         his admission that he knew that people he associated with had guns.
         We place particular reliance on his close association with  B,  who
         has very serious convictions. We noted that the appellant was in  a
         car with B on the night of the shooting and also the next  day.  We
         do not accept they simply knew each other through the community  or
         through their joint participation in the car  trade.  The  recorded
         conversations between B and AS and also B and C indicate that there
         is a close association between the appellant and B. We noted B  was
         present at the meeting with D on 31 January 2014  even  though,  as
         far as we  can  see,  B  was  not  involved  with  the  Bournemouth
         enterprise. The appellant's claim to have broken off relations with
         B when he realised what he had done appeared to  us  to  be  highly
         contrived. We accept XY's  depiction  of  B  as  a  violent  career
         criminal. We noted the appellant's admission  that  B  used  the  A
         name.


    150. Mr Hall's third stage is that the appellant is the head of the OCG.
          He relies on the evidence of B and C  discussing  remuneration,  B
         appearing to take orders from "abi",  who  is  the  appellant,  the
         appellant giving orders to B to fight back after the  shooting  and
         the evidence of XY that he had not come across B working for anyone
         else. Mr Hall also relies on the evidence given at the trial of  G,
         the appellant's discussion of how to become  "immortal",  security-
         conscious behaviour and the obscurity of the appellant's  financial
         situation. We have carefully considered all of these  points  above
         in our discussion of the evidence. They are all matters capable  of
         being interpreted so as to support XY's beliefs about the appellant
         which are,  in  turn,  based  on  his  professional  experience  of
         organised crime. We have endeavoured  to  explain  the  basis  upon
         which we have been able to attach weight to them or not.

    151. We have also considered Mr O'Callaghan's  closing  submissions.  We
         have taken note of his general point that the  probe  evidence  was
         obtained  as  part  of   "Operation   Accountant",   which   lasted
         approximately three years.  Whilst  a  fair  amount  of  transcript
         evidence has been produced, it can be safely assumed that  hundreds
         or even  thousands  of  hours  of  recordings  yielded  nothing  of
         interest. Mr O'Callaghan argued that the few  hours  of  transcript
         evidence ultimately relied on by the  respondent  cannot  bear  the
         weight which she seeks to load on them as showing the appellant  is
         the head of the OCG. He also argued that we should infer  from  the
         non-disclosure of  much  of  the  documentation  seized  that  they
         contain nothing of interest in these proceedings.

    152. In our judgment, the most troubling part of the  evidence  concerns
         the appellant's close association with B, who is known to be a loan
         shark and drug dealer. He uses an  armoured  car.  He  moved  house
         after being shot at. He is  now  serving  a  lengthy  sentence.  Mr
         O'Callaghan described the appellant's relationship with  B  as  the
         "fulcrum" of the respondent's case. We agree it is a  central  part
         of it. However, as said, the respondent's case only succeeds if  it
         is shown that B  acts  as  the  appellant's  subordinate.  For  the
         reasons given, we are unable to find that is the case. B  certainly
         acts subserviently towards the appellant and  talks  about  him  to
         others as if he holds authority within the community.  However,  it
         is telling that the CPS did not find there was sufficient  evidence
         to prosecute the appellant in connection with the kidnap  plot.  It
         is also reasonably clear that B recognises the appellant  does  not
         approve of drugs dealing. We have found the probe evidence does not
         show with probability that the appellant was giving orders to B  to
         exact revenge following the shooting. If  he  did,  the  unanswered
         question arises of why no retaliatory action was taken.  Again,  if
         there were a chain of command of  the  kind  described  by  XY,  we
         consider it is likely that three  years'  surveillance  would  have
         revealed far more in the way of examples of orders being given  and
         reported on.


    153. It has not been shown that, at least as far as the UK is concerned,
         the appellant holds significant assets. He is unable to dispose  of
         any of the three properties which are registered in  his  name.  He
         has unpaid mortgages on two  of  them  and  other  debts.  For  the
         reasons we have given above we do not find it is  likely  that  the
         appellant has successfully hidden his wealth. A Cars Ltd ticks over
         as a going concern but is plainly not the appellant's main means of
         supporting himself and his family. We are sure he  is  involved  in
         many business arrangements of different kinds and that we have only
         been given a partial insight into these. On the other hand, it  has
         not been shown that the business was used to launder money.  We  do
         not consider the appellant to have given  truthful  evidence  about
         his precise circumstances. However, neither are we satisfied by the
         available evidence that the appellant enjoys  the  lifestyle  which
         might be considered consistent with his being the head of an OCG.

    154. To conclude, we find there has been an OCG. There may  still  be  a
         reduced version of that organisation in  existence.  The  appellant
         may trade on the notoriety of the name he has  inherited.  However,
         despite our numerous misgivings concerning the appellant's  overall
         veracity, we are not satisfied that it is more  probable  than  not
         that the appellant is the head of the OCG.

Decision
    155. We now apply the law to our findings.  The  respondent's  power  to
         deport foreign nationals is derived from  section  3(5)(a)  of  the
         Immigration Act 1971 but, in the case of EEA  nationals  and  their
         family members,  the  governing  principles  are  to  be  found  in
         Regulations 19 and 21 of the EEA Regulations, which  were  designed
         to transpose into domestic law the provisions of  articles  27,  28
         and 29 of Directive  2004/38/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and
         Council, of 29 April 2004 ("the Citizens' Directive").


    156. The EEA Regulations read as follows in relevant part:


         "Permanent right of residence

         15. (1) The following persons shall acquire the right to reside  in
         the United Kingdom permanently-

         (a)...

         (b)a family member of an EEA national who is  not  himself  an  EEA
         national but who has resided in the United  Kingdom  with  the  EEA
         national in accordance with  these  Regulations  for  a  continuous
         period of five years;




         Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom

         19.

         ...

         (3) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5),  an  EEA  national  who  has
         entered the United Kingdom or the family member of such a  national
         who has entered the United Kingdom may be removed if -

         ...

         (b)the Secretary of State has decided that the person's removal  is
         justified on grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
         health in accordance with regulation 21;





         Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public health
         grounds

         21. (1) In this regulation  a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in  respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.

         (4) ...

         (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

         (a)the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;

         (b)the decision must be based exclusively on the  personal  conduct
         of the person concerned;

         (c)the personal conduct of the person concerned  must  represent  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
         the fundamental interests of society;

         (d)matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or  which
         relate to considerations of general prevention do not  justify  the
         decision;

         (e)a person's previous criminal convictions do  not  in  themselves
         justify the decision.

         (6) Before taking a relevant decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin."




    157. We remind ourselves that the respondent accepts the  appellant  has
         acquired  a  permanent  right  of  residence.  His  case  therefore
         attracts the additional protection provided by Regulation 21(3) and
         "serious grounds of public policy or public security" must be shown
         before the appellant's removal is lawful.


    158. In Bah (EO (Turkey) liability to deport) [2012] UKUT 196 (IAC)  the
         former President of  the  Upper  Tribunal  gave  guidance,  in  the
         context of a conducive deportation appeal, to the effect  that  the
         Tribunal had not erred in permitting the Secretary of State to rely
         on evidence of conduct falling short of criminal  convictions.  The
         assessment should be forward looking.


    159. At the  beginning  of  these  proceedings  we  were  provided  with
         detailed skeleton arguments setting  out  the  law  and  an  agreed
         bundle  of  authorities.  We  are  grateful  for  this  assistance.
         However, when it came to closing submissions,  the  representatives
         were agreed that this  appeal  resolves  itself  according  to  our
         finding of fact with regard to whether the appellant is the head of
         the OCG or not. Mr Hall's core submission  was  that  the  evidence
         showed this to be  the  case  and  therefore,  notwithstanding  the
         protections  offered  by  Regulation  21,   the   public   interest
         prevailed. Mr O'Callaghan's core submission was that  the  evidence
         fell short of showing the appellant was the head of the OCG but, in
         the event we found he was, then his removal would be justified  and
         proportionate. Family life considerations and the best interests of
         the child would not outweigh the public  interest.  We  found  this
         approach very helpful and we have not found it necessary to set out
         the law any further.

    160. In the light of this agreed approach, we need  only  refer  to  our
         conclusion that, on the available evidence, we are not able  to  be
         satisfied that it is more probable than not that the  appellant  is
         the head  of  the  OCG.  Accordingly,  the  appellant's  appeal  is
         allowed.

Anonymity

    161. Mr O'Callaghan sought an order for an extension  of  the  anonymity
         direction granted at the case management review hearing  so  as  to
         include any reference  to  the  A  name.   We  indicated  we  would
         consider this at the end of the hearing.


    162. Mr O'Callaghan argued that anonymity was appropriate to protect the
         interests of the appellant's child. There  was  a  possibility  his
         friends would search the internet and the results would make a link
         between his family and organised crime. Mr Hall argued that it  was
         not appropriate to make an anonymity direction in this case because
         the interests of open justice prevailed. These were weighty matters
         which were not displaced in this case. He pointed out  that  the  A
         name is already in the public domain. The appellant had been  tried
         in public using his name. Mr O'Callaghan pointed out that this case
         was not a continuation of what was already in the media relating to
         this appellant. That material referred to the appellant's brothers.




    163. We gave this matter careful consideration and  we  also  considered
         the effect of our allowing the appeal[168]. Having done so we  have
         concluded  that  it  is  not  appropriate  to  make  any  anonymity
         direction in this case. The direction made at the  case  management
         review hearing is revoked and no further directions are  made.  Our
         reasons are as follows.

    164. Our starting-point is that there is weighty public interest in open
         justice. In Application by Guardian News and Media Ltd  and  others
         in HM Treasury v Mohammed Jabar Ahmed &  Ors  [2010]  UKSC  1,  the
         Supreme Court considered the  "recent  efflorescence  of  anonymity
         orders"  prior  to  which  the  general  rule  was  that   judicial
         proceedings were held in public  and  the  parties  were  named  in
         judgments[169]. The Court set out the correct test as being whether
         there was sufficient,  general  public  interest  in  publishing  a
         report  of  proceedings  which  identifies  a  party   to   justify
         curtailing that party and his  family's  right  to  a  private  and
         family life[170].  When conducting the balancing exercise, there is
         a "powerful, general public interest" in  identifying  a  party  in
         important proceedings[171].

    165. We remind the parties that the decisions of this Tribunal  are  not
         reported. However, we understand the appellant's concern  that,  if
         the press obtained a copy of this decision, it might wish to report
         it given the notoriety of the A name. The  appellant's  concern  is
         that this might lead to his son  being  associated  with  organised
         crime,   thereby   potentially   damaging   his   reputation    and
         relationships. Article 8 is clearly engaged. The  appellant  points
         out he was acquitted at his trial and, as seen, we have allowed his
         appeal.

    166. However, we agree with Mr Hall that the A name is  already  in  the
         public domain as the sheaf of press article produced by  XY  shows.
         Moreover, the appellant gave evidence  in  three  appeals  in  this
         Tribunal in his own name without this having had  any  consequences
         for his son. Likewise, his trial was public and his  name  was  not
         withheld without there being any adverse consequences for his  son.
         In our judgment, this shows the prospect of the kind of harm  which
         concerns the appellant occurring is extremely remote and is heavily
         outweighed by the public interest in ensuring that justice is  seen
         to be done.
