Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr David Clark, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr K Alim (Counsel)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department to whom I shall refer throughout  as  "the  claimant".   The
    respondent is a citizen of Jamaica born on 19th June, 1982.

Immigration History

2.   The respondent was issued with an entry clearance visa by  the  British
    High Commission in Jamaica on  18th  May,  1982.   This  visa  was  for
    settlement with his mother who is settled in the United  Kingdom.   The
    respondent entered the United  Kingdom  on  23rd  July,  1992  and  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain.

3.   On 7th March, 2002 the respondent's former girlfriend, [SB] gave  birth
    to their son, [ML].  [ML]'s  birth  certificate  indicated  that  their
    parents  lived  at  separate  addresses.   On  22nd  April,  2003   the
    respondent married [ZT].  She gave  birth  to  their  daughter  in  the
    United Kingdom on 29th October, 2003.

4.   [ZT] was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain on  the  basis
    of her marriage to the respondent.  The  respondent  has  since  stated
    that following DNA tests he has discovered that he is not the father of
    the daughter [ZT] gave birth to in October 2003.  On 20th October, 2004
    [SB} gave birth to her second son  [TL].   The  respondent's  name  was
    entered as the father and the same two  addresses  recorded  in  [ML]'s
    birth certificate were recorded in [TL]'s birth certificate.

The Respondent's Conviction

5.   On 22nd June, 2011 the respondent was convicted  at  Wood  Green  Crown
    Court  of  conspiracy  to  fraudulently  evade  a  prohibition  on  the
    importation of a class A  drug  and  conspiracy  to  supply  controlled
    drugs.  He was sentenced by the same court on 6th October, 2011 to  two
    concurrent terms of five years' imprisonment.  Following his conviction
    he was served with form ICD0350 AD on 14th October, 2014.

6.   The claimant issued a deportation decision letter  on  10th  September,
    2013 and in it noted that under Section 32(5) of the  UK  Borders  Act,
    2007, she must make  a  deportation  order  in  respect  of  a  foreign
    criminal who has been convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence and
    who has been sentenced to a period of at least  twelve  months,  unless
    the foreign national falls within one of  the  exceptions  set  out  in
    Section 33 of the Act.  The Secretary  of  State  did  not  accept  the
    respondent's claims of enjoying a family life with his two sons and did
    not accept, therefore,  that  the  claimant  fell  within  one  of  the
    exceptions set out in Section 33 of the Act.

7.   The claimant noted that the respondent had been convicted  following  a
    trial for his part in the importation of just under 600 grams  of  pure
    heroin with a street value of in excess of �100,000.

Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

8.   The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and  his  appeal  was
    heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio sitting with Mrs Sheila Hewitt.
     At paragraph 58 of the panel's determination they said this:-

         "We initially told the representatives that as the law had  changed
         the present  terminology  under  paragraph  398  [of  Statement  of
         Changes in Immigration Rules  HC  395,  as  amended]  is  now  very
         compelling circumstances.  However, we have considered the  Reasons
         for Refusal Letter and the date of decision and note that  the  law
         applicable at the date of the [claimant's] decision is as quoted in
         the Reasons for Refusal Letter.  The [respondent] is therefore  not
         affected by the subsequent change in law on 28th July,  2014  which
         states that the new threshold is very compelling circumstances.  We
         therefore have to consider applying paragraph 398 whether there are
         exceptional circumstances in the [respondent's] case to the  extent
         that the public interest in deporting him  will  be  outweighed  by
         other factors."

9.   The Tribunal went on to allow the respondent's appeal.

10.  The claimant sought and was granted permission to appeal on  the  basis
    that the panel has misdirected itself by failing to take  into  account
    the changes to the legislation introduced  on  28th  July,  2014  which
    altered   the   wording   of   paragraph   398(c)   from   "exceptional
    circumstances" to "very exceptional circumstances".  So that  paragraph
    398 now reads as follows:-

         "398 where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
             to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of  the  Human  Rights
             Convention, and paragraph

             (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good and in the public  interest  because  they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they had  been
                  sentenced to a period of at least four years;

             (b)  the deportation of a person from the UK is  conducive  to
                  the public good and in the public interests  because  they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  convicted to a period of imprisonment of  less  than  four
                  years but at least twelve months; or

             (c)  the deportation of a person from the UK is  conducive  to
                  the public good and in the public interest because, in the
                  view of the Secretary of State, their offending has caused
                  serious harm or they are a persistent offender who shows a
                  particular disregard for the law,

             The Secretary of State in assessing the  claim  will  consider
             whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the
             public interest in deportation  will  only  be  outweighed  by
             other factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances
             over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A  [my
             emphasis]."

11.  The Secretary of State also complained that the panel  erred  in  their
    interpretation of "unduly harsh" and at paragraphs 59 to 65  failed  to
    give adequate reasons  why  they  believed  that  the  removal  of  the
    respondent to have an "unduly harsh" impact on  his  children  if  they
    were to remain in the United Kingdom without him.  The  fact  that  the
    respondent's conviction was for five years meant that the Tribunal  had
    to look at whether there were any very  compelling  circumstances  over
    and above those described in paragraphs  399  and  399A  which  it  had
    clearly not done.

12.  In addressing me, Mr  David  Clark  a  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer on behalf of the claimant told me that  the  panel  had  simply
    applied the wrong law.  YM (Uganda) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1292 was relied on.  The First-tier Tribunal
    heard the respondent's appeal on 9th September,  2015  and  promulgated
    their determination on 5th October, 2015.  The self-direction given  by
    the panel at paragraph 56 of its determination was simply incorrect and
    the wrong test had been applied.  That, suggested Mr Clark infected the
    whole of the determination.

13.  At paragraph 65 of the  determination  the  panel  refer  to  and  take
    account of the fact that they regard the respondent as being  reformed.
    That is not something that they should have concerned  themselves  with
    following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Danso  v  SSHD  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 596 where, at paragraph 20 the court said:-

         "20. ... It must be borne in mind, however, that the protection  of
             the public from harm by way of future offending is only one of
             the factors that makes it conducive  to  the  public  good  to
             deport criminals.  Other factors include the need to mark  the
             public's revulsion at the offender's conduct and the  need  to
             deter others from  acting  in  a  similar  way.   Fortunately,
             rehabilitation of the kind exhibited by the appellant in  this
             case is not uncommon and cannot in my view contribute  greatly
             to the existence of the very compelling circumstances required
             to outweigh the public interest in deportation."

14.  Mr Alim sought to rely on the  Rule  24  response  and  suggested  that
    there was no error of law.  He reminded  me  that  the  respondent  was
    father to [ML] who was now aged 13 years.  One  compelling  feature  of
    the appellant's background is that he entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    1992 with  leave.   He  urged  me  to  find  that  there  would  be  an
    exceptional and compelling impact on [ML] by the respondent's  removal.
    He also suggested that the Secretary of State had erred by  failing  to
    make any reference to the children's champion when considering the best
    interests of the children.  He  said  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    letter made no reference to the matter  having  been  referred  to  the
    children's champion.  He urged me to remit the appeal to the First-tier
    Tribunal in the event that I found an error of law.

15.  I am satisfied that the Tribunal did  err  by  misdirecting  itself  at
    paragraph 56 of its determination and not giving effect to  the  change
    in paragraph 398 following the  introduction  of  the  Immigration  Act
    2014.  I believe that that error on the part of the panel has  infected
    the whole of the determination.

16.  At paragraph 59 the Tribunal said this

         "59. We now go ahead to discuss the exceptional circumstances.   We
             find as a fact on the evidence before us that the [respondent]
             does not have any relationship with any partner in the  United
             Kingdom.  There is no satisfactory evidence before us on  this
             even though the [respondent] says he has a  relationship  with
             someone called [S], however, [S] did not attend court and  the
             only word we have is that  of  the  [respondent].   We  cannot
             accept that as satisfactory in such a  situation  particularly
             bearing in mind that it has to  be  exceptional  circumstances
             that  will  outweigh  the  deportation  of  the  [respondent].
             Although there are some discrepancies with regard to  some  of
             the living  arrangements  between  the  [respondent]  and  his
             former partner [SB] we accept on the totality of the  evidence
             before us that the [respondent] has been put down as the  main
             carer for his first son [ML] from the time he moved  into  the
             Amber Project this is as far  back  as  2002.   Furthermore  a
             residence order under Section 8 of the Children's Act 1989 was
             made on 29th April, 2003 in which the [respondent] was granted
             a residence order that his child [ML]  shall  live  with  him.
             That has been the case ever since and the resident's order has
             not been revoked.  We note the recommendations  of  the  local
             authority in which they noted that it was the right order  for
             [ML] because his father i.e. [the respondent] has demonstrated
             he is capable of meeting the  child's  needs  and  this  would
             ensure that [ML] grows up with  his  father  in  the  paternal
             family and not have to suffer the potential stigma of being in
             care.  We note that despite the  fact  that  the  [respondent]
             went to prison and was sentenced to five  years'  imprisonment
             the residence order has  not  been  revoked.   We  accept  the
             evidence that  [ML]  stayed  with  the  [respondent's]  mother
             during the time the [respondent] was in prison  and  since  he
             has been out of prison and out of immigration detention he has
             continued to be [ML]'s  main  carer.   The  evidence  we  have
             before us shows that [ML]'s mother plays very little if at all
             any significant part in [ML]'s life.  Other than the  evidence
             that [ML] went to spend a weekend with his mother due  to  the
             fact that he  was  missing  his  brother  there  is  no  other
             evidence before us that shows that [ML]'s mother is in regular
             contact with [ML].  This is the evidence which  was  given  by
             the [respondent], the [respondent's] mother even though  there
             was an element of discrepancy in her evidence but it  was  not
             significant overall on the evidence of [CS] whose evidence  we
             found extremely  helpful  with  regard  to  the  care  of  the
             [respondent's] children.  She has been very much  involved  in
             dropping the [respondent's] son at home after the holiday with
             her.  Her own daughter also attends the same school  with  the
             [respondent's]  son.    She   displayed   knowledge   of   the
             [respondent] looking after [ML] and she has  spent  time  with
             both children.  She is the girlfriend  of  the  [respondent's]
             brother.  We accept her evidence as credible as set out  under
             the hearing section.  We do not find  the  discrepancies  with
             regard to the  gaps  when  the  [respondent]  and  [SB]  lived
             together or for how long they lived together with  regards  to
             the care of [ML] as  it  was  quite  clear  that  the  overall
             evidence before us shows that  the  [respondent]  is  the  key
             figure in the upbringing of his  son  [ML]  without  which  he
             would not have been able to have any decent  upbringing.   The
             evidence before us which is confirmed  by  the  [respondent's]
             mother and [CS] is that since  the  [respondent's]  release  a
             dramatic change in the behaviour of [ML] has been noted.   The
             same applies to his brother [TL] the children look both calmer
             and happier and their behaviour  has  changed.   The  evidence
             from [CS] noted how [ML] was withdrawn when his father was  in
             prison.  With regard to [TL] he became aggressive and  had  to
             be removed from the main stream and put into a  special  needs
             school.  There  is  a  letter  from  a  child  and  adolescent
             psychotherapist in doctoral training by the name of  Ms  Anne-
             Marie Wedd who states that  she  has  been  working  with  the
             [respondent's] 10 year old son [TL] for over three  years  and
             knows that the [respondent] is a very important person in  his
             son's life and that [TL] spends weekends and holidays with the
             children and [TL] has  visited  his  father  when  he  was  in
             prison.  The professional noted that the [respondent] and  his
             son have a close and loving relationship  and  she  is  in  no
             doubt that should the [respondent] not be able to stay in  the
             country  the  disruption  of  that  relationship  could   have
             devastating consequences to the mental wellbeing of his son."

17.  The panel went on at paragraph 60 to say:-

         "With regard to [ML] there is a letter  dated  3rd  September  2015
         confirming that the [respondent] is the first point of contact  for
         [ML]  and  corresponds  with  the  school  in  regards  to   [ML]'s
         behaviour, attendance and academic progress  and  he  also  attends
         parents' evenings and meetings.  It  is  noted  that  [ML]  has  an
         attendance of 99.5% for the last academic year.  We therefore  find
         that despite certain elements of discrepancies which exist  in  the
         evidence concerning the particular addresses where the [respondent]
         lived or at what time he lived with [SB] the fact remains that  the
         impact of the  [respondent]  in  his  children's  lives  cannot  be
         undermined in any way."

18.  At paragraphs 64 and 65 are where the panel reached  their  conclusions
    in respect of finding "exceptional circumstances".

         "64. We accept that the [respondent] has family life with  [TL]  as
             well as with [ML].  He is playing a key role  in  their  lives
             without which it would be most devastating where the  children
             would be by now.  It is  quite  clear  according  to  all  the
             evidence before us that removing the [respondent] from the  UK
             would bring about interference with the family  life  that  he
             has with his two children but  more  so  it  is  the  negative
             impact that would be on both children's lives.  When  he  went
             to prison one was withdrawn and the other was  aggressive  and
             one child  had  to  go  into  special  needs  school  and  the
             [respondent] was working closely with the school  as  well  as
             with professionals to ensure that the  child  gets  back  into
             mainstream education.  As rightly pointed out by Mr Alim  when
             one considers the impact the [respondent] has had on the lives
             of the children with him being in the country it  is  true  to
             say that a negative effect would follow if he was out  of  the
             country.  The mother's children has (sic) played  very  little
             part and next to nothing in  the  part  of  [ML]'s  upbringing
             although she is currently the carer of [TL].  Having said that
             she herself has not made any attempt to reverse the  residence
             order in regard  to  [ML].   Furthermore  she  recognises  the
             impact that the [respondent] plays in  the  part  of  her  two
             children as can be seen in a letter she has  written  on  28th
             November, 2013 in which she acknowledges that the [respondent]
             took on his responsibility of being a dad very  serious  (sic)
             doing most of the night feeds, bathing,  changing  of  nappies
             for their first son [ML].  She had social workers in her  life
             for personal reasons and she was put in a mother and baby unit
             when she failed and so the [respondent]  became  the  one  who
             passed  the  assessment.   Again  she  acknowledges  that  the
             [respondent] played a part with looking after [TL].  [TL]  was
             about 4 years old  when  the  relationship  broke  down.   She
             acknowledges that despite she and the [respondent]  not  being
             in a relationship that the [respondent] is a  responsible  dad
             and takes the roles very serious (sic).  She also acknowledges
             that [TL]'s behaviour became so bad with the  absence  of  his
             dad that he had to be dragged to school stating  that  he  was
             going to kill himself and also he had behavioural problems and
             became erratic.  Since the release of  the  [respondent]  from
             prison [SB] acknowledged that  [TL]  is  gradually  improving.
             The evidence given by [SB] in a witness statement corroborates
             that of [CS] who identifies the role George has played in  the
             children's lives.  Mrs Campbell who  is  George's  mother  has
             also played a very supportive role when George was  in  prison
             but is becoming elderly and he has health problems and in  any
             case can never fulfil the role George is fulfilling.  The  two
             children are growing to become teenagers and are  still  at  a
             stage of their lives where the impact of their father  who  in
             the case of [ML]'s role is more crucial as the [respondent] is
             more or less playing the role of father and mother and in  the
             case of [TL]'s role is ensuring that he is making  a  positive
             change.

         65.  We have taken into account the submissions  made  by  Ms  Khan
             with regard to the public revulsion of the kind of  crime  the
             [respondent] has committed and the fact that  the  deportation
             of the [respondent] would create a deterrence to other foreign
             criminals.  However from them following suit however  we  have
             found  exceptional  circumstances  in  the   impact   of   the
             [respondent] in the light of his two children the fact that he
             is the main carer and has a residence order in respect of  his
             first son [ML].  With the absence  of  the  [respondent]  from
             this country we have no doubt that  these  children  would  be
             worse off and would rebel and go down the  way  of  committing
             offences.   It  is  quite  evident  that  the  impact  of  the
             [respondent] in [TL]'s life is  such  that  once  he  went  to
             prison he became aggressive and ended up in  a  special  needs
             school.  [ML] also became withdrawn and the damage  limitation
             was done only because his grandmother was looking  after  him.
             His grandfather is aged and at his age [ML] needs  the  proper
             care of a father.  We also weigh in the balance the fact  that
             there is a letter from the National Probation Service  stating
             that the [respondent] fully adhered to the National  Standards
             Reporting  Instructions  and  kept  all   of   his   probation
             appointments.  He engaged proactively during all sessions  and
             is determined to  address  his  issues  around  his  offending
             behaviour.  It is noted that he maintains a good  relationship
             with his extend family and most importantly is the  concluding
             remarks of the supervising probation officer which notes  that
             the [respondent] response to supervision is excellent  and  he
             is genuinely motivated to address his underlying  issues  from
             the past.  He is described as polite, patient  and  respectful
             and above all his current risk of harm  and  re-offending  has
             been reduced as low and he is no longer at risk for the  wider
             society.  We find that  weighing  the  factor  of  the  public
             interest on one side of the scale and the factors on the other
             side  of  the  scale  the  impact  of  the  absence   of   the
             [respondent]  on  his  two  children,  the   fact   that   the
             [respondent] is no longer a risk to  the  wider  society,  the
             fact that he had a good character before getting  involved  in
             the offence he was involved and found himself in a  vulnerable
             position by using his own identity card  points  to  the  fact
             that the [respondent] is not one who readily commits  criminal
             offences.  Whilst we do not undermine the seriousness  of  the
             offence he committed the fact remains that this is  a  one-off
             offence and there  is  no  indication  that  the  [respondent]
             intends to commit such offence or any other criminality in the
             future.  We therefore find based on the evidence given by  the
             [respondent], [CS],  the  appellant's  mother  and  all  other
             supporting evidence with regard to his impact on the lives  of
             his two children as well as  the  personal  character  of  the
             [respondent] himself which  has  been  totally  reformed  that
             there  are  exceptional  circumstances  in  this  case   which
             outweigh the public interest.  We therefore find, applying the
             Immigration  Rules  which  is  a  complete   code   that   the
             exceptional circumstances referred to under paragraph  398  of
             the Immigration Rules is such that it exists  in  the  present
             case."

19.  The panel appear not to have  reminded  themselves  what  was  said  at
    paragraph 24 of LC (China) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2014] EWCA Civ, namely

         "... it follows that neither the fact that the appellant's children
         enjoy British nationality nor the fact that they may  be  separated
         from their father for a long time will be sufficient to  constitute
         exceptional circumstances of  a  kind  which  outweigh  the  public
         interest in his deportation.  The appellant's children will not  be
         forced to leave the UK since, if she chooses to do so, their mother
         is free to remain with them in this country."

    Neither had the Tribunal appeared to have reminded themselves  of  what
    was said at paragraph 27 of Lee v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2014] EWCA Civ 348:

         "The tragic consequence is that this family, short lived as it  has
         been, will be broken up for ever because of  this  appellant's  bad
         behaviour.  That is what deportation does ..."

20.  I believe that the Tribunal also erred at paragraphs 66 and 67  of  the
    determination.  At paragraph 66 they noted that they were  required  to
    take account of Section 117C(6) of  the  Immigration  Act  2014.   This
    requires that in the case of a foreign criminal who has been  sentenced
    to a period of  imprisonment  for  at  least  four  years,  the  public
    interest  requires  deportation  unless  there  are   very   compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

21.  The Tribunal were concerned at paragraph 56  of  the  determination  to
    point out that the change in the law which  changed  the  threshold  to
    "very compelling circumstances" did not apply  to  this  appeal.   They
    went  on,  therefore,  throughout  their  determination   to   consider
    exceptional circumstances and at no  time  did  they  consider  whether
    there were any very compelling circumstances.  However,  almost  as  an
    aside, the Tribunal said at paragraph 67 that they find  no  difference
    in their analysis in the application of the proportionality test  under
    the Immigration Rules and under the Immigration Act 2014.  The  problem
    with that finding is that nowhere do they remind themselves that  "very
    compelling circumstances" is a very much higher test than  "exceptional
    circumstances".  What they say at paragraph 67 is simply wrong.

22.  The judge's sentencing remarks are set  out  in  paragraph  28  of  the
    claimant's decision that Section 32(5)  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007
    applies taken on 10th September, 2013.  The judge said:-

         "It is a tragedy to see you before the court to be sentenced today.
          You are 29, a family man of hitherto  good  character.   You  were
         convicted following a trial of your part in the importation of just
         under 600 grams of pure heroin with a street value of  easily  over
         �100,000.

         Having heard the evidence  I  am  quite  satisfied  that  your  co-
         defendant Mr Khan was the prime mover in this offence liaising with
         others abroad to arrange the importation  of  drugs,  you  are  his
         friend there is evidence of telephone traffic between him and those
         shipping the drugs and between him and you in the  run  up  to  the
         delivery.  It is also clear that you were a channel  through  which
         �1,500  to  purchase  the  drugs   was   paid   to   Pakistan,   an
         unsophisticated attempt because you used your own driving  licence,
         when he was arrested you were in contact with  others  involved  in
         the conspiracy before in due course you were arrested.

         By their verdict the jury rejected your explanations that  you  did
         not know that this was a drug deal,  nevertheless  I  am  satisfied
         that your role was significantly  less  than  Mr  Khan.   You  were
         involved.  You assisted in the transfer of funds  but  beyond  that
         there is no evidence of any greater criminality on your part.

         In coming to the  sentence  that  I  do,  I  therefore  adopt  this
         approach, I bear in mind that this is an offence of importation  of
         heroin, it is approaching 600 grams.  The case  of  Arama  suggests
         that the starting point should be a sentence of  somewhere  in  the
         region of ten years or more.

         In dealing with you I have to have regard to the fact that there is
         a possibility albeit a slim one that in due course I will  conclude
         that Mr Khan thought that he  was  involved  in  cannabis  and  not
         heroin.  Justice required me to give you the benefit of that doubt.
          That issue has not been resolved because Mr Khan  has  voluntarily
         absented himself, that  is  no  fault  of  yours.   Accordingly,  I
         proceed to sentence  you  on  the  basis  that  although  you  were
         involved  in  the  importation  of  heroin  you  thought  you  were
         importing cannabis.  That fact that you paid only  �1,500  for  the
         drugs is evidence which would  support  that  view.   To  adopt  an
         analogy you were in this episode a lieutenant and not a general and
         I accept the submission that you came into this enterprise  towards
         the end ..."

23.  Controlled drugs, be they heroin, cocaine or cannabis  are  responsible
    for causing misery to countless lives, the break up of families and  on
    occasions premature death.  It is the curse of modern society and those
    who seek to import controlled drugs for the  purpose  of  supplying  to
    others do so purely for greed.  It is an evil business.

24.  I accept that if the respondent is deported it may very well  mean  the
    end of the family life that he enjoys with [ML] and [TL] and the family
    life that they enjoy with him.  The impact on them will be very  great.
    I do not under estimate  it.   I  also  bear  in  mind  that  were  the
    respondent to be deported he will not  be  permitted  to  re-enter  the
    United Kingdom for at least ten years and in view of his conviction may
    never be permitted to re-enter the United Kingdom.  The effect  of  the
    respondent's removal will, therefore, be to end  family  life  that  he
    enjoys with his sons and which they enjoy with him although it will  of
    course be possible for them, should they choose, to visit him.  I  bear
    in mind what the Court of Appeal said in both LC (China)  and  Lee.   I
    find that there are no very compelling  circumstances  over  and  above
    those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A which  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation in this appeal.

25.  The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.  I set aside the previous  decision.   My  decision  is
    that the appeal of the respondent be dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
