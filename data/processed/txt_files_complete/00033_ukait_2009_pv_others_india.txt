The "historical wrong" righted  by  the  insertion  of  section  4B  of  the
British Nationality Act 1981 does not entitle a beneficiary of that  section
or members of his family to raise Article 8 arguments on a basis that  would
not succeed in other cases.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.  This is the reconsideration of an appeal (more precisely, five  appeals)
against the refusal on 31st January 2007 of entry  clearance  for  the  five
appellants to join their sponsor, Mr Bhanji Karsan Varsani,  in  the  United
Kingdom for settlement.  The first  appellant,  Premila,  is  the  sponsor's
wife, and the other four are their children.  The  oldest,  Sushilaben,  was
born in December 1985, and was  just  over  21  at  the  date  of  decision.
Manishkumar was born in September 1988, and so had just turned 18  when  his
application for entry clearance was submitted in December 2006.   Meena  was
born in November 1990 and Bharat was  born  in  August  1992,  and  so  were
minors at the dates of application and decision.  They all live together  in
the family house at Mankuva, a village in the state of Gujarat, the  nearest
town to which is Bhuj.  They were all born in, and are citizens of, India.

2.  Premila and the two minor children were refused entry clearance  on  the
basis that there would not be adequate  maintenance  and  accommodation  for
them, while the two older children were  refused  on  the  additional  basis
that  they  would  not  be  "living  alone  in  the  most   compelling   and
compassionate  circumstances"  (misquoting  paragraph   317(i)(f)   of   the
Immigration Rules, which  refers  to  'the  most  exceptional  compassionate
circumstances').  Surprisingly for  a  settlement  case,  the  AIT-2  appeal
forms indicated that an oral hearing was not requested,  while  the  grounds
of appeal were exiguous and  formulaic.   Despite  this  unpromising  start,
when the appeals came before Immigration Judge Gillance  in  September  2007
for determination 'on the papers', he allowed them all.   He  was  satisfied
that there would be adequate maintenance  and  accommodation  for  all  five
appellants, and that in Sushila's case, she  would,  as  a  young  unmarried
Hindu  woman,  be  "living  alone  in  the  most  exceptional  compassionate
circumstances."   In  Manish's  case  the  judge  did  not  think  that  the
requirements of rule 317(i)(f)  could  be  met,  but  he  allowed  all  five
appeals additionally  on  human  rights  grounds,  principally  because  the
sponsor had been  a  British  Overseas  citizen  and  in  NH  (female  BOCs,
exceptionality, Art 8, para 317) India [2006] UKAIT 85  Hodge  J  had  shown
that even the overage children of former  British  Overseas  citizens  might
have a good claim to be admitted under Article 8 because of the  "historical
wrong" of their mothers' exclusion in the past.

3.  A review was sought on behalf of the respondent, it being  alleged  that
the judge had erred  in  supposing  either  that  the  appellants  could  be
adequately maintained on the sponsor's income, or that  their  circumstances
engaged Article 8 of the European Convention.  Reconsideration  was  ordered
by Senior Immigration Judge Waumsley in October 2007, but  when  the  'first
stage' of the reconsideration came before SIJ McKee in  April  2008  it  was
decided to adjourn the case in the hope of convening a panel chaired by  the
President.  Mr Gill wished  to  argue  that  the  principles  which  he  had
advanced in NH, and which had been adopted by Mr Justice  Hodge  in  respect
of female 'BOCs' who had been unable to apply for  Special  Quota  Vouchers,
could be extended to BOCs more generally and could facilitate the  admission
of their dependants on Article 8 grounds.  The case came  before  SIJ  McKee
again in August 2008, when it was confirmed that Hodge  J  was  prepared  to
chair a Presidential panel with a view to 'reporting' the outcome.   Shortly
afterwards, however, the President fell gravely ill,  and  in  the  end  the
best course seemed to be for the matter to  come  before  SIJ  McKee  and  a
colleague, who would decide whether there had indeed been a  material  error
of law in Immigration Judge Gillance's  determinations,  and  who  would  if
necessary undertake a 'second stage' reconsideration of the appeals.

4.  Copious documentary evidence has been adduced for this  reconsideration,
and we have had the benefit of very skilful advocacy and arguments  on  both
sides.  The case  is  a  complex  one,  requiring  an  appreciation  of  how
Britain's colonial past continues to impinge upon the present, and  how  the
retreat from Empire created different  classes  of  British  national,  some
without a right to reside in the mother country.  But we  shall  deal  first
with the respondent's challenge  to  Immigration  Judge  Gillance's  finding
that there was adequate maintenance available to the appellants at the  date
of decision.  (In AS (Somalia)  [2009]  UKHL  32  the  House  of  Lords  has
confirmed that section 85(5)  of  the  2002  Act  does  compel  the  AIT  to
consider only the circumstances obtaining at the  date  of  decision  in  an
entry clearance case, even when human rights are in  issue.)   As  we  shall
see, the question of maintenance  is  not  straightforward  in  the  present
case.

5.  If  the  sponsor's  wife  and  two  younger  children  could  have  been
adequately maintained at the date of decision, then  their  appeals  succeed
under paragraphs 281 and 297 of HC 395  respectively.   The  respondent  has
not challenged IJ Gillance's finding that Sushila would be living  alone  in
the most exceptional compassionate circumstances, so if she too  could  have
been adequately maintained, then her appeal would  succeed  under  paragraph
317.  On the other hand, there has been no challenge to the judge's  finding
that Manish would not be living alone in the most exceptional  compassionate
circumstances, so his  appeal  -  even  if  adequate  maintenance  had  been
available - could not succeed under the Rules, and he would have to rely  on
Article 8.  Of course, the judge did allow his appeal under  Article  8,  as
he did with the other four appellants too.  But if those four succeed  under
the Rules, there will be no need in their case to  examine  the  "historical
wrong" done to British Overseas citizens,  which  has  loomed  large  in  Mr
Gill's submissions, and which prompted IJ  Gillance  to  allow  the  appeals
under Article 8.

6.  An unusual feature of this case  is  that  the  sponsor  was  unable  to
satisfy the British authorities that  he  was  a  British  Overseas  citizen
until he came here as  a  visitor  and,  in  June  2006,  obtained  a  'BOC'
passport. He then set about  registering  as  a  full  British  citizen  and
making arrangements for his dependants to join him.  Thus  it  was  that  he
signed a 'Sponsorship Statement' on 25th August 2006, in which he said  that
he was living rent-free with his sister at an address  in  London  NW4,  but
had arranged for his family to live in a five-roomed house  in  Harrow  when
they arrived.  He was earning about �200 a week as a mason, and  had  �4,000
in the Halifax Bank.  This letter was before IJ Gillance, as  was  a  letter
dated 5th September 2006 from a  building  contractor,  Ashcon  Ltd,  saying
that the sponsor had been taken on as a mason/handyman on 27th August  at  a
wage of �200 per week.  This was also the weekly income given  in  the  Visa
Application Forms.  On the other hand, during her interview  at  the  Deputy
High Commission on 31st  January  2007,  Premila  had  given  her  husband's
income as �1,500 per month, rather than the �200 per week which appeared  on
her Visa Application Form, and the judge examined the sponsor's accounts  to
see whether, as at 31st January  2007,  the  figure  quoted  by  Premila  at
interview was accurate.

7.  An Appellant's Bundle  had  been  provided  for  the  appeal,  including
lengthy written submissions by an advocate in Bhuj.   In  the  bundle  there
are accounts prepared for the sponsor by L.P. Patel & Co., which  show  that
during the period 25th September 2006 to 5th April 2007 the sponsor, who  is
described therein as a self-employed general builder, earned a gross  income
of �7,752 (�5,997 net).  Until 5th January 2007  he  had  been  working  for
Ashcon Limited, and from 14th February 2007 he worked for Vish  Construction
Ltd, and there are photocopies in the bundle of Tax Payment Vouchers  issued
by both firms.  His gross  earnings  with  Ashcon  were  �2,800,  with  �504
deducted in tax, while his gross earnings with Vish were �2,193,  with  �395
deducted in tax.  For most of the period between  25th  September  2006  and
5th April 2007 the sponsor was working for either Ashcon or  Vish,  grossing
about �5,000.  But for a short period between 6th January and 13th  February
he is  said  to  have  earned  �2,759  doing  General  Building  Maintenance
(Residential).  No tax was paid on this sum, and there is  no  evidence  for
it in the accounts, unlike the documents from Ashcon and Vish.   Where  this
work was done, why the sponsor was paid so much for it, and why he  reverted
to much lower paid work, are  not  explained.   Yet  the  judge  found  that
"[t]his supports the assertion by the First Appellant that  he  was  earning
at the date of decision around �1,500 per month."

8.  We are very doubtful that the  sponsor  enjoyed  a  five-week  period  ~
coincidentally, just around the date of decision ~ when he earned over  �550
a week free of tax, when for the  rest  of  the  accounting  period  he  was
grossing little more than �200 a week, and paying tax on that.  IJ  Gillance
calculates, from the total income set down by L.P. Patel  &  Co.,  that  the
sponsor's average weekly income, even including  the  high  earnings  during
the five-week 'blip', came to  no  more  than  �277  gross,  and  �214  net.
Having made that calculation, the judge simply concludes,  "I  am  satisfied
the sponsor was in a position to maintain the  appellants  without  recourse
to public funds."

9.  That conclusion is, in our view, clearly erroneous in  law.   The  judge
has not factored in any outgoings.  In particular, he has not  deducted  the
�800 a month which the sponsor would have to pay in rent  for  the  proposed
accommodation, or the �120 per month which, we were  told  at  the  hearing,
would have to go on Council Tax.  Even without those deductions,  the  judge
has calculated that  the  sponsor's  average  income  during  the  six-month
period, in the middle of which comes the date of  decision,  was  only  �214
per week,  and  yet  he  is  satisfied  without  more  that  this  would  be
sufficient for the sponsor to maintain a wife and four children.   Deducting
the rent and Council Tax would, of course, leave nothing at all.

10.  We shall have to  take  a  fresh  decision  on  maintenance  ourselves.
There is a difficult problem in doing that, since the  respondent's  grounds
for seeking a review repeat without demur the judge's finding that  "at  the
date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision, the sponsor received  a  net
monthly income of �1,500."  This is the figure which Mr Patel  has  used  as
the base line for his calculation that, despite  the  deduction  of  �920  a
month, there would still be adequate maintenance for the  appellants.   Miss
Kiss has  urged  us  not  to  use  this  inappropriate  figure  in  our  own
assessment, but Mr Gill and Mr Patel insist upon the adversarial  nature  of
these proceedings and contend that the respondent must  be  fixed  with  the
�1,500 figure which he himself  has  accepted  in  challenging  the  judge's
determination.

11.  At first we favoured the latter contention, but on reflection we  think
that would be wrong.  Even if it is accepted that the  sponsor  was  earning
that high figure at the date of decision, it was clearly  a  most  untypical
'blip'.  The average figure, apart from those five weeks around the date  of
decision, was less than  �200  a  week  net  (even  factoring  in  the  high
earnings for five  weeks,  the  weekly  average  is  �214  net).   That  the
sponsor's earnings have continued at the lower rate can  be  seen  from  his
Witness Statement dated 25th March 2008, when he says  that  he  is  earning
�240 a week with K & K Builders.  To form a realistic view  of  a  sponsor's
ability to maintain his dependants,  one  may  well  have  to  look  at  his
earnings over a longer period than just the date of decision and a  week  or
two on either side.  What if the sponsor, in the period from 6th January  to
13th February 2007, had been out of work instead of doing  general  building
maintenance?  It would not be fair to dismiss his  appeal  because,  at  the
date of decision, he was not working, and to ignore the  evidence  that  for
months before and after the date of decision, he was working.  Just  so,  it
would be artificial  to  take  a  uniquely  high  figure  as  the  base  for
calculating the sponsor's ability to maintain his dependants,  ignoring  the
evidence that his income was at all other times a great deal less.

12.  The task of  this  panel  is  to  determine  whether,  looking  at  the
sponsor's circumstances as a whole at the  time  when  the  decisions  under
appeal were taken, he would  have  been  able  to  maintain  his  dependants
adequately, for a period longer  than  the  two  weeks  after  the  date  of
decision (following which the sponsor began working  for  Vish  Construction
Ltd at a much lower wage).  Post-decision evidence can be used in  an  entry
clearance case if it sheds light on the circumstances 'appertaining' at  the
time of the decision, and it would not make sense to exclude  such  evidence
if it assists us in making a realistic assessment of the  sponsor's  ability
at the date of decision to provide adequate maintenance.

13.  It does make sense to take the  accounting  period  of  25th  September
2006 to 5th April 2007 as a whole, and to use the average net weekly  income
of �214 as our base line.  If we take the  sponsor's  monthly  income  as  a
rather generous �900 a month, that cuts a swathe through  the  very  careful
and thorough calculations which Mr Patel presented to  us  at  the  hearing,
based as they were on a base of �1,500 a month.  Mr Patel's trump  card  was
the addition to the sponsor's earnings as a builder of Child Tax Credit  and
Working Tax Credit which, although included among the 'public funds'  listed
at paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules, are not  counted  as  impermissible
recourse to public funds under paragraph 6B.  Miss Kiss reminded us  that  a
new paragraph 6C, inserted on 31st March 2009, does  count  the  receipt  of
tax credits as recourse to public funds if  an  application  is  being  made
from outside the United Kingdom, and she asked us to  infer  that  this  was
always implicit in the meaning of  paragraph  6B.   We  cannot  accept  that
invitation.  There is nothing in the wording  of  paragraph  6B  to  suggest
that it only applies to people who are already in the United  Kingdom.   The
insertion of paragraph 6C was done, we apprehend, not to shed light on  what
paragraph 6B had always meant, but to prevent a  large  class  of  applicant
from continuing to take advantage of paragraph 6B.  Thus,  at  the  date  of
decision in the instant case, tax credits could be included  as  (potential)
income for the sponsor.

14.  Mr Patel's initial calculations were designed to  show  that  at  least
the sponsor, his wife and the two minor children could easily be  maintained
on the sponsor's earnings  plus  those  benefits  which  did  not  count  as
recourse to public funds.  He also endeavoured to show  that  Sushila  could
be squeezed in as well, although he acknowledged that it would be  difficult
get Manish  in  without  calling  upon  other  sources  of  money.   To  the
sponsor's monthly income of �1,500 Mr  Patel  added  Child  Benefit  (which,
although a 'public fund', the Home Office  has  long  disregarded)  and  Tax
Credits to yield a total monthly income of �2,115, from which he  subtracted
�800 rent to leave �1,315 disposable income  for  Mr  and  Mrs  Varsani  and
their two minor children.  It was later realized  that  Council  Tax  should
also be deducted, leaving �1,195.  But if  we  take  the  sponsor's  monthly
earnings as �900 rather than �1,500, the disposable income shrinks to �595.

15.  In KA & ors (adequacy of maintenance)  Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT  65,  Mr
Ockelton confirmed that what a comparable family  would  receive  on  Income
Support should be the benchmark of 'adequacy' under the  Immigration  Rules,
and Mr Patel did indeed provide a table showing that, during the year  2006-
2007, a couple with two minor children on Income  Support  would  have  been
entitled to allowances and premiums totalling �855 per month.  That is  some
�260 a month more than the sum available to the sponsor, his  wife  and  the
two minor children after deduction of  housing  costs.   The  sponsor  would
have enough for himself and his wife alone, but  presumably  she  would  not
wish to leave the children behind.

16.  Is there any way, looking at the time of the decision,  in  which  more
income  could  have  been  generated?   Several  ways  have  in  fact   been
suggested, and we shall look  at  these  now.   First,  because  the  entire
family is vegetarian, and none of its members smoke or  drink,  it  is  said
that they can subsist comfortably on less money  than  the  average  British
family, indeed on less than what they would get  on  Income  Support.   That
argument has been roundly rejected in cases like KA  (Pakistan),  Uvovo  and
Momotaz Begum, and we see no reason to depart from the stance taken  by  the
Deputy President.  There must be an objective benchmark of adequacy, and  it
will not do for appellants to argue that they can live  on  less  than  what
the Government considers to be subsistence level for British residents.

17.  Secondly, while none of the children said  in  their  Visa  Application
Forms that they would be taking employment,  the  sponsor's  wife  indicated
that she did intend to work in the  UK,  although  when  asked  to  be  more
specific, she replied "NOT  DECIDED".   She  is  illiterate  and  speaks  no
English, but the sponsor insists that his wife will be able to find work  as
a cleaner  when  the  family  move  into  their  proposed  accommodation  in
Wembley.  Inability to speak  English  will  not  be  a  barrier,  he  says,
because there are many Gujerati speakers in  the  area.   We  can  certainly
take notice of the fact that there  is  a  large  Asian  population  in  the
vicinity of Harrow and Wembley, but we do not think that, on its  own,  this
makes it more likely than not that Premila Varsani will find work  within  a
short time.  Nothing has been put forward by way of a job offer,  and  while
job offers are often, it is true, treated  with  some  scepticism,  we  have
nothing more to go on than a vague assumption that  cleaning  work  will  be
available.

18.  There is now an offer of 'third party support'.  In a  statement  dated
8th April 2008, the sponsor's brother-in-law, Valji Kanji Patel,  with  whom
the sponsor has been living in Hendon, confirms that he and  his  wife  will
support the appellants financially once they are here, if  the  need  should
arise.  Apart from the problem that third party support may  not  have  been
in contemplation at the date of decision, the Immigration  Rules  have  been
interpreted in AM (Ethiopia) [2008] EWCA 1082  as  prohibiting  reliance  on
such support.  We understand that AM has gone up to the House of Lords  (or,
shortly, the Supreme Court), but we are currently  bound  by  it.   Mr  Gill
points out that third party  support  was  specifically  allowed  under  the
Special Voucher Scheme for the maintenance  of  voucher  holders  and  their
dependants, but while that may be relevant to the Article 8  aspect  of  the
appeal, it cannot affect the application of paragraphs 281, 297 and  317  of
the current Immigration Rules.

19.  The sponsor says that the five-roomed house which he has available  for
his family in Wembley is big enough to sub-let one of the rooms.  But we  do
not know whether the owner of the property, Laxmi  Devji  Hirani,  would  be
willing to allow this.  Indeed, we do  not  know  whether  the  property  is
still available.  On 29th August 2006 Mrs Hirani wrote that  she  wished  to
let 6, St James Garden "to Bhanji for about a year at a  rent  of  �800  per
calendar month."   One  of  the  problems  with  focusing  on  the  date  of
decision, as one must do in entry clearance  cases,  is  that  circumstances
may well have changed in the meantime.  It seems unlikely  that  Mrs  Hirani
would keep her property empty year after  year,  if  she  could  find  other
tenants for it.  But that does not affect  the  present  appeals.   What  is
relevant is that, at the date of decision, there was no hint  that  part  of
the accommodation into which the  family  would  move  after  their  arrival
would then be sublet to a paying tenant.   The  sponsor's  other  gambit  is
that the family could actually live in smaller, cheaper accommodation.   But
that was not in contemplation at the date of decision either.

20.  Then there are the sponsor's savings.  He opened a Halifax  account  in
August 2006, and on 26th August it held a balance of �4,100.   At  the  date
of decision it stood at �3,200, and over the next few months  it  fluctuated
between �3,000 and �4,000.  We do not  think  that  savings  at  that  level
would have been enough to bring the family past the  threshold  of  adequacy
at that  time,  although  we  acknowledge  that  by  2008  the  sponsor  had
accumulated a great deal more in his Halifax account.  The air  fares  alone
would have made a large dent in �3,000 or �4,000.

21.  Perhaps the sponsor's strongest argument is that  the  family  home  in
Mankuva is, according to a valuation carried out by a registered  valuer  in
June 2008, worth some 9 lacs rupees, which is more  than  �10,000.   If  all
the family were to move here, the house could be sold, or  rented  out.   We
think it is a fair assumption that, if all the appellants  had  been  issued
with entry clearance in January 2007, the sponsor would have wanted to  sell
or rent out the family home, even if this was not something  which  was  put
to the Entry Clearance Officer.  The trouble is, while we know how much  the
house was worth a year later, we do not know how much demand there  was  for
residential property in Mankuva in the early part of 2007, and how  easy  it
would have been to find a buyer  or,  failing  that,  someone  to  rent  it.
Perhaps the property market was booming in Cutch at that time, but  we  just
do not know.  The house was not on the market at the date of  decision,  and
we do not know how long it would have taken  for  a  sale  to  be  completed
after the occupants had moved to this country, where the sponsor  would  not
have had enough money to maintain them adequately prior to the  proceeds  of
sale coming into his hands.

22.  It may  seem  harsh  that  we  have  run  through  a  list  of  various
alternative sources of finance  for  the  appellants,  and  found  them  all
wanting.  The basic difficulty for the sponsor is that, while  he  continues
to live rent-free with his  sister  and  brother-in-law,  he  can  build  up
savings and send remittances home, even when he is only earning �214 a  week
(rising to �240 last year).  To maintain and accommodate  a  wife  and  four
children in their teens and twenties is  quite  a  different  story.   These
appeals went askew at the outset when the immigration judge failed  to  make
a proper assessment of the sponsor's ability  to  maintain  the  appellants,
while the respondent's grounds for seeking a review added to  the  confusion
by fixing on a wholly unrealistic  impression  of  the  sponsor's  available
income.  We are not unsympathetic to the dilemma in which the sponsor  finds
himself, having come to this  country  in  fulfilment  of  a  long-cherished
ambition, only to find that he cannot bring his wife and  children  to  join
him.  But we can only allow these appeals under the  Rules  if  there  would
have been adequate maintenance  for  the  appellants  at  the  time  of  the
decision.  By our reckoning, the sponsor could have maintained  himself  and
his wife adequately, but not the children.

23.  We turn now to Mr Gill's alternative argument that, even if the  strict
requirements of the maintenance rules, as currently  understood,  cannot  be
met by all the appellants, the historical wrong  done  to  British  Overseas
citizens and their families has affected this sponsor and  these  appellants
so badly that it would be wholly disproportionate now to  keep  them  apart,
and indeed there is no legitimate public end  to  be  served  by  doing  so.
Immigration Judge Gillance allowed the appeals under Article 8, and  we  are
invited to find that he  made  no  error  of  law  in  that  aspect  of  his
determination.  One of the  respondent's  criticisms  is  that  he  did  not
explain why the two adult children could be said to enjoy family  life  with
the sponsor in terms of Article 8, but we can say at once  that  Manish  and
Sushila have remained in the same household as their mother and two  younger
siblings, and have remained financially and  emotionally  dependent  on  the
family unit headed by the sponsor.  At the date of decision, Manish  was  no
older than the appellant in  NH  (India),  who  was  found  to  come  within
Article 8.  In the words of Lady Justice Arden in Kugathas [2003]  EWCA  Civ
31, "something more exists than  normal  emotional  ties"  between  the  two
overage children and the sponsor.

24.  The other main criticism is that the judge found the sponsor to be  "in
the same situation as the two female sponsors in the case of  NH",  when  in
fact their circumstances were very different.  True it is that  the  leading
cases in this area - NH (India) [2007] EWCA  Civ  1330,  RO  (India)  [2008]
EWCA Civ 1525 and JB (India) [2009]  EWCA  Civ  234  -  have  all  concerned
British Overseas citizens who were married women and who, because  of  their
marital status, were unable to apply for the Special  Quota  Vouchers  which
would have enabled them to come to the United Kingdom  with  their  families
at a time when their children had not become overage.   As  a  man  and  the
head of a household, the sponsor here did not labour under this  disability,
and it has to be said that nowhere in his determination does the judge  show
any appreciation of the different problems which  this  sponsor  faced.   He
does not seem to be aware of the sponsor's history, saying for example  that
the sponsor "was registered as a British citizen on  5  September  2006  and
thereafter came here and obtained work and applied for his  family  to  join
him."  In fact, the sponsor  was  already  here  when  he  registered  as  a
British citizen.  To say that "in principle" the  sponsor  is  in  the  same
situation as female  sponsors  who  were  'BOCs'  is,  in  our  view,  self-
evidently not so, although Mr Gill would contend that all BOCs were  victims
of an historical wrong.  We think it  necessary,  however,  to  examine  the
circumstances of the BOC sponsor in any particular appeal, to see how  being
a BOC might affect the Article 8 assessment.  It will not do to  assume,  as
the judge did here, that the children of any BOC sponsor must per se have  a
strong case under Article 8.

25.  Accordingly, we find an error of law in the Article  8  aspect  of  the
determination, and we must proceed to take a fresh decision  ourselves.   To
do this, we must recite the sponsor's family history, which is contained  in
a long Witness Statement and supplemented  by  many  photocopied  documents.
There is no reason to doubt that this history is largely accurate,  although
at some points Mr Gill and we draw different inferences from it.   Mr  Gill,
who has established himself as the leading advocate in this 'niche' area  of
immigration law, made lengthy and  persuasive  submissions  to  us,  and  we
trust he will forgive us if we do not attempt to summarize them.

26.  We begin in 1908, when the sponsor's father was born in the village  of
Mankuva.  He was a subject of  the  Maharajah  of  Cutch,  and  was  thus  a
British Protected Person.   Like  many  impoverished  Gujarati  men  in  the
1930s, he went to seek work in British East Africa, and for  many  years  he
divided his time between Kenya and Cutch.  In 1940 the sponsor's father  and
mother were  married  in  Mankuva,  at  a  time  when  the  registration  of
marriages was unknown in that part of  the  world.   Several  children  were
born to the couple, but they all, like  their  mother,  stayed  in  Mankuva.
Their father never brought any of his family to Kenya.

27.  In 1953 the sponsor's father registered in Nairobi as a Citizen of  the
United  Kingdom  and  Colonies  ('CUKC'),  and  any  children  born  to  him
thereafter were CUKCs by descent.  Although  India,  certainly  since  1955,
has not permitted dual nationality, the sponsor's father does  not  seem  to
have had any problem travelling between India  and  Kenya  until  1971.   In
August of that year he approached the British High Commission in Nairobi  to
renew his CUKC passport, and it was endorsed with  the  observation  "HOLDER
IS SUBJECT TO CONTROL UNDER THE  COMMONWEALTH  IMMIGRANTS  ACT."   That,  of
course, was the notorious 1968 Act who deprived  non-patrial  CUKCs  of  the
right to come and live in the United Kingdom.  Those  advising  the  sponsor
have taken this endorsement to mean that the sponsor's  father  had  applied
to migrate to the UK, and was told he could not, because of  the  1968  Act.
But this view is contradicted by an endorsement on  the  next  page  of  the
passport, dated 27th August 1971 : "THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT  THE  HOLDER  OF
THIS PASSPORT IS A CITIZEN  OF  THE  UNITED  KINGDOM  AND  COLONIES  WHO  IS
ENTITLED TO AN ENTRY CERTIFICATE TO TRAVEL TO  THE  UNITED  KINGDOM  AND  HE
WILL BE ISSUED WITH SUCH AN ENTRY CERTIFICATE ON APPLICATION TO THE  NEAREST
BRITISH GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE."  Far from being told that he  could  not
migrate to the 'mother country', the sponsor's  father  was  told  he  could
travel any time.  Why did he not avail himself of the opportunity?   Perhaps
he could not afford the fare.  At any rate, he decided instead to return  to
India, and on 30th August 1971 his British passport was stamped with a  visa
at the Indian High Commission in Nairobi, valid  for  a  single  journey  to
India, and for a stay  of  six  months.   The  sponsor's  father  was  given
permission to land at Bombay on 24th September 1971, and  for  the  rest  of
his life (he died in 1973) he stayed (indeed, it would seem, overstayed)  in
his native village of Mankuva.

28.  The sponsor himself was born in Mankuva in 1964.  During the 1970s  his
mother made some attempts to get the British consular authorities in  Bombay
to recognize her  children  as  British,  but  she  could  not  produce  any
marriage certificate as proof of their legitimate birth to  a  CUKC  father.
Affidavits from two witnesses to the marriage might,  it  seems,  have  done
the trick, but she could only find one (and he has  since  died).   In  1981
the sponsor, who was still 17, asked the Deputy High  Commission  in  Bombay
for a British passport, and the application was passed to the  Home  Office,
but was rebuffed because of a lack of documentary evidence.   For  the  next
twenty years the sponsor got on with  his  life  in  Mankuva,  marrying  and
having children, but in 2002 and 2003  he  renewed  his  application  for  a
passport.  A statutory declaration  could  have  been  substituted  for  his
parents' non-existent marriage certificate, but the  Consular  Section  also
demanded "first class documentary evidence" dating from the sponsor's  early
years, which again the sponsor could not produce.  In 2004  an  advocate  in
Bhuj (who was also involved in  preparing  the  sponsor's  appeal  in  2007)
advised him to travel to the UK and try there  to  establish  his  claim  to
British nationality.  So the sponsor applied for a visa to visit  his  niece
in the UK.  This was refused, but the sponsor was successful on appeal,  and
in April 2006 he arrived on these shores.

29.  Events then moved quickly.   In  May  the  sponsor  found  two  elderly
Gujeratis in West Ham who agreed to make statutory  declarations  that  they
had been present at his parents' wedding.  Armed  with  these  declarations,
the sponsor obtained a British Overseas citizen's passport in June,  and  by
September he had registered as a full British citizen under  section  4B  of
the 1981 Act.  We have no doubt that the primary purpose  of  the  sponsor's
visit was not to see his niece but to  obtain  recognition  of  his  British
nationality.  We can hardly  hold  that  against  him,  as  he  was  getting
nowhere with his applications in India.  The question we must ask  ourselves
now is, given this history, does Article 8  require  that  the  sponsor  and
appellants  live  together  in  this  country,  even  if   the   maintenance
requirements of the Rules have not been satisfied?   The  question  is  made
all the more difficult because, in the leading cases  on  BOCs,  maintenance
has always been adequate.

30.  We do not think it is relevant that  the  sponsor's  father  apparently
could have, but did not, act upon his entitlement to  an  entry  certificate
in 1971.  The sponsor was only 7 years old at the time, and as  soon  as  he
approached manhood, he applied for a  British  passport.   If  he  had  been
recognized as a CUKC by the consular  authorities  in  Bombay  in  1982,  he
could have applied for a Special Quota Voucher and, although it  might  have
taken some years for him to reach the end of the queue, he  would  no  doubt
have been able to come here at a time when any children he  had  would  have
been very young.  He was rebuffed again in 2002 and  2003,  although  if  he
had been able to establish his British nationality at that  time,  he  would
have been able to register as a full British citizen after the end of  April
2003.  The trouble was, neither his parents' marriage nor his own birth  had
been  registered,  and  the  British  civil  servants  insisted  on   seeing
documentary evidence, despite the fact that  registration  was  not  carried
out, commonly or at all, in that part of India at those times.   Unlike  the
female BOCs who were unable to apply for Quota Vouchers  because  they  were
married women, the sponsor would have been eligible to apply from  his  18th
birthday, if only he had been accepted as a CUKC (or, later, a BOC).

31.  On the  other  hand,  it  was  not  unreasonable  of  the  Deputy  High
Commission to require more than an applicant's bare assertion  that  he  was
the son of a British father.  Can the sponsor  be  blamed  for  not  getting
better evidence?  He had little trouble finding  two  people  in  London  in
2006 who remembered attending his parents' wedding in 1940.  One might  have
expected that, in 1982 and thereafter, he could have  found  two  people  in
Mankuva with equally good memories.  It should also be borne  in  mind  that
the  sponsor's  family  did  not  migrate  to  East  Africa,  only  to  find
themselves facing expulsion after the  British  colonies  and  protectorates
were granted independence.  The  sponsor's  father  was  a  migrant  worker,
earning money as a mason in Nairobi, but  always  returning  to  his  native
village, where his wife and growing family  continued  to  live.   Thus  the
East African connexion, and the pressure to leave East  Africa,  can  hardly
be said to feature strongly in this case, compared to  that  of  many  other
BOCs.

32.  What seemed at first blush to  be  the  sponsor's  strongest  point  is
this.  He travelled here  on  an  Indian  passport,  which  the  Nationality
Directorate of the Home Office thought had been issued in error.   It  seems
more likely to us that the sponsor, never  having  been  able  to  establish
that he was British, would have been regarded by the Indian  authorities  as
nothing other than an Indian national.  But  by  registering  as  a  British
citizen in September 2006, the sponsor ceased to be a citizen  of  India  by
virtue of section 9 of that country's Citizenship Act 1955.  We do not  know
whether the sponsor would now be  able  to  resume  permanent  residence  in
India, and it is said on his behalf that he has  'burnt  his  bridges'.   Of
course, one can be permanently resident in Britain without being  a  British
citizen, and while  we  cannot  draw  inferences  from  that  about  similar
arrangements in India, the fact that the sponsor was born  in  India,  lived
there all his life until 2006, and has a wife and  children  there  who  are
Indian citizens, makes it seem rather unlikely that he would not be  allowed
back.  We note also that it is now possible for citizens of other  countries
to apply for Overseas Citizenship of India, a new status designed to  secure
links between the large Indian diaspora and the home country.   On  balance,
therefore, we do think it likely that the sponsor would be  able  to  resume
family life in India.

33.  The question  then  comes  down  to  this.   Do  the  sponsor's  failed
attempts - in 1982, 2002 and 2003  -  to  establish  his  claim  to  British
nationality, when all along he was entitled to a CUKC or BOC  passport  and,
at least until 5th March 2002, he could have applied  for  a  Special  Quota
Voucher, mean that it would now be a disproportionate interference with  his
family life if, through inability to satisfy  the  maintenance  requirements
of the Immigration Rules, he cannot bring his  dependants  to  join  him  in
this country?  It must be remembered that, under paragraph  252(ii)  of  the
Immigration Rules, it  was  a  requirement  that  adequate  maintenance  and
accommodation be provided for  the  families  of  Special  Voucher  holders.
Admittedly, that could be provided through third party support,  but  it  is
unclear that any such support would have been available to  the  sponsor  if
he had travelled to the UK before the Special Voucher Scheme was abolished.

34.  In the particular circumstances of this family, we  have  come  to  the
view that Article 8 cannot  override  the  maintenance  requirement  of  the
Rules.  The sponsor and appellants enjoyed family  life  together  in  India
until April 2006, and since the latter part of 2006  the  sponsor  has  been
trying to re-establish that family life in this country.  Mr  Gill  contends
that, because of the wrongful refusal of the  British  authorities  to  give
him the opportunity of coming here much sooner, and because of the  iniquity
of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 and the Quota Voucher  Scheme  which
was  intended   to   ameliorate   it   somewhat,   it   would   clearly   be
disproportionate to any legitimate public end now to deny  this  family  the
right to live here together.  But we think it  important  to  weigh  in  the
balance the fact that the sponsor is now a British  citizen,  and  that  all
British citizens  must  have  adequate  maintenance  for  their  non-British
dependants.  The  sponsor's  inability  to  prove  his  British  nationality
sooner has not, we think, caused him and his family such prejudice, or  been
so conspicuously unfair, as to  compel  their  admission  in  spite  of  the
maintenance requirement of the Immigration Rules.  They have apparently  had
a comfortable  life  in  Mankuva.   Their  house  there,  according  to  the
valuer's  report,  is  in  a  middle-class  area,   and   has   all   modern
conveniences.  It would not be unreasonable to  expect  family  life  to  be
resumed in India.  We do not think that the sponsor  should,  in  principle,
be treated more  favourably  because  of  his  history  than  other  British
citizens who, through poverty, cannot bring family members to join  them  in
this country.  The maintenance requirement of the Rules  is  indifferent  to
race or history, and there is a strong public interest in  imposing  such  a
requirement.

35.  In coming to this eventual conclusion, we realize that  it  will  be  a
great disappointment not only to this family but  to  their  solicitors  and
counsel, who have striven  with  great  diligence  to  achieve  the  desired
result, and it is through no want of skill and hard work on their part  that
this result has not yet been achieved.


DECISION

The appeal of Premila Varsani is allowed under the Immigration  Rules.   The
other appeals are dismissed  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  all  five
appeals are dismissed on human rights grounds.
