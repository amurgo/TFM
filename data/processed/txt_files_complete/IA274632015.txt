For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Qasim Khan, was born on 4 August  1989  and  is  a  male
    citizen  of  Pakistan.   He  appealed  against  the  decision  of   the
    respondent dated 23 July 2015 to refuse him  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as the spouse of Yasmeen Khan (hereafter Mrs  Khan)  who
    is present and settled in the United Kingdom.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge  Bashir)  in  the  decision  promulgated  on  23  February  2016
    dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now appeals, with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant married Mrs Khan in April 2011 in Pakistan.   He  arrived
    in the United  Kingdom  on  10  November  2012  having  obtained  entry
    clearance as a spouse which remained valid until 29 January  2015.   He
    made an application for further leave to  remain  as  a  spouse  on  26
    January 2015.  The appellant and  Mrs  Khan  claimed  to  be  employed.
    However, the application was refused by the respondent  who  considered
    that the appellant had failed to satisfy the provisions of HC  395  (as
    amended) as regards income and maintenance.

 3. Dismissing the appeal under HC 395, Judge Bashir wrote:

         "I have heard the evidence in relation to [Mrs Khan's]  employment.
         Although the joint income with his spouse would exceed �18,600  per
         annum (�150 x 52 = �7,800 + �1,043 x 12 - �12, 516 net) at the date
         of application the income was only �150 per week.  The  information
         regarding [Mrs  Khan's]  employment  was  not  submitted  with  the
         application as she was not in employment at the relevant period.

         Furthermore the appellant has not complied with the requirements of
         Appendix FM-SE in particular 1(n).  The appellant is paid  in  cash
         and has not produced any bank statements to show  the  net  amount.
         Although there are cash deposits into the Barclays account which is
         in joint names, they do not equate  to  �600  per  calendar  month.
         Neither is there a letter from the appellant's employer  confirming
         his employment as per paragraph 2(b)  of  Appendix  FM-SE.   It  is
         acceptable that the appellant was not able to obtain a letter  from
         BMS Autos however the current employer is his brother  therefore  I
         find he should  have  not  had  difficulties  obtaining  the  same.
         Accordingly, the appellant has not satisfied  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM-SE.   For  these  reasons  the  appellant's  employment
         cannot be taken into account.  Accordingly, the appeal fails  under
         paragraph 284(viii) as appropriate evidence of adequate maintenance
         has not been provided."

 4. There are two grounds of appeal.  First, it is asserted that the  judge
    had not "made clear findings" with regards the joint income which it is
    asserted exceeded �18,600 per annum.  In essence, the appellant submits
    that, given that income, it did not matter that he had failed to comply
    with the requirements of Appendix FM-SE given that, with regard to  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds, no evidence was shown  that  the  economic
    wellbeing of the United Kingdom would be damaged as  a  result  of  the
    appellant's continued residence in this country.

 5. I do not find that the grounds  have  merit.   The  strict  documentary
    evidence requirements of HC 395 were not created  solely  in  order  to
    frustrate and exclude by way of only a technicality applicant  such  as
    this  appellant.   Judge  Bashir  quite  correctly   notes   [19]   the
    documentary requirements seek to impose a standard for the evidence of,
    in this case, claimed income.  Judge Bashir was not wrong in  law  when
    she stated that "appropriate evidence of adequate maintenance  has  not
    been provided" because the appellant had failed to comply with Appendix
    FM-SE.  That finding carried over to the  consideration  of  Article  8
    ECHR.  It would make no sense that the judge  would  find  evidence  of
    income inadequate for the provisions of the Immigration Rules and  then
    simply admit such evidence and  allow  an  appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds.  The First-tier Tribunal is now well  aware  of  the  need  to
    consider Article 8 in the light of the provisions  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (see most recently, AJ (Zimbabwe) EWCA Civ 1012).  The  appellant
    in the present case is simply urging  the  judge  to  assess  the  same
    evidence by reference to two different grounds of  appeal  and  to  use
    Article 8 as a general dispensing power where the appellant has  simply
    failed to produce satisfactory evidence of his income.

 6. The second ground of appeal complains that the judge,  having  accepted
    that the appellant's family and private life was as described by him in
    his  evidence  and  would  suffer  "consequences  of  such  gravity  as
    potentially to engage the operation of Article 8" if the appellant were
    removed as a result of the  immigration  decision.   The  grounds  then
    complain that the judge "confines  [herself]  to  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules without a meaningful onward consideration of  Article
    8 outwith the Rules when the facts disclose are 'reasonably arguable'".
     This takes me back to what I have said above  regarding  the  need  to
    consider Article 8 through the lens of the Rules  and  the  requirement
    which exists even in those parts of the Rules do not form  a  "complete
    code" as regards the proper application of Article 8.   In  any  event,
    the criticism is completely unfounded.  I have found that the judge has
    not erred at  [31-32]  where  she  has  recorded  the  failure  of  the
    appellant to meet the "detailed requirements of the  Rules".   However,
    the judge goes on at [33]  to  consider  Section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  ("the  best  interests  of  the
    children") and, crucially, where the  family  life  may  reasonably  be
    enjoyed by this couple and their child  in  Pakistan.   The  judge  was
    aware that the child is "a very young ... baby".  The judge found  that
    "family life can be enjoyed in Pakistan, the appellant  has  lived  for
    the majority of his life there, his wife  has  visited  and  they  were
    married in Pakistan.  Their baby daughter is too  young  to  understand
    the difference in life between the two countries".  That I consider  to
    be an entirely reasonable finding arising from the evidence  which  was
    before the Tribunal.  It was not fair, therefore, for the appellant  to
    argue that the judge has failed to carry out an  adequate  analysis  of
    the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  For the  reasons  I  have  given
    above, I find that she has done so.
