                                   Between

                              MR Muhammad Majid
                       (anonymity directions not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY Of STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms E Daykin of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr Tufn, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant a citizen of Pakistan  appealed  against  the  respondent's
   decision refusing him leave to remain indefinitely as a dependent of  his
   mother present and settled in the United Kingdom  pursuant  to  paragraph
   317 of the Immigration Rules. In a determination by Judge  MR  Oliver  of
   the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant's appeal was dismissed.


2. The appellant applied for  permission  to  appeal  which  was  stated  as
   "granted" by Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein on 24 November 2014.


3. It is clear from reading the reasons that permission was not granted  but
   was refused.


4. The word "granted" at the beginning  of  the  decision  should  therefore
   read "refused". It is clearly a typographical error. There was  no  issue
   that that is the correct position because  at  the  hearing  it  was  not
   argued otherwise. Therefore  there  is  no  valid  appeal  before  me  to
   determine.




   Decision


   Appeal dismissed
