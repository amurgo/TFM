For the Appellant: Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr E Nicholson, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal  brought  by  the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
    determination of a First-tier Tribunal Judge promulgated  on  4  August
    2014 where Ms Cekuri's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision
    of 24 February 2014 was allowed.  That decision was to refuse Ms Cekuri
    leave to remain and to remove her to Albania.  The appeal was dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules but allowed on Article 8 grounds.

2.   The relevant background facts can be  summarised  shortly  as  follows.
    Ms Cekuri was born on 4  January  1980  and  is  a  female  citizen  of
    Albania.  As at July 2014 she was 34 and she had two sons aged 9 and 7.
     She had made an application for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    with her husband, Mr Edmond Poci, a British citizen.  Mr Poci has  been
    in this country since November 2003 and  settled  here  in  the  United
    Kingdom in 2010 on the basis of marriage to an EEA  national  in  2000.
    That relationship appears to have broken down, ultimately resulting  in
    divorce in January 2012.

3.   Ms Cekuri claimed that she had been in  a  relationship  with  Mr  Poci
    since 1998 and that they had two sons together, one in 2004 and one  in
    2006, both born in Albania.  They had all been  living  together  as  a
    family since she and her sons came to the United  Kingdom  on  19  July
    2012 illegally in the back of a lorry.  Mr Poci is a self-employed taxi
    driver since 2009 earning just over �11,000 a year out of which he pays
    rent on the property.  Together they have had a third  son,  a  British
    citizen born in this country in January of this year, that  is  to  say
    January 2014.

4.   Ms Cekuri's application was initially submitted in  October  2012.   It
    was refused on 2 April 2013.  As at October 2012 she could not meet the
    requirements of Appendix FM or  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Following Protocol correspondence the Secretary of State agreed
    to reconsider that decision but  she  maintained  it,  issuing  another
    refusal in February 2014.  As we have noted, within that period a third
    child was born.  That meant that the appellant's ability to satisfy the
    requirements of Appendix FM for leave to remain as his parent fell  for
    consideration.  But because the appellant was not the  sole  carer  she
    could not meet those requirements either, nor could she therefore  take
    advantage of EX.1, which is not a  freestanding  provision,  see  Sabir
    [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC).

5.   The initial decision which as we have described was  upheld  on  review
    was taken on the basis that the Secretary of State was  satisfied  that
    the appellant and her dependants could not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM in relation to their family life or paragraph 276ADE of the
    Immigration Rules in relation to their private life, and there were  no
    compassionate or compelling circumstances meriting  a  grant  of  leave
    under Article 8.

6.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge  gave  a  lengthy  and  detailed  ruling.
    Both the appellant and her husband Mr Poci gave evidence and the  judge
    recorded that evidence in considerable detail.   Having  set  out  that
    evidence, she went on to conclude at paragraphs 22 and  following  that
    the appellant did not meet the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  or  the
    Immigration Rules.  Therefore at paragraph 23  the  judge  went  on  to
    apply the rule under Gulshan as it stood then,  namely  having  applied
    the requirements of the Rules  only  if  there  may  be  arguably  good
    grounds for granting leave to remain outside them is it  necessary  for
    Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether  there  are  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.   The  judge  was
    satisfied that the existence of the third British son was  an  arguably
    good ground to lead to a consideration of whether  or  not  there  were
    compelling circumstances.

7.   The judge then went on at paragraph 24 to  consider  the  Secretary  of
    State's own guidance to her own caseworkers in respect of assessing the
    child's best interests and whether it  was  reasonable  to  expect  the
    child to leave the UK.  The judge also took into account  the  case  of
    Azimi-Moayed [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC) noting the Tribunal's comments there
    amongst other things that as a starting point it is in a  child's  best
    interests to be with both of their parents.  They have  both  stability
    and continuity of social and educational provision and the  benefit  of
    growing up in the cultural norms of the society to which they belong.

8.   The judge went on to refer  to  Guidance,  setting  out  the  following
    paragraph:

         "Where a decision to refuse the application would require a  parent
         or primary carer to return to a country outside  the  EU  the  case
         must always be assessed on the basis that it would be  unreasonable
         to expect a British citizen child to leave the EU with that  parent
         or primary carer.  In such cases it will usually be appropriate  to
         grant leave to the parent or primary carer to enable them to remain
         in the UK with the  child,  provided  that  there  is  satisfactory
         evidence of a genuine and subsisting parental relationship."

9.   The judge  then  considered  this  guidance  and  those  principles  by
    reference to the facts of Ms Cekuri's case.  The judge said that whilst
    her immigration history was not the best and  there  had  been  illegal
    entry she was satisfied that the behaviour  could  not  be  classed  as
    repeatedly breaching the Immigration Law because although she had  come
    here in July 2012 by October 2012 she had taken steps to regularise her
    position.  At paragraph 27 the judge went on to say this:

         "I am conscious of the fact that if the third son were to stay here
         in the care of his father and his mother and brothers  returned  to
         Albania his father would not be able to work full-time as  he  does
         at the moment earning just over �19,000 per annum from his job as a
         ground worker and taxi driver and thus would not be able to support
         the appellant and their eldest two sons in Albania as  much  as  he
         did in the past.  This inability to work full-time would last until
         the youngest child went to nursery or school and  even  then  could
         continue unless he was fortunate enough to obtain employment  which
         paid sufficient for him  to  pay  for  full-time  childcare.   This
         inability to work full-time would then impact upon his  ability  to
         sponsor his wife and sons' return to  the  UK  through  the  proper
         channels which would in turn mean that apart from visits to Albania
         the youngest child would be separated from his mother and  siblings
         until such time as he went to school  or  nursery  and  his  father
         could then work  and  earn  sufficient  to  bring  his  mother  and
         siblings over to the UK to live permanently."


10.  In all the circumstances, the  judge  went  on  to  say  that  she  was
    satisfied that the decision to refuse leave  to  remain  to  Ms  Cekuri
    would have unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  her  youngest  son,
    either by separating him from her or by making him leave the country of
    his birth and losing all the attendant benefits he is entitled to as  a
    British  citizen.   She  was  satisfied  that  these  were   compelling
    circumstances and, following Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27,  that  made  the
    decision disproportionate for Article 8 purposes.

11.  The judge accepted in terms that this would be seen  as  the  appellant
    in effect obtaining leave to remain in the  UK  by  the  back  door  by
    virtue of her youngest son's British citizenship but the  Secretary  of
    State's own guidance made it clear that the starting point was that  it
    should be considered unreasonable for a British citizen child  to  have
    to leave the EU with his non-EEA national parent or primary carer.

12.  On this appeal the Secretary of State raises a single ground  of  error
    of law.  Firstly it is said  that  the  judge  noted  the  guidance  in
    Gulshan.  Then, having found Ms Cekuri's third son being born in the UK
    and a British citizen, that could not amount to arguably  good  grounds
    to consider whether there were compelling  circumstances  because  that
    was a matter specifically recognised in the Rules, namely  EX.1.(a)  of
    Appendix FM.  In those circumstances there was an error of law.

13.  In her oral submissions Ms Isherwood for the  Secretary  of  State  has
    gone on to expand by saying effectively that there  was  an  inadequate
    exercise on the facts on the question in particular of whether  or  not
    sufficiently compelling circumstances existed.

14.  For Ms Cekuri Mr Nicholson says firstly there was no material error  of
    law.  The judge's reference to the Secretary of  State's  own  guidance
    was entirely legitimate.  She was right to have regard to that guidance
    and to consider that the sufficient  compelling  circumstances  existed
    not least by reference to the Upper Tribunal in  Sabir.   Even  if  all
    that were wrong and in some way the Immigration Rules and  Appendix  FM
    provided a complete code, the guidance on EX.1.(a)  was  predicated  on
    the Zambrano case which was reflected itself in the guidance  to  which
    the judge referred.

15.  We remind ourselves that the right of appeal arises only on a point  of
    law, see Section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007.
    The central ground of appeal on which permission was granted as we have
    recorded relied upon the authority of Gulshan.  The Rule in relation to
    Gulshan has of course, however, been clarified recently.  We  refer  in
    particular to R (Oludoyi) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2014] UKUT 00539 (IAC) considering R (MM & Ors) v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 2712  (Admin).   Those  authorities
    confirm that consideration of whether or not there are arguable grounds
    for granting leave to  remain  outside  the  Rules  is  an  unnecessary
    intermediate step.  There is no threshold test.  Rather there is a need
    to look at the evidence  to  see  if  there  is  anything  not  already
    adequately considered in the context of  the  Immigration  Rules  which
    could lead to a successful Article 8 claim.

16.  Therefore, in our judgment, to the extent that  the  appeal  relies  on
    Gulshan being a threshold test and as requiring the judge to ignore any
    matters explicitly recognised in the Immigration Rules without more  it
    fails.  The  judge  was  in  our  judgment  entitled  to  carry  out  a
    proportionality assessment.  It is right that she  placed  considerable
    weight on the Secretary of State's guidance but that guidance  does  no
    more than reflect the public interest.  It is also consistent with  the
    Zambrano principle previously referred to.

17.  Having considered the case of Razgar, the central issue  is  the  final
    question of proportionality.

18.  In relation to the judge's  decision  as  to  the  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences of the decision to refuse leave  we  cannot  identify  any
    material error of law.  The judge reached a judgment which was open  to
    her on the facts and a decision which cannot  be said to be perverse or
    irrational.  We remind ourselves of the high threshold that  a  finding
    of perversity would require.

19.  We are also reminded  of  the  remarks  of  Lord  Justice  Carnwath  in
    Mukarkar v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006]  EWCA  Civ
    1045 at paragraph 40.

               "Factual judgments of this kind are often not easy but  they
               are  not  made  easier  or  better  by  excessive  legal  or
               linguistic analysis.  It is of the nature of such  judgments
               that   different   Tribunals,    without    illegality    or
               irrationality, may reach different conclusions on  the  same
               case.  The mere fact that one Tribunal has reached what  may
               seem an unusually generous view of the facts of a particular
               case does not mean that it has made an error of law so as to
               justify an appeal under the  old  system  or  an  order  for
               reconsideration  under  the  new  nor  does  it  create  any
               precedent so as to limit the Secretary of State's  right  to
               argue for a more restrictive approach on a similar  case  in
               the future.  However, on the facts of  the  particular  case
               the  decision  of  the   specialist   Tribunal   should   be
               respected."

20.  Equally here, in our judgment, the decision of the specialist  Tribunal
    should be respected in circumstances  where  we  have  been  unable  to
    identify any material error of law.

21.  We do not conclude our judgment without recording the  fact  that,  for
    the Secretary of State,  reliance  was  sought  to  be  placed  on  the
    relevant provisions of the Immigration  Act  2014.   Ms  Isherwood  was
    unable to state whether or not this legislation was in  fact  effective
    at the time that the decision was taken but we deal  with  it  for  the
    sake of completeness.  Section 117B of the Act provides at subparagraph
    (6) as follows:

         "In the case of a person who  is  not  liable  to  deportation  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -


         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a qualifying child, and




         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom."

22.  For our part and albeit obiter, we cannot see that application of  this
    provision would result in a different outcome.  Indeed, if anything, it
    is a provision  which  tends  to  favour  Ms  Cekuri  rather  than  the
    Secretary of State on the merits of the case.

23.  For all these reasons we dismiss the appeal.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge did not make an anonymity direction, we have not been asked to do
    so and in the absence of any explanation as to what good reasons  there
    might be we do not make such a direction.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
