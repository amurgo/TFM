For the appellants:         Mr R Molyneux, of Global Immigration Solutions,
London
For the respondent:    Mr M Diwyncz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants appealed to the FtT against refusal of  residence  cards
    under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006  as  the  extended  family
    members of the brother of the first appellant, and against  refusal  of
    leave on human rights  grounds.   FtT  Judge  Kempton  dismissed  their
    appeals by a decision promulgated on 23 January 2017.

 2. The appellants applied to the FtT for permission to appeal to  the  UT,
    advancing two grounds:

         (1)      the judge erred in  understanding  and  applying  the  law
         relating to permanent residence of family members of EEA nationals,
         and failed properly  to  consider  Home  Office  guidance,  as  she
         applied an outdated version; and

         (2)      based on the regulations, guidance,  and  discretion,  the
         appeal should have been allowed on human rights grounds.

 3. On 10 August 2017 FtT Judge Hodgkinson took the  view  that  the  judge
    arguably  erred  by  relying  on  the  incorrect  guidance,  and  said,
    "Permission is granted only in relation to the long residence  /  human
    rights element of the appeals, bearing in mind that there is  no  right
    of appeal in relation to the EEA decisions".

 4. The appellants applied to the UT  for  permission  to  appeal  also  on
    ground (1), pointing out that the case law was not as Judge  Hodgkinson
    thought.

 5. On 5 September 2017 UT Judge Jackson granted permission on ground  (1),
    as the appellants were correct about jurisdiction, and on the view that
    consideration of an out of date version of the guidance was arguably an
    error of law capable of affecting the outcome.

 6. The appellants  instructed  their  present  representatives  after  the
    hearing in the FtT.  It is not clear whether either party  in  the  FtT
    referred Judge Kempton to the outdated guidance quoted at  �16  of  her
    decision.

 7. The passage of the current guidance on which Mr  Molyneux  relied  says
    that applicants do not have to depend on the EEA national  for  all  or
    most of their essential needs.  He also emphasised that dependency does
    not have to be of necessity  but  may  be  of  choice.   He  said  that
    dependency could exist even although the appellants had employment  and
    income  from  which  they  might  have  supported  themselves   without
    assistance, had they not chosen to take out a substantial loan to buy a
    3-bedroom house.  The evidence  before  the  FtT  was  that  the  first
    appellant earned about �17-18,000 and the second  appellant  �16,000  a
    year.  Mr Molyneux said this, as a matter of fact, was  not  enough  to
    meet their essential needs, and so dependency was established.

 8. Mr Molyneux realistically accepted that the case could not  succeed  on
    human rights grounds.

 9. Having heard also from Mr Diwyncz, we reserved our decision.

10. As put in the guidance, the appellants had to  show  that  they  needed
    financial support from the sponsor to  meet  at  least  some  of  their
    essential needs.

11. Appellants who have plainly sufficient  income  to  support  themselves
    cannot establish dependency by taking on unnecessary commitments beyond
    their income.  Those are not essential needs.

12. The income  the  appellants  said  they  earned  was  ample  for  their
    essential needs.

13. The oral and documentary evidence for  the  appellants  was  vague  and
    incomplete.  Income, outgoings, and transfers  from  the  sponsor  were
    poorly vouched.

14. The first appellant was a witness of little if any credit, claiming  in
    his statement to have no  one  left  in  Nigeria  but  saying  in  oral
    evidence that his mother, his siblings and all his wife's family  lived
    there.

15. The first appellant's oral evidence was that the second appellant sends
    most of her money  to  assist  her  siblings  in  Nigeria  (�18).   The
    sponsor's evidence suggested that the first appellant  makes  transfers
    to their mother (�23).  These matters are inconsistent with  dependency
    of the appellants on the sponsor.

16. There is no error in  the  judge's  conclusions  at  �25  that  genuine
    dependency had not been proved, and that any payments from the  sponsor
    were made "without much question, rather than  on  account  of  genuine
    need".

17. The submissions to us  did  not  clarify  the  period  over  which  the
    appellants would have to prove dependency.   We  need  not  attempt  to
    resolve that, as the evidence did not show any dependency.

18. Reference to an earlier version of guidance,  however  that  arose,  is
    immaterial. The outcome was equally inevitable in terms of the  updated
    guidance.

19. The decision of the FtT, dismissing the appeals, shall stand.

20. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
