    Representation:


                            For the Appellants: Mr M Khan a solicitor
           from Bukhari Chambers Solicitors
          For the Respondent: Ms A Everett a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are citizens of India who were born on 1 February  1961
      and 7 April 1971 respectively. They are husband and wife  and  I  will
      refer to them in this way and together as the  appellants.  They  have
      been given  permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Holder ("the FTTJ") who dismissed their appeals against
      the respondent's decisions of 9 June 2011  to  refuse  them  leave  to
      remain in the UK  on  human  rights  grounds.  The  FTTJ  heard  three
      appeals; those of the husband and wife and  the  other  of  their  son
      Anush Choudhary. I will refer to him as the son. The FTTJ allowed  the
      appeal of the son on Article 8 human rights  grounds.  The  respondent
      has not appealed against that decision.


   2. The husband came to the UK on 23 April 2004 and was granted  leave  to
      remain as a visitor until 5 July 2004. The wife and the  son  came  to
      the UK on 22 May 2004. They were granted leave to remain  as  visitors
      until 5 July 2004. All of them remained here without any leave after 5
      July 2004. They applied for leave to remain  outside  the  Immigration
      Rules on 10 May 2011 leading to the respondent's decisions of  9  June
      2011.


   3. The three of them appealed and the  FTTJ  heard  their  appeal  on  18
      February 2013. Both sides were legally represented, the appellants and
      the son by Mr Khan who appears before me. The FTTJ heard evidence from
      the appellants, the son and a friend of the family.  The  respondent's
      position was set out in a refusal letter dated 4  October  2014.  This
      was that the appellants and the son did not meet the  requirements  of
      paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules in relation to private  life
      or Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules in relation to family life. To
      return them to India would not be a disproportionate interference with
      their right to respect for their private and family  lives  so  as  to
      breach their Article 8 rights.


   4. In the determination the FTTJ made findings of fact in relation to the
      appellants and the son.  He  concluded  that  none  of  them  met  the
      relevant private life  requirements  under  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
      Immigration Rules. None of them met the family life requirements under
      Appendix FM or EX1 of the  Immigration  Rules.  Their  appeals  failed
      under the Article 8  human  rights  requirements  in  the  Immigration
      Rules.


   5. The FTTJ went on to  consider  the  Article  8  human  rights  of  the
      appellants and the son outside the Immigration  Rules.  The  five-step
      tests in Razgar v SS HD (2004) UKHL 27 were  followed.  The  questions
      posed in the first four of the tests were answered in the  affirmative
      in relation to both private and family lives. The  appeals  turned  on
      proportionality. The FTTJ found that there would be a disproportionate
      interference with the son's private life if he was returned to  India.
      There would not be a disproportionate  interference  with  his  family
      life if the husband and wife were returned but he was not.


   6. The FTTJ found that there would not be a disproportionate interference
      with the right to respect for their family and private  lives  if  the
      husband and wife were returned to India.


   7. The appellants applied for and were granted permission to appeal by  a
      judge in the First-Tier Tribunal. The  grounds  argue  that  the  FTTJ
      erred in law. It is  submitted  that  the  decision  is  unjustifiably
      harsh. The factors  which  it  is  argued  should  have  led  to  this
      conclusion are set out. The FTTJ erred in his reasoning leading to the
      conclusion that the appellants still had ties to India  and  that  the
      husband had the ability to run a business there. It was  an  error  to
      find that the interference with their Article 8 rights was in  pursuit
      of a potentially legitimate and lawful aim, namely  the  interests  of
      effective  immigration  control.  The  conclusion  that  it  was   the
      appellants' responsibility to ensure that  they  remained  in  the  UK
      legally failed to take into account the evidence that  they  had  been
      ill-advised by their previous legal adviser. The FTTJ  had  failed  to
      take into account the bond between the  appellants  and  the  son  and
      their mutual dependence on their  grandchildren.  Insufficient  regard
      had been paid to their old age. There had been no proper assessment of
      proportionality in line with the relevant authorities  or  the  effect
      which their removal would have on the private and  family  life  which
      they had established in the UK.


   8. There is a Rule 24 response from the  respondent  which  submits  that
      there is no error of law and that  the  FTTJ  gave  appropriate  self-
      directions.


   9. Mr Khan relied on the  grounds  of  appeal.  The  appellants  had  two
      children, the son and another son (Kartik)  both  of  whom  live  with
      them. Kartik had two sons. His leave to remain in this country is  due
      to expire in July 2014. He is separated from his partner and his  sons
      do not live with him. The appeal decision, if implemented, would split
      the family. The son wished to complete  his  education  in  mechanical
      engineering. The wife was born two days after  her  father  died.  The
      family considered this highly unlucky and as  a  result  she  was  not
      brought  up  by  her  own  mother  and   her   family   regarded   her
      "differently". The husband and the son had only worked in this country
      because they needed to do so in order to survive.


  10. In reply to my question, Mr Khan said  that  the  FTTJ  had  not  been
      provided with a valuation of the  family  home  in  this  country.  He
      argued that if the husband and wife were removed the  sons  would  not
      have the means to visit them in India. I was asked to  find  that  the
      FTTJ erred in law, set aside the  decision  and  re-determine  it.  He
      asked for the opportunity to present further evidence although he  was
      not able to tell me what this would be or why it  had  not  been  done
      before, as required by standard Directions.


  11. Ms Everett asked me to find that there was no error of law.  The  FTTJ
      properly considered the relevant principles  of  law.  The  FTTJ  gave
      clear reasons for the conclusion why the son  did  not  have  ties  to
      India that the husband and wife did.  They  lived  in  India  both  as
      children and as adults. The FTTJ reached conclusions open  to  him  on
      the evidence as to the husband and wife having ties in India. The fact
      that the family would be split up if the son decided to remain in this
      country was properly addressed. It was open to the FTTJ  to  say  that
      there was no dependency creating a family  life  going  beyond  normal
      emotional  ties  between  adults.  I   was   asked   to   uphold   the
      determination.


  12. In his reply Mr Khan submitted that the family were closely  dependent
      on each other. These were more than normal emotional ties. The husband
      and wife had no contact with their families in India and it  would  be
      very harsh to split the family. Their grandchildren would be taken out
      of their lives.


  13. I reserved my determination.


  14. Much of what is said in the grounds of appeal  relies  on  submissions
      that might have some force if the FTTJ  had  or  should  have  reached
      findings of fact entirely or substantially in line with  the  evidence
      given mainly by the appellants but also by the  son.  The  submissions
      pay little or no heed to the findings actually made  by  the  FTTJ.  I
      find that in a clear and carefully  reasoned  determination  the  FTTJ
      made findings of fact which were open to him on all the  evidence.  It
      was open to him to come to the conclusion that  the  appellants  still
      had ties in India for the reasons he gave in paragraph  38  (iv).  The
      FTTJ did not say that the husband could restart his  old  business  in
      India but that he had shown the ability to run a business in India. It
      would be surprising if the husband's property in Maidenhead  Berkshire
      was still worth something in the region of the ï¿½160,000 which he  paid
      for it in 2006, the more so in the absence  of  any  reason  why  this
      should be the case or any independent evidence as to value.  The  FTTJ
      recognised that they appellants had established ties  and  connections
      in the UK since they had been here but they had spent the greater part
      of their childhood and adult  lives  in  India.  The  submissions  pay
      little regard to the fact that apart from a  short  period  when  they
      first arrived the appellants have never had any leave to remain  here.
      It was open to the FTTJ to find that the husband kept abreast  of  the
      situation in India on the basis of  his  evidence  that  he  sometimes
      watched Indian news on television.


  15. I can  find  no  fault  with  the  conclusion  that  the  respondent's
      decisions and the interference with the appellants' private and family
      lives are in accordance with the law,  in  pursuit  of  a  potentially
      legitimate  and  lawful  aim  namely  the   interests   of   effective
      immigration control  (paragraph  32  and  33).  The  grounds  did  not
      disclose why this might be so.


  16. The FTTJ accepted the evidence that  the  appellants  had  taken  some
      steps to regularise their stay  in  the  UK  by  instructing  a  legal
      adviser who failed properly to deal with their cases but, having  done
      so, it was still open to him to come to the  conclusion  that  "it  is
      their responsibility to ensure that they and their family remained  in
      the United Kingdom legally" and  "the  fact  is  that  they  knowingly
      remained in the United Kingdom illegally".


  17. I find that FTTJ gave proper consideration to  the  bond  between  the
      appellants and both their sons and their grandchildren as appears from
      paragraph 38 (v) and (vi). I do not consider that it would  have  been
      appropriate for the FTTJ to find the appellants to be  in  "their  old
      age" as is suggested in the grounds.


  18. I find that the FTTJ gave detailed  in  proper  consideration  to  the
      appellants' private and family lives on Article 8 human rights grounds
      outside the Immigration Rules.


  19. The FTTJ did not make an anonymity direction. I have not been asked to
      make one and I can see no good reason to do so.


  20. The grounds of appeal are, in essence, no more than disagreement  with
      conclusions properly reached by the FTTJ. I  find  that  there  is  no
      error of law and I uphold the determination.
