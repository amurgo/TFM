Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Atuegbe (Legal Representative)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant, born September 5, 1982  is  a  citizen  of  Nigeria.  On
    September 30, 2013 he submitted an application  for  limited  leave  to
    remain as the father of a British child and the partner  of  a  British
    citizen. The respondent refused his application under  the  Immigration
    Rules on April 10, 2013 under Appendix FM and in particular sections R-
    LTRP or R-LTRPT.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on April 23,  2014.
    On August 18, 2014 Judge of the First Tier Tribunal Foudy  (hereinafter
    referred to as the "FtTJ") heard his appeal.  She  allowed  the  appeal
    under Section EX.1 of Appendix FM based on the  relationship  with  the
    child.

 4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on September  3,  2014  and  on
    October 6, 2014 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Vaudin  d'Imecourt
    granted permission to appeal finding it  arguable  the  FtTJ  may  have
    erred  in  light  of  the  decision  of  Sabir  (appendix  FM-EX1   not
    freestanding) [2014] UKUT 00063 (IAC).

 5. Mr McVeety accepted there was no merit to the grounds  of  appeal.  The
    FtTJ correctly applied EX.1 in this appeal because  the  appellant  was
    not caught by the provisions of Section E-LTRP.2.1 because  he  was  an
    overstayer and not a visitor. He was therefore not  excluded  from  the
    provisions and could rely  on  Section  EX.1.  There  had,  rightly  or
    wrongly, been no challenge to the FtTJ's findings at paragraphs [14] to
    [15] of her determination and  he  did  not  seek  to  persuade  me  to
    consider any additional grounds of appeal.

    DECISION


 6. There was no material error of law I uphold the original decision.


 7. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.

Signed:     Dated: December 15, 2014

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Alis



TO THE RESPONDENT

There was no application for a fee award and I uphold the original fee
award decision.
