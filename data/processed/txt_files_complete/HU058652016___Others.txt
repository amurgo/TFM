Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Holmes, Counsel, instructed by GMIAU.
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     The appellants, nationals of Nigeria, are a family comprising  father,
      mother, and two minor children. They appeal against  the  decision  of
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Birrell dated 5 June 2017, dismissing
      the appellants'  appeals  against  the  respondent's  decision  of  12
      February 2016 refused their human rights claim. That  claim  had  been
      made in representations dated 23 December 2015 which had  argued  that
      the family should be granted leave to remain on the grounds  of  their
      private and family life enjoyed in the UK.

2     The first and  second  appellants  have  made  a  number  of  previous
      applications for leave to remain, as set out in the  judge's  decision
      at [4] to [8]. Their assertion that they entered the United Kingdom as
      long ago as 1995 was rejected in a previous appeal decided by Judge of
      the First-tier Tribunal Lambert on 23 June 2014. The judge  held  that
      there was no adequate evidence  to  demonstrate  that  the  first  and
      second appellants had been in the UK prior to 2008.   In  the  present
      judge's decision, the judge proceeded on the  basis  that  the  family
      have enjoyed a private life in the UK since 2008 [30].

3     The third appellant was born in the UK  in  September  2008,  and  was
      seven years old at the date of application, and 8 � years old  at  the
      date of the appeal hearing before judge. The fourth appellant was born
      in the UK in February 2013, and was two  years  old  at  the  date  of
      application, and four years old at the date of appeal.

4     In the respondent's decision, the application for leave to remain  was
      refused on the grounds that neither the  first  nor  second  appellant
      satisfied the requirements for leave to remain in the appendix FM,  or
      on private life grounds under 276ADE  (1)(vi),  on  the  grounds  that
      there were no very significant obstacles  to  their  integration  into
      life in Nigeria. In relation to the third  appellant,  the  respondent
      accepted that he had resided in the United Kingdom for seven  or  more
      years at the date of application, but held, in relation  to  paragraph
      276 ADE (1)(iv), that it would not be unreasonable for  him  to  leave
      the United Kingdom. In relation to the fourth appellant  it  was  held
      that he did not meet the requirements of the immigration rules.

5     The appellants appeal came before the judge on  9  May  2017.  In  her
      decision, the judge held as follows:

      (i)   the appellants had a family life in the United Kingdom,  but  as
           they will be removed together, there would  be  no  interference
           with that family life [34];

      (ii)  the appellants have enjoyed  a private life  in  the  UK,  since
           2008 [36], [38];

      (iii) little  weight  should  be  given  to  the  report  of  Kathleen
           Whitehead, described as a social  work  student,  purporting  to
           provide an analysis of the best interests of the  children,  for
           reasons set out at [44 (a) - (d)] (which are not challenged);

      (iv)  the children are apparently happy,  well  adjusted  and  settled
           into school where they have friends, and the they attend  church
           with their parents [45];

      (v)   there is an education system in Nigeria [45];

      (vi)  it would be in the children's best interests to  remain  in  the
           UK, based largely on the fact that the third appellant has lived
           in the UK for more than  seven  years  and  that  education  and
           healthcare in the UK are better than in Nigeria [46];

      (v)   however, the judge expressed the view that  the  best  interests
           decision was not overwhelmingly in favour of remaining,  as  she
           was satisfied that they could pursue an education  (in  Nigeria)
           and are not presently at a particularly crucial stage  in  their
           education; there is nothing to suggest that they could not  meet
           new friends and attend church as they have in the UK [46);

      (vi)  the assessment of reasonableness of return, under S.117B(6) NIAA
           2002 must not focus on the position of the children, as had been
           made clear in the cases of  MA  (Pakistan)  &  Ors,  R  (on  the
           application  of)  v  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and   Asylum
           Chamber) & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and AM (Pakistan)  &  Ors  v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA  Civ  180
           [49];

      (vii) the appellants were not British and not entitled as of right  to
           benefit from the education system and other public  services  in
           the UK [50];

      (viii)      the appellants had never had lawful leave to remain in the
           UK had made a previous human rights applications and  an  asylum
           application, representing an adverse immigration  history;  even
           the respondent's IDI guidance said that the decision  maker  was
           entitled to take into account  an  adverse  immigration  history
           which can outweigh the best interests of children,  and  in  the
           judge's view, this was particularly so whether factors  advanced
           in favour of remaining were not overwhelming [51];

      (ix)  it was reasonable for the children to leave the United  Kingdom;
           whilst this would inevitably cause some distress  and  hardship,
           the judge was not persuaded  that  this  would  be  sufficiently
           grave to outweigh the wider interests of maintaining immigration
           control; they would be returning as a family  unit  to  a  place
           where the parents have spent the majority of their adult  lives;
           the first and second appellants had proved   resourceful  whilst
           in the UK and can focus that resourceful spirit in reintegrating
           into their home country; they are all members of a  church  that
           has links in Nigeria and could potentially provide a social  and
           emotional support if that were needed outside of the family unit
           every [52].

6     The appeal was dismissed.

7     In grounds of appeal dated 15 June 2017,  the  appellant  argues  that
      the judge erred in law in:

      (a)   failing to identify  the  'strong  reasons'  or  'countervailing
           reasons of considerable force' that outweigh the best  interests
           of children in this case;

      (b)    importing  a  precondition/criteria  on  that  the  appellant's
           children's best interest must  be  'overwhelming'  in  order  to
           qualify for a grant of leave;

      (c)   failing to deal with material factors other than the  third  and
           fourth appellant's access to education,  such  as  their  having
           been born in the United Kingdom, spent the whole of their  lives
           in the United Kingdom; social  and  cultural  factors  warranted
           consideration;

      (d)   (in this case, were the Respondent was not  represented),  going
           beyond the scope  of  the  refusal  letter,  in  breach  of  the
           guidelines in the case of Surendran v SSHD (19197);

      (e)   conducting her own Internet  research  on  the  availability  of
           educational facilities in Nigeria.

8     Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the  first-tier  Tribunal
      Hodgkinson on 19 December 2017 expressing the view  that  all  of  the
      grounds were arguable.

9     Before me, Mr Holmes, for the appellants, made an application to  rely
      upon  an  unreported  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal.  I   granted
      permission, but in any event subsequent to the hearing before me,  the
      case in question has been reported: MT and ET (child's best interests;
      ex tempore pilot) Nigeria [2018] UKUT 88(IAC) (1 February 2018).

10    There was no rule 24 apply from the respondent in this matter

11    Mr Holmes adopted his grounds. In particular, in  relation  to  ground
      (a), Mr Holmes referred to the guidance in MA Pakistan which indicated
      at para 46, dealing with a  child  who  has  been  present  in  United
      Kingdom seven or more years:

           '46  ... After such a period of time the  child  will  have  put
           down roots and developed social, cultural and educational  links
           in the UK such that it is likely to be highly disruptive if  the
           child is required to leave the UK. That may be less so when  the
           children are very young because the focus of their lives will be
           on their families, but the disruption becomes  more  serious  as
           they get older. Moreover, in these cases there must  be  a  very
           strong expectation that the child's best interests  will  be  to
           remain in the UK with his parents as part of a family unit,  and
           that must rank as a primary consideration in the proportionality
           assessment." (Emphasis added)'

12    Mr McVeety suggested that the appellant's first ground had more  merit
      than the others, and in relation to that ground, whilst not making any
      formal concession, he accepted that he was unable to put  forward  any
      proper argument to counter the appellant's ground of appeal.

      Discussion

13    Although the judge has directed herself in law at the [15] to [19]  as
      to the relevant law, including the guidance set out  in  MA  Pakistan,
      quoting from paragraphs 45 to 47 of that judgment, I find with respect
      to the judge that she has ultimately misdirected herself in law as  to
      the significance to be attached to a child having spent seven or  more
      years in the United Kingdom when assessing the child's best interests.



14    I do not find, contrary to the appellant's ground  (b),  that  it  was
      impermissible for the judge to ask herself at [46] whether or not  the
      best interests of the third child were 'overwhelmingly' in  favour  of
      remaining, because that question is itself posed in paragraph 36 of EV
      (Philippines) & Ors v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2014] EWCA Civ 874. It is appropriate  to  quote  a  slightly  longer
      extract from that judgement:

           35.   A decision as to what is in the best interests of children
                 will depend on a number of factors such as (a)  their  age;
                 (b) the length of time that they have been  here;  (c)  how
                 long they have been in  education;  (c)  what  stage  their
                 education has reached; (d) to what extent they have  become
                 distanced from the country to which  it  is  proposed  that
                 they return; (e) how renewable their connection with it may
                 be; (f) to what extent they will have  linguistic,  medical
                 or other difficulties in adapting to life in that  country;
                 and (g) the  extent  to  which  the  course  proposed  will
                 interfere with their family life or their rights  (if  they
                 have any) as British citizens.

           36.   In a sense the tribunal is concerned with how emphatic  an
                 answer falls to be given to the question: is it in the best
                 interests of the child to remain? The longer the child  has
                 been here, the more advanced (or critical) the stage of his
                 education,  the  looser  his  ties  with  the  country   in
                 question, and the more deleterious the consequences of  his
                 return, the greater the weight that falls into one side  of
                 the scales. If it is overwhelmingly  in  the  child's  best
                 interests that he should not return, the need  to  maintain
                 immigration control  may  well  not  tip  the  balance.  By
                 contrast if it is in the child's best interests to  remain,
                 but only on balance (with some factors pointing  the  other
                 way), the result may be the opposite.

           37.   In the balance on the other side there falls to  be  taken
                 into account the strong weight to be given to the  need  to
                 maintain immigration control in  pursuit  of  the  economic
                 well-being of the country and the fact that, ex  hypothesi,
                 the  applicants  have  no  entitlement   to   remain.   The
                 immigration history of the parents  may  also  be  relevant
                 e.g. if they are overstayers, or have acted deceitfully."

15    In MA Pakistan, the Court of Appeal noted that EV Philippines was  not
      itself a case involving a child who had been present for seven or more
      years (the child had been present for 3 years and 9 months): As per MA
      Pakistan para 49:

           "Although this was not in fact a seven year case, on  the  wider
           construction of section 117B(6), the same principles would apply
           in such a case. However, the fact that the child has been in the
           UK for seven years would need to be given significant weight  in
           the proportionality exercise for  two  related  reasons:  first,
           because of its relevance to determining the nature and  strength
           of  the  child's  best  interests;  and   second,   because   it
           establishes as a starting point that  leave  should  be  granted
           unless there are powerful reasons to the contrary."

16    The judge's error was, I find, not in considering  whether  the  third
      appellant's best interests were overwhelmingly in favour of remaining,
      as opposed to such conclusion only being arrived at  on  balance;  but
      rather, in failing to have regard to the guidance given by  the  Court
      of Appeal as to the  starting  position,  when  considering  the  best
      interests of a child who has been present for 7 or more  years.   Even
      within paragraph 46 of MA Pakistan, which the judge quoted within  her
      decision, the judgment provides that  there  must  be  a  very  strong
      expectation that the child's best interests will be to remain  in  the
      UK with his parents as part of a family unit.

17    There may be considerations pointing to it being  in  a  child's  best
      interests to remain in the UK, or to leave the UK, to  live  in  their
      country of nationality. The judge did not identify any  considerations
      positively indicating that it would be in the best  interests  of  the
      children to leave the United Kingdom  and  to  live  in  Nigeria.  For
      example, no family members were identified as existing in Nigeria.

18     Further,  in  assessing  what  was  in  the  third  appellant's  best
      interests, the judge does  not  address  a  number  of  considerations
      regarding the third appellant circumstances that  were  identified  as
      being relevant in EV Philippines at paragraph 35: (a) his age; (b) the
      length of time he has been in the United Kingdom; (d)  the  extent  he
      has become distanced from Nigeria; (e) how renewable  his  connections
      with Nigeria may be.

19    The judge does not, for instance, note that the  third  appellant  had
      been present in the United Kingdom for 8 � years, rather  than  simply
      seven; he has been in the United Kingdom the whole of his life; he has
      never been to Nigeria, and has no personal connections  to  it,  other
      than some uncertain connections that his parents may have  had  there,
      before they left, which would have been some point prior to 2008.

20    I am also of the  view  that  whereas  it  may  be  possible  for  any
      individual to leave one set of friends and to  forge  new  friends  in
      another country, the judge fails to consider whether it is in fact  in
      the third appellant's best interests to be required to do so. I  find,
      agreeing with the appellant's grounds of appeal, that  the  judge  has
      considered principally matters of education, rather  than  other  ties
      which the third appellant has, and would inevitably have,  to  the  UK
      (Ground (c)).

21    Bearing in mind the guidance at paragraph 46 of MA Pakistan that in  a
      seven year case, there must be a  very  strong  expectation  that  the
      child's best interests will to be remain in the UK, I  cannot  for  my
      part see how, in the discrete exercise of determining what was in  the
      third appellant's best interests, that it could  be  said  that  these
      were anything other than overwhelmingly to remain in the UK.

22    Further, in the judge's subsequent proportionality balancing  exercise
      there is nothing in paragraphs [45] to [53] to suggest that  she  gave
      the best interests of the third appellant significant  weight,  as  is
      required by MA Pakistan paragraphs 46 and 49. Further, para 49 of that
      judgement also provides that a child having been in the UK  for  seven
      or more years "establishes as a starting point that  leave  should  be
      granted unless there are powerful reasons to the contrary". The  judge
      does not direct herself that such powerful  reasons are required.

23    I would also observe, although do not  find  this  to  be  a  discreet
      error, that whereas the  judge  directed  herself  at  [49]  that  the
      assessment of the reasonableness of  return  must  not  focus  on  the
      position of the children, such a self  direction  would  risk  leaving
      relevant considerations out of account. When the question  is  whether
      it is reasonable for a child to leave the UK, it  seems  obvious  that
      the children's interest must be considered; the authorities  mentioned
      by the judge establish that the such assessment must not focus on  the
      position of the children exclusively; other  considerations,  such  as
      the immigration history of parents, can be taken into account.

24    It is not necessary for me to consider  the  appellant's  grounds  (d)
      and (e).

      Decision

25    I find that the decision involved the making of errors  of  law  which
      were material to the outcome of the appeal.

26    I set aside the judge's decision.

27    Upon my asking the parties for their views about the  forum  in  which
      the decision should be remade, Mr Holmes indicated that  he  would  be
      content for the matter to be retained in the Upper  Tribunal,  and  to
      make some further closing  submissions  as  to  the  remaking  of  the
      decision. Mr McVeety agreed with that approach.

28    I heard the oral submissions from Mr Holmes, and Mr McVeety.  For  his
      part, Mr McVeety confined himself to relying on the decision letter of
      12 February 2016.

      Remaking

29    Directing myself as to the considerations set out at paragraph  35  of
      EV Philippines, and Paras 46 and 49 of MA Pakistan, I  find  that  the
      third appellant was born in United Kingdom  and  has  lived  here  the
      whole of his life. He has never visited in Nigeria, as has  no  direct
      experience of living in that country. Although the judge  had  rightly
      found that the alleged expert opinion, expressed in the  statement  of
      Kathleen Whitehead, was to be given little weight, Mr  Holmes  invited
      me to treat the content of paragraph 6 of that statement as accurately
      representing the third appellant's wishes. Mr McVeety was content  for
      me to do so.

30    That paragraph sets  out  that  when  Ms  Whitehead  asked  the  third
      appellant about living in Nigeria, he had said he would not  want  to,
      saying that he likes his life in the UK and does not want to leave. He
      stated that he had never been to Nigeria but said he had seen violence
      on the news in Nigeria and this had  scared  him.  I  take  the  third
      appellant's views and wishes into account as a relevant  consideration
      in determining his best interests.

31    In the appellant's bundle at {47} the  third  appellant  names  within
      his school report, specific friends that he likes to  play  with.  The
      appellant's bundle also establishes that the third appellant has  been
      attending school, with very high percentage attendance {33}-{36},  was
      making good progress  {42}, was polite and had good manners, and is  a
      popular member of his class with lots of friends {45},  and plays at a
      local football club, where is a well liked member of the team {19}.

32    I also take into account, when hearing  this  appeal  in  March  2018,
      that the third appellant is now 9 � years old and his ties to  the  UK
      will have increased with further effluxion of time  since  the  matter
      cam before the First tier. I also observe that in another  six  months
      time he will be entitled  to  be  registered  as  a  British  citizen,
      although I do not in fact take that matter into account in my  present
      decision.

33    I find, with respect to the judge, that it is  overwhelmingly  in  the
      best interests of the third  appellant  to  remain  living  in  United
      Kingdom with his parents. I find that the  third  appellant's  removal
      would amount to an interference with  his  private  life  in  the  UK,
      developed entirely in the UK.

34    In determining whether it is reasonable for  the  third  appellant  to
      leave the UK, wider public interest considerations come into play  via
      the concept of reasonableness under s.116B(6) NIAA 2002 (AM  Pakistan,
      end of para 20). Conducting the  proportionality  balancing  exercise,
      the principal public interest considerations  militating  against  the
      appellants are  the  importance  of  the  maintenance  of  immigration
      control, and the adverse immigration history of the parents. I accept,
      following MA Pakistan, that at  this  proportionality  stage,  adverse
      factors such as the parent's immigration history  may  be  taken  into
      account.

35    I turn at this point to the now reported case of MT and ET. That  case
      also child from Nigeria. The mother, MT, had been the claimant  in  an
      earlier case of  Tologiwa  v  SSHD  [2012]  EWHC  2386  (Admin).  That
      judgement had suggested that consideration needed to be  given  as  to
      what circumstances may prevail upon the return of a family to Nigeria.
      However, when appellant MT's case later came before the Upper Tribunal
      in MT and ET, the Upper Tribunal observed that the  child  ET  had  by
      then been present in the UK for 10 years, and had no direct experience
      of Nigeria (para 31). The Tribunal did not in fact find  it  necessary
      to make any comparative analysis of the education systems  in  the  UK
      versus Nigeria (para 31, first and second lines), but held that on the
      state of the law as set out in  MA  (Pakistan),  there  needed  to  be
      'powerful reasons' why a child who has been in the United Kingdom  for
      over 10  years  should  be  removed,  notwithstanding  that  her  best
      interests lie in remaining. The Tribunal held at para  34  that  there
      were no such powerful reasons,  despite  that  appellant's  10  years'
      overstaying and a criminal conviction resulting in a  community  order
      for the use of forged document to obtain employment.

36    Although in the present case, the third  appellant  has  been  present
      for 9 � years, rather than 10, no real distinction between  those  two
      periods could properly be made in my  view.  Further,  the  first  and
      second appellants in the present case have no criminality, in contrast
      with the appellant MT in MT and ET.

37    I find in all  circumstances  that  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
      require the third appellant to leave United Kingdom, there  not  being
      sufficiently powerful countervailing public  interests  considerations
      to  make  the  third  appellant's   removal   proportionate   to   the
      interference that would to his private life if removed.

38    In relation to the position of the  first  and  second  appellants,  I
      find, applying s.117B(6) NIAA 2002 that the public interest  does  not
      require their removal from the United Kingdom, given that they have  a
      genuine and subsisting parental relationship with the third appellant,
      being a qualifying child, and where it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
      require the third appellant to leave United Kingdom.

39    Where there is no public interest in removing  the  first  and  second
      appellants, and where it would not be reasonable to remove the  third,
      I find that any suggestion that the fourth appellant, a  four-year-old
      child, might be removed from the  United  Kingdom,  whilst  his  other
      family members remain in the UK, would be disproportionate.

      Decision

40    I allow the appellants' appeals on human rights grounds.


Signed:                                            Date: 28.6.18
