Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Konwerski (father of the appellant)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a Polish national  born  on  20th  June  1982  and  he
    appealed against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  dated  17th
    November 2014 to deport him to Poland pursuant to paragraphs 19(3)  and
    21 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  ("the
    EEA Regulations").

Background

 2. The background litigation history is that the  appellant's  appeal  was
    initially heard and determined by First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian on
    19th June 2015  who  dismissed  the  appeal  on  29th  June  2015.   An
    application for permission to appeal  was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Sehba H Storey and Upper Tribunal Judge Craig and the matter  was
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  The  decision  then  came  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Fitzgibbon QC  who  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal.  That decision was appealed by the Secretary of  State  on  the
    basis that  although  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found  his  re-
    offending was assessed as being low, this did not equate to no risk  of
    re-offending, and that it was submitted that threatening members of the
    public with a handgun, whether false or not, placed  them  in  fear  of
    their lives and was a serious crime (Jarusevicius (EEA Reg 21 -  effect
    of imprisonment) Lithuania [2012] UKUT 00120 (IAC)).

 3. The matter came before me and I found a material error of  law  in  the
    decision on the basis of inadequate findings by the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge in relation to the appellant's risk of re-offending, and  whether
    the serious grounds of public policy or public  security  on  which  to
    deport the appellant,   (a  finding  which  was  not  accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State) had been made out, given the very serious nature of
    the offence that the appellant had committed  and  the  threat  he  had
    posed to society.

 4. I set aside the decision pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 ("TCE 2007") and preserved none of  the
    findings.  Having issued directions the matter was resumed before me.

Secretary of State's Decision to make Deportation Order

 5. The Secretary of State recorded that the appellant was convicted of the
    possession of an imitation firearm and theft on 28th February 2014  and
    sentenced on 15th  August  2014  at  Harrow  Crown  Court  to  2  years
    imprisonment. The appellant claimed to have entered the United  Kingdom
    on 1st June 2007 as an EEA  national  exercising  treaty  rights.   The
    Secretary of State disputed the date on which he entered  the  UK,  but
    accepted that he had been lawfully working here and  exercising  treaty
    rights since 2011.  Consideration was therefore given  to  whether  his
    deportation was justified on the grounds of  public  policy  or  public
    security and whether he represented a genuine, present and sufficiently
    serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society.
    It was considered there was insufficient evidence he had addressed  the
    reasons for his offending. The offences committed were serious, he  had
    a propensity to re-offend and the decision was proportionate under  the
    EEA Regulations. Consideration was given to  rehabilitation  but  there
    was no evidence that he had undertaken such  work  in  custody  and  he
    could work to rehabilitation in Poland.

 6. In the light of the serious criminal offence and the risk he could  re-
    offend it was considered  that  deporting  him  would  not  breach  the
    obligations under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
    2006. The Secretary  of  State  considered  the  Immigration  Rules  as
    setting out the position of the Secretary of State in Article 8  cases.
    The appellant had not lived for most of his life in the UK and was  not
    culturally  and  socially  integrated  and  there  would  be  no   very
    significant obstacles to his  integration  in  Poland.   He  spoke  the
    language, could seek support from friends and was  not  estranged  from
    the culture.  He had committed a serious crime. There  was  significant
    public interest in deporting him and no very  compelling  circumstances
    in his favour.  It was acknowledged that he had a  father  and  a  step
    mother with a British passport  in  the  UK  but  these  ties  did  not
    constitute ties over and above normal emotional ties. He had failed  to
    establish that any dependency existed.  With reference to Article 8 his
    deportation would not breach the UK's obligations under the ECHR.

The Law

 7. At the outset I confirm that the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    (Amendment) Regulations 2017 apply in relation to the amendments to the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016  to  Schedule  4.
    As such, notwithstanding the revocation  of  the  2006  Regulations  by
    paragraph 1(1), those Regulations continue to apply -

      a) In respect of an appeal under  those  Regulations  against  an  EEA
         decision which is pending (within the meaning of  Regulation  25(2)
         of the 2006 Regulations) on 31st January 2017.

 8. Thus, as Mr Clarke submitted, and I accept, the 'old'  EEA  Regulations
    continued to apply to the appellant.

 9. I set out those Regulations in connection with deportation as  follows.
    For the purposes of clarity I set out the Regulations  in  relation  to
    decisions taken to remove EEA nationals from the United  Kingdom  under
    Regulation 19(3) and (5):-

         "19(3)   Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), a person who  has  been
             admitted to, or acquired a right  to  reside  in,  the  United
             Kingdom under these Regulations may be removed from the United
             Kingdom if-

             (a) he does not have or ceases to have a right to reside under
                  these Regulations; or

             (b) he would otherwise be entitled to  reside  in  the  United
                  Kingdom under these Regulations but the Secretary of State
                  has decided that his removal is justified on  the  grounds
                  of public policy, public  security  or  public  health  in
                  accordance with regulation 21.

         ...

         (5)      A person must not be removed under paragraph (3) if he has
             a right to remain in the United Kingdom  by  virtue  of  leave
             granted under the 1971 Act unless his removal is justified  on
             the grounds of public policy, public security or public health
             in accordance with regulation 21."

10. In relation to decisions taken on public policy,  public  security  and
    public health grounds, Regulation 21 also applies:-

                "21.-  (1)   In this regulation a "relevant decision"  means
                           an EEA decision taken on the  grounds  of  public
                           policy, public security or public health.

                  (2)  A  relevant  decision  may  not  be  taken  to  serve
                           economic ends.

                  (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of  a
                           person with a permanent right of residence  under
                           regulation 15 except on serious grounds of public
                           policy or public security.

                  (4)  A relevant  decision  may  not  be  taken  except  on
                           imperative grounds of public security in  respect
                           of an EEA national who-

                           (a)     has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a
                               continuous period  of  at  least  ten  years
                               prior to the relevant decision; or

                           (b)     is  under  the  age  of  18,  unless  the
                               relevant decision is necessary in  his  best
                               interests, as provided for in the Convention
                               on the Rights of the Child  adopted  by  the
                               General Assembly of the  United  Nations  on
                               20th November 1989.

                      (5)   Where a relevant decision is taken  on  grounds
                           of public policy or public security it shall,  in
                           addition  to   complying   with   the   preceding
                           paragraphs  of  this  regulation,  be  taken   in
                           accordance with the following principles-

                           (a)      the  decision  must  comply   with   the
                               principle of proportionality;

                           (b)     the decision must be based exclusively on
                               the   personal   conduct   of   the   person
                               concerned;

                           (c)      the  personal  conduct  of  the   person
                               concerned must represent a genuine,  present
                               and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting
                               one of the fundamental interests of society;



                           (d)     matters isolated from the particulars  of
                               the case or which relate  to  considerations
                               of general prevention  do  not  justify  the
                               decision;

                           (e)     a person's previous criminal  convictions
                               do not in themselves justify the decision.

                      (6)    Before  taking  a  relevant  decision  on  the
                           grounds of public policy or  public  security  in
                           relation to a  person  who  is  resident  in  the
                           United  Kingdom  the  decision  maker  must  take
                           account of considerations such as the age,  state
                           of health, family and economic situation  of  the
                           person, the person's length of residence  in  the
                           United Kingdom, the person's social and  cultural
                           integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
                           extent of the person's links with his country  of
                           origin."

11. Under the EEA Regulations, there are  three  levels  of  protection  in
    relation to removal.  A decision may not be taken except on  imperative
    grounds for those  who  have  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    continuous period of at least ten years.  Secondly, a relevant decision
    may not be taken in  respect  of  a  person  with  permanent  right  of
    residence under Regulation 15  except  on  serious  grounds  of  public
    policy or public security; and thirdly,  for  EEA  nationals  who  have
    resided in the UK for less than  five  years  in  accordance  with  the
    Regulations, a relevant decision can only be taken on  the  grounds  of
    public policy or public security and in accordance with the  principles
    set out at paragraph 21(5) set out above and taking  into  account  the
    considerations set out in paragraph 21(6) set out above.

12. The first question to determine is whether the appellant has  permanent
    right of residence, and  which  level  of  protection  applies  to  any
    removal.  Further to Regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations:-

         "15.-    (1)  The following persons acquire the right to reside  in
                    the United Kingdom permanently-

                    (a)      an EEA national who has resided in  the  United
                        Kingdom in accordance with these Regulations for  a
                        continuous period of five years;

                    (b)      a family member of an EEA national who  is  not
                        an EEA national but who has resided in  the  United
                        Kingdom with the EEA national  in  accordance  with
                        these Regulations for a continuous period  of  five
                        years;

                    (c)      a worker or self-employed person who has ceased
                        activity;

                    (d)      the family member of a worker or  self-employed
                        person who has ceased activity, provided-

                        (i) the person was the family member of the  worker
                             or self-employed person at the point the worker
                             or self-employed person ceased activity; and

                        (ii)      at that point, the family member  enjoyed
                             a right to reside on the  basis  of  being  the
                             family member of that worker  or  self-employed
                             person;

                    (e)      a person who was the family member of a  worker
                        or self-employed person where-

                        (i) the worker or self-employed person has died;

                        (ii)      the family member resided with the worker
                             or self-employed person immediately before  the
                             death; and

                        (iii)     the worker or  self-employed  person  had
                             resided continuously in the United Kingdom  for
                             at least two years immediately before dying  or
                             the death was the result of an accident at work
                             or an occupational disease;

                    (f)      a person who-

                        (i) has resided in the United Kingdom in accordance
                             with these Regulations for a continuous  period
                             of five years; and

                        (ii)      was, at the end of the period,  a  family
                             member  who   has   retained   the   right   of
                             residence."

Level of Protection

13. The deportation  order  was  signed  on  17th  November  2014  but  the
    appellant was imprisoned on 15th  August  2014.   It  was  Mr  Clarke's
    submission that there was no  evidence  from  2009  to  2011  that  the
    appellant was exercising treaty rights.  Clearly, the appellant was not
    exercising  treaty  rights  in  accordance  with  the  EEA  Regulations
    following the signing of the deportation order and therefore needed  to
    demonstrate that he had exercised treaty rights from 17th November 2009
    at the latest.  It was the father's  evidence  that  he  had  submitted
    relevant tax and employment documentation in relation to the  appellant
    and I note an undated  letter  from  seven  signatories  at  Copenhagen
    Gardens including the appellant's stepmother stating that the appellant
    had worked with his father for the last seven years.

14. I considered the independent documentary evidence.  There  was  located
    on the file a  national  insurance  contributions  certificate  in  the
    apellant's name for the years 2010-2011,  2011-2012,  2012-2013,  2013-
    2014 and 2014-2015, but the schedule of an NIC contributions at page 35
    of the bundle did not indicate any payments had been made for  national
    insurance contributions Class 1 and 39 'self-employed' class 2 NICs for
    2012-2013 and only 41 for 2011-2012. There were no payments  for  2010-
    2011  and  no  credits  for  2011-2012.    For  2013-14,  there  was  a
    confirmation of a Jobseeker's Allowance claim dated 7th March 2014.   I
    sighted a tax calculation summary for 2012-2013 showing an  overpayment
    of  tax  for  �1,092,  clearly  for  the  year  ending  2013,  and   an
    acknowledgement of  an  application  for  a  budgeting  loan  from  the
    Department of Work and Pensions dated 11th December 2013.  There was  a
    further letter from the Jobseeker's Allowance dated 19th November  2013
    confirming alterations in the jobseeker's allowance payment.

15. There was a tax calculation for 2011 to 2012 showing a profit from self-
    employment of �3,682, and a further letter from  Jobseeker's  Allowance
    dated 14th December 2012 advising that the appellant could not be  paid
    Jobseeker's allowance from 8th November 2012 because he  had  not  paid
    enough Class 1 national insurance contributions.  I  did  note  despite
    the schedule showing NICs paid that there was a payment  of  �68.90  on
    6th October 2012 and a payment of �65 on  31st  March  2012,  but  this
    documentation alone does not persuade me that he was in  employment  or
    self-employment  between  2009  and   2011,   and   indeed,   the   tax
    documentation for self-employment for the appellant in relation to  6th
    April 2011 to 5th April 2012 showed that his business  started  on  5th
    July 2011.  There was a further NIC payment of �37.50.

16. Indeed the documentation in relation to the  years  2009  to  2011  was
    sparse. I noted of a letter dated 6th January 2012 from M-Team  PC  Ltd
    identifying that he was an employee at M-Team Property  Care  from  May
    2011 being paid a weekly �400 after tax.  Between 24th April  2008  and
    25th November 2010, there were various invoices paid to 'Radoslaw',  in
    the total sum of �659.50 but  mostly  the  invoices  did  not  identify
    whether they were payable to the father or the son,.  Included in  this
    amount, however, were invoices in the minimal sum of �224 in  the  name
    of R Konwerski.  There were no tax  declarations  in  relation  to  the
    period prior to 2009-2010.

17. Overall on a review of the financial evidence, I do not accept that the
    appellant was residing in the United Kingdom in accordance with the EEA
    Regulations prior to 2011, and therefore that he was  entitled  to  the
    'higher' level of protection from deportation under the EEA Regulations
    on the basis of permanent residence.

18. The Secretary of State had  stated  in  the  decision  letter  of  17th
    November 2014 the appellant claims to have entered in 2007  and  worked
    as a security guard, and he had provided various  documentary  evidence
    for periods in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, but provided no  evidence  of
    his continuous residence or of exercising treaty rights  in  accordance
    with the 2006 EEA Regulations for a continuous period  of  five  years.
    The appellant had the opportunity but failed to provide  evidence  that
    he had acquired a permanent right to reside by virtue  of  residing  in
    the UK under Regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations.

19. I have therefore considered whether the  respondent  was  justified  in
    removing the appellant on the grounds of public security with  relation
    to paragraph 19(3) and 21 of the EEA Regulations.

Regulation 21 Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006

20. I thus considered whether  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    complied  with  the  principle  of  proportionality  in  view  of   the
    seriousness of the offence, whether it is clearly based exclusively  on
    the personal conduct of the appellant and whether he remained a genuine
    present and sufficiently serious  threat  to  one  of  the  fundamental
    interests of society.   I also  take  into  account  the  prospects  of
    rehabilitation and the various factors in relation to Regulation 21(6).

Circumstances of Offending

21. On 9th February 2014 whilst  in  the  William  Hill  betting  shop  the
    appellant was in possession of a  carbon  dioxide  powered  pistol  and
    threatened two men with it.  On 28th February 2013  the  appellant  was
    caught shoplifting at Morrisons and  found  in  possession  of  another
    carbon dioxide powered pistol.  As set out by the Secretary  of  State,
    the existence of such guns in a community puts the public  at  risk  of
    serious harm, and indeed in fear of their lives, and indeed, should the
    gun have been used  the  impact  could  have  been  catastrophic.   The
    sentencing judge in his case at Harrow Crown Court made  the  following
    statements about the risk of harm:-

         "You appear before the court having pleaded guilty to  offences  on
         two indictments, the first concerning an offence that  occurred  on
         9th February 2014 of possession of an imitation firearm with intent
         to cause fear of violence.

         The second indictment relates to an episode on 28th February  2014,
         an offence of possession of an imitation firearm  at  the  time  of
         committing an offence and also the theft of a bottle of liqueur and
         a quantity of cheese.  ...

         These are serious offences.  Possession of any  firearm  in  public
         will nearly always attract a substantial custodial sentence.  Sight
         of such weapons strikes fear into the heart of others and certainly
         in relation to the first offence where deployed  by  you  for  that
         purpose.

         It is also a severely aggravating feature that the  second  offence
         only occurred nineteen days after the first with a weapon purchased
         after the earlier offence and while you were on bail.

         I also note that in respect of at least one of  the  offences,  you
         were under the influence of alcohol which is  also  an  aggravating
         feature, it  appears  that  you  have  had  a  very  serious  drink
         problem."

22. The question must also be asked is he a present threat? The question of
    the appellant's propensity to re-offend must be taken into  account  in
    relation to the threat to the public. It is noted that he undertook two
    offences  of  possession  of  imitation  firearms,  albeit   in   quick
    succession and following an  apparently  hitherto  unblemished  record.
    There were, however, according to the judge aggravating  circumstances.
    The Secretary of State considered that the appellant continued to  pose
    a threat and took the view that

         "... there  is  insufficient  evidence  that  you  have  adequately
         addressed the reasons for your offending behaviour ..."

         and:-

         "... it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  there  is  a  risk  of
         reoffending and continuing to pose a risk of harm to the public ...
         All the available evidence indicates that you have a propensity  to
         reoffend and that you represent a genuine, present and sufficiently
         serious threat to the public to justify your deportation on grounds
         of public policy."

23. There were three  reports  produced  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
    offending and the threat he posed.  The NOMS pre-sentence report  dated
    13th August 2014, the OASys Assessment Report dated 23rd March 2015 and
    the NOMS National Probation Service letter dated  27th  March  2015.  I
    have  considered  them  carefully.   The  appellant   was   effectively
    incarcerated between February 2014 and April 2015 when he  was  removed
    to Poland.

24. The whole premise  of  the  reports  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
    offending relied  on  his  reduction  in  alcohol  and  its  abuse  and
    'emotional management' and save for an assurance  from  the  father  in
    relation to the son's activity in Poland, there was limited evidence of
    any such reduction.  The  evidential  basis  for  concluding  that  the
    appellant had taken steps to address his drinking and his alcohol abuse
    was extremely sparse and relating to when he was in custody.

25. The NOMS Pre-sentencing Report dated 13th August  2014  was  undertaken
    when the appellant was in custody and referred to  his  alcoholism  and
    his experiencing withdrawal symptoms when in custody and his  intention
    to join Alcoholics Anonymous on release.  This report found him of  low
    risk of re-offending but although the risk was indicated as being  low,
    that does not mean that there is no risk.  Indeed,  it  is  noted  that
    should the appellant re-offend there was  a  "medium  risk  of  serious
    harm".

26. The pre-sentence report dated 13th August 2014 concludes that:-

         "My assessment of Mr Konwerski informs the court's decision and  to
         this end, I propose that he does not pose  a  significant  risk  to
         members of the public of serious harm by the commission of  further
         specified offences.

         In  terms  of  risk  reduction,  it  is  recommended  Mr  Konwerski
         undertakes work in custody to address his alcohol misuse issues and
         explores relapse prevention techniques  that  will  enable  him  to
         remain abstinent upon release."

    However, this report did contain internal inconsistencies, particularly
    the text, in that although acknowledging that the appellant  was  mild-
    mannered  and  courteous,  he  did  not  quite  appear  to  have  fully
    comprehended the seriousness of the  offences,  anticipating  an  early
    return to his former life and routine, and also that the report stated:-



         "It is my assessment that Mr Konwerski poses a medium risk of  harm
         to the public.  This means that there are  identifiable  indicators
         of risk of harm, in terms of Mr Konwerski's possession and  use  of
         weapons, and therefore, although he  has  the  potential  to  cause
         harm, he is  unlikely  to  do  so  unless  there  is  a  change  of
         circumstances".

27. The report goes on to identify the use  of  the  risk  assessment  tool
    called "The Offender Group Reconviction Scale (OGRS)" and the "Offender
    Assessment System" (OASys respectively).  Mr  Konwerski's  OGRS  score,
    "probability of proven re-offending", is 6% within  twelve  months  but
    increases to 11% within 24 months and although placing him in  the  low
    risk  category,  bearing  in  mind  the  dynamic  factors   that   also
    contributed to his offending, I am not persuaded in the  light  of  the
    sentencing remarks of the  judge  which  post-dated  this  pre-sentence
    report that the risk of re-offending and harm is sufficiently low as to
    show very limited risk of re-offending.  I have identified the relevant
    reports, particularly the OASys Assessment Report which appeared to  be
    heavily dependent on the pre-sentence report.  Nonetheless,  the  OASys
    Assessment was clear in its  conclusion  when  assessing  the  risk  of
    serious  harm  the  offender  posed  on  the  basis  that  if  released
    immediately back into the community, albeit a low risk in  custody,  he
    was considered to be a medium risk in the community and that there were
    current concerns about breach of trust.

28. I note that the OASys Assessment Report of 23rd  March  2015  was  also
    undertaken while the appellant was in prison and it records in relation
    to the first offence that the appellant intended to take the gun  which
    is legal in Poland to the park to "shoot" on the day  of  the  offence.
    On the day of the second offence he was in Morrisons when he decided to
    steal a bottle of vodka,  and  having  been  stopped  by  the  security
    officers he was found to be in  possession  of  yet  another  imitation
    firearm.  The OASys Report advises:-

         "Currently [my emphasis] this risk  is  not  immediate  due  to  Mr
         Konwerski's incarceration.  In a community the risk is likely to be
         greater if - Mr  Konwerski  is  misusing  alcohol,  poor  emotional
         management, fails to consider the consequences of his behaviour and
         thus repeats the same mistakes".

29. The OASys Report described the circumstances likely to increase risk as
    misusing alcohol, associating with an alcoholic anti-social peer group,
    poor emotional management, failing to consider the consequences of  his
    behaviour, repeating the same mistakes  and  unemployment  or  lack  of
    structure to the appellant's days.

30. I could find no specific reference  to  alcohol  reform  in  the  OASys
    Report dated 23rd March 2015.

31. The National Offender Management Service Report, the  later  assessment
    made on 27th March 2015, was drafted by a probation officer who had not
    actually met the appellant.  She based her brief report and conclusions
    substantially on the OASys Report composed when the  appellant  was  in
    prison.  She described him to be  at  low  risk  of  re-offending,  but
    bearing in mind the limitations on her report  as  just  identified,  I
    place limited weight on her report.  She identified that:-

         "I have sighted (sic) of a letter dated  the  2/12/2014  from  'The
         Rehabilitation  for  Addicted  Prisoners  Trust  (RAPT)  is   (sic)
         relation to Mr Konwerski's engagement in their services  whilst  in
         custody.  The letter confirms that Mr Konwerski  has  been  working
         with the substance misuse team since his arrival at HMP  Maidstone.
         It also notes that Mr Konwerski acknowledges his  personal  alcohol
         problems and accepts responsibility.  Mr Konwerski had  volunteered
         himself to undertake a programme to address his alcohol misuse  and
         completed this programme on 23/01/2015."

32. The letter from RAPT, however, was not produced and there was no report
    following his programme.  Although there were indications from the RAPT
    service that the appellant would engage there was no final report.  The
    only letter was 2nd December 2014 admitting him to the programme.   The
    prison medical records indicate that he has a limited understanding and
    use of the English language.  The medical report  dated  20th  November
    2014 also indicated that he "does not  want  to  engage  with  a  carat
    despite being given information about its benefit".  It was noted  that
    he had no previous convictions  prior  to  his  last  conviction.   The
    medical reports also indicated that this is an appellant who  had  been
    drinking  since  he  was  16  years  old  and  that  his  drinking  was
    'exacerbated' by his break up with his girlfriend.  Although the  OASys
    Report was undertaken on the basis that he was not drinking  in  prison
    and that he had admitted himself to the RAPT programme,  he  maintained
    he successfully completed there was no indication  of  a  final  report
    from RAPT

33. There was nothing from  Alcoholics  Anonymous  in  Poland.   There  was
    little firm evidence of the appellant addressing his  substance  misuse
    save for whilst he was in prison.

34. At the resumed hearing before me Zdzislaw Konwerski attended  and  gave
    evidence as the father of the appellant.  I had  specifically  given  a
    direction in the error of law decision following the hearing  at  which
    the father was present, whereupon I had set aside the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, instructing that any further evidence in  relation
    to the appellant's alcohol reform  and  recovery,  but  no  documentary
    evidence was received.

35. The father confirmed that he himself had been an alcoholic and that  he
    was in contact with the appellant twice a week, but he had not  visited
    him.  He  confirmed  that  he  had  been  involved  in  setting  up  an
    Alcoholics Anonymous group in Poland 26 years ago and someone had  told
    him that his son had been attending.  He gave evidence that  there  was
    no letter from the group confirming his son's  attendance  because  the
    group was anonymous, but he had received information that he  had  been
    with the group three times a week.   He  confirmed  that  his  son  was
    living in a hostel and that previously when in the UK his son had  been
    living with him.  For some time he had continued to  see  his  friends,
    with whom his son socialised, a few times a week on his way to and from
    work, but he no longer saw them.  He confirmed that if his son returned
    he would live with him.

36. He was asked under cross-examination whether he had undergone any other
    therapeutic work and confirmed that, in fact,  he did not know  whether
    had attended any other coursers.  He confirmed that the appellant had a
    grandmother in Poland living in the same  town  and  at  one  point  he
    stated that he would see his grandmother and towards  the  end  of  the
    hearing he stated that he did not see her.  Altogether the  father  was
    persuaded that the son had attended the Alcoholics  Anonymous  meeting,
    but when questioned closely he said that he only had been told  by  his
    friends that he had done so.  The father confirmed that  he  could  not
    know for certain that the appellant attended  an  Alcoholics  Anonymous
    group in Poland and it was only what he was being told by a  member  of
    that group who remained unidentified.  There was no statement  to  that
    effect, no statement from any official in the organisation.

37. I place very little weight on the father's evidence on the  basis  that
    it was essentially hearsay and there was no confirmation by way of  any
    documentary evidence  to  support  the  contention  that  the  son  had
    undergone alcohol reform. The father had not visited the  appellant  in
    Poland although I accept he may have contact with him.  Mr Clarke  made
    the pertinent point that should he return it may well be that he  would
    associated with  is  previous  friends  again.   Bearing  in  mind  the
    importance on the evidence of recovery  and  which  the  appellant  had
    every opportunity to produce evidence  that  his  alcoholism  has  been
    addressed and which remains the source of his offending behaviour, I am
    not satisfied that the appellant  does  not  continue  to  represent  a
    genuine and present threat. I state this with the reports I have  cited
    in mind.

38. I took into account the father's evidence and I can understand that the
    father is concerned for the welfare of  his  son,  particularly  as  he
    explained that he himself was an alcoholic and had assisted in  setting
    up the  Alcoholics  Anonymous  group  in  Poland.   The  appellant  had
    explained in his witness statement that his mother  died  in  2006  and
    this must have had an impact on him.  Subsequently he asserts  that  he
    worked assisting his father as a gardener cum builder but I  also  note
    that he was claiming Jobseeker's Allowance.  His time in the UK was  as
    an adult and he committed offences as an older adult.

39. I can accept that a risk of serious harm is discrete from a risk of re-
    offending, but as I have explained, as indicated  in  the  pre-sentence
    report dated 13th August  2014  there  was  no  evidence  that  he  had
    explored relapse prevention techniques.

40. The Probation Service identified his prospects of rehabilitation  would
    be served by him receiving ongoing support  from  his  father,  but  as
    identified,  his  father  was  unable  to  prevent  his  dissent   into
    alcoholism and to prevent his commission of the offences  in  question.
    I am not persuaded that his rehabilitation prospects  are  stronger  in
    the UK than they are in Poland in the light of all the circumstances.

41. Of significance is that the son, according  to  the  father,  has  been
    living in Poland now for at least two years and he was, I note, removed
    to Poland on 16th April 2015 and he appears to have work.

42. In terms of rehabilitation I take note of the principles  in  MC  (Essa
    principles recast) Portugal [2015] UKUT 00520 (IAC) which sets out that

    'Where relevant (see (4) above) such prospects are a factor to be taken
    into account in the proportionality assessment required  by  regulation
    21(5) and (6) ((Dumliauskas [41]).


    ...


    Gauging such prospects requires assessing  the  relative  prospects  of
    rehabilitation in the host Member State as compared with those  in  the
    Member State of origin, but, in the absence of evidence, it is  not  to
    be assumed that prospects are materially different in that other Member
    State (Dumliauskas [46], [52]-[53] and [59]).


    Matters  that  are  relevant  when  examining  the  prospects  of   the
    rehabilitation of offenders include family ties  and  responsibilities,
    accommodation, education, training, employment, active membership of  a
    community and the like (Essa (2013) at [34]). However, lack of   access
    to a Probation Officer or equivalent in the other Member  State  should
    not, in general, preclude deportation (Dumliauskas [55])


    In the absence of integration and a right of permanent  residence,  the
    future prospects of integration cannot be a weighty factor (Dumliauskas
    [44] and [54]). Even when such prospects have significant  weight  they
    are not  a  trump  card,  as  what  the  Directive  and  the  2006  EEA
    Regulations  require  is  a  wide-ranging  holistic  assessment.   Both
    recognise that the more  serious  the  risk  of  reoffending,  and  the
    offences that a person may commit, the greater the right  to  interfere
    with the right of residence (Dumliauskas at [46] and [54]').

43. In relation to his rehabilitation I note that the appellant has  family
    in the UK and I take into account the father's desire to have  his  son
    with him, but they were unable  to  prevent  him  from  committing  the
    offences for which he has been convicted and are  unlikely  to  provide
    with the necessary support to aid his  rehabilitation  and  reduce  his
    risk of offending.   It is open to the father to visit the son which he
    has not done since he left in April 2015.  He has not always lived with
    his father and step mother and there was no indication save  for  close
    emotional bonds that the ties were beyond normal emotional ties or that
    there was any real dependency.  There is no evidence to suggest that he
    would be unable to work  towards  rehabilitation  in  Poland,  although
    there would appear to be no evidence to that effect, equally there  was
    no evidence that there were any courses or avenues  for  rehabilitation
    available in the UK.  I am not  satisfied  on  the  evidence  that  his
    deportation to Poland prejudices the prospect of his rehabilitation and
    the interference in his rehabilitation would  indeed  be  proportionate
    and justified when balanced against the continuing risk he posed to the
    public.

44. The appellant had friends in the UK with whom he was  associating  when
    offending and there was no evidence that  they  had  departed.  As  the
    appellant would appear to have casual work in Poland and there  is  the
    availability of AA meetings in Poland, I find  that  his  prospects  of
    rehabilitation are likely to be  greater  abroad  particularly  as  his
    level of Polish appears to be more advanced than English.   That  said,
    limited weight needs to be attached to his rehabilitation  in  view  of
    the level of protection that the appellant is entitled to owing to  his
    length of residence (in accordance with  the EEA  Regulations)  in  the
    UK.

45. I have considered the principles in relation to paragraph 21(5) and for
    convenience I repeat the sentencing remarks the judge made in this case
    about the risk of harm:-

         "You appear before the court having pleaded guilty to  offences  on
         two indictments, the first concerning an offence that  occurred  on
         9th February 2014 of possession of an imitation firearm with intent
         to cause fear of violence.

         The second indictment relates to an episode on 28th February  2014,
         an offence of possession of an imitation firearm  at  the  time  of
         committing an offence and also the theft of a bottle of liqueur and
         a quantity of cheese. Briefly stated, the offence committed on  9th
         February was as follows or in the following circumstances.

         You were at the William  Hill  betting  shop  in  Acton  with  some
         friends.  Two men paid you and your friends some attention  because
         of the noise you were  making.   You  asked  them  what  they  were
         looking at, approached them and lifted your top  to  reveal  a  gun
         concealed in your waistband.   It  was  a  carbon  dioxide  powered
         pistol.

         On 28th February, you were caught shoplifting at Morrisons.  Whilst
         being searched by the security staff,  they  found  another  carbon
         dioxide powered pistol.   You  pleaded  guilty  to  these  offences
         following a Goodyear indication on the day  fixed  for  trial,  you
         previously having entered pleas of not guilty.

         ...

         In relation to the offence on 9th February, you said, 'I  accept  I
         said to a man, 'What the fuck are you looking at?' and  showed  him
         the gun.  I accept this was to scare him but I did  not  intend  to
         threaten him further.  I did not say I would kill him.'

         ...

         These are serious offences.  Possession of any  firearm  in  public
         will nearly always attract a substantial custodial sentence.  Sight
         of such weapons strikes fear into the heart of others and certainly
         in relation to the first offence where deployed  by  you  for  that
         purpose.

         It is also a severely aggravating feature that the  second  offence
         only occurred nineteen days after the first with a weapon purchased
         after the earlier offence and while you were on bail.

         I also note that in respect of at least one of  the  offences,  you
         were under the influence of alcohol which is  also  an  aggravating
         feature, it  appears  that  you  have  had  a  very  serious  drink
         problem."

46. As  indicated  in  the  reasons  for  refusal,  shoplifting  is  not  a
    victimless  crime  and  if  the  appellant  failed  to  recognise   the
    implications of his offence he would act in this way again in the  same
    circumstances.

47. Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of  public  policy  or
    public security in relation to a person who is resident in  the  UK,  a
    decision maker must take into account considerations such as age, state
    of health, family and economic situation of  a  person  and  length  of
    residence in the UK and the person's social  and  cultural  integration
    into the UK and the extent of the person's links with  his  country  of
    origin.

48. The appellant is now nearly 34 years of  age  and  has  alcohol-related
    epilepsy.  His father and mother live in the UK, but I note  there  was
    indication in the papers that the appellant has cousins in  Poland  and
    his grandmother lives in the same town as him in Poland.  The appellant
    does not live with his grandmother and the father gave me contradictory
    evidence as to whether he was in contact with his grandmother  or  not.
    Initially the father confirmed that he saw his grandmother on a regular
    basis and then stated that he had nothing to do with  his  grandmother.
    This undermined the credibility of the  appellant's  father's  evidence
    and which I did not find to be reliable because of the  contradictions.



49. With reference to the appellant's integration, the father  stated  that
    the appellant had worked as a security guard in the UK but there was no
    evidence that the appellant had lived in the UK on a  continuous  basis
    in accordance  with  the  EEA  Regulations  prior  to  2011  and  these
    circumstances I have analysed above.  The appellant was  imprisoned  in
    2014 and removed from the United Kingdom in April 2015.  His period  of
    imprisonment undermines the notion  of  integration  into  the  UK,  as
    indeed do his offences.  He had produced only limited evidence of  ties
    to the United Kingdom and it would appear that he was associating  with
    an anti-social group of friends whilst in the UK. The father  confirmed
    during his evidence  that  he  did  continue  to  see  the  appellant's
    friends, albeit he had not seen them  lately  and  indicated  that  the
    appellant would live with his father and stepmother should he return to
    the United Kingdom, but then move to his own place.

50. I have taken into account the statement of the appellant and noted  his
    remorse and contrition and the closeness of the  relationship  that  he
    has with his father and his stepmother. I note that he identified  that
    he had lived in the UK for 14 years but told the medical services  that
    he had lived in the UK for just five years   I  have  also  taken  into
    account the statement of his step mother.  I am  aware  that  they  are
    fond of each other but conclude ultimately that she and his father  are
    free to visit the appellant in Poland.   I  have  also  considered  the
    evidence of Dr Sarnicki dated 12th April 2015 and appreciate the impact
    on the father's health and difficulty in which that this has placed the
    father but this  does  not  outweigh  the  protection  that  should  be
    afforded to the public.

51. There is no evidence to suggest the appellant  was  in  a  position  of
    being estranged from Poland because of his integration or private  life
    in this country, and such that any reintegration in Poland  would  have
    the effect of undue hardship.  Indeed, the appellant, according to  the
    father, now lives in a hostel  in  Poland  and  is  working  wne  where
    because of the language he  is  able  to  make  a  different  group  of
    friends.

52. Overall, given the threat of serious harm that he posed to the  public,
    his personal circumstances do not  outweigh  the  requirement  for  his
    deportation and the decision to remove him is justified,  proportionate
    and in accordance with the principles under Regulation 21(5).

53. In sum, the  appellant  was  sentenced  on  15th  August  2014  and  as
    indicated in the decision letter of the  Secretary  of  State  of  17th
    November 2014 the appellant had  not  produced  evidence  that  he  had
    adequately addressed the reasons  for  his  offending  or  successfully
    completed any such programme or addressed the issues that  led  him  to
    commit the offences in question whilst in custody.  He still  has  not.
    In the light of the nature of the offences, in the light of the reports
    as drafted which make specific reference to the need for control of his
    alcoholism and his peer group, and in the light of the lack of specific
    evidence in  relation  to  his  reformation  of  alcohol  misuse  post-
    incarceration, and in the light of the continuing absence of  any  firm
    documentary evidence in relation to his addressing his problems, I find
    that the appellant remains a risk of posing serious harm to the  public
    and if it occurred that it would be serious harm  would  be  of  medium
    risk.

54. He therefore continues to pose and  represent  a  genuine  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society.  The offence itself was a serious offence, is reflected  in
    the sentencing remarks of the  judge  and  the  length  of  the  prison
    sentence (2 years) which  was  given  to  the  appellant.   It  is  not
    reasonable to leave the public vulnerable  to  the  potential  for  the
    appellant to re-offend.  Brandishing a gun in public,  particularly  in
    the current climate, and placing people in fear of their lives can only
    be construed as serious. It is a fundamental interest of  society  that
    the law, an integral part  of  the  democratic  constitutional  system,
    should be complied with and upheld and that citizens are not placed  in
    fear of their lives from someone threatening  them  with  an  imitation
    firearm.   The  deportation  order  was  proportionate   in   all   the
    circumstances.

The Immigration Rules and Article 8

55. I turn to a consideration of Article 8 and apply the Immigration  Rules
    at paragraphs A362 and paragraphs 398 to 399D.  As set  out  in  Hesham
    Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60, the question is sterile as  to  whether  the
    Rules are a complete  code  or  not  and  what  is  important  is  that
    Parliament's view is taken into account as expressed in the Immigration
    Rules and set out at Section 117A to D in Part 5A of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Although the  Immigration  Rules  and
    Part 5A of the 2002 Act do not apply directly to EEA nationals, Article
    8 applies to all and  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the  statute  gives
    expression to Parliament's view of the public interest.

56. The appellant claims  that  his  father  and  his  stepmother  and  two
    stepsisters live in the United Kingdom and that he is single and has no
    children.  Although the  appellant  had  stated  that  his  father  was
    unwell, his father was able to attend court and indeed was  married  to
    his stepmother and has access to the NHS system.

57. The appellant's deportation is conducive to the public good and in  the
    public interest as he has been convicted of an offence for which he has
    been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than four years  but
    at least twelve months.

58. When considering the appellant's Article 8 claim paragraph 399A of  the
    Immigration  Rules  is  relevant  and  sets  out  the   exceptions   to
    deportation, specifically:-

      a) the foreign criminal has  been  lawfully  resident  in  the  United
         Kingdom for most of his life, and

      b) the foreign criminal is socially and culturally integrated  in  the
         United Kingdom, and

      c) there would be very significant obstacles to the foreign criminal's
         integration into  the  country  to  which  he  is  proposed  to  be
         deported.

59. The appellant has not lived lawfully in the UK for most  of  his  life,
    bearing in mind that he had committed a  serious  offence  against  the
    interests of British society and had provided no evidence he  had  made
    any positive contribution to society.  I am not satisfied that  he  was
    socially and culturally integrated.

60. There are no very significant obstacles to his integration into Poland.
     He has lived there for most of his life, has been living  there  since
    2015, has no language barriers, has family there and has been  able  to
    find accommodation, and according to the father, work in Poland.  There
    is nothing to suggest he was estranged from the culture  of  Poland  or
    that he cannot resettle.  Indeed he must have been educated there.

61. I then must turn to whether there are  very  compelling  circumstances,
    (by virtue of the Immigration Rules and Section 117D of the Section 117
    of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002),  such  that   the
    appellant should not  be  deported.   There  is  a  significant  public
    interest in deporting  the  appellant  because  he  was  convicted  for
    possession of an imitation firearm, theft and possessing  an  imitation
    firearm with intent to cause  fear  or  violence.   He  would  need  to
    provide a very strong Article 8 claim over and above the  circumstances
    described in the exceptions, but has provided no such evidence.

62. The appellant has a father, stepmother and  siblings  in  the  UK,  but
    these are relationships with adults and do not constitute  family  life
    without further elements of dependency beyond normal emotional ties and
    he had failed to establish that any such dependency  existed.   Indeed,
    the appellant has now been living abroad since the offences and I  must
    consider the appeal as at the date of the hearing before me.

63. I note that he has alcohol-related epilepsy, but there is no indication
    that he would be unable to access medical care in Poland and  there  is
    no indication that he has reached the threshold required under  Article
    3 of the ECHR.

64. In view of the offences that have been committed  I  am  not  persuaded
    that any compelling circumstances  on  human  rights  grounds  are  put
    forward which outweigh the public interest.  I  therefore  dismiss  the
    appeal.
