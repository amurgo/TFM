                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal  against  a  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Sullivan ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 14  August  2019
    by which the appellant's appeal against a decision of the respondent to
    refuse to grant international protection was dismissed.

 2.  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Macdonald   granted
    permission on all grounds.


Anonymity

 3. The Judge issued an anonymity direction. There was no request from  the
    representatives to set aside  this  direction  and  so  I  confirm  the
    following direction:

         Unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise no report of
         these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall directly
         or indirectly identify the appellant. This  direction  applies  to,
         amongst others, the appellant and the respondent.  Any  failure  to
         comply with this direction could give rise  to  contempt  of  court
         proceedings. I do so in order to avoid a likelihood of serious harm
         arising to the appellant from the content of the  protection  claim
         being made public.

Background

 4. The appellant is a national of Nigeria. She sought leave to enter  this
    country as a visitor in 2011 seeking to visit her  fianc�,  'LC'.  This
    application was refused on 19 September 2011. She subsequently  secured
    entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant enjoying leave  to  enter
    until 13 May 2014. Prior to her arrival, but after her application  for
    entry clearance, LC suffered a heart attack and fell into  a  coma.  He
    died on 31 January 2013, after the appellant's arrival in this  country
    on 30 December 2012,

 5. The appellant applied for and secured leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General)  Migrant  until  13  February  2016,  but  such   leave   was
    subsequently curtailed on 16 December 2014 after her sponsoring college
    surrendered its Tier 4 licence. Her  leave  to  remain  expired  on  17
    February 2015.

 6. The applicant claimed asylum on 1 March 2017 detailing that she  was  a
    victim of trafficking and forced  labour  in  Nigeria  and  Ghana.  She
    stated that her mother died when she was aged around  5  and  she  then
    lived with a succession of relatives many of whom ill-treated her.  She
    ran away and travelled to  Lagos  where  she  initially  lived  on  the
    streets and was subjected to rape. She travelled to Ghana when she  was
    aged 19 or 20 and worked in a restaurant. She was  given  menial  tasks
    and  paid  very  little.   Living  conditions  were   poor.   She   was
    subsequently introduced to prostitution and earned money in this manner
    from 2008 to 2010. In 2010 she met LC on an online dating  website.  He
    visited her in Ghana and secured a flat for her. He placed  �10,000  in
    her account to enable her to satisfy the financial requirements of  her
    Tier 4 (General) application.

 7. On 18 September  2019  the  appellant  was  referred  to  the  National
    Referral Mechanism as a potential victim of trafficking and slavery. On
    2 September 2017 there were found to be reasonable grounds that she was
    a victim, but on 29 October 2018 the Competent Authority assessed  that
    there were not conclusive grounds to show her to have been a victim  of
    trafficking.

 8. The respondent refused the application for international protection  by
    way of a decision dated 23 January 2019. The respondent did not  accept
    the appellant's credibility identifying multiple discrepancies  in  her
    account.

Hearing before the FtT

 9. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Taylor  House  on  16  July
    2019. The Judge determined that the  appellant  was  not  a  victim  of
    trafficking or that she was forced into prostitution in  Ghana  and  so
    did not meet the requirements for international protection.

10. The appellant relied upon a report from  Dr  Stephen  Ginn,  consultant
    psychiatrist,  who,  having  considered  medical   reports   previously
    prepared with regard  to  the  appellant,  confirmed  the  pre-existing
    diagnosis of a depressive order. Dr Ginn  further  concluded  that  the
    appellant suffered from dysthymia (mood disturbance) with sub-threshold
    depressive symptoms of an underlying emotionally  unstable  personality
    disorder. The Judge accepted the diagnosis of  dysthymia.  She  further
    accepted at [23] that the  appellant  suffers  from  some  symptoms  of
    depression and anxiety.

11. The Judge was not satisfied that the appellant meets all  the  criteria
    for a diagnosis of PTSD, that  she  suffers  from  a  major  depressive
    disorder or that at the date of  assessment  there  was  a  significant
    suicide risk. The Judge was not satisfied that  the  existing  symptoms
    were due to a history of forced prostitution.

12. The  appellant  further  relied  upon  a  statement  from  Dr  Benjamin
    Lawrence, Professor of History at the University of Arizona and editor-
    in-chief of the African Studies Review, dated 26 August 2018. Professor
    Lawrence opined, inter alia, that the appellant is at extreme  risk  of
    being re-trafficked in both Nigeria and Ghana, observing  at  [175]  of
    his statement, 'I would venture that no single individual case  I  have
    ever previously examined from Nigeria would be as  vulnerable  as  [Ms.
    E].' He further opined at [179] of his statement:

         '[Ms E's] physiological  and  mental  health  issues  substantially
         increase her risk and jeopardy. [Ms E] faces a very  low  (possibly
         as low as 5% based on the information above that  95%  of  mentally
         ill are  treated  by  traditional  healers)  chances  of  receiving
         adequate prescribed psychiatric care, as recommended by Dr. Ginn in
         his psychiatric report. She faces a very high risk of  chaining  or
         other inhuman treatment ...  if  as  is  also  highly  likely,  her
         treatment  is  confined  to  traditional  healers  and  traditional
         medicine. She faces a very high likelihood of  experiencing  stigma
         and discrimination based on her condition.'

13. The Judge concluded, at [26] - [28] of the decision:

         'Having considered all of the evidence and noting  the  assessments
         of the two doctors  I  accept  that  the  appellant  suffered  ill-
         treatment at the hands of relatives when  she  was  a  child.  This
         included the imposition of chores and corporal punishment but  not,
         given the certificates at pages 477  and  478  of  the  appellant's
         bundle, deprivation of education. I  am  not  satisfied  that  this
         brings the appellant within the 1951 Convention. I find that  there
         is no obligation on the appellant to return to live with  relatives
         and that having lived independently in the United  Kingdom,  worked
         to support herself, found places to live there, successfully shared
         accommodation  with  others,  undertaken  training  in  the  United
         Kingdom, engaged  in  voluntary  and  church  activities  there  is
         nothing to show that she could not safely do the same in Nigeria or
         that it would be unreasonable to  expect  her  to  relocate  within
         Nigeria should she wish to avoid her  relatives  there.  I  am  not
         satisfied that any of them has the means, motivation or inclination
         to try to trace her now.


         I am not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  is  a  victim  of  human
         trafficking or that she was forced into prostitution in Ghana. That
         was the basis of her asylum claim. I am not satisfied that she  was
         trafficked or forced into prostitution there.


         I am not satisfied that the  appellant  has  no  contact  with  any
         family or friends in Nigeria; for example, in  her  latest  witness
         statement she refers to two childhood  friends  and  their  current
         circumstances. I am not satisfied that she would be without company
         or support in Nigeria. I am not satisfied that there is a real risk
         that in Nigeria she would be trafficked for the first time. I  find
         that she has not shown that she would be at real risk in Nigeria of
         being trafficked or otherwise persecuted.  The  appellant  has  not
         discharged the burden of proving that she is a refugee ...'

Grounds of Appeal

14. The grounds of appeal were authored by Mr  Mackenzie,  who  represented
    the appellant before the Judge, and can be summarised - with  reference
    to particular paragraphs - as:

         1)  The Judge failed to consider  whether,  on  the  basis  of  the
            accepted facts, the appellant was at risk of being trafficked on
            return to Nigeria.


                  'In this case, the Judge, despite rejecting her account of
                  past trafficking, accepted a number of factors potentially
                  making the appellant vulnerable in future, including  poor
                  mental health which, on the Judge's findings,  created  'a
                  volatile risk  of  suicide',  and  estrangement  from  her
                  family. Further  or  alternatively,  she  failed  to  make
                  findings on the witnesses who corroborated the appellant's
                  account that she was so estranged (if authority is  needed
                  for the proposition that  the  evidence  of  corroborative
                  witnesses must be assessed and  taken  into  account,  see
                  e.g. AK (Failure to  assess  witnesses'  evidence)  Turkey
                  [2004] UKIAT 00230)': [9]


         2)  The Judge failed to consider whether the appellant, having been
            accepted to be mentally ill and at risk  of  suicide,  would  be
            subject to ill-treatment in the course of traditional  or  other
            treatment in Nigeria.


                  'The evidence  before  the  Tribunal,  in  particular  the
                  report of Professor Benjamin Lawrence of the University of
                  Arizona, indicated that mentally  ill  people  in  Nigeria
                  were  at  risk  of  dangerous  and  degrading  traditional
                  treatment and/or social ostracism (for avoidance of doubt,
                  NO (Afghanistan) v. SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 876  makes  clear
                  that this kind of argument is not a 'health' or  'medical'
                  challenge of the sort dealt with in cases  like  N  v.  UK
                  (2008) 47 EHRR 39': [11]


                  'The Judge did not accept Professor Lawrence's  view  that
                  the appellant had been trafficked, but she did not  reject
                  (or indeed make any findings at all on)  his  evidence  of
                  the risks to which mentally  ill  people  are  exposed  in
                  Nigeria': [13]


         3)   The  Judge's  findings  of  credibility   were   vitiated   by
            misunderstandings of the evidence.


                  'It is well-established that a  material  misunderstanding
                  of the available evidence can constitute an error of  law:
                  E & R v. SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 49;  [2004]  INLR  268.  The
                  Judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's  account  of
                  past trafficking, as set out at  [25]  of  her  judgments,
                  were based on a number of errors and misunderstandings  of
                  the  facts,  without  which  she  could  have  reached   a
                  different view. In particular:


                      ...


                      The  Judge's  findings  do  not  reflect   what   the
                      appellant said about the period when she was  coerced
                      into  prostitution,  which  was  that  she  was  only
                      allowed outside to look  for  me  (asylum  interview,
                      Q162, RB B32). It was not her evidence that  she  was
                      not  allowed  out  at  all.  That  evidence  was  not
                      inconsistent with being able to join dating  apps  or
                      to meet her late Italian partner, [LC].


                      The appellant did not deny studying in Ghana: on  the
                      contrary, it was her case that  she  had  studied  in
                      Ghana, after meeting [LC] and ceasing to  work  as  a
                      prostitute. Indeed, the Judge's  finding  at  [25(c)]
                      contradicts that at [25(b)], where  it  is  correctly
                      recorded that she was claiming that she did study  in
                      Ghana ('she  was  also  able,  she  says,  to  attend
                      classes in Ghana)': [15]

15. DJFtT Macdonald granted permission to  appeal  by  an  order  dated  10
    September 2019 observing:

         'The grounds of  application  contend  that  the  Judge  failed  to
         consider the risk of future trafficking,  failed  to  consider  the
         risk of harm as a mentally ill person and erred in  the  assessment
         of credibility.


         While the Judge made a number of findings rejecting her account  of
         being trafficked in the past and negative credibility  findings  at
         paragraph 25 it is arguable, for reasons given in the grounds, that
         the Judge did not fully consider the appellant's explanations which
         might amount to an arguable error in law.'

16. No Rule 24 response was filed by the respondent.


Decision

17. At the commencement of the hearing I discussed matters with  Mr  Jarvis
    and Mr. Mackenzie. In his usual thoughtful and helpful manner Mr Jarvis
    accepted on behalf of the respondent the material error in law  alleged
    by ground 2. He further confirmed the respondent's position that though
    not raised in the grounds of appeal such material error was exacerbated
    by the failure of the Judge to adequately consider  additional  medical
    evidence provided by Dr Jolliffe in relation to the rapid  increase  in
    symptoms of PTSD,  depression  and  anxiety  should  the  appellant  be
    returned to Nigeria.

18. Whilst Mr Jarvis indicated that he was prepared to  argue  against  the
    merits of several of the issues identified within ground 3 he  accepted
    upon consideration that the appellant's arguments at  paragraph  15  of
    the grounds of appeal in relation to findings made at  paragraph  25(b)
    and (c) of the decision, which are identified at  [14(3)]  above,  were
    material errors of law. Such failures as to findings of fact  adversely
    affected the consideration of core elements of the  appellant's  stated
    history and were accepted to be material errors of law.

19. In such circumstances both representatives informed me that the parties
    considered the Judge's decision to be flawed by legal error  such  that
    it should be set aside.

20. The concessions made on behalf of the respondent are appropriate in the
    circumstances. The Judge has sought to consider a complex appeal before
    her with care. However, the risk to the  appellant,  flowing  from  her
    mental health concerns, of being re-trafficked and/or subject  to  such
    poor health care upon return to Nigeria as  to  breach  her  article  3
    rights was at  the  forefront  of  this  appeal  and  for  the  reasons
    identified in ground 2, and  accepted  by  the  respondent,  there  was
    inadequate consideration of this central issue such as to amount  to  a
    material error of law. Many of the complaints as to findings of fact in
    ground 3 do not identify errors of law, save for the two identified  at
    [14(3)] above and such material failings adversely infect core findings
    of fact. In the circumstances I allow the appeal on grounds 2 and 3 and
    so am not required to consider the merits of ground 1.

Remittal

21. As to remaking the decision and given the  fundamental  nature  of  the
    material error identified, I observe the submissions made by  both  Mr.
    Jarvis and Mr. Mackenzie that clear findings of fact will  have  to  be
    made when this decision is remade. Both advocates  submitted  that  the
    appeal should be remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  if  a  material
    error of law was established.  I have given  careful  consideration  to
    the Joint Practice Statement  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  Upper
    Tribunal concerning the disposal of appeals in this Tribunal that reads
    as follows at paragraph 7.2:

         'The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to  proceed  to
         re-make the decision, instead of remitting the case to  the  First-
         tier Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:-


             (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before
                the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or   other
                opportunity  for  that  party's  case  to  be  put  to  and
                considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or


             (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
                necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-
                made  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the   overriding
                objective in Rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to
                the First-tier Tribunal'

22. I have reached the conclusion that it  is  appropriate  to  remit  this
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision on all  matters.
    The appellant has enjoyed  no  adequate  consideration  of  her  asylum
    claim, to date and has not yet had a fair hearing.

23. The First-tier Tribunal and the parties should be aware that the  Court
    of Appeal has granted permission to appeal in the matter of AA  (Sierra
    Leone) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (C5/2019/0327)  as
    to whether those who are severely mentally  ill  can  form  part  of  a
    particular social group for the purposes of the 1951 UN  Convention  on
    the Status of Refugees and the hearing  of  this  appeal  is  presently
    listed for 18 December 2019. It may be that  the  appellate  matter  is
    concluded by consent, or the  hearing  is  adjourned,  and  so  at  the
    present time the parties should expect the  hearing  of  this  remitted
    appeal to proceed. However, the First-tier Tribunal will  no  doubt  be
    aided by being informed as to proceedings before the Court of Appeal.

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the judge's decision  promulgated  on
    214 August 2019 pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunal Courts and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

25. This matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  hearing
    before any judge other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Sullivan.



26. No findings of fact are preserved.


27. The anonymity order is confirmed.
