                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Bedford, Counsel instructed by Farani Javid
                    Taylor Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant a national of India applied for  leave  to  remain  as  a
    dependant spouse of Ms B M Bhakta a British national and the Respondent
    refused his application for leave to remain and made removal directions
    under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 on
    21 January 2014.

2.   The appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    I F Taylor (the judge) who on 6 August 2014 dismissed the appeal  based
    on the Immigration Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.

3.   Permission to appeal that decision was sought on  12  August  2014  and
    permission to appeal was given by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gibb on  27
    August 2014.

4.   The error of law hearing was considered by Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Robertson  (the DUTJ) where, Mr Bedford, referred to as Mr Beckett, did
    not pursue the issue of whether the Judge had made a  decision  on  the
    income requirements which paragraphs 4 to 11 of the grounds settled  by
    Mr Iqbal dated 12 August 2014.  Rather Mr Bedford proceeded in relation
    to ground 2 paragraphs 12 to 17 (not 2 as referred to in paragraph 2 of
    the error of law decision).  The DUTJ then recited at paragraphs 3 to 9
    of her decision the arguments that were canvassed by the parties.   The
    DUTJ at paragraph 18 considered the need for exceptional  circumstances
    or circumstances that demonstrate that removal would  be  unjustifiably
    harsh, were matters that the Judge had not borne in mind.  So  that  it
    was not clear on what basis the  Judge  had  decided  that  there  were
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently covered  by  the  Immigration
    Rules so as to move on with an Article  8  assessment  outside  of  the
    Rules.  Secondly it appeared that the DUTJ concluded  that  a  relevant
    consideration in the Article  8  assessment  was  whether  or  not  the
    parties could meet, even if not as required under the provisions of the
    Immigration Rules, the necessary financial thresholds by  reference  to
    specified evidence.  The DUTJ therefore posed the  following  questions
    for a resumed hearing:

    (1)  were there  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  the
         Appellant's partner continuing outside of the UK; and

    (2)  were there compelling reasons for the grant of  leave  outside  of
         the Immigration Rules and that the  focus  in  the  proportionality
         assessment would include Section 117A to Section 117D of  the  NIAA
         2002 so even if not under the financial provisions and requirements
         of Appendix FM that nevertheless the threshold of �18,600 could  be
         met.

5.   The DUTJ found that the Original Tribunal decision could not stand  but
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings of fact at  paragraphs  8
    to 20 of his decision were  preserved  as  a  starting  point  for  the
    resumed hearing.  These were:-

         "8.  In this case the burden of proof is upon the appellant on  the
             balance of probabilities and as this is an "in country" appeal
             I am  entitled  to  take  into  account  evidence  up  to  and
             including the date of hearing if it is appropriate to do so.

         9.   One of the issues in the refusal letter was that the appellant
             did not submit an original IELTS certificate.  The appellant's
             case is that he submitted this document on the 17 January some
             four days before the respondent's decision.  Whilst Mr Bramall
             was not prepared to formally concede this issue, he  asked  no
             questions and made no submissions about it  and  thus  I  find
             that an original IELTS certificate was submitted.

         10.  In the appellant's application which is dated 16 October  2013
             but was not sent to the respondent until the 21 November  2013
             he  relies  entirely  upon  the  income  of  his  wife.    The
             appellant's wife has a history of working  in  various  retail
             outlets and most recently she has  been  employed  by  Primark
             Stores earning a current  gross  annual  salary  of  �9023.57.
             This clearly falls some way short of the  minimum  requirement
             of  �18,600  but  the  appellant's  form  states  that  it  is
             anticipated that a further �9576.43  will  be  available  from
             what is described as prospective income.  This includes  self-
             employment as a beautician which according  to  the  sponsor's
             tax return for the year 2014 commenced on the 1 December  2013
             which is after the date of the appellant's application.  There
             is a third claimed source of  income  from  a  company  called
             Carewatch but the only evidence  in  relation  to  this  is  a
             contract of employment which does  not  indicate  whether  any
             employment has taken place or any income has been received.

         11.   The  principal  difficulty  with  the  above  is   that   the
             Immigration Rules, and  in  particular  Appendix  FM,  do  not
             permit any form of prospective income.  Furthermore, in  order
             to establish a certain level of income a number  of  specified
             documents are required and in the circumstances of  this  case
             they are particularly lacking with  regard  to  the  sponsor's
             claimed self-employment and employment with Carewatch.

         12.  Mr Iqbal on behalf of the appellant whilst not conceding  that
             the appellant could not succeed under Appendix FM stated  that
             he was making no submissions with regard to  Appendix  FM  and
             relied upon  Article  8  outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
             However, in the closing submissions of Mr  Iqbal  he  accepted
             that there was a lack of specified evidence which  meant  that
             the appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules although he
             did submit that in substance and reality the joint  income  of
             the appellant and his wife amounted to about  �1000  short  of
             the minimum  income  requirement  of  �18,600.   It  was  also
             conceded that the appellant could not succeed on private  life
             grounds under the Immigration Rules  and  in  particular  with
             regard to Paragraph 276 ADE.

         13.  For all the reasons  given  above  I  am  satisfied  that  the
             appellant cannot meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
             Rules with regard to family life or private life.

         14.  At the commencement of the hearing Mr Iqbal stated he had been
             handed some  P60s  by  the  appellant  which  related  to  his
             employment with Astrad  Limited  who  operate  concessions  on
             behalf of McDonalds, the fast food operatives.   There  is  an
             undated letter from somebody who identifies himself as Richard
             stating that the appellant worked for McDonalds  approximately
             20 hours per week.  Subsequently in evidence the appellant was
             to say that he worked for McDonalds between 20  November  2010
             and September 2013.  This  is  somewhat  curious  because  the
             appellant does not mention any employment  with  McDonalds  or
             anyone else in his application form nor does it feature in his
             witness statement or that of his  wife.   In  any  event,  the
             necessary specified evidence has not been submitted  and  even
             if I were to take the appellant's  income  for  the  financial
             year between 2012 and 2013 at face value which  is  apparently
             �8571 in combination with his sponsor's  salaried  income  the
             necessary threshold of �18,600 would still not be achieved.

         15.  In evidence the appellant adopted his witness statement  dated
             the 16 June 2014.  He set out the details of his  relationship
             with Ms Bhakta namely that they met on line in April  2013,  a
             relationship developed shortly thereafter and they married  on
             the 19 September 2013 and  now  reside  at  the  home  of  her
             parents in  Leicester.   The  appellant  also  states  in  his
             witness statement that his original IELTS certificate was sent
             to the Home Office on 17  January  2014  which  has  not  been
             challenged by Mr Bramall.  At  paragraph  15  of  his  witness
             statement the appellant states, "it would  understandably,  be
             very difficult for Bhavini to leave the United Kingdom to live
             with me in India.  She is  a  British  citizen  who  has  been
             living in the UK since birth.  Her life is well established in
             the UK.  She has a job here and all of  her  immediate  family
             are living in the United Kingdom.  It would be  too  difficult
             for her to uproot herself and leave her surroundings.

         16.  In evidence, the appellant states that his wife  was  born  in
             India and came to the United Kingdom when she  was  15  or  16
             years of age.

         17.  The appellant stated he had family in India comprising of  his
             mother and father and a brother who was working in Dubai.   He
             stated that his wife had visited India  three  years  ago  and
             that both English and Hindi were spoken at  home.   He  stated
             that his wife doesn't have any family  in  India.   He  stated
             that both himself and his wife were very close to  his  wife's
             parents and that they would not be able to live  without  her.
             He stated  that  he  had  not  discussed  with  his  wife  the
             possibility of relocating to India.

         18.  His wife, Ms Bhakta, gave evidence and she  also  stated  that
             she was born in India and came to the United Kingdom when  she
             was about 15 or 16  although  in  her  witness  statement  she
             stated that she had been living in the  United  Kingdom  since
             birth.  She stated that she had a job in  the  United  Kingdom
             and many close friends and that she  was  very  close  to  her
             mother as her only daughter and that she was also close to her
             father.  She stated that she has been to India twice before on
             holiday some three or four years ago and also  two  years  ago
             and on each occasion she spent two or three weeks there  in  a
             hotel.  She said most of her  relatives  were  in  the  United
             Kingdom although a maternal uncle lived in India but that  her
             cousins have all moved away elsewhere.  She  stated  that  she
             spoke English at  home  although  she  could  also  understand
             Guajarati and Hindi.  She stated that  her  family  were  from
             Gujarat.   She  also  accepted  that  when  she  married   the
             appellant she realised that his visa was about to expire.

         19.  It was submitted by Mr Bramall that the  appellant  could  not
             meet the Immigration Rules which I accept.  He also  submitted
             that following the case of Gulshan (Article 8 -  New  Rules  -
             Correct Approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) that in order to  go
             beyond the Immigration Rules there needs to be  arguably  good
             grounds amounting to compelling circumstances not sufficiently
             recognised under them.

         20.  Mr Iqbal submitted that the marriage was a genuine  one  which
             is not in dispute.  He further submitted relying on  the  case
             of R (On the application of) Nagre  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWCH  720
             (Admin) and other cases that the ordinary five  step  approach
             set out in Razgar should be followed in this  case.   He  also
             submitted that the substance and reality of the case was  that
             the appellant together with his wife  were  only  about  �1000
             short of the minimum income requirement of �18,600 and that it
             was highly unlikely that they would be a burden on the state."

6.   At the hearing the directions having been  given  for  the  service  of
    documents the Appellant's representatives served a supplementary bundle
    less  than  the  seven  days  directed  by  the  DUTJ.   There  was  no
    explanation for the late service nor apology given by  the  Appellant's
    representatives Farani Javid Taylor Solicitors.   It  was  left  to  Mr
    Bedford to present it.  In addition a supplementary chart was  provided
    showing the Sponsor's income from three sources.  First,  a  healthcare
    job between 5 September 2014 and 28 August 2015; Secondly, income  from
    Primark showing with reference to the  supplementary  bundles  earnings
    between 5 September and 10 July 2015 and in  the  supplementary  bundle
    page 25 earnings between August 2015 and  October  2015;  and,  Thirdly
    from Heena Art third job which essentially is doing skin decoration for
    various religious festivals earnings through self-assessment between  4
    August 2014 and  14  July  2015  in  what  is  essentially  a  seasonal
    activity.

7.   Mr Smart objected to the late production  of  the  material  not  least
    because he had had  no  time  himself  to  prepare  that  material.   I
    considered the matter including the  lack  of  explanation  as  to  why
    representatives had failed to provide it in proper time  and  the  fact
    that the Appellant was paying for the representation for Mr Bedford  to
    attend the hearing.  Mr Smart was unable to respond without  having  an
    opportunity to  read  and  consider  the  documents  and  to  know  the
    relevance of the additional material.

8.   I decided therefore that a break would be taken to enable Mr  Smart  to
    assess the evidence and if he wished to renew  an  application  for  an
    adjournment to make it after he had  had  an  opportunity  to  see  the
    papers.  A break was therefore taken between 10.40 and 11.15  following
    Mr Bedford having given a brief r�sum� of  the  matters  to  which  the
    documents related.  Following the break Mr  Smart  did  not  renew  the
    application to exclude the material or for an adjournment in  order  to
    prepare a fuller response and or prepare cross-examination.

9.   Mr Smart at the hearing for the first  time  produced  visa  processing
    times from New Delhi in respect of settlement visa  applications.   The
    visa information related to all decisions made up to July 2015 but  the
    information does not tell one how many applications were actually made.
     Nevertheless the processing time for applications was as  follows:  3%
    decided within ten days, 4% 15 days, 58% by 30 days, 90% by 60 days and
    100% by 90 days.  Those days are working days and exclude weekends  and
    public holidays.  Thus whilst rather simply it  might  originally  have
    appeared that 90 days was less than three months  it  is  of  course  a
    longer period; taking into account weekends and  public  holidays.   It
    was also  not  entirely  clear  whether  India  has  fallen  under  the
    requirements that applications for settlement are considered in the  UK
    or Abu Dhabi rather than at the post where the  application  was  made.
    Mr Smart relied upon the visa information essentially to argue that  an
    application could be made out of country and any period  of  separation
    was unlikely to be significantly long, thus  for  example  60  days  to
    process an  application  amounts  to  twelve  working  weeks,  90  days
    approximately eighteen working weeks and 120  days  24  working  weeks.
    Whilst Mr Bedford did not formally to some extent seek to object to the
    information provided from  the  UK  Government  website  be  addressed.
    Ultimately I decided I would consider the information for what  it  was
    worth and the submissions on the weight to be given  to  the  evidence.
    Mr Bedford's criticisms  were  really  that  the  information  was  too
    generalised to be reliable as to how long the process would  take  from
    application to decision.  He also indicated that of course if there was
    an adverse decision there would necessarily be the additional time  for
    the purposes of an appeal out of country.

10.  It was difficult to see on what basis an Article 8 claim could be  made
    in any event.  The position was that  the  Sponsor  met  the  Appellant
    after internet contact led to the development of a relationship in  May
    2013 and their religious marriage took place on 19 September 2013.  The
    Appellant lived with his wife's family and apart from the fact that  he
    has grown up in the United Kingdom it  was  said  his  wife  could  not
    return to India because she is a British national, living in the United
    Kingdom for many years and the Sponsor is rooted in the United  Kingdom
    where she worked.

11.  The basis of the Appellant therefore seeking to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom was driven around the fact that the  Sponsor  was  employed  in
    three jobs and plainly is a person  of  good  character  and  extremely
    hardworking.  Her three jobs are such that she could not get the  leave
    needed to return to India with the Appellant and would not be  able  to
    arrange holiday with all three employers to enable her to do so at  the
    same time.

12.  In addition the Sponsor did not  wish  to  leave  her  parents  in  the
    United Kingdom and go to a country she is not familiar with.   She  did
    not wish to be separated from  the  Appellant.   The  Sponsor's  father
    confirmed he and his wife get on well with the Appellant, have a  close
    relationship with him, that he was perfect for the Sponsor, the Sponsor
    and the Appellant enjoy a strong and loving relationship and have  made
    plans for their future together.   He  described  the  thought  of  the
    Appellant being required to return to his country  of  origin  as  very
    upsetting as the Appellant was well established in the  United  Kingdom
    with the Sponsor.  His opinion was that there would be adverse  affects
    on the Sponsor for it would be "... too  difficult  to  uproot  herself
    from the UK where she has been living  from  birth,  and  moving  to  a
    country where she has no home, job or family".  The Appellant's mother-
    in-law, the mother of the Sponsor, in not necessarily exactly the  same
    words said as her husband, about the Appellant and  Sponsor  and  their
    life together in the United Kingdom.

13.  The oral evidence at the hearing did not materially add to the  written
    evidence relating to the Article 8 issues.

14.  In essence neither the Appellant nor the Sponsor wished to  be  parted.
    It appeared to me that the Sponsor would not willingly return to  India
    with the Appellant but would visit if circumstances required by  taking
    holiday.

15.   It  seemed  to  me  that  there  was  a  point  when  the  Appellant's
    immigration status did become precarious: After 23 November  2013  when
    his Tier 4 leave to remain expired.

16.  I apply the cases of Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 particularly [21,  22,
    25].  It is clear that the Court of Appeal recognised that there may be
    occasions where insurmountable obstacles are not invariably a necessary
    precondition to the finding of a  breach  of  Article  8.   But  it  is
    possible that the case may be found to be exceptional for the  purposes
    of the relevant test under Article 8, in relation to precarious  family
    life, even where there are no insurmountable  obstacles  to  continuing
    life overseas.  As the relevance of insurmountable obstacles  continued
    to be a consideration then it was a matter what weight should be  given
    to it on the factual basis of the claim overall.

17.  I found the case of Hayat [2012] EWCA Civ 1054  at  paragraph  50  Lord
    Justice Elias pointed out by reference to certain  factual  matters  in
    the particular case it was relevant to the consideration of whether  it
    was legitimate to require an applicant to make his application from the
    home country: first, whether persons were  only  permitted  in  the  UK
    temporarily and therefore had no legitimate expectation of a  right  to
    remain.  Secondly, whether the family life can  continue  in  the  home
    country if one partner would for obvious reasons not wish to return and
    thirdly the length of any period of separation.  In this  case  I  find
    the likelihood was that an application properly prepared and documented
    meeting the specified requirements could reasonably be expected  to  be
    met within 30 days (six working  weeks)  or  60  days  (twelve  working
    weeks).  I see no reason to assume the worse that  the  additional  10%
    should be likely to occur unless  the  overall  time  was  90  days  or
    eighteen working weeks.

18.  Even if I was wrong about that it did not seem  to  me  the  length  of
    time was of such significance as  to  militate  against  return  or  to
    render the Respondent's decision  disproportionate.   Ultimately  there
    was very little to show what would be hardship or  harshness  to  their
    marital  relationship  arising  from  a  relatively  short  separation.
    Accordingly in connection with the questions raised  by  the  DUTJ.   I
    have considered whether there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  for  the
    Sponsor and for the reasons above concluded there were not.  Further  I
    did not find there were the kind of compelling circumstances  necessary
    to engage the provision under Article 8 ECHR  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.

19.  If I was wrong in that conclusion, I find as  a  fact  the  Appellant's
    life in the  United  Kingdom  engaged  Article  8  private/family  life
    rights. I find that his removal would have significant consequences and
    that the sponsor, although she does not wish to do so,  could  relocate
    with the appellant and maintain their private/family life in India: the
    preserved findings of fact set out above.   If I was wrong and  it  was
    not  reasonable  for  the  Sponsor  to  relocate  then  the  effect  of
    separation would be significant  even  if  relatively  short-lived  and
    Article 8(1) rights engaged.

20.  I find the respondent's decision was lawful  and  served  Article  8(2)
    purposes.

21.  I take  into  account  Sections  117A-C  of  the  IANA  2002  and  have
    considered the time the Appellant has lived and worked  in  the  UK  as
    well as his English language skills and the  marriage  to  the  Sponsor
    took place when the Appellant's status in the UK  ws  not  settled  but
    not truly precarious.  I find  the  public  interest  should  be  given
    significant weight  when  in  the  balance  with  the  Appellant's  and
    Sponsor's personal interests. I take into account that if  the  sponsor
    were to remove to India during the appellant's absence they  would  not
    have the necessary finances to return under the Immigration Rules.

22.  I find the Respondent's decision was proportionate  and  the  Appellant
    should make an out of country application for leave to  enter  for  the
    purposes of settlement.
