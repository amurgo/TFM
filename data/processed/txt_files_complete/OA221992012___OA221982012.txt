                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

Appellants:       The Appellants were  represented by their sponsor,
                  Muhammad Naveed
Respondent:   Ms Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal has its origins in successive, inter-related decisions made
    by the Entry Clearance Officer  (the  "ECO")  for  Islamabad,  Pakistan
    refusing the applications of the Appellants to enter the United Kingdom
    in the capacities of partner and child, respectively, of  the  sponsor.
    Following a hearing at which the  Appellants  were  unrepresented,  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT") dismissed their appeals.  Permission to
    appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  on  the  ground  that  the
    decision of the FtT was arguably wrong in  law  on  account  of  having
    determined the appeal by reference to the  revised  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules which came into operation on 09 July 2012.   Although
    the FtT made no finding regarding the legally  operative  date  of  the
    underlying applications to the ECO, its approach in law  was  expressed
    unequivocally in the following passage, in [13]:

         ".....  Appendix FM  must  supplant  paragraph  281,  even  if  the
         application had been received days earlier than  it  was  received.
         This is a pivotal finding."

 2. The applications to the ECO are dated  06  July  2012.   The  following
    details are recorded on the face of the applications:

    (a)  They were submitted online on 06 July 2012.

     (b) They were not accompanied by the requisite payment at that time.

     (c) They were signed by the Appellants on the same date.

    The practicalities were that the first-named Appellant, the mother, was
    to present the requisite payments at  the  United  Kingdom  Embassy  in
    Islamabad.  The undisputed evidence  is  that  whereas  she  began  her
    attempts to do so on 06 July 2012, registration and payment did not  in
    fact occur until 09 July 2012.  This  was  due  to  a  closure  of  the
    Embassy during  the  previous  days,  apparently  on  account  of  work
    pressures.  In his evidence to this Tribunal, the sponsor accepted that
    registratation and payment did not crystallise until 09 July 2012.   As
    a matter of law, applications of this kind are not valid until  payment
    of  the  requisite  fee:  see  Kaur  [2013]  UKUT  00381  (IAC),   [40]
    especially, Article 3 of the Immigration and Nationality  (Fees)  Order
    2011 and Regulation  37  of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  (Fees)
    Regulations 2011.

 3. Given the  uncontested  fact  recorded  above,  the  applications  were
    governed by the new provisions of the  Rules  operative  from  09  July
    2012. It follows that the arguable error of law canvassed in the  grant
    of permission to appeal has no substance.  The Judge did not err in his
    selection of the provisions of the Rules  governing  the  applications.
    Thus the only ground on which permission to  appeal  was  granted  must
    fail.

 4. In passing, the sponsor did not challenge the findings of both the  ECO
    and the FtT that his income was insufficient  to  satisfy  the  revised
    provisions of the Rules, which stipulate a gross income of ï¿½22,400  per
    annum.  Nor was there any challenge to the  Judge's  finding  that  the
    applications had failed to provide the documents required by the Rules.
     The further finding - upholding the ECO - that there was no subsisting
    relationship between the first Appellant and the sponsor does not arise
    for consideration as it does not feature in the grant of permission  to
    appeal.
DECISION

 5.  For  the  reasons  elaborated  above,  these  conjoined  appeals   are
    dismissed.
