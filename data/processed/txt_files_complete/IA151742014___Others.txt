                                  EXTEMPORE
                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   Permission to appeal has been granted to appeal the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Raymond which  was  promulgated  on  24  June  2015
    following a hearing on 26 January  2015.   The  appellants  before  him
    numbered four.  The principle appellant was RD  and  three  individuals
    whom she states are her sons.

2.   The first difficulty in this appeal as it appears  before  me  is  that
    the only person who had a statutory appeal was RD.  The appellants,  OA
    and EA had failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that they were
    a  direct  relative  of  the  primary  carer  of  a  British   citizen,
    specifically original birth certificates showing the relationship link.
     As such they had no right  of  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to grant a derivative residence card.

3.   The purported appeal and the purported conclusion by Judge  Raymond  is
    thus a nullity.

4.   Insofar as the other child is concerned, ND, he also had  no  right  of
    appeal. He had not  provided  a  valid  passport  as  evidence  of  his
    identity and nationality and therefore he had no right of appeal  under
    the EEA Regulations. Therefore the only person  whose  decision  should
    have been considered by Judge Raymond was that of RD.

5.   RD was refused a derivative residence  card  in  a  decision  dated  13
    February 2014 for reasons set out in a letter dated the same day.   The
    only decision subject of appeal is the refusal to  issue  a  derivative
    residence card.   There  was  no  application  made  and  therefore  no
    decision made under the Immigration Rules  or  on  Article  8  grounds.
    Insofar as the judge attempted or purported  to  reach  a  decision  on
    Article 8 or under the Rules that again is a matter over which  he  had
    no jurisdiction.

6.   One of  the  difficulties  that  has  arisen  in  connection  with  the
    decision by Judge Raymond is  first  of  all  he  seems  to  have  been
    completely sidetracked by the family  set  up  and  his  views  on  the
    evidence and the illegal entry of some of these individuals to the  UK.
    His decision was promulgated some six months after he  heard  evidence.
    He takes note of the change in birth certificate as to who  the  father
    of the first appellant's British citizen child is and one of the  other
    children.  He raises questions as to whether another man, Mr O  is  the
    father of the British citizen child and the other child.

7.   He fails to make findings as to whether  RD  is  in  fact  the  primary
    carer although he refers to evidence before  him  that  the  two  other
    adults appear to be playing a significant role in the upbringing of the
    British citizen child.  He draws  attention  to  the  discrepancies  in
    terms of her claimed and evidenced income and her claims that  she  has
    paid something in the region of at least ï¿½12,000 a year  in  university
    fees for two older purported children.

8.   Although there is evidence that the person who  was  originally  listed
    on the British citizen child's birth certificate as his father has been
    either deported or removed from the UK, there appears to be no evidence
    as to who the child's father actually is or where he  is  or  what  has
    happened to him.

9.   The decision by the judge is also unfortunate in the  extent  to  which
    he appears to have taken against the family to a large  extent  because
    of  their  immigration  history.   He  makes  comments  about  "cynical
    manipulation" of their  right  to  an  identity  and  to  the  "cynical
    exploitation" of the two youngest children by RD.  He  talks  of  smoke
    and mirrors in terms of the evidence and he says  that  she  has  shown
    scant regard for the children's welfare.

10.  It is possible that his comments as to welfare stem from his view  that
    she abandoned the two older claimed children and it appears  that  this
    may well have infected his findings, such as they  are,  in  connection
    with whether or not RD is in  fact  the  primary  carer  of  a  British
    citizen child.  It is unfortunate that the judge has made  findings  in
    connection  with  the  two  adult   claimed   children.   It   appears,
    particularly given the length  of  time  that  it  took  the  judge  to
    promulgate his decision, that may well have infected his findings.   It
    certainly appears to have prevented him from seeing that three  of  the
    appellants that are listed on the decision did not in fact have a right
    of appeal.  It is not clear what assistance  he  was  given  by  either
    representative before the First-tier Tribunal.

11.  In summary the judge has failed to address the relevant  appeal  before
    him and make relevant, as oppose to irrelevant, findings of fact.

11.  I find an error of law in  the  decision  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge in his conclusions that the first appellant, RD did  not  succeed
    in her appeal against the refusal to issue a derivative residence card.
     I quash the decision insofar as Article 8 and the Rules is  concerned,
    the judge having no jurisdiction to reach that decision and I quash the
    decisions of the other three named  appellants,  the  judge  having  no
    jurisdiction to hear those appeals.

Notice of Decision

12.  I send the appeal of RD against the decision to  refuse  to  issue  her
    with a derivative residence card back to the First-tier Tribunal for  a
    First-tier Tribunal Judge other than Judge Raymond to reach a decision.
     Of course the purported appeals of OA, ND  and  EA  are  not  remitted
    because there is no appeal to remit.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
