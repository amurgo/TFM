                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

For the Appellant:     Mr S Kandola (Home Office Senior Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms F Shaw (counsel for Fisher Jones Greenwood)

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 8 January  2018  allowing  the  appeal  of
       Bahar Idriss, a citizen of Sudan born 18 June  2000,  itself  brought
       against the refusal of 1 November 2017 of his asylum claim.


    2. The Respondent's asylum application was based  on  being  a  non-Arab
       Darfuri of the Bargo Silihab tribe. He was born in Tawila, Darfur, on
       18 June 2000. He had one younger brother. He did  not  attend  school
       and was illiterate. His father had a farm and BI helped him  to  look
       after the livestock. In 2004 Tawila was razed by the  Janjaweed,  and
       many people were killed, including BI's mother.

    3. When he was aged 13, the  Janjaweed  came  to  the  family  farm  and
       accused him of working with the rebel Justice and  Equality  Movement
       (JEM). He was kidnapped and held for ten days. He was blindfolded and
       taken to an isolated forest, beaten and  interrogated.  He  possessed
       scars from being cut with a knife over this period. He  was  released
       but told he had to provide information about the JEM. He promised  to
       do so to secure his freedom. He walked back to his  family  home  and
       told his father what had happened.  He  was  taken  to  his  maternal
       aunt's house in Kanjara. The Janjaweed continued to visit his  family
       home to look for him. He remained at his aunt's house for some  seven
       months until arrangements were in place for his departure.

    4. The last time he saw his father and brother was in January  2015,  in
       Darfur.

    5. His asylum claim was refused by the Home Office  because  whilst  his
       nationality, ethnicity and identity were accepted as established, his
       account  of  kidnapping  by  the  Janjaweed  was  considered  to   be
       inconsistent, implausible and unsubstantiated.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal heard oral evidence and  directed  itself  to
       the  relevance  of  the  Presidential  Guidance  note  on  Vulnerable
       Witnesses. The  Judge  found  that  it  was  not  credible  that  the
       Appellant would have encountered  the  Janjaweed  on  only  a  single
       occasion, nor that he would have been able to  successfully  navigate
       back home from an  unknown  location  to  where  he  had  been  taken
       blindfolded, nor that he would have been released only to be  pursued
       by them almost immediately, nor that he would have been able to  live
       safely at his aunt's home for an extended period if it was only three
       kilometres from  the  family  home,  given  the  close  interest  the
       Janjaweed ostensibly showed in him over this period.

    7. The Judge noted the expert's opinion which suggested that the use  of
       child soldiers by the security forces continued to blight Sudan,  and
       thus inferred that another reason for  disbelieving  the  Appellant's
       claim was that  the  Janjaweed  would  have  sought  to  recruit  the
       Appellant had they found him alone in the forest rather  than  merely
       accusing him of working for JEM. However, the same thinking  did  not
       apply to the possibility of forced recruitment by JEM themselves,  as
       the country evidence supplied by the  Secretary  of  State  indicated
       that JEM no longer used child soldiers.

    8. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the rejection of these aspects  of  his
       account, the Appellant had  established  his  ethnicity  and  so  his
       appeal fell to be determined by reference to his racial origin. In MM
       (Darfuris) Sudan (CG) [2015] UKUT 10 (IAC) (5 January 2015) the Upper
       Tribunal had relied on the UKBA Operational Guidance  Note  (OGN)  on
       Sudan of 2 November 2009 at 3.8.19 stating that:

           "Conclusion.  All non-Arab Darfuris, regardless of their
           political or other affiliations, are at real risk of persecution
           in Darfur and internal relocation elsewhere in Sudan is not
           currently to be relied upon.  Claimants who establish that they
           are non-Arab Darfuris and who do not fall within the exclusion
           clauses will therefore qualify for asylum."

    9. In MM Sudan the evidence of  Peter  Verney  was  summarised  to  this
       effect, and accepted:


           "(i) The Sudanese authorities would treat the appellant as a non-
           Arab Darfuri.  What would matter to them was that he was a
           member of a non-Arab tribe who originate from Darfur.  It would
           make no difference to them that his father had moved away from
           Darfur and that he himself had neither been born nor ever lived
           in Darfur.
           (ii) Since the Tribunal case of AA there had been no improvement
           in the attitude of the Sudanese authorities to non-Arab Darfuris
           and indeed for members of the Berti tribe things were now worse,
           as a significant number of members of that tribe were educated
           and educated Darfuris were now being increasingly targeted by
           the security forces on suspicion that they were assisting the
           rebel forces.
           (iii) (This like (iv) below) were matters which arose from his
           oral evidence).  Even though there was evidence that a
           significant number of educated Berti lived in Khartoum and were
           able to go about their business without significant problems,
           they were increasingly at risk of becoming a target for adverse
           treatment.
           (iv) On return the authorities would view the appellant not just
           as a non-Arab Darfuri/Berti, but as someone who had lived in the
           UK and had claimed asylum there.  They would know from his
           passport that his exit visa had expired. This would add to the
           risk he would face on return."


   10. Having regard to that evidence, in MM Sudan the UT decided  that  the
       conclusion of the Tribunal in AA Sudan CG [2009]  UKAIT  00056  still
       held good: thus "All non-Arab Darfuris are at risk of persecution  in
       Darfur and cannot reasonably be expected  to  relocate  elsewhere  in
       Sudan." Applying these Country Guidelines,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       allowed BI's appeal: he was a non-Arab Darfuri  and  thus  could  not
       reasonably be expected to relocate. The  Judge  considered  that  the
       Secretary of State had been wrong to argue that a country report from
       the Danish Immigration Service could outweigh  a  Country  Guidelines
       decision.


   11. The Secretary of State appealed on the basis  that  his  view  as  to
       risks in Sudan had been reviewed in the latest CPIN  and  it  was  no
       longer accepted that the situation for non-Arab Darfuris placed  them
       at general risk of persecution: the First-tier Tribunal had failed to
       give adequate reasons for his conclusions, and misdirected himself in
       the consideration of the background evidence.  The  country  evidence
       now showed that  Khartoum's  population  included  around  a  million
       Darfuris many of whom have positions in government and academia.

   12. The First-tier Tribunal refused permission to appeal  on  30  January
       2018; however Judge Kekic granted permission to appeal on 2 May  2018
       on the basis that there was an arguable error in the treatment of the
       Secretary of State's case as to improvements in Khartoum. It was also
       arguable  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  properly  consider   the
       fabrication of aspects of his claim when assessing credibility.

   13. Before me Ms Shaw explained that the Presenting Officer below had not
       raised any challenge to  the  Country  Guidelines  in  MM  Sudan.  Mr
       Kandola  acknowledged  this  and  to  his  credit   recognised   that
       inappropriate assertions had been made  in  the  grounds  of  appeal.
       Whilst the Joint report of the Danish Immigration Service and UK Home
       Office  fact  finding  missions  to  Khartoum,  Kampala  and  Nairobi
       (conducted February - March 2016)  had  been  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, no formal challenge had been made to the prevailing Country
       Guidelines decision.

Findings and reasons

   14. Given the appropriately pragmatic stance adopted by Mr Kandola, I can
       deal with the appeal shortly.


   15. Stanley Burnton LJ in SG (Iraq) [2012] EWCA Civ 940 ï¿½47  stated  that
       "decision makers and tribunal judges are  required  to  take  Country
       Guidance determinations into account, and to follow them unless  very
       strong grounds supported by cogent evidence, are  adduced  justifying
       their not doing so." So any representative seeking departure  from  a
       relevant Country Guidelines decision must  identify  cogent  evidence
       that establishes very strong grounds justifying a change of stance.

   16. The Secretary of State's Country Policy and Information Note - Sudan:
       Non Arab Darfuris (August  2017)  cited  in  the  grounds  of  appeal
       states:

           "3.1.2 Existing caselaw has found that non-Arab Darfuris as an
           ethnic group are at risk of persecution in Darfur and cannot
           reasonably be expected to relocate elsewhere in Sudan, including
           to Khartoum.
           3.1.3 The Home Office view is, however, that there is cogent
           evidence indicating that non-Arab Darfuris are not generally at
           risk of persecution or serious harm solely on the grounds of
           their ethnicity in Khartoum. This evidence provides strong
           grounds to depart from the existing caselaw of AA and MM.
           3.1.4 Rather, a person's non-Arab Darfuri ethnicity is likely to
           be a factor which may bring them to the attention of the state
           and, depending on other aspects of their profile and activities,
           may lead to a risk of serious harm or persecution in Khartoum.
           3.1.5 Darfuris in Khartoum face discrimination in accessing
           public services, ducation and employment, experience forced
           eviction, societal harassment from other Sudanese, and do not
           have access to humanitarian assistance. However in general such
           treatment is not so severe that it is likely to amount to
           persecution but each case will need to be considered on its
           individual facts."

   17. It is clear that there was no submission put to the Judge below  that
       this material constituted  cogent  reasons  for  departing  from  the
       governing Country Guidelines. Furthermore, the CPIN that  was  relied
       on as the theoretical basis for any  such  submission  was  not  even
       placed before the Judge below. Thus the threshold for departing  from
       established Country Guidelines was not reached.


   18. As an aside, I note that given that BI was a minor at the date of the
       hearing below, one might well imagine that he would have been able to
       demonstrate  that  an  internal  relocation  alternative  that  would
       require him to face discrimination,  eviction  and  harassment  might
       well have been unduly harsh in any event. However it  is  unnecessary
       to consider that possibility, given that  the  Secretary  of  State's
       grounds of appeal against the decision allowing his appeal  based  on
       bare MM (Sudan) considerations are without foundation.


   19. Grounds of appeal which suggest that an  approach  was  taken  by  an
       advocate below without checking that this was truly the case  are  to
       be deprecated. Here the Upper Tribunal was  effectively  misled  into
       granting permission to appeal when the argument contended for had not
       in truth been advanced below.

   20. There was no material error of law in the decision of the  First-tier
       Tribunal.

Decision:

    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


Signed:                                            Date: 13 August 2018
