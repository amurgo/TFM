                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Gaisford, Counsel; Sriharans Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge O'Garro dismissing the Appellants' appeals  against
    the Respondent's decision refusing to grant asylum and to  remove  them
    by way of directions pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. Although the appeal is jointly brought, I shall refer to the  principle
    Appellant and refer to the Appellants in the singular form.

 3. The Appellant appealed against the decision of Judge  O'Garro  and  was
    granted permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Landes.  The
    grounds upon which permission was granted may be summarised as follows:

      i) It is arguable that the judge erred in failing to consider that the
         Appellant would be forced to conceal his religious identity  as  an
         evangelical Christian priest (as accepted by the Respondent in  her
         Refusal Letter) in order  to  avoid  persecution,  contrary  to  HJ
         (Iran) and  HT  (Cameroon)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2010] UKSC 31,

     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred in failing to  acknowledge  the
         risk which the Appellant was exposed to by distributing evangelical
         materials in Pakistan and that the finding that the Appellant would
         have mitigated the risk had  he  taken  the  books  to  the  Church
         library rather than his home was irrational,

    iii) It is arguable that  the  judge  erred  in  failing  to  apply  the
         relevant Country Guidance of AK and SK (Christians: risk)  Pakistan
         CG [2014] UKUT 00569 (IAC),

     iv) It is arguable that the judge erred in relying on matters  not  put
         to the Appellant and erring in relation  to  the  consideration  of
         documentary evidence,

      v) It is arguable that the judge erred in failing to consider the best
         interests of the third and fourth Appellant children.

 4. I was provided with copies of HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon)  v  Secretary
    of State for  the  Home  Department  [2010]  UKSC  31  and  AK  and  SK
    (Christians: risk) Pakistan CG [2014] UKUT 00569 (IAC) by the parties.

    Error of Law

 5. At the close of submissions,  I  indicated  that  I  would  reserve  my
    decision, which I shall now give. I find that there was an error of law
    in the decision such that it should be set aside.  My  reasons  for  so
    finding are as follows.

 6. In relation to the first ground, it is plain that the judge did err  in
    failing to consider that the Appellant would be forced to  conceal  his
    religious identity as an evangelical Christian priest and taught  at  a
    Christian school. It was accepted that the Appellant and his family are
    evangelical Christians. It  was  also  accepted  that  he  assisted  in
    transporting evangelical books around Pakistan  to  other  pastors  and
    evangelists (see paragraph 38 of the Refusal  Letter).  Although  these
    facts were acknowledged by the judge, �43 of the determination  reveals
    too literal an interpretation and application of the third headnote  of
    AK and SK. The third headnote states as follows:

         "Evangelism  by  its  very  nature  involves  some  obligation   to
         proselytise.  Someone  who  seeks  to  broadcast  their  faith   to
         strangers so as to encourage them to convert, may  find  themselves
         facing a charge of blasphemy. In that way,  evangelical  Christians
         face a greater risk than those  Christians  who  are  not  publicly
         active. It will be for the judicial fact-finder to assess on a case
         by case basis whether, notwithstanding attendance at an evangelical
         church, it is important to the individual to behave in  evangelical
         ways that may lead to a real risk of persecution"

 7.  The  judge's  determination  records  that  the   Appellant   is   not
    broadcasting his faith to strangers. Following that  reference  at  �43
    there is no mention thereafter of the risk that may  emanate  from  the
    Appellant's evangelism, solely a consideration  of  the  25  July  2014
    incident. However, this is a matter that requires  disposal  given  the
    Upper Tribunal stated as follows in AK and SK at [223]:

         "We  have  not  drawn  a  distinction  between   evangelising   and
         proselytising or preaching, following the approach  in  SZ  and  JM
         (Christians - FS confirmed) Iran CG [2008] UKAIT 00082. We consider
         that no useful purpose would  be  served  and  that  in  any  event
         Muslims would  not  see  any  difference  between  these  different
         activities."

 8. The judge is aware that the  Appellant  has  lived  in  Pakistan  as  a
    Christian "save for some element of discrimination" (see  �42)  however
    that is in my view insufficient cumulative consideration of the risk he
    may face  on  return,  particularly  in  light  of  HJ  (Iran)  and  HT
    (Cameroon) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] UKSC 31.
    The judge notes herself at �49 that as the only Christian family in the
    area, the Appellant would need to exercise "utmost caution". Does  that
    form of lifestyle form the basis of something reasonably  tolerable  to
    an evangelist? Even if it is contended  that  the  Appellant  may  live
    discreetly upon return, as he may have already done in  the  past,  the
    point  is  does  this  discreet  self-censorship  form   a   basis   of
    persecution? There are no  findings  on  this  crucial  issue.  Further
    still, there is no assessment of the Appellant's wish to evangelise. Mr
    Gaisford submitted it was not disputed that the Appellant continues  to
    practice his faith in the UK and  remains  evangelical  here.  In  that
    light, [80] of Lord Rogers' judgment is of relevance by analogy:

         "Another way of pointing to essentially the same  basic  defect  in
         the approach of the Court of Appeal is to say that a  tribunal  has
         no legitimate way of deciding whether an applicant could reasonably
         be expected  to  tolerate  living  discreetly  and  concealing  his
         homosexuality indefinitely for fear of persecution. Where would the
         tribunal find the yardstick to measure the level of suffering which
         a gay man -  far  less,  the  particular  applicant  -  would  find
         reasonably tolerable? How would the tribunal measure the equivalent
         level for a straight man asked  to  suppress  his  sexual  identity
         indefinitely? The answer  surely  is  that  there  is  no  relevant
         standard since it is something which no one should have to  endure.
         In practice, of course, where the evidence showed that an applicant
         had avoided persecutory harm by living discreetly for a  number  of
         years before leaving  his  home  country,  the  tribunal  would  be
         tempted to fall into error. The tribunal would be  liable  to  hold
         that the evidence showed that this applicant, at least,  must  have
         found his predicament reasonably tolerable in the  past  -  and  so
         would find it reasonably tolerable  if  he  were  returned  to  his
         country of nationality. But, in truth, that evidence  would  merely
         show that the applicant had put up with living discreetly for  fear
         of the potentially dire consequences of living openly."

 9. For my part, what also troubled me was that  there  was  no  particular
    evidence, either way, as  to  how  the  Appellant  would  practice  his
    religious beliefs and in what way he would evangelise  upon  return  to
    Pakistan and  whether  he  would  continue  to  distribute  evangelical
    materials to other pastors and preachers around Pakistan. Consequently,
    there cannot have been any assessment of that element of risk  that  he
    may face. This is obviously a point that  needs  to  be  considered  in
    order that the Appellant's appeal fully ventilate all issues of risk on
    return. I do not accept that this is a matter for a 'fresh claim' as Mr
    Clarke suggested. The Tribunal  is  required  to  administrate  justice
    efficiently and expeditiously. Fresh claims are for fresh  evidence  or
    changes in circumstance, not for consideration of old material that the
    parties overlooked. At any rate, even  if  the  judge  disbelieved  the
    incident of 25 July 2014 occurred, the fact remains that the  Appellant
    is an evangelical  pastor  and  the  risk  of  his  discovery  and  the
    consequences that may result need to be examined. In light  of  all  of
    the above, I find that ground 1 is made out.

10. In relation to ground 3, although there is a great deal of overlap with
    ground 1, I find that this ground is also made  out,  given  the  above
    discussion, and as the judge's findings fail to assess the future  risk
    that the Appellant may face, and broadly conflict with [242] of AK  and
    SK and which states as follows:

         "... It will be for the judicial fact-finder to assess on a case by
         case basis whether, notwithstanding attendance  at  an  evangelical
         church, it is important to the individual to behave in  evangelical
         ways that may lead to a real risk of persecution."

11. In relation to ground 2, although there is some overlap, concerning the
    allegation of perversity in relation to the finding that the  Appellant
    would have mitigated the risk had he taken  the  books  to  the  Church
    library rather than his home, I find this ground is made  out  also.  I
    confess I cannot see the distinction between being caught  transporting
    evangelical material to one's home or a Church library. The destination
    is  irrelevant.  It  is  the  level  of  perceived  blasphemy  of   the
    evangelising material by the Muslim majority  that  is  important.  The
    Appellant's evidence is that the materials were placed in  the  library
    when his evangelism was discovered. It is difficult to distinguish  the
    importance of not storing the materials in the Church library when  the
    material itself is not inherent to practicing  as  a  Christian,  which
    according to the objective evidence is generally tolerated, as  opposed
    to evangelism  and  proselytisation,  which  is  not.  Given  that  the
    transportation of the materials had been accepted, it  is  perverse  to
    find that the claim is not credible for the reason  of  the  choice  of
    storage location of the materials.

12. In light of my findings on grounds 1-3, I do not  propose  to  consider
    the remaining two grounds. I set aside the decision and findings of the
    judge in their entirety.




    Decision

13. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal,  to  be  heard  by  a  differently
    constituted bench.
