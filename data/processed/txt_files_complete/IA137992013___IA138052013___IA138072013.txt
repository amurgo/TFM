For the Appellant:     Mr Youssefian of DJ Webb & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are citizens of the Cote d'Ivoire born on 13th  December
    1977, 4th January 1975 and  19th  May  2009  respectively.   The  first
    Appellant arrived in the UK with leave to enter as  a  student  with  a
    visa  valid  from  30th  March  2004  to  31st  January  2005  and  was
    subsequently granted successive periods of leave  until  28th  February
    2013. The second and third Appellants had leave in line.

 2. On 22nd February 2013 she made a  combined  application  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system and for a biometric residence permit.

 3. Paragraph 245ZH(ha) provides that if a course is at a degree  level  or
    above the grant of leave to remain that the Appellant is  seeking  must
    not lead to her having spent more than five years in the UK as a Tier 4
    (General) Student Migrant or as a student studying  courses  at  degree
    level or above unless certain  exceptions  apply,  none  of  which  are
    relevant to the Appellant.

 4. The judge wrote as follows:

         "Degree level is NQF  Level 6. The Appellant has applied  to  do  a
         CIMA course which is at level NQF  Level 7 and  of  twelve  months'
         duration.  The Respondent has listed the other relevant courses  as
         a BA Hons in business management   from  September  2004  to  April
         l2007, a Master of Business Administration 31.8.2010 to 31.10.2012.
          The total length is 57 months.  If the above courses  are  all  at
         degree level or above, the CIMA course which is one year in  length
         will take the length of studies over five years (60  months).   The
         Appellant argues that her BA was a top-up to her HND and  that  the
         HND was below  NQF   Level  6  and  should  not  be  counted.   The
         Respondent's case is that the HND is part of the degree course  and
         is counted.

         The normal length of a Bachelors degree is three years. By doing an
         HND the Appellant was able to complete her degree by just  studying
         for an additional one year.  I find that the HND was  part  of  the
         degree and the length of the total studies HND  and  degree  top-up
         course should be counted. It would not  be  logical  or  fair  that
         someone who went through the HND and top-up route to a degree would
         be able to study for a longer period in the UK than someone who had
         just studied for a degree when the length of studies were the  same
         length."

 5. On that basis she dismissed the appeal.

 6. The Appellant appealed against that decision and permission  to  appeal
    was initially refused by Judge Ford on 6th November 2013.  Upon renewal
    to the Upper Tribunal it was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Warr  on
    5th December 2013.



The Hearing

 7. At the hearing Mr Duffy said that he had been able to take instructions
    and he agreed that the challenge to  the  decision  was  correct.   The
    Respondent accepted that the HND course  was  below  degree  level  and
    accordingly the judge was in error.  The decision should be  set  aside
    and remade.

 8. He said that the Respondent no longer relied upon the original  refusal
    but raised the question as to whether the Appellant might fall foul  of
    Rule 245ZX(h) which states that, if the course is below  degree  level,
    the grant of leave to remain the applicant is seeking must not lead  to
    the applicant having spent more than three years in the UK as a Tier  4
    Migrant.   However, on reflection he accepted  the  point  made  by  Mr
    Youssefian that 245ZX(h) idoes not apply because the  course  that  the
    Appellant is intending to study is above and not below degree level.

Decision

 9. The original judge erred in law.  Her decision  is  set  aside  and  is
    remade as follows.  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.
