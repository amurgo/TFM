For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the 'respondent' and  the  respondent
    as the 'appellant', as they appeared respectively before the First-tier
    Tribunal. The appellant was born on 28 June 1989 and is a male  citizen
    of Zimbabwe. The appellant claims arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    2002/2003. Whilst living here, he has been convicted on seven occasions
    for a total of 29 offences committed between June 2007 and  June  2015.
    The  convictions  include  several  for  drug-related  offences.  By  a
    decision dated 25 September 2015, the Secretary  of  State  decided  to
    deport the appellant to Zimbabwe. By letter dated 29 October 2018,  the
    appellant provided reasons why  he  wished  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on human rights grounds. He has a partner [A] with whom he  has
    two children who were born in 2014 and 2017 respectively. He lives with
    his partner and children. By a decision dated  22  November  2018,  the
    Secretary of State refused the  appellant's  human  rights  claim.  The
    appellant appealed against that decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which, in a decision promulgated on 29 March 2019, allowed the  appeal.
    The Secretary of State  no  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. Throughout these proceedings, the appellant has not been represented by
    solicitors. He and his partner attended before the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    person at the initial hearing. I was careful to explain the  procedures
    of the tribunal to the appellant and to ensure that he understood them.
    I explained the nature of the legal test relevant in his case  and  the
    reasons why the Secretary of State argued that the judge had  erred  in
    law. I was satisfied that the appellant understood the proceedings.

 3. Before the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant argued that it  would  be
    unduly harsh for him to be deported whilst his partner and the children
    remained in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State agrees  that  it
    would be unduly harsh to expect  partner  and  children  to  travel  to
    Zimbabwe with the appellant.  The  partner  and  children  are  British
    citizens.

 4. The appellant's appeal falls to be considered under section 117C of the
    2002 Act:

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.

 5. The same test of undue hardship also arises under paragraph 399a of  HC
    395 (as amended). If the deportation of the appellant  would  not  have
    unduly harsh consequences for either the  appellant's  partner  or  the
    children, his appeal will fail.

 6. At [12], the judge also proceeded to consider Article 8. However, there
    is nothing in the facts of this appeal which would  indicate  that  the
    appellant might succeed on human rights grounds in the event that he is
    unable  to  show  that  his  deportation  would   have   unduly   harsh
    consequences for his family members.

 7. The decision of the judge is problematic. In  parts,  it  is  not  very
    clearly expressed. The main analysis  appears  at  [10-11].  The  judge
    noted that the respondent did not  accept  that  the  appellant  had  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with  his  children.  The
    judge rejected that submission and it is  clear  from  the  grounds  of
    appeal that the Secretary of State now accepts that such  relationships
    do  exist.  The  judge  went  on  to  consider  the  strength  of   the
    relationships noting that the appellant and  his  partner  had  met  at
    school, that the appellant had become integrated in the United  Kingdom
    having been educated here and observing that  the  appellant's  partner
    had not considered that any problem would arise  over  the  appellant's
    immigration status.

 8. It is at this point in the analysis that the reasoning becomes obscure.
    The  judge  wrote  that,  'I  found  that  a  genuine  and   subsisting
    relationship exists between the appellant  and  his  children  for  the
    reasons which I have given. In view of the fact that this is  the  only
    basis put forward by the respondent for not accepting that it would  be
    unduly harsh  for  the  children  to  remain  in  the  UK  without  the
    appellant, I find it would be unduly harsh for the children  to  remain
    in the UK if the appellant was to be deported.' [10]. It  is  the  case
    that the refusal letter at [29] states that, 'as  it  is  not  accepted
    that you have a genuine and subsisting relationship with [A] it is  not
    accepted it would be unduly harsh for her to remain UK even though  you
    are to be deported.' However, the judge's reasoning is,  with  respect,
    disingenuous. Having found that there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship, the judge was  still  required  to  apply  the  statutory
    provisions to the facts as he found them, that is he  was  required  to
    determine whether or not the deportation of the  appellant  would  have
    unduly harsh consequences for the partner  and  children.  Further,  at
    [11], the judge states that he has 'explained why it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for the children to remain in  the  UK  without  the  appellant';
    other than the inadequate argument which I have  identified  above,  he
    has provided no reasons whatever the so concluding.  The  remainder  of
    the decision, which goes  on  to  deal  with  Article  8,  consists  of
    reiterations of the  judge's  conclusion  as  to  the  consequences  of
    deportation; no attempt is made to provide reasons for the decision.

 9. It is important that a  decision  should  be  written  with  sufficient
    clarity to enable the losing party fully to understand why  he/she  has
    lost. That is not the case with this decision. Moreover, if  the  judge
    believed that he did not need to go beyond  making  a  finding  that  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship existed between the  appellant  and
    his family members, then he has erred in law by failing  to  apply  the
    statutory test of undue harshness to the facts as he found them. He was
    required to apply that test irrespective of the reasons  given  by  the
    Secretary of State for refusing the appellant's human rights claim.

10. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  I  have
    proceeded to remake the decision. I asked the appellant to address  me.
    He said that he feared deportation to Zimbabwe because of the effect it
    would have upon his relationship with the family. He drew attention, in
    particular, to the difficulty of keeping in touch with the family  from
    such a distance and whilst he was  living  in  a  society  where  using
    modern means of communication might prove difficult.

11. I have considered also the evidence which  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  including  the  letter  written  by  the  appellant  to   the
    respondent indicating why he believed he should remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom with his family. As the First-tier Tribunal had  observed,  the
    family  had  run  into  problems  whilst  the  appellant  had  been  in
    detention. The judge noted that the appellant's partner had encountered
    severe financial difficulties when the appellant was in prison, running
    up debts of approximately �3000 and a substantial risk of being evicted
    [10]. The appellant's partner  works  and  pays  the  rent  whilst  the
    appellant provides childcare.

12. It is significant that, beyond a fear of falling into further financial
    difficulties and being unable to maintain  contact  from  Zimbabwe,  no
    other evidence has been put forward to indicate why may be unduly harsh
    for the children and the partner to be separated  by  deportation  from
    the appellant. It is clear that the test of undue hardship is a  severe
    one (see KO (Nigeria) 2018 UKSC 53); any deportation is likely to cause
    hardship, both on a practical basis and by way  of  emotional  distress
    for partners and, particularly, children who have to face the  prospect
    of a lengthy and possibly  permanent  separation  from  a  parent.  The
    appellant has  been  given  every  opportunity  to  advance  his  case.
    However, I do not find that even  the  prospect  of  further  financial
    difficulties for the family which may arise if A, for example,  has  to
    give up work in order to  look  after  the  children  can  properly  be
    described as an unduly harsh consequence  of  appellant's  deportation.
    The same is also true of possible future difficulties in communication;
    such  difficulties  are  likely  to  arise  in  almost  every  case  of
    deportation. I fully accept, as did the First-tier Tribunal, that  this
    appellant  enjoys  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  his
    children and partner but, as I explained the  appellant,  that  is  not
    enough to establish undue harshness. I find, therefore, on the basis of
    the evidence before me, that the appellant has failed to establish  the
    consequences of his deportation would be unduly harsh  either  for  his
    partner, A, or for his two children. I therefore  remake  the  decision
    dismissing the appellant's appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    refusal of his human rights claim.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside.  I  have  remade  the
decision. The appellant's appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
State dated 22 November 2018 is dismissed.
