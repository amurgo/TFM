Representation:

For the Appellant:  in person
For the Respondent: Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant had appealed against the respondent's refusal  to  grant
      her a Certificate of Entitlement under Section 10 of the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which appeal was  refused  by  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Rowlands.

   2. DIJ McCarthy, when considering whether to grant permission to  appeal,
      refused permission on the merits, as it was clear that  the  appellant
      was not entitled to a Certificate of Entitlement because she could not
      show that either of her parents had been born in the UK.  However,  he
      noted that jurisdiction was also challenged, in his words, the grounds
      having contained "threatening remarks [which] are  offensive  and  are
      ignored", but which he considered might be arguable.

   3. The grounds of appeal to this Tribunal are not signed, and there is no
      solicitor or counsel on  the  record  as  acting  for  the  appellant.
      Furthermore, the appellant informed  the  Tribunal  that  she  had  no
      knowledge of what was in the grounds  and  had  no  input  into  their
      formulation.  The relevant part  of  the  grounds,  dealing  with  the
      jurisdiction point, is as follows:


      "Only  the  Higher  courts  have  jurisdiction  for  nationality   and
      citizenship, hence the reason the  IA  Judges  have  no  authority  to
      forced (sic) the Home office to act accordingly.


      We have been instructed by counsel that we should report the  breaches
      by the immigration Judge and the  representing  officer  in  the  said
      appeal.


      Misconduct and breaches of public office  is  a  serious  offence  and
      bears a penalty of life imprisonment


      We are contacting the relevant authorities for redress  for  the  said
      appeal to ensure that civil, criminal and  ECHR  laws  are  not  being
      violated by public officials".

   4. Just before the hearing, the appellant applied for an adjournment; her
      reasons for doing so were that the body to  whom  she  had  paid  some
      ï¿½2,600.00, known as "Commonwealth Evaluators" (the person dealing with
      her being one Swaye Binns) had taken  her  money  but  had  failed  to
      provide a barrister for her or even give her copies of documents which
      had been sent to the court.  I did not grant the adjournment  (because
      the appeal was hopeless in any event  for  the  reasons  which  appear
      below) but I am aware that "Commonwealth Evaluators" are known to this
      Tribunal, and that the offensive manner in which  these  grounds  have
      been settled is by no means unique.

   5. The website  of  this  organisation  states  that  they  are  offering
      "specialist services to commonwealth migrants", said to include "legal
      services", being "administrative support as [our clients] attain their
      right to abode in the United Kingdom".  It seems  clear  that  amongst
      these services has been the settling of grounds  of  appeal  and  they
      have also taken money for these services.  They are not solicitors and
      nor are they registered with the OISC.   It  would  appear  that  this
      organisation is an unregistered/unregulated firm offering  immigration
      advice.

   6. Having expressed my concern as to  this  possibility,  Mr  Duffy,  the
      Presenting Officer, handed me the note made by the HOPO at the  First-
      tier  Tribunal  proceedings,  from  which  it  is  clear   that   this
      organisation had had four appeals listed on the same day, in  each  of
      which the clients (which is what the appellants appeared to  be)  were
      represented by the same counsel, who was called in 2003.   The  HOPO's
      note contains the following:

   7. "Prior to the hearings commencing I said that I was a little surprised
      to see her as I had mentioned to her on 21 October 2016 (she  appeared
      in another Commonwealth Evaluators'  appeal  on  that  day  ...)  that
      Commonwealth Evaluators appeared as an  unregistered/unregulated  firm
      offering immigration advice.  She went away and on return said  to  me
      that she had been instructed by a McKenzie Friend who is  representing
      each of the [applicants] and that her clerks informed her that was  an
      acceptable arrangement".

   8. The HOPO was concerned about this explanation, as was I when  I  heard
      about it.

   9. I note also that despite the claim to having been advised  by  counsel
      "that we should report the breaches by the immigration Judge  and  the
      representing officer in  the  said  appeal",  unsurprisingly  no  such
      report has been received. Nor does it appear that any of the "relevant
      authorities" to whom the  alleged  irregularities  were  going  to  be
      reported have been contacted either.

  10. Notwithstanding Judge McCarthy's concerns,  I  am  entirely  satisfied
      that Judge Rowlands did in fact have  jurisdiction  to  entertain  the
      appeal, such that I indicated at the conclusion of  the  hearing  that
      the appeal would be dismissed; the appeal  itself  had  been  dated  9
      September 2014 and was stamped as received by  the  respondent  on  15
      January 2015, which was before the appeal  rights  changes  came  into
      effect in April 2015.  By  the  transitional  provisions,  apart  from
      protection claims or human rights claims  (which  this  was  not)  the
      Rules applicable would be those in force at the date  of  application,
      not the date of decision, and  as  at  the  date  of  application  the
      appellant had a right of appeal against the decision,  the  judge  had
      been right to accept jurisdiction.  (Even if the Tribunal  had  lacked
      jurisdiction, this would not have benefited the appellant because  the
      respondent's original decision would still have stood and so quite how
      those drafting the grounds  thought  that  the  absurd  and  offensive
      suggestion that the judge could be  liable  to  life  imprisonment  in
      respect of his decision could have been of any  practical  benefit  to
      the appellant is unclear).

  11. The reason why I did not merely dismiss the  appeal  in  an  extempore
      judgment immediately following the hearing was because I was concerned
      as to the conduct of the organisation to which the appellant had  paid
      money and also that of her barrister before the  First-tier  Tribunal.
      For this  reason  I  indicated  that  although  the  appeal  would  be
      dismissed, it was my provisional view that there should be  a  further
      hearing on 14 July when  the  conduct  of  those  concerned  could  be
      investigated.

  12. However, on further consideration I do not consider that a further
      hearing would be the appropriate way forward and accordingly give my
      decision now (the appellant having been notified that there would not
      now be a further hearing). It will be for others to consider whether
      the matters referred to above merit further investigation and if so,
      how this should best be achieved.

  13. For the purposes of this decision, it is sufficient if I record for
      the reasons given, this appeal is dismissed.




  14. Decision

      The appellant's appeal is dismissed. The decision of the First-tier
      Tribunal, dismissing the appellant's appeal, is affirmed.
