For the Respondent:    Mr M Saeed, instructed by Legal Solution Advocates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. In a determination promulgated on 3 December 2014 First-tier Tribunal
       Judge Oakley allowed the appeal of Mr Furqan  Kayani  (whom  we  call
       "the claimant" in this judgment) against a decision of the  Secretary
       of State for the Home Department ("the Secretary of State")  refusing
       his application to remain in the United Kingdom to operate a business
       under the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) system.  The Secretary of  State  has
       appealed to us against the judge's decision.

    2. The claimant is from Pakistan.  He entered the United  Kingdom  on  9
       April 2007 with entry clearance as a  student  valid  until  21  June
       2010.  On 18 June 2010 he was granted leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4
       (General) Student until 31 December 2011.  On 5 December 2011 he  was
       granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 5
       December 2013.  Meanwhile, on 22 November 2012, the claimant  made  a
       combined application for leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
       Migrant under the points system and for a biometric residence permit.
        He was interviewed on 24 April in Sheffield  regarding  his  Tier  1
       (Entrepreneur) application.  The following  month  the  Secretary  of
       State refused the application.

    3. The claimant applied for judicial  review  and  the  application  was
       compromised by the Secretary of  State  agreeing  to  reconsider  her
       decision.  On 24 October 2013  the  claimant  was  re-interviewed  at
       Sheffield regarding  his  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  application.   The
       interviewer concluded that the claimant was  credible  and  genuinely
       intended to establish a business in the United Kingdom and was  going
       to invest the money available to him in the business.   The  claimant
       had the requisite funds available and  did  not  intend  to  take  up
       employment other than as an entrepreneur.  The interviewer noted that
       funds were held in the account of the claimant's brother in  Pakistan
       at the time the initial application had been made, and the funds  had
       been transferred to the United Kingdom bank account belonging to  the
       claimant on 30 April 2013.  The interviewer recorded that he had seen
       the bank statements which were from  HBL  Bank,  London.   As  of  30
       September 2013 the claimant still had �51,488 in the account.

    4. As regards the viability and credibility of the  claimant's  business
       plan the  interviewer  referred  to  the  previous  assessment.   The
       interviewer then recorded that the claimant had studied  a  two  year
       diploma in IT at Brooks College  from  2007  to  2009  and  had  then
       studied an MBA in Banking Finance at Coventry  University.   He  "has
       two years' experience from back home working  in  software  house  in
       call centres, has a strong management  background  from  gaining  his
       MBA, has taken two years working on a business  plan  which  involves
       software and IT".   The  interviewer  noted  that  the  claimant  had
       already set up a business and was looking to  settle  in  the  United
       Kingdom permanently: "if any further documentation is required  could
       you please email the claimant on write2furqankayani@gmail.com."

    5. In late November and early  December  the  Secretary  of  State  sent
       emails to an email address furwankayani@gmail.com requiring a copy of
       his Companies House current appointment  report  and  copies  of  any
       advertising material.  The First-tier Tribunal  judge  accepted  that
       neither the claimant nor his representatives received that letter.

    6. In any event, the Secretary of State issued  a  second  decision,  in
       almost identical terms, in a letter dated 11  April  2014.   In  that
       letter the Secretary of State stated that she was not satisfied  that
       on the balance of probabilities the appellant genuinely  intended  to
       establish a business, to invest the requisite amount of money  or  to
       take employment in this country other than under  the  terms  of  the
       Immigration Rules.  The decision  letter  referred  to  a  number  of
       considerations.  We set them out at  some  length  because  of  their
       relevance to the appeal.  First, the letter set out the evidence  the
       claimant had submitted.  There was reference under that head  to  the
       failure to respond to the  email  request  we  have  mentioned.   The
       Secretary of State concluded under that heading that there were  high
       concerns regarding the evidence submitted.

    7. The decision letter turned to the viability and  credibility  of  the
       source of the funds.  Firstly, the letter considered,  in  particular
       how the funds had been  transferred  from  the  claimant's  brother's
       account in Pakistan to  accounts  in  this  country.   Secondly,  the
       letter said that there was a concern because of payments out, a  loan
       repayment for example,  and  two  large  payments  from  the  Halifax
       account to a Faraz Haider.  There was also  a  sum  of  over  �22,000
       which had been repaid to Telebridge Communications by way of software
       services.  Thirdly, the letter under this head raised  the  issue  of
       the investment of the �50,000 in  the  claimant's  business,  Softech
       Consultants Limited.  A passage from the interview  conducted  on  24
       October was set out where the claimant had said that  the  money  had
       not been invested at that stage because no visa had yet been granted.
        A further answer  from  the  claimant  was  quoted  in  relation  to
       advertising material.

    8. There was then reference to a transfer of funds to Barclays,  to  the
       company accounts and to employees.  The conclusion was that  although
       the evidence demonstrated that  the  finances  were  present  in  the
       claimant's  account  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not   adequately
       satisfied with the source of the funds.  It called into question  the
       genuine nature of the deposits and whether the  money  had  genuinely
       been invested in a business in the United Kingdom.

    9. Thirdly, the decision letter considered the viability and credibility
       of the claimant's business plans and  market  research.   There  were
       four concerns raised here.  The first concern in that regard was that
       Raja Zahid at  Education  Online  Limited  was  a  Tier  1  (General)
       Migrant.  There was also a concern that Education Online Limited  was
       registered at a residential address in Oldham.  The agreement between
       Education  Online  Limited  and  the   claimant's   company   Softech
       Consultants Limited had generated  certain  invoices.   The  invoices
       submitted raised concerns because the amount of work  undertaken  did
       not seem to justify the sums of money set out.   There  was  also  an
       ancillary concern that  the  Secretary  of  State,  having  conducted
       online research, could not find any reference to advertising material
       or a website for Education Online Limited.  The  fourth  concern  was
       that the agreement with Education Online Limited was for a period  of
       one year with a possible extension agreed by the  parties.   However,
       in the interview, the claimant had  not  made  any  reference  to  an
       extension or indicated that Education Online was content to carry  on
       trading with the claimant's company.

   10. The decision letter then referred to the claimant being the  director
       of various other companies which "does not suggest that you have been
       dedicating your time to marketing and planning  the  growth  of  your
       current business over the period  of  time  stated  by  you  at  your
       interview".  There was also a concern  about  accessing  the  website
       from the link which had been provided  to  the  claimant's  business.
       The conclusion under this head was that from  the  evidence  provided
       and the answers given at interview the Secretary  of  State  was  not
       satisfied with  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the  claimant's
       business plans and market research.

   11. The next head in  the  decision  letter  dealt  with  the  claimant's
       previous experience.  Under this head the Secretary of  State  raised
       her concern with a letter dated September 2007 coming from Telebridge
       Communications.  The decision letter noted that the claimant had been
       a director of a company called Telebridge Communications and that was
       also the name of his brother's business  in  Pakistan.   This  raised
       questions about credibility of the letter  and  of  any  actual  work
       experience undertaken by the claimant.  There was also an issue  that
       the claimant had stated at interview that he had  not  worked  during
       his student leave and had not  given  details  of  any  further  work
       experience.  The insurance policy taken out by the claimant  with  an
       insurance company named Catlin was also an issue since the  documents
       submitted did  not  contain  any  official  address  for  Catlin  and
       contained bad grammar.  The decision letter under the head 'Any other
       relevant information' stated that it "cast doubt over  the  [genesis]
       and credibility of your business Softech Consultants Limited  and  of
       the feasibility of any trading activities taking place".

   12. The claimant appealed.  The matter came  before  the  Tribunal.   The
       judge set out various findings  of  fact  reflected  earlier  in  our
       judgment.  The judge then said, at paragraph 30,  that  it  was  very
       significant that in the claimant's interview the interviewer  was  in
       all respects recommending the  claimant  as  credible  and  intending
       genuinely to establish a business in this country and also having the
       money genuinely to invest:

           "It would appear that the  Secretary  of  State  in  considering
           their   decision   has   totally   ignored   the   interviewer's
           recommendation  or  in  the  alternative  has  given  no  reason
           whatsoever in the letter of refusal as to why they have  ignored
           the  recommendations  and  the  remarks  in   the   Entrepreneur
           interview recommendation".

   13. The judge then considered four matters.  The first was the attempt by
       the Secretary of State's representative to obtain information from an
       entirely incorrect email address.   Secondly,  the  judge  notes  the
       concern about the origin of the funds.  Thirdly, he referred  to  the
       previous work experience letter from  Telebridge  Communications  and
       fourthly, the passage in the decision  letter  about  the  claimant's
       being the director of other companies.  The judge returned  again  to
       the Secretary of State rejecting her own interviewer's record and the
       interviewer's recommendation: "These have been singly ignored by  the
       Secretary of State and if they have not been ignored then no  reasons
       whatsoever have been given by the Secretary of State as to  why  they
       did not rely on the interviewer's recommendations..."

   14. The Secretary of State  now  quite  justifiably  contends  that  this
       judgment contains material errors of law.  Firstly, it is evident  to
       us that the judge has not considered in detail the reasons  given  by
       the Secretary  of  State  as  regards  the  funds  available  to  the
       claimant.  The concern raised in the decision letter did  not  simply
       focus on the origins of the funds but as we have  described,  various
       other aspects as well.  Secondly, the Secretary  of  State's  queries
       about the previous work experience letter are not  addressed  in  the
       judge's  reasons,  the  judge  simply  accepting   its   credibility.
       Thirdly, the viability and credibility issues raised in the  decision
       letter are not addressed at  all  except  for  the  point  about  the
       appellant being a director of other companies.  We cannot accept  the
       submissions made to us on the claimant's behalf this  morning  by  Mr
       Saeed that  this  determination  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  a
       thorough scrutiny of the Secretary of State's  consideration  in  the
       decision letter.  The decision letter canvassed many  issues,  as  we
       have described and it was an error for the judge to identify a couple
       and pick holes in them.

   15. Nor are we impressed by the  submissions  Mr  Saeed  made  about  the
       conduct of the Secretary of State.  Certainly this matter has dragged
       on for a number of years.  There was  the  earlier  refusal  and  the
       judicial review which led to the Secretary of State's reconsideration
       of the matter.  But that goes nowhere as a point of criticism of  the
       Tribunal's decision on this occasion.  There was the issue which  the
       judge raised about the emails  being  directed  to  the  wrong  email
       address but not to put a fine point on it  Mr  Saeed's  criticism  of
       that goes nowhere when the emails were simply requiring  a  Companies
       House current appointment report and copies of advertising  material.
       It is clear that the Secretary of State in the decision letter had  a
       wealth of material to consider, albeit those two emails  having  gone
       astray.  In our view the decision of the Tribunal is  inadequate  and
       we will allow the appeal.

   16. Mr Saeed raised various additional points about the  claimant  having
       been waiting for over three years and now having  daughters  and  the
       money still being in the account.   That  is  not  a  matter  we  can
       consider here.  As we have said, we allow the  Secretary  of  State's
       appeal.

   17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside  and  shall  be
       remade at the Hatton Cross hearing centre, before a judge other  than
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Oakley.
