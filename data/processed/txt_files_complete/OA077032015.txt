                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

Background

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sudan, born  on  21  March  1984.   In  a
    decision promulgated on 4 April 2016 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Flynn dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal
    to grant entry clearance as a partner under paragraph EC-P of  Appendix
    FM to HC 395 (as amended).  The judge, at [20] confirmed that the  sole
    reason for dismissal of the appeal was that the appellant had failed to
    show any  repayment  of  NHS  charges.   The  appellant  appealed  with
    permission.

 2. As correctly identified by Judge Flynn under S-EC.2.3 of  Appendix  FM,
    an application  will  normally  be  refused  where  the  applicant  has
    outstanding NHS charges exceeding  �1,000.   The  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter indicated that the appellant had unpaid  charges  of  more  than
    �5,000 according to NHS records which the respondent  indicated  showed
    that the appellant owed �5,034 to Imperial College Health Care NHS  for
    maternity costs.  The  respondent  therefore  refused  her  application
    under paragraph EC-P.1.1(c) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (S-
    EC.2.3).

 3. Mr Abdel Aziz, the sponsor and husband of the  appellant,  appealed  to
    the Upper Tribunal on the grounds that the NHS  charges  had  now  been
    paid and he attached a  receipt  that  they  were  fully  settled.  The
    charges were fully settled with St Mary's Hospital on 27 May 2015.  The
    sponsor attached the invoice from  the  hospital  and  the  receipt  of
    payment which included a reference for the payment.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the appellant's application  on  27
    March 2015.  Under Section 85A  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 the  material  time  for  the  judge  to  consider  the
    circumstances was 27 March 2015, the date of decision.  It was accepted
    before me that under the transitional provisions  which  apply  to  the
    Immigration Act 2014, namely Commencement Number  3  (Transitional  and
    Savings Provisions) Order 2014 as amended by the Immigration  Act  2014
    (Commencement  Number  4  Transitional  and  Savings   Provisions   and
    Amendment) Order 2015, Section 85A was still in force as at the date of
    decision.  Therefore the judge was only permitted to take into  account
    evidence of the circumstances appertaining at the date of decision.

 5. It was not disputed  before  me  that  at  the  date  of  decision  the
    appellant had not paid the NHS  charges.   Indeed  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in  relation  to  the  NHS  treatment
    charge it was indicated that the appellant had not been  aware  of  the
    Rules in relation to NHS treatment and that her husband  (the  sponsor)
    had subsequently contacted the hospital to arrange for the  payment  of
    the treatment received.  Although the grounds of appeal indicated  that
    a full payment of the charge  would  be  made  and  evidence  would  be
    submitted, the circumstances appertaining at the date of  decision  was
    that at that date it is not disputed no payment had been made.

 6. Although the judge granting permission to the Upper Tribunal noted that
    payment was made prior to the Entry Clearance Manager (ECM)  review  of
    the appellant's appeal (although this information does  not  appear  to
    have been before  the  ECM)  that  does  not  in  my  view  assist  the
    appellant.  There is no authority for the proposition that  an      ECM
    review means that the relevant date for the purpose of  Section  85A(2)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as it then was, was
    the date of the  review  by  the  ECM.   A  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance is a decision of the kind specified in Section  82(2)(b).   I
    am not persuaded that the "decision" referred to  in  the  phrase  "the
    circumstances appertaining as at the time of the decision"  in  Section
    85A(2) should be interpreted to include the decision of the ECM.

 7. The decision mentioned in this phrase is a reference to an "immigration
    decision"  mentioned  in  the  first  part  of   Section   85A(2)   and
    "immigration decision" is defined  in  Section  82(2)  as  including  a
    refusal of entry clearance.  There is  no  mention  of  the  definition
    including a review by the ECM.  It is not possible to construe "refusal
    of entry clearance" as including a review by the ECM.  I  am  satisfied
    that the ECO's decision was the refusal of entry clearance and that all
    the ECM did was to maintain that decision.

 8. Therefore, given that I am satisfied that at the date of decision there
    were outstanding amounts which had not been paid, the judge was correct
    in her finding that there was no error in the respondent's decision and
    that the respondent acted in accordance with the law  in  refusing  the
    applicant's application due to the outstanding NHS charges.

 9. Although the respondent attempted to  raise  an  additional  ground  of
    cross-appeal under Rule 24(3)(e), as I indicated to Mr  Bramble,  I  am
    not satisfied that this was properly before the  Tribunal  and  do  not
    propose to consider it here.

10. Although not a matter for the Upper Tribunal, Mr Bramble  indicated  to
    the sponsor that a fresh application with all the documents  would  now
    need to be made.  There was a discussion in relation  to  the  argument
    that NHS  records  according  to  the  respondent  indicated  that  the
    appellant actually owed �5,034. Mr Abdel Aziz told the  Upper  Tribunal
    that he was not aware where this figure had come from and I accept that
    the records in the respondent's bundle clearly show  that  the  invoice
    from the hospital was for �4,581 and that that amount was  paid  on  27
    May 2015. It was therefore not clear to me where  the  additional  �453
    has come from.  I suggested to the sponsor that it would  be  expedient
    for him to resolve this prior to submitting a  fresh  application,  for
    example by obtaining documentary evidence from  the  hospital  and  any
    other NHS providers that were used by the appellant.  Such  information
    could be submitted with any fresh application.  Again  that  is  not  a
    matter for the Upper Tribunal.

Decision

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not  disclose  a  material
    error of law and shall stand. The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction was sought or is appropriate in these circumstances.
