Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Khan, Counsel, instructed by Kalam Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Pal (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh. The appellants are 29 and 27
    years  of  age  respectively.  They  applied  on  June  11,  2013   for
    Certificates of Entitlement to the Right of Abode under  section  2  of
    the Immigration Act 1971. The respondent refused both  applications  on
    October 8, 2013 on the grounds the appellants had failed to demonstrate
    they were related as claimed.

 2. The  appellants  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on November 12, 2013.

 3.  The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Flynn
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ")  on  July  4,  2014  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on August 1, 2014 he  dismissed  both  appellants'
    appeals under the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

 4. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on August 27,  2014.  Judge  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  Saffer  refused  permission  to  appeal   on
    September 29, 2014 finding that the FtTJ made findings that  were  open
    to him.

 5. The appellants renewed their grounds  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  on
    January 13, 2015  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Chalkley  granted  permission
    finding it was arguable the FtTJ had erred.

 6. The respondent filed two Rule 24 responses dated  January  21  and  23,
    2015 in which she submitted the FtTJ had correctly  addressed  all  the
    issues.

 7. The matter came before me on the date set out above and  on  that  date
    the appellant was represented by Counsel as detailed above.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 8. Mr Khan adopted his skeleton argument and submitted the FtTJ had failed
    to give reasons on issues central to the appeal. The  Tribunal  in  the
    decisions of MK (Duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT  00641  and
    Budathoki (reasons for  decisions)  [2014]  UKUT  00341  made  clear  a
    determination must disclose clearly  the  reasons  for  the  Tribunal's
    decision and if a Tribunal  found  oral  evidence  to  be  implausible,
    incredible  or  unreliable  or  a  document  to  be  worth  no   weight
    whatsoever, it was necessary to say so in  the  determination  and  for
    such findings to be supported by  reasons.  A  bare  statement  that  a
    witness was not believed or that a document was afforded no weight  was
    unlikely to satisfy the requirement to give reasons. Mr Khan submitted:



          a. A former judge prepared the village report and greater  weight
             should have been attached to this  document  or  alternatively
             reasons for rejecting it should have been given.

          b. The DNA report, the FtTJ felt should have been produced, would
             prove nothing because the sponsor  and  appellants  were  only
             cousins. The FtTJ wrongly placed too much weight on  the  lack
             of a report.

          c. The FtTJ failed to  give  any  reasons  why  he  rejected  the
             sponsor's evidence.

          d. The FtTJ did not have regard to the fact the  money  transfers
             were 30 years ago. ï¿½20 was not insubstantial amount  then  and
             it was not reasonable to expect documents from that  long  ago
             to still be in existence.

          e. The FtTJ should have looked at  evidence  overall.  There  was
             plenty of evidence  the  appellants'  father  was  married  as
             claimed as evidence such as letters, passports and remittances
             all supported his claim. The FtTJ attached no weight  to  this
             evidence.

 9. Ms Pal relied on the Rule 24 letters save she accepted  that  the  FtTJ
    was wrong to have  placed  weight  on  the  absence  of  DNA  evidence.
    However, she submitted the error was not material because he had  given
    numerous other reasons for rejecting their claim. The appellants needed
    to  prove  their  relationship  and  the  FtTJ  considered  the   birth
    certificates and photographs and  gave  reasons  for  attaching  little
    weight to them. He also had regard to the letter from  the  appellant's
    mother but he attached little weight to that because it  pre-dated  the
    first appellant's birth by six  years.  The  FtTJ  had  regard  to  the
    sponsor's evidence but found it unreliable. At paragraph [32] the  FtTJ
    referred to the village visit report and whilst  he  made  no  specific
    findings he said he had given it  careful  consideration  but  balanced
    that alongside other evidence and reached a conclusion that was open to
    him.

10. I reserved my decision.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

11. The real issue in the grounds raised before was  what  weight  or  what
    consideration did the FtTJ have for the evidence. Mr Khan  argued  that
    the FtTJ either failed to consider certain evidence and if  he  did  he
    failed to give reasons for rejecting the same.  Ms  Pal  has  submitted
    that whilst the decision was not perfect there was  no  material  error
    because ultimately the FtTJ considered all of the evidence and  reached
    findings that were open to him.

12. During submissions Ms Pal agreed that the FtTJ had been wrong to  place
    weight on the failure to provide a DNA report.

13. I raised with Ms Pal that  the  FtTJ  appeared  to  place  considerable
    emphasis on the absence of DNA evidence and  whether  this  would  have
    affected the FtTJ's assessment of  the  evidence.  I  referred  her  in
    particular to paragraphs [36] and [39] where the FtTJ discussed the DNA
    evidence and concluded-

         "In the absence of a DNA report I agree with  the  respondent  that
         there is insufficient evidence to show that the appellants'  father
         was a British citizen at the time of their birth...."

14. Ms Pal's argument was that the FtTJ was wrong to place  weight  on  the
    DNA evidence and if he had rejected the claim  for  that  reason  alone
    then he would  have  erred.  However,  she  submitted  that  the  FtTJ,
    contrary to Mr  Khan's  submissions,  did  consider  the  evidence  and
    concluded for separate reasons that there was insufficient evidence  to
    prove the relationship.

15. I accept the argument that reliance on the DNA evidence can mean  there
    is an error but in order to consider whether the error was  material  a
    thorough examination of the FtTJ's findings and  consideration  of  the
    evidence submitted was required. This involves a consideration  of  all
    of the issues raised quite properly by Mr Khan.

16. I am satisfied the FtTJ was aware of all of the relevant  evidence  and
    salient issues because he refers  to  them  in  his  determination.  At
    paragraphs [2] and [3] he set  out  the  respective  positions  of  the
    parties up to and including the issuing of the refusal letter. He noted
    at paragraph [4] that great weight was to be placed on a village report
    prepared by a former judge.

17. This report is an important piece of  evidence  according  to  Mr  Khan
    because it was an enquiry undertaken by an  independent  person  albeit
    instructed by the appellants' solicitors. At paragraph  [32]  the  FtTJ
    stated, "I have given careful consideration to the village visit report
    by Mr AKM Shafiuddin, Barrister-at-Law and a former High Court Judge in
    Bangladesh. Mr Shafiuddin spoke to a number of people  in  the  village
    who all said that the appellants were the children of  the  late  Abdul
    Khalick. He also visited their home and examined their documents  which
    he regarded as genuine and considered to be strong evidence in  support
    of the claimed relationship."

18. Mr Khan's criticism is  that  the  FtTJ  failed  to  give  reasons  for
    rejecting a document that supported the appellants' claims. The  answer
    to that criticism is contained in the subsequent  paragraphs  when  the
    FtTJ gave his reasons for rejecting the claims. He stated:

          a. There was no  evidence  that  linked  the  appellants  with  a
             British father directly.

          b. The sponsor's evidence was unreliable because:

               i. He found his claim that DNA testing  was  only  undertaken
                  because his solicitor made a mistake.

              ii. His claim that he wrote to the respondent  saying  he  was
                  not a blood relative was inconsistent with other  evidence
                  including his  claim  he  and  the  appellants  are  first
                  cousins.

          c. The appellants were unable to explain what living arrangements
             were proposed during their interview.

          d. They had never previously attempted to visit the sponsor.

19. I am satisfied the FtTJ was aware of what the report said but  found  a
    number of factors undermined the  content  of  that  report  and  those
    factors outweighed the information being put forward. All of the points
    raised by the FtTJ were findings open to the FtTJ. The lack  of  direct
    evidence was a factor the FtTJ was entitled to take into account as was
    the explanation about the circumstances in which he was asked to take a
    DNA test. The necessity for a DNA test is a different point and has  no
    bearing on this  other  finding.  He  gave  reason  for  rejecting  the
    sponsor's evidence and I cannot say those findings  were  not  open  to
    him. Clearly, it was open to him to have accepted the evidence  of  the
    village visit report but he rejected its findings and gave  reasons  as
    required by the Tribunal in MK.

20. The FtTJ then went on to consider  other  aspects  of  the  appellant's
    grounds of appeal. He made a finding about the birth  certificates  and
    Mr Khan does not submit that finding was not open to him.

21.  I  referred  earlier  to  my  concerns  over  paragraph  [39]  of  the
    determination.  However,  the  FtTJ  was  not  satisfied  the  evidence
    submitted demonstrated the relationship  claimed.  If  there  had  been
    relevant DNA evidence then this may have assisted  the  appellants  but
    there was none and I am satisfied his approach in paragraph  [39]  does
    not amount to an error in law.

22. The FtTJ considered the money receipts and there is nothing wrong  with
    his actual finding in paragraph [39]. It is difficult to argue that two
    money receipts are proof of the relationship regardless of their value.
    The burden of proving their relationship lies with the  appellants  and
    the evidence submitted to him did not persuade the  FtTJ.  He  had  had
    regard not only to the money transfers but also the lack of photographs
    and letters.

23. He concluded at paragraph [42], "Looking at the evidence as a  whole  I
    find the respondent's decision was properly  based  and  in  accordance
    with the law."

24. I am  not  considering  the  evidence  as  a  First-tier  Judge.  I  am
    considering whether the FtTJ materially erred and having considered all
    of the above I am satisfied there is no error in law.

Decision

25. The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal did not disclose an  error  in
    law and I uphold the original decisions and I dismiss  the  appellants'
    appeals.

26. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier and I see  no  reason  to  amend  that
    order.
