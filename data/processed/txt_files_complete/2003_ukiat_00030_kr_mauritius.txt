                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The Appellant is a citizen of Mauritius.  She has been given leave to
      appeal  the  determination  of  an  Adjudicator  (Miss  J   Grimmett)
      dismissing her appeal against the Respondent's decision of  23  April
      2003 to refuse her entry clearance to the United Kingdom with a  view
      to settlement as the spouse of a person present and  settled  in  the
      United Kingdom.   The refusal was under paragraph 320(11) of HC 395.

2.    The hearing was listed for 10:00 am.   By 10:25  am  the  Appellant's
      representatives had not arrived.  The sponsor was present and told us
      that his wife's representatives were due to meet him at 9:30 am.   We
      proceeded with the hearing in their absence.  It is clear that proper
      notice of the hearing had been given.  The representatives  had  sent
      the sponsor a copy of the notice  of  hearing  giving  the  time  and
      place.  Miss J Sigley, a Home Office Presenting Officer,  represented
      the Respondent.

3.    The Appellant has a poor immigration history.  She entered the United
      Kingdom as a visitor with  six-months  leave  on  25  July  1997  but
      remained until 8 June 2001 without  leave,  except  for  the  initial
      period.  She also worked in breach of the conditions attached to  the
      grant of leave.  She married the sponsor on 2 May  2001  and  made  a
      voluntary departure  from  the  United  Kingdom  to  Mauritius  on  9
      December  2001  in  order  to  make  a  proper  marriage   settlement
      application from there.

4.    The Respondent  refused  the  application  solely  on  the  basis  of
      paragraph 320 (11) of HC 395, which applies where there  has  been  a
      "failure to observe the time limit  or  conditions  attached  to  any
      grant of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom".   Paragraph
      320 contains two sets of grounds.  The  first  are  those  "on  which
      entry clearance or leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  is  to  be
      refused.  The second, under which subparagraph (11) falls, are  those
      "on which entry clearance or leave to enter the United Kingdom should
      normally be refused."

6.    It is clear that the first set of grounds are  mandatory  whilst  the
      second, applicable in this case, are discretionary.  Paragraph  21(b)
      of Part III of Schedule 4 to the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  1999
      provides that an Adjudicator must allow an  appeal  if  he  considers
      that, if the decision or action involves the exercise of a discretion
      by the Secretary of State or an officer, that the  discretion  should
      have  been  exercised  differently.    In   such   circumstances   an
      Adjudicator must consider the way in which the  discretion  has  been
      exercised.  The Adjudicator did  little  more  than  agree  with  the
      Respondent's conclusion that this was a case which  came  within  the
      category where entry clearance "should normally be  refused".   Where
      the Respondent's decision involved the  exercise  of  discretion  the
      Adjudicator should have  considered  all  the  material  facts.   The
      question  of  whether  there  has  been  a  proper  exercise  of  the
      discretion cannot be answered except against a  background  of  clear
      findings as to  all  the  material  facts.   It  is  clear  that  the
      Adjudicator did not  do  this.   Although  some  material  facts  are
      mentioned the Adjudicator does not, for example,  begin  to  consider
      the facts going to the heart of the underlying marriage  application.
      She has in effect considered most of the factors which go against the
      Appellant and few of those which may tell in her favour.  There is no
      mention of the fact that the Appellant made  a  voluntary  return  to
      Mauritius in order to make a proper marriage application.   There  is
      no assessment of the submission that  the  Appellant  meets  all  the
      requirements for marriage settlement  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
      Whilst it is not likely that the Appellant will succeed under Article
      8 if she fails under the Immigration  Rules  the  Adjudicator  should
      have given more detailed  consideration  to  the  Article  8  grounds
      against the background of clear findings of fact.

6.    Neither  Mr  Sigley  nor  the  sponsor  objected  to  remittal.   The
      determination is flawed.  When allow the appeal to the extent that it
      is remitted for hearing afresh before an Adjudicator other than  Miss
      J Grimmett.
