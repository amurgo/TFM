Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Duffy (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Cutting (Legal Representative)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant, born July 1, 1980 is a citizen of Poland. The  appellant
    came to the United Kingdom on January 12,  2004  and  began  exercising
    treaty rights on June 7, 2005. She maintained  that  she  continued  to
    exercise that right continuously for five years save that there  was  a
    period when she was not working due to pregnancy. On  January  8,  2014
    she  applied  for  permanent  residence.  The  respondent  refused  her
    application on February 25, 2014 as she was not satisfied the appellant
    had demonstrated she had been working throughout the required period.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  Regulation  26
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  on  March
    14, 2014. On August 13, 2014 Judge of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Broe
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") heard her  appeal.  He  allowed
    the appeal under the 2006 Regulations  in  a  decision  promulgated  on
    September 16, 2014. On a side note her husband's  appeal  as  a  family
    dependant was also allowed.

 4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on October 9, 2014  in  respect
    of this appellant only. She submitted the FtTJ erred  in  allowing  the
    appeal. On November 17, 2014 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Grant
    granted permission to appeal finding it  arguable  the  FtTJ  may  have
    erred by finding treaty rights were exercised throughout  the  relevant
    period.

 5. The appellant was in attendance and was represented.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 6. Mr Duffy submitted that the main issue of this appeal was  whether  the
    appellant had provided satisfactory and adequate evidence to  show  she
    was exercising treaty rights. He submitted that the FtTJ had  erred  by
    making the finding she did because there was insufficient evidence  put
    forward to show she  was  working  on  a  self-employed  basis  between
    September 2007 and July 2010. There was evidence that no tax  had  been
    assessed as payable and there was clear evidence of non-payment by  her
    of NI payments for the periods 2008  to  2010.  There  was  a  lack  of
    evidence about monies from  invoices  matching  payments  in  the  bank
    account and he submitted  the  FtTJ  had  erred.  He  accepted  it  was
    arguable that  being  on  maternity  leave  would  not  interfere  with
    continuous period of exercising treaty rights.

 7. Mr Cutting argued the FtTJ had considered all of the submitted invoices
    and had had the opportunity of viewing  the  appellant's  full  invoice
    books covering the whole period. It was submitted the  bank  statements
    showed credits and supported her claim she was working as claimed as  a
    cleaner. Evidence of tax payments and NI liability was before the FtTJ.
    He accepted she did not work when she was on maternity lave but  argued
    that the decision of Jessy Saint Prix v Secretary of State for Work and
    Pensions [2014] WLR(D) 275 confirmed that  the  United  Government  was
    wrong to find that a person who was not actually working when they were
    on maternity leave. He submitted the evidence showed that save for when
    she was off on maternity leave she was working for the relevant period.




    ASSESSEMENT OF ERROR OF LAW


 8. There were two issues raised in the grounds of appeal and  whilst  they
    are distinct points they are nevertheless connected. In order  for  the
    appellant to meet the requirements of the Regulations for the  purposes
    of showing she is entitled to permanent residence  she  would  have  to
    show that the period when she did not work during her pregnancy did not
    break the continuity of her status.

 9. The first issue for me to consider is whether the appellant remained  a
    qualifying person  during  the  period  of  her  maternity  leave.  The
    evidence before me suggests that she ceased working on October 15, 2009
    and was then off work until  July  14,  2010.  The  appellant  has  two
    children and the relevant child  was  born  on  January  11,  2010.  UK
    legislation allows a person to take twelve months off work and  as  the
    appellant claimed to have  worked  until  October  2009  she  would  be
    entitled to be off work until October 2010. For the  purposes  of  this
    appeal I am only concerned with the period of absence until  July  2010
    as if she could prove five years continuous status  as  a  worker  then
    anything after that July 2010 date would be irrelevant.

10. The Court found in Jessy Saint Prix v Secretary of State for  Work  and
    Pensions [2014] WLR(D) 275 that an employed person was entitled to give
    up work both before she was due to give birth and remain  off  work  in
    the aftermath of giving birth. I  am  satisfied  for  the  purposes  of
    maternity leave there is no distinction between  someone  employed  and
    someone who is self-employed and Mr Duffy did not argue  the  time  she
    took off for her pregnancy was unnecessary. I therefore find  that  the
    fact the appellant did not physically work  between  October  2009  and
    July 2010 does not interfere with her status as a worker under the 2006
    Regulations.

11. Turning to the other ground the FtTJ had evidence of  work  (invoices),
    bank statements and tax calculations. He considered the evidence  along
    with the letter of NI payments from HMRC. The only period where she did
    not pay NI was when she was on maternity leave  and  that  was  between
    part of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. After that she returned to  employment
    and paid Class 1 NI payments. There was evidence of monies  being  paid
    into her NatWest  bank  account  up  to  October  2009.  Maternity  pay
    commenced on October 15, 2009 and continued to July 2010.

12. The FtTJ had regard to  all  of  the  written  and  oral  evidence  and
    concluded that the appellant was working. The Regulations do not  state
    the level of income needed to be "economically active" but the evidence
    presented suggests she was paying into her account on a regular  basis.
    Between June 2005 and 2007  she  was  employed  at  Starbucks  and  the
    respondent took no issue with her status. Her challenge related to  the
    period when she worked as a cleaner.

13. The FtTJ was satisfied the appellant demonstrated she was active  as  a
    cleaner and working in compliance with the Regulations.  Mr  Duffy  has
    not persuaded me that the FtTJ erred.

14. I find there is no error in law.

    DECISION


15. There was no material error of law and I uphold the original decision.

16. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
