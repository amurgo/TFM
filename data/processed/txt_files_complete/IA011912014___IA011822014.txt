                      CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL PURSUANT TO
        RULE 17 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

1.    The appellant has been granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Handley  who,
      by  a  determination  promulgated  on  15  May   2014,   allowed   the
      respondents' appeals brought before the  First-tier  Tribunal  against
      the refusal to grant them leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
      Student Migrant and as a Dependant Partner of a Points  Based  Migrant
      under the Points-Based System.

2.    The Upper Tribunal has received a letter from the Secretary  of  State
      dated 14 August 2014 in which she states that she wishes  to  withdraw
      her case before the Upper Tribunal and to reconsider the applications.

3.    Rule  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provides for a party to withdraw its case before the  Upper  Tribunal,
      with the consent of the Tribunal.


4.    In the light of a letter dated 5 September 2014 from the  respondents'
      solicitors agreeing to that course, the Tribunal hereby gives  consent
      to the appellant withdrawing her case.

5.    The effect of the appellant's case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
      Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are  at  an
      end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal and the decision  of
      the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
