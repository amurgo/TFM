                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Shimmin made following a hearing at Bradford on 7th January 2014.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Afghanistan, born on  20th  October  1975.
    He applied for leave to remain in the UK on the basis that he was in  a
    relationship with an unmarried partner  of  a  British  national,  Ruth
    Elizabeth Wood, since January 2013 and had been residing with her since
    February 2013, but was refused on the following grounds.  As the couple
    had only been residing together for five months at the date of decision
    the claimant did not meet the  requirements  of  paragraph  GEN.1.2  of
    Appendix FM. He claimed to live with his partner and  stepdaughter  but
    did not have parental responsibility  for  her  and  failed  to  fulfil
    paragraph  E-LTRPT.2.3.   He  also  failed  to  meet  the   eligibility
    requirements and therefore could not benefit from the criteria  as  set
    out in EX1 and failed to meet the requirements  in respect  of  private
    life under Article 8 under paragraph 276ADE.

 3. The judge set out the law and the oral  evidence.  Since  the  date  of
    decision the claimant had married at the Sheffield Registry  Office  on
    23rd October 2013 and as at the date of  hearing they had been   living
    together for eleven months.

 4. The judge recorded that the claimant  had  had  a  complex  immigration
    history, including a claim on the basis of a previous British  partner.
    He found that the claimant's marriage to his previous partner  was  not
    valid under UK law and there is no challenge  to  that  aspect  of  his
    decision.

 5. The judge accepted that he was in a genuine and subsisting relationship
    with his present wife and again his findings are not challenged.

 6. He then wrote as follows:

         "32.  I find that the Appellant does not have to meet the financial
             requirements under E-LTRP because he  meets  the  requirements
             of EX.1 (E-LTRP.3.1(c).  Namely,  he  is  in  is  genuine  and
             subsisting relationship with a British citizen.  Miss  Birtles
             accepts that Fauzia (formerly Ruth  Wood)  a  British  citizen
             with British citizen children.  She would not be  expected  to
             leave the  UK   and  did  not  argue  that  no  insurmountable
             obstacles exist. After considering all the evidence before me,
             and the absence of submissions  from the  Respondent,  I  find
             that there are insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  with
             the Appellant continuing outside the UK."

         He allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and  on  general
    Article 8 principles.

The Grounds of Application

 7. The Secretary of State sought permission to  appeal  in  the  following
    terms:

         "It is respectfully submitted  that  the  Tribunal  has  failed  to
         provide adequate reasons for the finding that the Appellant is in a
         genuine  and  subsisting   relationship  in  accordance  with   the
         Immigration Rules and why he does not need to  meet  the  financial
         requirements under the Rules.  It is submitted that at the date  of
         his application he and his wife were not married and had  not  been
         in a relationship  akin  to  marriage  as  they  had  only  resided
         together for five months at the date of  decision  and  still  have
         only resided together for a total of eleven months at the  date  of
         decision.  It is submitted that the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
         requirement of the Immigration Rules at the date  of  decision  and
         the Tribunal has failed to provide adequate reasons why it would be
         disproportionate to require him to return to  Afghanistan  to  seek
         entry clearance to return given that he does not  meet  the  Rules,
         has been able to return  to  Afghanistan  for  an  extended  period
         without any difficulties and his wife would be able to continue  to
         care for her child as she was able to do  before  her  relationship
         with the Appellant."

 8. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  Kimnell  for  the  reasons
    stated in the grounds on 28th January 2014.

Submissions

 9. Mr Diwnycz relied on  his grounds and on the case of Sabir (Appendix FM
    - EX1 not freestanding) [2014] UKUT 00063.  He did not  seek  to  argue
    that the judge's findings with respect to  the  relationship  were  not
    open to him.

10. Miss Frantzis submitted that the claimant could  successfully  navigate
    through the relevant Rules and rely on the exception as set out in EX1.

Findings and Conclusions

11. Under the definitions section of Appendix FM - Family  members  GEN.1.2
    for the purpose of this appendix partner means -

         "(i)     the applicant's spouse;

         (ii)     the applicant's civil partner;

         (iii)    the applicant's fiancï¿½ or proposed civil partner; or

         (iv)     a person who has been living together with  the  applicant
             in a relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership  for
             at least two years prior to the date  of  application,  unless
             the context otherwise requires."

12. As at the date of the hearing, the couple had married.   Miss  Frantzis
    initially sought to argue that, in reliance  on  Section  85.4  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002,  on  an  appeal  under
    Section 82.1, 83.2 or  83.A2  against  a  decision,  the  Tribunal  may
    consider evidence about any matter which  it  thinks  relevant  to  the
    substance of the decision including evidence which  concerns  a  matter
    arising after the date  of  decision.  She  submitted  that  since  the
    claimant was now a spouse, he met the definition of Family member.

13. However Section 85.4 does not avail the  claimant.   The  fact  of  the
    marriage is a factor which could be taken into account as evidence of a
    genuine and subsisting  relationship  but  the  decision  before  Judge
    Shimmin was whether the Secretary of  State  had  made  a  decision  in
    accordance with the law and the Immigration Rules.  An  applicant  does
    not succeed by showing that he now meets the requirements of the Rules.
    He can only succeed by showing that he  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules at the time that the decision was taken.

14. As at that time the claimant did not meet the requirements for  limited
    leave to remain as a partner as defined and therefore could not benefit
    from paragraph EX1 which is not a freestanding requirement in the Rules
    and is accessible only to those who have "successfully navigated  their
    way through the  second  of  the  alternative  routes  through  R-LTRP"
    (Sabir)

15. Since EX1 is parasitic on a Rule within Appendix FM  and  the  claimant
    could not meet the substantive requirements in relation to  partner  of
    Appendix FM,  the judge erred in  his conclusion that the appeal should
    have been allowed under the Immigration Rules.

16. His decision is set aside.

17. However Mr Diwnycz did not seek to argue that it would be proportionate
    for the claimant to be removed.  On the  undisturbed  findings  of  the
    judge he was in a genuine marriage and living with  a  British  citizen
    spouse and British  citizen  stepchild.   It  was  not  argued  by  the
    Presenting Officer below or by him that there were  not  insurmountable
    obstacles to the mother and child relocating to  live  in  Afghanistan,
    given that the claimant met the substantive requirements  of  paragraph
    EX1.  He accepted that the appeal ought to  be  allowed  on  Article  8
    grounds.

Decision

18. The judge erred in law. His decision is set aside.   It  is  remade  as
    follows.  The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.   It  is
    allowed with respect to Article 8.
