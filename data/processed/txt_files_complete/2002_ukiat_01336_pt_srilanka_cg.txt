                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr M Smith (counsel instructed by MK Sri & Co) for the appellant
Miss A Green for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator (Mr PB Rose), sitting
   at Hatton Cross on 29 November, dismissing an  asylum  and  human  rights
   appeal by a Tamil  citizen of Sri Lanka, from directions for  removal  as
   an illegal entrant on 24 April 2001. Leave was given on the basis that


   a) (although the adjudicator was  said  to  have  had  good  reasons  for
      refusing an adjournment to get it before him), the psychiatric  report
      now available ought to be considered; and
   b) his treatment of the scarring issue was "perhaps debatable".


2. The scarring point, to do Mr Smith justice, did not  appear  amongst  his
   grounds of appeal, and  was  not  pursued  by  him  with  any  particular
   enthusiasm. It can be quickly disposed of. What the adjudicator  said  on
   it was this:

   59. However, the appellant has a mark on his head which  might  in  other
   circumstances bring him to the attention of the authorities were he to be
   returned but it is clear from that mark that it would have no  connection
   with the appellant being kept in detention and indeed  was  caused  by  a
   shrapnel wound and to my mind would not give rise to any suspicion on the
   part of the Sri Lankan authorities with regard to  the  appellant  having
   been previously arrested in Sri Lanka.



   Clearly the adjudicator asked himself the right question (what would  the
   Sri Lanka authorities think of the scar? - see Selvarajah [00/HX/00972]),
   and came to an answer he was entitled to reach (that a shrapnel wound, by
   its nature indiscriminate, was not likely to lead to individual suspicion
   - see Jeyarajasingham [01/TH/01845], to which we referred Mr Smith).

3. Mr Smith did seek to pursue one other  point,  on  which  leave  was  not
   given. It appears as � 2 of his grounds of appeal, where it is  presented
   as  a  contradictory  finding  of  fact  by  the  adjudicator.  What  the
   adjudicator had said was that the adjudicator might be rounded  up  as  a
   young Tamil  in Colombo and detained for a limited period, but that  this
   would not amount to Refugee Convention persecution. Mr Smith's attack  on
   that conclusion really  amounts  to  a  challenge  to  the  adjudicator's
   interpretation of the  background  evidence,  and  not  to  his  internal
   consistency. As we pointed out to Mr Smith, this  Tribunal  has  taken  a
   (perhaps remarkably) consistent position over the last several  years  on
   the situation facing young Tamils in  Colombo.  The  background  evidence
   shows that, while they may face detention for identification for up to 48
   hours, that does not normally involve ill-treatment, and may be  regarded
   as a legitimate response by the authorities  to  the  security  situation
   from time to time. Only if there is some cause for  particular  suspicion
   in the individual case is there any real risk of longer detention or ill-
   treatment. Mr Smith did not seek to challenge that view  of  the  general
   situation, so we return to this appellant's individual case.

4. The real challenge to the adjudicator's treatment of it was  based  on  a
   report headed "22nd November 2000", but clearly prepared on that date  in
   2001, following examination, through an interpreter, on 29  October.  How
   it was that this was not made available to the adjudicator when he sat on
   29 November is not explained in the grounds of appeal; nor did  Mr  Smith
   do so before us. We have no means of knowing whether  the  author,  Dr  A
   Coleman, or the solicitors were at fault: one or the other of them  sadly
   let down both the appellant and the administration of justice. Apart from
   basic medical qualifications, Dr Coleman is a member of the Royal College
   of Psychiatrists, and says he has research experience and publications in
   depressive illness, though he gives no details of that. Mr  Smith's  case
   on his report is that its conclusions were capable of

   a) affecting the substance of  the  appellant's  claim  under  the  Human
      Rights Convention;
   b) corroborating his claims to  have  been  subjected  to  detention  and
      torture; and
   c) affecting the view the adjudicator had taken of  his  demeanour  while
      giving evidence.



5. Dr Coleman's report can be divided into two parts.  First  there  is  the
   appellant's history, which appears at pp 1-8. Then there is Dr  Coleman's
   opinion, at  pp  8-11.  Interpersed  in  the  history  are  a  number  of
   observations by Dr Coleman, to the effect that the appellant

   (p5)     "presented as an extremely harassed individual"
   (p7)     "presented as a very sad and despondent individual"
   (p8)     did not want to face questions about his claimed  detention  and
           torture in Sri Lanka, tried to get over the subject  as  quickly
           as possible, but could not, and became "tense and anguished  and
           distressed".


   Dr Coleman then says he did not dwell too long on this "because I felt it
   was causing him too much distress". He concludes that  the  appellant  is
   suffering from  "Post  Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  and  also  Depressive
   Illness". The following  two  sections,  under  'Opinion',  set  out  the
   details of these, taken entirely from the appellant's own history. At  no
   point does Dr Coleman say either what led him to accept that history,  or
   how it led logically to a finding that the appellant was  suffering  from
   those two conditions. � 3 is a general statement about the  suicide  risk
   presented by persons so afflicted: nothing is added as  to  Dr  Coleman's
   own opinion of this appellant's condition, though some further history is
   given. Then come the following paragraphs

   4. Treatment.

   This is important. A combination of antidepressant treatment and
   Cognitive Behavioural Therapy over a long period of time is required. It
   will take a long time to heal all the scars that are present in his mind.


   5. Prognosis.

   This is poor. It will take a long time for Mr Pirahalathan to recover. I
   would envisage that it will take three to five years before he is
   anything like a mentally healthy individual.


      Again no reasoning is shown for the  opinions  expressed.  The  report
   ends with an expression of concern at the appellant's stated intention of
   killing himself  here,  if  he  faced  return  to  Sri  Lanka,  and  that
   "Notwithstanding [sic: the contrast is not immediately apparent] the risk
   of suicide, there is also a risk of a  catastrophic  breakdown",  if  the
   appellant were returned to a situation in which he had  previously  faced
   "severe or life threatening trauma".

6. We raised Dr Coleman's modus operandi with Mr  Smith  at  the  outset  of
   this part of the case. Mr Smith was unable to identify any bases for  the
   opinions given, other than the remarks we have set out above. He put  his
   case quite  simply  on  the  footing  that  Dr  Coleman  is  a  qualified
   consultant psychiatrist, who had taken the appellant's history, and  must
   have had good reasons for accepting it. As Mr Smith said, it is not  easy
   to evaluate expert evidence when the giver  is  not  present  for  cross-
   examination; as he also had to acknowledge, that imposes  a  particularly
   important duty on expert witnesses in these cases,  who  must  know  that
   they will hardly ever be required to  attend  for  cross-examination,  to
   provide the adjudicator or us with  the  proper  critical  apparatus  for
   evaluating their opinions. Mr Smith suggested that Dr Coleman  might  not
   be aware of this: if that is so, then he ought not to put himself forward
   as an expert witness. Expert witnesses ought not to be  regarded,  or  to
   regard themselves, as in the  position  of  a  magus,  who  has  only  to
   manifest himself as such for everything he says to be accepted. It is for
   the adjudicator to judge the case: though of course he should pay  proper
   attention to soundly based  expert  evidence,  that  evidence  cannot  be
   soundly based if it does not provide him with some means of evaluating it
   beyond the giver's qualifications.

7. If Dr Coleman's diagnosis is  accepted,  then  it  might  be  capable  of
   supporting the submissions for which Mr Smith relied on it. The  question
   is whether it should be or not. The only  observations  of  Dr  Coleman's
   which add anything to the appellant's history are his descriptions of him
   as "an  extremely  harassed  individual",  "a  very  sad  and  despondent
   individual", and "tense and anguished and distressed". While  these  were
   no doubt sincerely formed  personal  impressions,  they  hardly  seem  to
   require or  derive  any  particular  support  from  the  expertise  of  a
   consultant psychiatrist. None of them correspond with  anything  observed
   by the adjudicator, who must be regarded as equally  capable  of  forming
   personal impressions of human behaviour within the normal range. Mr Smith
   suggested that they might have made the adjudicator think again about the
   way he dealt with the appellant's demeanour, at  �  64:  "The  manner  in
   which the appellant answered questions and his demeanour were such that I
   found it difficult to accept that  the  appellant  was  credible  and  in
   particular I note that he was asked one question five times before giving
   a reply". Miss Green pointed out that  the  appellant  had  had  no  such
   difficulties with Dr Coleman.

8. Making all due allowances for the less relaxed atmosphere  of  an  appeal
   hearing, we find that particular observation of the adjudicator's hard to
   reconcile with the view of the appellant put forward by Dr Coleman. If Dr
   Coleman's report had been before him, no doubt the adjudicator would have
   taken it into consideration; but what Dr Coleman says does not invalidate
   the adjudicator's view. Quite possibly if Dr  Coleman  had  been  present
   before the adjudicator to hear the evidence, as medical  witnesses  often
   are in other fields, then seeing the appellant  failing  to  reply  to  a
   question till the sixth time of asking would have made him alter his  own
   view. What is quite clear, as Miss Green also pointed  out,  is  that  Dr
   Coleman's report provides no psychiatric basis for any inability  of  the
   appellant's to understand or answer questions. While it is possible that,
   if called to give oral evidence, Dr Coleman might have been able to  give
   enough of the reasons behind the conclusions he expressed to support  the
   diagnoses he reached, we do not regard his report as it stands as capable
   of doing so to  the  extent  of  invalidating  either  the  adjudicator's
   credibility findings, or his views on the appellant's  demeanour.  It  is
   quite hard enough for adjudicators to be expected to try these  cases  on
   reports by expert witnesses they hardly ever see: for their decisions  to
   be successfully impeached after the event on the basis  of  reports  they
   have never seen at all requires some  serious  objective  basis  for  the
   conclusions expressed, which in our view is wholly missing in the present
   case. It is not as if there were a  complete  absence  of  any  objective
   standards in this field: see for example the often-used DSM-IV criteria.
9. It follows that we do not see Dr Coleman's report as providing any  basis
   for interfering with the adjudicator's decision, one clearly reached with
   considerable care. We have already dealt with the other challenges to it,
   and the appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed
