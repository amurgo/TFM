                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Immigration History

 1. The Appellant in this appeal  was  the  Respondent  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing on 22 July 2014 before Judge Onoufriou.  However,  for
    ease of reference, the Appellant and Respondent are hereafter  referred
    to as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.  Therefore Ms  Akpedeye
    is referred to as the Appellant and the Secretary of State is  referred
    to as the Respondent.

 2. The Appellant had a  multi  visit  visa,  which  was  cancelled  on  19
    December 2013, when she sought entry to the UK  on  the  basis  of  her
    visit visa. She left the UK voluntarily and lodged an  out  of  country
    appeal. The Respondent did not supply a bundle for the purposes of  the
    hearing before Judge Onoufriou.  In the Notice of Refusal of  Leave  to
    Enter (the Notice), it is stated:

          "You were given entry clearance which had effect as leave to enter
         the United Kingdom on 19/12/12 but I am satisfied  that  there  has
         been  a  significant  change  of  circumstances  since  your  entry
         clearance was issued because you owe more than �12,000 to the North
         East London NHS Treatment Centre in accordance  with  the  relevant
         regulations on charges to overseas visitors and I therefore  cancel
         your continuing leave. If your leave  was  conferred  by  an  entry
         clearance this will also have the effect of cancelling  your  entry
         clearance."

 3. The Respondent applied for permission to appeal on the basis  that  the
    Judge had materially misdirected himself in law because  the  Appellant
    was refused under "Rule 321A(i)" of the Immigration rules, which  is  a
    non-discretionary provision, but the Judge purported  to  find  it  was
    refused under "Rule 322 (12)", and "allowed the  appeal  on  the  basis
    that the Immigration Officer had  failed  to  exercise  the  discretion
    necessary to the  operation  of  that  Rule;  he  then  exercised  that
    discretion himself in favour of the Appellant."

 4. Permission was granted because an arguable error was disclosed  by  the
    application.

 5. A Rule 24 response was not filed on behalf of the  Appellant.  However,
    at the hearing, Mr George provided a skeleton argument, a copy of  SSHD
    v Boahen [201] EWCA Civ 585 and Palisetty v SSHD [2014]  EWHC  (QB)  on
    which he sought to rely, and a bundle containing some  documents  which
    were before the Judge and updated witness statements. I made  it  clear
    that for the purposes of  the  error  of  law  hearing,  I  would  only
    consider the documents which were before the Judge and the  authorities
    that Mr George sought to rely on for the purposes of his submissions.

 6. Relying on Boahen, in his written submissions, Mr George appears to  be
    saying that the Respondent's grounds are  a  'misconstruction'  of  the
    Notice at best and 'misconception' at worst because for there to  be  a
    cancellation based on a change of circumstances,  the  change  must  be
    permanent  and  the  burden  of  proof  was  'a  very  high  degree  of
    probability'.

    The Hearing

    At the hearing, I handed to the parties copies of Rule 321A (1) and 322
    (12) for ease of reference and for context.

 7. In submissions, Mr Kandola relied on the  grounds  of  application.  He
    stated that the  Judge  had  made  a  mistake  as  to  fact  (that  the
    cancellation was under Rule 322 (12) when it was  in  fact  under  321A
    (1)) and this had resulted in a material error of law. He  stated  that
    the provision under which leave  was  cancelled  was  set  out  in  the
    explanatory statement that was attached to the Notice  and  Mr  Kandola
    sought to adduce it in evidence. He stated that there was  a  Court  of
    Appeal authority, E and R, for which he did not  have  a  citation  but
    which confirmed that where there had been a mistake  as  to  fact,  and
    there was document is objective and the issues could  be  independently
    verifiable, then it could be adduced in evidence. He submitted that the
    document he was seeking to adduce  originated  from  the  Secretary  of
    State and referred to the Immigration Rules  and  therefore  should  be
    admitted. He submitted that the  error  of  law  was  material  to  the
    outcome because had the Judge known that  the  cancellation  was  under
    paragraph 321A (1), he would have reached a different decision.

 8. Mr Kandola was in fact referring to is E and R [2004] EWCA  Civ  49  in
    which the Court of Appeal stated that "a mistake of fact giving rise to
    unfairness is a separate head of challenge in an appeal on a  point  of
    law..." and when assessing whether or not to exercise the discretion to
    admit new evidence, "...the principle of finality would  be  important.
    To justify reopening the case,  the  IAT  would  normally  need  to  be
    satisfied that there was  a  risk  of  serious  injustice,  because  of
    something which had gone  wrong  at  the  hearing,  or  some  important
    evidence which had been overlooked; and in considering whether to admit
    new evidence, it should  be  guided  by  Ladd  v  Marshall  principles,
    subject to any exceptional factors" (paragraph 92 (iii)).

 9. Even applying the Ladd v Marshall principles the explanatory  statement
    is not admissible at this stage because it does  not  comply  with  the
    first of the three requirements  (it  is  a  document  which  with  due
    diligence could have been supplied to the First-tier Tribunal), even if
    it does comply with the other two (the evidence contained within it  is
    apparently true and  it  is  capable  of  making  a  material,  if  not
    decisive, difference to the outcome).

10. Mr  Kandola  stated  that  even  if  I  cannot  admit  the  explanatory
    statement, it was clear from the Notice (form IS.H2C)  that  the  leave
    was cancelled due to a change in circumstances.

11. As to the submissions contained within the skeleton argument, the first
    was that cancellation of leave could  only  be  based  on  a  permanent
    change of circumstances. However, this was  not  supported  Boahen.  In
    that case, the Court of Appeal considered whether a permanent change of
    circumstances was required before leave could be cancelled  under  Rule
    231A(1) and it was found that it was not. At head note 2 it was stated

           "The  immigration  judge  had  been  entitled   to   cancel   the
         respondent's  leave  to  enter  on  the  ground  of  a  change   of
         circumstances under 321A (1) of the Immigration Rules. The  learned
         judge had drawn from the Immigration Directorate's Instructions  to
         its  staff  a  principle  as  to  the  permanence  of  the   change
         contemplated by the rule  and  had  concluded  if  the  change  was
         comprised in alteration of the purpose of the visit in the mind  of
         the visitor, it would be a change which qualified  under  paragraph
         321A (1) only if the material  persuades  the  immigration  officer
         that there is now a permanent desire, or permanent intention not to
         use the visit visa for proper visits, but only for visits which are
         going to be in breach of the  terms  of  the  visits.  However,  no
         principle of permanence can be drawn from  those  instructions.  It
         cannot have been the purpose of  the  legislation  to  require  the
         immigration officer to be satisfied that the intention of the  visa
         holder was never again during the period of validity of the visa to
         make a visit for the purpose for which the visa was granted."

12. Therefore, the fact that the Appellant  was  willing  to  pay  the  NHS
    charge, so that it may not be a permanent change in circumstances,  did
    not affect materiality.

13. Mr George relied on  the  skeleton  argument.  He  submitted  that  the
    explanatory statement should have been provided to the  Judge  and  was
    not. I pointed out that Mr Kandola was  in  fact  saying  even  in  the
    absence of the explanatory statement that the terms of the Notice  were
    clear. Mr George than submitted that paragraph 321A (i), as referred to
    in the grounds of application, did not exist. However,  although  there
    had clearly been a typographical error it was clear that the  reference
    to paragraph 321A (i) was in fact a reference to  paragraph  321A  (1).
    His submissions then were:

          a. When reading the terms of the Notice, as set  out  above,  the
             wording "...you owe more than �12,000 to the North East London
             NHS  Treatment  Centre  in  accordance   with   the   relevant
             regulations on charges to overseas visitors..." as  the  'main
             clause' and the wording "... I am  satisfied  that  there  has
             been a significant change of circumstances  since  your  entry
             clearance was issued" was the sub clause  and  the  Judge  was
             therefore not wrong to have relied on paragraph 322(12).

          b. Referring to paragraph 11 of Palisetty, he submitted that  the
             burden of proof was on the  Respondent  and  the  standard  of
             proof was 'a high degree of probability' and he invited me not
             to admit the new evidence;

          c. To cancel leave under paragraph 322A (1) the Respondent  would
             have to establish that the change was permanent,  as  provided
             at paragraph 8 of  Boahen,  and  at  paragraph  37,  that  the
             intention of the Appellant was  relevant.  The  NHS  treatment
             could not  amount  to  a  permanent  change  of  circumstances
             because the evidence before the Judge was that the Appellant's
             family had offered to  pay  it.  The  Appellant  had  required
             urgent medical treatment which had resulted in the charges;

          d. The preamble to paragraph 322 (12) confirmed  that  that  this
             was the correct provision; it  is  headed  "Grounds  on  which
             leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or  remain  in
             the  United  Kingdom  should  normally  be  refused"  and  the
             reference to NHS charges is set out in paragraph 322 (12). The
             Notice clearly set out the terms of paragraph 322 (12) and  it
             was open to the Judge to apply it.

14. Mr Kandola submitted that the issue was very narrow. It  was  that  the
    Judge relied on the wrong Immigration Rule. The  facts  were  accepted;
    the Appellant accepted that she had incurred �12,000  of  NHS  charges.
    The Court of Appeal had rejected the  permanence  argument;  the  court
    stated "It is legitimate to ask whether, if the entry clearance officer
    had known that the applicant would use the visa for purposes other than
    those authorised, whether mistakenly or  deliberately,  he  would  have
    issued it" (paragraph 37). If the ECO had known that the Appellant  had
    incurred �12,000 worth of NHS charges, he would  not  have  issued  the
    visa.

15. Mr Kandola asked that if I find there had been a material error of law,
    I  admit  the  explanatory  statement.  Paragraph  321A  (1)  was  non-
    discretionary and the appeal therefore fell to be dismissed.

16. Both parties agreed that if I found that the Judge had materially erred
    in law I had sufficient material before me to remake the decision.

    Decision and reasons

17. For the purposes of my decision, I do not in fact  need  to  admit  any
    additional evidence. I find, as submitted by Mr Kandola, that the  visa
    was cancelled due to a change in the Appellant's circumstances. This is
    the plain and ordinary meaning of the  text  set  out  at  paragraph  2
    above. It cannot be artificially construed by references  to  main  and
    sub-clauses. The basis of the cancellation is set out at the beginning,
    the reason is given as the NHS charges and the result is that leave  is
    cancelled.

18. Dealing with the reference to NHS charges, Mr George  stated  that  the
    Appellant had needed  urgent  NHS  treatment,  which  resulted  in  the
    charges. However, it is clear from  the  witness  statements  submitted
    that the Appellant had an asthma attack for which she  required  urgent
    treatment but thereafter due to pains in her knees and  related  follow
    up she had two knee replacements and associated treatment.  This  could
    not be classified as 'urgent' treatment. Whilst  NHS  charges  are  not
    referred to in paragraph 321A (1), the fact that the Appellant received
    NHS treatment when she came to the UK as visitor is evidence  that  the
    purpose of her entry to the UK was not solely  as  a  visitor.  If  she
    required treatment, an application should have been made as  a  medical
    visitor with the appropriate evidence.  Therefore,  strictly  speaking,
    the reason for the cancellation was that the NHS charges were  evidence
    of a change of circumstances rather than a reason for cancellation.

19. There is no merit in  Mr  George's  submission  that  the  preamble  to
    paragraph 322 (12) supported the Judge's reliance on that provision. It
    refers to 'leave to remain' and 'variation of leave to enter or remain'
    which is made when the Appellant is in the UK and  to  the  application
    'being refused'. The Appellant was not seeking leave to remain, nor was
    she seeking a 'variation of leave to enter or remain'. Furthermore,  an
    application she had made was not  'being  refused'.  In  contrast,  the
    heading for paragraph 321A (1) reads, "Grounds on which leave to  enter
    or remain which is in force is to be cancelled at  port  or  where  the
    holder is outside the United Kingdom". Her visa  was  cancelled  before
    she was allowed to enter the UK. It  was  clear  that  the  Appellant's
    leave was 'cancelled';  this  is  clearly  stated  in  the  Notice  and
    cancellation cannot take place under paragraph 322 (12).

20. There is no merit  in  Mr  George's  submission  that  the  immigration
    officer needed to demonstrate a permanent change in circumstances.  The
    parts of Boahen he referred to were taken from the determination of the
    Judge whose decision was the subject  of  the  proceedings  before  the
    Court of Appeal. On a full reading of the judgement, it cannot be  said
    that a permanent change of circumstances needed to  be  established  or
    that the Appellant's intention was relevant.

21. As to the need to  prove  the  change  in  circumstances  (without  any
    reliance on Palisetty, which in fact relates to the burden of proof  in
    cases of unlawful detention)  under  part  9,  it  is  always  for  the
    Respondent to prove. However, the facts of  the  case  (i.e.  that  NHS
    charges  had  been  incurred)  were  not  in  dispute  and  there  had,
    therefore, been a relevant change in circumstances.

22. I find that the Judge did  err  in  determining  the  Appellant's  case
    against the provisions of paragraph 322 (12) of the  Immigration  Rules
    and that this error was material. I have considered whether relying  on
    the wrong Immigration Rule had the effect of prejudicing the  Appellant
    if I were to go on to remake the decision. I find it does  not  because
    the underlying facts of the  case  are  clear.  She  had  two  surgical
    procedures (one in February 2012 and the other in February 2013 as  per
    the witness statement of her son dated 21 July 2014). It  is  therefore
    clear that the Appellant received treatment over a considerable  period
    of time and at no time sought to change the basis of her  stay  in  the
    UK. Even if the case were remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  there
    could only be one outcome; the appeal would be  dismissed  because  the
    provisions of paragraph 321A (1) are not discretionary.

23. I therefore remake the decision to dismiss the appeal.

    Decision

24. It follows from the above that there is a material error of law in  the
    decision of Judge Onoufriou. I set aside his  decision.  I  remake  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

    Anonymity

25. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I see
    no reason why an order should be  made  pursuant  to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
