For the Appellant: No appearance
For the Respondent: Miss R Petterson (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The First Appellant applied for a residence card as the spouse of an EEA
   national exercising treaty rights in the UK. The Second Appellant does
   not appear to have a relevant immigration decision.

2. The Appellants' case was considered by First-tier Tribunal Judge Law at
   Arnhem House on the 27th of February 2014. On the basis that the
   Appellants had not provided the immigration decision to which the appeal
   related the appeals were dismissed.

3. The Appellants sought permission to appeal on the basis that they had
   faxed in the relevant documentation ahead of the consideration of the
   appeal. It was clear to First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox who granted
   permission that through no fault of Judge Laws the papers referred to had
   been faxed to the Tribunal but had reached the file after the appeal had
   been dismissed. On that basis permission was granted.

4. It is clear that the Appellants did send in the required information
   ahead of their appeals being considered by the First-tier Tribunal,
   through an administrative error the Appellants' papers were not filed as
   required with the First-tier Tribunal file. Technically this is an error
   although there is no fault attached to the Judge but in the circumstances
   the appeal has to be allowed and the appeals remitted to the First-tier
   Tribunal for full consideration. That includes a decision on the validity
   of the appeal of the Second Appellant.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

The appeals of the Appellants are remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at
Arnhem House with all issues remaining open for consideration.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

I make no fee order as that is a matter to be considered by the First-tier
Tribunal.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
