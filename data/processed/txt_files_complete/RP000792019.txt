For the Respondent:    Ms Ferguson


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the 'respondent' and  the  respondent
    as the 'appellant', as they appeared respectively before the First-tier
    Tribunal. The appellant was born in 1984 and is a citizen of  Iraq.  He
    appealed against a decision of the Secretary of  State  dated  31  July
    2019 to revoke his refugee status which had been granted on 31 December
    2012.  On   27   April   2018,   the   appellant   was   convicted   of
    acquisition/use/possession of criminal property and possession of Class
    A  drugs  and  sentenced  to  prison  for  10  months  and  33   months
    respectively, the sentences to run concurrently.  He  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal, which in a decision promulgated on 23 March  2020,
    allowed  the  appeal.  The  Secretary  of  State  now   appeals,   with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. There appeals proceeds on Grounds 2 and 3 only; Ground 1 is  no  longer
    pursued. The judge correctly summarised his task in the appeal at [20];
    to determine whether the appellant had been convicted of a particularly
    serious crime and, secondly, whether  he  would  be  a  danger  to  the
    community in the United Kingdom (see paragraph  339AC  of  HC  395  (as
    amended) and section 72 of the 2002 Act). He concluded  [24]  that  the
    appellant had been convicted of a particularly serious crime.  However,
    he found [26-30] that the appellant did not constitute a danger to  the
    community.

 3. The judge acknowledged that the appellant had  been  unemployed  for  7
    months after leaving prison and that that his failure to find work  may
    increase the likelihood that he would  re-offend.  At  [28]  the  judge
    identified a clear link between the appellant finding secure employment
    and the risk of his committing further economically-motivated offences.
    That observation was  made  against  the  background  of  the  Offender
    Manager's evidence  that,  whilst  the  danger  of  the  appellant  re-
    offending was low, he still represented a medium risk of  harm  to  the
    general  public.  The  judge  made  no  findings  on  the   appellant's
    contention that he would be able to find work as a lifeguard or an Uber
    driver; in the absence of evidence, the judge appears to concluded that
    such findings would amount to speculation [28]. Mr Tan who appeared for
    the Secretary of State  before  the  Upper  Tribunal,  submitted  that,
    notwithstanding  that  observation,  the   judge   then   reached   the
    speculative and somewhat vague finding that the appellant would be able
    to find employment 'within  a  reasonable  period  of  time'  and  that
    'therefore the risk  of  economically-motivated  further  offending  is
    limited'. I agree with Mr Tan that the judge's conclusion does not  sit
    easily with his reluctance to make findings in the absence of evidence.
    I agree also that  'within  a  reasonable  period  of  time'  fails  to
    determine the period of time during which the appellant may pose a risk
    to the community. Moreover, whilst clearly attaching importance to  the
    appellant's ability to find work, the judge does not address  the  fact
    that the appellant committed the index offences at a time when  he  was
    working and earning ï¿½30,000 per annum. The reasoning is opaque and  the
    analysis flawed in consequence.

 4. I also find that Ground 3 has merit. At  [29],  the  judge  found  that
    prison had come as a 'big shock'  to  the  appellant,  the  implication
    being it was an experience he would not wish to  repeat.  That  finding
    may have some value but the finding in  the  same  paragraph  that  the
    opinion that the appellant was at low risk of re-offending  because  he
    had undertaken courses in prison is much more difficult to justify.  As
    the Secretary of State points out, it is unclear why the completion  of
    courses such as  a  'Vitality  Group  Workshop'  or  'Personal  Finance
    Certificate' would necessarily indicate that the appellant's propensity
    to offend again had diminished.

 5. I find that the judge's analysis is unclear and that  the  decision  is
    vitiated by legal error. I set aside the decision. More than a year has
    elapsed since the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  and  further  fact-
    finding may be required before the decision  is  remade.  Consequently,
    the appeal is returned to the First-tier Tribunal for that Tribunal  to
    remake the decision after a hearing. The finding (which  has  not  been
    challenged by the appellant) that the  appellant  was  convicted  of  a
    particularly serious offence is preserved. All other findings  are  set
    aside.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. Save as stated at  [5]
above, the findings are set aside. The appeal  is  returned  the  First-tier
Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the decision.
