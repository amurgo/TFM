Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms F Allen of Counsel instructed by Owens Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is  a  citizen  of  Ghana.   He
    claims to have entered the UK illegally in March 2007, aged 32, with no
    valid visa.  In 2007 he met MA and in 2011 formed a  relationship  with
    MA. Their relationship bore a son, N, born in August 2013.   MA  and  N
    have Discretionary Leave to Remain until 31 July 2018.  R is a  British
    citizen with a different father.  MA now has  another  child,  E.   The
    claimant's relationship broke down shortly after N was born and his son
    lives with MA.  Despite initial difficulties in  agreeing  access,  the
    couple agreed through a Family Mediation in March  2015  that  N  would
    continue living with his mother and his half-sister, R, born  in  2010,
    but would have  overnight  contact  with  his  father  every  alternate
    weekend as well  as  seeing  him  during  the  week  on  two  or  three
    afternoons.  On 2 April 2015 the claimant applied for leave  to  remain
    on the basis of his family life in the UK with A.  In this  application
    he stated that he had separated from MA but that even  though  MA  only
    had temporary leave to remain in  the  UK,  it  was  not  in  N's  best
    interests for the claimant to be removed and separated from  N.   On  4
    June 2015 the respondent refused his application on the basis  that  he
    did not qualify under the  Immigration  Rules  and  he  had  not  shown
    exceptional circumstances to warrant  a  grant  of  leave  outside  the
    Rules,  one  reason  being  that  his  removal  would  not  result   in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences.

2.   The claimant appealed and in a decision sent on  7  March  2016  First-
    tier Tribunal (FtT)  Judge  Lodge  allowed  his  appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds.  The appellant (hereafter the  Secretary  of  State  or  SSHD)
    appealed and on 20 October 2016 I issued a decision setting  aside  FtT
    Judge Lodge's decision for error of law.

3.   In  summary  I  found  that  the  judge  had  erred:  in  conducting  a
    simplistic assessment of the best interests of the child that  did  not
    involve a balancing of factors; in considering that denying a child the
    presence of his father was  per  se  disproportionate;  in  failing  to
    attach significant weight to the fact that the claimant  did  not  meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules (see SS (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 387); and in failing to consider that under both s117B(4)  of  NIAA
    2002 in relation to his private life ties and under  the  jurisprudence
    on Article 8 at large (see Rajendran (s117B - family life) [2016]  UKUT
    138 (IAC), little weight should be attached to relationships formed  at
    a time when a person's immigration status is precarious.  In the course
    of analysing the evidence before the FtT Judge I stated at [6] and  [7]
    that:

         "6.  ... I find it particularly striking that  the  judge  appeared
             not to weigh in the balance at all the  fact  he  recorded  at
             [10] as follows:

             '10. He was asked what he  would  do  if  the  child's  mother
                  decided to return to Ghana.  He said that if she went back
                  he would stay here in the UK.  He  was  pressed  again  on
                  this point.  He said he just wanted to stay here in the UK
                  and would not return to Ghana even if the child went  back
                  with his mother'.

         7.   By stating that it was more important for him to stay  in  the
             UK than maintain a relationship in the same country  with  his
             child, the claimant demonstrated that  his  relationship  with
             his child was secondary to his own immigration concerns.   His
             is not a case, I note, where there is no (sic)  issue  of  him
             facing risk on return to Ghana."


4.   Having observed that there was no particular factual dispute about  the
    extent of the claimant's contact with his child, I  decided  to  retain
    the case in the Upper Tribunal  with  a  direction  that  the  claimant
    produce a report from an independent child professional relating to the
    circumstances of the child (to include the  child's  relationship  with
    his half-sibling).

5.   In time for the resumed hearing the claimant produced a report from  an
    independent social worker, Philip Kent, dated  24  November  2016.   He
    visited MA and N in her house and the claimant and N in his.  He  noted
    that N had been attending nursery since September and that the claimant
    picks N up from nursery on Mondays,  Tuesdays  and  Wednesdays  in  the
    afternoon  and  returns  him  to  MA  late  afternoon.   The   claimant
    contributes ï¿½120 a month.  N also spends about  two  weekends  a  month
    living with the claimant, however, this is a flexible arrangement.   Mr
    Kent found that the relationship between the claimant is a  loving  one
    and that it is very important to N: R also sees the claimant as a dad:

         "[N] has a strong relationship with both parents.  If he was denied
         a physical relationship with his father his  development  could  be
         compromised.   Considering  his   mother   has   had   considerable
         difficulties in maintaining long-term relationships and his  father
         appears to be the one constant adult  male  in  the  life  of  this
         family, Ms [MA] informed me that her other children also view  [the
         claimant] to be their father."

6.   Mr Kent concluded that it was his view, based on his observations,

         "that [N] needs his father for healthy development.  [The claimant]
         is an important figure in [N's] life and.... it  would  be  to  his
         detriment if [the claimant] were to be physically removed from  his
         life... Considering Article 8, it would  seem  that  removing  [the
         claimant] would be in contravention to N's rights and  welfare.   I
         therefore recommend that [the claimant] be allowed to remain in the
         UK."


7.   The claimant also produced an updated witness statement of  9  December
    2016 stating that:

         "1.  At the hearing of my appeal at  the  [FtT]  the  then  Officer
             asked me if I would return to Ghana if my son's mother    were
             to return and I said no.  I wish to state that I was extremely
             nervous at the hearing and this reflected in the answer that I
             gave.  My reasoning for saying no was not because  I  am  only
             interested in the UK without my son,  this  is  far  from  it.
             Rather I thought that the question was about my  son's  mother
             and her other children moving to Ghana and  since  I  was  not
             married to his mother, I would remain in the UK with  my  son.
             I certainly wish to be with my son wherever  he  is  as  I  am
             committed to be there for him as he grows up.


         2.   I am also committed to my son's half-siblings who see me as  a
             father figure.  I have been playing a vital role in  the  life
             of R, who is my son's half-sister.  R spends time with me on a
             regular basis and she now calls me 'Dad'."

8.   At the resumed hearing before me Ms Allen said that  the  claimant  was
    entitled to rely on Article 8 because there was  no  provision  in  the
    Rules for parents of children with limited leave.  The claimant's  case
    had sharply to be distinguished from cases where the family unit  could
    be expected to leave the UK together.  There was no suggestion  MA  and
    her three children including N  should  uproot  themselves  and  go  to
    Ghana.  She and the claimant do not live together and  do  not  have  a
    relationship.

9.   So the issue was whether it was proportionate to separate  father  from
    son when it was in the latter's best interests to have  his  father  in
    his life.  Hence, issues such as whether the child's best interests lay
    here or in Ghana given linguistic, cultural and family support networks
    were irrelevant.   The  SSHD's  refusal  letter  completely  failed  to
    consider  the  claimant's  relationship  with  N.   It  was  especially
    important in the claimant's case to recall the guidance  given  by  the
    Supreme Court to the effect that a parent's immigration wrongdoings are
    not to be visited on the child.  The independent social  worker  report
    bore out that the claimant had been a constant figure in N's life since
    he was born and that to remove the claimant could risk N's development.
     Contact could not be maintained in any real sense if the  claimant  is
    removed to Ghana.  Sections 117A-D of the NIAA 2002 contained very  few
    considerations relevant to the  claimant's  case:  the  claimant  spoke
    English; he was not  financially  independent  as  he  was  reliant  on
    friends here; he was relying on family life, not private life; N is not
    a qualifying child.  Any contact with N is very dependent on  MA's  co-
    operation; the current  arrangements  were  agreed  only  after  Family
    Mediation.  The claimant was not asking for ILR, just leave to coincide
    with N's which ran until July 2018.  The claimant was also an important
    figure in the life of R, N's half-sibling and would be for E.

10.  Ms Fijiwala said that the SSHD's refusal  decision  was  proportionate.
    It was accepted in this case that the claimant enjoyed family life with
    N, but that still left the issue of proportionality.   As  regards  the
    best interests of the child, clearly it is best if a child  is  brought
    up by both parents but N's primary carer has always been MA and he  had
    always lived his mother's home.  N has important relationships with two
    half-siblings.

11.  It was against this background, submitted Ms Fijiwala, that the  public
    interest considerations had to be weighed.  The claimant could not meet
    the requirements of the Rules; he had an appalling immigration history:
    he had never made application to regularise his stay until N was  born.
    The claimant's purported explanation in his updated  witness  statement
    as to why he had said he would remain in the UK if MA and her son  went
    to Ghana made no sense.  Whilst s117(4) and (5)  only  required  little
    weight in certain circumstances to be attached to  a  person's  private
    life, the precarious nature of immigration status was also relevant  to
    family life and it was  a  factor  that  the  claimant  had  begun  his
    relationship with MA when his immigration status was  precarious.   The
    claimant was not financially independent and if he provides money to MA
    for N it was not his money.  If the claimant remains in the UK he would
    be a burden on the state: he had provided no  specific  explanation  of
    how he covers his accommodation and  day-to-day  expenses.   Whilst  of
    course indirect contact with his child from Ghana would not be the best
    option for the child, MA  had  been  to  Ghana  and  contact  could  be
    maintained through Skype etc.  MA only has DLR  so  there  was  a  real
    possibility she may have to return to Ghana in any event.   There  were
    no compelling circumstances in the claimant's case.

12.  In response, Ms Allen reiterated points she  made  earlier,  explaining
    that this was a case in which the SSHD accepts  that  the  child  would
    remain in the UK.  If MA and N are not granted further leave to  remain
    after July 2018, the claimant accepts he should not get further leave.

My Decision

The Rules

13.  It is accepted by  Ms  Allen  that  the  claimant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules but she avers that this is because the  Rules
    have a lacuna in that they do not cover the  situation  of  fathers  of
    children who have limited leave.  It is not clear to me why this should
    be regarded as a lacuna.  The contents of the  Rules  is  a  matter  of
    policy for the executive and parliament and if they fail to incorporate
    Article 8 safeguards in  every  respect,  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998
    functions to protect their situation.

Best interests of the child

14.  The claimant's case is  predominantly  put  on  the  footing  that  his
    removal would be disproportionate because it would be contrary  to  the
    best interests of his son, N.   Ms  Allen  contends  that  because  the
    claimant's case is not one in which there is any  issue  of  the  child
    being expected to  accompany  the  father  to  his  country  of  origin
    (Ghana), - it is not a case where one considers the relative  strengths
    of linguistic, cultural and familial ties in the country of  origin  as
    compared to the UK.  I consider she is right about that, but that  does
    not mean I accept that the decision was disproportionate.

15.   In assessing the best interests of N, I would accept  that  considered
    overall his best interests are on balance to have his father remain  in
    the UK as part of his life.  That has  been  confirmed  by  the  recent
    report from the independent social worker, Mr Kent.  It is a remiss  of
    Mr Kent to attempt at the end of his report to venture his own  opinion
    of what the Human Rights  Act  entails  in  the  claimant's  case;  his
    opinion was sought as to the child's welfare, not his own  views  about
    how the law should be applied  and  interpreted.   Nevertheless,  I  am
    prepared to treat this as a lapse of judgment that has  not  undermined
    the reliability of his factual observations and his evaluation  of  N's
    circumstances.  In his opinion  N's  development  would  be  negatively
    affected by the claimant's departure and N would lose the  only  stable
    father figure in his life presently.

16.  At the same time, the claimant's departure  would  not  wholly  nullify
    the child's best interests.  N would continue to be in the  same  house
    and be brought up by the same primary carer he has now, his mother, MA.
     The claimant has never been involved in N's life  as  a  father  in  a
    nuclear family, living in the same household and  sharing  the  primary
    care of the child nor has the claimant ever been a parent going out  to
    work to support his family.  Although he presently gives ï¿½120 a  month,
    that is not money he has earned, simply money  friends  have  given  to
    him.  Hence, although N's best  interests  would  be  impaired  by  the
    claimant's departure, they would not be nullified and in the most basic
    respects, in terms of provision to him of  primary  care  in  a  stable
    household, would be unaffected.

17.  This qualified finding as  regards  N's  best  interests  must  now  be
    carried over into the assessment of the proportionality of the decision
    to remove the claimant.  It is shown in this  case  that  the  claimant
    enjoys family life with his son within the meaning  of  Article  8  and
    that the decision to remove him is an  interference  with  this  family
    life.

18.  In assessing proportionality, I take into  account  in  the  claimant's
    favour that he has lived in the UK for over eight years, speaks English
    and has a network of friends.  From the account he  has  given  of  his
    history he may have held valid hopes he could study in  the  UK  as  an
    engineer but that did not happen because of  his  brother's  death.   I
    also take into account in his favour that even though his  relationship
    with MA has broken down he has retained contact with their son,  N  and
    has developed a loving relationship with him and he has regular contact
    with N several days a  week  and  on  alternative  weekends  that  also
    involves N staying with him.  I accept that if the claimant is removed,
    N's development will be negatively affected.   Also,  weighing  in  the
    claimant's favour is that he has sought to take an interest in MA's two
    other children, the oldest, R, who calls him dad.

19.  I consider, however, that  these  factors  are  heavily  outweighed  by
    factors counting  against  the  claimant.   The  claimant  has  a  poor
    immigration history and did not take steps to regularise  his  position
    until several years after he arrived in the UK illegally.  He did enjoy
    family life for a period of time with  MA  but  that  relationship  was
    entered into when he knew his immigration status was  precarious.   The
    claimant is not financially independent.

20.  This is not a case where the other parent of the  child  concerned  has
    citizenship or settled status in the UK.  MA has DLR until August  2018
    and she does have a B C daughter, but her  own  immigration  status  is
    precarious and it cannot be assumed her leave will be extended further.
     Put another way, the claimant's strength of connections with the UK is
    weak  and  on the mother's side they are also contingent.

21.  I have already found that on balance the best interests of  the  child,
    N, lay with having the claimant continue to be part of his life, but as
    already noted, N's best interests will continue in most respects to  be
    unaffected because he will still have the same primary carer  and  live
    in the same household.  As regards the claimant's feelings for N, I  am
    entirely satisfied they are genuine and the independent  social  worker
    has vouchsafed the strength of the claimant's bond with N.  At the same
    time, I cannot ignore that in the wider scheme of things, the  claimant
    was quite clear at the time of the hearing  before  the  FtT  judge  in
    November 2015 that even if N went with his  mother  to  Ghana  he  (the
    claimant) would seek  to  stay  in  the  UK.   In  an  updated  witness
    statement the claimant has sought to explain this statement  by  saying
    that it was said out of nervousness and because he thought the question
    was about MA and the other children moving  to  Ghana.   However,  that
    interpretation is inconsistent with the record of his evidence made  by
    the FtT judge and it is quite clear from the Record of Proceedings that
    the claimant was being asked about the scenario of MS  going  to  Ghana
    with N.

22.  As regards the claimant's ties with R and the newborn E, E  is  clearly
    too small to see the claimant as a father figure.   I  am  prepared  to
    accept that R, however, does see him as a  father  figure,  but  it  is
    equally clear that the claimant  has  very  limited  possibilities  for
    spending time with her as he does not live with her and when he  has  N
    with him R is not with them.  Although  the  claimant  asserts  in  his
    updated witness statement  that "R spends time with  me  on  a  regular
    basis" there is no mention of that in the independent  social  worker's
    report and no suggestion by the  claimant  hitherto  that  he  had  any
    contact with R except when dropping N back home or picking him up.

23.  Ms Allen has submitted that this  appeal  is  not  concerned  with  the
    situation where the child involved  could  reasonably  be  expected  to
    accompany the claimant to his country of  origin  or  that  the  mother
    could reasonably be expected to return to live  near  the  claimant  so
    that  he  could  continue  to  enjoy  the  same  contact   and   access
    arrangements he has presently.  That is correct, but it is  a  relevant
    consideration nonetheless that if the mother  of  the  child  concerned
    believes it is central to the child's best interests that  he  continue
    close contact with the claimant, then, it is open to her to  return  to
    Ghana to ensure that, and indeed she has no legitimate  expectation  of
    remaining in the UK for more  than  another  year  or  so.   She  is  a
    national of Ghana and has been back to Ghana for a visit in the  recent
    past.

24.  Weighing all relevant factors for and against the claimant, I  conclude
    that the decision of the SSHD was a proportionate one and that it would
    not be contrary to his Article 8 rights to remove him to Ghana.

     To conclude:

    It has already been found that the FtT judge materially  erred  in  law
    and his decision has been set aside.


    The decision I re-make is to dismiss the claimant's appeal.


No anonymity direction is made.
