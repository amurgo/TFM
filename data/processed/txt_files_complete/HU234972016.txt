For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Grant made
    following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 20th September 2018.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Senegal born on 6th  November  1975.   He
    arrived in the UK in 2009.  In 2016 he applied for leave to  remain  in
    the UK under the  ten  year  parent  route  and  was  refused  on  22nd
    September 2016 on the grounds that the  respondent  was  not  satisfied
    that he was in a parental relationship with a qualifying child and  did
    not meet any of the other requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The judge recorded that the appellant and his partner had separated for
    some  of  the  year  2016.   She  said  that  the  resumption  of   the
    relationship between the parties was a new matter and the Secretary  of
    State did not consent to raising it at the hearing.

 4. She did however  accept  that  the  appellant  was  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with his daughter.  Nevertheless,  she
    dismissed the appeal holding it to be proportionate for  the  appellant
    to return to make an application for entry clearance or for his partner
    and their daughter to live in Senegal with the appellant.

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had conducted a legally flawed consideration of paragraph EX.1  and  in
    relation to Article 8 of the ECHR outside the Immigration Rules.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Povey on 25th October 2018.

 7. Mrs Pettersen, for the respondent, accepted that the judge had erred in
    law and did not seek to argue that the decision should not be reversed.

Findings and Conclusions

 8. At paragraph 14 the judge wrote:-

         "In human rights appeals I must consider the  position  as  at  the
         date of hearing.   The  appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with his daughter but she is not  a  qualifying  child
         because she has not lived in the UK for more than seven years.  She
         is 4 years old."

 9. The appellant's daughter is however a British citizen and therefore not
    required to  have  lived  in  the  UK  for  seven  years.   Accordingly
    paragraph EX.1 ought to have been applied.

10. Paragraph EX.1 states that this paragraph applies if:-

         "(a) (i)      the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a child who -

                  (aa) is under the age of 18 years or was under the age  of
                      18 years when the applicant was first  granted  leave
                      on the basis that this paragraph applied;

                  (bb) is in the UK;

                  (cc)  is  a  British  citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                      continuously for at least the seven years immediately
                      preceding the date of application; and

             (ii) taking into account their best  interests  as  a  primary
                  consideration, it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the
                  child to leave the UK."

11.  Paragraph  117B  of  the  2002  Act  sets  out  the  public   interest
    considerations in all cases concerning Article 8 of the ECHR.

12. The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the  public
    interest.  The appellant does not have extant leave to  remain  in  the
    UK.

13. So far as Section 117B(2) is concerned, he speaks fluent  English  and,
    in relation to 117B(3) is financially independent.  Whilst  he  is  not
    able to work his wife is  a  qualified  staff  nurse  employed  at  the
    Sheffield Teaching Hospitals and earns a salary of ï¿½23,363 per year.

14. However  his relationship with his wife should be given  little  weight
    since the evidence suggests that it was formed at a point when  he  had
    no leave to be in the UK.

15.  The  most  relevant  paragraph  here  is  117B(6)  which  mirrors  the
    requirement set out in the Immigration Rules in relation to children.

16. It is not contested by the respondent that the appellant has a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with his British citizen daughter.

17. Mrs Pettersen accepted that the Home Office's own guidance  cases  such
    as this, not involving criminality, must  always  be  assessed  on  the
    basis that it would be unreasonable to expect a British  citizen  child
    to leave the EU with his or her parent or primary carer.

18. It was not  the  Home  Office's  policy  to  argue  that  it  would  be
    proportionate to expect the appellant to return to  Senegal  to  obtain
    entry clearance.  In this case  the  suitability  and  eligibility  and
    financial requirements were met and to do so  would  seriously  disrupt
    family life in the UK.

19. In MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that
    first there has to be a careful assessment of the best interests of the
    child and then a decision has to  be  made  whether  any  other  public
    interests in play have the effect  of  displacing  it.   In  cases  not
    involving criminality strong reasons are required to  depart  following
    the child's best interests.

20. Mrs Pettersen did not seek  to  argue  that  any  such  strong  reasons
    existed here.

21. Accordingly, the appellant meets the requirements of paragraph EX.1.

Notice of Decision
