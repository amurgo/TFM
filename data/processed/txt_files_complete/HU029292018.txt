For the Respondent:    Mrs Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  of  the
    First tier Tribunal Moan dated 16 April 2019 dismissing the appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the  respondent  dated  8  January  2018
    refusing her human rights claim.

2     The appellant is a national of India, and at the time of  the  judge's
    decision was 69 years old. She entered the United Kingdom  on  25  July
    2016 with entry clearance as a visitor. It was common ground before the
    judge that the appellant's husband, with whom she had lived  alone  for
    many years, had died in June 2016. Her children had gone to  India  and
    had taken the appellant back with them to the United Kingdom.

3     The appellant made an application for leave to remain on human  rights
    grounds on 8 August 2017, asserting that she should be granted leave to
    remain in the United Kingdom to respect  her  rights  under  Article  8
    ECHR,  and relying upon paragraph 276ADE(1) of the  immigration  rules,
    asserting that in her new-found circumstances as a widow, the appellant
    would not be able to integrate into life in India. The  appellant  made
    reference to various health problems.

4     The respondent refused the  application  for  leave  to  remain  on  8
    January 2018, finding that there were no very significant obstacles  to
    the appellant's integration into India, given that she spoke Punjabi, a
    local language, and had lived in  India  for  66  years  prior  to  her
    entering the United Kingdom,  including  her  childhood  and  formative
    years. It was noted that the appellant had been living in the  UK  with
    members of her family for approximately one year but all were over  the
    age of 18. The respondent referred to a  GP  letter  stating  that  the
    appellant had been diagnosed with depression and needed help with daily
    tasks such as washing and dressing and that the appellant suffered pain
    in her shoulders. The respondent also referred to a psychiatric  report
    dated 27 February 2017 (from a Dr Krishma Jethwa)  which  set  out  her
    medical  history  of  arthritis,  diabetes,  strokes   in   the   past,
    hypercholesterolaemia, and severe depressive episode due  to  low  mood
    swings following her late husband's death. The  respondent  noted  that
    the appellant had stated that she was being  financially  supported  by
    family and friends in the UK,  and  it  was  asserted  that  there  was
    nothing preventing them from continuing to do this from the UK  if  the
    appellant were removed to India.

5     The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision,  the  appeal
    being heard only on 1 April 2019, i.e. some considerable period of time
    after the respondent's decision. By then,  there  was  also  a  further
    report dated 7 March 2019 from  Dr  Jethwa  regarding  the  appellant's
    health, and commenting specifically on her capacity to act on  her  own
    behalf in the  appeal  proceedings,  finding  that  she  did  not  have
    capacity to  conduct  the  proceedings.  Dr  Jethwa  also  completed  a
    certificate as to capacity to conduct proceedings, confirming that  the
    appellant  lacked  such  capacity.  A  certificate  of  suitability  of
    litigation friend was completed on 27 March 2019  suggesting  that  the
    appellant's son OSD could act as a litigation friend the appellant.

6     It is to be noted  that  at  the  outset  of  the  judge's  subsequent
    decision, the judge provided as follows at [1]:

         "Noting the contents of the psychiatric  reports,  I  assessed  the
         Appellant as a vulnerable adult and made  in  anonymity  direction.
         The appellant's son  Mr  (OSD)  was  appointed  as  her  litigation
         friend."

7     The judge considered the evidence before her  as  to  the  appellant's
    ill-health, which included the two reports from Dr Jethwa, a GP  letter
    dated 23 January 2017,  and  a  copy  of  the  appellant's  GP  records
    spanning the period 2010 to 15 January 2019 (appellant's  supplementary
    bundle pages 1 to 51), as well as various UK hospital letters  relating
    to the appellant's health,  and  some  documents  obtained  from  India
    relating to the appellant's health care whilst living there.

8     The judge considered that evidence  and  made  a  number  of  findings
    which included the following:

    (i)    the appellant had been able to engage with Dr  Jethwa  in  March
           2017 [8];

    (ii)   given that the appellant's adult daughter  JSK  had  given  oral
           evidence  that  her  late  father  had  told  her  that  he  had
           previously had to 'administer' the appellant's medication due to
           her depression [10] it  was  then  'very  surprising'  that  JSK
           stated that in the  United  Kingdom  the  family  had  left  the
           appellant to take her own medication [11];

    (iii)  the witnesses written statements spoke of  'reminders'  for  the
           appellant to take her medication, this being in  acute  contrast
           with the suggestion that she had medication administered to  her
           [12];

    (iv)   information provided by JSK said  her  father  'cared  for'  the
           appellant  in  India  was  different  to  the  report  from  the
           appellant herself to Dr Jethwa [13];

    (v)    the appellant's report to Dr Jethwa in February  2017  that  she
           did not suffer from depression  prior  to  her  husband's  death
           conflicted with the oral evidence of  the  appellant's  daughter
           who suggested  that  the  appellant's  depression  was  a  long-
           standing problem [14];

    (vi)   there appeared to be some interaction with  the  appellant  with
           extended relatives in India [15];

    (vii)  there were very  contradictory  reports  about  the  appellant's
           suicidal inclination  but  there  was  little  to  suggest  that
           actions were taken to prevent suicide or access to crisis  teams
           [17];

    (viii) the GP letter of 23 January 2017 contained no detailed  analysis
           of the appellant's medical conditions or how they  affected  her
           ability to self care [19];

    (ix)   the witness statement of OSD suggested that  the  appellant  was
           not eating was in contrast to the  information  in  Dr  Jethwa's
           report that the appellant may be putting on weight due  to  lack
           of exercise and the reports regarding the appellant's BMI in the
           GP notes, which suggested that her BMI was increasing in the  UK
           rather than decreasing, which suggested a healthy appetite,  and
           the appellant was recorded as being actively encouraged to  lose
           some weight and embrace a healthy diet [20];

    (x)     a  suggestion  that  the  appellant   had   refused   to   take
           antidepressant medication because it disagreed with  her  showed
           some insight into her condition [21];

    (xi)   whereas the family had suggested that the appellant  had  memory
           difficulties, there was no memory functioning test;  the  family
           had stated that they could not afford to pay  for  one,  despite
           paying for two psychiatric reports and offering to pay  for  the
           appellant's health care from the NHS [23];

    (xii)  when the appellant returned to the United Kingdom in  2016  (she
           had previously visited the UK) she  was  assessed  as  having  a
           minor osteoarthritis in her left shoulder and there was no long-
           standing depressive illness reported [24];

    (xiii) further visits to the GP on 7 September 2016 and 11 October 2016
           were followed by a visit on 21 January 2017 when  the  GP  notes
           that the family wished the GP to write  a  letter  to  the  Home
           Office, describing the appellant's low  mood  and  anxiety;  the
           appellant was prescribed antidepressants (citalopram); the judge
           noted that it was only when her leave to enter  (as  a  visitor)
           was about to expire that the issue  of  the  appellant's  mental
           health was raised [27];

    (xiv)  there was scant mention of her mental health in  the  GP  notes,
           the main issue being her shoulder; the judge was  not  satisfied
           that the appellant's mental health was a significant issue  from
           the number of occasions she had accessed help from her GP or any
           intervention thereafter [28];

    (xv)   the judge held that the family had  exaggerated  the  assistance
           needed by the appellant, and that the history of  the  help  she
           needed prior to her husband's death was inconsistent [29];

    (xvi)  the appellant's weight did not support a need prompting  to  eat
           [29];

    (xvii) an ophthalmologist's letter dated  16  February  2018  confirmed
           that the appellant had a  mild  retinopathy  following  cataract
           surgery which had been successful, and that she was able to hear
           during   the   consultations   and   interviews   with   medical
           professionals  and  there  was  little  to  indicate  functional
           hearing loss [30];

    (xviii)      "The updated report of Dr Jethwa dated 7  March  2019  did
           not appear to recognise that  the  appellant's  retinopathy  was
           mild, or that she had not  accessed  mental  health  therapy  or
           medication. Dr Jethwa recognised that the family  said  she  had
           poor memory  but  that  there  was  little  record  of  concerns
           regarding her memory.  Control  of  her  diabetes  had  in  fact
           improved. Whilst I agree  that  the  appellant's  condition  had
           changed, it was for the better, and not for the worse" [31];

    (xix)  "Dr Jethwa considered that whilst the appellant  understood  the
           proceedings, she needed help to  conduct  the  proceedings.  She
           formed the opinion that she could not retain  information,  even
           though  there  were  no  medical  concerns  about  her   memory,
           presumably on the basis that during  the  second  interview  she
           could not recall dates. It was not clear to me on what basis  Dr
           Jethwa made that assessment.  Dr  Jethwa  recommended  a  memory
           assessment. Like her previous recommendation, this was not acted
           upon." [32];

    (xx)   the appellant's main  concern  was  a  physical  one,  her  left
           shoulder; she had not mentioned her depression immediately after
           the death of her husband; it was noteworthy that the GP recorded
           the request for a letter to the Home Office  before  the  issues
           about her mental health were raised; she  had  not  consistently
           raised her low mood despite frequent visits to her GP;  she  had
           not taken her antidepressants or sought  alternatives;  she  had
           not accessed therapy as recommended by Dr Jethwa; the assertions
           about her memory are unsubstantiated and  the  family  have  not
           been credible or consistent about her care needs  prior  to  the
           appellant's husband's death or thereafter [35];

    (xxi)  the appellant was a lady of mature  years,  with  some  physical
           concerns, and of low mood since the death of  her  husband;  she
           may feel isolated and alone in India but emotional  support  and
           prompting can take place remotely; there is  little  to  suggest
           that the villagers/neighbours would not provide support, even if
           this had to be paid for [36];

    (xxii) on the subject of reintegration, the judge found that there  had
           been little deterioration in the appellant's health  to  prevent
           reintegration since she left India;  on  her  own  evidence  her
           husband took charge of all  the  management  the  household  the
           appellant took a backseat; thus she chose not  to  integrate  to
           the level that he did; she would not have the  support,  husband
           upon return and this would have to  integrate  more  fully  with
           those around her [37];

    (xxiii)      having spent so much time in India, the judge  was  unable
           to conclude the appellant would not be able to reintegrate there
           as a widow [39];

    (xxiv)  the  appellant  appeared  to  have  an  understanding  of   her
           medication, having chosen not to take her  antidepressants,  but
           agreed to take other medication [41];

    (xxv)  the appellant may find it more difficult  to  access  healthcare
           from her village and this may necessitate a move;  the  lack  of
           medical facilities in her home village is not a reason  for  the
           appellant to be permitted to access NHS healthcare which he  has
           no right to access [41];

    (xxvi) "Regrettably the situation of the Appellant  was  an  inevitable
           consequence of the children leaving India and relocating in  the
           UK and leaving the parents in India. At some point one  or  both
           of the parents would grow older and may develop some physical or
           mental infirmity. They may need care and access  to  healthcare.
           The children have the invidious choice of returning to India  to
           care for their parents, to  pay  for  their  care  in  India  if
           parents cannot afford to do so,  or  rely  on  family  in  India
           unless they  meet  the  stringent  test  under  the  immigration
           rules." [44];

    (xxvii)       the  decision  refusing  the  human  rights   claim   was
           proportionate [46].

9     The appellant's appeal was dismissed.

10     Permission  to  appeal  against  the  judge  decision   was   sought.
    Permission  was  initially  refused,  but   the   appellant's   renewed
    application for permission to appeal argued that the judge had erred in
    law, in summary, as follows:

    (i)    the assessment by Dr Jethwa that the appellant  lacked  capacity
           had been 'ignored/rejected almost entirely' when looking at  the
           appellant's case under the immigration rules and Article 8 ECHR;
           given that the appellant's lack of capacity was said to be  core
           to the issues in the claim, it was submitted  that  the  judge's
           approach to this matter amounted to  a  material  error  of  law
           (grounds, paragraph 9-12];

    (ii)   failing to consider properly or at  all  the  appellant's  claim
           under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the immigration rules regarding
           very significant obstacles to the appellant's reintegration into
           India; the  judge  had  failed  to  take  account  of  objective
           evidence placed before the Tribunal on the position  of  elderly
           women in rural India (examples of which were set out further  in
           the grounds of appeal at paragraph 18(a)-(g)),  the  appellant's
           age, cultural considerations and the history of her  upbringing,
           having had an arranged marriage as a teenager  and  having  only
           attended school two years; the judge  failed  to  make  a  broad
           evaluative judgement recommended in Secretary of State  for  the
           Home Department v Kamara [2016]  EWCA  Civ  813,  including  the
           requirement to consider:

                "whether the individual will be  enough  of  an  insider  in
                terms of understanding how life in the society in that other
                country is carried on and a capacity to participate  in  it,
                so as to have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there,
                to be able to operate on a day-to-day basis in that  society
                and to build up within a reasonable time a variety of  human
                relationships to give substance to the individual's  private
                or family life" (Grounds of appeal, paragraphs s13-19); and

    (iii)  erring in  the  judge's  approach  to  the  credibility  of  the
           witnesses in the appeal:

           (a)   misconstruing the evidence given relating to the admission
                of medication/reminding the appellant taken medication;

           (b)   insofar as the judge found that  the  appellant  could  be
                reminded to take medication by the use of  digital  devices,
                in failing to take into account  that  she  was  illiterate,
                lacked capacity and would not be filling familiar with  such
                devices;

           (c)   in purporting to find an  inconsistency  in  the  evidence
                given by JSK that her father had 'cared for'  the  appellant
                in India, and the appellant's own description of her  health
                in India given to Dr Jethwa,  in  failing  to  have  any  or
                adequate regard to the actual evidence on those issues;

           (d)   in appearing to find that the  appellant  had  interaction
                with extended relatives  in  India,  failing  to  take  into
                account cultural considerations as to  why  the  person  who
                informed the appellant of her husband's death may have  been
                described as 'uncle';

           (e)   insofar as the judge 'held against the appellant' the fact
                that family members had asked the GP for  a  report  on  her
                health, that  did  not  represent  an  adequate  reason  for
                holding any matter against the appellant;

           (f)   in suggesting that OSD's evidence that his mother had  not
                been eating was contrary  to  information  contained  in  Dr
                Jethwa's report regarding the appellant's weight, the  judge
                failed to have any or  sufficient  regard  to  the  evidence
                contained in the GP records over time, which suggested  that
                the appellant was indeed  losing  weight,  not  gaining  it,
                between 2016 and 2018;

           (g)   the judge's finding that 'I was  not  satisfied  that  her
                mental health was a significant issue  from  the  number  of
                occasions  she  had  accessed  help  from  her  GP  or   any
                intervention thereafter' failed to  take  into  account  the
                oral evidence of JSK and the written evidence of OSD that it
                was, in summary, difficult to get the appellant to go to  GP
                appointments and that the appellant had not  been  taken  to
                mental health services or for  a  memory  test  because  the
                appellant does not want to leave the house;

           (h)   the judge had overall, misunderstood the  evidence  before
                her and failed to have regard to relevant evidence.

11    Permission to appeal was granted on 25 June  2019  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge McWilliam in following terms:

         "According  to  the  evidence  of  a  consultant  psychiatrist  the
         appellant struggled  to  provide  answers  and  she  did  not  have
         capacity. Whilst the expert opined that she did not have  capacity,
         he also recommended that the appellant's memory  be  assessed.  The
         expert said that her past history of health problems is  likely  to
         indicate an increased risk  of  memory  problems  due  to  vascular
         problems.

         There was no further assessment made of the appellant. Whilst it is
         arguable that there was no evidence about the cause of the problem,
         it is arguable that the judge did not  adequately  explain  why  he
         chose to attach no weight to the assessment made  by  a  consultant
         psychiatrist that the appellant lacked capacity.

         All grounds are arguable."




    Submissions

12    On behalf of the appellant,  Ms  Solanki  relied  on  the  grounds  of
    appeal and expanded on them, drawing my attention to  various  extracts
    of the medical evidence and country information.

13    Mrs Aboni resisted the appeal, arguing that the  judge  had  correctly
    directed herself in law, taking all relevant evidence into account, and
    made a decision which was open to her on the evidence.




    Discussion

    Ground (i)

14    The appellant's  first  ground  does,  ultimately,  identify  a  'core
    issue' in the appeal (Grounds, paragraph 12).  The appellant's case was
    sometimes put on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  'lacked  capacity'.
    However, considerations of capacity  should  always  be  put  into  the
    proper context; what is it that the appellant was said to lack capacity
    to do? It is to be noted that capacity  as  defined  under  the  Mental
    Capacity Act 2005 ('MCA 2005') must be approached on an  issue-specific
    basis. Section 2(1) of the Act provides that:

         "For the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in  relation
         to a matter if at the material time he is unable to make a decision
         for himself in relation to the matter because of an impairment  of,
         or a  disturbance  in  the  functioning  of,  the  mind  or  brain"
         (emphasis added).

15    Being more specific, of course, it was  asserted  that  the  appellant
    lacked capacity to conduct the proceedings, those proceedings being the
    bringing and prosecution of a human rights appeal before the First tier
    Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber).

16    Under section 3(1)(b) MCA 2005 Act, a person is to  be  deemed  unable
    to make a decision on a particular matter if he  is  unable  to  retain
    information relevant to the decision.

17    In Dr Jethwa's second report (7 March 2019), the  doctor  observed  as
    follows:

         "47      In my opinion Mrs (K)  understands  that  the  proceedings
         related to her immigration case, however  she  does  not  have  the
         capacity to act on her own  behalf.  She  appears  to  struggle  to
         answer basic questions, she is likely to find the proceedings  very
         stressful. She was not able to retain new information explained  to
         her regarding  those  proceedings.  She  will  be  unable  to  make
         representations or follow the required legal procedure  within  her
         case. In my opinion she would require assistance from  a  solicitor
         to act on her behalf."

18    The judge addresses that evidence in her paragraphs 31-32:

         "31.     The updated report of Dr Jethwa dated 7 March 2019 did not
         appear to recognise that the appellant's retinopathy was  mild,  or
         that she had not accessed mental health therapy or  medication.  Dr
         Jethwa recognised that the family said she had poor memory but that
         there was little record of concerns regarding her  memory.  Control
         of her diabetes had in fact  improved.  Whilst  I  agree  that  the
         appellant's condition had changed, it was for the better,  and  not
         for the worse.

         32.      Dr Jethwa considered that whilst the appellant  understood
         the proceedings, she needed help to conduct  the  proceedings.  She
         formed the opinion that she  could  not  retain  information,  even
         though there were no medical concerns about her memory,  presumably
         on the basis that during the second interview she could not  recall
         dates. It was not clear to me on what basis  Dr  Jethwa  made  that
         assessment. Dr Jethwa recommended a  memory  assessment.  Like  her
         previous recommendation, this was not acted upon."

19    Therefore, the judge does within that  passage  appear  to  query  the
    conclusion of Dr Jethwa that the appellant lacked capacity  to  conduct
    the proceedings. The querying of the doctor's opinion  in  that  regard
    would certainly be consistent with the judge's findings elsewhere, as I
    have summarised them above at [8(i), (x), (xiv), and  (xx)],  that  the
    appellant's mental health problems had been exaggerated.

20    There are many challenges to the way that  the  judge  approached  the
    medical evidence. However, a key question is; did  the  judge  actually
    treat the appellant as lacking capacity to conduct the proceedings,  or
    not? The general proposition within the  appellant's  first  ground  is
    that she did not, and erred in law in failing to do so.

21    However such a proposition this must be contrasted with paragraph  [1]
    of  the  decision,  where  the  judge  clearly  appoints  OSD  as   the
    appellant's  litigation  friend.  If  the  judge  had   considered   it
    appropriate to appoint him as litigation friend, this must have been on
    the basis that the  judge  was  satisfied  that  the  appellant  lacked
    capacity to conduct the proceedings.

22    However, in the light of the judge's comments at  [31]-[32],  and  her
    findings as I have  summarised them above at  [8(i),  (x),  (xiv),  and
    (xx)], it is not all clear what 'impairment of, or a disturbance in the
    functioning of, the (appellant's) mind or  brain'  the  judge  accepted
    existed. The majority of the judge's findings within the decision  tend
    to suggest that the judge was not satisfied the appellant had any  real
    impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of her mind or brain.

23    The judge ultimately described the appellant at [36] as being 'a  lady
    of mature years, with some physical concerns and of low mood since  the
    death of her husband'.  If that was, in reality, the judge's assessment
    of the appellant's health, then  it  is  difficult  to  understand,  in
    particular having regard to [31]-[32], why the judge  agreed  that  the
    appellant required a litigation friend, as recorded at [1].

24    There is, therefore, I find, a fundamental dichotomy  running  through
    the whole of the judge's decision, which the judge does not  adequately
    resolve; either the appellant lacked capacity to  conduct  proceedings,
    because of an impairment of or a disturbance in the functioning of  her
    mind or brain (and which must have had some significant effect on  her,
    in order to deprive her of that which would ordinarily be  presumed  to
    exist (see MCA 2005 s.1(2)), or she did not. Elements  of  the  judge's
    decision tended to suggest that the judge accepted that  the  appellant
    had such an impairment or disturbance (para (1)), and others  in  which
    she did not.

25    I am of the view that on the basis of the evidence before  the  judge,
    she would not have been compelled to make findings one way or the other
    on the issue of  whether  the  appellant  had  a  sufficiently  serious
    impairment or disturbance in the functioning of her mind  or  brain  to
    result in her lacking capacity to conduct the proceedings; some of  the
    judge's observations regarding the  quality  of  the  medical  evidence
    relating to the appellant's mental health are perfectly understandable.
    However,  the  judge's  appointment  of   a   litigation   friend   was
    inconsistent with  the  judge's  other  findings  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's mental health.

26    I find that that inconsistency undermines the  whole  of  the  judge's
    decision. It is to be noted that whether or not  the  appellant  lacked
    capacity to conduct proceedings would not necessarily be  determinative
    of her ability to perform tasks of daily living such as learning how to
    go to the shops without the assistance  of  her  late  husband,  buying
    goods at the market, paying for utility bills etc,  in  India,  if  she
    were required to return to live there, but it is  clearly  relevant  to
    the assessment of her ability to engage in those activities.

27    In  the  light  of  my  finding  that  the  judge's  approach  to  the
    appellant's  mental  health  contained  a  fundamental  and  unresolved
    discrepancy, it is not necessary for me to consider  the  remainder  of
    the appellant's grounds of appeal.

28    Although I reserved my decision at the hearing,  both  parties  agreed
    that should the judge's decision contain a material error of  law  such
    that it needed to be set aside, the appropriate outcome  would  be  for
    the matter to be remitted to the First tier, for fresh findings of fact
    to be made. I agree.




    Decision

    The judge's decision involved the making of a material error of law

    I set the judge's decision aside

    I remit the appeal for rehearing by the First tier Tribunal.

29    The appellant shall advise the First tier Tribunal in  writing  if  an
    interpreter is required for the remitted hearing.
