                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was  born  on  1  December
    1982.   On  7  April  2017,  the  appellant  made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain ("ILR") based  upon  ten  years'  continuous
    lawful residence under para 276B of the Immigration Rules  (HC  395  as
    amended).  On 5 October  2017,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the
    appellant's application for leave under para 276B and also under Art  8
    of the ECHR.

 2. The appellant's appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  dismissed  by
    Judge C J Woolley in a decision promulgated on 3 May 2018.

 3. The appellant now appeals to the Upper Tribunal with permission granted
    by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Blundell) on 15 August 2018.

The Immigration History

 4. The appellant had entered the UK on 26  March  2007  with  leave  as  a
    student valid until 30 April 2010.  That leave was  extended  until  27
    September 2011 when the appellant made a further application for  leave
    as a Tier 4 Student.  This  was  refused  on  12  December  2011.   The
    appellant tried to appeal out of time on 9 January 2012 but his  notice
    of appeal was rejected as being out of time on 2 February 2012.  As was
    accepted  before  Judge  Woolley,  the  appellant's  leave,  therefore,
    expired on 4 January 2012 when time for lodging any appeal had expired.



 5. The appellant then made an out of time application for further leave as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student on  9  March  2012.   Leave  to  remain  was
    granted on 21 June 2012 until 28 October 2013.

 6. Prior to his leave expiring, on 28 October 2013 the appellant  made  an
    application for further leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student  which  was
    granted until 31 December 2014.

 7. On 31 December 2014, the appellant applied for further leave as a  Tier
    4 (General) Student and that application was refused on 12  June  2015.
    Following an administrative review on 29 June 2015, that  decision  was
    maintained and the appellant's leave, thereafter,  expired  on  6  July
    2015.

 8. The appellant unsuccessfully sought judicial review of the decision  to
    refuse his application for further leave as a Tier 4 (General)  Student
    (see Saha and Anor v SSHD [2017] UKUT 17 (IAC)).

 9. The present application for ILR based upon 12 years' continuous  lawful
    residence was made on 7 April 2017 and was refused on 5  October  2017.
    It is against that latter decision that the appellant appeals in  these
    proceedings.

The Judge's Decision

10. Before Judge Woolley it was accepted by the appellant's (then)  counsel
    that he could not establish ten years' continuous lawful  residence  in
    the UK for the purposes of para 276B.  The appellant did not have valid
    leave from 4 January 2012 until 21 June 2012, a period of 168 days  and
    the appellant's leave finally expired on 6 July 2015.    Judge  Woolley
    found that the appellant could not establish a  period  of  ten  years'
    lawful residence between 26 March 2007 (when he first entered  the  UK)
    and 6 July 2015 (when his last period of leave expired).   Neither  the
    grounds, nor Mr Symes in  his  submissions,  sought  to  challenge  the
    judge's finding in respect of para 276B.

11. Before Judge Woolley the appellant relied upon para  276ADE  but  Judge
    Woolley found that there were not "very significant obstacles"  to  his
    reintegration into Bangladesh and so he could not  succeed  under  para
    276ADE(1)(vi).  That finding was not challenged in the grounds and  was
    again not challenged by Mr Symes in his submissions.

12. Before Judge Woolley, it was also accepted that the appellant could not
    succeed as a 'partner' or 'parent' under Appendix FM.  The  appellant's
    wife is a Bangladeshi national who is not settled in the UK  and  their
    daughter, then aged 2� years, is neither a British citizen nor  settled
    in the UK and had not been in the UK for at least seven years.

13. The thrust, therefore, of the appellant's claim  before  Judge  Woolley
    was under Art 8 outside the  Rules.   In  that  regard,  the  appellant
    contended that the Secretary of State had  been  wrong  to  refuse  his
    claim under the Rules, inter alia, under para 322(2) on the basis  that
    the appellant had, in making his earlier applications on 9  March  2012
    and  25  October  2013,  submitted  a   fraudulently   obtained   TOEIC
    certificate  from  ETS.   That  conclusion  had   unsuccessfully   been
    challenged in the judicial review proceedings.

14. Nevertheless, before Judge Woolley the appellant maintained that he had
    not used a proxy test taker but had taken  the  English  language  test
    himself and therefore  had  not  fraudulently  obtained  and  used  the
    English language certificate.  Judge Woolley accepted, on the  evidence
    before him, that the Secretary of State had not  established  that  the
    appellant  had  submitted  a  fraudulently  obtained  English  language
    certificate in his earlier application and so had not established  that
    para 322(2) applied.

15. Judge Woolley then went on to consider the appellant's claim under  Art
    8 outside the Rules.  First, he found that it was in the best interests
    of the appellant's child, aged 2�, that  she  should  return  with  her
    family to Bangladesh (see para 42).  He also found  that  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect her to go to Bangladesh with her parents (see para
    51).  Then, at paras 52-54 of his determination  the  judge  considered
    first, potential factors "acting against the appellant" (at paras 52(i)-
    (v)) and then potential factors in "favour of the appellant" (at  paras
    52(vi)-(viii);   then,   he   reached   an   overall   conclusion    on
    proportionality and Article 8 (at para 52(ix) and  53-54).   The  judge
    said this:

         "The wider proportionality assessment

         52.  I have found that the appellant enjoys a  private  and  family
             life in the UK and that his rights to a private life  will  be
             interfered with by the decision to  refuse  his  human  rights
             claim.   The  issue  therefore  remains  as  to  whether  this
             decision is proportionate to the  legitimate  aim  identified.
             The Lord Chief Justice in Hesham  Ali  recommended  a  balance
             sheet approach to the exercise of assessment.

             Potential factors acting against the appellant

             i)   The appellant's immigration history

                  I find that the appellant's immigration status  has  been
                  precarious from the moment he arrived in the  UK,  and  at
                  times has been unlawful.  He arrived as a Tier  4  student
                  in 2007.  This was always going to be a  temporary  status
                  and he could not have anticipated that he  would  ever  be
                  granted permanent status.  There was a gap in  his  lawful
                  leave in 2012.  His further grant of leave  as  a  Tier  4
                  student again was always going to be a  temporary  status.
                  Since his leave expired on 31st December 2014 he has  been
                  in the UK awaiting a decision or appeal.   His  child  was
                  born while his leave was precarious.  I must take this  as
                  a factor weighing against the  appellant.   MA  (Pakistan)
                  makes   it   plain   however   that   considerations    of
                  'precariousness' should not apply to  the  child  and  the
                  actions of the parent cannot be taken against her.

             ii)  The precariousness of family life

                  The appellant has developed his family life in the UK  at
                  all times while his status was precarious.   His  wife  is
                  Bangladeshi and is not a British citizen or settled in the
                  UK.  Little weight must  be  given  to  any  private  life
                  developed in this way.  These considerations also apply to
                  the development of any family life with  a  non-qualifying
                  partner (see Rajendran (s117B - family life)  [2016]  UKUT
                  00138 (IAC)).

             iii) Knowledge of English and financial independence

                  The appellant has now shown that he  has  a  knowledge  of
                  English through the  production  of  an  English  Language
                  certificate and he was comfortable at the appeal  in  that
                  language.  This however is not a factor in his favour  but
                  a neutral factor.  The appellant is not  allowed  to  work
                  and told me that he was supported by  three  friends  from
                  the  village.   He  cannot  be  regarded  as   financially
                  independent.  This is a factor against him.

             iv)  Reasonableness of return

                  I have found that there are no  significant  obstacles  to
                  his integration in Bangladesh.  In respect of his wife and
                  child I have found that it is reasonable to expect them to
                  return to Bangladesh and that it is in  the  child's  best
                  interests to do so.  His wife is  a  Bangladeshi  national
                  who is not settled in  the  UK  and  no  reason  has  been
                  advanced as to why  she  could  not  return  to  her  home
                  country to live with her husband and child.

             v)   Economic burden on the country

                  The appellant is living in the UK  entirely  dependent  on
                  the charity of his friends.  He cannot be regarded as self-
                  sufficient.  He represents a significant  economic  burden
                  on the country just in terms of the provision  of  housing
                  and healthcare.

             Potential Factors in favour of the appellant

             vi)  I give significant weight to the child's  position.   She
                  was born in the UK and has been in the UK for all  of  her
                  life.  Moreover she cannot be blamed for the  failings  of
                  her parents over this (see Zoumbas v  SSHD  [2013]  1  WLR
                  3690).  Applying the tests laid down in EV (Philippines  v
                  SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874 I note she  will  have  grown  up
                  close to her Bangladeshi  parents  and  will  have  learnt
                  Bangladeshi  culture  through   them.    Her   return   to
                  Bangladesh  will  I  find  be  facilitated   through   her
                  connection by heritage with that country and her  exposure
                  to Bangladeshi culture in the UK.  In terms of her  future
                  education I note the Supreme  Court's  decision  in  Patel
                  [2013] UKSC 72 where Lord Carnwath reminded the court that
                  Article 8 was not a general dispensing power.  In  respect
                  of education he commented 'such considerations do  not  by
                  themselves provide grounds  of  appeal  under  Article  8,
                  which is  concerned  with  private  or  family  life,  not
                  education  as  such.   The  opportunity  for  a  promising
                  student to complete his course in  this  country,  however
                  desirable in general terms,  is  not  in  itself  a  right
                  protected under Article 8".  I  do  not  accept  that  the
                  position of  the  child  can  be  distinguished  from  the
                  appellant in Patel, and in any  event  Lord  Carnwath  was
                  setting down a general principle.  I find that  the  child
                  could continue their development and education  adequately
                  in Bangladesh, even though this might not be to  the  same
                  standard as in the UK.

             vii) Contribution to the community

                  I accept that the appellant has made a contribution to his
                  local community.  He is  a  local  leader  of  Bangladeshi
                  organisations and has made  a  wider  contribution  to  UK
                  society through his  cricket  playing  at  a  high  level.
                  Following Lama (video recorded evidence - weight - Article
                  8 ECHR: Nepal) [2017]  UKUT  16  (IAC)  I  accept  that  a
                  positive contribution to society can be given some weight.

             viii)    Private and family life in the UK

                  I have accepted that  the  appellant  has  a  private  and
                  family life in the UK and accept that he would much prefer
                  to remain in the UK rather than returning  to  Bangladesh.
                  Article 8 however gives no one the right  to  choose  once
                  country of residence over another.  I bear  in  mind  that
                  any private and family life has been built  up  while  the
                  appellant's immigration status has been precarious and  he
                  has had no guarantee of that private and  family  life  in
                  the UK continuing.  There could have  been  no  reasonable
                  expectation that the appellant would be allowed  to  stay,
                  even once he had married and had a  child.   I  find  that
                  Sections 117B(4) and  (5)  are  engaged  and  that  little
                  weight  should  be  given  to  the  private  life  he  has
                  developed  while   his   immigration   status   has   been
                  precarious.  Even though this is not a factor that can  be
                  taken against the  child  it  is  still  relevant  in  the
                  overall balancing exercise.

             ix)  Overall conclusion on the proportionality exercise

                  Answering the questions put in Agyarko and  Hesham  Ali  I
                  find that the objective of the measure (namely the refusal
                  of further leave to the  appellant  in  the  interests  of
                  legitimate immigration control) is sufficiently  important
                  to justify the limitation of any private and  family  life
                  rights of the appellant, and that the measure of  refusing
                  his application is rationally connected to  the  objective
                  of  legitimate  immigration  control   in   the   economic
                  interests of the UK.  I find that a lesser  measure  could
                  not have been employed.  I find  that  the  importance  of
                  legitimate immigration control outweighs the rights of the
                  appellant and his family which I  have  summarised  above.
                  Applying the balance sheet approach it is clear  that  the
                  countervailing factors  do  not  outweigh  the  importance
                  attached  to  the  principle  of  legitimate   immigration
                  control.  The appellant  may  face  some  difficulties  on
                  return to Bangladesh after being in the UK  for  so  long,
                  but the fact that this  is  so  does  not  mean  that  his
                  Article  8  rights  are  thereby  being   breached.    The
                  appellant has not produced a very compelling case so as to
                  outweigh the public interest in removal.

         53.  I was referred in the skeleton argument  to  the  comments  of
             Lord Reed in Agyarko at para 51 (see page 4 of skeleton).  The
             words highlighted read 'if, on the other hand, an applicant  -
             even if residing in the UK unlawfully - was otherwise  certain
             to be granted leave to enter, at least if an application  were
             made from outside the  UK,  then  there  might  be  no  public
             interest in his or her removal'.  From the facts I have found,
             however, the appellant would not  be  certain  to  be  granted
             leave to enter.  He has no income of his own  and  no  support
             apart from the charity of his friends.  He has  not  mentioned
             any resources he might have in Bangladesh.  It is hard to  see
             how  he could ever meet any of the financial requirements  for
             leave to enter, in  whatever  capacity  he  applied  in.   The
             Supreme Court in Agyarko also placed an important gloss on the
             Chikwamba principle in cases involving precarious family life,
             as this has always been.  In precarious family life cases  'it
             would be necessary to establish that  there  were  exceptional
             circumstances  to  warrant  such  a  conclusion'  (i.e.   that
             Chikwamba might apply notwithstanding  a  finding  that  there
             were no significant difficulties to  private  life  continuing
             outside the UK).  I find  that  no  exceptional  circumstances
             have been raised in this appeal.   There  has  been  no  undue
             delay in decision making on the part of  the  respondent  (the
             application was made on 7th April 2017 and the  decision  made
             on 5th October 2017) and the appellant has been  in  no  doubt
             since his leave expired in December 2015  that  his  continued
             stay was precarious.

         Overall conclusion on Article 8

         54.  Putting all the factors into the  balance,  I  find  that  the
             interests of the appellant and his family in  the  UK  do  not
             outweigh the interests of immigration control.   I  find  that
             the balance does not come down in favour of  those  rights  as
             against the principle of legitimate  immigration  control.   I
             find that hardship consequent on refusal of  leave  to  remain
             does not go far enough beyond the baseline to make  removal  a
             disproportionate use  of  lawful  immigration  controls.   The
             appellant and his family can reasonably be expected to  return
             to Bangladesh where they could continue their  life.   I  have
             found it reasonable for the child to return with him  and  his
             wife.  Any obstacles or difficulties  in  removal  do  not  go
             beyond matters of choice or inconvenience.  I  find  that  the
             interference with the appellant's  rights  to  a  private  and
             family life is not of such a level as to breach  those  rights
             and that the decision to refuse leave to remain  is  therefore
             proportionate under Article  8  of  the  European  Convention.
             There would be no unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  the
             appellant, his wife and child returning  to  Bangladesh.   GEN
             3.2 does not  therefore  apply  so  as  to  create  a  general
             dispensation from the requirements of Appendix FM".

Discussion

16. Relying upon  the  grounds  of  appeal,  Mr  Symes  made  a  number  of
    submissions supporting the appellant's contention that the judge's  Art
    8 assessment is legally flawed.

17. First, Mr Symes submitted that the judge failed properly to  take  into
    account that the appellant had not, on the judge's findings,  practised
    any  deception  or  used  a  fraudulently  obtained  English   language
    certificate.  Consequently, the appellant had wrongly been  refused  an
    extension of his leave in 2015 on that basis.  Mr Symes submitted  that
    if  the  true  position  had  been  known  in  2015,  the   appellant's
    immigration history would have been different.  In any event, the judge
    gave no credit to the fact that the appellant had  been  on  a  "lawful
    residence route" and it was only the TOEIC issue that derailed him.

18. The difficulty with Mr Symes' submission is, as Mr  Howells  identified
    in his submissions, that the refusal of leave on 12 June 2015  was  not
    based exclusively  on  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  previously
    submitted a fraudulently obtained English language certificate.  It was
    also refused because the appellant did not have a valid Confirmation of
    Acceptance  for  Studies  (CAS)  which  meant  that   the   appellant's
    application for further leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student  was  bound
    to fail in any event.  Mr Symes' submission  that  the  appellant  was,
    after 2015, in difficulties in obtaining a new sponsor because  of  the
    claimed deception is unsupported by any evidence.

19. In truth, the judge correctly approached the substance  and  nature  of
    the appellant's residence in the  UK  over  the  relevant  eleven  year
    period he relied upon under Art 8.  His circumstances were,  and  would
    remain, "precarious".  Even if he had been granted leave in 2015  as  a
    student, he would still not have been able to establish the ten  years'
    continuous lawful residence because of the break of  168  days  in  his
    leave in 2012 and his private life was, at all  times,  established  or
    formed whilst his immigration  status  was  precarious  and  to  which,
    therefore, s.117B(5) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 (the "NIA Act 2002") applied.

20. Secondly, Mr Symes relied on two matters not raised in the grounds.

21. First, he criticised  the  judge  at  para  52(ix)  for  requiring  the
    appellant to produce a "very compelling case" to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in removal.  Mr Symes submitted that that was too high a test,
    reflecting that applicable in deportation cases where an individual has
    been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least four years.

22. It is unfortunate that the judge  imposed  the  epithet  "very"  before
    "compelling" in para 52(ix) (see also para 49(iv)).  However,  overall,
    it is clear  that  the  judge  did  not  impermissibly  carry  out  the
    balancing exercise required under Art 8.2.  First, he set out  the  law
    in some detail at para 49(i)-(iv).  As I  have  already  indicated,  he
    considered the best interests of the appellant's  child  and  concluded
    that it was both reasonable to expect her to go to Bangladesh with  her
    parents and in her best interests to do so.   He  then  considered  the
    competing factors "against" and "in favour" of the appellant  at  paras
    52(i)-(vii).  The judge clearly had in mind the  approach  favoured  by
    the Supreme Court in R (Agyarko) and Anor v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 that  a
    claim outside the Rules under Art 8 would only succeed  if  there  were
    "unjustifiably harsh consequences" such that the public interest  would
    then be outweighed (see [48] and [57]-[60]).  In  cases  where  private
    and family life is "precarious", the Supreme Court stated that: "a very
    strong or compelling claim is required to outweigh the public  interest
    in immigration control" (at [57]).  Judge  Woolley  cited  Agyarko  (at
    paras 43, 49(iv), 52(ix) and 53).  At para 54 the judge made a  finding
    that: "[t]here would be no unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  the
    appellant, his wife and child returning to Bangladesh".   That  finding
    is not challenged on any ground such as irrationality.  It is  entirely
    consistent with the approach in Agyarko.  For these reasons, I  am  not
    persuaded that the  judge  misdirected  himself  in  carrying  out  the
    balancing exercise when concluding that the appellant's  removal  would
    be a proportionate interference with his private and family life.

23. Second, Mr Symes submitted that the judge had been  wrong  to  find  in
    para 52(iii) that  the  appellant  was  not  "financially  independent"
    because he was supported by third parties.  Mr Symes submitted that, in
    the light of the Supreme Court's recent decision  in  Rhuppiah  v  SSHD
    [2018] UKSC 58, for the purposes of s.117B(3) of the NIA Act  2002  the
    appellant was "financially independent" providing he was not  dependent
    upon public funds even if that was as a result of third party  support.



24. Whilst Mr Symes is undoubtedly correct as to the proper  interpretation
    of s.117B(3) of the NIA Act 2002 as a result  of  the  Supreme  Court's
    decision in Rhuppiah, which post-dated the  judge's  decision  in  this
    appeal and overruled the Court of Appeal's interpretation of  s.117B(3)
    which the judge applied,  I  am  wholly  unpersuaded  that  this  error
    materially affected the judge's decision and ultimate finding that  the
    appellant's circumstances did not outweigh the  public  interest.   The
    public interest was, undoubtedly, engaged as the  appellant  could  not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules and had no basis for  remaining  in
    the UK apart from any claim under Art 8 (see s.117B(1) of the  NIA  Act
    2002).  The judge found that the appellant, his wife  and  child  could
    reasonably be expected to return to Bangladesh and that it was  in  the
    child's best interest to be with her parents  if  they  returned.   The
    appellant's private and family life in  the  UK  had  been  established
    whilst he had, at best, limited leave to remain  with  no  prospect  of
    settling in  the  UK.   Given  these  circumstances,  and  the  judge's
    findings,  there  were  no  "compelling"  circumstances  (amounting  to
    unjustifiably harsh consequences) to outweigh the  public  interest  in
    effective  immigration  control.   The  judge's  finding  was  entirely
    rational and, in truth, inevitable.

25. For these reasons, I  reject  the  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  as
    augmented by Mr Symes in his oral submissions.

26. The judge did not materially err in law in dismissing  the  appellant's
    appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

27. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under Art 8 did not involve the making of an error of law.  That
    decision stands.

28. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
