                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Rahmat [K], a citizen  of  Afghanistan  born  1
       January 1973, against the decision of the First-tier tribunal  of  14
       March 2018 dismissing his appeal against the decision  of  the  entry
       clearance officer to refuse his application for  entry  clearance  as
       the adult dependent relative of the Sponsor, his brother Fazal [K].


    2. The Sponsor explained in his witness statement of October  2015  that
       he arrived in the UK and claimed asylum; following an appeal  hearing
       he was granted refugee status  on  15  March  2010.  He  subsequently
       located his younger brother Hasan [K], and successfully sponsored him
       to join him in the UK as his  dependent.  Now  Hasan  was  no  longer
       financially dependent on him  having  entered  full-time  employment,
       though they continued to live together  pending  Hasan's  forthcoming
       marriage.

    3. The Sponsor had visited Pakistan in November  2014  with  a  view  to
       seeking out his remaining brother, the  Appellant,  and  located  him
       fortuitously when he came across him begging on the road in Peshawar.
       The Sponsor learned that  the  Appellant  had  nowhere  to  stay  and
       persuaded a local Afghan man, [JK], who ran a chicken farm to let his
       brother stay with him; he paid for his brother's board  and  lodgings
       there. He had last seen his brother when he  was  living  in  Laghman
       Province,  Afghanistan,  with  the  Sponsor's  grandfather  from  his
       mother's side. Since their reunion they had  maintained  contact  via
       telephone. The Appellant lived there because he and their father  did
       not get on well because the latter would say that the  Appellant  was
       not his real son.  However, the grandfather had developed cancer  and
       had now passed away.

    4. The application was refused because it was not  accepted  that  there
       was adequate evidence that the DNA test had been conducted  with  all
       due propriety given the brothers lived in different countries;  there
       was limited evidence of ongoing contact to prove they were as related
       as claimed, aside from photographs, and money transfer  receipts  for
       2015/2016 did  not  demonstrate  that  the  sums  had  actually  been
       received by the Appellant. It was not accepted that his care needs in
       Pakistan were  unmet  given  the  reference  to  having  had  medical
       treatment at two hospitals there. The  Entry  Clearance  Manager  was
       unimpressed by the ensuing grounds of appeal and upheld that decision
       on review.

    5. The First-tier tribunal heard oral  evidence  from  the  Sponsor.  It
       noted that  there  was  evidence  from  Anglia  DNA  of  August  2015
       detailing the procedures followed  during  the  testing  process  and
       found this was adequate to establish the claimed relationship between
       the Appellant and Sponsor. The evidence regarding the  remittance  of
       sums for the former's support in Afghanistan was coherent and  cogent
       and it was understandable that there was no further evidence  of  the
       receipt of those funds. So the history of financial support was  also
       accepted as established.

    6. That left the question of the Appellant's care needs. The  First-tier
       Tribunal summarised the  evidence  before  it.  Dr  Navid  Sabir,  an
       orthopaedic surgeon in Islamabad, had written in September 2015  that
       the Appellant suffered polio when he was aged three  and  that  since
       then he had had no  power  in  his  lower  limbs;  he  suffered  from
       weakness in his hands. He could not wash or feed himself, and  needed
       to be cared for by another person. Accordingly the Tribunal  accepted
       that the Appellant had shown  that  as  a  result  of  disability  he
       required long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks.

    7. The First-tier Tribunal also referred to the evidence of Uzma  Moeen,
       whose report outlined her experience  with  the  Asian  Legal  Advice
       Service  at  SOAS  providing  opinion  evidence  on  various  matters
       relating to law, religion and politics in Pakistan.

    8. Ms Moeen's report set out her opinion that although  policies,  plans
       and legislation in relation to disability existed in  Pakistan,  they
       had not been implemented. Physical disability was widely perceived to
       have supernatural causes and was widely stigmatised. There  had  been
       little progress in the development of policies since the inception of
       public discussions on the subject in 1985. The disabled  often  faced
       the possibility of being treated as outcasts,  and  that  eventuality
       might well face the Appellant.

    9. All Afghan nationals had to register with  the  Pakistan  authorities
       via  the  National  Database  and  Registration  Authority   (NADRA).
       Identity cards were then issued to permit access to accommodation and
       education and other facilities.  Whilst  medical  hospitals  did  not
       demand such cards for  general  treatment,  they  were  required  for
       specialised treatment,  whether  from  government  or  non-government
       organisations. Absent NADRA registration one could not  access  these
       facilities. In May 2016 the Ministry of the Interior had announced  a
       crackdown  to  safeguard  national  territory,  and   a   major   re-
       verification  exercise  was  afoot  in  order  to  ensure  that   the
       identities of all those entitled to  reside  on  the  territory  were
       confirmed. There was particular concern  as  to  the  issue  of  fake
       identity cards to Afghan national. Accordingly it could be reasonably
       foreseen that attempts to access medical treatment might well lead to
       one's detection as an illegal resident.

   10. There was no real social awareness in the community of the  needs  of
       the disabled without family to support them, and there was nothing by
       way of community-based residential facilities. It  was  difficult  to
       hire personal carers. Full-time  care  would  cost  60-70,000  Rupees
       monthly. There were no national standardised criteria for  caregivers
       who were  mostly  needy  people  themselves  struggling  financially,
       leading to a lack of trust and accountability,  bringing  with  it  a
       likelihood of ill treatment and insecurity. There was no governmental
       support available except for  the  poor.  There  was  no  legislative
       protection and the physically disabled were very vulnerable to crime;
       there were no real measures in place to prevent abuse.

   11. The First-tier Tribunal summarises Ms Moeen's report  as  essentially
       giving her opinion that  the  Appellant  as  an  Afghan  residing  in
       Pakistan would be unable to access any form  of  healthcare  adequate
       for his needs. She had not met the Appellant, but  had  reviewed  his
       file. She  considered  that  healthcare  in  Pakistan  was  generally
       inadequate for the disabled.

   12. The Judge found that Ms Moeen had not provided any  analysis  of  the
       Appellant's actual medical and  personal  care  needs.  She  did  not
       denigrate the expert's clearly genuine beliefs as to  the  inadequacy
       of healthcare for the disabled in Pakistan, but found that these  did
       not assist in determining whether the actual care  that  he  received
       was adequate. The evidence did not establish those  care  needs.  The
       most pertinent evidence was a letter from the hospital stating he was
       immobile and could not wash or feed himself, had  used  a  wheelchair
       all his adult life which he could self-propel with some  differently,
       and had no acute health issues. The Afghan farmer who had  taken  him
       in apparently provided him with food, took him to the washroom,  took
       him out and about when needed, and bought  any  items  the  Appellant
       requested, and otherwise helped him, for example taking  him  to  the
       clinic for DNA testing.

   13. In the light of this  evidence,  it  was  not  established  that  the
       Appellant had any significant care  needs  that  were  not  presently
       being met. The fact his health had apparently not  deteriorated  over
       the two years since the application was refused  indicated  that  his
       needs were being met. Accordingly he did  not  satisfy  paragraph  E-
       ECDR.2.5 of the adult dependent relative route under Appendix FM.

   14. His claim under the Rules having failed, his case outside  the  Rules
       required assessment. It was unclear  when  the  brothers  were  first
       separated but given the  Sponsor's  evidence  was  that  he  had  not
       originally recognised his brother and that he  had  been  in  the  UK
       since 2010, their family life was not significant, consisting only of
       very occasional visits by the Sponsor to  Pakistan.  Accordingly  the
       immigration decision did not interfere with the Appellant's Article 8
       rights. There were no exceptional circumstances present in the  case,
       given the lack of pressing medical needs and it did not  appear  that
       there were any plans to expel him or his carer to Afghanistan.

   15. Grounds of appeal of 26 March  2018  contended  that  the  First-tier
       tribunal erred in law by


        a) Failing to appreciate that there were exceptional  circumstances
           rendering the Appellant's exclusion from  the  UK  unjustifiably
           harsh: particularly the severity of his disability, the fact the
           brothers had been displaced from  Afghanistan,  the  Appellant's
           lack of immigration status in Pakistan, and  the  discrimination
           and social exclusion suffered by the disabled there;


        b) Failing to assess the existence of exceptional circumstances  by
           reference to the test as to whether the Appellant's life  abroad
           was unjustifiably harsh having regard to  the  strength  of  the
           family life, as enjoined by Britcits, and having regard  to  the
           Respondent's policy that the public interest was highly relevant
           to whether the relevant threshold was crossed which  necessarily
           required  particular  attention  given  the  Sponsor  had  given
           uncontradicted evidence that the Appellant's UK care needs could
           be met without recourse to public funds;


        c) Failing to take account, when assessing family life, of the fact
           that their separation was compelled by necessity  and  that  the
           Sponsor had  shown  a  long-term  financial  commitment  to  the
           Appellant which had included finding temporary care arrangements
           for him abroad, the relative frequency of his visits to Pakistan
           given his work  commitments,  and  his  significant  efforts  to
           achieve their residence together;


        d) Failing to take account of the Appellant's precarious  residence
           in Pakistan.


   16. Permission to appeal was granted on 15 June 2018 on  the  basis  that
       all the grounds were arguable.


   17. Before me Mr Bandegani for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant
       had a viable claim  outside  the  Rules.  The  First-tier  Tribunal's
       treatment of that claim  was  legally  unsustainable.  There  was  no
       structured assessment applying the various stages of the  appropriate
       analysis in an Article 8 case, and no attempt had been made to strike
       a "fair balance" as required by the Strasbourg authorities. This  had
       led  to  material  considerations  being  overlooked  such   as   the
       precarious nature of the Appellant's residence in  Pakistan  and  the
       circumstances leading to the separation of the brothers: this  was  a
       forced  migration   case.    Furthermore   there   was   no   express
       consideration of the relevant public policy requirement identified in
       section 117B(3) which included the relevance of the credible evidence
       from the Sponsor that arrangements were  in  place  such  that  there
       would be no recourse to public funds.

   18. Mr Kandola replied that the decision was legally sustainable and  the
       First-tier Tribunal had come to findings that were properly  open  to
       it. The question of  exceptional  circumstances  had  been  addressed
       having  regard  to  all  relevant  evidence.  Once  the  appeal   was
       considered outside the  Immigration  Rules  then  there  was  a  very
       stringent test to be applied, and the Appellant had  simply  not  met
       it.

Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

   19. As already indicated, it was not suggested that this was a claim that
       could succeed under the Immigration Rules. Nevertheless  those  Rules
       remain relevant, as a measure  of  the  distance  between  the  human
       rights claim made and the general public policy position struck  with
       respect to this broad class of case.  At  Appendix  FM  paragraph  E-
       ECDR.1.1 onwards, it is clear that an applicant must "as a result  of
       age, illness or disability require long-term personal care to perform
       everyday tasks"; it must be shown that care is  not  available  "even
       with the practical and financial help of the sponsor  because  it  is
       not available and  there  is  no  person  in  that  country  who  can
       reasonably provide it; or it is not affordable." And  the  "specified
       evidence" provisions supporting those requirements require  a  report
       on the available healthcare abroad from a  central  or  local  health
       authority or other health professional.


   20. Those  considerations  must  of  course  be  assessed  realistically,
       recognising that the Rule must be construed  sensibly  so  as  to  be
       capable of satisfaction, see Sir  Terence  Etherton  MR  in  Britcits
       [2017] EWCA Civ 368 �59: "Those considerations include issues  as  to
       the accessibility and geographical location of the provision of  care
       and the standard of care. They are capable of embracing emotional and
       psychological requirements verified by expert medical evidence.  What
       is reasonable is, of course, to be objectively assessed."


   21. The first question when assessing a claim outside the  Rules  is  the
       establishment of family life ties. Here the First-tier Tribunal found
       that Article 8 rights were simply not  engaged:  i.e.  there  was  no
       family life with which there would be a material interference between
       Appellant and Sponsor.

   22. The decision of the Strasbourg Court in Advic v UK (1995) 20 EHRR  CD
       125 is sometimes cited for the proposition that the normal  emotional
       ties between a parent and an adult son or daughter will not,  without
       more, suffice to constitute family life: Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31.
       Buxton LJ emphasised in MT (Zimbabwe) [2007] EWCA  Civ  455  at  [11]
       that Advic, "whilst stressing the need for an element  of  dependency
       over and above the normal between that of a parent or  parent  figure
       and adult  child,  also  stresses  that  everything  depends  on  the
       circumstances of each case". The Upper Tribunal  President  wrote  in
       Lama [2017] UKUT 16 (IAC) �32 that "at its heart, family life denotes
       real or committed personal  support  between  or  among  the  persons
       concerned."

   23. Ongoing contact by telephone with a disabled brother  from  whom  one
       was separated due to the consequences of migration driven by the need
       for international protection (here confirmed via the grant of refugee
       status), combined with the ongoing provision  of  financial  support,
       clearly creates a potential case for the recognition of family  life,
       applying the test of whether there is  "real  or  committed  personal
       support". However it is not possible to  discern  from  the  decision
       below whether the Judge was alive to the relevance of this test or to
       the factors potentially enlivening it. This  is  clearly  a  material
       error of law. It may well have contributed to the extreme brevity  of
       the subsequent disposition of the appeal.

   24. Section 117B of the NIAA 2002 provides:

         "PART 5A


         Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations ...


         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases


         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
         the public interest.


         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-


             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and


             (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-


             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and


             (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (4)      Little weight should be given to-


             (a) a private life, or


             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.


      5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established  by  a
         person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration   status   is
         precarious."

   25. The Upper Tribunal stated in Forman [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC) that:

           "In cases where the provisions of sections 117B-117C of the 2002
           Act arise, the decision of the Tribunal  must  demonstrate  that
           they have been given full effect."

   26. In Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA  Civ  803  �45,  Sales  LJ  noted  that  "the
       starting point for consideration of the proper construction  of  Part
       5A of the 2002 Act is that sections 117A-117D,  taken  together,  are
       intended to provide for a structured approach to the  application  of
       Article 8 which produces  in  all  cases  a  final  result  which  is
       compatible with, and  not  in  violation  of,  Article  8";  and  �53
       "Although a court or tribunal should have regard to the consideration
       that little weight should be given to  private  life  established  in
       [the specified] circumstances, it is possible without violence to the
       language to say that  such  generalised  normative  guidance  may  be
       overridden in an exceptional case by particularly strong features  of
       the private life in question  ..."  That  thinking  was  subsequently
       endorsed by the Supreme Court in Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58 �36, �42-44,
       and particularly �49), accepting  that  cases  which  are  compelling
       outside the Rules and must be approached via the "need for a  degree,
       no doubt limited, of flexibility in the application of Part 5A of the
       2002 Act" Rhuppiah �42.

   27. The essential requirement that Tribunal decision making takes account
       of  the  public  interest  factors  identified  by  section  117B  is
       therefore beyond doubt. Section 117B was not addressed by the  First-
       tier Tribunal in terms. So the question then arose as to whether this
       failing was material to  the  decision  making.  It  is  possible  to
       imagine a scenario where the  considerations  identified  in  section
       117B are addressed, expressly or by inevitable inference, without the
       statutory provision itself being set out. However, this was not  such
       a case. There was clear evidence before the Tribunal below  that  the
       Appellant would not be a  burden  on  public  funds  because  of  the
       measures put in place by the Sponsor, who had  already  overseen  one
       sibling's arrival in the UK without any such burden arising. Yet this
       was not addressed.


   28. There was a  further  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
       approach in relation to the question of  the  precariousness  of  the
       Appellant's residence in Pakistan. The Home  Office  Guidance  Family
       Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family  Life  (as  a  Partner  or
       Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year Routes (22  February  2018)  states
       (very similar material  appears  in  the  5-year  Route  Guidance  of
       October 2017):

           "Ability to lawfully enter and stay in another country


           The decision maker should consider the ability of the members of
           the family unit (both the  applicant  and  others)  to  lawfully
           enter and stay in another country. The onus is on the  applicant
           to show that it is not feasible for them  and  their  family  to
           enter and stay in another country  for  this  to  amount  to  an
           insurmountable obstacle. A mere wish, desire  or  preference  to
           live in the UK is not sufficient.


           An example of where it might not be feasible for the  family  to
           live together elsewhere might be where the  sponsor  has  gained
           their settled status in the UK through a refugee route, and  the
           applicant is of the  same  nationality.  In  the  absence  of  a
           realistic  third  country  alternative,  the  settled   person's
           inability to resume life in the country of origin is  likely  to
           constitute an obstacle to family life continuing  overseas.  The
           decision maker should consider relevant country information (but
           may not  seek  to  go  behind  any  decision  to  grant  refugee
           status)."

   29. The 5-year Route Guidance  also  notes  at  paragraph  13(5)(d)  that
       "Where relevant, the circumstances giving rise to the applicant being
       separated from" from the Sponsor are relevant. This Guidance  is  set
       out in the context of the identification of the kinds of "Exceptional
       circumstances" and "unjustifiably  harsh  consequences"  which  would
       justify departure from the normal consequences of consideration under
       the mainstream Immigration Rules. One appreciates that  the  Guidance
       was articulated outside of the context of Adult Dependent  Relatives,
       but nevertheless it addresses very similar factual  terrain,  ie  the
       situation in which government policy accepts that  conditions  abroad
       are insecure to the extent  that  they  are  unjustifiably  harsh  or
       present insurmountable obstacles  to  an  existence  compatible  with
       appropriate respect for family and private life. It is  important  to
       have regard to such policy material in order to promote  the  general
       objective of consistency in decision making.


   30. The  Home  Office  Guidance  is  consistent  with  a  principle  long
       identified in the case law,  as  identified  by  the  then  President
       Ouseley J in the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in  H  (Somalia)  [2004]
       UKIAT 00027: "It cannot be right to approach the disruption to family
       life which is caused by someone  having  to  flee  persecution  as  a
       refugee as if it were of the same nature as someone  who  voluntarily
       leaves, or leaves in the normal course of the changes to family  life
       which naturally occur as children grow up." In  another  context,  in
       Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320 Lindblom LJ concluded  that  "Throughout  his
       findings and conclusions with  regard  to  article  8(1),  the  Upper
       Tribunal judge concentrated on the appellant's parents'  decision  to
       leave Nepal and settle in  the  United  Kingdom,  without,  I  think,
       focusing on the practical and financial realities  entailed  in  that
       decision. This was, in my opinion, a mistaken approach."


   31. H (Somalia) makes clear that the  circumstances  of  a  family  whose
       separation is driven by forced migration rather than personal  choice
       should receive special attention. The Secretary of  State's  Guidance
       stresses the difference between a case where there is the possibility
       of lawful residence for the family unit abroad. Rai shows  that  some
       family entry clearance applications need to be  analysed  with  close
       attention  being  afforded  the  precise  reasons  for  the  relevant
       parties' separation from one another. These  principles  were  highly
       pertinent to the instant appeal but  received  no  attention  in  the
       conclusions of the Tribunal below.

   32. Furthermore, although the  First-tier  Tribunal  assessed  the  human
       rights claim under the Immigration Rules by reference  to  the  adult
       dependent relative route, it did not expressly assess  whether  there
       was a compelling claim outside the Rules having regard to those Rules
       as a benchmark by which to measure the viability of the  Respondent's
       human rights claim. Indeed it referred only the perceived requirement
       for "exceptional circumstances".

   33. Accordingly I found that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  was
       flawed by material errors of law. As the  resolution  of  the  appeal
       requires limited further fact-finding, it wass appropriate to  retain
       the matter in the Upper Tribunal for a final continuation hearing.

   34. As I noted in the error of law decision, it would be  necessary  when
       re-determining the appeal to bear in mind that health problems may be
       highly relevant to the degree of dependency a migrant has upon  their
       family here. In GS India [2015] EWCA Civ 40 Laws LJ  wrote  �86:  "If
       the Article 3 claim fails ... Article 8 cannot prosper  without  some
       separate or additional factual element which brings the  case  within
       the Article 8 paradigm - the capacity to form and enjoy relationships
       - or a state of affairs having some affinity with the paradigm." Also
       relevant would be the inability of both the Appellant and his present
       carer to lawfully reside in Pakistan.

Evidence and Submissions at the Continuation Hearing

   35. Limited further evidence was filed  by  way  of  an  updated  witness
       statement of November 2018 which set out that  the  Sponsor  had  now
       obtained alternative accommodation for the Appellant, from 5  October
       2018, with a friend,  [AK],  who  the  Sponsor  knew  through  mutual
       friends. [AK] owned a woodcutting business in Pakistan.  The  Sponsor
       continued to visit his brother every 7 or 8  months,  last  doing  so
       from mid-September to early November 2018; he provided [AK] with cash
       whilst in Pakistan, and also remitted funds back from the UK.


   36. In oral evidence the Sponsor stated that the Appellant had  left  his
       former accommodation because it was no longer available to  him.  The
       farmer with whom he was staying had increasingly felt that  he  could
       not guarantee his own safety, as he could be removed from Pakistan at
       any time, and so had returned to Afghanistan. [AK] was also an Afghan
       national. Nobody else lived in the family home.  The  Sponsor's  last
       trip to Pakistan was from September 2018 to  14  November  2018.  His
       brother was not in a very good situation, he was having problems with
       his memory, was often sick, and lived in poor conditions. An  ongoing
       concern was that his brother had converted from Islam to Christianity
       and would be killed if anyone found out. [AK] did not know of this.

   37. Cross examined, the Sponsor stated that he had  visited  Pakistan  in
       November 2014 to continue the search for his brother. Their  maternal
       grandfather had died some time ago, he estimated that he had  learned
       that he had died  around  three  months  before  leaving  Afghanistan
       himself. The arrangements for [AK]  to  take  things  over  from  the
       farmer had been made via a friend  of  the  Sponsor,  [BK],  who  was
       [AK]'s business partner. He had mentioned his family problems to this
       gentleman who had passed the information onto [AK]; the Sponsor  then
       arranged to meet the latter, who agreed to look  after  his  brother.
       The Sponsor had no real associates in Pakistan beyond [AK]. He talked
       to his brother often, asking him how he was  and  whether  he  needed
       help, for example because he had memory problems as well as  physical
       troubles now.

   38. Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted for the Secretary of State that family
       life was simply not established on the facts here; there had  been  a
       lengthy separation of the brothers, who were  adults  who  no  longer
       shared any meaningful family life. The Immigration Rules could not be
       met and there was no medical evidence beyond that  attesting  to  the
       Appellant's disability as a legacy of polio. Presumably he  had  been
       able to access some  element  of  healthcare  without  repercussions,
       given there was no overt evidence of having suffered problems so far.
       The revelation re Christianity  was  a  new  development  and  lacked
       substance. The public interest in maintaining immigration control was
       not outweighed here, and the Appellant's mobility impairment did  not
       justify the grant of entry clearance.

   39. Ms Elliott-Kelly submitted that family life was  clearly  established
       here,  there  was  an  established  blood  relationship  and  regular
       financial remittances upon which the Appellant  wholly  depended.  He
       had no family unit of his own in Pakistan and no prospect of  finding
       any other family with whom to reside in Afghanistan, given his  other
       brother had also migrated to the UK; the grandfather with  whom  they
       had previously lived in Afghanistan was now deceased. His  disability
       made  him  particularly  dependent  in  circumstances  where  he  was
       previously street homeless; he continued to have a somewhat itinerant
       lifestyle. He had clear long-term care needs. The  direction  of  the
       public interest could be seen by the absence of an  English  language
       requirement for the disabled under the Adult Dependent Relative route
       in the Rules, and whether or not every aspect of the  Rules  was  met
       the policy objectives therein were satisfied,  bearing  in  mind  the
       exception  within  the  Rules  at  GEN3.3  which  provided  for   the
       relaxation of some of the strictures of Appendix FM-SE. The Sponsor's
       original witness statement had  referenced  his  brother's  Christian
       beliefs; he could be killed if  the  information  reached  the  wrong
       people.

Findings and reasons - Continuation hearing

   40. It seems to me that  family  life  is  clearly  established  in  this
       particular case. There can be no serious doubt that the Appellant  is
       dependent on the Sponsor, who has taken it upon  himself  to  provide
       him with the financial remittances that are essential to  secure  his
       welfare  in  Pakistan;  he  has  additionally   overseen   his   care
       arrangements and realistically one must recognise  that  the  Sponsor
       must represent the Appellant's sole hope of living a  dignified  life
       in the company of close family members rather than being consigned to
       relying on the temporary support of strangers. They previously  lived
       together as a cohesive family unit, and were separated  only  by  the
       consequences of forced migration (in the Sponsor's case,  leading  to
       the recognition of refugee status). There have been visits since they
       were reunited following the Sponsor's industry in tracking  down  his
       brother, so rekindling their family life. I have no doubt that  there
       is here additional emotional and physical  dependency  exceeding  the
       norm such that the Appellant is dependent on the Sponsor in the sense
       described in the authorities ranging from Advic to Lama.


   41. Equally, there can be little doubt here that the immigration decision
       represents a significant interference with family  life.  Of  course,
       the Strasbourg Court has held that the Convention includes no  right,
       as such, to establish one's family life in a particular country (see,
       inter alia, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United  Kingdom,
       28 May 1985, � 68, Series A no. 94; G�l v. Switzerland,  19  February
       1996, � 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I; and Boultif v.
       Switzerland, no. 54273/00, � 39, ECHR 2001-IX).

   42. Given that there is a genuine  relationship  between  Appellants  and
       Sponsor amounting to family life, it seems to me that maintaining the
       immigration decision does amount to an interference with that  family
       life: that much can  be  seen  by  Quila  in  the  Supreme  Court  as
       conveniently summarised by Aikens LJ in MM (CA)  �116:  "Lord  Wilson
       concluded that the Supreme  Court  should  "decline  to  follow"  the
       rationale of Abdulaziz that Article 8 was not  "engaged"  by  the  IR
       under discussion. He justified not following Abdulaziz on the  ground
       that it was an "old decision",  that  the  distinction  drawn  in  it
       between "positive" and "negative" obligations of the state had  since
       been recognised as an "elusive distinction" and that subsequent ECtHR
       cases had accepted that the concept of interference with family  life
       was broader than it was  believed  to  be  in  1985.  Therefore,  the
       refusal of the Secretary of State to permit the  non-EEA  spouses  to
       reside in the UK with their UK spouses must be an  interference  with
       the parties' Article 8(1) rights.  Accordingly,  "the  only  sensible
       enquiry can be  into  whether  the  refusals  were  justified"  under
       Article 8(2)."


   43. That leaves the question of proportionality. Where a family  unit  is
       essentially reuniting after a period apart, their situation  must  be
       analysed with some care. See Richards LJ in SS (Congo) &  Ors  [2015]
       EWCA Civ 387:

           "35.  ... the position in relation to the LTE Rules is different
           from that in relation to the LTR Rules in two distinct ways.


           36.   First, cases involving someone outside the United  Kingdom
           who applies to come here to take up or resume  family  life  may
           involve family  life  originally  established  in  ordinary  and
           legitimate circumstances at some time in the past,  rather  than
           in the knowledge  of  its  precariousness  in  terms  of  United
           Kingdom immigration  controls  (as  in  the  type  of  situation
           discussed in Nagre). Thus the ECtHR jurisprudence addressing the
           latter type of case, which was the foundation for  the  approach
           in Nagre, will not always be readily applicable as an analogy. A
           person who is a refugee in the United Kingdom  may  have  had  a
           family life overseas which they had to abandon when they fled. A
           British citizen may have lived abroad for years without  thought
           of return,  and  established  a  family  life  there,  but  then
           circumstances change and they come back to  the  United  Kingdom
           and wish to bring their spouse with them."

   44. Doubtless there  are  some  factors  in  favour  of  maintaining  the
       immigration decision. The Appellant  will  not  foreseeably  able  to
       support himself, and so there is some  risk  that  he  will  one  day
       represent a burden on public funds. He will be  joining  an  English-
       speaking family unit of adult brothers, but there is no evidence that
       he speaks the language himself. He does not meet every aspect of  the
       Immigration Rules addressing Adult Dependent Relatives.

   45.  However,  these  factors  are  to  my  mind  outweighed   by   other
       considerations,  including  the  statutory  criteria  identified   in
       section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:


        a) The Appellant is a sibling stranded, abroad and alone, following
           the forced migration of family members for reasons over which he
           had no control;


        b) He is especially vulnerable because he  is  disabled;  the  Home
           Office Guidance (though from another route  within  Appendix  FM
           nevertheless of clear  value  by  analogy)  recognises  that  "a
           physical or  mental  disability  could  be  such  that  in  some
           circumstances it  could  lead  to  very  serious  hardship,  for
           example  due  to  lack  of  health  care  that  amounted  to  an
           insurmountable obstacle";


        c) It is clear that the Appellant faces some risk of  returning  to
           street homelessness given that his circumstances are not secure:
           the  farmer  with  whom  he  previously  resided  felt   himself
           compelled  to  depart  Afghanistan  because  of  the   lack   of
           residential security there - and as the European Court  said  in
           Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1,  para  65,  "The  very
           essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human
           freedom";


        d) The Appellant meets significant aspects of the nearest  relevant
           Immigration Rule, in that the evidence establishes  that  "as  a
           result of age, illness or  disability  [he]  requires  long-term
           personal care to perform  everyday  tasks"  (as  the  First-tier
           Tribunal found, a finding that I endorse), and although  he  can
           temporarily access sufficient care, the ongoing nature  of  that
           care,  provided  by  compatriots  without  durable   immigration
           status, is precarious in the extreme;


        e) Not only the Appellant's home but his very presence in  Pakistan
           is precarious: a  person  subject  to  immigration  control  and
           without legal immigration status will always be at some risk  of
           detection and expulsion, and the Home Office policy cited  above
           understandably expressly recognises this factor - and this  risk
           applies both to  the  Appellant  and  to  his  temporary  Afghan
           carers; indeed another piece  of  Home  Office  guidance  Family
           reunion: for refugees and  those  with  humanitarian  protection
           (Version 2.0; 29 July 2016) is of some analogical value,  as  it
           recognised that unjustifiably harsh consequences  might  include
           circumstances where  one  family  member  is  left  alone  in  a
           conflict zone or dangerous situation, and  where  there  are  no
           other relatives to turn to there, such that he would face a lack
           of durable support and be at risk of becoming destitute;


        f) In reality it seems there should be no significant  recourse  to
           public  funds,  because  of  the  financial  position   of   the
           Appellant's siblings in the UK;


        g) Any lack of English language facility needs to be viewed in  the
           context that the Adult Dependent Relative route does not require
           any such proficiency, doubtless recognising the fact  that  such
           individuals will live primarily with their families  as  primary
           carers;


        h) It is true to say that the Sponsor's original witness  statement
           had referenced the family's (including his brother's)  Christian
           beliefs: "Where my brother lies now no one know about  us  being
           from a Christian family". This could clearly have  repercussions
           for the Appellant if news reached  those  unsympathetic  to  the
           Christian cause in Pakistan.


   46. It seems to  me  that  overall  the  Appellant  plainly  has  a  very
       compelling claim that justifies a finding that the refusal  of  entry
       clearance represents a disproportionate interference with his private
       and family life. I accordingly allow his appeal.

Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained  material  errors  of
    law and is set aside.


    The appeal is allowed.
