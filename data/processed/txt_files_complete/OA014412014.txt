Representation:
For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr David Mills (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This was an appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Malik promulgated on 18th November 2014, in  what  was  a  "paper
    case" before the judge.  In the determination, the judge dismissed  the
    appeal of Mrs Sadia Mehmood, who  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of Pakistan who was born on 27th July
    1990.  She appealed against the Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  her
    application for  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse.   The  basis  of  the
    Respondent's refusal was that the application  made  on  17th  December
    2013 under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules did not comply with the requirements therein set out.   The  date
    of the decision of the Respondent's refusal  letter  is  8th  September
    2014.

The Judge's Findings

 3.  The  judge  accepted  that  the  appeal  bundle  before  him  included
    photographs of the Appellant and the Sponsor's wedding and  a  copy  of
    the translated marriage certificate in Pakistan of the  Appellant  with
    her British citizen husband.  There  were  also  a  number  of  records
    indicating "internet chat" (see paragraph 9).  There was also a copy of
    an e-ticket in the name of the Sponsor indicating that he had travelled
    to Pakistan in February 2014 returning in  March  2014  (see  paragraph
    10).  The judge was satisfied  that  the  Appellant  met  the  required
    standard in that they had met, had  married,  and  were  in  a  genuine
    marriage, and there was the intention to live permanently  together  in
    the UK as man and wife (see paragraph 18).  However, the judge was  not
    satisfied  that  the  Appellant  met  the  requirements  of  the  Rules
    regarding the  income  threshold  requirements  because  the  specified
    documents, required under Appendix FM-SE, had not  been  satisfied  for
    the required periods under consideration.  The judge gave  his  reasons
    for so holding at paragraphs 14, 16, and 17 of the determination.

Grounds of Application

 4. The grounds of application contend that the judge  did  not  take  into
    account all the documentation that was  submitted.   For  example,  the
    judge states at paragraph 15 of the decision that there is no  evidence
    of his statement of account, yet this is at page 358 of the Appellant's
    bundle.  Accordingly, he  had  overlooked  material  evidence  in  this
    matter before him.

 5. On 15th January 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

 6. On 28th January 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect that
    the Appellant did  not  provide  with  the  application  the  specified
    evidence for the required period, and that whilst some of the  evidence
    was provided later, it was not at the time of the application,  and  at
    paragraph 17 the judge had so stated.  There was no material  error  of
    law.

The Hearing

 7. At the hearing before me on 15th January 2016, the  Appellant  was  not
    represented.  Nor was there any explanation for the non-representation.
     More significantly still, the Sponsor was not in  attendance  and  nor
    was there any explanation for the Sponsor's not being at the hearing to
    support his wife's application.

 8. Mr David Mills, appearing as Senior  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,
    submitted that the judge had dismissed the appeal because the  evidence
    to satisfy FM-SE was not before him in the manner required.  This was a
    "paper case".  Mr Mills submitted that he would have to concede that in
    a "paper case" it is often the case that a  party  to  the  proceedings
    simply sends their bundle of documentation to the  Tribunal,  and  does
    not copy in the Home Office, so that  in  this  case  if  the  evidence
    referred to had been sent to the Tribunal, it had  certainly  not  been
    sent to the Home Office Presenting Officers' Unit.

 9. The judge had said (at paragraph 17) that  there  was  evidence  before
    him:

         "To indicate the Sponsor is  self-employed  and  also  employed  as
         claimed; whilst accepting his business was not 'mature' at the time
         of his application, on the evidence before me, it  appears  he  did
         not have all the required documentation at the time of  application
         for the relevant period."

    It is for the Appellant to show that this evidence  was  indeed  before
    the judge.  This was not a points-based application.  This  means  that
    it remains open to the Appellant to submit evidence  right  up  to  the
    date of this hearing which  goes  to  the  relevant  matter  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  He asked me to dismiss the appeal.

Error of Law

10. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.  First, it is plain that the  judge  overlooked  some  of  the
    evidence, and this is clear from  the  way  that  permission  has  been
    granted with express reference to the fact that at paragraph 15 of  the
    determination it is said that there is no evidence of the statement  of
    account and yet at page 358 of the Appellant's bundle this is set out.

11. Second, the judge has erred in law in stating that, "whilst some of the
    required documentation is available now, it was not  available  at  the
    time of the application.  As such  the  Appellant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules ..."  (see  paragraph  17).   This  does  not
    follow at all because it is not a points-based application  and  it  is
    open to  the  judge  to  consider  evidence  that  is  germane  to  the
    application even if it had not  been  submitted  at  the  time  of  the
    application.  The failure to consider this documentation simply on  the
    basis that it was not included at the time of  the  application  is  an
    error of law.

Remaking the Decision

12. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today from Mr Mills.  I am  allowing  this  appeal  for  the  following
    reasons.  The judge found at paragraph 14 of the determination that the
    Appellant had not submitted a personal  bank  statement  for  the  same
    twelve month period as the tax return showing the Sponsor's income from
    his self-employment, paid into his account, and  because  of  this  the
    Appellant had not met the requirements  of  the  Rules.   However,  the
    Sponsor is self-employed.  He is  also  employed.   His  personal  bank
    statement from 1st March 2013 to 2nd September 2013 confirms the salary
    coming into his account.  This shows the income that he receives coming
    into his account for the six month period because he has been  employed
    with the same employer for the last six  months,  and  this  meets  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

13. As far as the business bank  statement  is  concerned  the  Appellant's
    Sponsor submitted a bank statement which covered the six  month  period
    prior to the date of the application.  The Respondent's own bundle  has
    included at the end of it a statement  from  the  Heartlands  Financial
    Services Ltd, dated 31st July 2013  and  this  is  a  letter  from  the
    Sponsor's accountant.  It states that the tax return  submitted  online
    to the HMRC for the year ending 5th April 2013 confirmed a net  profit,
    after expenses from the business where the Appellant was self-employed,
    of �8,443.

14. However, in addition to this, the Sponsor had been working in a grocery
    for the same employer and he had  an  annual  gross  salary,  which  is
    confirmed in his P60, of �11,475.37.  Therefore, his combined  earnings
    from employment and self-employment for the year ending 5th April  2013
    is �19,918.37.  On a balance of probabilities, therefore, the Appellant
    has met the requirements of the Rules and this appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

16. No anonymity order is made.
