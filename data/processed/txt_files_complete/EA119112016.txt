Representation:

For the appellant:         Ms C Record, of Counsel.
For the respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                           Decision and Directions



 1. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ford granted the appellant, a national
    of the Gambia born on 1 October 1990, permission to appeal the decision
    of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal C A S  O'Garro  who  dismissed  his
    appeal against the respondent's decision of 2 September 2016 to  refuse
    his application as an extended family member for an EEA  family  permit
    in order to join Bouly Diaby, a French national (the "sponsor"), in the
    United  Kingdom  under  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006 (hereafter the "EEA Regulations").

 2. The respondent refused to grant an EEA Family permit for the  following
    reasons:

    (i)  the appellant  had  not  established  his  relationship  with  his
    sponsor; and

    (ii) he had not established his dependency on the sponsor.

 3. Judge O'Garro dismissed the appeal on the ground  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to decide the appeal of an  extended
    family member under  the  EEA  Regulations.   In  this  respect,  Judge
    O'Garro relied upon Sala (EFMs: Right  of  appeal)  [2016]  UKUT  00411
    (IAC).

 4. At the hearing, Ms Ahmad requested me to adjourn the hearing  to  await
    the decision of the Supreme Court in SM (Algeria) in which the issue of
    whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and   the   Upper   Tribunal   have
    jurisdiction to decide appeals from extended family members  under  the
    EEA  regulations  arises  in  connection  with  the   Supreme   Court's
    jurisdiction to hear the appeal to it.

 5. I refused the adjournment request,  having  regard  to  the  overriding
    objective and the fact that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Khan
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 is binding  upon  the  Upper  Tribunal  until  and
    unless the principle it decided is held by  the  Supreme  Court  to  be
    wrong.

 6. I therefore proceeded to decide the appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 7. It is clear from the Court of Appeal's judgment in Khan that the First-
    tier Tribunal and  the  Upper  Tribunal  have  jurisdiction  to  decide
    appeals from extended family members under the EEA  Regulations.  I  am
    therefore satisfied that, through no fault of her  own,  Judge  O'Garro
    materially erred in law in dismissing the appellant's appeal  for  want
    of jurisdiction. I am satisfied that this led  Judge  O'Garro  to  fall
    into the error of not deciding the disputed facts in  this  appeal,  as
    summarised at my para 2 above.

 8. I therefore set aside the decision of Judge O'Garro in its entirety.

 9. In the majority of cases, the Upper Tribunal  when  setting  aside  the
    decision will re-make the relevant decision itself.  However, para  7.2
    of the Practice Statements for the Immigration and Asylum  Chambers  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal   (the   "Practice
    Statements") recognises that it may  not  be  possible  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to proceed to re-make the decision when it is satisfied that:

         "(a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal."

10. In my judgment this case falls within both para 7.2  (a)  and  (b).  In
    addition, having regard to the Court of Appeal's judgment in JD (Congo)
    & Others [2012] EWCA Civ 327, I am of the view that a remittal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal is the right course of action.

Notice of Decision


The decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  O'Garro  involved  the
making of a material error of law such that  the  decision  to  dismiss  the
appeal for want of jurisdiction is set aside.

This case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing on  the
merits on all issues by a judge other than Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
O'Garro.
