For the Appellant:      Mr S Ahmad instructed by Khans Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and born on 21st March 1989.  He
    made an application on 22nd November  2013  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 General (Student).  Under paragraph  245ZX  of  the
    Immigration Rules he was required in part to show he was in  possession
    of �1,600 for a consecutive 28 day period, that period ending on a date
    no earlier than one month prior to the application.  On  20th  November
    2013 the bank statement he submitted showed a balance of �1,432.70  and
    his application was therefore refused.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Morrison dismissed the appellant's appeal  on
    6th June 2014 because the appellant had failed to  show  the  requisite
    funds for the requisite period.  The appellant had  maintained  at  the
    appeal that he sent his Halifax Bank statements  with  the  application
    form but also sent bank statement from Barclays Bank. The judge did not
    accept that and decided the appellant  therefore had not shown  he  had
    the required funds.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    judge had erred in law because he had not given sufficient  reasons  as
    to why the appellant would not have submitted his bank  statement  from
    Barclays, as he claimed,  given  that  he  gave  clear  and  consistent
    evidence as to why he did not mention the Barclays  bank  statement  in
    the cover letter dated 22nd November 2013.

 4. In the alternative the judge should have allowed the appeal  under  the
    common law  duty  of  fairness.   The  appellant  recognised  that  the
    respondent had no duty to rectify defects in the  application  but  the
    appellant had paid �406 for his application and he had  an  expectation
    that if further evidence was required he could be contacted.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Simpson  of  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal.

Conclusions

 6. The Immigration Rules specify that the appellant must demonstrate  that
    funds are available for the 28 day period prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application (Appendix C) and in this instance the period ran from  25th
    October 2013 to 21st November 2013.  The balance in the account fell to
    �1,432.70 on 20th  November 2013.  The rules state under 1A of Appendix
    C that the end date of the 28 day period will be taken as the  date  of
    the closing balance on the most recent of the specified documents (bank
    statements).  In this case it was 21st November 2013.

 7. Quite simply the judge came to the conclusion at [17] that he  did  not
    accept that the appellant sent  the  Barclays  Bank  statement  to  the
    respondent with the application on 22nd  November  2013  and  thus  the
    respondent was under no duty, further to paragraph  245AA,  to  request
    further information.  The judge clearly set out his reasoning at  [17].
    He found the covering letter, dated 22nd November  2013,  sent  by  the
    appellant to the respondent with the application did not refer  to  the
    Barclays Bank statement. The judge recorded that if the appellant  knew
    when he sent in the application that there was  a  shortfall  he  would
    have amended the letter or copied the statements he said he  sent  with
    the letter.  He did neither.  These were the reasons the judge gave for
    not accepting the appellant's claim that he submitted, in  addition  to
    the  Halifax  statements  which  revealed  a  shortfall,  the  Barclays
    statement which would have corrected the shortfall.  There was no error
    of law in the judge's reasoning or in the adequacy of that reasoning.

 8. The judge considered whether the treatment was unfair and found it  was
    not.  The appellant was aware of the requirements for  maintenance  and
    indeed  the  judge  recorded  the  appellant  confirmed  in   his   own
    application he had �1,600 available to him.

 9. The authorities passed to me of Patel (revocation  of  sponsor  licence
    -fairness ) India [2011] UKUT 00211 IA  and  Naved  (Student   Fairness
    notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14 (IAC)  can  be  distinguished  on  the
    basis that in those cases there was no culpability on the part  of  the
    appellant.  In this case it was the responsibility of the appellant  to
    ensure that he had the funds in his account which he said  he  did.  In
    fact he did not.  The judge found that the  appellant  simply  did  not
    check the details of his Halifax account [18].  It is unfortunate  that
    the appellant was only short of the relevant funds for one day  but  as
    the judge correctly cites,  Patel and Others  v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  72
    brooks no near miss arguments.

10. The application is merely a disagreement  with  the  judge's  findings.
    There was no material error of law and the determination shall stand.
