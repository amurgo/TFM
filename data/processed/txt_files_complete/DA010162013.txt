    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Mr P Bonavero of
           counsel instructed by Trott and Gentry LLP
          For the Respondent: Mr G Saunders a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia who  was  born  on  23  February
      1987. He has been given permission to appeal the  determination  of  a
      panel (First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Moore  and  non-legal  member  Mr  G
      Sandall) which dismissed his appeal against the respondent's  decision
      of 17 May 2013 to refuse to revoke the deportation order made  against
      him on 5 July 2012, to grant him asylum or leave to  remain  on  human
      rights grounds.


   2. The appellant arrived in the UK on 11 December 2003  when  he  was  16
      years of age. In the light of later DNA testing the respondent has now
      accepted that he is the son of his claimed father and a member of  the
      Bravanese minority clan.  The  appellant  has  lived  here  since  his
      arrival. All his immediate family  live  here  including  his  mother,
      father and brother. The appellant claimed to have a daughter M born in
      March 2011. He was no longer in a relationship with her  mother,  Miss
      S.


   3. The appellant applied for asylum on 16 December 2003.  On  4  February
      2004 his claim was refused. He appealed and his appeal  was  dismissed
      as being out of time on  10  June  2004.  The  appellant  applied  for
      judicial review on 17 March 2005. There was a hearing on  13  December
      2006 after which his appeal was declared invalid on 8 January 2007.


   4. On 30 June 2008 at Waltham Forest Magistrates Court the appellant  was
      convicted of possessing a  Class  C  controlled  drug,  cannabis,  and
      failing to surrender to custody. He received a  six-month  conditional
      discharge, was fined �50 and ordered to pay �70 costs.


   5. On 4 October  2010  at  Snaresbrook  Crown  Court  the  appellant  was
      convicted on four counts of  supplying  a  Class  A  controlled  drug,
      heroin. He was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment.


   6. On 29 October 2011 the appellant's representatives  submitted  further
      representations  including  a  fresh  asylum  claim  and  claims   for
      protection under Articles 2, 3 and 8.  On  17  November  2011  he  was
      served with a notice of liability to automatic deportation. The asylum
      claim was refused on 16 April 2012 and on 5 July 2012  he  was  served
      with a deportation order. The appellant appealed. His appeal was heard
      by Designated Immigration  Judge  Woodcraft  who  in  a  determination
      promulgated on 22 October 2012 dismissed his appeal.  On  13  November
      2012 permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted.  In  the
      determination promulgated on 1 February 2013 the decision  to  dismiss
      the deportation order was upheld. On 14 February  2013  the  appellant
      sought permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal which  was  refused
      on 27 February 2013.


   7. On 14 March 2013 the  appellant's  representatives  submitted  further
      representations including a DNA test.  They  asked  for  these  to  be
      considered as a fresh application for asylum. The  respondent  treated
      this is a request to revoke the deportation order  which  led  to  the
      decision of 17 May 2013.


   8. The panel heard the appeal  on  9  October  2013.  Both  parties  were
      represented, the appellant by Mr Bonavero who appears before me.


   9. The panel recorded that it was now accepted that the appellant was the
      son of his father and a member of the minority Brava clan.  The  panel
      agreed  with  the  respondent's  earlier  conclusion   that   evidence
      submitted by the appellant had rebutted the presumption that he was  a
      danger to the community.

  10. The panel found that the appellant had not  established  that  he  was
      subjected to attacks  in  Somalia  because  of  his  membership  of  a
      minority clan, as he had claimed. The panel referred to  the  findings
      made by the Designated Immigration Judge in the earlier appeal hearing
      and concluded in paragraph 46 that his credibility was  "fundamentally
      flawed". He had not established that he was entitled to asylum or that
      he would be at risk of serious harm if he  was  returned  to  Somalia.
      Returning him would not pose a real risk of infringing his  Article  3
      human rights. The panel went on to consider the Article 8 human rights
      of the appellant and his daughter  M  finding  that  they  were  in  a
      genuine and subsisting relationship. She was a British citizen and  it
      would be unreasonable to expect her to  leave  the  UK.  However,  she
      could be cared for by her mother. The panel dismissed the appeal.


  11. The appellant applied for and was granted permission to  appeal  by  a
      judge in the First-Tier Tribunal. The grounds  argue  that  the  panel
      erred in law by making a flawed approach to serious harm as defined by
      Article 15 (c) of the Qualification Directive, made flawed findings of
      credibility by relying too heavily on the findings of  the  Designated
      Immigration Judge in the earlier appeal and adopting a flawed approach
      to the best interests of his daughter.


  12. I find that the panel erred in law by  confusing  Articles  15(b)  and
      (c). As appears from paragraph 15 the panel appreciated that the claim
      was being brought under Article 15 (c). Mr Saunders accepted that  the
      panel might have done so but submitted that this would not  have  made
      any difference. The threshold was not so different that the  appellant
      would have succeeded on either basis. I do not agree. AMM  and  others
      (conflict; humanitarian crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011] UKUT
      00445 (IAC) states, at paragraph 4 of the summary;


         "Despite the suggestion in the judgment in Sufi & Elmi  that  there
         is no difference in the scope of, on the one hand, Article 3 of the
         ECHR (and, thus, Article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive) and,
         on  the  other,  Article  15(c)  of  the  Directive,  the   binding
         Luxembourg case law of Elgafaji [2009] EUECJ C-465/07 (as  well  as
         the binding domestic authority of QD (Iraq) [2009]  EWCA  Civ  620)
         makes it plain that Article 15(c) can be  satisfied  without  there
         being such a level of risk as is required for Article 3 in cases of
         generalised  violence  (having  regard  to   the   high   threshold
         identified in NA v United Kingdom [2008] ECHR 616). The  difference
         appears to involve the fact that, as the  CJEU  found  at  [33]  of
         Elgafaji, Article 15(c) covers a "more general risk of  harm"  than
         does Article 3 of the ECHR; that Article 15(c)  includes  types  of
         harm that are less severe than those encompassed by Article 3;  and
         that the language indicating a  requirement  of  exceptionality  is
         invoked for different purposes in NA v United Kingdom and  Elgafaji
         respectively."


  13. In paragraph 46 the panel found that the appellant would  not  have  a
      well founded fear of persecution in his home area and as a result,  in
      paragraph 47, that he was not entitled to  asylum.  Immediately  after
      and in the same paragraph the panel said that his  removal  would  not
      cause  the  UK  to  be  in  breach  of  its  obligations   under   the
      "Qualification Regulations". There is no indication that  a  different
      test was applied, as it should have been. In paragraph  48  the  panel
      referred to the lack of "a risk of serious harm" and that as a  result
      the appellant claim to humanitarian protection did not  succeed.  This
      indicates that the panel was considering Article 15 (b)  not  15  (c).
      The only suggestion of any separate consideration of Article 15 (c) is
      in paragraph 45. However, this is done  in  the  context  of  findings
      relating to the appellants claim under the Refugee Convention and does
      not amount to a clear 15 (c) conclusion which can be set  against  the
      flawed reasoning in paragraph 48. I do not agree with the grounds that
      suggest that the panel's reasoning  in  paragraph  45  amounted  to  a
      "perfect inversion" of the Tribunal's country guidance in AMM.


  14. I find that the panel did not err in law by relying too heavily on the
      findings of the Designated Immigration Judge  in  the  earlier  appeal
      hearing. It  was  not  said  that  Devaseelan  principles  were  being
      followed or that the panel took his findings as their starting  point.
      In the determination the panel recorded the  important  matters  which
      had changed including the concessions  made  by  the  respondent.  The
      panel were entitled to rely on the matters referred to in paragraph 40
      which had not changed and still amounted to valid  criticisms  of  the
      appellant's  credibility.  The  reference  in  paragraph  52  to   the
      appellant not wishing to see his daughter whilst he was  in  detention
      was, if it was an error of fact, not a material error in  the  context
      of the evidence that she never went to see him whilst he was in prison
      and only once whilst he was in immigration detention.


  15. However, I find that the panel made an  error  of  law  by  making  no
      findings of fact or credibility in relation to the evidence of Miss S,
      the appellant's, father, mother or brother. In paragraph 58 the  panel
      records that they gave oral evidence. I have  seen  the  hand  written
      record of proceedings prepared by the First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  who
      presided over the panel which sets out  their  evidence.  This  is  an
      important error of law. Their evidence went to the question of whether
      there was any other  family  in  Somalia  and  information  about  the
      appellant's relationship with his daughter. In paragraph 58 the  panel
      referred to the evidence given by the appellant's  family  members  to
      the Designated Immigration Judge but there is no reference or findings
      in relation to the evidence given to the panel.


  16. I find that the panel erred in the approach to future contact  between
      the appellant and his daughter in the statement; "the appellant  could
      maintain any relationship with M by telephone or letter  or  by  other
      modern methods of communication" in the light of what is said  by  the
      President in LD (Article 8 best interests of  child)  Zimbabwe  [2010]
      UKUT 278 (IAC).


  17. The panel did not make an anonymity direction. I consider it necessary
      make such a direction  in  order  to  protect  the  interests  of  the
      appellant's young daughter.


  18. I make an order  under  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any
      matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the appellant,
      his daughter, her mother or any member of his family.


  19. Having found that the panel erred in law I set aside the decision.  In
      the light of my conclusions as to the lack of findings of  credibility
      or fact in relation to four witnesses the panel's findings of fact are
      not preserved. Bearing in mind the  Senior  President's  directions  I
      direct that the appeal be re-determined in the First-Tier Tribunal.
