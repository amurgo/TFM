Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr J Waithe, counsel (instructed by Fadozai
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan, born on 10  November  1993.
    His appeal against the respondent's decision to grant him further leave
    to remain in the UK dated 19 September 2014 was dismissed by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Ruth in a determination  promulgated  on  27  May  2015.
    Judge Ruth dismissed his appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection  and
    human rights grounds.

 2. The appellant appeals with leave granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Landes in a decision dated 23 June 2015. Judge Landes did not  consider
    that there was any merit in Ground 2 where it was argued that the Judge
    erred in finding that the appellant would not  be  at  risk  of  forced
    recruitment by insurgents in his home area.  Judge  Landes  found  that
    Judge Ruth had explained fully and carefully why he was departing  from
    the earlier decision of the Tribunal dated 24 July 2006  and  the  2013
    decision relating to the appellant's brother and why there was  at  the
    highest a mere possibility of forced recruitment in his home  area.  He
    had explained why the appellant would not be at risk in Kabul  in  this
    respect.

 3. Ground 1 was arguable because the Judge  overlooked  considerations  of
    the expert's point relating to the risk to the appellant of  kidnap  on
    return, or that he did not give adequate  reasons  for  so  doing.  The
    country guidance cases did not explicitly consider the risk  of  kidnap
    to those returning from Europe. Even though it  may  be  said  that  it
    would have been considered if it were a significant risk  to  returning
    asylum seekers, Judge  Landes  did  not  consider  that  the  point  is
    unarguable.

     Background to the appeal

 4. The appellant arrived in the UK on 4 May 2006  when  he  was  about  12
    years old. His application for asylum was refused in June 2006  but  he
    was granted discretionary leave on account of  his  age  until  7  June
    2009. There had been no interview by the respondent.

 5. His upgrade appeal was dismissed on 18 July 2006. His  application  for
    further leave to remain was lodged on 12 May 2009. However, no decision
    on that application was made until 19 September  2014.  The  respondent
    refused the application under paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules. There were no reasons justifying a grant outside the
    rules.

 6. The appellant appealed that decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
    asylum, humanitarian protection and on human rights grounds.

 7. Judge Ruth had regard to the  respondent's  reasons  for  refusing  the
    appellant's application  for  further  leave  in  2014.  There  was  no
    additional information that had  been  provided  since  the  claim  for
    asylum nine years before. He would not presently be at risk.

 8. The Judge had regard to his Article 8 claim. There  was  no  dependency
    beyond normal emotional ties with his brothers in the UK.  Those  could
    be maintained through modern means of  communication  and  visits.  His
    private life had  been  established  through  employment  and  academic
    studies but was of a type which could be re-established in Afghanistan.



 9. Any interference with his private life would be  proportionate  in  the
    circumstances.

10. The respondent had regard to the suitability  of  the  appellant  being
    granted  leave  to  remain,  including  his  character,   conduct   and
    associations.  He  had  been  convicted  of  four  offences   including
    possession of cannabis, shoplifting and robbery. There was also  police
    information that he had been involved  in  further  nefarious  activity
    including possession of an offensive  weapon,  handling  stolen  goods,
    attempted robbery, robbery and kidnapping of a child.

11. His character and conduct were unacceptable and it was conducive to the
    public good that he should not be granted leave.

12. At the hearing before Judge Ruth, the appellant submitted a  bundle  of
    documents as well as witness statements from himself and both  brothers
    in the UK. There was also  an  expert  report  into  the  situation  in
    Afghanistan prepared by Mr Jawad  Hassan  Zadeh.  The  Judge  also  had
    regard to the respondent's bundle including statements  from  Detective
    Constable Turney of the Metropolitan Police Force.  There  was  also  a
    further witness statement  and  an  additional  extract  from  the  PNC
    reflecting an additional allegation regarding the  appellant's  further
    alleged nefarious activities which came to light after the  refusal  of
    his application.

13. The Judge heard evidence from the appellant  speaking  through  a  Dari
    interpreter. He also heard oral evidence  from  the  appellant's  older
    brother.

14. The elder brother's evidence substantially differed from that given  by
    the appellant. During the hearing it became clear that the  appellant's
    representative (who was not Mr Waithe) was surprised  by  the  evidence
    and was in some difficulty. As a result the Judge gave the  appellant's
    representative the opportunity to take further  instructions  from  the
    appellant, given the new information provided by his elder brother.

15. It became evident on resumption that the appellant had been speaking to
    his brothers outside the hearing centre despite  the  Judge's  explicit
    instructions not to do so.

16. The Judge nevertheless allowed the recall of  the  appellant  informing
    the parties that given the situation which had arisen, it was  unlikely
    that any weight could be given to an  explanation  that  the  appellant
    might now give [51].

17. In his  initial  oral  evidence  relating  to  the  asylum  claim,  the
    appellant said that he had grown up with his parents,  younger  brother
    and elder sister. He repeated  his  claim  that  his  father  had  been
    fighting against the Americans when he disappeared in 2005  (presumably
    in battle) [56]. He knew that his father was a commander.

18. The maternal uncle took the family  to  his  own  home  to  hide  them.
    Government soldiers visited and threatened  the  family,  "hitting  the
    appellant and his mother." [57]

19. They were looking for his father. His uncle concluded that  the  family
    was not safe and took them to Pakistan, after which the appellant  left
    for the UK in 2005.

20. After arrival in the UK, the appellant stated that his younger  brother
    who had arrived in the UK himself,  that  the  authorities  were  still
    looking for the appellant. The  appellant  also  said  that  his  older
    brother in the UK told him that their mother was missing  around  three
    or four years ago. He confirmed that  his  elder  brother  had  visited
    Pakistan and confirmed in cross examination that he had  not  travelled
    to see family.

21. The appellant contended that he would be of interest to the authorities
    in Afghanistan as a result of his father's previous activity [60].

22. The appellant's elder brother gave evidence as to why he  came  to  the
    UK. The Taliban had come to the  village  and  spoken  to  the  mullah,
    requesting that all local young men should join them.  His  father  was
    away fighting jihad at the time and  his  uncle  arranged  for  him  to
    travel out of Afghanistan to safety.

23. His elder brother stated that he subsequently heard from the  appellant
    that their father had died of cancer and  that  their  mother  was  ill
    [62].

24. When asked to explain the circumstances of  the  appellant's  departure
    from Afghanistan, the elder brother stated that the appellant had  told
    him that he had been working with a butcher in  the  local  bazaar  and
    this butcher had made sexual advances towards him.  When  he  told  his
    mother, she and the uncle decided it was not safe for him to remain and
    that is why he left Afghanistan.

25. Moreover, the appellant's elder brother stated that the appellant  told
    him that he did not wish  to  return  to  Afghanistan  because  he  had
    studied here and wanted to remain in the UK.  Furthermore,  the  father
    was dead and the family had no recent  contact  with  the  mother.  The
    appellant told him that the  reason  he  did  not  wish  to  return  to
    Afghanistan was because he  was  afraid  of  the  butcher,  who  was  a
    powerful person.

26. When recalled to  give  evidence,  the  appellant  said  that  he  left
    Afghanistan to escape from the government as well as to escape from the
    butcher. He was too embarrassed to mention that but repeated his  claim
    that government soldiers had come looking for his father and his mother
    was scared that they might take the appellant. He stated that his uncle
    had three daughters and one son. It was  put  to  him  that  his  elder
    brother had said that his uncle had no children, he  stated  that  that
    was not correct [68].

27. The police evidence set out the appellant's criminal activity.

28. In his findings and reasons relating to international  protection,  the
    Judge had regard to the respondent's COIs report as well as operational
    guidance notes and UNHCR reports, and  the  relevant  country  guidance
    cases such as PM and Others; RQ (Afghanistan); HK and Others (Minors  -
    indiscriminate evidence - Forced recruitment by Taliban - contact  with
    family members) [2010]; AA (Unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012];
    and AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012]. He noted that there could
    clearly be potentially disastrous consequences for the appellant if  he
    concluded that he is not in need of international protection when he is
    in fact in such need. He stated that he had given most anxious scrutiny
    to this case.

29. The Judge decided to depart from the  findings  made  by  the  previous
    Tribunal in 2006, having concluded that the appellant could be given no
    credence in relation to any of  his  claims.  The  Judge  set  out  his
    reasons for such a departure.  There  has  been  no  challenge  to  the
    Judge's departure from the 2006 determination. I am satisfied that  the
    Judge has given proper reasons justifying that departure,  set  out  at
    paragraph 101.

30. The Judge in assessing the appellant's credibility  noted  serious  and
    material discrepancies not only within the account  given  by  him  but
    also between the account given by the appellant and that given  by  his
    brothers [102].

31. This included the make up of the appellant's family, which called  into
    question these  three  "brothers"  and  whether  they  are  related  as
    claimed.

32. The appellant stated that his  family  was  made  up  of  his  parents,
    himself, his younger brother and one sister. He made no mention  of  an
    elder brother or of two additional  sisters.  Given  that  the  alleged
    elder brother only  left  Afghanistan  about  three  years  before  the
    appellant, the Judge found it surprising that he was unable  to  recall
    either during 2006 or  during  the  hearing  in  adopting  his  witness
    statement that he had an elder brother in Afghanistan. [104]

33. His younger brother said in  his  witness  statement  provided  to  the
    Tribunal in 2013 that he lived with his mother and  three  sisters.  He
    did not mention having two other brothers  who  left  Afghanistan  many
    years before. There was however the fact of his  having  three  sisters
    rather than one which was "very strange" in the context of  the  family
    background discussed by the appellant himself. [105]

34. The appellant stated that he had no contact with his  mother  and  that
    she was missing for around four years.  He  stated  that  although  his
    elder brother travelled overseas, he had  not  done  so  to  visit  any
    family member.

35. However, the elder brother stated that  in  2013,  he  heard  that  his
    mother was ill in Pakistan. He travelled there and spent 45  days  with
    her. The younger brother stated that he had spoken to his mother  about
    six months before.  These  contradictory  accounts  contribute  to  the
    Judge's conclusion that the appellant had not told him the truth. [108]

36. Another serious and material discrepancy was found to exist as  to  the
    explanations given by the three brothers relating to the cause of death
    of their father. The appellant was the  only  one  to  claim  that  his
    father died in battle  in  2005,  fighting  the  Americans.  The  other
    brothers stated that the father died of an  illness  described  by  the
    elder brother as cancer. The failure of the three alleged  brothers  to
    give a coherent account of the death of their father,  particularly  in
    the light of the nature of the asylum claims of the two other brothers,
    led to the conclusion that there  was  a  strong  indication  that  the
    appellant is not a truthful witness [109].

37. The Judge referred to the submission that all three brothers had  given
    similar  accounts  which  lent  support  to  the  credibility  of   the
    appellant's claim that he is in danger as  a  result  of  his  father's
    background as a former member of the Taliban.

38. The Judge had regard to the expert report which he  had  no  reason  to
    dispute. He described the alleged events which took place according  to
    the appellant as plausible in the context of a person related to such a
    father. The Judge agreed that the events are plausible  but  that  this
    did not mean that they are true. Their  plausibility  depended  on  the
    appellant's claims as  to  his  father's  background  and  death  being
    credible.

39. An examination of the asylum claims of the elder  and  younger  brother
    reveals that they are  not  similar  to  that  of  the  appellant.  The
    appellant's claim was very particular. He had stated that it was  as  a
    result of his father's past as a  commander  with  150  men  under  his
    personal control and the interest shown by the government  soldiers  in
    finding him following his death in battle with the Americans  that  he,
    the appellant, would be at risk.

40. The elder brother's claim, however, was  not  that  his  father's  past
    activities, rank or position placed him at risk.  His  claim  was  that
    members of the Taliban had come to the village and asked the mullah  to
    gather all the young men in the area for recruitment  to  the  Taliban.
    That is why he fled, to avoid the Taliban recruitment and not to  avoid
    harm as a result of his father's profile [112].

41. The younger brother's claim was that he had been studying in a madrassa
    when he  and  two  other  boys  went  voluntarily  with  a  mullah  who
    subsequently turned out to be a member of the Taliban. He was taken  to
    a training camp. From there, he escaped. He did not claim that his fear
    related to past profile and activities of his father.

42. The Judge noted that if the father died of cancer rather than dying  in
    battle as two of the three brothers  have  said,  it  is  difficult  to
    understand why government soldiers would have come looking for  him  as
    claimed by the appellant. The younger brother had said that  after  the
    death of his father which he described as being a long  time  ago,  the
    family worked on the land which they owned with the assistance of their
    maternal uncle. That was completely different from what  the  appellant
    said. He claimed that the family had no resources after  the  death  of
    the father and that they had to move in with and rely upon the maternal
    uncle who assisted them. [114]

43. The Judge also noted the discrepancy relating to  the  uncle's  family.
    The appellant claimed that he had three daughters and one son and  that
    because he had his own children, it was necessary for the appellant  to
    go out and work. The older brother stated that the uncle had been in  a
    position to assist the family after the death of the father as  he  had
    no children of his own [115].

44. The Judge identified what he called the most serious discrepancy in the
    evidence. The appellant's claim was that he fled  Afghanistan  and  did
    not wish to return because of his father's  background  and  government
    interest shown in his father, resulting in both he and his mother being
    beaten. That was what the appellant stated in 2006 and was the  account
    he gave when initially giving evidence before Judge Ruth.

45. That account was however "fatally undermined" by the  evidence  of  the
    elder brother who stated that when he met the appellant in the UK  that
    the appellant gave the reason why he left Afghanistan  was  because  of
    sexual approaches  made  against  him  by  a  butcher  in  the  bazaar.
    Moreover, he had stated that he did not wish to leave the UK because he
    had studied and settled here. There was no suggestion  from  the  older
    brother of anything similar to the reasons  for  flight  given  by  the
    appellant himself [117].

46. The Judge found that it was significant that the appellant had not seen
    fit to state to his alleged elder brother that he fled Afghanistan as a
    result of interest shown in the family by government soldiers  visiting
    the uncle's house. He gave a completely different account to his  elder
    brother and appeared not to have corrected it even at the point of  his
    own appeal against the refusal of asylum [118].

47. Furthermore, the appellant had been in the UK for almost a  decade  and
    is now in his 20s. He has  been  legally  represented  throughout  that
    period. He has been in close contact with the local  authority,  social
    workers and foster parents. It did not appear that  the  appellant  had
    ever mentioned these events to anyone other than his brother [119].

48. The Judge accepted that a child experiencing sexual  advances  of  this
    kind might be embarrassed. He noted that nothing had actually  happened
    apart from advances. Accordingly, the Judge accepted that it  might  be
    difficult to discuss such matters, at least initially.

49. However, the Judge did not accept that when he was a child in  2006  or
    an adult such as he now is, he would not have mentioned  to  his  elder
    brother what he asserts to be the real reason for  his  departure  from
    Afghanistan; risk as a result of his father's activity if that had been
    the reason for his departure [121].

50. It was also very damaging that the appellant  told  his  elder  brother
    that the real reason he did not  wish  to  return  to  Afghanistan  was
    because he had studied in the UK and has settled here. If the appellant
    were afraid of his father's profile, it was inconceivable that he would
    never have mentioned that to his elder brother [122].

51. Neither the elder brother,  nor  the  younger,  has  expressed  similar
    fears. That seemed to the Judge to constitute a clear  indication  that
    the appellant's claims about his reasons for flight and fear of  return
    as given up to the point of his elder brother's evidence  to  him  were
    simply untrue [123].

52. There was accordingly too much uncertainty, too many discrepancies  and
    too much falsity in the appellant's account  to  enable  the  Judge  to
    conclude that any credence can be attached  to  anything  he  has  said
    [124].

53. The  Judge  stated  that  in  reaching  that  conclusion,  he  has  not
    disregarded the expert report. That report however  gives  the  opinion
    that the events claimed by the appellant are plausible in  the  context
    of a father with the background claimed. However, the appellant is  not
    such a person in much of the discussion and  the  report  simply  falls
    away. [125]

54. The Judge accordingly was able to find that the appellant is an  Afghan
    national born on 10 November 1993. There is nothing  else  known  about
    him although it is not disputed that he comes from Nangarhar province.

55. The Judge then considered the potential future harm, having  regard  to
    the accepted profile of the appellant  when  compared  to  guidance  in
    various cases including the background information.

56. In assessing the question, he had careful regard to the guidance in  HK
    and Others (CG), supra. The question is whether the risk of recruitment
    is a mere possibility, or may  be  a  real  risk  for  this  particular
    appellant.

57. The Judge found that the only thing established is that  the  appellant
    comes from this area. Nothing else in the profile realistically  raises
    the prospect of anything  other  than  a  mere  possibility  of  forced
    recruitment. Given his lack of any particular background or profile, it
    is not clear or established why government  authorities  in  the  local
    area would have any adverse interest in him, particularly given that on
    the accepted evidence, the authorities have shown no  interest  in  the
    past. Nor had either of the two  brothers  suggested  any  difficulties
    with the authorities in their asylum claims [133].

58. The Judge noted that even if he  is  wrong  in  that  respect  and  the
    appellant is at risk  in  his  own  home  area,  he  could  safely  and
    reasonably relocate to another part of Afghanistan. The  only  possible
    area of relocation would be  Kabul  [135-136].  The  only  profile  the
    appellant has is that of a person from  his  home  province.  There  is
    nothing to distinguish him from others and the country  guidance  cases
    are clear. In such a situation, he  would  not  face  a  real  risk  of
    serious harm in Kabul [136].

59. The Judge had regard to whether it  would  be  reasonable  for  him  to
    relocate to Kabul and whether it would not be unduly harsh. The country
    guidance  authority  suggested  that  a  healthy  adult  such  as   the
    appellant, given his education in the UK, would be able to survive  and
    live a relatively normal life judged by local standards [137].

60. The Judge had regard to the expert report which  set  out  a  different
    view, considering that the appellant would not be able  to  survive  to
    the appropriate level in Kabul and may  be  at  risk  of  exploitation.
    However, the Judge preferred the information contained in  the  country
    guidance cases on the basis that the Tribunal has had regard to a  very
    wide ranging amount of background  information  from  various  sources,
    including a number of well known experts, and those cases  continue  to
    bind him [138]. He therefore  declined  to  depart  from  the  guidance
    contained in the country guidance cases, finding that the appellant can
    reasonably and safely relocate to Kabul [140].

61. Nor was the level of indiscriminate violence in Kabul sufficiently high
    to justify humanitarian protection.

62. The Judge accordingly found that his return would not involve a  breach
    of his rights under Articles 2 and 3 of  the  Human  Rights  Convention
    [145].

Submissions

63. Mr Waithe referred to the expert report at paragraph 30, page 77 of the
    bundle.  However,  as  already  noted,  the  expert  stated  that   the
    appellant's  case  is  consistent  and  plausible  in  the  context  of
    Afghanistan. However, the Judge having heard all  the  evidence,  found
    that the appellant had not shown that  he  is  a  family  member  of  a
    Taliban  commander  and  is  at  risk  of  prosecution  by  the  Afghan
    government. Mr Waithe also had regard to paragraph 43 where  conditions
    in Kabul in  the  absence  of  a  well  connected  and  well  resourced
    immediate and extended family would mean that he would have to live  in
    an inn, where there are squalid and  unhygienic  conditions.  There  is
    much sexual exploitation of men by men.

64. He also referred to paragraph 53 of the report  where  it  is  asserted
    that for a person to survive in Kabul or  other  Afghan  provinces,  he
    must have immediate and extended family members  who  are  willing  and
    capable of providing support. This would not apply to the appellant.

65. Mr Waithe also referred to paragraph 13.17 in the Home  Office  country
    information and guidance report,  dated  February  2015,  where  it  is
    stressed that  in  all  cases,  consideration  must  be  given  to  the
    relevance and reasonableness of internal relocation on a case  by  case
    basis. He also referred to the Danish immigration service report of May
    2012 (paragraph 2.5.6). The police are considered  to  be  corrupt  and
    weak. Corruption is even higher in the big cities.

66. Mr Waithe also relied on the expert report regarding Afghans living  in
    the UK who are thought to be rich. He referred to paragraph 38  of  the
    expert's report where it is stated that a person such as the  appellant
    is at risk of being kidnapped throughout Afghanistan and remains a high
    and constant threat. The risk of kidnap for the Afghan who returns from
    Europe is very high.

67. The appellant has lived in the UK for  nearly  nine  years.  After  his
    arrival, his past in the UK either in Kabul  or  in  the  other  Afghan
    provinces will be known to the local residents. Such Afghans  who  have
    lived in the UK are thought to be very rich. It is asserted  that  some
    people visiting or returning from the UK or other parts of Europe  have
    been kidnapped for a reason of as little as �100.  In  some  cases  the
    person has been killed. The source  of  this  assertion  relates  to  a
    conversation with three Afghans who visited  Afghanistan  in  September
    2014, December 2014, and February 2015.

68. Mr Waithe also relied on ground 2 in which  it  is  asserted  that  the
    Judge dismissed the expert report without any justification, especially
    taking into consideration  that  the  appellant's  family  history  had
    already been accepted in his brother's determination.

69. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Tarlow submitted that there has been no
    material error in the determination.

70. He submitted that the Judge directed himself appropriately. The risk of
    kidnapping was a remote one and not one that met the  real  risk  test,
    especially in the light of the Judge's findings at paragraphs  133  and
    138.

71. Moreover, the Judge has stated expressly that he  has  not  disregarded
    the expert report. The Judge has  given  substantial  reasons  why  the
    appellant is not such a  person  as  claimed  by  him  in  the  report.
    Accordingly much of the discussion falls away.

72. The Judge moreover had regard to the country  guidance  cases,  finding
    that  although  the  expert  appeared  to  have  a  good  knowledge  of
    Afghanistan, this was not sufficient to displace the findings made over
    a period of several years by several country guidance cases.  There  is
    accordingly no basis for displacing the wide ranging sources  consulted
    by the Tribunal in those cases which led to the guidance in AK [144].

73. He submitted that that finding was open to the Judge having  looked  at
    the report in the light of the country guidance decisions.

     Assessment

74. I have set out the reasons and findings of the Judge who  has  given  a
    careful decision. He has explained in  great  detail  his  reasons  for
    departing from the 2006 determination. He has also given  full  reasons
    as to why, notwithstanding the decision in respect of  the  appellant's
    brother in 2013,  there  was  in  any  event  at  the  highest  a  mere
    possibility of forced recruitment in his home area. The Judge has fully
    explained why he would not be at risk in Kabul in that respect.

75. The Judge noted that his younger brother had claimed that he  had  been
    studying in a madrassa when he and two others  voluntarily  accompanied
    the mullah who subsequently turned out to be a member  of  the  Taliban
    and were taken to a Taliban training camp, from where  he  escaped.  He
    did not claim that his fear related to his past profile and  activities
    of his father. Moreover, two of the brothers  stated  that  the  father
    died of cancer rather than in battle against the Americans.

76. The Judge was accordingly entitled to find that  it  was  not  easy  to
    understand why the government soldiers would have come looking for  him
    as claimed by the appellant. His account differed entirely from that of
    the younger brother who stated that after the death of their father,  a
    long time ago, the family worked on the land which they owned with  the
    assistance of the uncle.

77. It is contended that although referring to the country guidance  cases,
    the Judge did not expressly consider the risk of  kidnap  addressed  by
    the experts. It is not clear, as noted  by  Judge  Landes  in  granting
    permission, whether it would have been considered by the Tribunal if it
    were a significant risk to returning asylum seekers.

78. I have had regard to the expert's  report  on  the  issue  of  risk  of
    getting kidnapped for those who return from  Europe.  It  is  contended
    that this is very high [paragraph 38 of the report].

79. The expert has asserted that some people visiting or returning from the
    UK or other parts of Europe have been  kidnapped  for  ransom,  for  as
    little as �100. In some cases, the person has been  killed.  The  basis
    for such  assertion  is  provided  by  footnote  42,  which  refers  to
    "conversation with three Afghans who visited Afghanistan  in  September
    2014, December 2014 and February 2015." However, no detail is given  as
    to where such kidnapping took place, nor when this took place.  Nor  is
    there  any  evidence  produced   relating   to   the   background   and
    circumstances of those who have  been  kidnapped,  nor  how  many  were
    involved. The author of the report has not set out the conversation  he
    had with the three Afghans.

80. The  evidence  presented  relating  to  the  risk  of  being  kidnapped
    throughout Afghanistan is sparse.

81. Judge Ruth has stated that he has "not disregarded the expert's report"
    [125]. He found that there was nothing in the appellant's profile  that
    realistically raises  the  prospect  of  anything  other  than  a  mere
    possibility of forced recruitment.

82. I find that the evidence relating to the possibility of  kidnapping  is
    so sparse and vague that the appellant did not  establish  through  the
    expert's report that he would face a real risk of serious harm  in  his
    home area. In any event, he could safely  and  reasonably  relocate  to
    another part of Afghanistan which would be the city of Kabul. His  only
    profile would be that he is a person from his home province.

83. In the circumstances, even assuming that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    erred in not expressly considering the risk of kidnap  referred  to  by
    the expert, I find that from the evidence produced in relation to  that
    risk, it has not been shown that there is or  would  be  a  significant
    risk to this appellant.

    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    any material error on a point of law. It shall accordingly stand.

    No anonymity direction is made.
