                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Sayeed, Counsel instructed by Wesley Gryk
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Paul to allow the respondent's appeal
    against the decision to refuse her application for leave to remain in
    the UK on the basis of her family life with her spouse.

 2. At the First-tier Tribunal hearing, the judge did not permit oral
    evidence to be given by the respondent, her husband or her mother-in-
    law.

 3. In the grounds of appeal the Secretary of State contends that failing
    to allow cross-examination of the aforementioned witnesses was a
    procedural error which prevented the Presenting Officer from fully
    engaging with and examining the evidence.

 4. In the respondent's Rule 24 response it is agreed that there was
    procedural unfairness in how the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal was
    conducted.

 5. At the error of law hearing the parties informed me that they were in
    agreement that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set
    aside on the basis that there was procedural unfairness in how the
    judge conducted the hearing. Both parties submitted that the appeal
    should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh.

 6. In light of the agreement between the parties that there has been
    procedural unfairness and that the appeal should be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal, I will set aside the decision and remit the appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by a different judge with no
    findings preserved.

Notice of Decision

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
    law and is set aside.

 8. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by a
    judge other than Judge N M Paul.

 9. No anonymity direction is made.
