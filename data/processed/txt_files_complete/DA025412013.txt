Representation:

For the Appellant:      Miss Frantzis, instructed by Howells, Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant,  WM,  was  born  in  1980  and  is  a  male  citizen  of
    Afghanistan.  He arrived in the United Kingdom in 2002.   In  2004,  he
    applied for leave to remain as a partner of  LM  (a  British  citizen).
    His application was refused on 18 February 2005.  On  13  August  2005,
    the appellant committed a sexual assault on a 14  year  old  girl.   In
    2006, the appellant  returned  to  Afghanistan  in  order  to  make  an
    application for entry clearance as the fiancï¿½ of LM.   At  this  stage,
    the Secretary of State was unaware of the  criminal  offending  of  the
    respondent and entry  clearance  was  granted  on  9  March  2006.   On
    29 September 2006, the appellant and LM married in the United Kingdom.
    Her first child (Z) was born in 2006 and her second child (K) was  born
    in 2008.

 2. On 24 December 2006, the appellant was  arrested  and  charged  with  a
    sexual assault upon  an  adult  woman.   On  8  February  2008  he  was
    sentenced to a total of 22 months' imprisonment (twenty months for  the
    sexual assault on the 14 year old girl; two months consecutive for  the
    sexual assault on the adult woman).

 3. A decision was made by the Secretary of State to deport  the  appellant
    to Afghanistan on 5 September 2008.  Problems arose in respect of  that
    decision which was ultimately withdrawn  by  the  respondent.   In  the
    meantime, the appellant, having been detained for immigration  purposes
    following his release from prison, returned to the family home  in  May
    2011 where he has remained living since that date.  A new  decision  to
    deport the appellant to Afghanistan was made on 28 November 2013.   The
    appellant appealed against that decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which allowed the appeal against  the  decision  to  deport  him  by  a
    determination promulgated on 9 May 2014.  Following an  appeal  by  the
    Secretary of State, that decision was upheld  by  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    However, in June 2016, the Court of  Appeal  allowed  the  respondent's
    appeal and remitted the matter  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    decision to be  made,  having  regard  in  particular  to  the  amended
    Immigration  Rules  and  Sections   117A-117D   of   the   Immigration,
    Nationality and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).  Following  a  number  of
    adjournments, the matter came before me at Bradford on 30 August  2018.



 4. The burden of proof in the appeal on Article 8, ECHR grounds  rests  on
    the appellant.  The standard of proof is the balance of  probabilities.



 5. The substantive law has changed since the First-tier Tribunal made  its
    decision allowing this appeal in May 2014.  The parties agree that  the
    relevant law now is that set out in Exception 2 (EX2 of the  2002  Act,
    Section 117C(5)):

     (5)  Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a qualifying partner, or  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the  effect  of  C's
    deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

    The appellant  gave  evidence  in  English.   He  adopted  his  written
    statements as his evidence-in-chief.  He explained  that  he  had  been
    designated the formal carer of the child Z some two  years  previously.
    He had given up work in order to look after Z.  Both Z and his sister K
    have been diagnosed as autistic (Z in March  2018  and  K  in  November
    2017).  The appellant explained that Z is now  "heavier  and  stronger"
    than he had been in the past and is aggressive towards his mother  (LM)
    and she is physically incapable of  controlling  him  when  he  becomes
    enraged.  Both children attend  different  schools  which  require  the
    parents, the appellant and LM, to travel with each child  in  different
    directions every day.  The appellant explained that it  is  simply  not
    possible for LM to provide daily  care  for  both  children.   This  is
    especially true in light of the difficulties arising from their autism.



 6. The appellant said that Z is particularly close to  the  appellant  and
    has said that he will attempt suicide if the appellant is removed  from
    the country.  Indeed, the diagnosis of autism for Z in March  2018  was
    undertaken  very  swiftly  after  medical  professionals   treating   Z
    considered that he was possibly suicidal.

 7. Cross-examined by Mr McVeety, the appellant said  that  his  father  in
    Afghanistan had died but he still had sisters and his mother living  in
    that country.  He stays in touch with his Afghan family by telephone.

 8. I heard evidence in English from LM, the wife of  the  appellant.   She
    adopted her written statements as her evidence-in-chief.  She confirmed
    that both children Z and  K  have  special  needs  arising  from  their
    autistic condition.  She said that A  was  better  able  to  control  Z
    because Z is now so strong that she cannot physically deal with him.

 9. Cross-examined, LM said that both children are  academically  able  but
    are demanding in school on account of their autistic conditions.  Z  in
    particular can become very anxious and unwilling to attend  school  and
    has to be "calmed down" by the  appellant.   LM  herself  suffers  from
    difficulties arising from a  2009  spinal  injury.   I  note  that  she
    entered the courtroom using crutches.

10. The Tribunal reserved its decision.

11. I acknowledge the force of Mr McVeety's submissions in this  case.   It
    is now agreed that the decision to deport is lawful and that there  was
    only a narrow issue for the Tribunal to determine  which  concerns  the
    application of EX2 (see  above).   Mr  McVeety  acknowledged  that  the
    appellant has not reoffended following his imprisonment.   However,  he
    drew attention to the decision of the Supreme Court in Ali [2016]  UKSC
    60.  At [69], the Supreme Court held:

    In para 14 above Lord Reed suggests that sections 32 and 33 of the 2007
    Act were enacted in response to public concern  about,  in  particular,
    the procedures for the deportation of  foreign  offenders.  But  it  is
    clear to me that there was equal, if not greater, dissatisfaction  with
    the decisions themselves, in particular when they rejected deportation.
    Why, in particular,  did  the  people  of  the  UK,  by  their  elected
    representatives, take the unusual step of  pre-empting  the  minister's
    decision whether a deportation was conducive  to  the  public  good  by
    making a formal resolution in section 32(4) that the deportation  of  a
    foreign criminal was conducive to it? No doubt they  did  so  primarily
    because of the strength  of  their  wish  to  protect  themselves  from
    disorder and crime, which, of course, is an aim specifically recognised
    in paragraph 2 of article 8 of the ECHR and which the Strasbourg  court
    "has consistently considered [to be]  the  legitimate  aim  pursued  by
    deportation": para 53 of the AA case, cited at  para  25  above.  "This
    means", says Lord Kerr at para 96 below, "that, customarily,  the  risk
    of re-offending will be of predominant importance".  Indeed  Lord  Kerr
    proceeds to ask: "If an individual is unlikely to commit  crime  or  be
    involved in disorder, how can his expulsion on that ground be  said  to
    be rationally connected to the stated aim?" But,  with  respect,  might
    Lord Kerr's analysis be too narrow? Might not the deterrent effect upon
    all foreign citizens (irrespective of whether  they  have  a  right  to
    reside in the UK) of understanding that a serious offence will normally
    precipitate their deportation be a more powerful aid to the  prevention
    of crime than the removal from the UK of one foreign criminal judged as
    likely to re-offend? See DS (India) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2009] EWCA Civ 544; [2010] Imm AR 81, para 37, Rix LJ.

12. Mr McVeety said that it was essentially a matter for the Upper Tribunal
    to determine whether  the  threshold  of  "undue  harshness"  had  been
    crossed in this instance.

13. I consider this to be an unusual case.  I am left in no doubt at all of
    the importance of the public interest in the removal of  criminals  who
    have committed serious offences such as the sexual offence committed by
    this appellant.  However, I make the following findings.  Having regard
    to the medical evidence (in particular  the  reports  of  Dr  Patel)  I
    accept that there would be a "massive impact" upon Z in  particular  of
    the deportation of the appellant.  I accept that the appellant  is  the
    primary carer of Z and  that  Z  has  complex  medical,  emotional  and
    educational needs.  I find that Z is prone to aggressive and physically
    violent responses to disruptions of routine which is vitally  important
    for his continued welfare.  I find that LM  deals  primarily  with  the
    child K but her own physical problems and lack of the physical  ability
    to deal with the outbursts of Z,  together  with  the  complex  medical
    needs of K indicate that she cannot care for both  children  adequately
    on her own.

14. Miss Frantzis, for the appellant, characterises this as  a  case  which
    stood out from the norm primarily on account of the autistic  condition
    of the two minor children.  I agree.  I do, however, attach less weight
    to her submission that the appellant had only spent thirteen months  in
    the last twelve years in the United Kingdom in prison; whilst that  may
    be the case, his offending remains  serious  and,  notwithstanding  his
    apparent  reformation,  the  deterrent  effect   of   the   appellant's
    deportation remains a powerful factor.  Having said that, I  also  note
    that the appellant is no longer on the Sex Offenders Register.

15. Having heard the evidence of both LM and the appellant, I was struck by
    the strength of their relationship as husband  and  wife.   I  have  no
    doubt that they are dedicated to the care of  two  children  whose  own
    lives are rendered  difficult  by  autism.   Having  assessed  all  the
    evidence very carefully and stressing again the relevance of the public
    interest in this instance, I have concluded that this is  a  rare  case
    where the impact of the appellant's removal upon those  family  members
    left behind,  including  his  wife  LM  and  the  children  K  and,  in
    particular Z would have not only unduly harsh consequences but would be
    potentially catastrophic for this family.  In light  in  particular  of
    the fact that LM is, in my finding, unable to cope with Z physically or
    emotionally I consider it inevitable that the removal of the  appellant
    from the family unit would have the consequence of leading  also  to  Z
    requiring the care of third parties,  most  likely  the  care  services
    provided by the local Authority.  That alone  is,  in  my  opinion,  an
    unduly  harsh  consequence  of  the  appellant's  removal.   For  these
    reasons, the appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

16. The appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dated 9 February 2014 is dismissed.
