Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms A Bhachu, Counsel, instructed by City Law
Practice Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The appellants, nationals of Pakistan,  have  permission  to  challenge
    the decision of Judges O'Brien and Meichen of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    sent on 1 May 2019 dismissing their appeal against the decision made by
    the respondent on 24 August 2015 refusing them leave to remain.

2.   The second and the third appellants are the first appellant's  children
    born in July 2014 and December 2015.

3.   The appellants' grounds are three-pronged, the first alleging that  the
    judges erred in going behind a concession made by the  respondent  that
    the first appellant's partner, NB, had an "active role" in the life  of
    her child Z born in February  2013;  the  second  contending  that  the
    judges acted in a procedurally unfair manner by failing to put  to  the
    first appellant  their  apparent  concerns  as  to  whether  the  first
    appellant's partner had in fact played an active role  in  her  child's
    life since Z went to live with their father  in  Scotland  in  November
    2016; the third submitting that the judges erred in failing  "to  carry
    out a child's best interests [of the child] test and proper  assessment
    as to a family split".

4.   I am grateful to both representatives for their careful submissions.

The issue of the concession

5.   Both the appellants' first and second grounds relate to  the  issue  of
    the concession.

6.   The first ground focuses on the accepted fact that  the  respondent  in
    the refusal letter stated  that  the  first  appellant's  partner,  NB,
    played an "active role  in  [the  child  Z's]  life,  as  evidenced  by
    train/coach tickets and letters from [Z's father]".

7.   The panel noted at paragraph  44  that  Z  had  lived  with  the  first
    appellant and Ms NB until November 2016, since when she had lived  with
    her father in Falkirk.  They noted that they had been told that Z  went
    to live with  her  father  because  Ms  NB  had  a  number  of  medical
    conditions and for financial reasons.  The panel noted further that  Ms
    NB had limited leave on the basis of her  relationship  with  Z.   That
    leave had been granted until February 2016 but was  extended  until  21
    December 2018 and she had made an  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain prior to that date.  The  panel  then  went  on  to  assess  Z's
    circumstances as follows:

         "46. The witnesses said that Z's father brings her to visit them on
             weekends by car.  He drops Z off in (sic) the way to visit his
             brother in London.  They set off on Friday afternoon at around
             6pm and arrive at 2-3am on Saturday.  He then picks  up  Z  up
             (sic) on Sunday  morning  to  take  her  back.   However,  the
             witnesses were inconsistent about when Z last  came  and  when
             she is next visiting.  Ms [NB] even  contradicted  herself  in
             that regard.  They were also inconsistent about the  frequency
             of the weekend visits outside school holidays.


         47.  We were not persuaded on balance that Z ever visits Birmingham
             outside school holidays.  Even in school holidays, it does not
             appear that Z has ever visited for longer than a week or  two.
             Ms [NB] claimed that Z was due  to  visit  during  the  Easter
             holidays; however, the First Appellant was unaware of any such
             plans and we were not  satisfied  that  Z  would  in  fact  be
             visiting any time soon.


         48.  Ms [NB] claimed to have last  visited  Z  in  September  2018;
             however, the  only  evidence  in  the  Appellants'  bundle  of
             tickets between Birmingham and Scotland are: an  adult  single
             train ticket to Glasgow on 3 November 2016;  an  adult  single
             train ticket back  on  16  November  2016;  two  standard  bus
             tickets to Glasgow on 2  April  2017;  and  two  standard  bus
             tickets back on 6 April 2017.  The Appellants' bundle was sent
             to the Tribunal on 4 April 2019 and  contains  many  documents
             post-dating Ms [NB's] last claimed visit to see  Z.   On  each
             occasion, Ms [NB] claimed that she took a taxi between Glasgow
             and Falkirk, on each occasion consisting of ï¿½60 and  paid  for
             by friends she had in the area.   However,  no  taxi  receipts
             were provided nor any evidence from the friends who  gave  her
             the money.  All in all, we were not satisfied that Ms [NB] has
             visited  Scotland  since  April  2017,  and  even   then   are
             unpersuaded that she spent all of her  time  with  Z,  instead
             finding that she spent at least some of her time with friends.


         49.  All in all, notwithstanding the Respondent's concession in the
             refusal letter that Ms [NB] played an active role in Z's life,
             we find that their face-to-face contact is minimal.   Instead,
             most, if not all, contact between Z, her half-siblings and  Ms
             [NB] takes place  via  Whatsapp  and  other  modern  means  of
             communication.


         50.  We doubt that the First Appellant has much at all to  do  with
             z.  He knew very little of her visits to Birmingham, which  Ms
             [NB] explained on the basis that Z was her child.   Certainly,
             we reject any  suggestion  that  the  First  Appellant  has  a
             parental relationship with Z."

8.   From the above, at least two things are clear.  First,  the  panel  was
    not simply considering the state of the evidence since the date of  the
    respondent's decision (24 August 2018)  but  was  also  revisiting  the
    nature of Ms Bibi's involvement with Z since April 2017  -   indeed  by
    implication since  Z  moved  to  Scotland  in  November  2016  (see  in
    particular the last sentence of paragraph 48 and the first of paragraph
    51).  Second, the panel was not simply seeking  to  particularise  what
    type of active role Ms NB played in Z's life, but  was  assessing  that
    she did not play such a role.  If the wording of paragraph 49 left this
    issue slightly ambiguous, the panel  made  its  position  unequivocally
    clear in paragraph 51: "[w]e find that this family is already split and
    has been since November 2016".  One way or another therefore, the panel
    did not consider that Ms Bibi's role in Z's life was an active one.

9.   Hence the panel's findings did involve a negation of  the  respondent's
    concession.  The question is therefore whether the panel's approach  to
    this issue was procedurally fair.  Mr Mills' position is that the panel
    acted fairly in that the issue of the nature of  Ms  NB's  relationship
    with Z was raised by the Home Office Presenting Officer  and  both  the
    appellant and Ms NB were cross-examined regarding it.  The  appellants'
    representatives  could  not  claim  to  have  been  deprived   of   the
    opportunity to address the issue.  Ms Bhachu's  position  is  that  the
    effect of the panel's assessment was  to  go  behind  the  respondent's
    concession and this was not made clear to  the  parties  at  the  time.
    When the respondent had made the concession in August 2018,  they  were
    already aware that the family was geographically split  and  had  taken
    that into account.  The  respondent  had  extended  Ms  NB's  leave  to
    December 2018 in full knowledge of the geographical separation.

10.  I am persuaded  that  the  panel's  treatment  of  the  concession  was
    flawed.  Having themselves explicitly identified it as  a  "concession"
    in paragraph 49, they were required to  ensure  that  any  decision  on
    their part to revisit it was made known to the parties.  In  this  case
    (i) the respondent did not seek to withdraw the  concession;  and  (ii)
    the appellant's representative (Ms Bhachu being  involved  at  the  FtT
    hearing also) specifically sought to rely on it: see paragraph 18.   In
    those  circumstances,  the  panel  should  not  have  gone  behind  the
    concession without alerting the  parties  that  they  were  considering
    doing so.  Mr Mills is right that the issue  of  Ms  NB's  relationship
    with Z was the subject of cross-examination, including as to its nature
    and extent pre-August 2018.  But that does  not  mean  that  the  first
    appellant was alerted to the fact that the panel was in fact not minded
    to accept that Ms NB's had had an active role in Z's life up to  August
    2018.  Had the appellants' representatives been aware  that  the  panel
    was going to revisit the  nature  of  Ms  NB's  role  over  the  period
    November 2016-August 2018, they may well have sought to obtain  further
    evidence about the nature and extent of the contact between Ms NB and Z
    during that period.  It is possible Z's father could have  been  called
    as a witness.  The first appellant and Ms NB should have been given  an
    opportunity to produce further evidence.  From paragraph  46  it  would
    appear that the inconsistencies in the evidence of the first  appellant
    and Ms NB regarding when Z last visited  were  about  the  very  recent
    past, not the period November 2016-August  2018,  yet  the  panel  made
    adverse findings on both periods.  It is also unclear whether they were
    afforded an opportunity to  explain  the  contradiction  said  to  have
    arisen in their evidence. The appellants'  grounds do not  cite  higher
    court authority on concessions, but the Upper  Tribunal  decision  they
    cite, Kalidas (agreed facts - best practice) [2012] UKUT  00327  (IAC),
    properly reflects in my judgement the established position that  whilst
    it is within a Tribunal's remit to go behind concessions as  to  facts,
    this is to be regarded as an exceptional step and  judges  must  ensure
    that if there is any withdrawal of a concession  on  the  part  of  the
    respondent, that is made unambiguously clear to  the  other  side:  see
    further Rauf [2019] EWCA Civ 1276.   In  this  case,  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, although having cross-examined the witnesses  about
    the entire history of Ms NB's relationship  with  Z,  said  nothing  in
    submissions to indicate that the  concession  was  to  be  regarded  as
    withdrawn.

11.  The appellants' third ground avers that the panel failed to  carry  out
    a lawful best interests of the  child  assessment.   In  my  judgement,
    there is an integral connection between the  judges'  approach  to  the
    best interests of the child, Z, and their decision  to  go  behind  the
    concession.  At paragraph 51 the panel stated:

         "It is suggested that removing the Appellants  would  result  in  a
         family split.  We find that this family is already  split  and  has
         been since November 2016.   Since  then,  there  has  been  minimal
         direct contact between  Z  and  her  Birmingham-based  family.   We
         accept that Ms [NB] could not come and go between Pakistan and  the
         United Kingdom whilst her leave continues pursuant to s3C.  If  she
         left, her leave would cease and her application would be treated as
         withdrawn.  However, Z could visit  her  in  Pakistan;  indeed,  it
         would appear that Z has previously been taken to  Pakistan  by  her
         father for a family occasion.  We reject any suggestion that any of
         the children's best interest would thereby be prejudiced."

12.  If indeed the nature and extent of Ms NB's involvement with  Z  was  in
    fact minimal - and she had not in fact  played  an  active  role  since
    November 2016 - then the panel's assessment could not be  faulted.   It
    would have been wholly within the range  of  reasonable  responses  for
    them to take the view that Ms NB's ties with Z could be maintained by Z
    visiting Pakistan.  Given, however, that this  factual  assessment  was
    arrived at by a procedurally unfair route, I cannot exclude that  there
    was also legal error in the best interests of the child assessment.  In
    this regard, there is  not  just  the  fact  that  the  respondent  had
    conceded that Ms Bibi had an active role in Z's life some twenty months
    after Z moved to  Scotland,  but  the  fact  that  the  respondent  had
    extended Ms NB's leave to remain on the basis of her relationship  with
    Z even after had moved  to  Scotland  (that  was  the  panel's  express
    understanding of the terms of the grant as set out  at  paragraph  45).
    It is a reasonable inference  that  that  decision  by  the  respondent
    incorporated the view that it was in Z's best  interests  to  have  her
    mother present in the UK  and  able  to  maintain  meaningful  parental
    contact between cities.  The respondent's past grants of leave to Ms NB
    are not of course determinative of the issue of whether the  respondent
    was entitled to refuse leave to the first appellant and their two other
    children, but the fact of the matter is that Ms NB  continues  to  have
    (shared) parental responsibility for Z, which needed to be  weighed  in
    the balance in the proportionality assessment.

13.  For the above reasons I conclude that the  panel  materially  erred  in
    law and their decision must be set aside.

14.  I see no alternative to the case being remitted to the FtT.

DIRECTIONS

15.  To assist the task of the next judge or panel, I hereby direct that:

         the  respondent  submit  to  the  Tribunal,  with  a  copy  to  the
         appellants' representatives, an addendum clarifying whether or  not
         he wishes to maintain or withdraw the  concerns  expressed  in  the
         refusal decision regarding Ms Bibi's active role in the  child  Z's
         life;


         if the respondent does indeed move to withdraw the concession,  the
         appellants' representatives should consider calling Z's father as a
         witness;


         the case be set down for a CMR before the FtT in Birmingham  within
         4 weeks of this decision being sent.

16.  I also record that I received  a  rule  15(2A)  notice  which  included
    under the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 a Home  Office
    letter of 2 July 2019 confirming that Ms NB has been granted  a  period
    of 30 months limited leave on the ten year parent route under paragraph
    D-LTRPT.1.2. of Appendix FM.

17.  To summarise:

     The decision of the FtT is set aside for material error of law.

         The case is remitted to the FtT  (not  before  Judges  O'Brien  and
         Meichen).



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  second  and
third appellants are granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings
