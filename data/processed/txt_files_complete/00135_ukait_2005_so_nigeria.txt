                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The purpose of Article 8 is not to preserve the benefits felt by third
parties attributable to the appellant's presence in the United Kingdom but
to protect the appellant's own private and family life

  1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on  4  April  1970.
     He is 35 years old.  He entered the United Kingdom on 26 March 1998 as
     a visitor with the purpose of attending his sister who was  terminally
     ill.  An extension of leave was granted for a further 12 months.   His
     sister died on 4 August 2000.  During the subsistence  of  his  leave,
     the appellant married on 6 November 1999.  He was  granted  12  months
     leave to remain on the basis of his marriage to a person  present  and
     settled in the United Kingdom.  That leave expired on 8 November 2001.
      Had his marriage subsisted, he would have been entitled to apply  for
     leave to remain indefinitely.  Unfortunately, the marriage broke  down
     in August 2001 and prevented his applying for further leave to  remain
     on the basis of his marriage.
  2. On the day before his leave to remain expired on 8 November 2001,  the
     appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain.   Solicitors  acting
     on his behalf alleged that his application  should  be  considered  in
     accordance  with  the  policy  concerning  the  victims  of   domestic
     violence.  Notwithstanding a request for information  and  documentary
     evidence,  no  suitable  material  was   provided   to   satisfy   the
     requirements of the Immigration Rules.  It is clear that the appellant
     never satisfied the requirements of the Rules and his application was,
     accordingly, bound to fail.  The appellant had not informed the police
     of his situation.  The police have not issued a  caution  against  his
     wife.  He  did  not  obtain  an  injunction  against  her  or  a  non-
     molestation order or any other protection order.   His  wife  has  not
     been convicted before a court of any relevant offence.   Nevertheless,
     the making of that application provided the appellant with  the  right
     not to be removed whilst it was  being  considered.   Mr  Jibowu,  who
     appeared on behalf of the appellant, sought  to  equate  that  with  a
     right to remain granted by the Secretary of State.  We do  not  accept
     that submission.  In the course of argument, we referred to his status
     as "the status of irremovability".  Since, however,  that  status  was
     based upon an application for leave to remain which was bound to fail,
     and did in fact fail, it was a fragile basis upon which to build up  a
     private or family life.  The appellant has been in the United  Kingdom
     for somewhat less than four years since his leave to remain expired on
     8 November 2001.
  3. By decision made on 18 October 2002, the Secretary  of  State  refused
     his application for indefinite leave to remain.  He took the view that
     the  application  was  sought  for  a  purpose  not  covered  by   the
     Immigration  Rules  and  was  therefore  bound  to  be  refused  under
     paragraph 322 (i) of the Immigration Rules.  Further, the Secretary of
     State considered whether the appellant's application on the  basis  of
     his being a victim of domestic violence should be  considered  outside
     the rules.  Given the absence  of  documentary  evidence  required  in
     support of it, the Secretary of State refused that  application.   The
     exercise of a  discretion  by  the  Secretary  of  State  outside  the
     Immigration Rules is not subject to a review by an Adjudicator  as  to
     its merits.  See paragraph 21 of Schedule 4  to  the  Immigration  and
     Asylum Act 1999.
  4. The appellant appealed to an Adjudicator, Mrs F. M.  Kempton,  on  the
     basis that  his  removal  would  violate  his  human  rights  and,  in
     particular, his rights to private and family life enshrined in Article
     8 of the ECHR.  This aspect was considered by the Secretary  of  State
     who did not consider a violation would occur and concluded that  there
     were no insurmountable obstacles preventing the appellant returning to
     Nigeria and continuing his private life there.  He maintained that the
     appellant's removal  would  be  a  proportionate  response  given  the
     history that we have related and that his was not an exceptional or  a
     truly exceptional case.
  5. The Adjudicator allowed the appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds.
  6.  The  Secretary  of  State  appealed  against  the  decision  of   the
     Adjudicator.   That  appeal   now   falls   to   be   treated   as   a
     reconsideration.
  7. The appellant had argued before the Adjudicator that the Secretary  of
     State had failed to give sufficient weight to representations made  on
     behalf of the appellant under the policy relating to  the  victims  of
     domestic violence.  It was argued that a conviction or injunction were
     not necessary prerequisites in  establishing  domestic  violence.   It
     has, however, to be said that there is a distinct  difference  between
     an allegation of violence made by a spouse and a finding of fact  made
     by a relevant domestic court that such violence has occurred  or  that
     the appellant has taken the  steps  of  seeking  protection  from  the
     police or the courts.  We consider that the requirements of the  Rules
     are clear and that there  is  no  need  to  dilute  the  sensible  and
     proportionate mechanisms within the Rules in order to comply with  the
     ECHR.  The application of the Rules must, of course, be  conducted  in
     accordance with the appellant's Convention rights - see Rule 2.
  8. More importantly for our purposes, the appellant also  claimed  before
     the Adjudicator that, since arriving in the United Kingdom, he had set
     up his  own  company.   In  paragraph  2  of  the  determination,  the
     Adjudicator refers to a Company with two employees  but  it  is  clear
     from paragraph 11 of the determination that the  appellant  employs  a
     larger number of staff, some 16.  In addition, he is a member  of  the
     Friday International Christian Centre Church presided over  by  Pastor
     Friday who is himself  a  member  of  the  British  Clergy  Leadership
     Mission to the Middle East for  mediation  in  the  Palestinian  Peace
     talks.
  9. The Adjudicator recorded the appellant's work record.   He  started  a
     valet company providing  a  valet  service  to  nightclubs;  including
     cleaning, a cloakroom service and a  back  bar  service.   His  annual
     turnover stood at ï¿½84,000 for the year preceding the hearing.   Pastor
     Friday gave evidence in relation to the efforts made by the  appellant
     in the local community and the significant help he has provided there.
      He offers pastoral help to drug addicts and  drunks.   Pastor  Friday
     did not consider he could carry out such activities for  a  church  in
     Nigeria "as he would have to find a deliverance ministry like his  own
     one in the United Kingdom".  That said, it is of course conceded  that
     Nigeria has a huge Christian church and  that,  regrettably,  pastoral
     help for drug addicts and alcoholics is required there as much  as  in
     the United Kingdom.
 10. Mr Jibowu submitted to the Adjudicator, as he did before us, that  the
     Immigration  Rules  should  be  applied  in  a  sensible  manner.   In
     paragraph  16  of  the  determination  the  Adjudicator  recorded  the
     submission in these terms:
           "A case has been made for domestic violence.  There is no  doubt
           that the appellant has established a private life in the  United
           Kingdom and indeed all his working life has been in  the  United
           Kingdom.  It would be very disproportionate  to  the  legitimate
           aim to send the appellant back to Nigeria.   Such  treatment  is
           for people who bend the rules.  The rules are  not  intended  to
           punish  those  who  have  entered  the  country  properly.   The
           appellant provides employment for 16 persons.  Removal would  be
           disproportionate to the legitimate aim.  It  is  an  exceptional
           case."
 11. The Adjudicator accepted that submission.   In  paragraph  19  of  the
     determination,  the  Adjudicator  stated  that   the   appellant   had
     established a private life in the United Kingdom during  the  time  he
     has been a legitimate resident of the United Kingdom.   Whilst  it  is
     true that, during the pendency  of  his  application,  the  subsequent
     appeal and the later appeal to the Tribunal, he has had the right  not
     to be removed, that does not, in our  judgment,  amount  to  a  status
     greater than a right not to be removed.  If the application was  bound
     to fail, it can hardly count as a persuasive factor.  Given  that  his
     right to remain determined in November 2001 as a result of the failure
     of his  marriage  some  few  months  before,  he  has  never  had  any
     substantive right to remain and his presence is  attributable  to  his
     pursuing a right to remain under the Rules which was  bound  to  fail.
     His Article 8 claim was and remains largely fuelled  by  his  extended
     presence in the United Kingdom whilst the legal process  continued  to
     establish that fact.  Accordingly, the Adjudicator's reliance upon his
     lawful presence in United Kingdom  for  a  period  of  over  6ï¿½  years
     appears to us to be misplaced and amounts to an error of law.
 12. The Adjudicator then went on to consider the fact that  the  appellant
     employs 16 people and that he also acts as an assistant Pastor in  the
     Reverend  Friday's  church.   She  said  in  paragraph   20   of   her
     determination:

           "I do not know  what  would  happen  to  his  business,  as  the
           appellant is the sole director and owner of the business.  I  do
           not know if the business could be  easily  sold  with  a  smooth
           transition, involving a complete  transfer  of  the  undertaking
           with all 16 employees having their jobs guaranteed.  It  may  be
           in those circumstances that a purchaser  of  the  company  would
           make a number of persons redundant.  There would be in any event
           a large element of upset  and  disruption  for  the  appellant's
           employees if he were to be required to return to Nigeria.   That
           would be a matter outwith the hands of  the  appellant  and  the
           employees.  Would  such  a  scenario  be  proportionate  to  the
           legitimate aim of immigration control?  I  doubt  that,  as  the
           appellant is a taxpayer who provides work for 16 people.   I  do
           not see how the possibility of unemployment for 16 people  could
           be justified if that were  the  result  of  insisting  upon  the
           appellant's removal from the UK.  It seems to  me  that  such  a
           step would be Draconian, a sledgehammer to crack a  nut,  simply
           to make a point that no one can be exempt from  the  immigration
           rules."
 13. In our judgment, that reasoning amounts to an error of law.  First, it
     was for the appellant to  establish  by  credible  evidence  what,  on
     balance of probabilities, the consequences would be  of  his  removal.
     The appellant's employees are performing work of the nature  described
     by the appellant.  The appellant provided no evidence that  this  work
     would not remain available for them to do if he departed.  As  far  as
     we are aware, no documentary evidence was provided as to the terms  of
     employment.  In our  judgment,  it  was  wholly  speculative  for  the
     Adjudicator to rely upon the possibility  that  a  number  of  persons
     would be made redundant.  If the business is a  viable  one,  it  must
     have a market value.  We see no reason why it cannot be disposed of as
     a going concern, albeit a purchaser may  be  in  a  strong  bargaining
     position given the inability of the  appellant  to  remain  in  United
     Kingdom.  If it is a going concern, the Adjudicator did not  give  any
     consideration to whether the business could continue to run whilst the
     appellant  was  out  of  the  country.    Whilst   we   accept   these
     considerations are speculative, we are satisfied that it was  for  the
     appellant to establish the consequences of his removal and he did  not
     do so.  Second, even if the appellant's removal would  result  in  the
     loss of 16 jobs and the possibility of redundancy,  in  our  judgment,
     that attracts little weight in an Article 8 claim, if any at all.  The
     purpose of Article 8 is to protect the private and family life of  the
     appellant.  It is outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Adjudicator  to
     consider the overall economic welfare of the country and the  need  to
     maintain  employment.    These   are   matters   wholly   outside   an
     Adjudicator's expertise and lie squarely within the discretion of  the
     Secretary of State, acting on behalf of  the  community  as  a  whole.
     Thirdly, the correct approach  by  the  Adjudicator  was  to  consider
     whether, given the appellant's obvious ability and, in particular, his
     entrepreneurial skills, he could not  use  those  skills  in  Nigeria.
     Whilst, doubtless, economic opportunities in  Nigeria  are  different,
     there was no material before the Adjudicator to suggest the  appellant
     could not  find  work  or  start  his  own  business  on  return.   In
     particular, a "valet company providing a valet service to  nightclubs;
     including cleaning, a cloakroom service and a  back  bar  service"  is
     work of the type that is available in Nigeria as well as in the United
     Kingdom.  There will inevitably be substantial differences but  it  is
     not the purpose of Article 8 to guarantee to an appellant  a  type  of
     work or a style of work that he finds particularly congenial.  Indeed,
     it is difficult to see how Article 8 can be used in order to protect a
     right to work at all, given the high rates of unemployment that  exist
     in many countries and which, at present, do not exist  in  the  United
     Kingdom.  Fourth, the  appellant  failed  to  take  into  account  the
     principles laid down in Tribunal decisions that focus upon the correct
     approach in such cases.
 14. Miss Leatherland, who appeared on behalf that the Secretary of  State,
     relied upon D (Croatia) [2004] UKIAT 00051, (Ouseley  J.,  President),
     in which the Tribunal considered the case of an appellant  who  worked
     as the manager of an hotel earning a salary which she and her  husband
     needed in order to maintain the mortgage on the house.   At  the  same
     time she assisted in the childcare arrangements  necessary  that  both
     might  work.   Notwithstanding  the  significant  disruption  to   the
     appellant's  family  life,  the  Tribunal  concluded   that   it   was
     proportionate, particularly  since  the  development  of  private  and
     family life occurred during a  period  when  the  precarious,  perhaps
     tenuous, right to remain was known to the appellant.  Miss Leatherland
     also relied upon the  decision  in  MG  (Assessing  interference  with
     private life) Serbia and Montenegro [2005]  UKAIT  00113,  (Mr  P.  R.
     Lane, presiding).   The decision involved a consideration of the  role
     of  "good  works"  in  Article  8  cases.   In  paragraph  27  of  its
     determination, the Tribunal said:

           "This Tribunal has to say that it has great difficulty with  the
           suggestion that  a  person  can,  by  choosing  to  undertake  a
           particular course of study, leading to employment in a job  that
           an Adjudicator regards as socially worthwhile, achieve a greater
           "moral and physical integrity" than a person who,  for  whatever
           reason, does neither of these things.  The  European  Convention
           and the domestic legislation that underpins it  are  not  to  be
           used by Tribunals as a means of recognising and  rewarding  what
           is  considered  to  be  industrious  conduct  on  the  part   of
           individual.  Very many of  those  who  appeal  on  human  rights
           grounds against an immigration decision  have  been  working  or
           studying in some capacity in the United  Kingdom.   Very  often,
           those persons originated in countries in which they  experienced
           hardship of various kinds, albeit not amounting  to  persecution
           or inhuman  or  degrading  treatment.   Such  persons,  however,
           routinely  fail  to  show  that  their  removal   would   be   a
           disproportionate interference with their Article 8 rights."
 15. It is both artificial and unjust to make qualitative  decisions  about
     the nature of work undertaken in the  United  Kingdom.   There  is  no
     place for a carefully constructed scale of merit so that nurses in the
     NHS are viewed more favourably than a typist  in  a  private  company,
     although a typist working for the NHS or  for  Social  Services  might
     fare somewhat better than his colleague in industry.  As the  Tribunal
     made clear in MG, the purpose of Article 8 is not to reward virtue; we
     would add, neither is it to punish the  Secretary  of  State  for  his
     dilatoriness in processing an application.
 16. For these reasons, we consider  that  the  Adjudicator  was  wrong  in
     placing so much emphasis upon the fact that the appellant had  started
     a business which employed, so we assume, United Kingdom nationals  who
     paid their taxes and National Insurance contributions.
 17. The appellant also relied upon his work in  the  Friday  International
     Christian Centre, described by  the  Revd.  Friday  as  a  deliverance
     ministry.  We are satisfied that the  appellant  has  performed  truly
     worthwhile work in the local community assisting those in need in  the
     exercise of his Christian faith.  No doubt, the type  of  church  with
     which the appellant will be associated in Nigeria will be somewhat, or
     perhaps substantially, different.  Nevertheless, the practice  of  his
     Christian faith and the outward demonstration of that faith in helping
     the poor and the needy will be available to him in Nigeria as it is in
     the United Kingdom.  The Adjudicator appeared to focus upon  the  loss
     that would be suffered in the United Kingdom by those who benefit from
     the appellant's ministry.  In our judgment, she disregarded the  equal
     benefits that this appellant will be  able  to  provide  to  those  in
     Nigeria.  Once again, we  consider  the  Adjudicator's  focus  was  on
     preserving the benefits presently provided by  the  appellant  in  the
     United Kingdom to his fellows.  The purpose of Article 8 is,  however,
     to protect the appellant's own private and family life and, for  those
     purposes, it is immaterial whether the recipients  of  his  activities
     are in  Nigeria  or  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Accordingly,  we  are
     satisfied that the appellant will be able both to  work  and  practice
     his faith in Nigeria in ways that will not compromise  his  family  or
     private life.  Accordingly, the Adjudicator reached an error of law in
     concluding that his removal would violate his private life.
 18. This effectively disposes of the appeal.  We are  satisfied  that  the
     response of the Secretary  of  State  is  a  proportionate  one.   The
     appellant has no right to enter or remain in the United Kingdom  under
     the Immigration Rules, far less the Refugee  Convention.   We  do  not
     consider that his activities since arrival, (or his  activities  since
     November 2001  when  his  leave  to  remain  expired),  establish  any
     prospect of a violation of his rights  were  he  to  be  removed.   We
     accept that he has made good use of  his  time  and  energies  in  the
     United Kingdom but the majority of those energies have  been  expended
     during a period when he had no substantive right to remain.
