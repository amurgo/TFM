Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms T Star, of counsel, instructed by VMD Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 3 February,  1982.  He
      was granted leave to enter the United  Kingdom  on  17  January,  2009
      until 31 May, 2012.

   2. The appellant applied on 31 May, 2012 for leave to remain as a Tier  4
      student at the London Academy of Learning. When the respondent came to
      consider the matter it was found that the London Academy  of  Learning
      was not listed and accordingly  the  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
      Studies (CAS) was not valid. The appellant was given 60 days to obtain
      a new sponsor and a new CAS.

   3. On 26 October, 2012 the respondent  refused  the  application  as  the
      appellant's CAS was not valid for the reasons already given.

   4. The appellant appealed and his appeal was dealt with on the papers  by
      a First-tier Judge on 9 January 2013.

   5. The appellant claimed that he had sent  a  new  CAS  from  the  London
      Academy of Management Science and that he had sent it to the Secretary
      of State on 19 October,  2012.  He  produced  a  Royal  Mail  tracking
      document which indicated that an item  had  been  delivered  from  the
      Durham delivery office on 22 October, 2012. The judge  could  not  see
      why the Durham delivery office was involved  since  the  Secretary  of
      State would be in either Sheffield or Croydon. A copy  of  the  letter
      had not been included in the bundle. The judge could not be  satisfied
      that a new CAS had been lodged as claimed.

   6. The judge accordingly dismissed the appeal under the immigration rules
      but held that the decision to remove the appellant under section 47 of
      the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 was unlawful
      following  Ahmadi (s. 47 decision: validity; Sapkota) [2012] UKUT
      00147 (IAC) (see now Ahmadi v Secretary of State   [2013] EWCA Civ
      512).

   7. Permission to appeal was sought and Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley
      granted permission commenting that if the Home Office address was
      indeed in Durham the judge might have made a mistake of fact leading
      to an error of law.

   8. At the hearing before me Ms Holmes indicated she wished to check on
      the validity of a letter in the appellant's bundle from the Home
      Office on 23 October, 2012. This was a document that had not been
      placed before the First-tier Judge acknowledging the appellant's
      application. A letter dated 19 October, 2012 from the representatives
      to the Home Office was also included. On 20 February, 2013 this
      application was returned on the basis of the outstanding appeal.

   9. The hearing was put back and when it resumed Ms Holmes confirmed  that
      the letter in the appellant's bundle was a genuine document.

  10. Counsel submitted that in the circumstances it was accepted  that  the
      appellant's revised application had been submitted in time.

  11. It was accordingly agreed that the matter should be  returned  to  the
      Home Office on both the issue under section 47  and  on  the  decision
      under the immigration rules.

  12. Counsel commented that a simple Internet search  "UKBA  Durham"  might
      have allayed the concerns of the First-tier Judge although in fairness
      the appellant's case could have  been  put  more  clearly  before  the
      judge.

  13. Counsel submitted the appellant should receive a fee award.

  14. By agreement the appeal is allowed to the extent that the matter is to
      be reconsidered by the Home Office on the basis that the appellant did
      return the new CAS within the required deadline. Appeal  also  allowed
      on the section 47 point.

      I remake the decision:

      Appeal allowed as indicated

      Fee Award
      It is appropriate in the premises to make a whole fee award




                               Signed




                               4 June 2013


                                Judge of the Upper Tribunal
