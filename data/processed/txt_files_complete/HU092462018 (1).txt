               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Toofan Naqshbandi, is a male citizen of Afghanistan.  He
    had appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Hodgkinson)  against  a
    decision of the Secretary of State dated 14 September  2017  to  refuse
    his human rights  (Article  8  ECHR)  claim.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissed his appeal. The appellant now appeals,  with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. At the initial hearing on 17 September 2018, Mr Clark, who appeared for
    the Secretary of State, told me that the respondent considered that the
    First-tier Tribunal had erred in law such that its decision fell to  be
    set aside by refusing to grant  an  adjournment  of  the  hearing  (see
    grounds of appeal, paragraphs 6-10).  As a consequence,  the  appellant
    had been denied a fair hearing of his appeal.

 3. In the circumstances, I set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision.

Notice of Decision

 4. The First-tier Tribunal decision which was promulgated on 3  July  2018
    is set aside. None of the findings of fact shall stand. The  appeal  is
    returned to the First-tier Tribunal (not  Judge  Hodgkinson)  for  that
    Tribunal to remake the decision.
