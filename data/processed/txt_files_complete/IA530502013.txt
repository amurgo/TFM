For the Appellant:     Ms S Hoey, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The parties are as described above, but are referred to in the rest  of
    this determination as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. Judge Watters allowed the appeal under Article 8 of the  ECHR,  outwith
    the Immigration Rules, on the basis of strong  family  ties  among  the
    Appellant and the three daughters of his late wife,  who  died  on  5th
    April 2012.

 3. The SSHD's grounds of appeal  are  that  the  judge  did  not  consider
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640 and Shahzad [2014]  UKUT  85,  amounting  to  a
    material error of failure to consider "the case  specific  guidance  on
    departing from the Rules and further considering Article 8".

 4. The Presenting Officer submitted as follows.  At the  crucial  part  of
    the determination, �16, the judge failed to consider the correct  legal
    approach to Article 8.  He did not clearly identify any good reasons or
    compassionate circumstances for going outside the Rules.  She  accepted
    that he did acknowledge "the legitimate need to maintain  an  effective
    national immigration policy".  She pointed out that at the time of  the
    hearing the Appellant was living in London not  in  Edinburgh  and  had
    been living separately from the persons on whom his  claim  was  based.
    He had only ever lived with one of the three stepdaughters.  There  was
    no element of dependency  going  beyond  normal  emotional  ties  among
    adults.  Although the judge found  "strong  family  ties"  he  had  not
    considered the correct legal test.  The  Appellant's  circumstances  at
    the date of the hearing were sad but not unusual, and the judge was not
    entitled  to  find  that  the  decision  led  to  unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences.  Mrs Saddiq accepted that the grounds did not go  so  far
    as to say that the decision was irrational and outwith the scope of any
    judge, but she said that the essence of the grounds was that the appeal
    could properly only have been dismissed, so she asked for the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal to be reversed.

 5. Ms Hoey submitted as follows.  The appellant put his  case  as  one  of
    good grounds for granting leave  outside  the  Rules  by  reference  to
    Article 8, and the whole determination was written on that basis.   The
    point was clear from the phrasing of the final sentence of �16.  Having
    heard and carefully examined the evidence the judge thought  there  was
    good reason for looking outside the Rules.  The conclusion  that  there
    were strong family ties among the Appellant and his three stepdaughters
    was properly open to him.  Although not reflected in the determination,
    there had been submissions on the tests  for  finding  family  life  to
    exist among adults, including reference to Kugathas [2003] INLR 170 and
    to ZB (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 834.  The judge was presumed  to  know
    the law and to apply the correct test, particularly when  he  had  been
    reminded of it in submissions.  He was not required to set out all  the
    applicable law.  All three stepdaughters had given oral evidence in the
    First-tier  Tribunal.   That  included  evidence  of  the   Appellant's
    relationship with three children, considered to be  his  grandchildren.
    The Upper Tribunal should not go behind the assessment reached  by  the
    judge who had heard the oral evidence.  The reasons for  the  Appellant
    leaving Edinburgh had been explained in evidence.  He had support  from
    his brother there.  His moving away made it  easier  for  the  youngest
    stepdaughter, who had previously been part  of  the  household  of  the
    Appellant and his late wife, to find her own accommodation.  A  weighty
    factor was that none of the three stepdaughters had  significant  links
    with their biological father.  There was no error such  as  to  require
    the determination to be set aside.  If it were  to  be  set  aside,  it
    should not simply be reversed.  The evidence should firstly be updated.



 6. At this point, under reservation of the error of  law  issue,  I  heard
    brief evidence from the Sponsor.  He now lives in his own accommodation
    in Edinburgh, close to his three stepdaughters.  He sees all  of  them,
    and the three grandchildren, at least twice a week.   He  is  presently
    legally able to work, but due to his uncertain longer  term  status  he
    has not been able to find permanent employment.  He has had job offers,
    and believes he could find regular work once his status is secure.   He
    presently earns around �250 per week from casual jobs.

 7. Questioned by the Presenting Officer, the Appellant said that he  moved
    back to Edinburgh about six weeks ago.  His long term aim is to live in
    Edinburgh, close to those persons he considers to be his family.

 8. In reply to the submissions for the Appellant, the  Presenting  Officer
    said that if the case did reach the stage of remaking the  decision  by
    reference to the updated evidence, the criteria in ZB and  other  cases
    on family life among adults  suggested  that  the  appropriate  finding
    would be that family life does not exist for Article 8 purposes.

 9. I indicated that the SSHD's appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  would  be
    dismissed.

10. The judge might have referred to the criterion that family life is  not
    generally to be found  among  adult  relatives  unless  something  more
    exists than the normal emotional ties.  However, the SSHD's grounds  do
    not say that the judge was not entitled to reach the finding he did  on
    the existence of strong family ties.  In any event, I consider that the
    judge was entitled  to  make  that  finding,  under  the  circumstances
    mentioned above  and  (in  more  detail)  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination.

11. A judge does not have to quote any case law, so long  as  it  is  clear
    that he  applied  the  correct  guiding  principles.   It  was  obvious
    throughout the hearing that this case turned on  whether  it  could  be
    considered and allowed  outwith  the  Rules.   In  his  concluding  two
    sentences the judge relates  his  conclusions  to  the  tests  of  good
    grounds for granting leave outside the Rules, and of refusal  resulting
    in unjustifiably harsh consequences.  I find  no  error  of  the  judge
    wrongly instructing himself on the law.

12. The judge's findings on the underlying primary facts are not in any way
    erroneous.  He had the benefit of hearing  the  oral  evidence  of  all
    adult family members.  The criticism that  the  ultimate  judgement  he
    reached, based on those facts, was not properly  open  to  him  is  not
    raised by the grounds squarely, if at all.  It aims at showing an error
    of perversity, a high target.





13. The decision in this case might not be one which every judge would have
    reached, and some might think it generous, but I do not think it is one
    which no reasonable judge, having properly instructed  himself  on  the
    law, could have  come  to.   The  grounds  are  not  really  more  than
    disagreement with the  outcome,  dressed  up  under  an  error  of  law
    heading.

14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
