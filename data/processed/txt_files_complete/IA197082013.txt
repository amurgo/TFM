Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Khosla - Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Gareth Earnest Gamble, a citizen of Zimbabwe  born
    24th April 1979.  He appeals against the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    made on 15th May 2013 to refuse further leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom and to remove him by way of directions under Section 47 of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The Appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal was allowed
    under the Immigration Rules (Paragraph  EX1 of Appendix FM)  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Oliver who set out his reasons for that decision in
    a determination issued on 3rd June 2014.  Permission was granted to the
    Respondent to appeal against that  determination  and  on  20th  August
    2014, having heard submissions, I found that there was a material error
    of law in the determination of the First-tier Tribunal and I  set  that
    decision aside with no preserved findings of fact.

 3.  Briefly the facts of this case are that the Appellant entered  the  UK
    as a student with valid leave in 2002  and  subsequently  extended  his
    stay.  In 2006 an application to remain on the basis of his UK ancestry
    was refused but he was  granted  three  years  discretionary  leave  on
    appeal in 2009.  On 13th November 2012 he applied for further leave  to
    remain and it is the refusal of that application that is the subject of
    this appeal.  There had been some delay by the Home Office  in  dealing
    with applications over the years.

 4. The Appellant said in his statements that he has been in a relationship
    in the UK with Layla Salha since around June 2011.  They  undertook  an
    Islamic marriage on 12th July  2012.   They  wanted  to  have  a  civil
    ceremony but could not arrange this as a number of requests to the Home
    Office to return his  passport  were  unsuccessful.  Ms  Salha  is  now
    pregnant with his child.  This is her third pregnancy as she previously
    miscarried twice in 2013.  She is six and a half months  pregnant  now.
    The due date is 31st December 2014 and they are hopeful that everything
    will be fine this time.

 5. The Appellant had been in a previous relationship with Melanie Charlene
    Howes, a British citizen.  The position of the Respondent is  that  the
    grant of discretionary leave which was made to the  Appellant  on  13th
    November 2009 was on the basis of his family life with Ms  Howes.   The
    Appellant's solicitors had advised the Home Office on 6th May 2013 that
    the relationship was no longer subsisting.  In her refusal  letter  the
    Secretary of State said with relation  to  his  Islamic  marriage  with
    Layla Salha that marriages conducted under Islamic law in  the  UK  are
    not considered to be admissible evidence of marriage so Miss  Salha  is
    not accepted as being his wife.  It seems that the Secretary  of  State
    also took the view at that point that the Appellant and Miss Salha  had
    not been in a relationship akin to marriage or civil partnership for at
    least two years

 6. In his initial statement the Appellant said that in  the  determination
    of his first appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  in  July  2009  the
    Judge accepted him as a credible witness.  He and Ms  Salha  wanted  to
    undergo a civil marriage and still seek to get married under UK law but
    when he contacted a number of registrars they all said  he  would  need
    his original passport.  His partner is  self-employed  with  an  annual
    gross income of around �23,000 per annum and he earns �25,000.  He  has
    a maternal aunt and paternal grandmother in the UK  with  whom  he  has
    regular contact.  He has had no ties  with  Zimbabwe  since  1998.   He
    speaks none of the native languages used there.

 7. In the Appellant's supplementary statement provided for the hearing  he
    reiterates that he and his partner have been in  a  relationship  since
    June 2011.  They have been  cohabiting  for  that  period  although  he
    accepts that there is limited documentation to show this.  He is  still
    not a named tenant on the tenancy agreement for the house they live  in
    because the housing association through which  his  partner  rents  the
    property will not do this unless they see his passport.  The bills  are
    all addressed to his partner though he pays them by  bank  transfer  or
    standing order.  Their child will automatically be a  British  citizen.
    The Respondent had made a suggestion that he should go to  New  Zealand
    to live because his parents are there but he has no basis on  which  he
    could live there.  He was only ever there as a visitor.  In  any  event
    he could not expect his partner to move to New Zealand or  Zimbabwe  or
    any other country for that matter as her family and life are here.  She
    has lived here since 1990,  her  family  having  been  granted  refugee
    status.  She came from  Lebanon.   He  suggests  that  it  is  "frankly
    preposterous" to suggest that they should move their lives from the UK.
     With regard to a suggestion that he go to Zimbabwe to apply for  entry
    clearance it would not be reasonable to expect him to go  through  this
    procedure.  He did not feel welcome in Zimbabwe.  He would have nowhere
    to go even for the  short  time  it  would  take  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance.  In any event he needs to be here with his  partner  pending
    the birth of their child.

 8. In oral evidence he adopted his statements.  He confirmed  that  before
    coming to the UK in  1998  he  was  a  student.   He  never  worked  in
    Zimbabwe.

 9. In cross-examination Mr Melvin put it to him  that  when  his  ancestry
    application  was  refused  he  had  submitted  false  documents.    The
    Appellant denied that.  He said the documents he had submitted had come
    from his father and he had no reason to believe that these were  false.
    He confirmed that the last time he had valid leave prior  to  2009  was
    probably  August  2003.   He  confirmed  that  when  he   was   granted
    discretionary leave in 2009 it was on the  basis  of  his  relationship
    with Miss Howes but this relationship broke down in January or February
    2010.  The relationship had lasted about five years.  He was  asked  if
    he had any comment to make on the fact that the relationship had  ended
    shortly after he was granted discretionary leave and said that it was a
    stressful time and his  immigration  issues  led  to  the  relationship
    breaking down.  He was asked whether there was any reason  why  he  did
    not advise the Home Office that the reason for his leave had ceased  to
    exist.  The Appellant responded that he did not see it in that way.  It
    did not occur to him that he had to do anything about the fact that  he
    had split up with his partner.  He had leave and believed that he had a
    right to be here.  There was some discussion at this point  about  what
    was actually in the letter granting discretionary  leave.  The  general
    view was that such letters it do not specify the grounds for the  grant
    but no documentary evidence was produced by either side.

10. The Appellant went on to confirm that he had met  his  current  partner
    Miss Salha in 2010 and they started dating in June 2011.  They  met  at
    the gym at which Miss Salha works.  He did not initially tell her about
    his immigration status in the UK.  Mr Melvin asked him if it  became  a
    factor in their relationship when he realised that his leave was coming
    to an end in November 2012 and he responded that he had told her before
    that.  He was asked about his Islamic marriage and said that he used to
    be a Christian but he converted to Islam  on  his  wedding  day.   They
    married at the mosque in Acton.  This is not his partner's local mosque
    because she is not a practising Muslim.   His  father-in-law  organised
    the wedding as   he speaks Arabic and made all the  arrangements  along
    with his  mother-in-law.   It  was  mainly  his  partner's  family  who
    attended.  His own family live in New Zealand.  There  were  about  ten
    people there and his wife wore a creamy white dress.  He was  asked  if
    there is any reason why Miss Salha's parents did not give a  statement
    in support of the appeal and said  that  they  are  supportive  of  the
    relationship but they just did not do a statement.  His  partner  is  a
    great support to her brother and her parents  appreciate  that.   There
    was a great deal of discussion about why the civil ceremony did not  go
    ahead on the same day and the Appellant said  they  could  not  get  it
    arranged for that   day and in response to the question of why they did
    not get married under UK law later, said that they wanted to do  it  on
    the same day because they did not want two anniversary dates  but  they
    were unable to do it because the Home  Office  has  his  passport.   He
    confirmed that none of the witnesses giving evidence at the hearing had
    attended the Islamic marriage.  His partner had lived in the flat  they
    are living in for ten years before he moved in.  He has not visited his
    parents since 2001.

11. I then heard evidence from Miss Salha who adopted her two statements in
    which she confirms her pregnancy and says she  cannot  imagine  a  life
    anywhere other than in the UK.  She will need the support of her mother
    and her sister when she has her baby.   Her parents and three  siblings
    all live in the UK but her parents are separated.  Her brother  suffers
    from a number of medical conditions and requires care.  He sustained  a
    gunshot wound to his head when he was 5 years old  during  the  war  in
    Lebanon and suffers from epilepsy and  schizophrenia.   She  helps  out
    with his care as much as she can. Her  mother  is  his  primary  carer.
    She has been cohabiting with the Appellant since December 2011 and does
    not want to throw away everything that she has built up here to go  and
    live in Zimbabwe.

12.  In oral evidence she confirmed that she and the Appellant met  at  the
    gym and when asked when, responded that it was about seven  years  ago.
    They have been together for three or four years.  When  she  was  asked
    when they started dating she said April or May 2010.   It  was  pointed
    out to her that the Appellant had said it was June 2011  and  she  said
    that he had moved in with her in December 2011 so the relationship must
    have started in April or May that year.  Mr Melvin told  her  that  the
    Appellant had said that they first met in 2010 which is a far cry  from
    2007.  She said he was a member of the gym and she knew him.  She is  a
    personal trainer and she knew him as a member.  She is  very  bad  with
    dates.  She said in response to the question of when the Appellant told
    her about his immigration status  that  it  was  when  it  was  up  for
    renewal.  She knew nothing about it before that.  He did not  tell  her
    prior to their wedding.  He told her when it was time to apply  for  an
    extension to his visa.  She was asked to confirm that when she  married
    the Appellant in July 2012 she was not aware that his visa would expire
    four months later.  She said that is correct.  Her family did not  know
    either.  The wedding was arranged some time  around  March.   In  their
    culture people do not live together before  marriage  and  her  parents
    were not happy about it.  Mr Melvin asked her  why,  if  they  started
    making plans in March 2012, they did not arrange a civil  wedding  too.
    She said she wanted a decent wedding and did not want to  rush  things.
    She wanted to live with the Appellant first, get to know  him  and  see
    how they got on.  There was some discussion about a civil ceremony  but
    she wanted to do it her way.  She  did  not  refuse  to  have  a  civil
    ceremony, it was just what they agreed.  They paid �100 to an  Imam  to
    conduct the service and deal with the conversion of the Appellant  from
    Christianity to Islam.  She  does  not  know  what  mosque  her  mother
    attends as she does not discuss religion with her parents.  The wedding
    was a practical one - not one  that  was  advertised  to  friends,  and
    afterwards they went to the local coffee shop.  She wore  a  black  and
    white dress.  The family support the marriage.  They were not asked  to
    give statements.  Their intention is to have a civil ceremony  on  12th
    July in a different year.  They did look into the possibility of  doing
    both ceremonies on the same day but she had no money and was  not  sure
    that she wanted to do that.

13. I have a statement from Miss Bettina Shousha, a  British  citizen,  who
    has known the Appellant and his family for over fifteen years.  She was
    his unofficial guardian at the request  of  his  father.   His  parents
    lived in Zimbabwe at that time.  He resided with her in Bath some  time
    in 1999 and thereafter became part of the family.  He  lived  with  her
    family from 2003 to 2006 when he was a student.  She describes  him  as
    "a resilient honourable young man and a credit  to  his  parents".   He
    moved to London and some time in early 2011 told  her  and  her  family
    that he had met a lovely lady, Ms Salha.  She is aware that they  began
    living together around December 2011.  They were  all  very  happy  for
    him.  When she visited him in Ms  Salha's  flat  around  February  2012
    cookbooks that she had given him were in the kitchen.  Her  family  was
    thrilled when they got married.  In oral evidence she said that she had
    problems remembering dates.  The Appellant is in touch  with  her  son.
    They are good friends.  She became aware  of  the  relationship  a  few
    years ago probably around 2012.  She met his partner around that  time.
    She thought that her son discussed the wedding with  the  Appellant  on
    the phone but she was not sure. She had not attended the wedding.

14. I heard evidence from  Mr  Loughrey  who  adopted  his  statement.   He
    confirmed that he had met Miss Salha about ten  years  ago.   He  lives
    about five minutes' drive away from her  house.   He  sees  the  couple
    about twice a week at the gym.  He found out they were getting  married
    just before the wedding but was unable to give any details of the date.
     He understood it to be a family affair and was not surprised  that  he
    was not invited.

15. I heard evidence from Maria Cristina Freeman who adopted her statement.
     She said  that  she  met  the  Appellant  when  he  came  to  her  for
    counselling around 2011 but prior to that she had met him when he  came
    to pick up the Appellant from her counselling.  They moved in  together
    in December 2011 but she had seen them together from  2010.   When  she
    was asked when the relationship started she said that she  believes  it
    to have been 2010.  When it was put to her that the Appellant had  said
    it was June 2011 she said that maybe they formalised  the  relationship
    then.  She said that the wedding was being planned from 2010 to 2011.

16. Mr Melvin provided a skeleton argument. It is submitted that    in  the
    Appellant's previous appeal in 2009 the Judge did  not  deal  with  the
    issue of the alleged false documents.  He reiterates  the  position  of
    the Secretary of State that the Appellant and his partner did not begin
    cohabiting as a couple two years prior to the date  of  application  on
    13th November  2012,  and  thus  the  Appellant  cannot  succeed  under
    Appendix FM.    With regard to Article 8 he relied on Gulshan  (Article
    8 - new rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 and paragraph 15 of R
    (Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 2712.  The Appellant  formed  his  new
    relationship when his immigration status was precarious and there would
    be no unjustifiably harsh  consequences  arising  from  a  decision  to
    refuse to grant further leave as it would be proportionate for  him  to
    make an application for  leave  from  Zimbabwe  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

17. In oral submissions Mr Melvin relied on the reasons for refusal letter.
     He said he would rely  on  paragraphs  117B  of  the  2002  Act.   The
    Appellant can make an application from outside the UK.  In any event he
    gave evidence at the hearing that was not credible.  He  had  submitted
    false documents in his ancestry application and had failed to tell  the
    Home Office that his relationship on the basis of  which  he  had  been
    granted  discretionary  leave  had  come  to  an   end.    There   were
    discrepancies in the evidence  about  the  dates  the  couple  met  and
    started a relationship and also about the date he told his partner that
    he had problems with his immigration status.  He had said that he  told
    her earlier, prior to the marriage, but she said  he  did  not.   Their
    evidence about why they did not have a civil ceremony under UK  law  is
    inconsistent. Mr Melvin   indeed submitted  that  the  couple  had  not
    actually married under Islamic law.  There is  a  certificate  but  the
    claim that �100 was paid to an Imam to marry a Christian to an  Islamic
    lady is incredible.  There is no certificate of  conversion  to  Islam.
    No-one who attended  the  wedding  came  to  give  evidence.   He  then
    submitted that he does not accept that the Appellant is the  father  of
    the Appellant's child.

18. With regard to the evidence of Mr Loughrey he said it is clear that  he
    knows nothing  about  the  couple.    Miss  Shousha  said  she  was  on
    medication and was vague about when the relationship began.  The proper
    course in this case is for the Appellant  to  go  abroad  and  make  an
    application from there in the proper manner.

19. Mr Khosla also provided a skeleton argument which  basically  sets  out
    the applicable law and the evidence including the written  evidence  of
    support from friends.  It is submitted that the  Appellant  would  meet
    the requirements of Appendix FM and that in any event  the  removal  of
    the  Appellant  would  be  disproportionate.   Reliance  is  placed  on
    Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40, the submission being that it would  be
    unreasonable to expect the Appellant to return to Zimbabwe to  make  an
    application for entry clearance.  He would lose his job and this  would
    affect their ability to meet the requirements  of  the  Rules.   It  is
    submitted that the Appellant no longer has any ties to Zimbabwe and  as
    such  he  meets  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  of   the
    Immigration Rules.  He has been absent from  that  country  for  almost
    sixteen years and has no family there.

20. In oral submissions he said  there  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  the
    Appellant ought to have told the Home Office that his relationship with
    his previous partner had ended.  The Islamic marriage  was  simply  for
    convenience and is irrelevant.  He has been  in  a  genuine  cohabiting
    relationship with Ms Salha since December 2011.  He accepted that  they
    do not meet the Rules.  He said it would take two  to  four  months  to
    make  an  application  in  Zimbabwe  and  this   would   be   for   the
    administrative convenience of  the  Home  Office  which  the  court  in
    Chikwamba said was  unreasonable.   He  also  relied  on  paragraph  E-
    LTRP.2.2(b) of the Immigration Rules which apparently allows an out  of
    time  application  saying  that  the  Appellant  could  make  a   fresh
    application.



Findings and Decision

21. I have given very careful consideration to all the evidence  before  me
    in this case.

22. I do have some concerns about the credibility of the Appellant.  It  is
    clear that there was a significant discrepancy between his  account  of
    when he told his partner about his immigration status and when she said
    he told her.  It seems to me clear that he  withheld  this  information
    from her deliberately which does cast some  doubt  on  the  motive  for
    their marriage.  I would not go so far as Mr Melvin  said  and  suggest
    that the marriage did not take place or indeed that the  child  is  not
    the Appellant's.  I do  note  that  he  has  been  attending  antenatal
    classes with his partner.  His name is  on  the  medical  documents  as
    being involved in the pregnancy.  I doubt whether he would go that  far
    if the baby were not his.

23. The Appellant clearly does not meet the requirements of Appendix FM  of
    the Immigration Rules.  They had not been cohabiting for the  requisite
    period at the date of application.  This was accepted by Mr Khosla.

24. Mr Khosla did however rely on 276ADE, which sets out  the  requirements
    for leave to remain in the UK on the basis of private life. At the time
    the decision was made by the Respondent Paragraph 276ADE (vi)  provided
    for an applicant who, at the date of application,

         'is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in  the  UK  for
         less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but has
         no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the country  to
         which he would have to go if required to leave the UK.'

25. Also relevant is the decision Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria
    [2013] UKUT 60 (IAC). This was a decision pertaining to  paragraph  399
    of the Immigration Rules but the Tribunal noted that the  same  wording
    was used in paragraph 276ADE (vi). They said,

         'The natural and ordinary meaning of the word 'ties'  in  paragraph
         399A of the Immigration Rules imports a concept involving something
         more than merely  remote  or  abstract  links  to  the  country  of
         proposed  deportation  or  removal.  It  involves  there  being   a
         connection to life in that  country.  Consideration  of  whether  a
         person has 'no ties' to such  a  country  must  involve  a  rounded
         assessment of all of the relevant circumstances and is  not  to  be
         limited to 'social, cultural and family' circumstances.'

26. Paragraph 276ADE was  amended with effect from 10th July 2014  and  the
    amendment  replaces the words in parenthesis   in  paragraph  18  above
    with,

           'there would be very significant  obstacles  to  the  applicant's
         integration into'.

27. According to Statement of Changes HC532 this change  came  into  effect
    on 28th July 2014 and applies to all applications  to  which  paragraph
    276ADE and Appendix FM apply and to any other ECHR   Article  8  claims
    which are 'decided' on or after  that  date.  I  assume  this  to  mean
    'decided by the Secretary of State' since the wording of section 19  of
    the Immigration Act 2014 is different, being said  to  apply  'where  a
    court or tribunal is required to  determine  whether  a  decision  made
    under the Immigration Acts',   in summary,   breaches a person's  human
    rights. The application in this case was decided on 15th  May  2014  so
    the original version of 276ADE applies.

28. The Appellant came to the UK in 1998 and apart from a very short  visit
    in 1999 has never been back there. He  has  been  here  for  16  years,
    almost half his life. There was a period when he without leave but then
    there was a delay by the Home Office of over 4 years in dealing with an
    application. The Appellant's parents left Zimbabwe  in  2001  with  his
    sister who now lives in Australia. His life in the UK is with  his  new
    partner. The Upper Tribunal in  Ogundimu  said  that  the  question  is
    whether, looking at the evidence in the round a person has a connection
    to that country. I am unable  to  find  that  this  Appellant  has  any
    connection to Zimbabwe. He left there when he was 20. He  never  worked
    there. He came here to study after having done his  A-levels.  He  went
    back a year later only to renew his passport. His family have all  left
    Zimbabwe many years ago. He never formed an independent private life in
    Zimbabwe. He said he regards Zimbabwe as a foreign  country.   He  does
    not fall within any of the categories  excluded  from  the  benefit  of
    276ADE  and  in  all  the  circumstances  I  find  that  he  meets  the
    requirements of that provision.
