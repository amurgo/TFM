DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not deem it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Baldwin promulgated on 15 April 2014 which  dismissed  the
   Appellant's appeal on all grounds.


Background


3. The Appellant was born on 26 January 1984 and is a citizen  of  Pakistan.
   The Appellant came to the United Kingdom on 7 October 2012 with  a  visit
   visa valid until 2 April 2013. On 25 March 2013 the Appellant applied for
   leave to remain on the basis of his relationship  with  his  partner  and
   child.
4.  On  5  July  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the   Appellant's
   application. The refusal letter  considered  the  application  under  the
   provisions of the Rules that govern family life and private  life  namely
   Appendix FM and paragraph 276 ADE.  The  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
   requirements of the partner route because he did not meet  the  mandatory
   immigration status requirements which provide that an applicant cannot be
   in the United Kingdom as a visitor. He also could not benefit  from  EX.1
   as he was in the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor.  He  did  not  meet  the
   relationship requirements for the parent route as he did  not  have  sole
   responsibility for the child and was eligible to apply as a  partner.  He
   also did not meet the mandatory immigration status requirements  for  the
   parental route. Ex.1 did not apply as the Appellant failed  to  meet  the
   eligibility requirements as he was in the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor.
   The Appellant did not meet the private life  requirements  of  the  Rules
   because of the period he had lived in the United Kingdom and there was no
   argument he had lost all ties to Pakistan. No  exceptional  circumstances
   were found to exist to warrant a grant of leave outside the Rules.


The Judge's Decision
5.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Baldwin (hereinafter called  "the  Judge")  dismissed  the
   appeal against the  Respondent's  decision.  The  Judge  found  that  the
   Appellant did not meet the requirements of Appendix FM and paragraph  276
   ADE for the reasons set out in the refusal letter.  He  also  found  that
   EX.1 did not apply to the Appellant as he was in the United Kingdom as  a
   visitor. The Judge found that there were arguable grounds for considering
   the case outside the Rules but nevertheless concluded that  the  decision
   to refuse leave was proportionate.
6. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on  20  May  2014  First-tier  tribunal
   Judge Reed gave permission to appeal stating that  the  Judge  failed  to
   properly explain why the Appellant could not  rely  on  Ex.1  or  in  the
   alternative why he did not meet the requirements of EX.1

7. At the hearing I  heard  submissions  from  Ms  Yong  on  behalf  of  the
   Appellant that in essence:

   a) Counsel raised the  issue  of  the  interpretation  of  the  mandatory
      Immigration Status requirements in  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  the
      skeleton argument and would not have done so had he  not  intended  to
      advance the same argument before the Judge hearing the appeal.

   b) If the Judge did not accept that Ex.1 applied counsel was arguing that
      Article 8 applied in the alternative.

   c) The Judge misdirected himself that EX.1 did not apply to  visitors  as
      to accept that meant that someone  with  no  leave  was  in  a  better
      position that someone lawfully in the United Kingdom as a visitor.

   d) Where it states in E-LTRP.2.1(c) '(unless  paragraph  Ex.1.  applies)'
      that relates to both (a) (b) and (c).

   e) Therefore the Judge did not make any findings in relation  to  whether
      the Appellant met the specific requirements of EX.1.

   f) The Judge's assessment under Article 8 was flawed in relation  to  the
      reasonableness of relocation.

8. On behalf of the Respondent  Mr Whitwell submitted that :

   a) At paragraph 23 the Judge had recorded that counsel conceded that this
      case was a freestanding application under Article 8 outside the Rules.

   b) Sabir makes clear that Ex.1 is not a  freestanding  provision  but  is
      parasitic on other provisions.

   c) The Appellant cannot benefit from Ex.1 if he is in the United  Kingdom
      as a visitor or with leave for less than 6 months:  no  switching  was
      permitted.

   d) Mr Solomon had not retained conduct of the case or provided a  witness
      statement to assert that no such submission was made. He may well have
      said in grounds or a skeleton argument that he intended to argue  EX.1
      but the decision post dates those documents and the  decision  records
      that such a concession was made.

   e) In relation to Article 8 he relied on the case of Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department v Hayat (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054  :  it
      was proportionate to require the Appellant to return  to  Pakistan  to
      make a proper application and there were sound reasons for doing so.

   f) It was not disproportionate to require the Appellant like every  other
      applicant in his situation to meet the requirements of  the  Rules  in
      relation to maintenance.

   g) The determination cannot be criticised. All issues that were  relevant
      to the best interests of the child were  considered  and  it  was  not
      being suggested that the child should leave the United Kingdom.

9. In reply Ms Yong on behalf of the Appellant submitted:

   a. The rule against switching could not be  correct  as  it  meant  those
      without leave were treated better than those with leave.

   b.  She relied on Chikwamba and suggested that whether the Appellant  met
      the Rules or not was irrelevant to the assessment made.

   c. Hayat was not applicable as it did  not  relate  to  a  child  so  the
      balancing factors were different.

   d. She suggested that it was relevant  that  the  medical  condition  the
      child was suffering from was detected in the United  Kingdom  although
      Mr Whitwell did not accept that this was the basis on which the matter
      was argued for the First-Tier Judge.
Finding on Material Error

10. Having heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made no material errors of law.

11. The Appellant in this case does not meet the financial  requirements  of
   Appendix FM but, it is argued by Ms Yong, could be eligible for leave  on
   the basis of EX.1 as he has both  a  partner  and  child  in  the  United
   Kingdom.

12. The refusal letter had stated that the Appellant could not benefit  from
   EX.1 as he came to the United Kingdom as a visitor  and  therefore  could
   not meet the mandatory Immigration Status Requirements which provide:
   "Immigration status requirements
    E-LTRP.2.1. The applicant must not be in the UK-

   (a) as a visitor;

   (b) with valid leave granted for a period of 6  months  or  less,  unless
   that leave is as a fiancï¿½(e) or proposed civil partner,  or  was  granted
   pending the outcome of family court or divorce proceedings; or

   (c) on temporary admission or temporary release (unless  paragraph  EX.1.
   applies)."

13. Ms Yong quite rightly did not  seek  to  argue  that  EX.1  was  a  free
   standing provision but she argued that the route to it was  open  to  all
   those in  sub  paragraphs  (a)  (b)  and  (c)  whose  circumstances  were
   described under the heading Immigration Status requirements.

14. In paragraph 20 of his determination the Judge found as a fact that  the
   Appellant came to the United Kingdom as a visitor and while he records Mr
   Solomon of counsels observation that it appeared  to  make  little  sense
   that EX.1 applied to those on temporary admission  or  temporary  release
   but not those here with leave from the outset and goes on the find:

   "However the fact that neither he nor I may be  able  to  understand  the
   logic of this does not mean that , if it is clear from the wording of the
   provisions that Ex.1 does not apply, that I should take the view that  it
   does apply."

15. I am satisfied that the Judge was entitled to reach this  conclusion  as
   it is the plain meaning of the section and I am satisfied that no further
   explanation was required: he was a visitor and there is no switching. Had
   EX.1 applied to sections (a)-(c)  the section would stated that it did.

16. The Judge accepted that there were  arguable  grounds  for  a  grant  of
   leave outside the Rules and therefore  looked  at  the  Appellant's  case
   under Article 8 at paragraph 23 having previously at paragraph 15 set out
   the questions that he would have to  address  in  making  his  assessment
   under Article 8.

17.  In essence the Judge found that it was not disproportionate to  require
   the Appellant to return to Pakistan and make an application if  and  when
   he could meet the requirements of the Rules. He identified that this  was
   not a case where the Appellant could meet the requirements and was simply
   being asked to make the proper out of country application as he found  as
   a fact that the evidence of a job offer the Appellant  had  produced  was
   not unequivocal nor was the salary sufficient to meet the requirements of
   the Rules.

18. He made that  finding  having  heard  and  accepted  evidence  from  the
   Appellant's wife who is a British Citizen that  she  and  their  children
   would choose to remain in the United Kingdom as the family felt it was in
   the best interest of the eldest child who suffered from CDH although  the
   Judge found at paragraph 19 that in fact there  was  no  reason  why  the
   family could not arrange to live near a hospital in Pakistan if  they  so
   chose and the  Appellant  is  highly  educated  and  could  pay  for  any
   treatment required. He took into account the best interests of the  child
   and it  is  implicit  in  his  decision  that  those  interests  are  not
   determinative of the appeal. I am satisfied that the Judge had taken into
   account all of the relevant factors under Article 8  and  his  conclusion
   that the Appellant should be required  to  return  to  Pakistan  make  an
   application when he could meet the requirements of the Rules was one that
   was open to him on the evidence.

19. The only factors not  addressed  in  the  Article  8  assessment  are  a
   failure to factor into the assessment the SSHD's interest in  maintaining
   immigration control, the failure of the Appellant to meet  the  financial
   and residence requirements of the Rules as set out  in  Appendix  FM  but
   this was not material to the outcome  as  they  are  further  factors  in
   favour of the decision.

CONCLUSION

20. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

21. The appeal is dismissed.
