Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms N Nnamani, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Julie Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless for the purposes of this decision I  shall  refer
    to the parties as they were described before the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    that is Mrs Halyna Hudkova as the Appellant and the Secretary of  State
    is the Respondent.

 2. The Appellant is a Ukrainian citizen born on 27th September 1974 and so
    41 years old as at the date of  my  consideration.   The  Appellant  is
    married to a Ukrainian citizen who settled in the United Kingdom.   The
    couple had married in November 1995 in the Ukraine.  The couple have  a
    daughter Anastasia born on 9th May 1996.

 3. In 1999 the Appellant's husband Mr Oleh Lohachov  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom leaving the Appellant and their daughter living in the Ukraine.
     The Appellant has two parents living in the Ukraine.  After the couple
    married the Appellant's husband's  grandparents  lived  with  them  and
    shortly after the Appellant's husband's mother was diagnosed with stage
    four cancer which resulted  in  her  having  her  leg  amputated.   The
    Appellant looked after the three elderly dependants and  her  daughter.
    In about 2000 the Appellant's husband's mother died and  shortly  after
    his grandmother died and his grandfather was diagnosed with stage three
    prostate cancer.  He subsequently passed away and  then  the  Appellant
    "moved" to the UK to support her husband. By which is it apparent  that
    what is meant is that the Appellant obtained a visit visa on the  basis
    of an intention to return but did  not  do  so.   The  Appellant's  own
    parents looked after her daughter. In  2005  the  Appellant's  daughter
    similarly travelled to the United Kingdom on a  visit  visa  which  she
    subsequently overstayed.

 4. In August 2013 the Appellant's husband was granted indefinite leave  to
    remain. The Appellant's husband has been employed for  the  last  seven
    years with a company called Sheer Products earning on  average  ï¿½30,000
    per year.

 5. The Appellant and her daughter made an application for indefinite leave
    to remain in February 2014 on the basis  of  the  Appellant's  daughter
    having resided in the United Kingdom for more than  seven  years.   The
    daughter has subsequently been granted discretionary  leave  to  remain
    until 11th March 2017.

 6. The Respondent's decision refusing the Appellant leave to remain on the
    basis of her family and private life was  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 7. Following a hearing on 17th February 2015 Judge S O'Brien  allowed  the
    appeal .

 8. The judge found that the Appellant did not meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules set out at Appendix FM.   The  route  of  parent  was
    closed as the daughter was over the age of 18.  In the context  of  the
    partner route the judge noted that the  Appellant's  partner  would  be
    able to return with her to the Ukraine where they would be able to look
    to the Appellant's parents for help in the short term so that  although
    the husband would face significant difficulties in  relocating  in  the
    context of having left the Ukraine sixteen years previously and  having
    had to sacrifice a well-established and well paid  job  in  the  United
    Kingdom, they would be able to turn  to  the  Appellant's  parents  who
    remained living in their own home, for support in the short term.   The
    judge found that the Appellant's husband's concerns that  he  would  be
    called up to the army unsupported by objective evidence.

 9. The judge nonetheless considered whether the Appellant could succeed on
    the basis of Article 8 outside of the Rules.

10. The judge noted that the  removal  was  lawful  and  necessary  in  the
    context of the legitimate aim to which effective immigration control is
    directed.  The judge reminded himself that the Appellant  had  made  no
    attempt to regularise her status over a considerable period of time and
    that in the context of  that  unlawful  residence  the  development  of
    private and family life should carry little weight.  The  judge  refers
    to the family being close-knit and the fact of the  earlier  period  of
    separation "through force of circumstance"  until  they  were  reunited
    here in 2005.  The judge states that the family are "rightly  reluctant
    to be separated again.  Indeed, it is Anastasia's desire to  live  with
    her parents while she completes  her  university  studies."  The  judge
    concluded that the Appellant enjoyed family life with her daughter  and
    husband, the family living as a unit with the  daughter  continuing  in
    full-time education.  The judge found that it would be unreasonable  to
    expect the daughter and husband to leave the  United  Kingdom,  because
    although the immigration rules could not be met  as  the  couple  could
    relocate to the Ukraine without facing  insurmountable  obstacles,  the
    rules did not make adequate provision  respecting  the  rights  of  the
    adult daughter who resided  with  them  as  a  dependent  student,  and
    consequently  removal  would  breach  the  Article  8  rights  of   the
    Appellant, her husband and their daughter.

11. The Respondent's application for permission to appeal  was  granted  on
    the basis that the judge had failed to adequately articulate why family
    life existed between the Appellant and her daughter, who is  an  adult,
    and failed to weigh the public interest appropriately as  described  in
    Section 117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,
    particularly on account of her poor immigration  history,  or  to  give
    appropriate weight to the inability to meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

12. Those  grounds  were  maintained  before  me  when  Ms  Isherwood  made
    submissions which, whilst fleshing out the grounds,  in  substance  did
    not vary from them.

13. For the Appellant Ms Nnamani relied on the  Rule  24  response  to  the
    point that the finding that the Appellant,  her  husband  and  daughter
    lived as a family unit in the context of the daughter's continuing full-
    time education at university was sufficient to  found  a  finding  that
    family life with the daughter was engaged.  In respect of the weight of
    the proportionality exercise the judge had had the benefit  of  hearing
    and seeing the Appellant and her family give evidence, had the  benefit
    of detailed documentary evidence of the character and  quality  of  the
    family life enjoyed in the United Kingdom, and was entitled to conclude
    that it was unreasonable to expect either the husband  or  daughter  to
    leave the United Kingdom with the Appellant in order to  maintain  that
    family life.

14. I am satisfied that the judge's decision reveals a  material  error  of
    law for failure to adequately weigh the public interest  considerations
    at Section 117B of the  NIAA  2002.  Additionally  even  if  there  was
    evidence before the judge substantiating the claim to enjoy family life
    within the meaning of Article 8 with her daughter it  did  not  relieve
    the judge  of  the  duty  of  identifying  it  and  explaining  why  he
    considered that it was not adequately dealt with by  the  consideration
    under the Rules.

15. I set the decision aside. I heard submissions as to how to  proceed  to
    deal with the Appellant's case if I decided,  as  I  have,  to  set  it
    aside.  There is no application to  adduce  further  evidence  and  the
    representatives were content that  I  should  proceed  without  further
    hearing to remake the decision on the evidence as it was.

16. The argument for the Appellant is that the presence of the daughter  in
    the UK household, as a student financially dependent on her parents and
    receiving their emotional support, renders the position under the rules
    an inadequate response to their family position.

17. Relocation in the context of Article 8 encompasses not  only  permanent
    relocation as the rules  do,  but  also  temporary  relocation  by  the
    Appellant with  or  without  her  husband,    in  order  to  bring  the
    Appellant within the rules by making an application for entry clearance
    from abroad.

18. S117 of  the  2002  Act  informs  the  evaluation  of  proportionality,
    containing factors that must be taken into account, and indicates  that
    the public interest is in maintaining immigration control.

19. The First-tier Tribunal's decision  under  the  Immigration  rules  was
    unchallenged before me, so that that part of  the  judgment,  and   the
    factual findings on which it relies,   remain:  the  husband  and  wife
    could relocate permanently to the Ukraine remain.

20. Family life was formed in the Ukraine at a time when both lived  there.
    It remained a family life in the Ukraine when the husband came here  in
    1999. The husband's stay here was precarious in the sense that  it  was
    limited, whilst he could return to the Ukraine his wife could not  come
    here without restriction. The family locus, in terms of home and hearth
    was in the Ukraine, so that family life came to  be  enjoyed  with  the
    wife living in  the  Ukraine  and  the  husband  living  with  her  but
    travelling to work abroad in the UK.  Choices, such as the ones made by
    this couple, necessarily include choices about how they  are  going  to
    enjoy their family life. I find that the family  life  is  plainly  one
    deserving respect, so as to  engage  Article  8:  the  relationship  is
    longstanding; there is a child of the union, now  in  the  UK  studying
    with limited leave and  living  with  the  couple,  dependent  on  them
    financially, and receiving emotional support as is common between adult
    children living at home studying with supportive parents.  Whilst  that
    situation may not be uncommon, it is sufficient to provide a degree  of
    dependence sufficient to find that family  life  continues  beyond  the
    formal age of maturity ordinarily denoting independence of  the  family
    unit.  I am satisfied that the family life of  the  Appellant  includes
    not only  her  relationship  with  her  husband  but  also  with  their
    dependent daughter.

21. I consider the impact of removal and the claimed interference.

22. The uncontested findings of the first tier  tribunal  are  that  should
    the Appellant's husband decide to return  with  the  Appellant  to  the
    Ukraine and live there permanently, leaving their daughter in full-time
    education in the United Kingdom, there  are  simply  not  the  sort  of
    obstacles to reintegration that would make that position  so  difficult
    for the partner or Appellant that they have any entitlement  to  remain
    under the Rules.

23. The evidence does not identify anything in respect  of  the  daughter's
    circumstances here which means that she would  be  required  to  return
    with them, as Ms Isherwood pointed out this is not the first time  that
    the Appellant has been separated from her daughter because that was the
    position of choice of the Appellant and her husband when the child  was
    a minor. If the reality is that the parents cannot so afford, then they
    have the option of the father remaining so as to support  the  daughter
    here, including the  additional  option  of  the  Appellant  making  an
    application to re-enter.

24. The daughter is not a minor now so that in respect of Section 117B  the
    weight to be attached to the public interest  is  not  reduced  by  the
    presence of any qualifying child.

25.  The  Appellant's  ability  to  speak  English,   and   the   financial
    independence obtained through her husband  do  not  give  rise  to  any
    positive right to a grant of leave to remain (AM (Section 117B)  Malawi
    [2015] UKUT 00260 (IAC)).

26.  S117 B (4)(a)  indicates that little  weight  should  be  given  to  a
    private life developed in the context  of  unlawful  residence,  whilst
    S117 (4) (b) states  that  a  family  life  formed  with  a  qualifying
    partner, that is  established  when the person is in the UK unlawfully,
    should be given little weight, this is not such a relationship.  S  117
    B (4) (a)  does not direct that  such  a  family  life  carries  little
    weight; it is silent about the weight  to  be  attached,  so  that  the
    weight to be attached falls for evaluation on its facts, in  the  usual
    way.

27. There is no absolute right for the family to enjoy their family life as
    they currently experience it in the UK.

28. In the event that the couple chose that the  Appellant  should  make  a
    fresh application in the Ukraine, the question of disproportionality of
    temporary separation is not addressed in Appendix FM.  The case of Chen
    [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) addresses the impact  of  temporary  separation
    and the principles first established in the case  of  Chikwamba  [2008]
    UKHL  40.  This  is  not  a  Chikwamba  case  where   there   were   no
    countervailing  factors.   This  is  a  case  where   the   Appellant's
    immigration status has always been understood by  the  parties  to  the
    marriage. The history reveals  an  extensive  period  of  unlawfulness,
    including in the context of contact with the authorities in relation to
    the  daughter's  subsequent  visit  and  overstay,  and  the   father's
    obtaining of indefinite leave in 2013.

29. In short although the relationship was not formed  in  the  context  of
    known unlawful residence here, the family life established here, as  it
    now is, has been established in the context of unlawful residence.

30. There are  no  compelling  or  compassionate  circumstances,  including
    taking account of the position of the  daughter,  which  warrant  leave
    outside of the immigration rules.

31. I find that removal of the Appellant will not give rise to  any  breach
    of Article 8 rights of the Appellant or her family.

Decision

32. The decision of the First tier -Tribunal in respect  of  Article  8  is
    vitiated by error and I set it aside to remake the decision  dismissing
    the Appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds. The decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing the appeal on Immigration Rules stands.

33. No anonymity direction is made.
