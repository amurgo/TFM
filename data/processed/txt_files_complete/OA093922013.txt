Representation:

For the Appellant (Entry Clearance Officer):  Mr I Jarvis, Home Office
Presenting Officer
For the Respondent (Mrs Yadollahi):     Mr D Hart, legal representative
                                   (non-practising barrister) of Matini
                                   Montecristo Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's  appeal  against  a  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Walters allowing an appeal by  Mrs  Yadollahi
    against a decision made by the Entry  Clearance  Officer  refusing  Mrs
    Yadollahi's application for leave to enter this country  as  a  spouse.
    For ease of reference I shall refer throughout  this  determination  to
    the Entry Clearance Officer (who was the original respondent)  as  "the
    ECO" and to Mrs Yadollahi (who was  the  original  appellant)  as  "the
    claimant".

 2. The claimant who was born on 15 July 1985 is a citizen of Iran  who  is
    married to the sponsor.  As noted, her application for entry  clearance
    to allow her to join her husband as a spouse was refused by the ECO and
    she appealed against this decision.  Her appeal was heard before First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Walters sitting at Taylor House on 13 February 2014
    and in a determination promulgated  on  3  March  2014,  Judge  Walters
    allowed her appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The ECO now appeals  against  that  decision,  permission  having  been
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy on 19 March 2014.

 4. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this determination to go  into  a
    great deal of detail but  the  grounds  of  appeal  can  be  summarised
    briefly.  In order to comply with the requirements under the  Rules  it
    is necessary for an applicant for entry clearance as a spouse  to  show
    not only that  there  is  a  subsisting  marriage  and  that  there  is
    satisfactory accommodation but also that the financial requirements (in
    this case that there would be an income available of  �18,600  a  year)
    are established by the production of specified documents.   It  is  not
    necessary for these documents to have been produced at the time of  the
    application but insofar as it is said that the necessary income is as a
    result of salaried employment, it is necessary at some  time  for  wage
    slips and other documents to be provided for a six month  period  prior
    to the date of application.  At the time of the  hearing  before  Judge
    Walters it is accepted that  these  documents  had  not  in  fact  been
    provided.

 5. It would seem that Judge Walters was unaware of the requirements  under
    the Rules because at paragraph 40 of his determination he states  that:
    "I was unable to find a list of specified documents,  however,  in  the
    Immigration Rules".  These are in  fact  set  out  in  paragraph  2  of
    Appendix FM-SE of the Rules (and if he had looked this up in the Eighth
    Edition of Phelan and Gillespie Immigration Law Handbook 2013 he  would
    have found this reproduced at page 1059).  The relevant requirement  is
    as follows:

         "2.  In respect of salaried  employment  in  the  UK,  all  of  the
             following evidence must be provided:

             ... [The relevant information which is required  is  then  set
             out which includes wage slips covering a period of six  months
             prior to the date of application if  the  applicant  has  been
             employed by their current employer for at least six months]".

 6. Because Judge Walters was not aware of the provisions within the  Rules
    he did not consider them.  Had he done so on the basis of the  evidence
    which was before him he would not have been able to allow  the  appeal.
    It  follows  that  the  judge's  failure  to  consider   properly   the
    application of the relevant Rules was a material error of law and I  so
    find.  It follows that I must remake the decision.

 7. Fortunately for the claimant matters have moved on  since  the  hearing
    before Judge Walters as will appear below.  Equally fortunately for the
    claimant not only  was  he  represented  by  an  advocate  who  clearly
    understands the Rules extremely well and was able to  give  very  great
    assistance to this Tribunal but also the  ECO  was  represented  by  Mr
    Jarvis who with his typical fairness was  prepared  to  consider  fresh
    documents which were now put before the Tribunal.  Mr Hart was able  to
    refer both Mr Jarvis and  the  Tribunal  to  the  appropriate  guidance
    document in the Immigration  Directorate  Instructions  in  which  with
    regard to Appendix FM at 1.7 it is provided that  the  calculation  for
    gross earnings is carried out by reference to a  six  month  period  of
    evidence and that effectively it boils down to a calculation  based  on
    gross average earnings over that six month period multiplied  by  2  to
    assess what a twelve month income is.  Mr Jarvis very fairly  told  the
    Tribunal that with the help of Mr Hart  it  could  be  shown  from  the
    documents submitted on  behalf  of  the  claimant  which  the  ECO  now
    accepted that the sponsor's income amounted to �1,550 per month  gross.
    It was accepted that the wage slips which were required under the Rules
    for a six month period ending with the date of application had now been
    supplied and that also the Tribunal had been now supplied with the bank
    statements showing the net income being  paid  into  the  bank  account
    which is a requirement of part  2  of  FM-SE.   The  calculation  which
    appears to be used by caseworkers in accordance with  the  guidance  to
    which  the  Tribunal  was  referred  indicated   that   the   financial
    requirements under the Rules were satisfied.

 8. Pursuant to section 85(4) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 on an appeal under section  82(1)  of  that  Act  (which  this
    appeal is) the Tribunal

         "may consider evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant to
         the substance of the decision, including evidence which concerns  a
         matter arising after the date of the decision".

    However, by section 85(5) subsection (4) "is subject to the  exceptions
    in section 85A".

 9. The relevant exception in this case is set out at section 85A(2)  which
    is that

         "in  relation  to  an  appeal  under  section  82(1)   against   an
         immigration decision of a kind specified in section 82(2)(b) or (c)
         the Tribunal may consider only the  circumstances  appertaining  at
         the date of the decision".

    The decision being appealed against is of a kind specified  in  section
    82(2)(b) being a refusal of entry clearance and so for the purposes  of
    this appeal I may consider only the circumstances appertaining  at  the
    date of the decision.  However, that does not mean that I am  precluded
    from considering evidence which was not available at the  time  of  the
    decision  (or  indeed  at  the  time  that  Judge  Walters   made   his
    determination) but I may consider any evidence appertaining to the date
    of  decision  which  obviously  includes  the  evidence  which  is   in
    compliance with the requirements under the Rules.  It follows  that  Mr
    Jarvis is  right  in  accepting  that  the  evidence  now  provided  is
    admissible for the purposes of this appeal.  It is accepted  on  behalf
    of the ECO that the only basis upon which the  appeal  was  or  remains
    contested is that it had been argued that  the  financial  requirements
    were not satisfied in accordance with the specific requirements  within
    Appendix FM-SE and as it is now accepted on behalf of the ECO  that  in
    fact the financial requirements have been met in  accordance  with  the
    Rules it follows that this appeal must be allowed and I will so order.

Decision

I set aside the determination of the First-tier Tribunal, which had  allowed
the claimant's appeal but I substitute the same  decision  in  substance  as
had been made as follows:

The claimant's appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.



Signed:                                 Date: 18 June 2014
