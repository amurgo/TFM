Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr B Hone, Counsel instructed by Westkin Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen  of  India  and  her  date  of  birth  is  8
    February 1971. On 5 February 2013 she made an application to  vary  her
    leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) under the  points-
    based system.  Her application was refused on 4 February 2014.

2.       The decision-maker refused the application on  the  basis  that  it
    was not genuine. It was noted  that  the  �50,000  that  the  appellant
    claimed that she intended to invest in the company was given to her  by
    Mr Law whom she  met  in  the  British  Library  when  researching  her
    company.  The appellant did not  clarify  how  long  she  had  been  in
    possession of the money from Mr Law The decision-maker went on to state
    that the  appellant  had  failed  to  take  substantial  steps  towards
    establishing a business.

3.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and her appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Troup,
    in a decision dated 12 May 2014, following a hearing  on  6  May  2014.
    The appellant made an application for permission for  leave  to  appeal
    which was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal V A Osborne, in a
    decision of 23 June 2014. Thus the matter came before me.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

4.    The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from both the appellant and  Mr
    Law.  The parties were both represented at the hearing.  The Judge made
    findings at paragraphs 20 to 28 of the determination as follows:

         "20. Miss Jones simply told me that she relied upon the contents of
             the Refusal Letter.


             Miss Norman produced her  Skeleton  Argument.   She  submitted
             that Paragraph 245DD(h)-(l) which is reproduced at paragraph 3
             of the Skeleton, sets very concise parameters.


             The first issue is whether Mrs Sharma has become a director of
             a business in the UK and continues  to  operate  it.   It  was
             submitted that that requirement is met, and as evidence of  it
             I was referred to:-


                . The 2013 Business Plan that  accompanied  the  application
                  and the amended Business Plan (2014) at pages 8-22 of  the
                  Appellant's Bundle.
                .  The  company's  'Customer  Management  List'  at  page  7
                  containing  details  of  nine  clients  acquired   between
                  January 2013 and April 2014.
                . The company's bank statement at page 23 containing a debit
                  entry on 1 April 2014 for an insurance premium  of  �16.13
                  payable to AXA Insurance.
                . A credit of �300 on 15 April in the  same  bank  statement
                  from AS Asia Company (being one of the companies listed in
                  the Customer Management List).
                . A cheque payable to the company  from  Devan  Construction
                  Limited for �300 dated 24 April 2014: they also appear  in
                  the Customer Management List.
                . A 'Contract Completion Letter' from AS Asia at page 50  of
                  the Bundle saying that they had received services from the
                  company which were completed on 4 April 2014.


         21.  It was submitted that on that evidence  it  is  more  probable
             than not that the Appellant is a director of the company which
             continues to trade.


             I accept the submission.  The company is incorporated and from
             the Share Certificate and the witness statement, I find it  to
             be more probable than not that Mrs Sharma is  a  Director  and
             Shareholder.


         22.  From the first Business Plan  I  note  that  the  company  had
             ambitions to generate a gross income of �34,200 in  its  first
             year of trading (2013/14).  It has  fallen  a  very  long  way
             short of that ambition however.  �300 was credited to the bank
             account on 15 January 2013, �300 on 15 April 2014 and there is
             a cheque for the same amount dated  24  April  2014  and  thus
             there is evidence of a gross income of only �900.


             However, that evidence, together with the Business Plans,  the
             Agreement with Zenith (which seems to have produced no  income
             for the company) and the proposal put to the Nepalese Catering
             Association indicate that the company is trading, albeit at  a
             very low level.  I conclude from that that the requirements of
             Paragraph 245DD(h)(i) are met.


         23.  The second limb of the appeal is Ms Norman's invitation to the
             Tribunal to accept for the purposes of (h)(iii)  that  Mr  Law
             has genuinely provided funds of �50,000 and that  they  remain
             available for the company's use.


         24.  I am satisfied from the oral and documentary evidence that  Mr
             Law provided those funds.  I must go on  however  to  consider
             the requirements of (h)(ii), namely the  question  of  whether
             Mrs Sharma genuinely intends to  invest  the  money  into  the
             business.


             To answer that question I  must  examine  the  nature  of  the
             business and its capital needs.  Mrs Sharma has an MBA  in  HR
             Management and the company is in reality an alter ego for  the
             presentation of her specialist expertise.


             The 2013 Business Plan at paragraph 4 puts the start-up  costs
             at �1,600 and declares that 'start up capital is  low  because
             the owner will be initially working  from  home  with  minimum
             infrastructure...'.


         25.  The cash flow forecast in  the  Business  Plan  talks  of  the
             company's  '...strong  liquidity  position  which  helps   the
             company by  providing  cushion  against  emergencies  and  its
             ability to utilise business opportunities in  a  better  way'.
             The 'Financial plan' at paragraph  10  of  the  Business  Plan
             however makes no reference at  all  to  capital  requirements.
             Indeed, the plan implies that there are no  capital  needs  as
             the business is personal to the 'owner', that is  to  say  Mrs
             Sharma.


         26.  There is no evidence before me  that  Mrs  Sharma  intends  to
             invest money in  the  business  or,  if  she  does,  for  what
             purpose, when and in what amounts.   The  financial  forecasts
             anticipate that income will outstrip expenses year by year and
             there is no suggestion of a need for capital in any amount.


         27.  It follows from that conclusion that I am not satisfied to the
             required  standard  that  Mrs  Sharma  intends,  as  Paragraph
             245DD(h)(ii) requires, to invest the sum  of  �50,000  in  the
             business as there is simply no need to do so.


         28.  That conclusion leads me on to (h)(iii) and  the  question  of
             whether the funds are 'genuinely available' to Mrs Sharma.   I
             have found that Mr Law has provided �50,000 to  her  and  that
             that sum remains 'available'.  I am not satisfied however that
             it is genuinely available.


             Mrs Sharma has singularly failed  to  identify  any  need  for
             capital.  I am not told where the fund is kept at present  (it
             was not in the company's account in March/April 2014) but,  be
             that as it may, and taking the Business Plan  at  face  value,
             there is no capital requirement.


             The cash flow forecast spreadsheet at page 16  of  the  Bundle
             refers to loans from Directors but the purpose of  such  loans
             is not apparent and is,  in  any  case,  contradicted  by  the
             forecasts  at  part  10  of  the  2014  Business  Plan.    If,
             therefore, the funds are to be genuinely available, they  must
             for an identified need.  I find that no such need is made  out
             and thus there is no  genuine  purpose  for  the  fund  to  be
             available.  It follows therefore that I am not satisfied  that
             the requirements of sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) are made out
             and I must dismiss the appeal under the Rules."


The Grounds Seeking Leave to Appeal and Oral Submissions

5.   The grounds argue that the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    perverse because the Judge accepted the evidence of the  appellant  and
    Mr Law and found them to be credible and on that basis he  allowed  the
    appeal under paragraph 245 DD (h) (i) and  (ii).   The  Judge  accepted
    that there was an operating business.  The Judge did  not  address  the
    supporting evidence of emails and the business plan  which  showed  the
    cash flow forecast which  indicated  that  the  appellant  intended  to
    invest �50,000.

6.   Both parties  made  oral  submissions.   Mr  Hone  submitted  that  the
    evidence showed that the capital was needed for growth and expansion of
    the business and he referred me to Appendix B of the business  plan  at
    page 16 which indicated that there would be a loan from the director in
    year 1 (2014-15) of �15,000 and in year 2 (2015-16) of �25,000  and  in
    year 3 (2016-17) of �10,000.  The business plan  therefore  showed  how
    the capital of �50,000 would be invested in the business.

Conclusions

7.   In my view the findings of the Judge are not perverse.  It was open  to
    the Judge to find that the appellant  was  able  to  satisfy  Rule  245
    (h)(i) (which requires in this case that the appellant has  established
    or become a director of one or more businesses and continues to operate
    the  business),  but  not  (ii)  (which  requires  that  the  applicant
    genuinely intends to invest the money in the business) and (iii) (which
    requires that the money is genuinely available  to  the  appellant  and
    will remain available to her until such a time as it is spent  for  the
    purposes of his business). Contrary to the  grounds  seeking  leave  to
    appeal the Judge did not find favour of the appellant  under  Rule  245
    (h) (iii).  The Judge did not find that the appellant or  Mr  Law  were
    credible witnesses. He found that is was more probable  than  not  that
    the appellant was a director of the company which  continues  to  trade
    and thus she satisfied Rule 245 (h)(i).

8.   The appellant's argument is that the Judge erred  because  he  did  not
    take into account the business plan at Appendix  B.    However,  it  is
    clear from [28] of the determination that the Judge took  into  account
    the business plan and the cash flow forecast at Appendix B.  The  Judge
    found that there  was  no  genuine  need  identified  for  the  �50,000
    investment in the business and concluded  that  there  was  no  genuine
    intention to invest this money.  The  Judge  found  that  the  cashflow
    forecast was not consistent with the financial forecast at part  10  of
    the  business  plan  because  the  financial  forecast  does  not  make
    reference to the investment of �50,000.

9.   It was open to the Judge to conclude that  the  financial  forecast  at
    part 10 of the business plan, which shows income  and  expenditure,  is
    not consistent with the cashflow forecast. The appellant's evidence  is
    that that the sum of �50,000 was not a gift as such but Mr Law hopes to
    receive a return on it in the future. Were it to be a gift  or  a  loan
    (liability) one would expect it to feature as income or expenditure  in
    the financial forecast at part 10 of the business plan, but it  is  not
    apparent from the figures.  Mr Hone's submission to  me  was  that  the
    investment of �50,000 was needed to expand the business, but the  Judge
    was entitled to conclude that this was not made out. I  note  that  the
    figure for expenditure in the financial forecast  at  part  10  of  the
    business plan includes staff costs that increase over the period. There
    is no evidence that the investment of �50,000 is needed to cover  these
    costs. On the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, it was  open  to
    the Judge to find that there was no business need  for  the  investment
    made out. There is no requirement under the Rules  that  the  appellant
    must show the need for investment or that the business must be shown to
    be making a profit in accordance with the projections in  the  business
    plan, but these are factors to which the Judge was entitled  to  attach
    weight when determining intention (particularly in  the  light  of  the
    circumstances of the "loan".)  It was open to the Judge to dismiss  the
    appeal under paragraph 245 DD (h) (ii).

10.    The Judge also dismissed the  appeal  under  Rule  245  h(iii)    The
    Judge found that the sum of money has been provided by Mr  Law  to  the
    appellant, but that it is not genuinely available to her.  His  finding
    is ambiguous and it may be that he has conflated 245h (ii)  and  (iii).
    There was also evidence before the Judge that in March/April  2014  the
    funds were in the appellant's personal account. In any  event,  whether
    or not the Judge erred in this respect  is  not  material  because  his
    decision under 245 h (ii) is lawful and sustainable.

11.    In my view there is no material error of law  and  the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal and the decision to dismiss the appeal under
    the Rules is maintained.
