               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

For the Appellant:     Mr A Barnfield of Migrant Legal Project
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated  23  April  2015,  to
    refuse asylum.  That  appeal  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Barrowclough (the judge), who on 16 November 2015 dismissed the  appeal
    on Refugee Convention and Humanitarian Protection grounds  as  well  as
    Article 8 ECHR grounds.

2.   The submissions do not effectively challenge the Article 8 decision.

3.   Permission to appeal was given by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kimnell  on
    14 December 2015.  At the hearing on 27 June 2016  it  became  entirely
    apparent upon a reading of the judge's decision that he simply had  not
    considered the background evidence and the expert's report provided  in
    the analysis and criticisms that he made of the Appellant's  case.   In
    particular it is most unfortunate that the  judge  makes  no  reference
    whatsoever to the existence of  the  expert's  report.   Whilst  it  is
    correct to say that the expert presumes at paragraph 4 of the report to
    decide for herself the  risk  to  the  Appellant  in  China,  a  matter
    undoubtedly solely for the judge, nevertheless the evidence on a  wider
    basis including the extent of the Appellant's knowledge and  experience
    in the PRC were matters pertinent to the assessment of the  credibility
    of the claim and the reliability of the evidence.

4.   The total omission of that material means that  the  Original  Tribunal
    made an error of law.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The Original Tribunal's decision cannot stand.  The matter must be remade.
