Representation

At the appeal hearings before the  Upper  Tribunal  all  Appellants,  except
Kashif Nazir and Muhammad Usman Qayyum, were represented by Mr  Z  Jafferji,
of counsel, instructed by direct professional access.

Mr H Ali from Wiseman Solicitors appeared on behalf of a  former  Appellant,
Kashif Nazir (to confirm his client's withdrawal of his appeal).

At the first appeal hearing on  18  April  2016  the  interested  party  was
represented by Mr Z Malik, of Counsel and at the second  appeal  hearing  on
04 May 2016 the interested  party  participated  via  a  written  submission
only, prepared by Mr D Balroop, of counsel,  both  instructed  by  City  Law
Practice Solicitors.

The Secretary of State  was  represented  by  Ms  C  Rowlands,  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department.

     i) The effect of the amendment of the regime  in  paragraph  41/SD  of
        Appendix A to the Immigration Rules via HC628, dated  06  September
        2013, is that any application for entry  clearance  or  leave  made
        before 01 October 2013 is to be  decided  in  accordance  with  the
        Rules in force on 30 September 2013.


    ii) Every applicant for Tier 1 Entrepreneurial status bears the onus of
        proving satisfaction of all of the  material  requirements  of  the
        Immigration Rules.

   iii) The Rules stipulate that every  Tier  1  Entrepreneurial  applicant
        have available �50,000 to invest in the proposed business  venture.
        "Available" in this context denotes that the applicant must be in a
        position to invest this money in his business consequential upon  a
        positive decision of the Secretary of State.  The clear  import  of
        the Rules is that the investment must  be  capable  of  being  made
        almost immediately thereafter.

    iv) A mere intention on the part of a Tier 1 Entrepreneurial  applicant
        to invest �25,000 at the outset of the  business  venture,  coupled
        with a further intention to invest the balance of �25,000  at  some
        unspecified future date from  some  unspecified  source,  does  not
        satisfy the Rules.


                                  DECISION

Preliminary

 1. This  is  the  decision  of  the  panel  to  which  both  members  have
    contributed.


 2. The number of Appellants has shrunk since these appeals  were  launched
    initially. There were  thirteen  Appellants  at  first  instance.   The
    active Appellants, for sundry reasons, have now reduced to nine. At the
    outset of the hearings, Mr H Ali of Wiseman  Solicitors,  attended  and
    helpfully informed the Tribunal  that  while  he  had  previously  been
    instructed on behalf of the eleventh Appellant,  Muhammad  Qayyum,  his
    instructions have lapsed and his understanding is that  this  Appellant
    has departed the United Kingdom.


 3. Two of the original Appellants, Kashif Nazir and Muhammad Usman Qayyum,
    have been granted permission  to  withdraw  their  respective  appeals.
    Neither was represented at the hearing and neither attended.

 4. Following the hearing the Tribunal took the  precaution  of  issuing  a
    formal direction, the response whereto confirmed the withdrawals  noted
    in [3] above.

Introduction

 5. The Appellants have much in  common.   Each  of  them  applied  to  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (the "Secretary of  State"),
    the Respondent to these appeals, for leave to remain in the capacity of
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the  relevant  compartment  of  the
    Immigration Rules (hereinafter the "Rules").  These  applications  were
    made in various permutations: some of  the  Appellants  applied  in  an
    individual capacity; others applied as partnerships; and  some  of  the
    applications included dependants.  While all of the  refusal  decisions
    have individual  variations,  certain  critical  aspects  of  them  are
    couched in substantially indistinguishable terms.  In the wake of these
    refusal decisions, the Secretary of State  made  further  decisions  to
    remove each of the Appellants under  section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (the "2006 Act").

 1. We record at this juncture that this batch  of  appeals  was  selected,
    with heavy input from the parties' representatives,  as  representative
    of a category of some 140 appeals  to  the  FtT,  all  of  which  raise
    comparable issues.  It suffices at  this  juncture  to  note  that  the
    central feature common to all is that every appellant  made  a  Tier  1
    visa application based on a representation that  the  entity  known  as
    Profectus Venture Capital (later becoming Profectus Venture Capital LLP
    - "Profectus") would provide the funding of  �50,000  required  by  the
    Rules.  All of these applications have been refused. The  Secretary  of
    State has found this funding scheme to be seriously flawed.

 2. While there were 13 Appellants altogether, reflecting the  fact  of  13
    refusal decisions, the Tier 1 applications considered, and refused,  by
    the Secretary of State involved a total of six business proposals only.
     The figure of 13 was made  up  by  a  mixture  of  individual  Tier  1
    applicants, other  applicants  applying  with  business  partners  and,
    finally, as observed above, the dependants of certain  applicants.  The
    proposed business ventures ranged from a hair dressing/beauty salon  to
    the supply of halal meat.  All 13 applications  were  made  during  the
    period of January to April 2013.  All of the Appellants appealed to the
    First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT").  By its  decision  promulgated  on  16
    July 2015 the FtT dismissed all  appeals.  In  doing  so  the  FtT,  in
    substance,  endorsed  the  Secretary  of  State's  reservations.    The
    question for this Tribunal, on  further  appeal,  is  whether  the  FtT
    committed any material error of law in doing so within the  compass  of
    the grant of permission to appeal (infra).

The Immigration Rules

 6. In order to understand the underlying decisions  of  the  Secretary  of
    State, it is necessary to begin with the  relevant  provisions  of  the
    Rules.  Paragraph 245 DD(h), under  the  rubric  of  "Requirements  for
    Leave to remain" provides:

         "Where the applicant is being assessed under Table 4 of Appendix A,
         the Secretary of State must be satisfied that:


         (i)  the applicant genuinely:


             (1)   intends and is able to establish, take over or become  a
                  director of one or more businesses in the  UK  within  the
                  next six months, or
             (2)  has established, taken over or become a director  of  one
                  or more businesses in the UK and continues to operate that
                  business or businesses; and


         (ii) the applicant genuinely intends to invest the  money  referred
             to in Table 4 of Appendix A  in  the  business  or  businesses
             referred to in (i);


         (iii)    the money  referred  to  in  Table  4  of  Appendix  A  is
             genuinely  available  to  the  applicant,  and   will   remain
             available to him until such  time  as  it  is  spent  for  the
             purposes of his business or businesses;


         (iv)  if  the  applicant  is  relying  on  one  or  more   previous
             investments to score points, they have genuinely invested  all
             or part of  the  investment  funds  required  in  Table  4  of
             Appendix A into one or more genuine businesses in the UK;


         (v)  that the applicant does not intend to take employment  in  the
             United Kingdom other than under the terms of paragraph 245DE."



    Paragraph 245 DD(j) provides:

         "In making the assessment in  (h),  the  Secretary  of  State  will
         assess the balance of probabilities.  The Secretary  of  State  may
         take into account the following factors:


         (i)  the evidence the applicant has submitted;


         (ii) the viability and credibility  of  the  source  of  the  money
             referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;


         (iii)    the viability and credibility of the applicant's  business
             plans and market research into their chosen business sector;


         (iv) the applicant's previous educational and  business  experience
             (or lack thereof);


         (v)  the applicant's immigration history and previous  activity  in
             the UK;


         (vi) where the applicant has already registered in the UK as  self-
             employed or as the director of a business, and the  nature  of
             the business requires  mandatory  accreditation,  registration
             and/or insurance,  whether  that  accreditation,  registration
             and/or insurance has been obtained; and


         (vii)    any other relevant information."

    The underlining is ours.


 7. The terms of Appendix 1, paragraph 41-SD of the Rules in force  on  the
    dates when the underlying applications were made, January - April 2013,
    are reproduced in Appendix 1 hereto.  The densely  prescriptive  nature
    of this regime is, by some measure, its most striking feature.  At  its
    heart lies a requirement that all Tier 1 applicants intend to invest  a
    minimum sum of �50,000 in their proposed business enterprise.  There is
    an intense focus on the provenance  of  this  money  and  the  evidence
    required to establish its existence.  Fundamentally, the sum of �50,000
    must be "available": this is a  central  and  recurring  theme  of  the
    regime.  The second feature to which we draw attention is  that  it  is
    permissible for applicants to secure the requisite funding from,  inter
    alia, a "Venture Capital firm".

 8. At this juncture we record that a new version of paragraph  41-SD  came
    into  existence  between  the  dates  when  the   Appellants'   various
    applications were received and the dates when they were  determined  by
    the Secretary of State.  The next succeeding  version  of  Appendix  A,
    paragraph 41-SD contains (inter alia) the following provisions:


         "41-SD. The specified documents in Table 4 and  paragraph  41,  and
         associated definitions, are as follows:


         (a)  Where this paragraph refers to funding being available, unless
             stated otherwise, this means funding available to:


             (i)  the applicant;
             (ii) the entrepreneurial team, if the  applicant  is  applying
                  under the provisions in paragraph 52 of this Appendix; or
             (iii)    the applicant's business.


         (b)  Where this paragraph refers to the applicant's  business,  the
             applicant must be registered as a director of that business in
             the UK, and provide a Companies  House  document  showing  the
             address of the registered office in the UK, or head office  in
             the UK if it has no registered  office,  and  the  applicant's
             name, as it appears on the application form, as a director."


         The words highlighted  above lie at the heart of one of the  issues
         which arose at first instance and are directly related  to  one  of
         the reasons given by the FtT for dismissing the appeals.


 9. The introduction of the new paragraph 41-SD regime was effected by  the
    Statement of Changes in  Immigration  Rules  HC  628  (hereinafter  "HC
    628"), dated 06 September 2013.  Within the "Implementation" section of
    HC 628 there is a transitional provision whereby certain of the changes
    effected by HC 628 are governed by the following words:

         "...if an applicant has made an application for entry clearance  or
         leave before 01 October 2013, the application will  be  decided  in
         accordance with the Rules in force on 30 September 2013".


    This discrete provision operates in conjunction with another:


         "The other changes set out in this Statement shall take effect from
         01 October 2013".


    The "other changes" incorporate the introduction of the  new  paragraph
    41-SD regime.  The applications of all of the Appellants were  made  on
    sundry  dates  preceding  01  October  2013.   Thus  they  fell  to  be
    determined in  accordance  with  the  former  paragraph  41-SD  regime.
    However, the FtT held that the applications fell to  be  determined  in
    accordance with the new regime.  This discrete conclusion forms one  of
    the permitted grounds of appeal: see [26](xii) and [29](i) below.

10. To summarise, the paragraph 245DD regime requires  every  applicant  to
    satisfy a series of requirements which may conveniently be divided into
    four categories:

 a) Attributes, under Appendix A.


 b) English Language proficiency, under Appendix B.


 c) Financial maintenance, under Appendix C.


 d) In brief compass, a business proposal which is  genuine,  credible  and
    viable.

    The Secretary of State concluded that all of the  Appellants  satisfied
    the first three groups of requirements but did not satisfy the  fourth.
    Therein lies the genesis of these appeals.


    The Supporting Letters


11. In purported compliance with the Rules,  each  application  included  a
    letter or letters from  Profectus,  a  letter  from  Morgan  Reach,  an
    accountancy firm and a letter from Equity Chambers, signed by a  person
    described as "Barrister at Law".   Given  the  elevated  importance  of
    these letters  in  the  evidential  framework,  it  is  appropriate  to
    reproduce them in full.

12. The aforementioned letters from  Profectus  were  in  two  forms.   The
    shorter form is, in material part, in these terms:

         "Ref confirmation of entrepreneur funding


         I, Mr M Serfraz represent Profectus Venture Capital.  I confirm the
         following persons have formed an entrepreneurial team.  ...


         I confirm Profectus Venture Capital shall make available the sum of
         �50,000 to the business run by the entrepreneur team in the  United
         Kingdom".


    This letter purports to be signed by one Mr  Serfraz  (whose  role  and
    designation  we  analyse  infra)  and  the   entrepreneur   applicant/s
    concerned.


13. The longer form Profectus letter is considerably more  elaborate.  This
    example is taken from the joint Tier 1 application of Messrs Ahmed  and
    Mehmood, the second and fifth Appellants, who proposed to  establish  a
    retail fast food business known as "Chunky Chick-Inn":


         "Dear Sir/Madam,


         I Mr. M Serfraz represent  Profectus  Venture  Capital.   Profectus
         Venture Capital is a trading name of Providential  Capital  and  is
         registered with  the  FSA  under  registration  number  426749.   A
         printout from the FSA register  is  attached  herewith.   Profectus
         Venture Capital has FSA permission to  carry  out  investments  and
         operate as a venture capital firm.


         In my role as the Risk Analyst I am involved in taking decisions as
         to the feasibility of a future investment.  I have  a  duty  to  my
         fund investors to ensure that  the  investments  I  make  are  both
         viable and credible to the best of my ability.


         As part of my role I was tasked to  consider  a  business  proposal
         submitted by the following person(s)


                  Team member 1


                      (i)      Mr Aamir Ahmed...


                  Team member 2


                      (ii) Mr Javed Mehmood...


         Upon receipt of this and subject to market conditions,  having  met
         and carried out due diligence  on  the  proposed  business/business
         sector, I am pleased to confirm that the fund shall make  available
         the sum of �50,000 (Fifty thousand pounds) to the business  run  by
         Mr Aamir Ahmed and Mr Javed Mehmood ('The  Entrepreneur  Team')  in
         the United Kingdom.  Further, should there be a need for 2nd  stage
         funding round injection into the business, this will be  considered
         at the appropriate time.


         As  part  of  the  funding  conditions,  the  fund  shall  take   a
         shareholding in the company set up by The Entrepreneur Team.   This
         company shall be managed by our accountants Messrs Morgan Reach.  A
         representative of the fund shall sit  as  a  board  member  in  the
         company to ensure business decisions are taken that safeguards  the
         funds interests and develop the Company for the mutual  benefit  of
         the fund and The Entrepreneur Team.  The  fund  shall  have  a  33%
         shareholding in the business and shall hold a  preferred  class  of
         shares ('Class A shares').  I can  confirm  that  the  funds  shall
         remain available until such time that they are  transferred  on  my
         instructions   from   the   fund   into   the   business   of   The
         Entrepreneur(s).


         General  nature  of  the  business:  The  purchase  and  subsequent
         operation of 'Chunky  Chick-Inn'  franchise.   This  is  a  general
         outline and is subject to  change/amendments  according  to  market
         conditions.


         As the Risk Analyst I am satisfied that Mr Aamir Ahmed and Mr Javed
         Mehmood demonstrably have the credentials to operate this  business
         and it is for this reason that the fund is prepared to make the sum
         of �50,000 available to the business they shall operate.

    terms from Morgan Reach, an  entity  describing  itself  as  "Chartered

15. The third letter common to all of the  applications  emanated  from  an
    entity described as Equity Chambers, signed by one Y Gulraiz "Barrister
    at  Law".   While  the   terms   of   this   letter   were   materially
    indistinguishable, there were, inevitably, some variations.  The sample
    letter selected for present purposes is  again  taken  from  the  joint
    entrepreneurial application of the third and sixth Appellants:


         "REF: CONFIRMATION OF AGREEMENT


         TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN


         I hereby confirm I have witnessed the  signatures  of  Mr  Mohammed
         Serfraz acting on behalf of Profectus Venture Capital and those  of
         Mr Aamir Ahmed and Mr Javed Mehmood ('The Entrepreneur  Team').   I
         confirm the signed document dated 3rd April 2013 and  carrying  the
         reference AA/JM0403 constitutes a valid agreement  as  between  the
         parties.  I further confirm I have seen the passport identification
         of all parties to the agreement.


         Should you require any further assistance please contact me through
         my clerk at Chambers.


         Kind Regards


         Y Gulraiz LLB Law (Hons) Barrister at Law".


     As stated in the text, the author claims to have witnessed  the  making
    of the three signatures which  appear  at  the  end  of  the  Profectus
    letter.  There is no indication on the face  of  the  Profectus  letter
    that the signatures were witnessed by any third party and there  is  no
    other evidence about this exercise in any of the thirteen appeals.

    The Secretary of State's Decisions


16. The Secretary  of  State  was  persuaded  that  the  applications  were
    compliant with the first three groups  of  requirements  summarised  in
    [11] above.  However, in every  case,  the  applications  were  refused
    under (d). In short, while all of the Appellants satisfied  the  points
    scoring requirements, they failed to  achieve  the  non-points  scoring
    requirements.

17. In every case the Secretary of State's refusal decisions expressed  the
    reasons for rejection in the following terms:

         "You have applied for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a
         Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) but the Secretary of State is  not  satisfied
         that on the balance of probabilities that:


           a. You genuinely intend and are able to establish, take over  or
              become a director of one of [sic] more businesses within  the
              next six months; and


           b. You genuinely intend to invest the money referred to in Table
              4 of Appendix A in the Immigration Rules in your business  or
              businesses; and

           c. The money referred to  in  Table  4  of  Appendix  A  of  the
              Immigration Rules is genuinely  available  to  you  and  will
              remain available to you until such a time as it is  spent  by
              your business or businesses."

    This text  correlates  directly  with  the  requirements  enshrined  in
    paragraph 244 DD(h)(i)(1) & (2), (ii) and (iii).

18. The scepticism which all 13 applications generated on the part  of  the
    Secretary of State's decision making officials is  exemplified  in  the
    refusal letter in the case of Mr Zafar  (the  ninth  Appellant),  whose
    proposal was to establish a computers and IT solutions business:

         "I do not find it credible that a venture capital company with  the
         genuine intention of investing  funds  into  a  business  would  be
         persuaded by your business proposal. I therefore question what  due
         diligence Profectus have carried out before agreeing to invest  the
         �50,000 into your business idea ....


         The Profectus letter confirming funding is  dated  06  March  2013.
         This means that from the initial meeting on 01 March 2013 at  which
         you state you submitted a  business  plan  .......   Profectus  had
         approximately five days to undertake due diligence before  agreeing
         to invest �50,000 in your  business  idea  of  a  computer  and  IT
         solutions  business.   It  is  not  credible  that  sufficient  due
         diligence would have been undertaken in  such  a  short  period  of
         time."

    This Appellant's explanation that he had learned of  Profectus  from  a
    friend was also rejected as lacking  in  credibility.  It  was  further
    noted that he had not submitted  a  business  plan.   His  unconvincing
    answers  during  interview  relating  to  market  research  were   also
    highlighted.  Furthermore, his claim that he would be able  to  rent  a
    specific  business  property  was,  upon  checking,   demonstrated   as
    significantly incorrect.

19. As regards  Mr  Arshad  (the  first   Appellant),  the  decision  maker
    highlighted a series of replies made  during interview, namely that the
    Profectus funding of �50,000 was  not  a  loan;  Profectus  was  a  33%
    shareholder in the business; they are  "the  shareholders";  "contracts
    were signed"; the funding was conditional upon the Tier  1  visa  being
    secured; the Morgan Reach accountancy firm  introduced  this  Appellant
    and  his  partner  to  Profectus;  the  Tier  1  application  was   not
    accompanied by any  business  plan;  and  while  a  business  plan  was
    submitted subsequently, it was identical  to  that  also  submitted  by
    another of the Appellants.  The general  refusal  reasons  advanced  in
    respect of this Appellant mirror closely those pertaining to the  other
    Appellants.

20. While each of the Secretary of State's refusal decisions was individual
    in nature, a certain pattern  is  discernible  upon  careful  scrutiny.
    Thus, in the case of Ms  Sadia  Ahmad  (the  eighth  Appellant),  whose
    proposal was to establish, in partnership  with  the  fourth  Appellant
    (Rani Gul), a hair and beauty salon, the decision states, inter alia:

         "You have submitted a letter from Profectus  .....  which  confirms
         that Profectus have agreed to  invest  �50,000  in  your  business.
         Based on the lack of  detail  and  clarity  of  your  responses  at
         interview when asked about the specific service that you  would  be
         providing as a business, I do not find it credible that  a  venture
         capital company with the genuine intention of investing funds  into
         a business would be persuaded by your business proposal  ....   You
         stated that the venture capitals [sic] had given you �50,000 ....


         You were uncertain of the name of the venture capital company  ....
         and you then state [sic] that  Profectus  will  release  the  money
         after you get the visa ....


         You were also unable to highlight all the specific dates, meetings,
         locations and people involved in this process ....


         I ....question what due diligence Profectus have carried out before
         agreeing to invest the �50,000 into your business idea ....


         If you were genuinely intending to be an entrepreneur, you would be
         able to give a specific business location for your intended venture
         ...


         Your  market  analysis  summary  does  not  include  any   specific
         information  about  market  research  in  the  Rochdale  area   for
         customers ...


         Furthermore .... you were asked what [your proposed partner's] role
         will be.  You were unable to state what your roles would be  within
         your business ... You were unable to state clearly  what  machinery
         you required, where you would purchase them and how much they would
         cost ...


         You have not provided any evidence of the knowledge and  experience
         gained to market your business."

    All of these factors were identified as  undermining  the  credibility,
    genuineness and viability of the  application.  Finally,  the  decision
    maker concluded that there was an inexplicable discrepancy between  the
    high English proficiency scores  recorded  in  this  Appellant's  TOEIC
    certificate and her English language  proficiency  demonstrated  during
    interview, prompting the further assessment that she  did  not  have  a
    sufficient command of English to run a business in the United Kingdom.

21. Messrs Ahmed and Mehmood, the second and fifth Appellants respectively,
    based  their  applications  for  leave  to  remain  on  a  proposal  to
    establish, as partners, a business with the trading name "Chunky Chick-
    Inn Limited".   The  evidence  before  the  FtT  included  a  franchise
    agreement, the parties whereto were the aforementioned entity  (on  its
    face, an incorporated company) and the two Appellants  concerned,  both
    described as franchisees.  Whereas this document, which purports to  be
    a deed  of  franchise,  contains  multiple  signatures  and  addresses,
    notably it has no dates.  The Secretary of State's refusal  letters  in
    these cases noted that Mr Gulraiz (of  Equity  Chambers  -  supra)  was
    previously a director of Profectus, until 01  February  2013.   Various
    concerns relating to the  franchise  agreement  were  detailed.   These
    included varying descriptions of the trading name and  the  absence  of
    Profectus as a franchisee, in contradiction of one of the express terms
    of the agreement.  Furthermore, the representation that the  franchisor
    was a registered company was, following due enquiry, considered  to  be
    false. The decision maker also noted,  with  evident  incredulity,  the
    assertion that whereas Profectus would be providing the entire  funding
    of �50,000, the consideration therefor would be limited to 33% of the "
      total  value  of  the  business"  calculated  following  five  years'
    trading. The proliferation of fast food  retail  outlets  in  the  area
    where these Appellants were proposing to trade was further noted.


Decision of the FtT

22. The thirteen appeals were conjoined and were  heard  together.  In  its
    decision the FtT identified the  main  documentary  evidence,  together
    with the viva voce evidence,  considered.   Two  of  the  protagonists,
    Profectus and one Mr Serfraz (who  features  prominently  in  the  pre-
    decision interviews of the Appellants),  were  not  represented.    The
    decision of the FtT contains  various  references  to  the  Appellants'
    expert witness, Mr Tunkel, who was  engaged  by  Profectus.   We  shall
    revisit this discrete issue infra.

23. We distil from the decision of the FtT the following main findings  and
    conclusions:

        i) The expert evidence relating to the structure of Profectus as  a
           Venture Capital fund and its commercial  relationship  with  the
           entity Providentia was accepted.


       ii) The "backers"/drivers of Profectus were Mr Serfraz and Mr  Aziz,
           both Pakistani nationals.


      iii) The FtT accepted the evidence about the large credit balances in
           the Pakistani bank accounts of both men. These amounted to  some
           �2.9m.  However, the Tribunal  highlighted  that  there  was  no
           evidence of funds available in the United Kingdom to support any
           of the proposed business ventures.


       iv) Specifically, at [98]:

                "So far as the Appellants are concerned, the funds  have  to
                be in cash and either held in  a  United  Kingdom  regulated
                financial institution or transferable to the United Kingdom.
                There was no evidence of other funds at the  relevant  times
                held by or immediately available to Profectus."

        v) The total number of appeals involving Profectus was around  140.
           The FtT found:


                "There was no  evidence  to  show  that  if  many  of  these
                proposed investments proceeded that (sic) Profectus would be
                in a position to advance the funds from cash resources."


           This would require a total sum  of  around  �7  million  (140  x
           �50,000).


       vi) There was no oral testimony from Mr Serfraz and his two  witness
           statements (dated 15 July  2014  and  27  September  2014)  were
           "general in their expression and vague  and  lacking  in  detail
           ....... [and] ... do  not  attempt  to  address  the  individual
           circumstances of any of the principal Appellants."


      vii) There was a "dearth of  documentary  evidence  relating  to  the
           offers made by Profectus to the principal Appellants" and, apart
           from assertions about telephone contact and initial meetings:

                "....  there  was  no  evidence  before  the   Tribunal   of
                Profectus'  involvement  with  the  individual   Appellants'
                business proposals."

     viii) The Profectus letters of offer were "lacking in  the  terms  and
           conditions which one would have expected to see in  an  investor
           agreement".


       ix) There was no shareholders' agreement.

        x) There was no accountancy evidence relating to Profectus  of  the
           kind the Tribunal would expect to have received.

       xi)  On  the  whole,  the  evidence  relating  to  the  ability  and
           willingness of the Profectus to make  the  asserted  investments
           was "unsatisfactory" and "insufficient", deserving  of  no  more
           than "little weight".

      xii) As all of the Profectus written offers of funding were  directed
           to the businesses, rather than  the  individual  or  partnership
           entrepreneurs, they fell within paragraph 41 - SD of Appendix A,
           with the result that the  requirements  of  subparagraph  (b)  -
           requiring that the business be a company  and  the  applicant  a
           registered director, coupled with the provision of  a  Companies
           House document in specified  terms  -  were  applicable.   These
           requirements were not satisfied by any of the Appellants.

     xiii) The FtT construed the Rules thus:

                "We therefore accept the Respondent's argument that an offer
                of funding to a business which does not yet exist  does  not
                satisfy the requirements of the Rules. We find that this  is
                fatal to all the appeals before us, irrespective of all  the
                other grounds on which we find the appeals fail."

      xiv) This was followed by the omnibus conclusion:


                "We take into account the little evidence about  the  offers
                said to have  been  made  by  Profectus  to  which  we  have
                referred  above  and  the  extensive   adverse   credibility
                findings against each of the principal  Appellants  detailed
                with reasons below.  We have come to the conclusion that the
                Respondent has established  sufficient  precedent  facts  to
                transfer the burden of proof to the principal Appellants  on
                the issue of the genuineness  of  the  funding  said  to  be
                offered by Profectus.  Looking at the evidence in the  round
                and taking into account the  adverse  findings  against  the
                principal Appellants and the lack of evidence  from  or  for
                Profectus, we are satisfied that  the  funding  offers  from
                Profectus are not genuine and that  the  businesses  of  the
                principal Appellants into which  Profectus  is  said  to  be
                ready to invest are not genuine or not  viable  propositions
                for the principal Appellants on the basis described in their
                evidence.  The consequence is that each of  the  appeals  is
                dismissed under both the funding limb as  regards  Profectus
                and the viability limb as regards the business  proposal  of
                each of the principal Appellants."


24. The structure of the FtT's decision was to deal firstly with issues  of
    a general nature, common to all of the appeals. In the remainder of its
    decision the FtT dismissed the Appellants' appeals under  the  separate
    heading of Article 8 ECHR and then engaged in an exercise  of  applying
    each of its general findings and  conclusions  to  the  six  individual
    groups of Appellants.


Permission to Appeal

25. The decision of the FtT was followed by a wide ranging application  for
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal.  At  a  preliminary  hearing  we
    raised the issue of the content and scope of the grant of permission to
    appeal, which we did not find easy to construe.  Having considered  the
    oral submissions of Counsel, we gave  both  sides  the  opportunity  to
    provide  written  submissions.   These  were  duly  provided   and   we
    considered the same in conjunction with the application for  permission
    to appeal and the grant of such permission.  Its meaning and scope  are
    clearly a question - one of law - for this Tribunal to determine.


26. When the hearing of the appeals was reconvened,  in  the  wake  of  the
    preliminary hearing, we pronounced  in  advance  our  ruling  that  the
    permitted grounds of appeal are the following:

        i) Arguable error  of  law  in  holding  that  paragraph  41-SD  of
           Appendix A of the Immigration Rules in force on the dates of the
           Secretary of State's impugned decisions were applicable.

       ii) Arguable misdirection in law in its approach  to  the  issue  of
           burden of proof.

      iii) Arguable perversity in the finding that the Profectus offers  of
           funding were not genuine, having regard to the evidence that the
           necessary funds would be drawn down or paid in tranches.

       iv) Arguable error of law in failing "to apply  the  Rules  as  they
           apply to venture capital firms".

    It was common case that grounds (iii) and (iv) merge substantially.


First ground: the applicable Immigration Rules issue

27. The analysis in [10] above was not, correctly in our view, contested by
    Ms Rowlands on behalf of the Secretary of State.  The FtT proceeded  on
    the basis that the "new" version  of  paragraph  41-SD  of  Appendix  A
    applied to the Appellants' applications to the Secretary of State.  The
    FtT noted the argument on behalf of the Secretary of State that none of
    the Appellants satisfied the "company directors" requirement  enshrined
    in the new version of paragraph 41-SD(b), coupled with  the  contention
    that this was "fatal  to  all  these  appeals":  see  [115].   The  FtT
    concluded:

         "We therefore accept the Respondent's argument  that  an  offer  of
         funding to a business which does not yet exist does not satisfy the
         requirements of the Rules.  We find that this is fatal to  all  the
         appeals before us, irrespective of all the other grounds  on  which
         we find the appeals fail".


    For the reasons which we have given in [10] above  this  conclusion  is
    unsustainable in law, having regard to the transitional provisions.  Ms
    Rowlands, on behalf of the Secretary of State, did  not  argue  to  the
    contrary.

28. The crucial question, therefore, is whether this constitutes a material
    error of law.  We are impelled to the conclusion that it is  not.   Our
    reason for thus concluding is that the decision of the FtT,  considered
    as a whole,  discloses  an  abundance  of  other  tenable  grounds  for
    dismissing the appeals.  This is clear from the r�sum� in  [24]  above.
    Thus the avoidance of this error of law would have made  no  difference
    to the  outcome.   In  our  judgment  the  FtT  would  inevitably  have
    dismissed the appeals for all the other reasons expressed.  It  follows
    that no material error of law is established.



Second Ground: The Burden of Proof Issue

29. Some four months before the commencement of  the  appeal  hearings  the
    FtT, sensibly, conducted a case management review.  This  was  followed
    by formal case management  directions,  which  included  the  following
    discrete provision:

         "The nature of the Respondent's  allegations  (akin  to  deceit  or
         fraud) in relation to the VCF and Appellants is such as to place  a
         burden of proof on the Respondent.  This is  without  prejudice  to
         the obligation  of  the  Appellants  to  address  the  Respondent's
         concerns about the VCF".


    At the outset of its decision the FtT said the following:


         "9.  The standard of proof is the civil standard; that is,  on  the
             balance of probabilities.  The  burden  of  proof  is  on  the
             Appellant.  The Respondent has in  each  case  challenged  the
             genuineness  and  viability  of  the   principal   Appellant's
             business and the  funding  arrangements  with  Profectus.   In
             respect of these allegations the burden is on  the  Respondent
             to establish the precedent facts to support  such  allegations
             whereupon the burden shifts to the Appellant".


    In a later passage, the FtT stated:


         "We take into account the little evidence about the offers said  to
         have been made by Profectus to which we have referred above and the
         extensive  adverse  credibility  findings  against  each   of   the
         principal Appellants detailed with reasons below.  We have come  to
         the conclusion  that  the  Respondent  has  established  sufficient
         precedent facts to transfer the burden of proof  to  the  principal
         Appellants on the issue of the genuineness of the funding  said  to
         be offered by Profectus.  Looking at the evidence in the round  and
         taking into account the  adverse  findings  against  the  principal
         Appellants and the lack of evidence from or for  Profectus  we  are
         satisfied that the funding offers from Profectus  are  not  genuine
         and that the businesses of  the  principal  Appellants  into  which
         Profectus is said to be ready to invest  are  not  genuine  or  not
         viable propositions for  the  principal  Appellants  on  the  basis
         described in their evidence.  The consequence is that each  of  the
         appeals is  dismissed  under  both  the  funding  limb  as  regards
         Profectus and the viability limb as regards the  business  proposal
         of each of the principal Appellants".

30. In the submissions of  Mr  Jafferji  (of  counsel)  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants,  the  essential  complaint  made  was  that  the   approach
    formulated in the decision of the FtT differed from that promulgated in
    its earlier ruling.  It was submitted that the FtT decided  the  appeal
    on "an entirely different basis".   The  Appellants  complain,  per  Mr
    Jafferji's skeleton argument:

         "The Appellants' appeals would have been prepared on the basis that
         the Respondent  bore  the  burden  of  proof  with  regard  to  the
         allegation of fraud.  The FtT determined the appeal on the entirely
         different basis that the  Respondent  simply  bore  the  burden  of
         establishing precedent facts, with the burden then shifting to  the
         Appellants.  The FtT did not set out the precedent facts  that  the
         Respondent had to  establish  and  has  provided  no  reasoning  in
         relation  to  its  finding  and  no  finding  as   to   the   facts
         established".


    On behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Ms  Rowlands  countered  this
    argument by  contending  that,  at  its  zenith,  this  aspect  of  the
    Appellants' challenge must fail for the reason that  even  if  the  FtT
    erred in law  on  this  discrete  issue,  its  approach  was  the  most
    favourable conceivable to the Appellants.


31. At the hearing we suggested that in the text of the impugned  decisions
    the Secretary of State did not take her stand on fraud or any vitiating
    factor of a kindred nature.  We further suggested that fraud  does  not
    feature in the regime of the  Immigration  Rules  under  consideration.
    Neither counsel dissented from either proposition.  We acknowledge,  of
    course, that in principle, fraud or something kindred could  form  part
    of a sustainable refusal decision.  However, in these cases it did not,
    either explicitly or implicitly, form part of the Secretary of  State's
    decisions.

32. It follows that the FtT erred in law in adopting the approach expressed
    in the case management direction.  However, this error of law does not,
    without more, vitiate the FtT's decision.  In order to  decide  whether
    it does have this effect it is necessary to outline the legal framework
    pertaining to the FtT's approach.  This is  summarised  in  the  recent
    decision of this Tribunal in Muhandiramge  (section  S-LTR.1.7)  [2015]
    UKUT 675 (IAC), at [10]:

         "10. One of the more recent reported decisions  belonging  to  this
             stable is that of Shen  (Paper  Appeals:  Proving  Dishonesty)
             [2014] UKUT 236 (IAC).  This decision is illustrative  of  the
             moderately complex exercise required of tribunals from time to
             time.   Here  the  Upper  Tribunal  held,  in   harmony   with
             established principle, that in certain contexts the evidential
             pendulum swings three times and in three different directions:




             (a)  First, where the  Secretary  of  State  alleges  that  an
                  applicant has practised  dishonesty  or  deception  in  an
                  application for leave to remain, there  is  an  evidential
                  burden on the Secretary  of  State.   This  requires  that
                  sufficient evidence be adduced to raise an issue as to the
                  existence  or  non-existence  of  a  fact  in  issue:  for
                  example, by producing the completed application  which  is
                  prima facie deceitful in some material fashion.


             (b)  The spotlight thereby switches to the  applicant.  If  he
                  discharges the burden - again,  an  evidential  one  -  of
                  raising an innocent explanation, namely an  account  which
                  satisfies the minimum level  of  plausibility,  a  further
                  transfer of the burden of proof occurs.


              (c)   Where  (b)  is  satisfied,  the  burden  rests  on  the
                  Secretary  of  State  to  establish,  on  the  balance  of
                  probabilities, that the Appellant's prima  facie  innocent
                  explanation is to be rejected.


             A veritable burden of proof boomerang!"


33. In its decision the FtT employed the terminology "precedent facts"  and
    made an explicit finding that the Secretary of State had discharged the
    burden of establishing such facts sufficient to transfer the burden  of
    proof to the Appellants.  Juxtaposing the substance  of  what  the  FtT
    said in the two passages under scrutiny with the legal framework quoted
    above, we are satisfied that no error  of  law  is  demonstrated.   The
    effect of the FtT's approach was to impose a mere evidential burden  on
    the Appellants, while subjecting the Secretary of State  to  the  legal
    burden.  The correct approach would have involved  imposing  the  legal
    burden on the Appellants to demonstrate that the  requirements  of  the
    Rules had been met.  Thus, while we have held that the  FtT's  starting
    point was erroneous, we consider that this operated to the advantage of
    the Appellants and Mr Jafferji  did  not  argue  to  the  contrary.  It
    follows that the flawed starting point was not a material error of law.

34. While we  have  focused  above  mainly  on  the  question  of  material
    misdirection in law and have held that there was none,  we  nonetheless
    address the gravamen of this ground. It  is,  in  substance,  that  the
    Appellants were wrong-footed by the pre-hearing ruling, to  the  extent
    that they did not arm themselves fully  for  the  substantive  hearing.
    Having explored the  prosaic  realities  of  this  submission  with  Mr
    Jafferji, we are  satisfied  that  it  is  devoid  of  merit,  for  two
    fundamental reasons.  First, it was abundantly clear to the  Appellants
    from the pre-hearing ruling that they  should  have  come  prepared  to
    discharge a burden, an evidential one.  There was no suggestion  (quite
    properly,  given  the  factor   of   legal   representation)   of   any
    misunderstanding in this respect.  Second, though invited to do so,  Mr
    Jafferji was unable to point  realistically  to  any  further  evidence
    which the Appellants might have adduced. In particular, his  submission
    that the Appellants might otherwise have sought to adduce evidence from
    Mr Aziz (identified in [24] above) was speculative, faint and  fragile,
    wholly devoid of any evidential foundation.

35. To summarise, we conclude that the correct approach in law is  that  it
    was incumbent upon the Appellants to establish that they satisfied  all
    of the relevant requirements of the Rules, in particular those relating
    to the refusal reasons.  The FtT should have adopted this  approach  to
    burden of proof.  It failed to do so.  However, for the reasons  given,
    we are satisfied that this did not result in any material error of law.


Third and fourth grounds of appeal: venture capital funding, perversity  and
the Immigration Rules

36. Our assessment that these two grounds of appeal effectively  merge  was
    accepted by the parties'  representatives.    Mr  Jafferji,  developing
    these grounds, attacked the FtT's finding that  the  Profectus  funding
    offers were not bona fide simply because the evidence established  that
    the company had only a fraction of the total  cash  funds  required  to
    finance 140 business proposals.  The gravamen of this argument was that
    the FtT fundamentally failed to grasp the  essential  elements  of  how
    venture capital funding operates in the business  world.   The  central
    issue ventilated in promoting these grounds  of  appeal  concerned  the
    availability of the necessary finance.  Mr  Jafferji  argued  that  the
    "expert" evidence of Mr Tunkel  was  undisputed.   He  pointed  to  the
    specific finding of the FtT that  Mr  Tunkel  was  "a  reliable  expert
    witness".  He argued that the FtT  failed  to  properly  comprehend  Mr
    Tunkel's evidence that it is not normal for the totality of the funding
    required for investment to be  provided  by  the  investors  fully  and
    simultaneously.   Mr  Jafferji  further  attacked  the  FtT's  discrete
    finding that Profectus had not actually made any  financial  investment
    in any of the business proposals involving  the  140  appellants.   The
    gist of this argument was where venture capital funding is  the  source
    of the financial investment required by the Rules, there is no industry
    standard to the  effect  that  the  money  promised  must  be  actually
    available at the time when the promise of funding is made.

37. The related, though (in our view) free standing, submission  on  behalf
    of the Appellants was  that  the  Rules  do  not  require  the  funding
    promised by the venture capital investor/s to be available at the  time
    when the promise of funding is made.

38. On behalf of the  Secretary  of  State,  Ms  Rowlands  highlighted  the
    elevated and exacting nature of perversity as a ground of appeal.   She
    submitted that there was nothing perverse about the FtT  findings  that
    the Appellants were not genuine entrepreneurial applicants or that  the
    Profectus offers of funding were not genuine. Ms  Rowlands  submissions
    made clear that the Secretary of State,  as  well  as  the  Appellants,
    relied on the evidence of Mr Tunkel.  Thus it was common case that,  as
    a venture capital undertaking, Profectus was "properly  structured  and
    regulated".   Ms  Rowlands'  submissions  described  Mr  Tunkel  as  "a
    patently honest and knowledgeable witness".   She  contended  that  his
    evidence inflicted irreparable damage on the Appellants'  cases.   This
    submission was based on his evidence  of  the  kind  of  due  diligence
    exercises and the staged payments approach which, it was contended, was
    wholly lacking in the Profectus funding offers and arrangements.

39. On the discrete  issue  of  compliance  with  the  Rules,  Ms  Rowlands
    submitted that the requirements of the Rules are that the funds be made
    available in the United Kingdom, not in land situated in Pakistan; that
    the funds be immediately available to each Tier 1 applicant  -  not  in
    staged payments and not contingent on the grant of immigration  status;
    and that each applicant genuinely intends to invest the monies  in  the
    business put forward in the Tier 1 application.  Ms Rowlands  submitted
    that the  requirement  of  immediate  availability  was  not  satisfied
    because the liquid assets at the disposal of Profectus fell  measurably
    short of what was required to honour all of its funding promises  (�2.9
    million versus �7 million) and each promise of funding  was  contingent
    upon the grant of immigration status to each of the Tier 1  applicants.



40. Finally, Ms Rowlands submitted that the shortcomings  and  deficiencies
    highlighted immediately above were not overcome by the FtT's assessment
    that Profectus is a properly established venture capital entity.  This,
    she argued, is no answer to the contention that the Profectus offers of
    funding were manifestly not genuine.  Ms Rowlands  further  argued,  in
    this context,  that  while  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  entity
    described as Providentia was "regulating" Profectus  (as  claimed)  the
    FtT's evident acceptance  of  this  assertion  availed  the  Appellants
    little.

41. As this summary of the parties'  rival  contentions  demonstrates,  the
    third and fourth grounds of  appeal  raise  two  inter-related  issues.
    First, what are the requirements of the Rules in cases where a  Tier  1
    leave to remain application relies upon funding from a venture  capital
    source?  Second, is there any demonstrable perversity in  the  findings
    of the FtT bearing on this issue?

42. As our summary in  [11]  above  of  the  four  discrete  categories  of
    requirements  imposed  by  the  Rules  demonstrates,  the  first  three
    categories, or groups, differ sharply from the fourth. The first  three
    categories embody a series of requirements  which  are  mechanistic  in
    nature.  They are of the bright  line  variety.   As  we  have  already
    noted, these requirements were considered to have been satisfied by all
    of the Appellants.

43. We consider the fourth category - which, reduced to its core,  requires
    a genuine, credible, properly funded and viable business proposal -  to
    be of a quite different species.  The question of whether this discrete
    set of requirements is satisfied in any given case is not  answered  by
    the conduct of a mechanistic exercise. Rather, it  requires  evaluative
    judgment and intuition on the part of the decision  maker.  The  reason
    for this is that the characteristics of  genuineness,  credibility  and
    viability are not regulated  by  a  comprehensive,  prescriptive  code.
    This has the consequence that the legality of  every  decision  maker's
    assessment of these factors is to be adjudged by reference to the  well
    established public law standards of taking into  account  all  material
    evidence and factors; disregarding everything immaterial; and  avoiding
    descent into the Wednesbury abyss by lapsing  into  irrationality.   In
    these  appeals  the  public  law  misdemeanour  in  play  is  that   of
    irrationality. This is common case.

44. Under the Rules, the minimum funding - of �50,000 - can, in  principle,
    be provided by a venture capital source. This is explicitly  recognised
    in paragraph 41-SD (iii).  This subparagraph stipulates that, in such a
    case, an accountant's letter complying with a series of requirements is
    necessary.  Fundamentally, this letter must confirm the amount of money
    "made available".  This central requirement  is  repeated.  There  must
    also be an "original declaration" containing:

         ".... confirmation  of  whether  this  body  is  regulated  by  the
         Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") and is listed as  permitted  to
         operate as a Venture Capital Firm."


    The requisite declaration must also embody:

         ".... confirmation that the money will remain available until  such
         time as it is transferred to  the  applicant,  the  entrepreneurial
         team or the applicant's business."

    The third major requirement is the provision of a letter from a  "legal
    representative" confirming the validity of the signatures on  any  such
    declaration and that the same  "...  contains  the  signatures  of  the
    people stated".  This letter must  also  comply  with  other  specified
    requirements.

45. All of the aforementioned requirements are arranged in paragraph  41-SD
    of Appendix A.  Under the scheme of the Rules these have the  character
    of so-called "Attributes".  As appears from the text reproduced in  [7]
    above, paragraph 245DD of the Rules operates in tandem  with  paragraph
    41-SD of Appendix A.  By paragraph 245DD the Secretary of State must be
    satisfied about the five matters listed in (h).  Reduced to their core,
    these requirements are twofold.  First, the  applicant  must  genuinely
    intend and be able to establish the  business  in  question,  genuinely
    intending  to  invest  the  requisite  monies  therein.   Second,   the
    requisite monies must be  genuinely  available  to  the  applicant  and
    remain available to him until expended for the purposes of the proposed
    business. The availability of the requisite  money  to  invest  in  the
    proposed business, �50,000, is a constant and recurring  theme  of  the
    regime.

46. Paragraph 245DD (i) of the Rules equips the  Secretary  of  State  with
    certain tools, or touchstones,  to  facilitate  the  formation  of  the
    evaluative judgment required.  In the context  of  these  appeals,  the
    most significant of these are the  viability  and  credibility  of  the
    proposed business funding and the  viability  and  credibility  of  the
    applicant's business plan and market research into the chosen  business
    sector.  Paragraph 245DD (i) has  two  notable  features.   First,  the
    language ("may take into account the following  factors")  makes  clear
    that the Secretary of State is not obliged to take into account all  or
    any of the contents of the list which follows.  The second is that  the
    Secretary of State is empowered to take into account  other  facts  and
    considerations.  This  would,  of  course,  be  subject  to  the   well
    established legal constraint that any  other  facts  or  considerations
    weighed must be material. Thus, to  take  an  example,  if  there  were
    evidence that the  Secretary  of  State  had  taken  into  account  the
    applicant's ethnicity or creed  this  would  be  likely  to  vitiate  a
    refusal decision.

47. We turn our attention to one discrete issue of law.   This  relates  to
    the word "available" in the various provisions of the  Rules  rehearsed
    above.  The language of the Rules,  in  this  respect,  is,  variously,
    "available ....genuinely available ... made available ...."   The  word
    "available" is an unpretentious member  of  the  English  language.  It
    carries no technical or  special  meaning  in  this  context.   In  our
    judgment, it denotes that in the case of  every  Tier  1  applicant  or
    partnership the requisite  sum,  �50,000,  must  be  capable  of  being
    provided for the purpose of investment in the  proposed  business  upon
    the grant of the Tier 1 visa.  The Rules clearly contemplate  that  the
    grant of such visa will be the impetus for  establishing  the  business
    and beginning to operate it.  The Rules do not  address  the  issue  of
    delay between these two events. We accept that, in the real world, some
    delay will normally eventuate.  However, it is clearly implicit in  the
    Rules that this will be  of  very  short  dimensions.   Based  on  this
    analysis, we consider that �50,000 is "available" only if this  sum  is
    capable of being invested in the business within a short period of  the
    grant of a Tier 1 visa.   Cases  where  this  cannot  be  effected  are
    antithetical to the clear thrust and philosophy of the Rules.

48. Having analysed the main requirements of the Rules in this way, we turn
    to  examine  the  main  evidence  adduced  at  first  instance  by  the
    Appellants. This has one particular feature which we  would  highlight.
    Mr Tunkel was accepted by the FtT as an expert witness.  In his  report
    he  describes  himself  as  a  practising  solicitor  "specialising  in
    regulatory financial services and investment funds law" and  a  partner
    in  a  LLP  authorised  and  regulated  by  the  Solicitors  Regulation
    Authority.  It is trite that any person who  claims  to  be  an  expert
    witness in any form of litigation must be  demonstrably  objective  and
    independent.  Mr Tunkel, in his report, discloses that he was "retained
    by" Profectus, whom he describes as a "client".   Having  examined  the
    evolution of the proceedings and the background to the  first  instance
    hearing, it is apparent that the  FtT  conducted  no  enquiry  into  Mr
    Tunkel's objectivity and independence.  This is  the  first  matter  of
    concern which we have identified.

49. The second matter of concern is that there  was  no  enquiry  into  the
    expert qualifications and credentials of Mr Tunkel.  Having  regard  to
    the Secretary of State's reasons for refusing all 140 applications  and
    the centrality of the role of Profectus in all  such  applications,  we
    consider that these three factors are, collectively, a matter  of  some
    concern. In highlighting them we do not wish to be unfairly critical of
    the FtT.  Our review of the progress and  conduct  of  the  appeals  at
    first instance conveys the clear impression that something  of  a  tide
    developed  and  carried  everyone  concerned,  including  the  parties'
    representatives. However, we consider that this issue should have  been
    probed. Furthermore, Mr Tunkel's second report was  non-compliant  with
    the standard expert report  requirements,  omitting  any  statement  of
    truth in particular. We take this opportunity to highlight the need for
    caution and vigorous enquiry in relation to expert witnesses  in  every
    case.  See, in this respect, this Tribunal's recent decision in  MST  v
    Secretary of State fro the Home Department [2016] UKUT (IAC), at [68] -
    [69] especially.

50. Notwithstanding the reservations  expressed  above,  we  shall  assume,
    without   deciding,   that   Mr   Tunkel   possessed   the    essential
    characteristics of independence, objectivity and expertise in the field
    in question.  In doing  so  we  are  influenced  by,  inter  alia,  the
    consideration that all parties to this appeal relied on his evidence at
    first instance and continued to do so, evidently because  all  consider
    it supportive of his or her case. Our concerns about his  evidence  are
    developed below.

51. It is convenient to note firstly the evidence contained in the  witness
    statements of Mr Serfraz, who is represented to be one of the co-owners
    of Profectus (with Mr Aziz).  Mr Serfraz states  that  Profectus  is  a
    venture capital firm operating  "under  the  umbrella  of"  Providentia
    Capital "as a trading name". He describes himself as a "risk analyst to
    the fund" who is "able to take decisions  on  behalf  of  investors  to
    [sic] the fund".  He claims that all applicants  were  interviewed  and
    signed the "funding document". He asserts  that  "typically"  he  would
    have two or three meetings with an applicant before  making  a  funding
    decision.  He suggests that the mechanics of the arrangement  are  that
    Profectus will have a 33% share holding in the business via a preferred
    class of shares ("Class A shares") and will "exit"  the  business  upon
    the expiry of five years.  His first statement continues:

         "I can confirm that the funds shall  remain  available  until  such
         time that they are transferred on my  instructions  from  the  fund
         into the business of the entrepreneur(s)."

52. Mr  Serfraz  made  a  second  witness  statement.   This  contains  the
    following claim:

         "The fund [ie Profectus] was attracted to funding these  businesses
         as the investment required was so small and  return  on  investment
         very attractive."

    Continuing, he states that scrutiny would have been "much  greater"  if
    the investment amounts involved had been considerably  larger  and  the
    number of proposed businesses smaller. His statement continues:


         "It was never envisaged that in each case �50,000 would be invested
         in one go. In many cases funding will be drip fed in line with  the
         requirements of the business and based on milestones reached.  This
         will correspond with the delivery of the results  by  the  business
         and by making micro investments the fund will be able  to  mitigate
         its risk. The fund is in a very attractive position, given the very
         small total investment subdivided by  small  payments,  matched  by
         applicant's agreed milestones."

     Mr Serfraz then states:


         "It would be reckless to proceed to funding  without  vigorous  due
         diligence ....  It is [sic] beggars belief  that  the  Home  Office
         have assumed that funding was provided without  the  necessary  due
         diligence ....


         Each applicant was subject to a  robust  due  diligence  check  and
         assessed  against  the  micro  and  macro  economics   within   the
         parameters of the ten step investment process."

    In the same passage Mr Serfraz repeats the illustration of a �7 million
    investment  in  a  proposed  renewable   energy   business   operation,
    highlighting that this would attract quite different and more intensive
    due diligence checks. Finally, in response to the question  whether  it
    would be normal in a venture capital context to  offer  funding  to  an
    entrepreneur making little or no investment in the  proposed  business,
    Mr Serfraz states:


         "The  entrepreneurs  are  indeed  investing  in  their   respective
         businesses, it is accepted that some may be investing more  capital
         than others however  all  entrepreneurs  are  investing  through  a
         variety  of  ways;  capital  investment  in   tranches   based   on
         performance, remuneration is also paid in lieu. There is  also  the
         investment of man labour hours in operating the business  which  is
         an investment in the business itself."

53.  Mr Serfraz's witness statements  singularly  and  strikingly  fail  to
    contain any  particulars  of  the  due  diligence  exercises  allegedly
    carried out by him, on behalf of Profectus, or otherwise, in respect of
    any of the proposed businesses.   Second,  his  statements  contain  no
    particulars of  any  of  the  multiple  interviews  of  the  applicants
    allegedly  carried  out  by  him.    Third,  his   statements   contain
    manifestly contradictory assertions relating to the depth  of  the  due
    diligence allegedly carried  out.  Fourth,  while  he  claims  to  have
    received extensive documentary evidence of the applicants' "educational
    and commercial experience both here and in their native countries [and]
    ....reference letters from previous  employers  and  CVs  demonstrating
    their experience", none of this is produced or illuminated.

54. Furthermore Mr Serfraz's description of the franchise  agreement  noted
    in [22] above as "unsigned" is fundamentally inaccurate: this  document
    is replete with signatures.  This is an egregious error.  In  addition,
    he attempts no explanation of how Profectus might become a party to any
    franchise agreement.  Finally, his attempt to deal  with  the  lack  of
    financial investment by the applicants in the  proposed  businesses  is
    demonstrably evasive and inadequate.


55.  The wholly unsatisfactory nature of the evidence of Mr Serfraz in  his
    witness  statements,  objectively   demonstrated   by   unsophisticated
    analysis, is compounded by a third  evidential  contribution  which  he
    purported to make.  Unsolicited, Mr Serfraz corresponded with  the  FtT
    by a detailed email dated 16 July 2014 compiled in the wake of  a  case
    management review hearing.  This communication  invites  the  following
    observations:


 a) This communication purported to attach "the most up-to-date  investment
    management and in force agreement between Providentia  and  Profectus":
    this did not feature  in  the  evidence  before  us  and  the  supposed
    predecessor agreement is not mentioned.


 b) Mr Serfraz, in terms  which  do  not  lack  prolixity  or  obfuscation,
    appears to say that the "fund" has no money, a fact which he  seeks  to
    explain expansively.


 c) He confirms that the "fund" has only two investors viz Mr Asad Aziz and
    him, both using "our own capital".


 d) Mr Serfraz attaches an "asset report" which "...was provided by  me  to
    Providentia in the format that Providentia required".  These words  are
    frankly meaningless, serving only to  obscure  still  further  who  the
    owners and operators of Providentia were.   Furthermore,  the  document
    attached does not fit the description given: it is, rather, a statement
    of assets relating exclusively to  Mr  Aziz,  prepared  by  a  firm  of
    Pakistani accountants (ex facie) and bearing the date 31 January  2013.
    Mr Serfraz suggests that this was sent to  the  FCA  "in  around  April
    2013" in response to a request.  There is  no  supporting  evidence  of
    these assertions.


 e) This lengthy communication is replete with other meaningless statements
    such as "this can be ascertained from Providentia", "with the agreement
    and permission of Providentia", "Providentia would let me know of  ..."
    and "under the supervision and leadership of Providentia".


 f) The terms of the asset report and statement of assets appear  to  belie
    the suggestion that documents of this kind were required  by  the  FCA.
    The  terms  of  these  documents  suggest  that  they  were   generated
    exclusively for the purpose of fortifying the Tier  1  applications  in
    which Profectus had an interest.


 g) The only person other than  Messrs.  Serfraz  and  Aziz  identified  as
    having any connection with Providentia is one Mr Gulambass  (spelt with
    one 'b' and two 's's') Lakha.  His role is entirely unparticularised.


56. Mr Lakha's name does, however, appear in a document, in which his first
    name is spelt with two 'b's' and one 's'.  This  document  is  entitled
    "To Whom It May Concern" and dated  10  July  2014  viz  four  days  in
    advance of the FtT's case  management  review  hearing.   There  is  no
    evidence of the circumstances or context in which it was generated.  At
    the end of the document, following a signature, Mr Lakha  is  described
    as "CEO and  chief  investment  officer"  of  Providentia  Capital  LLP
    ("Providentia").  The document is  silent  on  the  particulars  of  Mr
    Lakha's role.  Furthermore, it suggests that Providentia  has  been  in
    existence, "authorised and regulated", since  2005,  without  providing
    any evidence regarding previous investment  activities.  Fundamentally,
    the document is entirely silent on the issue of  actual  money  in  any
    fund.  Mr Lakha did not give evidence to the FtT.  Nor did Mr  Serfraz,
    with the result that none of the myriad  issues  identified  above  was
    probed through the customary adversarial mechanisms


57.  We  juxtapose  this  with  a  series  of  other  descriptions  of  the
    Providentia/Profectus relationship. These include, variously:


 a) That Profectus was the trading name of Providentia, per the letter from
    Morgan Reach dated 3 April 2013 and the letter from  Profectus  of  the
    same date which further claimed that Profectus was registered with  the
    FSA under registration number 426749.


 b) That Providentia was the managing member (see the letter from Mr Tunkel
    dated 22 August 2014, infra).


 c) That Providentia served as the investment  manager  of  Profectus-  see
    Providentia Capital's letter dated 10 July 2014 which also states  that
    "in order to build the commercial brand of the fund 'Profectus  Venture
    Capital' was previously listed as a trading name of Providentia on  the
    financial services register".


 d) That Profectus Venture Capital has been the trading name of Providentia
    Capital LLP since 14 September 2012 and that  prior  to  "this  period"
    Profectus Venture Capital LLP was incorporated but not  trading  -  see
    the letter from Mr Serfraz  on  the  letterhead  of  Profectus  Venture
    Capital dated 9 July 2014.


 e) On 5 May 2014 a decision was taken by Providentia Capital LLP to remove
    the name of Profectus Venture Capital as a trading name  from  the  FCA
    register - see the letter referred to in (d).  This letter also  stated
    that "... in the interests of simplicity and clarity Providentia  would
    continue to manage Profectus directly".


 f) There was an assertion of a limited liability partnership agreement  of
    1 February 2013, the parties whereto were  Profectus,  Providentia,  Mr
    Serfraz, Mr Asram and Mr Aziz, coupled with an assertion of an  earlier
    agreement of 03 September 2012 between Profectus and Providentia, which
    Mr Serfraz claimed to be still effective: see [30] of the  decision  of
    the FtT, summarising the evidence of Mr Tunkel.


 g) The FtT recorded at [34] of its decision that other  than  registration
    with the FCA, Mr Tunkel  accepted  that  Providentia  added  little  or
    nothing to the business of Profectus.


    We pause here to observe that it is unclear whether  the  FtT  accepted
    that the relationship between Profectus and Providentia was  sufficient
    to meet the regulatory requirements of the Rules. There is no  specific
    finding that either Providentia or Profectus was authorised to  operate
    as a venture capital firm.

58. We turn at this juncture to consider Mr Tunkel's two reports which,  we
    note, were provided to the FtT by Mr Serfraz.  We have noted  also  the
    letter from Mr Tunkel to Mr Serfraz. We note  further  that  Mr  Tunkel
    gave  evidence  to  the  FtT.  The   first   report   invites   certain
    observations.  First, Mr Tunkel makes  no  pretence  of  neutrality  or
    objectivity.  Rather, in unvarnished terms, he sets himself the aim  of
    demonstrating that all of the Tier 1 applications  relying  on  funding
    from Profectus -

         ".. should have been accepted by the Home Office as satisfying  the
         condition in the Immigration Rules that funding is obtained from  a
         relevant form of venture capital firm."

    Second, with one minor exception, Mr Tunkel makes no attempt to address
    the  requirements  of  the  Rules.    This   is   compounded   by   his
    misrepresentation of what the Rules require, portrayed in the following
    statement:


         "..  The applicable criterion under the Immigration Rules is  based
         upon the need for  the  applicant  to  show  that  he  has  a  firm
         commitment to funds in the requisite amount (minimum �50,000) ..."

         [Our emphasis.]

    This is not what the Rules say.  In the language of the  Rules  (as  we
    have stressed above), this discrete requirement is that  the  funds  be
    (variously) "available", "genuinely available"  and  "made  available".
    The second, related requirement is that the source of  the  funding  is
    viable and credible.  Mr Tunkel omits this from his commentary.


59. The unashamedly partisan tone  of  the  report  continues.   Mr  Tunkel
    accuses both the Home Office and unspecified Tribunals, in  unspecified
    cases, of having reached a "perverse" conclusion.   Next,  he  suggests
    that  Profectus  satisfies  the  Financial  Conduct  Authority  ("FCA")
    requirements that the manager of the venture capital fund  be  licensed
    and that the firm hold a series of "permissions" required  by  statute.
    The report purports to address  the  relationship  between  Providentia
    Capital LLP ("Providentia") and Profectus.  This  relationship,  it  is
    suggested, is governed by a LLP Agreement ("LLPA").  Objective scrutiny
    of this agreement is not possible as it is not provided. Providentia is
    described as the "Managing Member" of the LLP.   The  LLPA  confers  on
    Providentia all rights to use "Profectus" as its own trading name.  The
    immediately succeeding sentence is of note:

         "I understand that there is also an investment management agreement
         under  the  terms  of  which  Profectus'  business  is  managed  by
         Providentia".

    The inference that Mr Tunkel was neither provided  with  nor  requested
    this agreement is irresistible.  This is surprising, given  the  stated
    purpose of his report.

60. Mr Tunkel summarises certain provisions of the LLPA as follows:

 a) Providentia is both the "Managing Member" of the LLP and the  "operator
    for collective investment scheme operational purposes".

 b) Profectus is a "client" of Providentia.

 c) Providentia exercises the rights of the "Designated Members and/or  the
    LLP": Mr Tunkel  does  not  illuminate  the  reference  to  "Designated
    Members".

 d) Providentia's powers include evaluation of investments for the purposes
    of acquisition or disposal, making agreements relevant to  investments,
    executing  documents  in  relation  to   investments   and   addressing
    "outsourcing" issues.

    The terminology "the total Commitment" is also employed  in  the  LLPA.
    This, per Mr  Tunkel,  is  the  sum  of  all  "capital"  received  from
    investors who, in turn, are classified "A Members".  In  this  context,
    the following description is of note:


         "It would be common practice for a fund of this nature to accept an
         investor as a member of the fund only on having assured itself that
         such investor is clearly able to fund tranches of his Commitment on
         relatively short notice (say 10 days to 2 weeks from the date of  a
         Draw down request) and is unlikely to default."

    While Mr Tunkel observes that investors have  "other  uses"  for  their
    money until a Draw down request is made, he  avoids  entirely  the  key
    issue of the practical consequences for the fund, and those seeking  to
    rely on it, in the event of investors defaulting.


61. Mr Tunkel purports  to  analyse  the  position  of  Tier  1  applicants
    generally.  He suggests, without particulars or elaboration:

         ".... Profectus exists  chiefly  or  entirely  to  fund  successful
         applicants for  their  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Visas.   Or  it  is
         likelier that Draw downs will be conducted ad hoc."

    He does not attempt to augment or illuminate the highlighted words.  He
    continues:

         "It is not until the application is granted (or any initial request
         is overturned on appeal) that Profectus needs to  have  the  monies
         committed to it to fund the applicant."

    We construe this to signify that at all stages of the process preceding
    the grant of a Tier 1 Visa  -  consisting  of  funding  application  to
    Profectus, interview/s, analysis,  due  diligence,  funding  offer  and
    submission of the Tier 1 application to the Home Office - Profectus was
    not capable of providing the  money  promised  to  the  applicant.  The
    reason for this is that Draw down requests had not been made  of  third
    party investors.  Accordingly, the  "money"  was  purely  notional,  or
    imaginary, throughout.

62. Mr Tunkel's main report also touches on the issue of consideration  and
    scrutiny of applications for funding.  He  begins  by  noting  that  an
    applicant's criteria must meet the "investment objectives of Profectus"
    without explaining what these are. He continues:

         "We would expect to see  that  [Providentia]  had  a  discretionary
         investment management mandate ....  [in specified terms]."

    Such mandate would authorise Providentia to review  and  consider  each
    application on its intrinsic merits, to subject the  applicant  to  due
    diligence, to determine whether the application fell within  the  remit
    of the fund being managed and to make the  investment  requested.   The
    purely  abstract  terms  in  which  Mr  Tunkel  expresses  himself  are
    striking.  This theme continues through the next passage:


         "These decisions would typically be  taken  through  some  sort  of
         investment committee structure and might in relevant  circumstances
         be informed or  assisted  by  discussion  with  external  advisors.
         However, the firm would in due course be  involved  in  making  the
         decision to invest, maintaining  a  record  of  that  decision  and
         reporting  on  that  decision  and  others  like  it  in   periodic
         statements to the fund's investors."

    Mr Tunkel's failure to relate these purely abstract descriptions to the
    realities,  legal  and  otherwise,  of  the  arrangements,  powers  and
    structures of Providentia and Profectus is noteworthy.  So too  is  the
    later statement in his report where he expressly disavows any knowledge
    of the Providentia/Profectus due diligence internal procedures. Why did
    he not  proactively  seek  to  arm  himself  with  this  self-evidently
    important information?

63.  Mr  Tunkel  provided  a  supplementary  report,  which  we  have  also
    considered.  We have found  aspects  of  this  report  troubling.   For
    example,  on  the  one  hand,  Mr  Tunkel  quotes  from  the   explicit
    requirement of the Rules that venture capital firms  be  "regulated  by
    the [FCA]".  However, on the other hand, he makes no attempt to address
    the implications of Providentia, rather than Profectus, being  the  FCA
    regulated entity.  He does not address the issue of  Providentia  being
    two steps removed from all of the Tier 1 applicants.   Furthermore,  he
    fails to address the issue  of  the  Providentia/Profectus  "investment
    management agreement" mentioned in bare terms in his first report.   He
    confines himself to the vague observation that:

         "... behind all of these applications  there  is  an  FCA-regulated
         firm involved in the process."


    He  follows  this  by  an  observation  regarding  "semantics"  in  the
    provisions of the Immigration Rules.  He suggests that the "FCA  Rules"
    have -


         "... a very broad and non-prescriptive view of what venture capital
         is and how venture capital investments made by made."

    Finally, the lengthy  section  in  his  second  report  addressing  the
    freedom of  Tier  1  applicants  to  choose  their  preferred  proposed
    business is puzzling, given that this has at no time been an issue.  It
    bears all the hallmarks of a smokescreen.


64. At the FtT hearing, Mr Tunkel gave  a  sharply  contradictory  response
    about one discrete issue in cross examination.  The decision of the FtT
    records, in [36]:

         "Mr Tunkel was  aware  that  Profectus  had  been  closed  for  new
         investments since August 2013."

    This is manifestly irreconcilable with his earlier evidence on the same
    issue, which was, at [30]:


         "He had no information about the Profectus fund  now  being  closed
         but assumed that like most venture capital funds once it had raised
         sufficient to fund its proposed investments or had raised  as  much
         money as it wished, the fund would not remain open indefinitely for
         further investors".


    Furthermore, the first assertion is devoid of any supporting  evidence,
    whether in  the  form  of  documentary  evidence  or  via  the  witness
    statements of Mr Serfraz.  In  addition  the  suggested  date  of  fund
    closure - August 2013 - was crying out for  a  proper  explanation  and
    supporting evidence, taking into  account  particularly  the  elaborate
    attempts by Mr Tunkel and Mr Serfraz in their evidence to explain  why,
    in the real world of  venture  capital  funding,  Profectus/Providentia
    would not have been in a position to provide the  promised  funding  of
    �50,000 (multiplied by 140/187 applicants - both  multipliers  feature)
    at the time when the applications for the Tier 1 visas  were  made  viz
    January to April 2013.  The contradictions and discrepancies  are  many
    and manifest.


65.  Mr Tunkel also purported  to  give  evidence  about  Providentia.   He
    suggested, vaguely and without elaboration, that there were  "a  number
    of individuals working in"  Providentia  and  that  these  unidentified
    persons were "regulated".  This contrasts with his main  report,  which
    states that only Providentia is regulated.  He referred to yet  another
    agreement - an earlier LLP agreement - which he clearly  had  not  seen
    and evidently had not requested.  The following passage is noteworthy:

         "He [Mr Tunkel] had no information about  the  Profectus  fund  now
         being closed but assumed that like most venture capital funds  once
         it had raised sufficient to fund its proposed  investments  or  had
         raised as much money as it wished, the fund would not  remain  open
         indefinitely for further investors."

    It is striking that  Mr  Tunkel  had  neither  received  nor  requested
    important information of this kind and, further, was prepared  to  make
    an assumption about it.   His  assumption  was  that  the  "sufficient"
    funding, that is to say �7 million, had  been  raised.   There  was  no
    evidence whatsoever to this effect.


66. Mr Tunkel was asked about what he would expect a due diligence exercise
    to entail.  According to the  Tribunal's  decision,  his  evidence  was
    this:


         "There should be a financial report on the individuals involved  in
         the business and an analysis of any  profit  and  loss  account  or
         projected  profit  and  loss  account.  The  fund  managers   would
         concentrate on the backgrounds and strength of key individuals such
         as those who would form the board of management."

    We make the observation that no "financial  report"  or  "analysis"  of
    this kind in respect of any of the Appellants was produced.   Next,  Mr
    Tunkel declined to comment on the capacity of Mr Serfraz to manage  and
    oversee some 187 agreements with "start-up" firms during  a  compressed
    period of time.  He described Mr Serfraz as  the  "investment  advisor"
    and the "link to the Providentia investment  team".   We  can  find  no
    evidence whatever about the membership of this "team".  Mr Tunkel  knew
    nothing about  the  expertise  or  qualifications  of  Mr  Serfraz.  He
    suggested that Mr Serfraz -


         "... was not an employee of Providentia but was contracted to  them
         .... was provided by Profectus to Providentia under  the  agreement
         between  Profectus  and  Providentia  to  enable   Providentia   to
         discharge its management function to its client, Profectus."

    Strikingly, there is nothing to this effect in Mr Tunkel's main report.
     Indeed, neither Mr Serfraz nor any named person features in either  of
    this reports. Furthermore, there is no mention of  these  inter-company
    arrangements  in  either  of  Mr  Serfraz's  witness  statements.    No
    Profectus/Providentia "contract" has been produced.  Finally,  Mr  Aziz
    features nowhere in the evidence of either Mr Tunkel or Mr Serfraz.


67. We highlight one final feature of the evidence of Mr Tunkel.   The  FtT
    records the following discrete aspect of his cross examination:

         "It was put to him that the  type  of  investment  which  Profectus
         intended to make in the business of the Appellants would not  yield
         any income for at least five years."

    We interpose here the observation that the  total  investment  required
    would be �7 million if the multiplier is 140 and �9.35 million  if  the
    multiplier is 187. The FtT's  decision  records  Mr  Tunkel's  response
    thus:


         "He did not consider this in itself to be  a  matter  for  concern.
         Whether an investment produced  an  income  flow  depended  on  the
         nature of the investment and other factors."

    We find this evidence frankly bizarre.


Third and Fourth Grounds of Appeal - Our Conclusions:

68. Mr Tunkel's evidence to the FtT, in both written and oral form, was, by
    some measure, one of the  most  important  components  of  the  overall
    evidential matrix.  Furthermore, in  promoting  the  third  and  fourth
    grounds of appeal, the Appellants rely  heavily  on  it.   Mr  Tunkel's
    evidence is the cornerstone of Mr Jafferji's submission  that  the  FtT
    misunderstood, to the extent of perversity, how venture capital funding
    operates in  the  real  world  of  finance.   He  pins  his  submission
    particularly on  Mr  Tunkel's  description  of  how  "A"  Members  fund
    "tranches" of their commitment to the fund. We consider  this  evidence
    to   have   no   bearing   whatsoever   on   the   realities   of   the
    Profectus/Providentia offers of funding to the Appellants.  As we  have
    outlined extensively above, Mr Tunkel testified unequivocally that  the
    fund had been closed for some time.  Closure, in this context,  denotes
    receipt of sufficient monies to enable the requisite number of  funding
    offers to be made to applicants.  There  was  no  suggestion  that  the
    "fund" was notional or fictitious.  We can identify no misunderstanding
    of the type suggested in the FtT's decision.

69. We  add,  with  some  emphasis,  that  Mr  Tunkel's  evidence  must  be
    considered as a  whole.   We  have  undertaken  this  exercise  in  the
    detailed analysis above. In our judgment a consideration of Mr Tunkel's
    evidence as a whole leads inexorably to the conclusion that  the  third
    and fourth grounds of appeal  have  no  sustenance.   As  our  analysis
    demonstrates,  the  overall  evidential   matrix   was   riddled   with
    discrepancies  and  omissions.   In  particular,  there  were  repeated
    oblique references to documentary evidence of unmistakable  materiality
    which was not produced.  A single and pertinent  illustration  of  this
    was highlighted by the FtT in the following passage:

         "We find it remarkable  that  we  have  not  been  shown  a  single
         document to confirm that any of this investigative work was done in
         respect of any of the cases  now  before  us  ....  We  would  have
         expected to see a detailed file of documents assembled by Profectus
         on  each  of  these  cases  to  demonstrate  that  these   proposed
         businesses really were considered to be  viable  and  worthy  of  a
         genuine investment of �50,000.  There was no explanation  why  such
         documents had not been released to the Appellants to support  their
         appeals."

    See [42].  The expectation to which the FtT refers in this  passage  is
    based on a combination of pure common sense and Mr  Tunkel's  evidence.
    In short, there was not a scrap of paper either supporting or verifying
    the due diligence claims  of  Mr  Serfraz.   The  Tribunal's  resulting
    incredulity formed one of the pillars of its dismissal of the appeals.

70. In similar vein, in [103], the Tribunal noted with surprise the absence
    of "a substantial paper trail".  It considered the letters of offer  to
    be "lacking in the terms and conditions which one would  have  expected
    to see in an investor agreement".  It noted further that there was  "no
    evidence of the terms and conditions which were to be  incorporated  in
    any share holder's agreement".  It highlighted the bare assertion, with
    no supporting evidence, in the Morgan Reach letters that Profectus  had
    "made available" (past tense) �50,000 to the applicants concerned.  Nor
    had Morgan Reach made any attempt  to  relate  this  assertion  to  the
    actual assets of either Mr Serfraz  or  Mr  Aziz.   The  Tribunal  also
    considered, separately, the documentary evidence provided in an attempt
    to demonstrate that Profectus was  a  genuine,  established  investment
    vehicle: see [105] - [108].  Its conclusion was that this evidence  was
    unsatisfactory and insufficient. We find this  conclusion  unassailable
    and, in this context, we highlight the absence of any challenge  to  it
    upon the hearing of these appeals.  To this we add  that  none  of  the
    multiple gaps and question marks was filled or answered by Profectus in
    its written intervention (at the invitation of the Tribunal)  upon  the
    hearing of these appeals.

71. Fundamentally, the Secretary of State reasons for refusing all  of  the
    Appellants' applications were twofold. First, the  Secretary  of  State
    was not satisfied that there was a genuine intention to  establish  the
    business in question.  Second, the Secretary of State was not satisfied
    that the necessary monies were genuinely available,  and  would  remain
    available, to the Appellants.  The FtT, for its  part,  endorsed  these
    conclusions. In doing so, it found no error of law on the part  of  the
    Secretary of State.  The Tribunal concluded, in terms, that  there  was
    an abundance of evidence justifying these  conclusions.   We,  for  our
    part, can identify no legal flaw in the  FtT's  omnibus  conclusion  to
    this effect.  It was amply supported by a series of pertinent, rational
    and  unimpeachable  findings  relating   to   discrete   issues.    The
    proliferation of question marks,  shadows,  omissions,  inconsistencies
    and  discrepancies  which  we  have  highlighted  above  rendered  this
    conclusion inevitable.

72. We consider that, taking the evidence at its absolute zenith and in its
    most favourable light from the Appellants' perspective,  the  necessary
    �50,000 was not available to any of  them.   The  evidence  established
    that the only possible source  of  the  funding  was  a  total  sum  of
    approximately �2.8 million held in personal bank accounts of Mr Serfraz
    and   Mr   Aziz   in   Pakistan.     The    arithmetic    is    simple.
    Profectus/Providentia was not in  a  position  to  honour  the  140/187
    promises of funding of �50,000 which had been made.  It was  no  answer
    for the Appellants to argue (as they did at first instance)  that  they
    merely had to demonstrate the availability of �300,000 (i.e. �50,000  x
    6),  for  the  simple  reason  that  they  had  no  legal  entitlement,
    contractual or otherwise, to preferential treatment or precedence vis-�-
    vis the monies in the Pakistan bank accounts.  We conclude  that  these
    monies were not as a matter of law "available" to any  of  the  140/187
    applicants.

73. To this we add, as regards the separate though related  requirement  of
    the  Rules,  that  the  gaping  chasm  between  �2.8  million  and   �7
    million/�9.35 million was sufficient per se to sound the death knell on
    the issue of genuineness.  There  was,  of  course,  a  host  of  other
    factors rendering the conclusion of the Secretary of State and  FtT  on
    this discrete issue unassailable, as we have held above.

74. Finally, we reject the submission of Mr Jafferji concerning  the  ninth
    Appellant, Mr Zafar,  that a mere intention to invest only  �25,000  at
    the outset of the business venture, coupled with an intention to invest
    the balance of �25,000  at  some  unspecified  future  date  from  some
    unspecified source, satisfies the  requirements  of  the  Rules.   This
    submission is confounded  by  the  plain  and  simple  wording  of  the
    relevant  provisions.   Furthermore,  it  finds  no  sustenance  in  Mr
    Jafferji's resort to "commercial reality". The operative "reality",  in
    this context, is what the Rules dictate. In addition where,  as  in  Mr
    Zafar's case, the business proposal is a  joint  one,  based  on  equal
    funding contributions, the withdrawal of a  partner  applicant  at  any
    stage has the consequence that the remaining applicant/s must fail. The
    appeal of Mr Zafar is defeated on this free standing ground, as is that
    of Mr Nazir (the second appellant).


75. The second discrete matter which we highlight, in conclusion,  is  that
    these appeals have featured generic issues only.  The permitted grounds
    of appeal do not extend to any challenge to the  assessments,  findings
    and conclusions of the FtT in the individual appeals.

76. We conclude with the observation that, in the  interests  of  certainty
    and maximum clarity, consideration could usefully be given, if a viable
    and workable model could be found, to the introduction in the Rules  of
    some time limit or time measurement for the actual investment of monies
    calculated from the date of a positive Tier 1 decision.



Conclusion

77. On the grounds and for the reasons elaborated above, which both reflect
    and augment those of the FtT, we dismiss all  appeals  and  affirm  the
    decision of the FtT.
