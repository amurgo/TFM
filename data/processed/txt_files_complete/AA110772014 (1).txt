For the appellant:  Valerie Easty (counsel instructed by Simman)
For the respondent: Mr Steven Walker


                           DETERMINATION & REASONS

 1. This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Sue Lenier), sitting at Taylor House on 11 March, to  a
    human rights appeal by a citizen of China, born 22  October  1957.  The
    judge had first to  establish  the  right  test  for  deciding  whether
    someone like this appellant, with end-stage kidney disease,  but  whose
    condition is well met by free dialysis, so long as he remains  in  this
    country, should be required to return to  his  country  of  origin,  or
    whether in the circumstances that would amount to 'inhuman or degrading
    treatment', contrary to article 3 of the European Convention  on  Human
    Rights.

 2. These cases are never easy; but there is a good deal  of  authority  on
    the point. No doubt the leading cases on returning someone in  need  of
    life-saving medical treatment, both involving AIDS, are  D.  v.  United
    Kingdom [1997] ECHR 25 and N v United Kingdom [2008] ECHR 453, but  the
    most important decisions of the domestic courts are N  [2005]  UKHL  31
    (the decision of the House of Lords in  the  European  Court  of  Human
    Rights case), and GS (India) & others [2015] EWCA Civ 40.

 3. The judge referred to all these decisions, and more, and set out  their
    effect, but needed to reconcile the various statements of principle set
    out in them into clear guidelines to apply to the facts of the  present
    case, which is what we shall try to do now, in terms of  the  decisions
    of the House of Lords in N  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  GS,  which
    respectively considered D  and the decision of the  European  Court  of
    Human Rights in N  in a much more authoritative form than we could.

 4. First the judge, at paragraph 26, set out the test in N  as follows, at
    paragraph 26:

         "The test to be applied  was  again  considered  in  [N].  It  was,
         according to Lady Hale at paragraph 69,  "whether  the  appellant's
         illness had reached such a critical stage, (ie he is dying) that it
         would be inhuman treatment to deprive him of the care which  he  is
         currently receiving and send him home  to  an  early  death  unless
         there is care available there to enable him to meet that fate  with
         dignity". At paragraph 68, Lady Hale said "Where the illness is  at
         an advanced or terminal stage, then  conditions  in  the  receiving
         country should be crucial"."

 5. Before we go on to deal with the judge's treatment of GS,  we  need  to
    set out what Lady Hale actually said:

         "68  I have found helpful the concurring opinion of  Judge  Pettiti
             in D v United Kingdom, p 455:

                  "The inequality of medical treatment was not the criterion
                  adopted by the Court as medical equipment  in  the  Member
                  States of the United Nations is, alas, not all of the same
                  technological  standard;  the  case  of  D,  however,   is
                  concerned not with hospital treatment in general, but only
                  with the deportation of a patient in the final  stages  of
                  an incurable disease."

             As Lord Hope's analysis shows, the later cases  have  made  it
             clear that it is the patient's present medical condition which
             is the crucial factor.  The  difficulty  is  in  understanding
             where  conditions  in  the  receiving  country  fit  into  the
             analysis. Even in those cases where the illness is not  in  an
             advanced or terminal  stage,  the  Court  does  refer  to  the
             medical care and family support available there. But  it  does
             so in terms of there being  "no  prospect"  of  such  care  or
             support, rather than in  terms  of  its  being  likely  to  be
             available. It is difficult to  see,  therefore,  whether  this
             consideration adds anything in those cases. Where the  illness
             is in an advanced or terminal stage, then  conditions  in  the
             receiving country should be  crucial.  It  is  not  yet  clear
             whether the applicant has to show that  appropriate  care  and
             support during those final stages was unlikely to be available
             or whether again the "no  prospect"  test  applies.  That  was
             undoubtedly the situation in D v United Kingdom and the  Court
             has  made  it  clear   that   the   "compelling   humanitarian
             considerations" are those which arise  in  a  case  where  the
             facts come close to those in D. But if it is indeed  the  case
             that this  class  of  case  is  limited  to  those  where  the
             applicant is in the  advanced  stages  of  a  life-threatening
             illness, it would appear inhuman  to  send  him  home  to  die
             unless the conditions there will be such that  he  can  do  so
             with dignity. As the European Court said in  Pretty  v  United
             Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1, para 65, "The very  essence  of  the
             Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom."

         69. In my view, therefore, the test, in  this  sort  of  case,  is
             whether the applicant's illness has reached  such  a  critical
             stage (i.e. he is dying) that it would be inhuman treatment to
             deprive him of the care which he is  currently  receiving  and
             send him home to an early death unless there is care available
             there to enable him to meet that fate with dignity. This is to
             the same effect as the text prepared by my noble  and  learned
             friend, Lord Hope of Craighead. It sums up the facts in D.  It
             is not met on the facts of this case."

 6. We are sorry to set this all out at length, when the judge had done his
    or her[1] level best to summarize it for everyone's  benefit;  but  the
    fact is that they had left themselves with a misleading  impression  of
    what Lady Hale had actually said. As has been  seen,  the  judge  ended
    paragraph 26 by citing, with added emphasis in italics, the words  "...
    at an advanced or terminal stage,  then  conditions  in  the  receiving
    country should be crucial".   However, the judge  failed  to  refer  to
    paragraph 69 where Lady Hale herself set out the actual test,  in  very
    clear terms, beginning "... whether the applicant's illness has reached
    such a critical stage (i.e. he is dying) ...".  It is in  that  context
    that Lady Hale's reference to "advanced or terminal  stage"  is  to  be
    understood.

 7. That takes us on to GS; unlike D and N, this involved, in five  out  of
    six cases, the very same problem as  in  the  present  case,  end-stage
    kidney disease, which the Court of Appeal referred to as  'ESKD'.  This
    is what Laws LJ said, immediately after setting out the same passage as
    we have done from Lady Hale's speech in N:

         "66  These citations demonstrate that in the view of the  House  of
             Lords the D exception is confined  to  deathbed  cases.   Miss
             Lieven submitted that the focus of their Lordships'  reasoning
             (at least that of Lord Nicholls) was upon those with  AIDS,  a
             condition much more often suffered  than  ESKD;  so  that  the
             strictures in N should not be taken to  apply  to  the  latter
             class of case.  But that would  be  merely  adventitious,  and
             therefore unprincipled; and I can find nothing to  support  it
             in their Lordships' speeches.

         67. This result is all of a piece with the repeated statements  in
             the  Strasbourg  court  that  "[a]liens  who  are  subject  to
             expulsion cannot in principle claim any entitlement to  remain
             in the territory of a Contracting State in order  to  continue
             to benefit from medical, social or other forms  of  assistance
             and  services  provided  by  the  expelling  State"  (N  v  UK
             paragraph 42; cf paragraph 44, and paragraph 54 in D v UK).

         68. In my judgment none of these appellants fall within  the  kind
             of exceptional case addressed in D and N."

 8. The judge correctly summarized the effect of this decision at paragraph
    28, confining the rule to deathbed cases; but she  evidently  had  some
    difficulty in reconciling  the  mass  of  authority,  and  returned  at
    paragraph 42 to the misleading citation from Lady Hale's  paragraph  68
    in N, as we have already set it out at 4. That was what led  the  judge
    into error, since she ended that paragraph by saying

         "In my view there was a tension between the advanced stages, or the
         dying stage, that led onto but preceded the deathbed stage  of  GS.
         The appellant potentially fell within this gap."

 9. What the judge did was to introduce an  unnecessary  complication  into
    the recent straightforward test set by high authority  in  GS.  We  now
    have to consider what the result should be. The  judge  set  out  their
    conclusions at 41 (bis; there had evidently been some difficulties with
    the electronic numbering) , first on the basis of the test set  out  at
    9, and then on the additional ground that "... if he survived  removal,
    death would inevitably take place in appalling circumstances".

10. This additional reason was based on the judge's findings  at  paragraph
    40, about the appellant's prospects on return to China without  friends
    or family, or resources of his own. Those were  graphically  expressed,
    and may turn out to be justifiable in the end; but the reason we cannot
    uphold them  at  this  stage  is  that  they  are  unsupported  by  any
    background evidence about whether or not social care, as distinct  from
    medical treatment, is available free of charge in China. There may also
    be an open question as to whether the appellant's �1500 grant on return
    from the Home Office would last him  as  long  as  he  needed  for  the
    ordinary comforts of life, even if it would not pay for more than a few
    months' dialysis?

11. These questions will have to be the subject of a further hearing, which
    can very well take place before  Judge  Lenier.  Miss  Easty  was  also
    anxious to introduce evidence of other medical conditions she said  the
    appellant suffered from, though here we have to add a warning note. All
    the members of the court in GS  refused to accept leading  counsel  for
    the appellants' submission that there was any difference  in  principle
    between AIDS, the disease concerned in D and N, and ESKD. We do not see
    why there should be any difference made  between  any  disease  with  a
    likely fatal outcome and another. On the other  hand,  another  disease
    might possibly be relevant if  it  led  to  greater  distress  for  the
    appellant while dying of HKSD.
