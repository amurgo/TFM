For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath - Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Tanvir Hussain Mirza, a citizen of  Pakistan  born
    13th January 1963.  He appeals against the decision of  the  Respondent
    made on 8th July 2014 to refuse leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    as the unmarried partner of a British citizen.

 2. The Appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal was allowed
    on 18th November 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lowe.  The Secretary
    of State appealed against the decision of Judge Lowe and on 24th  March
    2015, having heard submissions I found that there was a material  error
    of law in the determination  of  Judge  Lowe  in  that  she  failed  to
    consider the evidence in the round and  to  take  account  of  relevant
    factors in assessing proportionality.   She  had   allowed  the  appeal
    under paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Immigration Rues and under Article  8
    ECHR. I set her decision aside.

 3. I now proceed to remake the decision.

 4. The Appellant's immigration history as set  out  by  the  Secretary  of
    State is as follows.    He applied for asylum on 18th December 2001 and
    his application was refused on 10th March 2004 due  to  non-compliance.
    He was served with an IS151A on 17th March 2004 and lodged an appeal on
    2nd April 2004.  His  appeal  was  dismissed  on  27th  July  2004  and
    permission to appeal was refused.  He became appeal rights exhausted on
    21st December 2004.  He lodged further submissions on 29th August  2008
    which were rejected with no right of appeal on  10th  March  2011.   He
    made an application for leave to remain as an unmarried partner on  7th
    February 2012 which was refused with no right of appeal in  June  2012.
    A reconsideration was requested on 11th  July  2012  and  the  decision
    which is the subject of this appeal was made on 8th July 2014.

 5. The Secretary of State found that the Appellant meets  the  suitability
    requirements of Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.   She  accepted
    that he meets the relationship requirements of Appendix FM on the basis
    of his relationship with Mrs Summira Hussain Mirza, a British  citizen.
    The Secretary of State did not accept that the Appellant can  meet  the
    criteria of paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM,  taking the view that  there
    are no insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant's wife   returning  to
    Pakistan with him.  He has children there.  His father  is  there.   He
    was educated there and speaks the language.  He and his  spouse  had  a
    traditional Islamic wedding on 3rd June 2010 and they   could  relocate
    to  Pakistan  together   to   continue   their   family   life   there.
    Alternatively he could return to Pakistan to apply for entry clearance.



 6. The Secretary of State went on to consider the application in terms  of
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules but found that  none  of  the
    criteria of that provision are  met.   In  particular  with  regard  to
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) the Secretary of State took into account that  the
    Appellant is now 51 years of age and  was  38  when  he  arrived  here,
    having spent his life up to that point in  Pakistan.   The  version  of
    paragraph 276ADE applicable to the Appellant's claim in  light  of  the
    date of decision is the original one:

         "(vi)    Subject to subparagraph 2,  (the  applicant)  is  aged  18
             years or above, has lived continuously in the UK for less than
             twenty years discounting any period of imprisonment but has no
             ties including social, cultural or family with the country  to
             which he would have to go if required to leave the UK."

 7.  The  Secretary  of  State  went  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
    compassionate and compelling circumstances in this case  but  concluded
    that there are none.

 8. The Secretary of State said in  the refusal letter that  the  Appellant
    entered the UK on a false passport but it was conceded by Mr Nath  that
    that is not so.

 9. I have a statement from the Appellant  dated  22nd  September  2014  in
    which he states that he came  to  the  UK  in  2001  with  valid  entry
    clearance as a visitor. He was married in Pakistan but his  wife  died.
    He has five children there all grown up.  He has not seen them for  the
    last fourteen years.  He met his current wife in 2006.  She worked in a
    restaurant owned by a friend of his.  He moved in with her in  February
    2009 and they married in 2010.  He is not working in  the  UK  but  his
    wife is.  She has parents and a brother here.

10. I have a statement from the Appellant's wife dated 17th September 2014.
     She describes  how  they  met.   They  registered  their  marriage  in
    Scotland on 23rd April 2014.  She has family in the  UK.   I  have  the
    Islamic and the Scottish marriage certificates.  I have a  letter  from
    the Appellant's GP dated 8th July 2015 confirming that he takes regular
    medication for diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol.

11. No evidence was led and I  heard submissions initially  from  Mr  Shah.
    He said that it is not the case as claimed by the  Secretary  of  State
    that the Appellant came to the UK illegally.  He entered legally.  This
    has now been  accepted  by  the  Respondent.   The  Appellant  was  not
    represented at his appeal against the refusal of  asylum.   His  appeal
    was dismissed.  He met his wife while he was awaiting a  decision  from
    the Home Office.  She is working full-time.  She is financially able to
    maintain herself and the Appellant.  She owns a house.   The  Appellant
    has adopted the British way of life.  He has some medical problems.  He
    has been disowned by his family in Pakistan.  There is no point in  him
    having to go back to Pakistan to seek entry  clearance.   He  would  be
    unable to cope without his wife in Pakistan.

12. Mr Nath submitted that the Immigration Rules exist for a  reason.   The
    Appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Rules.  The meat of  this
    case is the issue of whether there are insurmountable  obstacles.   The
    Appellant's leave was precarious for some time.  He said he would  rely
    on SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ 387 (23 April 2015) and  Dube  (ss.117A  to
    117D) [2015] UKUT 90.  There are no compassionate circumstances in this
    case.  It is not unreasonable that the Appellant  be expected to return
    to Pakistan to make an application for entry clearance.  He relied  too
    on Asif, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWHC 1007 (Admin) (17 April 2015) in which  the  High
    Court said,

         "In summary, therefore, there will be cases where it is clear  that
         consideration under the Rules has fully  addressed  any  family  or
         private life issues arising under Article 8 , and where that is so
         it would be sufficient for the SSHD to say so (and the  SSHD  would
         need to expressly say  so  in  that  situation),  but  where  after
         consideration under the Rules there remains an arguable  case  that
         there may be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the
         Rules by reference to Article 8  it will be necessary for Article
         8  purposes to go on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the  new  rules  to
         require the grant of such leave."

13. Mr Shah responded  to  these  submissions  saying  that  the  Appellant
    "remained in the eye" of the authorities during all  the  time  he  was
    here.  He was making applications.  He  was  law-abiding.   He  has  no
    criminal convictions.  His wife  is  working.   He  has  no  money,  no
    family, no job in Pakistan and so could not access the medication  that
    he needs.

My findings

14. So far as the Immigration Rules are concerned the burden of proof is on
    the  Appellant  and  the  standard  of  proof  is  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities.

15. It seems that the Appellant does not meet the financial requirements of
    Appendix FM. His evidence was that  his  wife  earns  around  ï¿½900  per
    month. So far as the exception set out at paragraph EX is concerned the
    question  is  whether  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles   to   the
    Appellant's wife moving with him to Pakistan. There is  nothing  before
    me to support a submission that there are insurmountable  obstacles  to
    the Appellant and his wife continuing their family  life  in  Pakistan.
    The evidence of the Appellant's wife before Judge Lowe was that she was
    frightened of going to a country like Pakistan.  She would lose her way
    of life in the  UK.   She  would  lose  her  home  and  her  job.   The
    Appellant's wife is a mature  woman.  I  accept  that  the  culture  in
    Pakistan is different to that in the UK and that it would not  be  easy
    for her to adapt to that. The climate will be different. She presumably
    does not speak Urdu. She has a house and a job in the  UK.  She  has  a
    mother in the UK whom she sees regularly but there is no suggestion  or
    evidence   of dependency. None of the concerns she has  raised  or  the
    reasons she has given for not  wanting  to  accompany  her  husband  to
    Pakistan can in my view be said to  be  insurmountable.  None  of  them
    would cause serious  hardship.  There  is  no  evidence  to  support  a
    submission that she would be at risk in Pakistan. She would be with her
    husband and they could build  a  new  life  in  his  home  country.   I
    appreciate that she does not want to go to Pakistan and that she  would
    lose her current way of life. The fact is however  that  she  chose  to
    marry the Appellant in the knowledge  that  he  was  from  a  different
    country and practised a different  religion.  She  married  him  in  an
    Islamic ceremony. She could not reasonably have  assumed  he  would  be
    allowed to remain here. When two people from different countries form a
    relationship it is inevitable that one of them will to some extent lose
    the way of life they are accustomed to and will have to endure  changes
    and compromises. Such changes or compromises are rarely  insurmountable
    and I do not accept that they are in this case.

16. The private life of the Appellant falls to be considered  in  terms  of
    paragraph 276ADE of the Rules. He does not meet the criteria set out in
    sub -paragraphs (i) to (v). It was not submitted that he does.  I  have
    already set out the version of 276ADE(vi) that is  applicable  in  this
    case.    I find that he does not meet the requirements  of  276ADE(vi).
    He lived for 38 years in Pakistan. He was educated there. He claims  to
    have no family there but  that  is  not  so.  He  has  children  albeit
    estranged. I find it highly unlikely that having  lived  there  for  so
    long and having been educated there  he  has  no  friends  or  extended
    family there.  He  underwent  an  Islamic  marriage  ceremony  in  this
    country so is presumably a practising Muslim.  The culture of  Pakistan
    would be familiar to him.  He speaks the language.  It seems to me that
    it cannot be said that he has no  ties  there.  Bearing  in   mind  the
    findings  of  the  Tribunal  in  Ogundimu  (Article  8  -  new   rules)
    Nigeria[2013] UKUT 60  (IAC)  and   having  considered  the  facts  and
    circumstances  in  the  round  I  find  that  the  Appellant  has   not
    established that he meets the criteria set out in paragraph 276ADE (vi)
    of the Immigration Rules.

17.  The  Appellant  does  not  therefore  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. It was submitted  by  Mr  Shah  that  Article  8  is
    engaged in this case and that the  interference  with  the  Appellant's
    family life which would result from his removal from the  UK  would  be
    disproportionate to the need for effective immigration control  in  the
    UK. Having found that there are  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's wife  going with him to Pakistan there is arguably no  need
    for me to consider Article 8 because there need be no interference with
    family life. There are no compelling or compassionate circumstances  in
    this case. The fact that the Appellant's wife does not want  to  go  to
    Pakistan is not sufficient.  I shall however, for completeness  and  in
    light of the expressed position of the Appellant's wife,  deal  briefly
    with Article 8 which I shall consider in line with the guidance set out
    in Razgar, R (on the Application of) v. Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2004] UKHL 27 (17 June 2004).

18. Paragraph 117B is applicable to this  case.   It  sets  out  he  public
    interest considerations applicable to all cases in which Article  8  is
    an issue. It states:

         b Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
    public interest.

         (2) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             b) are better able to integrate into society

         (3) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.

19. It seems that the Appellant was in the UK unlawfully  between  December
    2004 and August 2008, his appeal rights having been exhausted  on  21st
    December 2004 and no further application having been made until  August
    2008, so little weight is to be given  to  his  relationship  with  his
    wife. Even if I have misinterpreted his immigration history, which  was
    not relied upon by Mr Nath,  I  do  not  accept  that  the  Appellant's
    removal would be disproportionate. He claims that he would not be  able
    to work in Pakistan or obtain housing. He claims that he would  not  be
    able to access the medication he needs because he would have no  money.
    I do not accept that. His wife has a job  and  a  house.  There  is  no
    evidence to suggest he would not be able to get work in Pakistan  where
    he lived and supported himself for many years. He came  to  the  UK  in
    2001 with a visa as a visitor.  His application for asylum was  refused
    but he did not leave the UK.  Further  applications  were  refused.  He
    still did not leave. He chose to marry in the knowledge that he had  no
    leave to be here. There are no insurmountable  obstacles  to  his  wife
    going with him to Pakistan. In all the circumstances I  find  that  any
    interference with his family life would not be disproportionate to  the
    need for effective immigration control in the UK.

20. Simply for completeness and in response to the  submissions  that  were
    made at the hearing I do not accept that it would  be  disproportionate
    to expect the Appellant to return to Pakistan to seek entry  clearance.
    In R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department)  (Appendix  FM  - Chikwamba   -  temporary  separation  -
    proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC) the Tribunal said,

          (i) Appendix FM does not include  consideration  of  the  question
         whether it would be disproportionate to  expect  an  individual  to
         return to his home country to make an entry  clearance  application
         to re-join family members in the U.K. There may be cases  in  which
         there are no insurmountable obstacles to family life being  enjoyed
         outside the U.K.  but  where  temporary  separation  to  enable  an
         individual to make  an  application  for  entry  clearance  may  be
         disproportionate. In all cases, it will be for  the  individual  to
         place before the Secretary of State evidence  that  such  temporary
         separation will interfere disproportionately with protected rights.
         It  will  not  be  enough  to  rely  solely   upon   the   case-law
         concerning Chikwamba  v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.

          (iii) In an application for leave on the basis  of  an  Article  8
         claim, the Secretary of State is not obliged to consider whether an
         application for entry clearance (if one were to be  made)  will  be
         successful. Accordingly, her silence on this issue  does  not  mean
         that it is accepted that the requirements for entry clearance to be
         granted are satisfied.

21. I find that there would be no  such  disproportionate  interference  in
    this case.
