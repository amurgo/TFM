                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants, who are citizens of Jamaica born on 9 March  1973  and
      11 November 1978 respectively, have been granted permission to  appeal
      against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Eldridge
      sitting with a non  legal  member  of  that  Tribunal),  which,  by  a
      determination promulgated on 14 October 2014, dismissed their  appeals
      against deportation orders made as a consequence of  their  conviction
      before the Snaresbrook Crown Court of serious offences concerned  with
      possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply  and  with  offences
      related to the criminal proceeds generated by that activity, including
      the handling of large amounts of cash.


   2. We shall look more closely below at those offences. At this  point  it
      is sufficient to note that the first appellant  was  sentenced  to  10
      years imprisonment and the second appellant to 8  years  imprisonment.
      Both had denied the offences but were convicted after a trial.

   3. An anonymity order was made by the First-tier  Tribunal  and  we  make
      clear that it continues to have effect. Therefore we  shall  refer  to
      the first appellant as Mr A, to the second appellant as Ms  B  and  to
      the members of their complicated family arrangements in a manner  that
      flows from that.

Immigration history and history of offending: Mr A:

   4.  Both  appellants  have  poor  immigration  histories  and  both  have
      accumulated a serious pattern of  criminal  offending  in  the  United
      Kingdom.


   5. Mr A first arrived in the United Kingdom in December 1995  seeking  to
      be admitted as a visitor. He was denied entry and removed  to  Jamaica
      the following day. At some point he returned unlawfully to the  United
      Kingdom and next came to  notice  when,  on  16  March  1999,  he  was
      convicted of 4 counts of supplying Class A drugs, assault with  intent
      to resist arrest and common assault for which he was sentenced  to  19
      months detention in a Young Offenders Institution.

   6. That conviction was  recorded  under  the  false  name  that  he  then
      provided but his fingerprints were of course taken and this conviction
      later emerged when he was arrested in his  correct  identity  for  the
      most recent offence.

   7. At some stage after serving that sentence he returned to Jamaica  and,
      having  successfully  appealed  against  refusal  of  entry  clearance
      following his marriage to a British citizen, Ms AB, he returned to the
      United Kingdom in January 2006 and was admitted with leave  to  remain
      until December 2007. In February 2008 he was granted indefinite  leave
      to remain.

   8. As we have said, on 7 October 2011 Mr A was convicted of the  offences
      that led to the deportation order he now seeks  to  challenge  on  the
      grounds that it will bring  about  an  impermissible  infringement  of
      rights protected by Article 8 of the ECHR. His  indefinite  leave  has
      been invalidated upon being served with the deportation order.

Immigration history and history of offending: Ms B:

   9. Ms B says that she moved to the United Kingdom in  August  1988,  then
      aged 9 years old, in order to join her mother and sister. That was  an
      irregular and unlawful entry as she had no leave to enter. In 2002 she
      applied for leave to remain on the basis of long residence but  before
      that application  was  determined  she  acquired  convictions  on  two
      occasions  for  offences  of  theft  and   so,   unsurprisingly,   the
      application was refused.


  10. Ms B travelled to Jamaica in August 2004 and was detained on return to
      Heathrow airport on 2 October 2004 because she  was  travelling  on  a
      fraudulently obtained  British  passport  in  another  name.  She  was
      convicted of using a false instrument and entering the United  Kingdom
      without leave and was sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment. It is clear
      that this was not the only visit made by  Ms  B  to  Jamaica.  In  her
      sentencing remarks, the judge who presided over the appellants'  trial
      in October 2011 said:

           "... over the last few years it is apparent that  she  travelled
           to Jamaica at least twice a year."

      and:

           "I note, however, that [Ms B] has, indeed, been to prison before
           and has on occasion regularly left  her  children  with  others,
           either to go on holiday with her sisters  or  a  friend  or  for
           other reasons..."

  11. After a renewed  application  for  leave  to  remain  was  refused  in
      November 2004, further representations in support  of  her  Article  8
      claim were submitted, those being refused in February  2005.  However,
      Ms B's appeal was successful with the result that, in September  2007,
      she was granted discretionary leave to remain until September 2010.

  12. Having acquired further convictions for theft, Ms B went on to  commit
      the offences together with Mr A that led to her being sentenced, on  7
      October 2011, to 8 years' imprisonment and to her being  made  subject
      to the deportation order she now seeks to challenge.

Family and Private life

  13.  As we have observed, the family arrangements of these two  appellants
      are not straightforward and we must  discuss  those  relationships  in
      some detail because they are at the heart of the issues before  us  in
      this appeal. The need to preserve the children's anonymity makes  that
      task no easier.

  14. Mr A and Ms B have been in a relationship together at the same time as
      each formed relationships with others. The sentencing judge  spoke  of
      Mr A and Mr B living together when it suited them.  That  relationship
      between Mr A and Ms B has produced two children, C1  and  C2  born  in
      1998 and 2003 respectively. Sadly, a third child was stillborn.  Those
      two children were living with Ms B at the time of her arrest but since
      then have been living with their grandmother, Ms B's mother.

  15. Although Mr A has no children from his marriage to Ms AB, he does have
      a child, C3 by another partner, Ms AC, born in 1996.  Both  the  child
      and her mother  are  Jamaican  nationals  in  receipt,  presently,  of
      discretionary leave to remain. C3 has recently given birth to her  own
      child, who is therefore Mr A's grandson. C3 continues to live, as  she
      always has, with her mother, Ms AC.

  16. In October 2005, the second appellant, Ms B, was married to Mr  PM,  a
      British citizen. They have a child, C4, born in  January  2006.  Since
      the arrest and imprisonment of her mother, C4  has  also  been  living
      with her grandmother, together with her half-siblings C1 and C2.

  17. At the date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  C1  was  16
      years old; C2 11 years old; C3 17 years and 9  months  old  and  C4  8
      years old.

The offences giving rise to the deportation order

  18. The offences were described by the Judge Eldridge as follows:


           "The offences involved 376 grams of crack cocaine.  Cash  seized
           was �40,500 on the occasion when the drugs  were  found.  In  an
           earlier search less than a fortnight before �25,500 in cash  was
           seized but no drugs then found (a dog was  used  on  the  second
           occasion). Investigation of bank accounts  showed  over  �39,000
           that [Ms B] could not account  for  and  a  further  �27,000  in
           respect of [Mr A]. A Rolex watch was found  concealed  with  the
           drugs in the "cavities" of a washing machine  -  its  value  was
           �18,000 in 2002 when last valued. The total sums involved  were,
           therefore, �150,000. This does not take account of the value  of
           the cocaine, which we consider  would  certainly  have  been  in
           excess of �10,000 (and probably much more) at street value  when
           cut  and  distributed.  We  understand  why  Judge  Kamill  (the
           sentencing judge) placed them "just  below"  the  leaders  in  a
           drugs distribution concern."


      The judge made clear what was the assessment of the seriousness of the
      offences"


           "In our view these are most serious offences. The sums of  money
           and quantity show this to be so. The  misery  and  damage  their
           sustained drug dealing would have caused is difficult  to  over-
           estimate not just to the users themselves but to  other  victims
           of crimes perpetrated to feed the habits of those users. In  our
           view, the seriousness of the offences was compounded by the fact
           that the goods concerned and cash obtained were concealed  in  a
           house where three of the children lived and, indeed, some of the
           cash  was  found  in  their  bedroom.  The  public  interest  in
           deportation is all the  higher  for  this  reason  -  s  117C(2)
           applies in respect of both appellants."

  19. Judge Eldridge went on to examine the legal  framework  applicable  to
      the assessment to be carried out and to make clear the approach  taken
      by the panel in doing so. In short, as these two appellants  had  each
      been sentenced to more than 4  years'  imprisonment,  they  could  not
      succeed under the family and private  life  provisions  of  the  rules
      unless they established that there were very compelling  circumstances
      over and above what  was  required  to  bring  themselves  within  the
      statutory exceptions of  s  117C  (4)  and  (5)  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as  amended).   He  set  out  in  his
      determination the reasons why, in respect of each of  the  appellants,
      the panel had not found that to have been established.


   The grant of permission to appeal


  20.  It is, perhaps, unfortunate that although these  appeals  were  heard
      and determined together, applications for permission  to  appeal  were
      considered separately, by different judges of the First-tier Tribunal.


  21. In granting Ms B  permission  to  appeal,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Cheales identified  two  concerns.  First,  at  paragraph  23  of  the
      determination Judge Eldridge said, in respect of both appellants:


           "... We were disinclined to give credit to any account from them
           that was not supported by cogent, credible evidence  from  other
           sources"


      which Judge Cheales thought might arguably amount to a misdirection in
      law. Secondly, Judge Cheales thought that an error of law was arguably
      disclosed by a failure  to  consider  the  circumstances  of  the  two
      appellants separately when assessing credibility.  Having  said  that,
      Judge Cheales said that all grounds were arguable  without  expressing
      any view at all why that was so.


  22. Mr A's application for permission to appeal was refused by the  First-
      tier Tribunal but granted by a judge of the Upper  Tribunal  who  said
      this:


           "While I have considerable  reservations  about  the  underlying
           merits of this appeal, given the very long  sentence  passed  on
           the applicant in connection with dealing in  drugs,  his  appeal
           was heard with that of [Ms B]. Permission to appeal to the Upper
           Tribunal has been granted in that matter. In the  circumstances,
           I consider that it would be in the interests of justice to grant
           permission on all grounds."


  23. The grounds of the two appellants are, as we shall see, wide  ranging.
      Thus we find ourselves in the remarkable position that the  appellants
      have been granted permission to appeal  without  either  judge  having
      actually engaged with much of the  basis  upon  which  permission  was
      sought and, other than what we have said above  about  Judge  Cheales'
      view of a small part of the grounds, without having expressed any view
      at all as to whether  the  grounds  are  arguable.  Indeed,  the  only
      judicial view expressed about the arguability of  Mr  A's  grounds  is
      that they are not arguable at all.


  24. As the appellants are separately represented we shall  summarised  the
      grounds relied upon by each in turn.

Grounds advanced by Mr A

  25. The grounds upon which Mr A challenges the determination of his appeal
      by the First-tier Tribunal may be summarised as follows:


          a. The panel was wrong to infer from the fact that Mr A's wife, Ms
             AB, had not attended to give oral evidence that therefore their
             relationship was "precarious at best";


          b. The panel erred in law in placing little  weight  upon  Mr  A's
             "rehabilitative work in prison";

          c. It was an error of law to consider the separation between Mr  A
             and his British citizen wife that arose because of imprisonment
             as  a  complete  answer  to  whether  separation  arising  from
             deportation  would   give   rise   to   the   very   compelling
             circumstances demanded by s 117C(6) of the 2002 Act;

          d. It was also an error of law for  the  panel  to  conclude  that
             being in the company of convicted  drug  dealers  was  "not  an
             environment that benefits  children",  because  past  offending
             does  not  signal  future  offending  and  the   panel   failed
             adequately to have regard to the rehabilitative work  completed
             by Mr A in prison;

          e. The fifth ground, which to an extent covers  the  same  ground,
             complains that the panel has not adequately explained what were
             the "significant factors" that led them to  conclude  that  the
             best interests of the  children  did  not  require  that  their
             parents were not deported.

          f.  Finally,  in  developing  his  grounds  in  oral  submissions,
             although Mr Hawkin confirmed that  the  above  summary  was  an
             accurate distillation of his  written  grounds  of  appeal,  he
             identified a sixth line of challenge he wished to  pursue.  His
             submission was to the effect that in  deciding  to  take  as  a
             starting  point  a  complete  rejection  of   the   appellants'
             credibility, so that the panel would  not  accept  to  be  true
             anything asserted unless it  were  supported  by  corroborative
             evidence, the panel fettered  their  assessment  of  the  claim
             before them and therefore failed to consider the  circumstances
             as a whole, as they should have done.

Grounds advanced by Ms B

  26. Eight threads of challenge can be drawn from the grounds:


          a. The determination "is fundamentally flawed, in that they should
             have produced and considered each appellant's case in isolation
             of  the  other"  so  that  the  panel  erred  in  not  properly
             addressing matters "unique" to Ms B's case;


          b. It was an error of law for the panel to  require  corroboration
             before accepting the truth of anything said by the  appellants.
             This being the  same  issue  raised  in  the  sixth  ground  we
             identified having been raised by Mr Hawkin;

          c. The panel was wrong to "discount" the  weight  of  testimonials
             and certificates obtained in prison  on  the  basis  that  they
             arose while the appellant was "in a secure environment with few
             outside temptations";

          d. An error of law is disclosed also in the failure to have regard
             for Ms B's lack of knowledge of the drugs and money "stashed in
             the washing machine", something for which  Mr  A  had  accepted
             responsibility;

          e. In finding that the best interest of the children was not to be
             with their parents, the panel erred in not factoring in what Ms
             B had done in prison to address  her  offending  behaviour.  In
             this regard, the panel should have considered the  position  of
             the parents separately and not together;

          f. The panel erred in setting the bar too high. The requirement of
             very compelling circumstances is accepted to be a high one  but
             the panel erred in seeing it to be an unrealistically high  one
             which makes it impossible for any appellant to succeed.

          g. It was also an error of law for  the  panel  to  leave  out  of
             account that Ms B's mother, the grandmother of C1, C2  and  C4,
             who is now caring for those children has only precarious  leave
             to remain that needs to be renewed every 6 months.

          h. Finally, the grounds complain  that  the  panel  erred  in  not
             having regard to the medical evidence  produced  concerning  Ms
             B's "long standing medical condition".

  27. We shall address each of those grounds in turn.


   Challenges to the determination pursued on behalf of Mr A.


  28. The first challenge raised on behalf of Mr A is that the  judge  erred
      in drawing from the absence of Mr A's wife that their relationship was
      "precarious at best". That was because Ms AB had offered in a  witness
      statement an explanation, that being work commitments:

           "I am unfortunately unable to attend the  hearing  set  for  the
           30/09/14 due to work commitments.  However  I  am  available  by
           telephone between the hours of 12.00-13.00 and 16:00 onwards.


           I would like to  maintain  that  I  do  strenuously  support  my
           husband, and although I can not be  present  I  would  like  the
           court to take into consideration my statement."

      The judge made clear what the panel made of this at  paragraph  25  of
      his determination:

           "We should make findings about both  Appellants  in  respect  of
           partners. They are not each other's partner.  Each  of  them  is
           married to someone else. Judge  Kamill  (the  sentencing  judge)
           noted however that the Appellants lived together "when it suited
           them". Although their spouses have provided  statements  in  one
           format  or  another,  neither  attended  the  hearing  to   give
           evidence. We took this to be a practical  demonstration  of  the
           state of the relationships - that is  they  were  precarious  at
           best.


           The  Appellants,  through  their  actions,   have   caused   the
           separation from their spouses for four and five  years.  We  saw
           nothing in the partner relationships that  led  us  to  conclude
           deportation would provide  undue  hardship  let  alone  anything
           beyond that."


  29. In our judgement those findings were plainly and  unquestionably  open
      to the panel. The witness statement of Ms AB was dated 29 August 2014,
      which was about a month before the hearing she said she was unable  to
      attend because of work commitments. No attempt  was  made  to  explain
      what was the nature of the work commitments that  prevented  her  from
      attending to take up  the  one  opportunity  available  to  give  oral
      evidence in support of her husband's  attempt  to  resist  what  might
      prove to be permanent removal from the  United  Kingdom.  Her  absence
      from the hearing was particularly notable because the  Tribunal  heard
      oral evidence  from  no  fewer  than  nine  witnesses,  including  the
      appellants themselves. It is  clear  that  the  panel  had  regard  to
      everything set out in Ms AB's witness statement because they said they
      had done just that. It was for the panel to weigh  this  part  of  the
      evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole and to make  of  it
      what they did.


  30. Those findings are a complete answer to the  third  ground  identified
      above, that being the complaint that it was an error of  law  for  the
      panel to consider that because the appellants had  themselves  brought
      about  the  separation  from  their   spouses   arising   from   their
      imprisonment,  therefore  there   would   not   be   very   compelling
      circumstances  over  and  above  what  was  required   to   meet   the
      requirements of Exception 2 of s117C(5). Plainly, once it is accepted,
      as it must be, that the finding of fact in respect of  the  precarious
      state of the relationship between Mr A and his spouse is unassailable,
      this ground is entirely without merit also.

  31. The second ground identified above is that the panel erred in  law  in
      failing to attach appropriate  weight  to  the  "rehabilitative  work"
      carried out in prison by Mr A. At paragraph 24  of  the  determination
      the judge observed of courses undertaken in prison by both  appellants
      and what they said in evidence they had learned from them:

           "... inevitably these achievements have been made  in  a  secure
           environment and with few outside temptations. We also  note  the
           OASys assessments provided and the conclusions of low  risk.  We
           do not consider these factors add much to what we have to  find-
           very compelling circumstances. They are at best some  relatively
           slight factors in  the  Appellant's  favour  compared  with  the
           serious offending over time in the past.


      Mr Hawkin submitted that the  judge  was  wrong  to  "discount"  these
      factors. We do not accept that submission. The judge was  setting  out
      clearly what the panel had made of this evidence and the weight to  be
      attached to it was a matter  for  the  panel  who  having  heard  oral
      evidence from both appellants, were best placed to do  so.  The  panel
      had taken account of  the  fact  that  these  appellants  were  repeat
      offenders, both of whom  had  served  previous  prison  sentences.  At
      paragraph 37 of the determination the judge noted:


           "Additionally, [Mr A] has served a term of 18 months  previously
           for drug dealing and was not  deterred  by  it.  [Ms  B]  has  a
           history of dishonesty and as Judge Kamill has made clear she has
           also served imprisonment before..."

  32.  Given the circumstances considered as a whole,  it  was  plainly  and
      unambiguously open to the panel to conclude that little  weight  could
      be given to these matters and they made no error of law in  so  doing.
      It  cannot  be  said  that  was  an  assessment  that  disclosed   any
      irrationality or other unlawfulness.


  33. The fourth ground pursued by Mr Hawkin on behalf  of  Mr  A  raises  a
      challenge to the reasoning set out at paragraphs 36-37 and 40  of  the
      determination concerning the best interests of the children. In short,
      it is submitted that the findings of the panel  in  this  regard  were
      wrongly  predicated  upon  an  impermissible   prediction   that   the
      appellants would continue to deal in Class A drugs upon  release  from
      prison, despite the rehabilitative work completed in  prison  and  the
      OASys assessment of a low risk of  reoffending.  The  judge  made  the
      following observations:

           "... we cannot agree that it is wholly in the interests  of  the
           children to be with their parents." (para 35)


           "Their parents were drug dealers with drugs and  large  sums  of
           money in their home. The conduct which led to their  convictions
           could not be seen to be spontaneous or opportunistic. As set out
           by Judge Kamill, they were an integral part of  an  organisation
           and just below the leaders. �150,000  must  have  been  acquired
           over a considerable period. Such  is  not  an  environment  that
           benefits children - either their safety or their welfare." (para
           36)


           "... whilst there are the obvious potential benefits of hands on
           day to day care, we also see significant factors that suggest it
           is not in the best interests of the children that their  parents
           should remain in  this  country  once  they  are  released  from
           prison." (para 40)

  34. We do not accept the submission that here the judge is carrying out an
      assessment of what is in the best interests of  the  children  on  the
      basis and in the expectation that their parents would continue to deal
      in drugs after their release from imprisonment. At paragraph  36,  the
      description of the parents as drug dealers is expressed  in  the  past
      tense. The judge was doing no more than recording what is an  historic
      and indisputable fact. It is not in dispute that the appellants  dealt
      in Class A drugs from the home where those young children were living,
      keeping drugs and large sums of cash in the family home. Sums of  cash
      were concealed in the bedroom used by the  children.  The  finding  of
      fact that such was  not  an  environment  that  benefits  children  is
      unassailable.


  35. At paragraph 40 the panel seeks to draw together the evidence  and  to
      strike a balance between competing factors in play. On the  one  hand,
      the panel has examined the evidence that  speaks  in  the  appellants'
      favour, as has already  been  discussed  in  the  determination.  This
      included the rehabilitative work carried out in prison; the  low  risk
      of  reoffending  predicted  by  the  OASys  report;  the  professional
      assessment  of  difficulties  being  encountered  by  the  children's'
      grandmother as she struggled to deal with the challenge of caring  for
      them while their parents were in prison and  the  close  relationships
      described between the appellants and the children and the effect  upon
      the children of separation from their parents. On the other hand,  the
      panel had regard to the fact that these  were  parents  who  were  not
      simply involved in a significant drugs supply operation conducted from
      the family home, but that the father was someone who  had  a  previous
      conviction for dealing in Class A drugs and had served an earlier term
      of imprisonment, suggesting strongly that the rehabilitative effect of
      that was limited. The children's mother had  also  served  a  previous
      sentence of imprisonment and so this  subsequent  conviction  provided
      support for concerns that the rehabilitative effect of that  had  also
      been limited.

  36. For these reasons we are entirely satisfied that this  ground  is  not
      made out. As was observed by Mr Walker in making submissions on behalf
      of the respondent, the determination must be read as a whole  and  not
      sliced up into separate pieces for the purpose of examining individual
      findings of fact and the challenges being made to them. We agree.

  37. In any event, even if, which we do not accept  to  be  the  case,  the
      panel erred in allowing the assessment of the best  interests  of  the
      children to be informed by an impermissible assumption  as  to  future
      unlawful conduct, we have no doubt at all, given  the  other  findings
      set out in the determination, that the outcome  would  have  been  the
      same, even if the panel accepted that it would have been in  the  best
      interest of the children to maintain relationships with their  parents
      in the United Kingdom after they are released from prison.

  38. Put another way, it is unambiguously  clear  from  the  determination,
      read as a whole, that the panel took the view that  this  was  a  case
      where the seriousness of the offences and the  need  to  deter  others
      present in the United Kingdom but subject to immigration control  from
      committing similar  offences  was  such  that  those  public  interest
      considerations must prevail. This  was  a  case  where  the  case  for
      deportation was simply overwhelming and the panel was plainly entitled
      to take the view,  expressed  at  paragraph  45,  that  the  need  for
      deterrence was "central" to their decision:

           "[Mr A's] offending is most serious. He may have  made  progress
           in prison and be assessed as being of low risk but at  no  stage
           were we addressed on the important factor of the  deterrence  of
           others.  It  is  central,  in  our  view,  to  the  question  of
           deportation that not only is the offender unable to commit  more
           offences  but  that  the  message  is  given  to  other  foreign
           nationals tempted to commit serious  offences  that  the  normal
           consequences will be that they will face deportation."


  39. The fifth ground of challenge pursued by Mr Hawkin on behalf of  Mr  A
      can be seen to tread the same ground we have just examined. He submits
      that the panel failed to  explain  just  what  were  "the  significant
      factors" that led them to conclude  that  the  best  interest  of  the
      children did not require that their patents  were  not  deported.  The
      comments  we  have  made  above  apply  equally  in  respect  of  that
      submission.


  40. In his oral submissions, Mr Hawkin submitted that the evidence  before
      the First-tier Tribunal provided strong support  for  concluding  that
      there were present the very compelling circumstances  over  and  above
      what was required to meet the requirements of Exception 2 of s.117C(5)
      so that the appellant should have succeeded under  that  provision  so
      that the public interest did not require deportation. Implicit in  his
      submission was that the panel either failed to have  regard  to  these
      matters or failed to afford them adequate  weight.  Those  matters  he
      summarised as follows, arguing that they demonstrated the detriment to
      the children that had arisen because of the absence from  their  lives
      of both parents, such detriment needing to be addressed  by  reuniting
      them when their parents were released from prison:

          a.  The  children's  grandmother  had  explained  in  her  witness
             statement something of the problems  she  was  experiencing  in
             managing the behaviour of the children;


          b. Before the panel was a letter from the school  attended  by  C4
             dated 4 July 2014 expressing concern that the children

                 "...are finding the current circumstances related to  their
                 parents'  incarceration  difficult  to  manage.   This   is
                 becoming apparent particularly with [C4's]  behaviour  both
                 at home and at school..."

          c. There was also a letter from  Young  Hackney,  an  organisation
             providing support to young people, dated 1 July 2014 that spoke
             of  the  children's  "anxiety  centred  on  parents  serving  a
             custodial sentence and possible deportation", speaking  of  the
             consequences of that anxiety and counselling and support to  be
             provided;


          d. A letter from Homerton University Hospital dated  17  September
             2014 provided details of health issues for which the children's
             grandmother was being treated for in the  light  of  which  she
             said she "felt overwhelmed  with  duties  and  responsibilities
             that due to her age and her health she cannot cope with,  on  a
             permanent basis." Further, there was insecurity arisng from her
             precarious immigration status, as she had to reapply for  leave
             to remain every six months.

  41. None of that takes the appellants any further  at  all.  All  of  this
      evidence was considered by the panel and they took account  of  it  in
      reaching their assessment. At paragraph 31 of  the  determination  the
      judge noted that, in a CAMHS  assessment  "dated  as  recently  as  26
      September 2014" the children's grandmother was considered to be  doing
      "an excellent job of supporting the  children".  Social  Services  are
      fully sighted upon the arrangements for the care of the  children  now
      in place and so alert to any difficulty that falls to be managed.  The
      panel heard oral evidence from C4 and  the judge said, at paragraph 29
      of the determination, that the  documented  assertions  of  confidence
      issues  did  not  accord  with  his  oral  evidence  and  how  it  was
      delivered, the judge observing that:


           "... He was confident and very articulate. He impressed us  with
           his maturity..."


  42. In sum, the panel has carried out a careful assessment of the evidence
      before them relating to each of the children and have given clear  and
      legally sufficient reasons for reaching conclusions that were open  to
      them on the evidence.


  43. The final matter raised by Mr Hawkin related to what was said  by  the
      panel at paragraph 23 of the determination about the appellants'  lack
      of credibility. As this precise challenge was pursued also by Mr  Rene
      on behalf of Ms B we shall consider what is said  on  behalf  of  both
      appellant's in respect of this issue below, when we address Mr  Rene's
      arguments.


   Challenges to the determination pursued on behalf of Ms B


  44. We have set out above a summary of the  grounds  upon  which  Mr  Rene
      pursued his challenge to the determination on behalf of Ms  B  and  he
      confirmed that each was maintained.


  45. The first ground can be dealt  with  shortly.  It  is  said  that  the
      determination is "fundamentally flawed" because the  panel  failed  to
      consider each appellant's case "in isolation from the other"  so  that
      the panel failed to address issues unique to Ms B.

  46. That, with respect, is  a  hopeless  challenge  for  several  reasons.
      First, there was no  objection  advanced  to  the  proposal  that  the
      appeals be  determined  together  pursuant  to  rule  20  of  the  AIT
      (Procedure) Rules 2005 and the judge made clear, at paragraph 8 of the
      determination, that despite that he was at pains:

           "... to make it plain, as should be seen,  that  we  have  given
           individual consideration to each appeal and Appellant."


      That this is precisely what was done  is  demonstrated  by  references
      throughout the determination to one appellant or the other or to  them
      both. At paragraph 47 the judge recorded that:


           "[Ms B] presents additional factors..."


      And went on to consider them.

  47. Mr Rene complained next that  the  panel  had  decided  to  treat  the
      appellants as completely incredible and so  to  require  corroboration
      before accepting the truth of anything they said. This  challenge  was
      pursued also by Mr Hawkin in his submissions. This is what  the  judge
      wrote at paragraph 23:


           "The sentencing remarks of the judge also inform our view of the
           general credibility of each Appellant.  We  take  seriously  her
           conclusion that both are accomplished  liars  and  that  [Mr  A]
           sought to distance himself from responsibility. Additionally, we
           note that [Ms B] has a history of dishonesty. Both were  plainly
           disbelieved by the jury. We were disinclined to give  credit  to
           any account from them that was not supported by cogent, credible
           evidence from other sources."

      We can identify no legal  error  in  those  remarks.  The  panel  were
      plainly entitled to draw upon the sentencing remarks of the judge  who
      had presided over two trials (the first failing to deliver a verdict).
      In any event, this  was  not  a  case  that  turned  upon  credibility
      findings. Mr Hawkin and Mr Rene were invited to point to  any  finding
      by the panel whereby that had rejected an assertion of  fact  made  by
      either appellant but they were unable to do so.


  48. The third ground, complaining that the panel was wrong  to  "discount"
      the weight to be given to testimonials and  certificates  obtained  in
      prison, is the same as we have considered above when  considering  the
      grounds pursued by Mr A and we need say nothing more about that.


  49. The next ground is founded on a submission from Mr Rene  that  can  be
      described only as bold and remarkable. He argues that the panel  erred
      in failing to reach their own finding of fact as to whether Ms  B  had
      any knowledge that drugs and cash had been hidden in the flat by Mr A.
      This is because, during oral evidence before the Tribunal,  Ms  B  had
      said  she  was  unaware  of  this  and  Mr   A   had   accepted   full
      responsibility.

  50. Not only did the panel make no  error  in  adopting  the  position  as
      identified in the judge's sentencing remarks, it  would  have  been  a
      clear and obvious error of law had  the panel sought to go behind  the
      finding of the jury that both appellants were fully complicit  in  the
      offence and the sentencing remarks of the judge who made unambiguously
      clear that she sentenced on the basis  of  joint  responsibility,  the
      disparity in sentence being attributable only to the fact  that  Mr  A
      had previously been convicted of a similar offence.

  51. It might  be  observed,  also,  that  the  judge  made  clear  in  her
      sentencing remarks that she treated the appellants  as  being  equally
      culpable:

           "I take the view that [Mr A] is a calculating man  open  to  the
           best chance, but [Ms B] is his equal. It was  suggested  to  the
           jury that she is  a  vulnerable  woman  and  that  [Mr  A]  took
           advantage of her. That was not my impression and, indeed, it  is
           possible that the reverse is  correct  but  I  make,  again,  no
           judgment there."

  52. The fifth ground is that the panel gave inadequate weight to what Ms B
      had done in prison to address her  offending  behaviour.  Once  again,
      this is the same challenge as raised on behalf of Mr A  and,  for  the
      same reasons we have given above, it is simply not arguable.

  53. The next ground is best reproduced as it is written before we  address
      it:

           "The panel throughout the determination make  reference  to  the
           test of "very compelling circumstances". It is accepted that  it
           is a high one, but at the same time it should not be interpreted
           in an  unrealistically  high  way,  which  would  then  make  it
           impossible for an appellant to ever  succeed.  It  is  submitted
           that this is what done by the panel when it  comes  to  [Ms  B].
           There is also  a  failure  by  the  panel  to  look  at  factors
           cumulatively as "circumstances"."


  54. Before addressing this ground it is helpful to set out  s117C  of  the
      2002 Act:


                 117C  Article  8:  additional   considerations   in   cases
                 involving foreign criminals

                     . (1)  The deportation of foreign criminals is  in  the
                       public interest.

                     . (2)  The more serious  the  offence  committed  by  a
                       foreign criminal, the greater is the public  interest
                       in deportation of the criminal.

                     . (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who  has
                       not been sentenced to a  period  of  imprisonment  of
                       four years or more, the public interest requires  C's
                       deportation  unless  Exception  1  or   Exception   2
                       applies.

                     . (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

                          . (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United
                            Kingdom for most of C's life,

                          . (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in
                            the United Kingdom, and

                          . (c)  there would be very significant  obstacles
                            to C's integration into the country to which  C
                            is proposed to be deported.

                     . (5)  Exception 2 applies where C has  a  genuine  and
                       subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or
                       a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a
                       qualifying child, and the effect of  C's  deportation
                       on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

                     . (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who  has  been
                       sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at  least
                       four years, the public interest requires  deportation
                       unless there are very compelling circumstances,  over
                       and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

                 (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be
                 taken into account where a court or tribunal is considering
                 a decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the  extent
                 that the  reason  for  the  decision  was  the  offence  or
                 offences for which the criminal has been convicted.

      It can be seen from this that the approach taken by the  panel  cannot
      be faulted.  It  was  a  requirement  of  primary  legislation,  as  a
      consequence of the imposition of a (substantially)  longer  period  of
      imprisonment than  4  years,  that  it  was  not  sufficient  for  the
      appellant  to  establish  that  she  had  a  genuine  and   subsisting
      relationship with her children in respect of whom the  effect  of  her
      deportation, in this case taken together with the deportation of their
      father or step father also, would be unduly harsh. It  was  necessary,
      in addition to that, for the appellant to  point  to  very  compelling
      circumstances, over and above that, and it was unquestionably open  to
      the panel to conclude that she had failed to do so.


  55. When examined, this ground appears to be more of a challenge  to  that
      primary legislation rather than the application of it to the facts  of
      this case by the panel that determined the appeal and as such  has  no
      prospect whatever of succeeding. In any event, this ground  is  wholly
      unarguable as the conclusion of the panel that, in this case,  neither
      appellant had identified such very compelling circumstances  over  and
      above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2 of s117C was one that  was
      unarguably open to them. Put another way,  the  appellants  failed  to
      meet the requirements of  s117C  not  because  the  panel  applied  an
      unrealistically high test but because the evidence  to  establish  the
      very compelling circumstances required over and above Exceptions 1 and
      2 was simply absent.


  56. The seventh ground complains that no regard, or no sufficient  regard,
      was had by the panel to the precarious  nature  of  the  grandmother's
      leave to remain and the need to renew it every six months. As we  have
      explained, that is simply not sustainable because the panel  addressed
      that issue specifically at paragraph 28 of the determination  and  so,
      plainly, it has been factored into the assessment carried  out,  there
      being no reason at all to suppose, having taken the trouble to  record
      that information in the determination, the panel then left it  out  of
      account. Further, as  we  have  observed,  there  is  social  services
      involvement with the care of the children and there is  no  suggestion
      from that source that the need for the children's grandmother to renew
      regularly her leave to remain so that there is continuity of the  care
      arrangements in place is something that has  impacted  adversely  upon
      the children.

  57. The last point taken by Mr Rene concerned the alleged failure  of  the
      panel to have regard to Ms B's "long standing medical  condition."  In
      this regard, he referred us specifically to two doctors' letters  upon
      which reliance is placed upon. The first is from Dr Waters of City and
      Hackney NHS Trust dated  24  June  2005.  This  is  a  referral  to  a
      Consultant Psychiatrist at Homerton Hospital. But that letter  was  10
      years old at the date of the hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      and so a decade old diagnosis  of  depression  was  not  a  cogent  or
      compelling basis upon which to inform findings made by the panel.  The
      second letter is a little more recent being a letter from a Consultant
      Psychiatrist to Ms B's G.P. dated June 2010, which is more  than  four
      years before the hearing. In any event, that letter confirms that:

           "[Ms B's] mental state has significantly  improved  and  she  is
           recovering from her latest bout of depression."


  58. It is impossible to see how the panel can properly be  criticised  for
      not dealing specifically with this evidence in the  determination.  We
      have looked carefully to see what other material was available to  the
      judge. Although there are some quite lengthy records  of  the  medical
      care provided to Ms B while serving her prison sentence, Mr  Rene  did
      not refer to this evidence and there is nothing to suggest that it was
      relied upon before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Having  examined  that
      evidence ourselves, it is not difficult to see  why  no  reliance  was
      placed upon it as it does not support a submission founded upon Ms B's
      ill-heath.


  59.  For all of these reasons we are entirely  satisfied  that  the  panel
      made no errors of law and there is no  basis  at  all  upon  which  to
      interfere  with  the  determination.  We  make  also   the   following
      observation.  As  a  result  of  having  committed  serious   offences
      resulting in lengthy sentences of imprisonment the appellants fell  to
      be treated as foreign criminals whose deportation  is  in  the  public
      interest. That public interest in their deportation was reinforced  by
      a number of factors, each identified by the  judge  in  his  carefully
      written determination. Given the applicable  statutory  framework  and
      the facts as they were found to be, the panel was plainly  correct  to
      assess the public interest in deportation in  this  case  to  be  very
      significant indeed. Even if  it  had  been  the  case  that  the  best
      interests of the children were in maintaining relationships with their
      parents in the United Kingdom it is very hard to see how, on the facts
      of this case those interest would not have  to  yield  to  the  public
      interest  in  deporting  the  appellants.  Indeed,  it  may   not   be
      overstating the position to observe that it is difficult  to  see  how
      any other outcome was rationally open.

Summary of decision:

  60. The First-tier Tribunal made no error of  law  and  the  determination
      shall stand.


  61. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
