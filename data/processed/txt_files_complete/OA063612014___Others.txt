Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr. I. Maka, Counsel, instructed by Blackstone
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A. Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellants against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge M. R. Oliver, promulgated on 6 May  2016,  in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellants' appeals against the Respondent's decision  to
    refuse entry clearance as the partner and children of the Sponsor.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:

         "The grounds argue that the Judge erred  in  his  approach  to  the
         financial requirements and the English language  issue.   He  found
         that the evidence submitted post-dated the  applications  but  this
         was not a point taken by the ECO.  The evidence  should  have  been
         present in the Respondent's bundle but  was  not.   The  Appellants
         only submitted evidence as to the genuineness of  the  relationship
         which was the reason for the refusal.  The Judge did not raise this
         point at the commencement of the hearing and so the Appellants were
         not allowed the opportunity of supplying further evidence.

         It is arguable that a procedural unfairness arose as the result  of
         the Judge raising a fresh issue and  not  allowing  the  Appellants
         time to address it.  Permission is therefore granted."

 3. The Sponsor attended the hearing.  Ms Fijiwala referred to the Rule  24
    response and submitted at the outset  of  the  hearing  that  that  the
    decision should be set aside and the appeals allowed.

 4. Having considered the documents before me, together with the concession
    by Ms Fijiwala, I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and
    remade  the  decision  allowing  the  Appellants'  appeals  under   the
    immigration rules.  My full reasons are set out below.

Error of law

 5. The judge states at paragraph 8 that he  allowed  the  appeals  at  the
    hearing but then goes on to address the fact that  two  further  issues
    presented themselves.  In paragraphs 9 and 10 he deals with the lack of
    evidence which he states was provided  in  relation  to  the  financial
    requirements and the English language requirement.  In paragraph 11  he
    states that he "has to concede my error and reverse the decision I  too
    hastily announced".

 6. I have considered the notices of  decision,  and  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager's review.  It is clear  from  these  documents  that  the  sole
    reason that the applications were refused was due to  the  relationship
    requirements not being met.  This is the sole issue addressed and there
    is no reference to either the financial  requirements  or  the  English
    language requirements in either document.

 7. Ms Fijiwala accepted on behalf of the Respondent that the sole issue of
    whether or not the first Appellant and Sponsor were in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship was by  reference  to  the  DNA  evidence.   In
    paragraph 6 of the decision the judge states:

         "Of crucial importance was the submission of DNA  evidence  to  the
         hearing.  Samples taken during the summer and autumn of 2015 proved
         the relationship of all the parties conclusively."

 8.  Ms  Fijiwala  confirmed  that  the  Respondent   accepted   that   the
    relationship between the first Appellant and Sponsor  was  genuine  and
    subsisting by reference to this DNA evidence and that  therefore,  this
    issue having been addressed, the  appeals  should  have  been  allowed.
    However, instead of allowing the appeals once he was satisfied that the
    relationship requirements had been met, the judge went on  to  consider
    whether the financial requirements and English language requirements of
    the immigration rules had been met.

 9. I find that,  in  going  on  to  consider  issues  not  raised  by  the
    Respondent, especially given that he did not raise  these  issues  with
    the Appellants' representatives or Sponsor at the  hearing,  the  judge
    made a material error of law.

Notice of Decision

10. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involves  the  making  of  a
    material error of law, and I set it aside.

11. I remake the  decision  allowing  the  Appellants'  appeals  under  the
    immigration rules.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeals and a fee has been paid.  It was  submitted  that
the first Appellant and Sponsor had stated  from  the  beginning  that  they
were in a genuine and subsisting relationship, and that the  Appellants  and
Sponsor were related as claimed.  Given that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
had accepted that the relationship was genuine, it was submitted that a  fee
award should be made for the total fee paid, ï¿½700.

I find that the applications were refused as the Respondent considered  that
the relationship requirements were not met.  In the notice of  decision  for
the first Appellant  the  Respondent  referred  to  copies  of  two  British
passports which had been provided  for  children  born  on  or  after  2006.
These  were  provided  as  evidence  that  the  Sponsor  was  British.   The
Respondent stated that no evidence had been provided  to  substantiate  that
these two British children were related to either the first Appellant or  to
the Sponsor.  The Respondent  went  on  to  state,  with  reference  to  the
marriage certificate, that he was not satisfied that  the  Sponsor  and  the
first Appellant were married as claimed given  the  difference  between  the
date of marriage and date of issue of the certificate.  She also cast  doubt
on the birth certificates provided.   Further,  the  Afghan  identity  cards
named the father, but not the mother.

In the Entry Clearance Manager's review further consideration was  given  to
these documents, but the decision was not reversed.  Reference was  made  to
the lack of DNA evidence which the  first  Appellant  had  stated  could  be
provided.

I find  that  the  Respondent  had  genuine  concerns  about  the  documents
provided to establish the relationship between the first Appellant  and  the
Sponsor.  I have taken into account the submissions made by the  Appellants'
representative relating to the  British  passports,  but  I  find  that  the
Respondent was not satisfied as to the evidence produced,  and  the  British
passports provided would have not indicated that  the  first  Appellant  and
Sponsor were the parents of the children so as to establish the genuine  and
subsisting nature of the relationship.  While it is true  that  the  Sponsor
would have had to have provided evidence that he was the father in order  to
obtain the passports, such evidence was not provided to the Entry  Clearance
Officer.  It is not clear what evidence this was, and therefore  whether  it
would  necessarily  have  indicated  that  the  first  Appellant   was   the
children's mother.  There is no  evidence  before  me  that  there  was  any
evidence before the Entry Clearance Officer that  the  first  Appellant  was
the mother of these children so as to show that she was  in  a  genuine  and
subsisting relationship with the Sponsor.,

I find that the Entry Clearance Officer  had  justified  concerns  with  the
evidence before him, and I therefore do not make a fee award.
