For the Appellant:     Mrs T Choudhry, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. In this case the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  appeals
    against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on  27
    January 2014 whereby it allowed the appeal of  Mr  Rajesh  Reddy  Sanga
    against the Secretary of State's refusal to grant him leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system.

 2. The history of Mr Sanga's presence in the United Kingdom is as follows.
    He is a citizen of India and is now 30 years of age, having  been  born
    on 29 March 1984.  On 14 October 2008 he  entered  the  United  Kingdom
    with leave as a student, valid until 31 May 2010.  On 24 June  2010  he
    was granted leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student  valid  until
    30 April 2011.  On 13 May 2011 he was granted leave to remain as a Tier
    1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant valid until 13 May 2013.  The nature of his
    work was energy efficiency and he carried out surveys for those wishing
    to access the financing of energy efficiency schemes.

 3. On 13 May 2013 Mr Sanga applied to the Secretary of State for leave  to
    remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system.  As such he required to be awarded a total of 95 points; 75  of
    which were required to be awarded under Appendix A:  Attributes.   This
    was the part of the system which evidenced his ability to prove that he
    had sufficient finance to support his business in the  United  Kingdom.
    As part of the application he asserted that he had  access  to  �25,000
    which had been made available to him by a  third  party,  and  supplied
    documentation in support of that assertion.   The  Secretary  of  State
    refused the application in a decision letter dated 13 June 2013.

 4. The Secretary of State stated that four of the documents which had been
    supplied with the application did not comply  with  the  provisions  of
    paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.  In that:

           i.  the bank letter,

             "...is not acceptable because it does  not  confirm  that  the
             institution is regulated by the appropriate  regulatory  body,
             does not state your name, does not confirm the amount of money
             being made available to you from the third party's funds, does
             not confirm that the money can be transferred to the UK".

          ii. the bank statements,

             ".....you have provided are not acceptable  because  they  are
             for an account that does not state your name as having  access
             to the funds".

         iii. the third party declaration,

             "...you have submitted is not acceptable because it  does  not
             contain your signature".

          iv. the letter from Mr Subramaniam Srikanthalingam,

             "...you have submitted  is  not  acceptable  as  it  does  not
             confirm the number, place of issue  and  dates  of  issue  and
             expiry of Mr Gali Reddy Sanga's identity document".

 5. The Secretary of State went on to explain that as  a  result  of  these
    omissions she was unable to award Mr Sanga any points under Appendix A:
    Attributes; accordingly his  application  was  refused.   It  was  this
    decision which was the subject  of  an  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  It appears to have been accepted by the  Tribunal  that  the
    documentation which had originally been supplied to  the  Secretary  of
    State by Mr Sanga with his application was defective to the extent  set
    out in the decision letter.  However, the Tribunal identified that  the
    key matter which it considered had to  be  determined  was  whether  Mr
    Sanga had access to sufficient  funds.   The  Tribunal  concluded  that
    despite the omissions in the documentation it  was  satisfied  that  Mr
    Sanga did have access to sufficient funds,  stating  at  paragraph  25,
    "...it seems to me that the appellant has provided a  substantial  body
    of material to show that he did have access to the  funds  of  no  less
    than �50,000 and so in my judgment ought to be entitled to  the  points
    (25) that he has sought".

 6. In relation to some of the  documentation  originally  supplied  by  Mr
    Sanga with his application the Tribunal made these observations:

         "27. It is extraordinarily difficult to  see  how  someone  in  the
             appellant's  shoes  could   really   satisfy   some   of   the
             requirements  that  were  apparently  set  for  him   by   the
             respondent, for example Mr Subramaniam could not  confirm  the
             number, place of issue, dates  of  issue  and  expiry  of  the
             appellant's  father's  identity   document   given   that   Mr
             Subramaniam was in this country and the father  was  obviously
             abroad.

         28.  As regards the situation with the bank and the fact  that  the
             appellant's name is not stated there as being someone to  have
             access to the funds, this is a matter  that  the  bank  cannot
             deal with anyway and frankly this  ought  to  have  been  seen
             properly by the respondent before framing the  Rules  in  this
             matter."

 7. The Tribunal went on to say that if its approach  to  this  matter  was
    erroneous then it would allow the appeal  on  the  basis  that  it  was
    satisfied that Mr Sanga had sufficient funds.  Any refusal of leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant would infringe his Article  8
    ECHR rights to private life in the United Kingdom to the extent that it
    would be disproportionate.  The Tribunal explained the matter in  these
    terms:

         "31. If I am wrong in that approach and analysis which seems to  me
             really deals with the basic  mischief  in  this  case  and  is
             rooted in being practical and realistic, but if I am wrong  in
             that approach, it does seem to me that the appellant does have
             a right to respect for his private life.  That right has  been
             interfered with in a sufficiently marked and  substantial  way
             by the decision of the respondent such as to engage Article 8.
              It seems to me that  applying  the  appropriate  five  stages
             under   Razgar   that   the   interference   is    indeed    a
             disproportionate one.

         32.  I say that principally because the plain and  simple  fact  of
             the matter is that the appellant does have access to  the  sum
             of �50,000 and that is really what the respondent ought to  be
             looking for in relation to this type of application under Tier
             1.  It is simply unreasonable to be  expecting  applicants  to
             provide documents in a form, by way of example, that the banks
             will simply not produce.  That would lead to an utterly absurd
             impasse."

 8. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the basis that the Tribunal were not entitled to ignore the
    accepted omissions in the  documentation  originally  submitted  by  Mr
    Sanga and reach its own  conclusion  about  the  sufficiency  of  funds
    available to him.  Rather, the Tribunal had to determine the matter  on
    the basis of that documentation, such that if it did  not  comply  with
    the provisions of paragraph 41-SD then it was  obliged  to  refuse  the
    appeal.  Furthermore, the Tribunal was not entitled to make up for  any
    perceived lack of fairness in the strictures of the points-based system
    by allowing the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds.   In  any  event  the
    Tribunal's reasoning of Article 8 was inadequate and failed  to  comply
    with the steps required to be considered under Regina v SSHD  ex  parte
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

 9. Ms Choudhry of Counsel, who appears on behalf of Mr Sanga, accepts that
    the documentation  provided  by  Mr  Sanga  did  not  comply  with  the
    requirements of paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A in the manner set out  in
    the decision letter of 13 June 2013.  However, she submits to us as she
    did before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that  the  Secretary  of  State,
    thereafter the First-tier Tribunal  and  ourselves,  can  look  at  the
    reality of the matter and on the basis of the documentation  which  was
    provided conclude that Mr Sanga did have access to the necessary funds.
     In those circumstances she submits that the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    entitled to overturn the decision of the Secretary of State and  we  in
    turn should uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

10. In support of  her  submission  she  submits  that  it  would  be  very
    difficult, if not impossible, that the third party declaration could be
    compliant with the paragraph 41 SD of Appendix  A  in  that  the  third
    party was at all material times in India, whilst Mr Sanga  was  in  the
    United Kingdom and thereby it would not have been possible for one  and
    the same document to contain  both  signatures.   In  relation  to  any
    documentation emanating from the bank,  she  submits  that  it  is  not
    possible to dictate to the bank what  information  it  records  on  its
    documents.  She submits that for these reasons the focus of enquiry for
    the Secretary of State and the Tribunal should be  whether  in  general
    terms the evidence is sufficient to establish that Mr Sanga had  access
    to the relevant funds.

11. In Alam & Others v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 960, the Court of  Appeal  said
    that the effect of Section 85A  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 was that a Tribunal is obliged to consider the question
    of compliance  with  the  points-based  system  on  the  basis  of  the
    documentation provided by an applicant with his application and was not
    entitled  to  remedy  omissions  in  that  documentation  with  further
    evidence made available  at  the  hearing.   At  paragraph  45  of  the
    decision Lord Justice Sullivan said this:

         "...I endorse the view expressed by the Upper Tribunal  in  Shahzad
         (paragraph 49) that there is no unfairness in  the  requirement  in
         the PBS that an applicant must submit with his application  all  of
         the evidence necessary to  demonstrate  compliance  with  the  Rule
         under which he seeks leave.  The Immigration Rules and  the  policy
         guidance and the prescribed application form all make it clear that
         the prescribed documents must be submitted with the application and
         if they are not the application will be  rejected.   The  price  of
         security consistency and predictability is a  lack  of  flexibility
         that may well result in 'hard' decisions in  individual  cases  but
         that is not a justification  for  imposing  an  obligation  on  the
         Secretary  of  State  to  conduct  a  preliminary  check   of   all
         applications to see whether they are  accompanied  by  all  of  the
         specified documents, to contact applicants where this  is  not  the
         case,  and  to  give  them  an  opportunity   to   supply   missing
         documents..."

12. There is a reflection of those observations in the more recent case  of
    SSHD v Rodrigues & Others [2014] EWCA Civ 2 which was  considering  the
    extent to which the "evidential flexibility policy" can afford or ought
    to afford flexibility to the Secretary  of  State,  and  in  particular
    Tribunals, in overcoming defects or omissions in documentation provided
    in support of immigration applications.  At paragraph 92  Lord  Justice
    Davis said this:

         "...Taken overall, the evidential flexibility  process  instruction
         is demonstrably not designed to give an applicant  the  opportunity
         first to remedy any defect or  inadequacy  in  the  application  or
         supporting documentation so as to save the application from refusal
         after substantial consideration."

13. In the present case the arguments which were presented on behalf of  Mr
    Sanga by Ms Choudhry were clearly sufficient to persuade the First-tier
    Tribunal that the real question in the case was  whether,  in  reality,
    the evidence was sufficient to satisfy the Secretary of State  that  Mr
    Sanga had access to these funds.  With great respect we  cannot  accept
    that that was the  correct  approach.   It  is  clear  that  since  the
    inception of the points-based system,  it  is  the  provisions  of  the
    system which have to be complied with in respect  of  any  applications
    made under  it.   The  system  is  indeed  strict  and  the  evidential
    requirements set out in paragraph  41-SD  of  Appendix  A  are  strict.
    However, the fact that it is strict does  not  in  our  judgment  allow
    Tribunals to ignore those strictures and simply deal with the situation
    as it sees fit on the merits of whether the evidence taken as  a  whole
    can provide sufficient assurance that the  funds  are  available  to  a
    particular applicant.

14. Moreover, there was not only no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal
    to support the matters urged by Ms Choudhry, but upon being pressed  in
    argument it became clear that Ms Choudhry accepted that given  time  it
    was  perfectly  possible  for  Mr  Sanga  to  have  complied  with  the
    evidential requirements  set  out  in  paragraph  41-SD.   However  she
    submitted that the reason that time would not allow that  to  occur  in
    this case was that a previous application for leave to stay as a Tier 1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant had been refused on 18 April 2013.  Although  we
    have no evidence  about  the  reasons  for  its  refusal,  Ms  Choudhry
    appeared to accept the Secretary of State's assertion that  the  reason
    given by her  for  the  refusal  of  the  first  application  was  non-
    compliance with  another  aspect  of  the  evidential  requirements  of
    paragraph  41-SD.  It  was  submitted  by  Ms  Choudhry  that  in   the
    intervening period there simply was  no  time  for  Mr  Sanga  to  have
    travelled to India in order to effect compliance with the  third  party
    declaration. For our part we  cannot  see  that  that  was  necessarily
    required, in order to effect  compliance.   In  any  event  we  do  not
    consider that that  would  provide  sufficient  justification  for  the
    Tribunal not to require compliance with paragraphs 41-SD of Appendix A.
     The reality is that there was no impossibility or undue difficulty  in
    effecting compliance with the evidential requirements.  As Ms  Choudhry
    accepted it is perfectly possible, given time,  that  these  provisions
    can be complied with and the reality  is  that  Mr  Sanga  should  have
    ensured that he made a sufficiently timely application so that he could
    comply with the provisions.

15. We consider that in reality what the First-tier Tribunal  has  done  in
    this case is to seek to effect a "near-miss" type of approach in  order
    to justify allowing the appeal, in that because it considered that  the
    requirements of paragraph 41-SD were overly strict it would ignore  the
    omissions in the documentation which had originally been  submitted  by
    Mr Sanga and instead reach its own conclusions as to the sufficiency of
    his funds on the evidence before it.  It may be that the  Tribunal  was
    not referred to the Alam case, nevertheless in approaching  the  appeal
    in this manner, it fell into error.  Moreover, although  there  may  be
    cases in which the circumstances are such that Article 8  private  life
    considerations have to be considered, this was not one of them.   There
    was no evidence, over and above his failure to obtain leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant because of  his  failure  to  comply
    with the points-based system, which would have justified  the  Tribunal
    holding that there had been a  disproportionate  interference  with  Mr
    Sanga's Article 8 right to private life in the United Kingdom.  In this
    regard reference can be made to the speech of Lord Carnwath in Patel  &
    Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC  72  at
    paragraph 57 where he said:

         "It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power.  It is to be distinguished from the Secretary  of
         State's discretion to allow leave to remain outside the rules which
         may be unrelated to any protected human right.   The  merits  of  a
         decision not to depart from the rules are not reviewable on appeal:
         section 86, sub-Section 6.  One may  sympathise  with  Sedley  LJ's
         call in Pankina for 'common sense' in the application of the  rules
         to graduates who have been studying in the United Kingdom for  some
         years (see paragraph 47 above).  However,  such  considerations  do
         not by themselves provide grounds of appeal under article  8  which
         is concerned with private or family life, not  education  as  such.
         The opportunity for a promising student to complete his  course  in
         this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in  itself
         a right protected under article 8."

    It is apparent that the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  in  any  event
    consider the matter in the staged approach set out in Razgar.

16. We do not consider that the Tribunal would have been entitled  to  take
    the view in this case that any private life considerations  would  have
    justified the First-tier Tribunal in allowing  Mr  Sanga's  appeal  and
    overturn the decision of the Secretary of State.  Accordingly, and  for
    the reasons that we have given, we allow this appeal and set aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  We remake the decision and dimiss
    the appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State  set  out  in
    the decision letter dated 13 June 2013.
