                                  Decision

   1. This matter appears before me the appellant having been granted  leave
      by First Tier Tribunal Judge Gotham on 5th March 2014 in the following
      terms:

      "1.   By a determination promulgated on 14 February  2014,  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge  Doyle  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  a
      decision of the respondent. As the judge referred to in his  paragraph
      8, the outcome of this appeal is dependent on whether the "6 year rule
      "subparagraph (ha) of paragraph 245ZX of the rules  refers  simply  to
      the accumulated total of time spent in this country with  leave  as  a
      student (as the respondent argues) or whether the calculation of the 6
      years referred to is more complicated  than  that  (as  the  appellant
      argues).

      2.    Realistically,  the  grounds  on  which  the   appellant   seeks
      permission to appeal do not seek to suggest that he could  succeed  by
      reference to human rights law issues.

      3.    Although the grounds effectively seek to re-run the  appellant's
      argument that failed before the judge, it is my assessment that  those
      grounds are arguable. In particular, I take into account that  in  the
      Upper Tribunal determination referred to by the judge  -  Islam  (Para
      245X(ha): five years' study) [2013] UKUT 00608 (IAC), circulated on  5
      December 2013. the tribunal apparently considered relevant guidance of
      the respondent dated July 2012 (see paragraphs 12 on of Islam) but, as
      the grounds suggest,  it  may  be  that  the  respondent's  subsequent
      guidance dated October 2013 calls for the revisiting of  some  of  the
      principles set out in Islam (at least in so far  as  those  principles
      are relevant to the outcome of this appeal).

      4.   The appellant should not take this grant  of  permission  as  any
      indication that the appeal will ultimately be successful."


   2. There is argument that the findings of fact as made by the First  Tier
      Tribunal judge were incorrect, they are found at paragraph 11f of  his
      determination of 14th February 2014 and read as follows:

      "11.  I find that the material facts relevant to this  appeal  are  as
      follows -

      (a)   The appellant entered the UK in 2004 to pursue a course of study
      at Heriot Watt University.  The appellant was granted leave to  remain
      in the UK as a student from the 1 September  2004  until  30  November
      2008.  In  November  2008  the  appellant  graduated  with  a  BSC  in
      Information Systems.
      (b)   The respondent granted the appellant leave to remain in  the  UK
      as a post study worker from 14 January 2010 until 14 February 2012.

      (c)   The respondent granted the appellant leave to remain in  the  UK
      from 14 August 2012 until 3 October 2013 to pursue a  Masters'  degree
      in Business Information Technology at Edinburgh, Napier University.

      (d)    The period from 4 September 2004 until 30 November  2009  is  5
      years, 2 months and 28 days.  14 August 2012 until 3 October 2013 is 1
      year, 2 months and 16 days.

      (e)     On 2 October 2013, the appellant made an application for leave
      to remain in the UK for a period of 12 months  to  pursue  a  Masters'
      degree at Stirling University.
      (f) In September 2013, the  Appellant  commenced  studying  towards  a
      Masters' degree at Stirling University.  On  31st  October  2013,  the
      respondent refused the appellants application for leave to remain.

      (g)  the  Appellant  suspended  his  degree  course  at  Herriot  Watt
      University for its third year from 2006 to 2007 and resumed studies in
      the year 2007 to 2008.

      (h) The Appellant, between August 2004 and June 2013, has had leave to
      remain in the UK as a student for 6 years, 6 months and 14 days.



   3. The Appellant challenged the refusal on the basis that  the  grant  of
      leave to remain which he is seeking will not lead to him having  spent
      more than 6 years in the UK as a Tier 4  (General)  Migrant  or  as  a
      Student, studying courses at degree level or above.


   4. The Appellant argued that the computation of time "spent" as a Tier  4
      (General) Migrant or as a student, studying courses at degree level or
      above should be achieved by calculating the  actual  period  of  leave
      granted in such category and making deduction  for  periods  when  the
      student was not studying, as prescribed by paragraphs 106  and  94  of
      the relevant Guidance. In particular a year during which period he had
      "dropped out" of studying.


   5. The Appellant's further argument is that his actual period of study in
      the UK was 9 months in each academic session as there was usually a  3
      months period in each 12 months session presumably accounting for  the
      usual Holiday period.   Alternatively that a discount of  at  least  2
      months must be deducted as prescribed by paragraphs 106 and 98 of  the
      Guidance.

   6. Mr Jibowu argued the 2 matters, firstly that a year spent not studying
      during the period when the appellant had  study  leave  ought  not  to
      count. He offered circumstances within the grounds where there may  be
      injustices where the whole period of leave was counted  where  it  had
      not been taken up such as sickness.  That  was  not  present  in  this
      appellants case, and it  does not  alter  the  plain  wording  of  the
      decision in Islam at paragraph 11;

      "The appellant had leave as a student for 4 years to pursue his degree
      course; that he chose to 'drop out' (and not inform UKBA of that fact)
      does not deny that the whole of the period of  leave  (excluding  pre-
      and post-course leave granted under para 245ZY(b)) counts towards  the
      maximum 5 year period and whatever he chose to do in that  period,  he
      did it during a period of leave as a student.  It is the period of the
      leave and not the actual study which is the  measure  for  calculating
      the period spent in the UK imposed by para 245ZX(ha)."


   7. It is clear therefore that in following the decision in Islam on  this
      point the Tribunal Judge made no error of law.  Since  the  period  of
      leave granted until October 2013 was 6 years 5 months and 14  days  as
      the Tribunal Judge correctly calculated it would be necessary for  the
      Appellant to succeed in both areas, i.e. the deduction  of  the  "Drop
      out" year and the deduction of the various incorporated leave  periods
      (amounting on Mr Jibowu's submissions to  16  months)  to  succeed  in
      demonstrating that the overall period of leave as properly  calculated
      would remain below 6 years. This is because, when an addition year  as
      requested is added the total leave granted would be 7 years  5  months
      and 14 days, from which the deduction of 16 months (if it were  proper
      to allow it) would leave .6 years 1 month and 14 days and  thus  would
      exceed 6 years.


   8. Mr Jibowu also submitted that the period of  study  should  have  been
      reset from January 2010  any period before then not  counting  towards
      the 6 year maximum (which would reduce the student  leave  accumulated
      by 5 years or so) because the Appellant was granted leave to remain to
      do post study work. That  argument  relies  upon  below  degree  study
      having a lifetime limit of 3 years and different language  being  used
      at the time in the guidance for post  study  calculations.  I  do  not
      accept that argument, the language of the rules and guidance is  clear
      and there is no indication that the indention of the  drafter  was  to
      allow a period of leave for post study work to  reset  the  period  in
      respect  of  post  graduate  study,  the  language  may  be   slightly
      different, it is however equally clear.


   9. There is therefore no error of law within the decision of the Tribunal
      Judge and the appeal is dismissed
