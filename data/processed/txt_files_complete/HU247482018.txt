                          DECISION AND REASONS (R)

   1. The hearing before me on 22nd June 2021 took the form of a remote
      hearing using Microsoft Teams. Neither party objected.  I sat at the
      Birmingham Civil Justice Centre. I was addressed by the
      representatives in exactly the same way as I would have been if the
      parties had attended the hearing together.  I was satisfied: that no
      party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as there has been any
      restriction on a right or interest, it is justified as necessary and
      proportionate.  I was satisfied that it was in the interests of
      justice and in accordance with the overriding objective to proceed
      with a remote hearing because of the present need to take precautions
      against the spread of Covid-19, and to avoid delay.  I was satisfied
      that a remote hearing would ensure the matter is dealt with fairly and
      justly in a way that is proportionate to the importance of the case,
      the complexity of the issues that arise, and the anticipated costs and
      resources of the parties.  At the end of the hearing I was satisfied
      that both parties had been able to participate fully in the
      proceedings.


The Background


   2. The appellant is a national of Albania. On 20th September 2018 he made
      an application for entry clearance to the UK as the fiancï¿½e of Luljeta
      Zekthi, who is in the UK with refugee leave.  The application was
      refused by the respondent for reasons set out in a decision dated 23rd
      November 2018.  The respondent relied upon paragraph 320(11) of the
      immigration rules which provides that entry clearance should normally
      be refused where the applicant has previously contrived in a
      significant way to frustrate the intentions of the rules.
      Additionally, the respondent concluded that the application fell for
      refusal on grounds of suitability and that the eligibility
      relationship requirements and English language requirements were not
      met.


   3. The appellant's appeal against that decision was dismissed by First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Ali for reasons set out in a decision promulgated
      on 15th October 2019.  Judge Ali found that the appellant had not met
      the requirements for leave to enter set out in Appendix FM because at
      the date of application, the appellant had not passed an English
      language test.  He accepted however that the appellant had provided a
      copy of an IELTS certificate confirming the appellant has passed A1 of
      the CEFR in speaking and listening, albeit that certificate postdates
      the application.


   4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ali also found that the appellant and
      sponsor are in a genuine relationship, and that for the purposes of
      paragraph E-ECP.2.8, the appellant is seeking entry to the UK to
      enable his marriage to the sponsor to take place.  First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Ali also considered whether the application should be refused
      under paragraph 320(11) of the immigration rules and concluded that it
      should not, having considered the explanation provided by the
      appellant for his previous presence in the UK and the matters leading
      to a conviction in February 2016, and his subsequent voluntary return
      to Albania in December 2016.


   5. The appellant was granted permission to appeal the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Ali by Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce on 7th November
      2020.  I found there to be an error of law in the decision of the
      First-tier Tribunal for reasons set out in my decision promulgated on
      12th May 2021. I noted that the findings made by Judge Ali had not
      been challenged by the respondent and those findings were preserved.
      I directed that the matter be listed for a resumed hearing for the
      decision to be re-made in the Upper Tribunal.


   6. The only ground of appeal available to the appellant is that the
      respondent's decision is unlawful under s6 of the Human Rights Act.
      Article 8 is plainly engaged.  I find that the decision to refuse the
      appellant leave to enter may have consequences of such gravity as
      potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.  I accept that the
      interference is in accordance with the law, and that the interference
      is necessary to protect the legitimate aim of immigration control and
      the economic well-being of the country.  The issue in this appeal, as
      is often the case, is whether the interference is proportionate to the
      legitimate public end sought to be achieved.


   7. Mr McVeety, rightly in my judgment, accepts that although the
      requirements of the immigration rules were not met by the appellant as
      at the date of the application for entry clearance, based upon the
      preserved findings of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ali, the requirements
      are now met.


   8. I have had regard to the public interest considerations set out in
      s117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  As set out
      by the Court of Appeal in TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109,
      compliance with the immigration rules would usually mean that there is
      nothing on the Secretary of State's side of the scales to show that
      the refusal of the claim could be justified. At paragraphs [32] to
      [34], the Senior President of Tribunals confirmed that where a person
      meets the rules, the human rights appeal must succeed because
      'considerable weight' must be given to the respondent's policy as set
      out in the rules.

   9. Having regard to the policy of the respondent as expressed in the
      immigration rules, and in the absence of any countervailing factors in
      the public interest that weigh against the appellant, I am satisfied
      that on the facts here, the decision to refuse leave to enter is
      disproportionate to the legitimate aim of immigration control.  In the
      circumstances I allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

Notice of Decision


  10. The appeal is allowed on Article 8 grounds outside the immigration
      rules.

Signed   V. Mandalia                Date 22nd June 2021


 Upper Tribunal Judge Mandalia


FEE AWARD

I decline to make a fee award.  The appellant did not satisfy the
requirements of the immigration rules at the date of his application and it
was open to the respondent to refuse his application under the immigration
rules.  The appellant has since provided evidence that post-dates the
decision, that establishes that the rules are now met, and his appeal has
succeeded on that basis outside the immigration rules.
