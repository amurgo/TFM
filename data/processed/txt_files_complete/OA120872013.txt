Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M B Hussain, Solicitor, Zahra & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the decision  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse her entry clearance as the spouse  of
    a person present and settled here. The First-tier Tribunal did not make
    an anonymity direction, and I do not consider that such a direction  is
    warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The application was made on 4 February 2013, and it was refused  on  29
    April 2013.  The  application  was  refused  on  the  ground  that  the
    appellant had not shown that she met the financial requirements.   From
    the evidence provided, her sponsor's gross income from  his  employment
    with Hillside Tandoori was �18,720 per annum.  But his bank  statements
    until 3 September 2012 showed deposits of �360 per week whereas his pay
    slip showed (net) earnings of  �293.46.   The  ECO  was  therefore  not
    satisfied as to the  veracity  of  the  sponsor's  claimed  employment.
    Furthermore, the appellant had not included a  contract  of  employment
    between the sponsor and Hillside Tandoori.  This document was specified
    in Appendix FM-SE, and had to be provided.

 3. In the grounds of appeal, the appellant's solicitors noted that it  was
    accepted by the respondent that the sponsor's annual income of  �18,720
    exceeded the required  �18,600  threshold.   The  explanation  for  the
    deposit of �360 into the sponsor's account up until  3  September  2012
    was that the sponsor had assumed that this was what he  needed  to  do.
    He had personal savings, and he had deposited the exact amount  of  his
    gross earnings each week.  This was an honest mistake on the advice  of
    third parties.  When he realised it was not the correct advice, he  had
    stopped depositing �360 each week (and had started depositing only  the
    net amount that he received each week).

 4. The sponsor was now providing two P60s.  One P60 represented his salary
    from Hillside Tandoori for the period 2 July 2012 to 16  January  2013,
    and the other represented his salary from 16 January 2013 to  the  year
    end.  If the respondent had any doubts, he should check the information
    with HMRC. His contract of employment had not been included as  it  was
    not a requirement under the Rules.

 5. On 9 July  2014  an  Entry  Clearance  Manager  gave  his  reasons  for
    upholding the refusal decision despite the grounds of appeal,  and  the
    additional evidence which had been served by way of  appeal.   While  a
    contract of employment was not required under the Rules,  the  ECO  was
    not satisfied with  the  overall  veracity  of  the  sponsor's  claimed
    employment.  Following further research and  information  available  in
    the public domain, he agreed with the  ECO  that  a  clear  and  cogent
    picture of the sponsor's employment and income from  Hillside  Tandoori
    had not been provided.  There was no record  of  the  business  on  the
    Companies  UK  website.   There  was  also  no  up-to-date  independent
    evidence from HMRC in support of the sponsor's  employment  or  of  the
    existence of his claimed employer.

 6. He noted that two P60s had been provided for the tax year ending  2013.
    But it was not clear why  if  the  sponsor  was  employed  by  Hillside
    Tandoori as claimed, he had two  P60s,  both  of  which  had  different
    employer names.  Nor was it clear why if the sponsor had been  employed
    since April 2008 as claimed earning the stated salary, the  P60s  would
    show in combination an annual income which was well  below  the  income
    threshold.  In the absence of further evidence to support the sponsor's
    claimed income, he was not satisfied  the  documentation  provided  was
    reliable evidence of the sponsor's employment and income.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. For the purposes  of  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    appellant's solicitors compiled  an  appellant's  bundle  containing  a
    detailed witness statement from the  sponsor  in  which  he  sought  to
    address the concerns and apparent anomalies raised both  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and the Entry Clearance Manager.   He  explained  his
    employment history with Hillside Tandoori.  He started working for them
    in  April  2008,  as  evidenced  by  the  accountant's  letter  in  the
    respondent's bundle.  On 1 April 2012 he had left this  employment  (as
    evidenced by the P45 in the respondent's bundle), and had  returned  to
    Bangladesh to marry his wife.  He had come back from Bangladesh  on  30
    June 2012, and had resumed employment with Hillside Tandoori.  At  that
    time, the owner of the restaurant was Mr Mannan.  On  17  January  2013
    Hillside Tandoori came under new ownership and management of  Mr  Aziz.
    This explained why he had been issued with two P60s for  the  tax  year
    ended April 2013.  What he said was confirmed by an HMRC  letter  dated
    20 January 2014 at page 1 of the appellant's bundle.  He  continued  to
    work for Mr Aziz  at  Hillside  Tandoori.   As  evidence  of  this,  he
    referred the Tribunal to the employer's accountant's letter at  page  7
    of the appellant's bundle, and to the P60 for the tax year ended  April
    2014 at page 8.  The genuineness of the P60, if there  was  any  doubt,
    was confirmed by HMRC in its letter dated 15 May 2014 at page 2 of  the
    appellant's bundle.

 8. In his subsequent determination, Designated Judge Shaerf held that  the
    sponsor had not shown any  source  of  income  for  the  twelve  months
    preceding the appellant's application or the decision under  appeal  to
    show that his earnings were in excess  of  those  referred  to  in  the
    letter of 20 January 2014 from  HMRC.  The  letter  gave  a  figure  of
    �11,880 for the year ending 5 April 2013.  The decision was  made  less
    than four weeks after the end of the tax year so that even taking  into
    account the increased salary said to have been paid for  the  tax  year
    ending 5 April 2014 and the letter of 15 May 2014,  the  appellant  had
    not shown the sponsor met the relevant income requirements  imposed  by
    the Rules.  The judge went on to observe that there was no  explanation
    of the source of the funds for the weekly payments of �360 shown in the
    sponsor's bank statements during 2012.  The judge  concluded  that  the
    evidence did not show that  before  the  application  the  sponsor  was
    earning not less than the minimum of �18,600 per annum.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 9. The appellant's solicitors applied for permission  to  appeal,  arguing
    that the judge had misdirected  himself  in  law  or  had  ignored  the
    evidence that the appellant had not worked continuously throughout  the
    tax year ending 5 April 2013.  The judge was also wrong to say that  no
    explanation had been provided as to why the  bank  statements  in  2012
    showed a weekly deposit of �360.



The Grant of Permission to Appeal

10. On 24 November 2014  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Macdonald
    granted permission to appeal, holding that  the  grounds  disclosed  an
    arguable error of law.

The Rule 24 Response

11. On 5 December 2014  John  Parkinson  of  the  Specialist  Appeals  Team
    settled a Rule 24 response on behalf of the respondent.   The  evidence
    was clearly inadequate to establish the level of the claimed employment
    and remuneration.  The bank statements did not demonstrate  payment  of
    the claimed income.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

12.  After  reviewing  the  documents  in  the  respondent's   bundle   and
    appellant's bundle with the parties, I was satisfied that an  error  of
    law was made out such that the decision should be set aside and remade.
     I gave my reasons for so  finding  in  short  form,  and  my  extended
    reasons are set out below. I  received  further  submissions  from  the
    parties on the topic of how  the  decision  should  be  remade,  and  I
    reserved on this issue.

Reasons for Finding an Error of law

13. Judge Shaerf proceeded on the premise that the sponsor needed  to  show
    that his earnings for the tax year ending 5 April 2013  were  at  least
    �18,600, whereas the letter from HMRC dated 20 January  2014  confirmed
    net earnings for the tax year of �11,880 (�13,226.40 gross).

14. The premise upon which the judge preceded was wrong  for  two  reasons.
    Firstly, the earnings in question did not  relate  to  a  twelve  month
    period, but only to the sponsor's earnings  from  1/2  July  2012  (the
    first payslip is dated  8  July,  week  14).  Nowhere  in  the  judge's
    findings is there an acknowledgement in the evidence that  the  sponsor
    had ceased working for Hillside Tandoori on 1 April 2012, as  evidenced
    by the P45, and had purportedly resumed his employment  with  the  same
    restaurant on 1 July 2012.

15. Secondly, in order to prove the sponsor's level of salaried  employment
    in the UK, an  applicant  only  has  to  provide  pay  slips  and  bank
    statements covering a six month period prior to the date of application
    where the sponsor has been employed by their current  employer  for  at
    least six months (see paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE).

16. Although there had been a change of  ownership  of  the  restaurant  in
    January 2013, the  trading  name,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the
    appellant's employment, and his place of work remained the same. So the
    sponsor fell to be treated as a person who had  been  employed  by  his
    current employer for at least six months as at the date of application.



17. Also, contrary to the judge's finding, it was  not  the  case  that  no
    explanation had been advanced for the deposits of �360 per week in  the
    bank statements between July and September 2012.  The sponsor had given
    an explanation in his witness statement.

18. As is apparent  from  the  contents  of  the  refusal  notice  and  the
    subsequent ECM review, the core issue in the appeal was not whether the
    sponsor appeared from the specified documents to be earning  in  excess
    of �18,600 gross per annum as at the date of application/decision  (the
    ECO answered this question in the affirmative, save for the  identified
    anomaly over the deposit of �360 not �293.46 each week) but whether the
    documents truly reflected the  underlying  reality.  It  was  precisely
    because this was the core issue (genuine or fictitious employment at  a
    gross salary per annum of �18,720) that the ECM invited the sponsor  to
    provide additional evidence by way of appeal to establish the truth  of
    the claimed employment. So procedural  fairness  required  an  adequate
    engagement with the additional evidence which the sponsor had provided.

The Remaking of the Decision

19. Mr Nath did not seek to cross-examine the sponsor on his evidence,  and
    he was content that I should remake the decision on the documents.

20. I find that the sponsor has addressed most of the credibility  concerns
    raised by the Entry Clearance Officer and the Entry Clearance  Manager,
    but not all of them.  There is  a  disparity  between  the  information
    given in the payslips and the earnings confirmed by HMRC. If the  gross
    earnings figure for the tax year to April 2013 is divided by  360,  the
    result is that the sponsor worked for 36.74 weeks in the tax year.  But
    according to the payslips he started working in week  14,  and  so  the
    total number of weeks worked in the tax year was 39 (52 weeks minus  13
    weeks).  If so, his total earnings by the end of the  tax  year  should
    have been higher.  Alternatively,  dividing  the  HMRC  figures  by  39
    produces a weekly wage which is lower than �360 gross, and  lower  than
    an annual gross salary of �18,600.

21. Neither the ECO nor the ECM took the point that the  employer's  letter
    submitted with the  application  did  not  include  all  the  specified
    information. But in the light of the above anomaly  it  becomes  highly
    significant that the employer's letter does not  specify  the  date  on
    which  the  sponsor  resumed  employment  in  2012.  The   accompanying
    accountant's letter merely says he resumed employment in July,  without
    saying when in July.

22. The issue raised in the Rule 24 response with regard to the appellant's
    compliance with the requirement  to  produce  the  specified  documents
    referred to in paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE is whether  the  appellant
    has complied with sub-paragraph (c),  which  required  her  to  provide
    personal bank statements corresponding to the same periods as  the  pay
    slips, "showing that the salary has been paid into an  account  in  the
    name of the person".  It is argued in the Rule  24  response  that  the
    appellant's appeal fell to be refused in any event as the personal bank
    statements up to 17 September 2012 did not show  the  sponsor's  salary
    being paid into his account.  I am constrained to agree.  Although  the
    sponsor has provided an explanation  for  paying  in  an  amount  which
    corresponds to his gross weekly wage, the  bank  statements  up  to  17
    September 2012 do not show his salary, which was paid net of tax, being
    paid into his bank account. So the appellant has failed to comply  with
    a mandatory requirement.
