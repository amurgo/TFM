               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr T D Ruddy, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    McGrade, promulgated on 10 January 2017, dismissing his appeal  against
    refusal of asylum.

 2. The facts of the case which are specific to the appellant are in little
    dispute.  The appellant was threatened by loan  sharks  in  Hanoi  from
    whom he had borrowed a sum of  money.   The  amount  was  not  entirely
    clear, but was agreed in the UT to be of the order of �10,000.00,  plus
    exorbitant interest; enough to maintain the interest  of  the  lenders,
    but not a conspicuously large sum in terms of a nationwide industry  of
    illegal lending.  He moved about 400 kilometres away  to  stay  with  a
    relative, where the loan sharks tracked him down and assaulted him.  He
    then moved to Saigon.  A friend there told him that his photograph  was
    on display in pawn shops and money lending  shops,  with  an  offer  of
    money for information about his whereabouts.

 3. The question before the UT is whether the FtT erred,  as  a  matter  of
    law, on sufficiency of protection or on internal relocation.

 4. The FtT found at �35 - 38 that there was little information before  him
    on sufficiency of protection, only a response to a country  information
    request at F1 of the respondent's bundle, and found that the  appellant
    did have access to  a  justice  system  and  that  although  there  was
    corruption it was not so endemic as to prevent that.

 5. Mr Ruddy stressed that the information at F1 shows widespread  problems
    in Vietnam arising  from  criminal  money-lending;  that  a  government
    minister admitted limited  capacity  of  law  enforcement  agencies  to
    prevent crime; and a deputy director of police said in early 2011  that
    crimes in the field of finance were on the  rise.   He  said  that  the
    judge's conclusion at �35 was not supported by the partial quotation at
    �35 from item F on the illegality of loan-sharking, or by item F  as  a
    whole.

 6. The background material cited at item F shows serious problems  arising
    from usury, but also that it is illegal and that  the  government  does
    prosecute.  The appellant supplied no other  material.   I  uphold  the
    submission  for  the  respondent  that  the  material  was  capable  of
    supporting the judge's conclusion, and that the  reasons  he  gave  are
    legally sufficient.

 7. The judge  found  at  �39  -  40  that  the  case  failed  on  internal
    relocation.

 8. The appellant raised no issue of "undue harshness";  the  question  was
    whether the risk extended throughout Vietnam.

 9.  Mr  Ruddy  founded  upon  the  appellant  having  been  traced  at   a
    considerable distance, and on the evidence of further  pursuit  at  the
    other end of the country.

10. The judge pointed out at �40 that Vietnam is a  country  of  almost  90
    million people and of 310,000 square kilometres, and that the appellant
    left in March 2015.   He  was  not  satisfied  that  the  lenders  were
    sufficiently well organised to trace the appellant wherever he might go
    in the country.  That was a  decisive  conclusion  reached  for  cogent
    reasons, and not shown to have involved the making of any  error  on  a
    point of law.

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

12. The FtT decision says  in  its  heading,  "anonymity  direction  made",
    although no direction appears in the body of the decision.  The  matter
    was not addressed in the UT.  Anonymity has been preserved herein.
