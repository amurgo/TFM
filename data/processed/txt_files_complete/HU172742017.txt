               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Turner, Counsel instructed by Hubers Law
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal brought with permission, following the setting  aside
    by  the  High  Court  of  the  Upper  Tribunal's  original  refusal  of
    permission to appeal against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which, after a hearing on 23 February 2018 at Hatton  Cross,  dismissed
    the appellant's human rights appeal.

 2. This case involves another of the large number of decisions made by the
    respondent pursuant to paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration  Rules  to
    refuse leave to remain to a person on the basis that it  is  considered
    that that person behaved dishonestly; either in under-declaring tax  to
    Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, or in inflating his  or  her  income
    for the purposes  of  obtaining  previous  leave  to  remain  from  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department.

 3. The  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Smith  notes  that  the
    appellant applied for leave to remain in  2011  based  on  his  claimed
    income of �35,765, which meant he met the relevant income  requirements
    under the points-based system rules  for  leave  to  remain.   However,
    through his accountant, the appellant had  declared  to  HMRC  that  he
    earned only a third of that amount -  some  �11,266  -  over  the  same
    period.

 4. The respondent's case was that the appellant had acted  dishonestly  in
    over-declaring   his   income   in   his   points-based    application.
    Alternatively, that he had under-declared his income to HMRC.

 5. The appellant said that his under-declaration to HMRC was  an  innocent
    mistake at the hands of his then accountant.  He  had  been  honest  in
    respect of his 2011 application.

 6.  Having set out the relevant law the  judge  at  paragraph  22  of  the
    decision turned to the burden and standard of proof.  The  judge  noted
    correctly that it was for the respondent to establish deception on  the
    balance of probabilities standard and that if the  respondent  provided
    evidence to demonstrate deception, then an evidential burden shifted to
    the appellant to provide a plausible  innocent  explanation,  which  if
    done shifted the evidential burden back to the respondent.

 7. The judge noted the evidence which was both  in  written  and  in  oral
    form.  The oral evidence came from the appellant.  The written evidence
    consisted of various documents.  In particular, there was a letter from
    his then accountants, called MSCO.  The first of the letters from  MSCO
    dated 21 March 2011 is described by the judge as follows:-

         "It does not feature a salutation and it is not clear  to  whom  it
         was addressed.  It appears to be in response  to  a  query  seeking
         some form of financial  reference  for  the  Appellant.   ...   The
         operative part of  the  letter  states  when  the  Appellant's  tax
         liabilities for the 2010/11 tax  year  will  be  payable  ("January
         2013").  It states that the Appellant  became  self-employed  on  7
         April 2010.  It concludes with a warning, identical to the  closing
         paragraph of the second letter  [to  which  the  judge  would  make
         reference  shortly],  refusing  to  take  responsibility  for   the
         contents of the letter."


 8. The second letter to which the judge referred was dated 27 April  2016.
    This was not addressed to anyone and was in the style of  "to  whom  it
    may concern".  The judge considered it necessary  to  quote  from  that
    letter and we do the same:


         "During the tax year 2010-2011, Mr Karim's income from all sources,
         which include employment and self-employment, was for the amount of
         �35,794.  However, due to clerical error on our  behalf  [sic],  we
         failed to declare his income from self-employment.   As  a  result,
         his total income for the year 2010-2011 on the HMRC  record  showed
         only �13,824.


         Our client approached us in the beginning of 2015 as to inquire his
         actual tax return for the year 2010-2011 [sic],  when  we  realised
         that an error was made by us and thereafter we advised him to amend
         his tax return through his current accountants.


         Whilst the information provided above is believed to be true, it is
         provided  without  acceptance  by  MSCO   of   any   responsibility
         whatsoever and any use you wish  to  make  of  the  information  is
         therefore, entirely at your own risk."


 9. The judge noted at paragraph 29 of  his  decision  that  there  was  no
    indication as to who the authors of the letters were.   He  also  noted
    that nobody from the accountants had attended  to  give  evidence.   We
    will come back to that matter in due course.


10. The judge noted at paragraph 30 that the appellant produced a record of
    interview with the respondent  and  it  was  noted  that  there  was  a
    recording of "credible" in that printout.

11. At paragraph 31,  the  judge  dealt  with  the  oral  evidence  of  the
    appellant. In cross-examination, the appellant said he did not complain
    to a professional regulatory body about the errors committed  by  MSCO.
    He spoke to them about what had happened but did not feel he needed  to
    take the matter further and he had accepted their mistake.  He  neither
    sought nor received any compensation from them.  He was content to have
    the letter acknowledged and was said to be "really happy" with the  way
    MSCO had dealt with the situation in 2016.  He did not want to upset  a
    professional.


12. Nevertheless, as the judge noted at paragraph 32, the appellant changed
    to a firm called ABC Accountants in  2013,  on  the  recommendation  of
    friends; and this firm also produced a letter to the judge.


13. The appellant told the judge about the family life he enjoyed with  his
    wife in the United Kingdom.

14. The judge's findings begin  at  paragraph  34.   The  judge  noted  the
    significant  discrepancy  identified  by  the  respondent.   The  judge
    considered it to be of importance.  Either  way,  the  judge  said  the
    discrepancies stood to benefit the appellant.  They either resulted  in
    a more favourable treatment of  his  immigration  application  than  he
    deserved, or, alternatively, they resulted in a  significant  reduction
    of his tax liabilities.  The magnitude of the sums involved  attracted,
    according to the judge, a corresponding expectation that  a  person  in
    the appellant's position would have paid extra special attention to the
    information he gave to the respondent and HMRC respectively.

15. The judge noted at paragraph 36 that  it  was  not  necessary  for  the
    respondent to establish which of the two possible deceptive  activities
    occurred.  It was sufficient that one or other must have occurred.   In
    all the circumstances, the judge considered that the evidential  burden
    had shifted to the appellant and it was therefore necessary to consider
    the appellant's explanation.

16. At paragraph 39, the judge considered the letter of 27 April 2016  from
    MSCO.  Applying the starred determination in Tanveer  Ahmed  the  judge
    found that he could place no weight on that  letter.   It  was  in  the
    judge's view not reliable.  It was not clear who had authored it.   The
    sender did not attend the Tribunal to give  evidence,  which  would  be
    expected, in the judge's view, in a matter of this gravity.  There  was
    no written confirmation from the author as to why he or she was  unable
    to attend.

17. At paragraph 40, the  judge  noted  additional  documentation  said  to
    support the letter but that the judge found that this documentation was
    marred  by  grammatical  errors  which   called   into   question   its
    reliability.  The judge also considered  it  significant  that,  again,
    this letter stated that the writer, whoever that might be,  was  unable
    to accept responsibility for its contents.  In the  circumstances,  the
    judge did not consider  that  it  was  possible  to  place  significant
    reliance on this letter either.

18.  The  judge  noted  at  paragraph  42  that  the  appellant  had  taken
    undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, the postgraduate  degree  being
    an MBA.  The judge found the appellant to be educated and  intelligent.
    "In light of his clear skills and abilities, including in the field  of
    business, I  am  not  persuaded  that  the  Appellant's  then  lack  of
    experience with the tax system in this jurisdiction would have resulted
    in this error going undetected by him".


19. At paragraph 43, the judge noted  the  appellant's  oral  evidence  and
    considered whether it was capable of alleviating the  concerns  he  had
    expressed.  The judge was not persuaded that it did.   The  judge  took
    into account the ease with which the appellant could have  taken  steps
    to support his account and verify the reliability of the document.

20. The judge noted at paragraph 44 that HMRC had not charged the appellant
    a penalty fee for the late payment of tax.  The judge explained why  in
    his view that was not a matter that had  any  material  effect  on  the
    appeal.

21. The judge noted at paragraph 46 the fact that, as previously  noted,  a
    caseworker for the respondent, having interviewed  the  appellant,  had
    recorded him in the printout as "credible".  The judge said: "The  fact
    that a Home Office interviewer  annotated  his  account  as  'credible'
    simply means that  an  individual  civil  servant  had  no  credibility
    concerns arising from the  interview  itself".   The  judge  went  onto
    expand upon that reasoning.

22. The judge also  noted  an  argument  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  at
    paragraph 47.  This was that the appellant had drawn attention  to  the
    fact that his earnings in the years that followed 2011 were at the rate
    of the 2010 declaration.  If he artificially inflated his  income  when
    declaring it to the Home  Office  in  2010  how,  the  appellant  asked
    rhetorically, could he have earned the same amounts  in  the  following
    years?

23. The judge considered there were two reasons why that argument  did  not
    shift the evidential burden back  to  the  respondent.   First,  having
    secured leave through inflating his earnings in 2010, it was  plausible
    that the appellant would  have  used  the  foundation  that  the  over-
    declaration provided as a basis upon  which  to  establish  himself  in
    employment and self-employment such that his income was able  later  to
    reach that level.  Secondly, his earnings may well have  been  at  that
    level, but led the appellant to under-declare to  HMRC.   Overall,  the
    judge did not consider that the appellant had discharged the evidential
    burden that had shifted to him.  In any event even if it had, the judge
    would overall, as paragraph 49 makes plain, have  been  satisfied  that
    the respondent  had  discharged  the  "return  burden",  as  the  judge
    described it.

24. Having found those matters in favour of the respondent, the judge  then
    turned as was required in the human rights appeal to other  aspects  of
    the appellant's claim. However, for the reasons given in the paragraphs
    that followed, the judge did not conclude that the appellant had  shown
    that the human rights decision in this case  was  wrong  and  that  the
    refusal of his human rights claim was not permitted by reference to the
    legislation and the ECHR.

25. An application for permission to appeal was filed and that was  refused
    in the First-tier Tribunal.  An application was  then  renewed  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman on 8  June  2018  refused
    permission to appeal, the challenge being that the  judge  should  have
    granted an adjournment when it became clear in his  mind  that  he  had
    concerns over the letter to enable the writer of the letter,  the  firm
    of accountants to attend.

26. There was then a challenge to Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman's refusal of
    permission brought by way of judicial review in  the  High  Court  that
    resulted in the High Court granting permission.  We have seen today the
    grounds of application, which included the  challenge  that  the  judge
    should have granted an adjournment.  They also included  the  challenge
    pursued by Mr Turner  today,  that  the  findings  of  the  judge  were
    irrational.

27. Mr Turner submitted that  the  judge's  analysis  of  the  accountant's
    letters was overly forensic.  He pointed to case law which he said  was
    supportive of his case.  This case law is R (on the application of Khan
    v SSHD) [2018] UKUT 384, a decision of Martin Spencer J sitting in  the
    Upper Tribunal, and Williams v SSHD JR/10532/2017, a decision of  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Canavan.

28. There is the following point to make about  both  of  those  decisions.
    They  arose  in  immigration  judicial  review  proceedings.   In  such
    proceedings, the task of the appellant is to show, according to  public
    law  principles,  that  the  decision  of  the  respondent  (which   by
    definition is not subject to appeal) is wrong in law.

29. In the present case and in stark contrast, we have  an  appeal  brought
    against a refusal to accept a human rights claim.  That  appeal  turned
    to a significant extent upon  whether  the  appellant  was  rightly  or
    wrongly denied leave by reason of the Immigration Rules.  That in  turn
    involved a forensic examination by a judge, making primary findings  of
    fact, as to whether the appellant had in effect acted dishonestly.  The
    judge's findings of fact therefore stand  as  the  decision  which  the
    Upper Tribunal must analyse.  Mr Turner faces a high hurdle in  showing
    that the judge was not rationally entitled to reach the  findings  that
    he did.

30. So far as the MSCO letters are concerned, although Mr  Turner  did  not
    major on them in oral submissions to us, he did succeed in obtaining  a
    judicial review on behalf of the appellant, on the basis that the judge
    should have adjourned the proceedings for the reasons  that  Mr  Turner
    gave.

31.  We have no hesitation in dismissing that aspect of  the  challenge  to
    the judge's decision.  It should have been manifest  to  the  appellant
    and his advisers that to rely upon the letter of 27 April 2016 from the
    accountants, read with the letter of 21 March 2011, was  likely  to  be
    regarded by any judicial factfinder as  problematic.   The  problematic
    nature of those letters is  brought  out  by  the  judge.   The  matter
    therefore was a classic Tanveer Ahmed issue.  A person  came  before  a
    fact- finding  body  with  a  document  which  that  fact-finding  body
    concluded was not reliable.  There  was  no  obligation  on  the  fact-
    finding body in the circumstances of this case  to  indicate  that  the
    document was in its  view  not  reliable  and  give  the  appellant  an
    opportunity to call oral evidence to support it.  On the contrary, that
    was something which should have been in the mind of the  appellant  and
    his advisers to do if they saw fit. They did not.   Accordingly,  there
    is no valid criticism of the judge's decision on this issue.

32. Nothing of materiality can  be  derived  from  the  findings  of  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Canavan in the case  of  Williams.   This  is  not  just
    because that case involved a judicial review, as opposed to an  appeal.
    It is also because, if one reads the  judgment,  it  is  manifest  that
    there were other unusual features of the case which do not  feature  in
    the present one.

33. In the present case, the judge made his own  findings  of  credibility.
    He came to the conclusions that we have mentioned earlier.   The  judge
    explained why, in circumstances of this  case,  the  recording  on  the
    printout  at  the  interview  that  had  resulted  in  the  finding  of
    "credible" was in no sense determinative of the  matter.   The  judge's
    findings are adequately reasoned and should stand.

34. So far as the case of Khan is concerned, it is instructive to  look  at
    paragraph 37 of that judgment.  Mr Whitwell  urged  us  to  do  so  and
    suggested that it is illuminating to compare the guidance  set  out  by
    Martin Spencer J in that case with what the  judge  did  in  this  one.
    Taking first the issue  whether  there  was  a  significant  difference
    between the income claimed in  a  previous  application  for  leave  to
    remain and income declared to HMRC, Mr Whitwell pointed out, as we have
    already  recorded,  that  the  difference  in  this  case  was   indeed
    significant.  Was the Secretary of State presented  with  a  case  that
    indicated that there had not been dishonesty but only carelessness?  If
    so, then Khan indicates it is the Secretary of  State's  task  to  make
    relevant findings.

35. In the present case, for reasons we have seen, the Secretary  of  State
    came to a conclusion in this case that there had been dishonesty.  This
    being an appeal, the judge undertook his own fact-finding task. For the
    reasons we have given, his analysis is not to be criticised.  So far as
    the third aspect of the Khan guidance is concerned, which turns on  the
    standard of proof, again, for the reasons  we  have  given,  the  judge
    committed no error there either.

36. Fourthly, Martin Spencer J in Khan stated  that  simply  to  blame  the
    accountant for the error in respect of the tax return would not be  the
    end of the matter: "far  from  it".   That  essentially  was  what  the
    appellant had sought to do in the present case.  The  judge  considered
    the appellant's case but found that he not  discharged  the  evidential
    burden.  Again, there is no reason to find error in that  part  of  the
    judge's decision.

37. As for the requirement in Khan for  there  to  be  a  consideration  of
    evidence pointing in both directions, that is precisely  what  happened
    here.  The judge did consider the appellant's case both orally  and  in
    writing and for the reasons given the case was rejected.  Again,  there
    is no error there.

38. The remaining parts of the Khan guidance seem to us to take matters  no
    further insofar as this particular case is concerned.


39. Accordingly, drawing these threads together, the challenge made against
    the judge's decision fails.  It fails by reference to  the  submissions
    advanced by Mr Turner today, with his customary care, and it also fails
    by reference to  the  written  grounds  of  judicial  review  challenge
    (assuming  they  are  relevant),  and  by  reference  to  the  previous
    challenges  to  the  decision  brought  by  way  of  applications   for
    permission to appeal.


40.  There is, accordingly, no error of law in the judge's decision such as
    to require that decision to be set aside.  This appeal  is  accordingly
    dismissed.
