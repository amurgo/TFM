               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A McVeety Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr Symes instructed by Diplock Solicitors.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Randall ('the Judge') promulgated on 9  April  2020,
         in which the Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights
         grounds.
      2. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-tier
         Tribunal, the operative part of the grant being  in  the  following
         terms:

         "1.  The Appellant seeks permission to appeal in  time,  against  a
            decision  of  First-tier   Tribunal   (Judge   Randall)   dated
            09/04/2020, whereby it dismissed the Appellant's appeal against
            the Secretary of State's decision to refuse his application for
            leave to remain on the basis of 10 years continuous residence.


         2.   It is argued that Counsel at the  hearing  before  IJ  Randall
            wrongly conceded Article 8 grounds, without instructions.  This
            is misleading. Counsel  did  not  concede  Article  8  grounds.
            Counsel did not pursue  them,  which  is  a  different  matter.
            Different counsel has drafted a permission application.


         3.   None of the grounds is arguable, save that  the  Tribunal  may
            have misinterpreted/misapplied the decision of Basnet 2012 UKUT
            113 and/or Ahmed 2018 UKUT 00053 (see  para.32).  The  Tribunal
            may have wrongly distinguished those cases on the basis that an
            incorrect fee had been paid rather than no fee. The  issue  was
            not only whether the Respondent had discharged  the  burden  of
            proof as to whether the correct fee had  been  paid  given  the
            previous decisions of the First-tier and Upper Tier,  to  which
            no reference is made in the grounds. No consideration was given
            as  to  whether  the  Respondent  given   the   Appellant   the
            opportunity to pay the shortfall and his evidence was  that  he
            believed the correct fee had been paid.


         4.   Only the ground stated  is  arguable.  There  is  an  arguable
            material error of law."


Error of law

      3.  Directions  were  given  by  the  Upper  Tribunal   providing   an
         opportunity for the parties to file written submissions in relation
         to the  proposed  method  of  disposal  and  in  support  of  their
         respective cases. No response was received from  the  Secretary  of
         State. The relevant  parts  of  the  written  submissions  received
         behalf of the appellant from Mark Symes of Garden  Court  Chambers,
         dated 5 August 2020, are in the following terms:

         'Purported restriction on the grounds granted permission


         3.   The FTT permission decision purports to restrict  the  grounds
            upon which permission to appeal was  granted.  However,  it  is
            submitted that the asserted  restriction  is  ineffectual.  The
            head note to Safi [2018] UKUT 388 (IAC) states


                "(1) it is essential for a judge who is granting  permission
                to appeal only limited grounds to say so, in terms,  in  the
                section of the standard  form  document  that  contains  the
                decision, as opposed to the reasons for the decision."


         4.   However, here


              - The Decision is plainly that part of Judge Fords notice of 4
                May  2020,  which  is  above  the  sharp  emboldened   line:
                "permission to appeal is granted."


              - Whereas the Reasons for the decision are plainly, the  words
                beneath the same line.


         5.    Thus  the  stated  restriction  of  the  permission  granted,
            illegitimately  found  within  the  reasons  rather  than   the
            decision element, is ineffectual. Permission to  appeal  should
            be accepted as granted on all grounds.


         Submissions on the merits


         6.   In the premise A submits that FTTJ Randall's decision dated  9
            April 2020, dismissing his appeal is flawed by  material  error
            of law and should be set aside.


         Submissions on The First Ground


         7.   Although the FTT decision is relatively  long  and  elaborate,
            the real issue is a short one.


         8.   A's material immigration history  is  essentially  as  follows
            (the correct interpretation of the events at (a) is contested):


             a) A entered the UK on 10 September 2009 as a student; his lead
                was extended until 7 April 2013. Three applications in short
                succession beginning with one on 6 April 2013 with untreated
                as failing by R: the first two were rejected for invalidity,
                the third refused on its merits.


             b) A lodged an appeal against the third  refusal  (3  September
                2013), which  was  allowed  on  31  January  2014  by  Judge
                Wiseman, applying the principles in CDS Brazil  [2010]  UKUT
                305   (IAC),   which   showed   that   the    refusal    was
                disproportionate,  in  that  it   arose   from   essentially
                technical reasons which interrupted the  legitimate  studies
                of a person of good  character  who  should  be  allowed  to
                complete his education in the UK (AB39 [30]);


             c) A was granted leave to remain from 2  May  2014  to  1  July
                2014, in recognition of Judge Wiseman's decision: however  A
                was unable to find a new Sponsor during this period, and his
                application of 1 July 2014 was refused on 19  January  2015,
                carrying a right of appeal, which he  duly  exercised:  that
                appeal was allowed by Judge Mill for the FTT on 25 May 2016,
                on the basis that R had acted unfairly  in  allowing  A  too
                little time within which to find a new Sponsor and  complete
                the related immigration  formalities  (AB50-51  [10-15]).  R
                pursued an appeal against this decision  to  the  UT,  Judge
                Mailer accepting on 12 May 2017 AB59  that  Judge  Mill  had
                been wrong to suggest he could give effect to  his  thinking
                by requiring a grant of leave of the 120 days: the period of
                leave was  a  matter  for  the  SSHD  although  Judge  Mills
                substantive reasoning on unfairness was upheld.


             d) R then deliberated on the outstanding July 2014  application
                for some time, before writing to A on 11 September 2019 AB61-
                62 to inform  him  that  his  application's  reconsideration
                would now be suspended for 60 days.


             e) On 4 October 2019 A  made  the  application  for  indefinite
                leave to remain AB65ff, the refusal of which, on 27 November
                2019 AB75ff leads to the present appeal.


         9.   The dispute between the parties as to the First Ground  is  as
            to the consequences of events in Spring 2013.


             a) A submits that he has held leave to remain at  all  material
                times: R bears the burden of proof and  does  not  establish
                that  A's  application  of  6  April   2013   was   invalid.
                Accordingly A has held leave from 10  September  2009  until
                the present date. He held his original  student  leave  from
                September  2009  until  April  2013;  as  the  SSHD  is  not
                established that the April 2013 rejection was  lawful,  that
                application remained outstanding thereafter,  bringing  with
                it the concomitant extension of leave under s3C IA 1971 that
                applies to any timely outstanding application. Thereafter at
                all material times A has had either  an  application  or  an
                appeal outstanding.


             b) R's case in the November 2019 refusal, essentially upheld by
                Judge Randall in the FTT on appeal, is that A's  April  2013
                application was invalid leaving him  with  a  break  in  his
                leave from when his prior leave  expired  on  7  April  2013
                until 2 May 2014 when he was granted further  leave  with  a
                view to implementing Judge Wiseman's decision.


         10.  Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 424 explains the paradigm  case  for  the
            purpose of analysing invalidity decisions and section 3C  leave
            - i.e. one where asserted technical  invalidity  (such  as  the
            lack of the appropriate fee)  in  a  first  application  ("A1")
            causes the SSHD to treat a person as an overstay, and thus  not
            to consider it appropriate to  notify  them  of  appeal  rights
            regarding a second applications refusal ("A2"):


                "Section 3C (1)-(2) of the  Immigration  Act  1971  provides
                that, where an application to vary leave to remain  is  made
                during  the   currency   of   existing   leave,   leave   is
                automatically extended until  that  application  is  finally
                disposed of: I refer to this as "3C leave". Accordingly,  if
                the Secretary of State was indeed not entitled to reject A1,
                [the appellant] still enjoyed leave to remain at  the  point
                that he lodged A2 and is entitled to a right of appeal after
                that. The result is that whether there is a right of  appeal
                against the refusal of A2 depends on  the  validity  of  the
                rejection of A1".


         11.  The burden of proof in establishing invalidity is on the  SSHD
            where the missing information as  to  the  payment  history  is
            within the SSHD's knowledge:


             a) The President in Basnet [2012] UKUT 113 (IAC0 {27}:


                   "We turned to the question of who  bears  the  burden  of
                   proving that an application has been validly  made.  This
                   would normally fall on the applicant, who would discharge
                   it by producing evidence of acknowledgement of receipt or
                   proof of postage. Here the application  was  received  in
                   time, but the question of whether it was  accompanied  by
                   accurate  billing  data  can  be  answered  only  by  the
                   respondent. In those circumstances, we conclude that  the
                   evidential burden of demonstrating that  the  application
                   was  not  "accompanied  by  such  authorisation  (of  the
                   applicant or other person purporting  to  pay),  as  will
                   enable the  respondent  to  receive  the  entire  feeding
                   question" must fall on the respondent."


             b) The head note to another Presidential panel decision  states
                in Ahmed [2018] UKUT 53 (IAC):


                   "(3) Whether the Secretary of State ultimately discharges
                   the legal burden of proof will depend on the  nature  and
                   quality of evidence she is able to provide, having regard
                   to the timing of any request for payment details and  the
                   reasons for the  delay,  balanced  against  any  rebuttal
                   evidence produced by an appellant."


         12.  A's case before the FTT was that the  April  2013  application
            was a valid one with appropriate payment  authority  (see  e.g.
            the summary of his witness statement  6(ii)).   Notwithstanding
            the Basnet clearly places the burden of proof on all issues  on
            A [39].


         13.   There were several respects in which the evidence before  the
            FTT  was  uncertain.  The  evidence   overall   was   "somewhat
            contradictory"  [41],  neither  party,  provided  the  original
            application form [42], the SSHD  failed  to  produce  the  GCID
            notes for the vital application [42]  (or  the  other  material
            mentioned [32]); and all of this arose in a context  where  R's
            advocate did not cross-examine A on how much he  authorised  to
            be taken from his bank account [43].


         14.  All those are factors which would tend to  prevent  the  party
            bearing the burden of proof from vindicating  their  case.  Yet
            there is no indication that the FTT was alive to the  potential
            lack of clarity in the evidence being more of a problem for the
            SSHD than for A. So plainly the misdirection is a material one.


         15.  Indeed R has twice failed to provide evidence to discharge the
            burden where it was in issue (see [22] of the 27  January  2014
            appeal at AB38, which  was  in  the  18  months  where  payment
            records are retained). This led to a finding  of  fact  at  [10
            (iii)] in the second appeal AB50  that  A  had  discharged  his
            burden.


         16.  As submitted before the FTT [28], notably A was  permitted  to
            pursue  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  September  2013
            notwithstanding that, on the SSHD's present case, A, would then
            have been an overstay since April 2013. Section  82  NIAA  2002
            read over this period:


                "82 Right of appeal: general


             1) Where an immigration decision is made in respect of the
                person he may appeal to the tribunal.


             2) In this Part "immigration decision" means - ...


                   (d) Refusal to vary a person's leave to enter or remain
                   in the United Kingdom if the result of the refusal is
                   that the person has no leave to enter or remain.


         17.  Accordingly A would have only have  been  able  to  pursue  an
            appeal against the September 2013  refusal  of  his  June  2013
            application, at he held leave at that time, prior to  September
            2013, terminating it: otherwise it  would  not  have  been  his
            applications refusal, but his  prior  status  as  an  overstay,
            which resulted in his lack of leave. So the acceptance of  both
            SSHD and FTT that there was jurisdiction to bring  the  appeal,
            culminating in Judge Wiseman's decision strongly  supports  A's
            submissions that  he  intrudes  should  have  been  treated  as
            holding section 3C leave given the nature  of  the  April  2013
            "rejection". Thus the existence of the earlier right of  appeal
            was itself a relevant factor:  yet  the  FTT  left  it  out  of
            account.


         Submissions on The Second and Third Grounds


         18.  A's advisers confirm in their  letter  (immediately  following
            the UT grounds under the covering  letter  of  22  April  2020,
            providing the IAF-4 form) that their counsel below,  Mr  Malik,
            was not instructed to  concede  any  issues  generally  arising
            under the Human Rights Convention.


         19.  A notes that the FTT purporting to refuse permission  on  this
            point to a distinction between the concession of a  ground  and
            its non-pursuit. A submits that this is a distinction without a
            difference. Either way, the conduct of counsel, rather than  an
            advised tactical decision, led  to  A's  claim  only  partially
            being put before the  FTT.  As  is  clear  from  the  statement
            provided by those instructing counsel  at  the  relevant  time,
            unfortunately Mr Malik went beyond (or, more  accurately,  fell
            short of) his instructions in failing to pursue A's case beyond
            the argument on which Ground 1 above is founded.


         20.  The FTT erred in law in failing to consider the  propriety  of
            the concession for itself. It  simply  repeats  the  concession
            [57] and adopts it. The terms in which it does  so  are  rather
            unclear due to the incompleteness of the phrase "or  any  other
            of the rules re article..." in the FTT's final sentence.


         21.  The Presidential decision  in  Carcabuk  &  Bla  cited  in  IM
            (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 626 notes that it is  "important  to
            identify the precise nature of any so-called  concession".  Yet
            there is no indication here that the FTT applied its  own  mind
            to the ambit of the propriety of the concession.


         22.  A submits that this was a material error of law.  If  accepted
            as such, then clearly the heads of claim that went unventilated
            below should be considered now. They were matters  that  should
            not have been conceded and which the FTT should have  at  least
            considered taking of its own  motion  under  its  own  Robinson
            jurisdiction to apply its mind to obvious points arising  under
            the Human Rights Convention. Further and  alternatively,  there
            are matters which the UT should  consider  taking  of  its  own
            motion  under  the  Robinson  principles;  and/or  because  the
            concession was made without authority. Given one of A's appeals
            had previously succeeded  on  CDS  Brazil  grounds,  the  self-
            evident nature of the point is readily apparent.


         23.  Those grounds essentially raise two distinct avenues by  which
            the appeal could have  succeeded  on  Human  Rights  Convention
            grounds even were the First Ground rejected:


             a) On via the CDS Brazil avenue: i.e. that a  student  of  good
                character whose educational and professional connections are
                such as to constitute "private life" in the  UK,  and  whose
                course of studies is frustrated, for reasons  outside  their
                control, should have a reasonable and effective  opportunity
                to complete their studies in  the  UK,  and  a  decision  on
                technical  grounds  to  the  contrary  is   likely   to   be
                disproportionate to the interference with their private life
                that will otherwise ensue;


             b) One via the line of authorities from AG Kosovo [2007]  UKIAT
                00082 to MM (Lebanon)  [2017]  UKSC  10,  holding  that  the
                policies of the SSHD are a relevant benchmark  by  which  to
                measure the proportionality  of  interference  with  private
                life, and thus that the failure  of  the  SSHD  to  consider
                exercising discretion by reference to the  discretion  found
                in the Long Residence guidance, viz a viz the break of leave
                from  April  2013  until  May  2014  was  relevant  to   the
                proportionality of the decision. The Guidance stated in  the
                version in force at the time of the November 2019 decision:


                   [Vis-�-vis] "an applicant who had overstayed by more than
                   28 days before 24 November 2016 ... you must consider any
                   evidence of exceptional circumstances ...  The  threshold
                   for what constitutes 'exceptional circumstances' is high,
                   but could include the delays resulting from unexpected or
                   unforeseeable causes."


            As noted by Briggs LJ in EK (Ivory Coast) [2014] EWCA Civ  1517
            [59], a decision is more likely to be materially  unfair  where
            the SS HD is responsible for the  alleged  unfairness.  In  any
            analysis, it seems that the most likely cause for the feet mix-
            up in April 2013 was the change in  fees  on  the  day  of  A's
            application,  a  matter  for  which  the  SSHD   arguably,   or
            responsibility. Indeed, these days (though not in  April  2013)
            the SS HD's published policy is to give a second opportunity to
            pay a fee: see  Guidance  Applications  for  leave  to  remain;
            validation, variation and withdrawal (Version 2.0; 30  November
            2018):


                "If an applicant has not paid  the  correct  fee,  you  must
                write to them ..., And give them 10 working days to  rectify
                their mistake."


            This policy change suggests that over time the SSHD has come to
            recognise the potential  for  unfairness  within  the  previous
            system.


         24.  These aspects of A's private life (which should have been seen
            as Robinson obvious) went unconsidered  by  the  FTT  -  it  is
            accordingly submitted that the UT should, in the  interests  of
            justice, it mixed them to be raised now, by granting permission
            to appeal and determining them. As noted in Davoodipanah [2004]
            EWCA Civ 106, it is appropriate to permit the withdrawal of the
            concession that should never  have  been  made.  The  Court  of
            Appeal. In that case, went on to hold [22]:


                "Obviously if there will be prejudice to one of the  parties
                if the withdrawal is  allowed  that  will  be  relevant  and
                matters such as the nature of the concession and the  timing
                may also be relevant, but it is not essential to demonstrate
                prejudice before an application to withdraw a concession can
                be refused. What the tribunal must do is to try and obtain a
                fair and just result."


         25.  It is submitted that there would have been no prejudice to the
            SSHD had this matter be raised before the FTT -  the  arguments
            are perfectly standard ones which Presenting Officers encounter
            regularly. And there  is  no  prejudice  now,  given  that  A's
            original grounds of  appeal,  glossed  over  by  these  written
            submissions, provide notice and the opportunity for R to  state
            her own case on the issues raised.


         26.  For these reasons it is submitted that the arguments at [23(a)
            and (b)] should be permitted to go forward to form part of  A's
            case if the UTC finds an error  of  law  in  the  decision  and
            finally determines the appeal for itself.

      4. Mr Symes' oral submissions to the Upper Tribunal were in accordance
         with his written pleadings to which Mr McVeety was able  to  reply.
         All the material provided has been  considered  with  the  required
         degree of anxious scrutiny even if not specifically referred to  in
         the body of the decision

Discussion

      5. The above  pleadings  rise  a  number  of  issues  which  shall  be
         considered in order.
      6. The first of these relates to a preliminary  issue  concerning  the
         status of the grant of permission to appeal, which  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge  purported  to  limit.  In  Ferrer  (limited  appeal
         grounds; Alvi) [2012] UKUT 00304 (IAC) the Tribunal held that:

               i) In deciding an application for permission to appeal the UT
                  a judge should consider carefully the utility of  granting
                  permission only on limited grounds. In  practice,  such  a
                  limited grant is unlikely to be as helpful  as  a  general
                  grant, which identifies the ground  or  grounds  that  are
                  considered by the judge to have the strongest prospect  of
                  success.


              ii) Where the judge nevertheless intends to  grant  permission
                  only in respect of certain of the applicant's grounds, the
                  judge should make this abundantly plain, both  in  his  or
                  her  decision  and  by  ensuring   that   the   Tribunal's
                  administrative staff send out the proper notice, informing
                   the  applicant  of  the  right  to  apply  to  the  Upper
                  Tribunal for permission to appeal on grounds on which  the
                  applicant has been unsuccessful in the application to  the
                  First-tier Tribunal;


             iii) If an applicant who has been granted permission to  appeal
                  to the UT on limited grounds only  applies  to  the  Upper
                  Tribunal on grounds in respect  of  which  permission  has
                  been refused, the Upper Tribunal  judge  considering  that
                  application should not regard his or her  task  as  merely
                  some form of review of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision
                  on the  application;


              iv) In the  IAC  the  overriding  objective  of  the  Tribunal
                  Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 is  unlikely  to  be
                  advanced by adopting a procedure whereby  new  grounds  of
                  appeal can be advanced without the permission of the Upper
                  Tribunal under rule 5 of those Rules.

      7. This guidance was further refined in Safi and others (permission to
         appeal decisions) [2018] UKUT 00388 (IAC)  in  which  it  was  held
         that:

             (i)  It is essential for a judge who is granting permission to
                  appeal only on limited grounds to say so, in terms, in the
                  section of the standard form document  that  contains  the
                  decision, as opposed to the reasons for the decision;


             (ii) It is likely to be only in very exceptional circumstances
                  that the Upper Tribunal will be persuaded to  entertain  a
                  submission that a decision  which,  on  its  face,  grants
                  permission to appeal without express limitation is  to  be
                  construed as anything other than a grant of permission  on
                  all  the  grounds  accompanying    the   application   for
                  permission, regardless  of  what  might  be  said  in  the
                  reasons for decision section of the document.

      8. The judge who granted permission, in  the  body  of  the  grant  of
         permission in this case, the reasons section, clearly set out  that
         it was a limited grant on one ground only, even though the  section
         of the standard form containing the  decision  does  not  expressly
         state this is  so.  In  Alvi  the  Upper  Tribunal  found  a  clear
         requirement that a judge granting permission on limited grounds not
         only made this clear  in  the  grant,  but  also  to  the  tribunal
         administrative staff to enable them to communicate this fact to the
         appellant. In this appeal following the grant of permission, a form
         IA68, was sent to  the  appellant,  his  representatives,  and  the
         Secretary of State's Presenting Officers Unit by email on  24  June
         2020, stating:

             "This is to  inform  you  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  has
             granted your application for permission to appeal to the Upper
             Tribunal, on limited grounds.


             The reasons for the decision are enclosed here with.


             You may apply to the Upper Tribunal for permission  to  appeal
             on a point of  law  arising  from  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
             decision on any ground on which permission has been refused.


             Please  see  the  enclosed  form  (which  includes   important
             information about time limits).

      9. The parties were clearly aware of the limited nature of  the  grant
         and of the  opportunity  to  renew  an  application  to  the  Upper
         Tribunal to seek  permission  to  appeal  those  grounds  on  which
         permission was initially refused.
     10. Directions was issued by the Upper Tribunal following the grant  of
         permission sent to the parties on 24 July 2020 in  reply  to  which
         the appellant's representatives sent an email dated 25 July 2020 in
         response stating "It seems that permission was  previously  granted
         on a limited grounds. We however have not received any decision yet
         since we made an application for permission on 22  April  2020.  We
         will be very grateful if you could provide us with the decision  of
         granting the permission at your earliest convenience as we have  to
         submit  further  submissions  by  6  August  2020  as   per   above
         direction." A copy of the grant was sent to the  solicitors  on  28
         July 2020.
     11. Further directions issued by the Upper Tribunal on 30 December 2020
         included the following paragraph:

             "The appellant applied for  permission  to  appeal  the  FtT's
             decision. Permission to appeal was granted by a Judge  of  the
             First-tier Tribunal, Judge Ford, on 4 May 2020. While  in  the
             reasons there is reference to a limitation  of  the  grant  of
             permission, there  is  no  such  limitation  in  the  decision
             itself."

     12. The grant of permission whilst clearly setting out the intention of
         the judge who granted it falls foul of  the  specific  requirements
         set out by the Upper Tribunal in Safi to make  this  clear  in  the
         decision section of the grant and must therefore be  treated  as  a
         grant of permission to appeal on all grounds.
     13. In relation to the appellants claim:

    Ground 1 - Burden of Proof

     14. The appellant's contention before the Judge was that  although  the
         appellant bore the burden of making a valid application it was  for
         the respondent to establish that the application was not  valid  in
         the circumstances of this case. It was argued  the  respondent  had
         not provided any evidence to suggest that the application  was  not
         validly made, let alone produce evidence that  could  justify  from
         departure from the earlier findings of another First-tier Tribunal.
     15. There are a number of cases dealing with the relationship between a
         valid application and payment of the required fee including  R  (on
         the application of Da'Costa) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2010] EWHC 2259 (Admin) in which Judge Pelling QC  said
         that the Secretary of State had  no  discretion  in  regard  to  an
         application that did not comply with the requirements  relating  to
         fees under paragraph 21 of the Immigration and  Nationality  (Fees)
         Regulations  2007.   Furthermore,   the   Immigration   Directorate
         Instructions drew a clear distinction between an application  which
         was invalid because of non-compliance with a requirement imposed by
         the Immigration Rules and invalidity arising  from  non-payment  of
         fees  which  was  subject  to  the  2007  Regulations.  An  in-time
         application not accompanied by a fee could only be treated as valid
         if payment of the fee was waived. If an application  was  rejected,
         as in the instant case, then it could  only  be  valid  if  it  was
         resubmitted with the fee.
     16. In R (on the application of Mine and others) v Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2011] EWHC 2337 (Admin) Simons J said that
         where a specified fee had not been paid the application was invalid
         under regulation 2(1) of the  Immigration  and  Nationality  (Fees)
         2007 Regulations (paras 25 - 27).
     17. In BE (Application of Fee:  Effect  of  Non-Payment)  [2008]  UKAIT
         00089 the tribunal held that an application was  accompanied  by  a
         fee if it was "accompanied by such authorization (of the  applicant
         or other person purporting to pay) as will enable the respondent to
         receive the entire fee in question, without further recourse having
         to be made by the respondent to the payer".
     18. In Basnet  (validity  of  application  -  respondent)  [2012]  UKUT
         00113(IAC) the Tribunal held that (i)  if  the  respondent  asserts
         that an application (not an appeal) was not accompanied by  a  fee,
         and so was not valid, the respondent has the onus  of  proof;  (ii)
         The  respondent's  system  of  processing  payments   with   postal
         applications risks falling into procedural unfairness, unless other
         measures are adopted; (iii) When notices  of  appeal  raise  issues
         about payment of the fee and, consequently,  the  validity  of  the
         application and the appeal, Duty Judges of the First-tier  Tribunal
         should issue directions to the respondent to provide information to
         determine whether an application was accompanied by the fee.
     19. In Ahmed & Ors (valid application - burden of  proof)  [2018]  UKUT
         00053 in which it was held that (i)  Central  to  the  analysis  in
         Basnet (validity of application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 113 (IAC)
         is the existence of a further procedure undertaken by the Secretary
         of  State  in  order  to  process  payment  in  relation  to  which
         applicants are not privy and over which they have  no  control.  As
         such, it remains appropriate for her to bear the burden  of  proof.
         (ii) The fact that  an  invalidity  decision  was  not  immediately
         challenged may be relevant in determining whether the legal burden,
         including an initial evidential burden requiring the  Secretary  of
         State to  raise  sufficient  evidence  to  support  her  invalidity
         allegation, has been discharged. (iii)  Whether  the  Secretary  of
         State ultimately discharges the legal burden of proof  will  depend
         on the nature and quality of  evidence  she  is  able  to  provide,
         having regard to the timing of any request for payment details  and
         the reasons for any delay, balanced against any  rebuttal  evidence
         produced by an appellant.
     20. In Ved and another (appealable decisions; permission  applications;
         Basnet) [2014] UKUT 00150 (IAC) it was held that  the  findings  of
         the Upper Tribunal in Basnet (Validity of application - respondent)
         [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC) depended upon  there  being  an  appealable
         immigration decision, which in that  case  can  only  have  been  a
         refusal to vary leave to remain  within  section  82(2)(d)  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.  The  Secretary  of
         State's rejection of an application for leave as invalid is not  an
         immigration decision within section 82 of the 2002 Act  and  cannot
         as such be appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.
     21. In R (on the application  of  Woodward)  v  SSHD  [2015]  EWHC  470
         (Admin) it was held  that  when  an  incorrect  fee  was  paid  the
         application  was  invalid  under  Reg  7  of  the  Immigration  and
         Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2012. It did  not  therefore  extend
         leave under section 3C of the 1971 Act.
     22. In Das (paragraph 276B - s3C - application  validity)  [2019]  UKUT
         354 the Upper Tribunal opined that s3C could  not  apply  during  a
         period in which the application was struck  out  for  want  of  fee
         payment even if later reinstated.
     23. There is no real dispute as the to the law in this case, the  issue
         being the impact of the same on the facts of the case.
     24. It is unarguable that the appellant was not aware  of  the  reasons
         why the application of 6 April 2013 was rejected by the respondent.
         That application was for further  leave  to  remain  prior  to  the
         expiry of his previous period of leave, which ran out  on  7  April
         2013. A letter written by the UK Border  Agency  to  the  appellant
         dated 10 April 2013, which the appellant does not claim he did  not
         receive, contains the following relevant text:

             "Thank you for the attempted immigration  application.  Please
             read this letter carefully as you have not  currently  made  a
             valid application.


             The  fees  for  immigration  applications  are  prescribed  in
             Regulations. On 6 April 2013, most fees  were  subject  to  an
             increase  for  both  main  applicants  and  any   accompanying
             dependants.  The  new  fees  prescribed  for  each   type   of
             application are set out on our website. The correct fee, as in
             force at the date of application, must be paid in order for an
             application to be valid.


             Unfortunately, the appropriate new fee has not  been  received
             with this application. We do not consider that an exception to
             the requirement to pay the  fee  applies  in  this  case,  and
             therefore this application  cannot  be  considered  as  it  is
             invalid.


             We are unable to process your application (due to the old  fee
             being paid), we are returning your application  form  and  all
             supporting documents.

     25. There was no application by way of judicial review to the rejection
         of the application as invalid and as  all  the  documents  provided
         were returned to the appellant the Secretary  of  State  cannot  be
         criticised for not providing copies of  the  same  in  relation  to
         either this application or any earlier proceedings.
     26.  Mr  Symes  in  his  submissions  stated  the  appellant  had  been
         consistent in claiming he had paid the correct fee or  enabled  the
         respondent to collect the correct fee, which if such  fee  had  not
         been capable of being taken from the appellant's bank  account  may
         have created a 'Basnet' type situation where the Secretary of State
         would have been required to have provided evidence to  support  the
         contention the application was not valid.
     27. I do not find the assertion the appellant has  been  consistent  in
         his claims or provided the means to collect the correct fee  to  be
         made out.  There is merit  in  Mr  McVeety's  submission  that  the
         appellant has not been consistent in his claim that he always  paid
         the correct and there is no  earlier  judicial  finding  confirming
         this is so.
     28. In a decision promulgated on 31 January  2014  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Wiseman when referring to the application  of  6  April  2013
         wrote:

             "24.     The appellant made his first application in time;  by
                  an unfortunate coincidence it was made  on  precisely  the
                  same day that the fee for this kind of application went up
                  from �394 to �406. I believe that he sent a cheque for the
                  lesser figure having not appreciated that the  change  had
                  taken place. I presume he sent in a  cheque  (I  have  not
                  seen it) because somewhat confusingly I was  addressed  by
                  Mr Ahmed on the case of Basnet, the main  point  of  which
                  appeared to be some of the  difficulties  that  can  arise
                  when authorisation is given to the respondent to take fees
                  by way of credit card. That is not however  what  I  think
                  the appellant did in this case. However he  also  did  not
                  supply one of his English language  qualification  results
                  because he had not been able then to take it, although  he
                  shortly did."

     29. Judge Wiseman notes that the appellant made a  further  application
         on 3 May 2013, in which he sent a  cheque  for  �406  and  all  the
         necessary supporting documentation, including the English  language
         certificate which had not been available when the first application
         had been made [25].
     30. The chronology shows that rather than challenging the  reasons  the
         application  of  6  April  2013  was  declared  invalid,  which  if
         incorrect  one  would   have   thought   the   appellant   or   his
         representatives  would  have  done  to  prevent  him  becoming   an
         overstayer, the appellant  made  a  fresh  application,  this  time
         providing the correct fee.
     31. In the decision under challenge when discussing this  issue,  Judge
         Randall wrote:

             "41.     The evidence about what occurred in that 6 April 2013
                  application is  central  therefore  to  this  appeal,  but
                  remains  somewhat  contradictory.  However,  it  does  not
                  appear to be in dispute that the fee changed on the day of
                  the Appellant's application, and that the higher  fee  was
                  applicable. Amongst the sources of  evidence  I  note  the
                  following:-


                   i) The Respondent's  letter  dated  10  April  2014,  in
                      response to the application, refers to the fact  that
                      the fees had changed, and that too low a fee had been
                      proffered.  It  states  in  terms   that   no   valid
                      application was made, and that section  3  C  doesn't
                      apply to extend any leave. The letter is silent as to
                      what payment method was used, and the amount  of  the
                      shortfall.


                  ii) In IJ Wiseman's determination, which arose  from  the
                      third application, there are a number  of  references
                      to the first  application,  which  are  unfortunately
                      inconsistent as to the method of payment, on which no
                      clear finding is made:-


                        a) the grounds of appeal are  said  to  assert  that
                           credit/debit   card   details    were    provided
                           (paragraph 7)


                        b) the Appellant's appeal statement, as  summarised,
                           states that the Appellant issued a cheque for the
                           required fee (paragraph 12)


                        c) IJ Wiseman presumed that  the  Appellant  sent  a
                           cheque for a lesser figure (paragraph 24)


                 iii) In IJ Mills determination, he finds  that  the  first
                      application was  returned  notwithstanding  the  fact
                      that adequate payment details  and  information  were
                      provided (paragraph 10 (iii)).


                  iv) In Deputy Upper Tribunal Mailer's  determination,  IJ
                      Mills finding at paragraph 10 (iii)  is  recited  (at
                      paragraph 7)


                   v) In the  decision  letter  now  under  appeal,  it  is
                      maintained that the incorrect fee was offered.


                  vi) In the grounds of appeal for this  appeal,  there  is
                      reference to the fact  of  an  'incorrect  fee  being
                      submitted' not being in dispute.


                 vii) In the Appellant's appeal statement for this  appeal,
                      he refers to providing his correct bank  details  and
                      states that the Respondent was authorised to take the
                      requisite fee.


                viii) In his evidence to me he  stated  that  he  paid  the
                      correct fee.


             42.      Clearly not all of these  accounts  can  be  correct.
                  These accounts are not even consistent as to whether  this
                  was a cheque card  payment.  For  instance,  correct  bank
                  details (as asserted, were given by the Appellant at (vii)
                  in the immediately preceding paragraph), are not  relevant
                  or required if in fact a  cheque  was  sent.  Indeed,  the
                  Appellant's own account, appears to have shifted from (ii)
                  (b) above to (vii) above. The application form itself  has
                  not been provided to me by  either  party,  unfortunately.
                  Nor was I provided with any GCID notes by  Ms  Akhtar  for
                  this transaction, although she did provide  them  for  the
                  second application (stating that the cheque was  not  paid
                  by the bank).  However,  none  of  the  accounts  provided
                  suggests that the 6 April application was a case of a bank
                  refusing to honour a cheque or rejecting  a  card  payment
                  (as in Basnet). In addition, I have been provided with  no
                  evidence that suggests that the form as completed gave the
                  Respondent  authorisation  to  take   whatever   was   the
                  requisite fee at the relevant time  -  it  would  be  very
                  curious if it did. On any of  the  accounts,  (except  the
                  Appellant's oral evidence to me, and  perhaps  his  recent
                  statement), too low a fee was offered  by  the  Appellant,
                  whether by cheque or by card.


             43.      The Appellant  asserted  in  his  statement  that  he
                  completed the correct application form  and  provided  his
                  correct bank card details. He also asserts that he checked
                  them. He also asserts that there were enough funds in  the
                  bank account. However, even if that is true, (and it  runs
                  counter to IJ Wiseman's  summary  of  his  earlier  appeal
                  statement,  the  important  question  is   how   much   he
                  authorised the Respondent to take from the  bank  account.
                  His statement is silent on that point.  I  therefore  find
                  that Ms Akhtar's failure to  cross  examine  him  on  that
                  point, has less traction in the circumstances.


             44.      In oral evidence before me,  the  Appellant  asserted
                  that he sent the right application with the right fee, but
                  they told him to resubmit. He repeated this when I put  it
                  to him in terms that the amount that he offered to pay was
                  too low. I  have  not  been  provided  with  corroborative
                  evidence  that  the  Appellant's  account  of  paying  the
                  correct fee is true. This is  not  what  the  Respondent's
                  (almost contemporaneous) letter of 10 April states.  There
                  is no other material before me, that suggests that this is
                  the case. I find that the Appellant  is  not  telling  the
                  truth about this. The grounds of  appeal,  in  any  event,
                  accept that the fee offered was too  low.  Of  course,  Mr
                  Malik's submissions as to validity rely  on  me  accepting
                  the Appellant's statement and oral evidence that  he  paid
                  the correct fee (by which I mean the higher) fee.


             ...


             49.  I am thus satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that
                  the Appellant did indeed authorise the payment of the  fee
                  as part  of  his  application  dated  6  April  2013,  but
                  unfortunately it was a fee that was �12 less than what  by
                  then was required. This renders his  application  invalid.
                  If the application is  invalid,  then  section  3C  cannot
                  assist in extending  his  leave;  rather,  he  started  to
                  overstay  on  8  April  2013.  Furthermore,   Mr   Malik's
                  subsequent  careful  submissions  about  continuity  don't
                  assist the Appellant, as they rely on the validity of  the
                  6 April application as a pre-requisite.

     32. It is not made out the Judge's finding that too low a fee was  paid
         with the 6 April 2013 application, some �12 less that  required  by
         the Fees Regulations, or that as a consequence the application  was
         invalid is a finding outside the range of those  available  to  the
         Judge on the evidence. No material  legal  error  is  made  out  in
         relation to these findings.
     33. Regulation 7 Immigration and Nationality  (Fees)  Regulations  2012
         reads:

             'Consequences of failing to pay the specified fee


             7.   Where these Regulations specify a fee which must
                  accompany an application for the purposes of the 2011
                  Order, the application is not validly made unless it is
                  accompanied by the specified fee.'

     34. I reject the appellant's contention this is a Basnet type  case  in
         which the  burden  of  proof  passed  to  the  Secretary  of  State
         requiring the production of evidence beyond  that  which  was  made
         available to the Judge in establishing the correct factual analysis
         and the failure of the appellant to provide the correct fee. As the
         application  as   invalid   for   the   reasons   stated   in   the
         contemporaneous 10 April 2013  letter  there  would  have  been  no
         attempt to collect the fee.
     35. Whilst there is reference in the appellant's pleadings to the  fact
         the fee increase came into force on 6  April  2013,  which  is  not
         disputed, this is not a case in which it  has  been  established  a
         fairness argument arises on the basis the increase was a matter  of
         which the appellant had no knowledge and that  he  had  effectively
         been  "ambushed"  by  the  increase  of  which  he  had  no   prior
         notification as such information was in the public domain.
     36. On  25  February  2013  Mark  Harper  the  Minister  of  State  for
         Immigration announced proposals to change the fees for  immigration
         and nationality applications made  to  the  UK  Border  Agency  and
         services provided by the Agency for 2013-14 to come into force from
         April 2013 in a written ministerial statement laid in the House  of
         Commons on 25 February 2013 and House of Lords by Lord Taylor.  The
         written statement included a  table  of  the  proposed  fees  which
         subject to parliamentary approval (which  was  subsequently  given)
         the government intended to bring into force from 6 April 2013.  The
         correct fee the appellant should have paid  was  available  on  the
         internet, yet the fee submitted with the application  was  the  fee
         applicable for a 2012-13 application and not a post  6  April  2013
         application which this was. If this arose as a result of a  failure
         by the appellant to check the correct fee payable  that  is  not  a
         matter for which the respondent can be held responsible.
     37. I do not find the appellant has made out his first Ground. I do not
         find it made out on the facts that the burden of proof  shifted  to
         the Secretary of State. It remained upon the appellant at all times
         to establish he had made a valid application which he had not.
     38. On considering the specific context of this case, the appellant was
         aware a fee was required as he purported to provide the  same.  The
         amount of the required fee  was  in  the  public  domain  following
         publication of the increase to take effect from 6 April  2013.  The
         correct fee was not paid as confirmed in the letter from UKBA dated
         10 April 2013.  The  applicant  was  correctly  rejected  as  being
         invalid for non payment of the correct fee in accordance  with  the
         Regulations.

    Grounds 2 and 3

     39. Grounds 2 and 3 can be classed as  the  human  rights  grounds.  In
         relation the same it is important to consider the  actual  findings
         made by the Judge.
     40.  The  appellant  was  represented  before  the  Judge  by  a   very
         experienced member of the bar, who has recently taken silk, and who
         has a deserved reputation as an advocate with a good  knowledge  of
         relevant legal provisions and their applications to the facts of  a
         particular appeal.
     41. It is not disputed that in  the  original  grounds  of  appeal  the
         appellant asserted that the decision  was  contrary  to  his  human
         rights.
     42. The Judge notes at [9]:

             "It was agreed between the parties that the only issue between
             them was continuity of the Appellant's residence and therefore
             whether the requirements of the long residence rules were met.
             As indicated, Mr Malik stated that he  would  not  be  arguing
             that there were very significant obstacles to the  Appellant's
             integration in Bangladesh."

     43. At [37] the Judge, when recording submissions  made  by  Mr  Malik,
         writes:

             "I should therefore allow the appeal on human  rights  grounds
             on the basis that a provision of the  human  rights  compliant
             Immigration Rules, namely long  residence  provisions  had  in
             fact been satisfied on the balance of probabilities, and  that
             pursuant to the case of  TZ  (Pakistan)  on  that  basis,  the
             appeal should succeed."

     44. It is not made out that Mr Malik conceded that there was no Article
         8 issue to  be  argued,  as  alleged,  but  rather  structured  his
         arguments to reflect the fact that if the appellant succeeded under
         the Immigration Rules on the long residence provision he would also
         be entitled to succeed on human rights grounds.
     45. On this issue at [57] the Judge writes:

             "As to the other facts of this appeal, Mr Malik did  not  seek
             to argue that the Appellant could otherwise succeed on Article
             8 grounds; he could only succeed by way of his submission  re:
             the satisfaction of the rules for a permanent residence, which
             rely first on the validity submission discussed above. For the
             avoidance of doubt,  given  my  conclusion  on  validity,  the
             Appellant  has  not  satisfied   me,   on   the   balance   of
             probabilities, that he meets the requirements of the Article 8
             compliant rules about permanent residence, or any of the other
             rules   re   Article,   or   that   his   removal   would   be
             disproportionate."

     46. It is clear from reading  the  decision  that  as  a  result  of  a
         typographical error the number 8 has been  omitted  from  the  last
         line of the sentence of  [57]  and  no  confusion  or  legal  error
         arises.
     47. It is suggested in the grounds that the Judge was wrong to  proceed
         on this basis and should have done more but proceedings before  the
         First-tier Tribunal are adversarial by nature and no arguable legal
         error  is  made  out  in  the  Judge  relying  upon  arguments  and
         submissions made by an experience advocate as to the case they  are
         seeking to rely upon.  The  Judge  was  not  required  to  set  out
         findings in relation to each and every aspect of the  evidence  and
         clearly considered the material made available  with  the  required
         degree  of  anxious  scrutiny  which  would   have   included   the
         appellant's witness statement setting out the impact  upon  him  of
         not being able to proceed with his further studies.
     48. Mr Symes submitted that the appellant could have succeeded on human
         rights grounds on the basis of the case of CDS Brazil, in  which  a
         course of studies was frustrated for reasons outside the control of
         the appellant who was denied a reasonable and effective opportunity
         to complete their studies in the United Kingdom, but  such  factual
         matrix does not accord with the facts of this appeal. The right  to
         study does not  engage  Article  8  per  se,  and  the  reason  the
         appellant was unable to succeed and complete his studies  is  as  a
         result of his own failure in not providing the required  fee,  such
         that the application of 6 April 2013  was  valid,  which  meant  he
         became an over stayer. As Mr McVeety submitted,  if  the  appellant
         was a genuine student why had he done nothing  in  the  intervening
         period to continue his studies. It is accepted  the  appellant  may
         have wanted to obtain a degree in engineering, but he had no  basis
         for been able to do so lawfully in the  United  Kingdom  and  could
         have returned to Bangladesh to make an application to re-enter  the
         United Kingdom with lawful leave or to have continued  his  studies
         overseas.  Whilst Mr Symes in reply indicated that this was because
         the appellant had spent the intervening years trying to resolve his
         status as a finding he had overstayed could have  repercussions  in
         the future, there is merit in the assertion a genuine student would
         have done  all  he  could  to  have  continued  with  his  studies,
         elsewhere if required.
     49. In relation to the second issue, the  submission  relating  to  the
         line of authorities from AG (Kosovo) and beyond, at [23 (b)] of  Mr
         Symes written submissions, reference to policy or guidance in force
         in November 2019 does not establish that the same was in  force  at
         the relevant date of April 2013, or that there  was  a  policy  the
         failure of which would assist the appellant. The assertion that the
         most likely cause for the fee mix-up in April 2013 with the  change
         of fees on the day of the appellant's application was a matter  for
         which the respondent arguably bore responsibility is without merit.
         There is no basis for finding there had  been  a  mix-up  of  fees.
         There had been advance publication of the change of  fees  and  the
         new fee rates which had been published in tabular form and  on  the
         internet and were available to all applicants at the relevant time.
         It is the appellant's failure to pay the correct fee which  is  the
         reason for the situation in which he finds himself.
     50. It is not made out the Judge  erred  in  law  in  not  for  himself
         considering the human rights elements beyond the  submissions  made
         by Mr Malik. Further, in undertaking a  detailed  analysis  of  the
         nature of the private life and consequences of the refusal upon the
         appellant  it  is  also  not  made  out  that  in  light   of   the
         circumstances as found,  there  are  reasonable  prospects  of  the
         appellant succeeding with a human  rights  claim.  The  appellant's
         time in the UK has always been precarious warranting little  weight
         being  attached  to  it.  The  acceptance  by  Mr  Malik  that   no
         insurmountable obstacles existed was relevant, as is the fact  that
         the evidence failed to establish before  Judge  Randall  there  was
         anything of sufficient weight to outweigh the  public  interest  in
         his removal, which is the basis of the  Judge's  finding  that  his
         removal will be proportionate.
     51. In relation to the jurisdictional  point  taken  by  Mr  Symes,  it
         appears an appeal against a decision of  September  2013  proceeded
         notwithstanding on the basis of the respondent's case and the  case
         as found by the Judge, the appellant had been an  overstayer  since
         April 2013.  The argument that the acceptance by the  Secretary  of
         State and First-tier Tribunal there was jurisdiction to  bring  the
         appeal, culminating in Judge Wiseman's decision, strongly  supports
         the appellant's submission that he should been treated  as  holding
         section 3C leave is noted,  but given the nature of the April  2013
         rejection and failure to take into account that in Virk v Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 652  it  was  said
         "Statutory jurisdiction  cannot  be  conferred  by  waiver  or  120
         agreement; or by the failure of the parties or the tribunal  to  be
         alive to the point", a  decision  followed  in  MS(Uganda)  v  SSHD
         [2014] EWCA Civ 50, the failure to raise the issue of  jurisdiction
         does not  confer  statutory  jurisdiction  and  a  mistake  by  the
         Secretary  of  State's  representative  and/or  Judge  Wiseman   in
         considering the appeal without the jurisdictional  issues  adds  no
         weight to the appellant's case. On the facts there was no right  of
         appeal at that time on the law as it then stood as identified by Mr
         Symes in his written submissions.
     52. I do not find it made out  that  the  respondent  was  required  to
         exercise discretion and decide otherwise, especially  in  the  case
         where the gap in lawful residence was not the Secretary of  State's
         fault, but a consequence directly attributable to  the  appellant's
         failure.
     53. I do not find it made out the Judges  erred  in  law  in  a  manner
         material to the  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal  sufficient  to
         warrant the Upper Tribunal interfering any further in this matter.

Decision


     54. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
         decision. The determination shall stand.

    Anonymity.

     55. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
         45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
         2005.

         I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
