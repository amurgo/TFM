For the Appellants:    Mrs J Moore, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are father, mother and two  children,  all  citizens  of
    Nepal.  On or around 29th November  2012  they  applied  for  leave  to
    remain in the UK, apparently on the basis  only  of  their  family  and
    private life here.  The respondent refused  all  four  applications  by
    letters and notices all dated on or around 20th June 2013.   First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Fox dismissed  the  appellants'  appeals  against  those
    decisions by determination promulgated on 24th February 2014.

 2. The appellants'  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  may  be
    summarised as follows:

          1)      Absence of consideration of section 55 of  the  2009  Act
             (best interests of children) and,  in  respect  of  the  third
             appellant, lack of consideration of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of
             the Rules.

          2)      Lack of reasoning why on proper consideration of  section
             55 and of paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  the  appellants  were  not
             entitled to succeed on Article 8 grounds.

          3)      Lack of consideration of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) and  why
             the third appellant's appeal  should  not  succeed  under  the
             Rules.

          4) & (5)    Inadequate consideration of the Article  8  case,  it
             being insisted that the third Appellant  speaks  only  English
             and that the children have little connection with Nepal,  have
             no understanding of the language and  cannot  be  expected  to
             relocate there.

 3. These grounds were prepared by previous  representatives.   It  can  be
    observed at the outset that grounds 1, 2 and 3 overlap considerably and
    that 4 and 5 are no more than repetition of  and  insistence  upon  the
    case.  They exaggerate the difficulties for the children, in particular
    on a linguistic basis, beyond anything justified by the evidence or  by
    the judge's findings.

 4. A judge of the First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  the
    view that as the third appellant had lived in the UK  for  seven  years
    she "potentially" met the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules,  but
    the judge made no finding on that point  and  in  consequence  gave  no
    consideration to the extent which that might impact upon the  cases  of
    the other appellants.

 5. Mrs Moore submitted that there was a  "glaring  error"  of  failure  to
    analyse why the third appellant's case did not succeed under the Rules.
     She referred to the refusal letter addressed to the  second  appellant
    which sets out the requirements of E-LTRPT.2.2 in respect of a child of
    an applicant.  The third appellant in terms of  sub-paragraph  (d)  had
    lived in the UK continuously for over seven years up  to  the  date  of
    application.  Paragraph EX.1 applied.  The Home Office considered  that
    [and refused the  applications  also  on  that  basis]  but  the  judge
    mentioned it only briefly at paragraph 13: "... common  case  ...  that
    the appellants cannot meet the requirements of the Rules save  for  the
    Third Appellant meeting the seven year requirement".

 6. Mrs Moore (who of course did not appear in the First-tier Tribunal) was
    unable to say whether any argument had been developed along  the  lines
    that the third appellant met the requirements of the Rules and that not
    only  hers  but  all  the  other  appeals  should  have  succeeded   in
    consequence.  Nevertheless, she said that the determination showed that
    the point was at least mentioned and was before the judge to resolve.

 7. I observed that it is not axiomatic that seven  years  residence  as  a
    child leads to a grant of leave.  One of the  conditions  of  paragraph
    EX.1 is that "it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
    the UK".  It did not appear that there had been any submissions on  the
    issue of reasonableness in the First-tier Tribunal, other than  in  the
    overall context of the proportionality assessment.  That would  explain
    why there was no separate conclusion.

 8. Mrs Moore submitted that a decision on proportionality issue could  not
    be equated to the reasonability question within the  Rules.   She  said
    that it is established that it is never reasonable to  remove  a  child
    who has had seven years' residence.  That  would  become  enshrined  in
    statute within a few days of the present hearing, when section 117B  of
    the 2002 Act would be brought into force.

 9. I observed that section  117B(6)(b)  also  includes  the  criterion  of
    whether it would be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the  UK.
    Mrs Moore submitted again that it was clear that there  is  nothing  to
    weigh on the side of the public interest in such a case, and that it is
    already axiomatic and would be put beyond  doubt  that  no  child  with
    seven years' residence can be expected to leave the UK, that being  the
    intention of Parliament  as  well  as  the  effect  of  the  Article  8
    jurisprudence to date.

10. I indicated that I was unable to uphold that submission.  It would have
    been simple for Parliament to enact that no  child  with  seven  years'
    residence could ever be required or reasonably expected  to  leave  the
    UK.  Parliament has not  enacted  a  prohibition,  but  has  applied  a
    reasonability criterion.

11. Mrs Moore relied upon Azimi-Moayed [2013] UKUT 197 for the  proposition
    of the greater significance of seven years' residence from age  4  than
    the first seven years of live.  She pointed out that this child at  the
    date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing had been here for  about  eight
    years from the age of 2.  She had reached an age when  she  had  become
    less dependent on her parents, and was more focused on her peers.   She
    said this was not  simply  re-argument,  but  disclosed  error  of  law
    through the absence of a clear finding  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
    She accepted that factors relevant to the reasonability (if  that  were
    an issue) of expecting a child to leave might  be  similar  to  factors
    relevant to proportionality, but she maintained that did not avoid  the
    difficulty.  Lack of reasoning for an outcome under the Rules could not
    be made good by findings under Article 8.   Those  were  two  different
    issues.  She was unable to point me to any comparative  definitions  of
    the criteria of reasonability and proportionality which  might  assist.
    She said that it could not be read  into  the  determination  that  the
    judge considered it reasonable to expect the child to  leave  with  the
    rest of her family.  The judge failed to look at the distinct situation
    of the third appellant under the Rules and did  not  specifically  take
    account of the best interests of the children.  If  error  were  to  be
    found, Mrs Moore sought to introduce further evidence.

12. Before dealing with  possible  further  procedure,  I  heard  from  the
    Presenting Officer on the error of law issue.

13. Mrs Saddiq submitted that fundamentally the appellants  disagreed  only
    with the judge's assessment and did not disclose any material errors of
    law.  The determination was plainly based primarily on considering  the
    best  interests  of  the  children.   There  was  no  need   to   refer
    specifically to section 55 of the  2007  Act.   At  paragraph  15,  for
    example, the judge said that "the best interests of the  children  must
    always be considered within [the] family unit".  Any  question  of  the
    reasonability of expecting the third appellant  to  leave  the  UK  was
    subsumed into the overall balancing exercise, which was what would have
    to be done anyway.  Even if the judge had  not  explicitly  stated  the
    reasonableness test  under  paragraph  EX.1,  that  criterion  was  the
    implicit  basis  of  his  entire  determination.   His  conclusion   at
    paragraph 36 that the interference was proportionate was in effect also
    a conclusion in terms of EX.1.  The case had not been put to the  judge
    as turning firstly on the situation of the  third  appellant,  and  the
    others then hanging the case on hers.  This appeal was an attempt to re-
    state the case with a different emphasis although it had been presented
    thoroughly by competent counsel in the first instance.  The  judge  had
    considered the whole circumstances and primarily  those  affecting  the
    children.  Azimi Moayed was not authority that seven  years'  residence
    for a child was a factor overriding all other considerations.  There is
    no rule in that case or anywhere else that once a child has  been  here
    for seven years, she and her family have, without anything more  to  be
    said, acquired a right to stay.  There was no material  error  and  the
    determination should stand.

14. Mrs Moore in reply reiterated her point that the judge did not  make  a
    specific decision under the Rules nor state any reasons  and  that  was
    inadequate because an appellant should not to be left to guess at  what
    the reasons might have been for failure of the case  under  the  Rules.
    The resolution under Article 8 did not remove that  difficulty.   There
    might not have been a need  for  any  lengthy  separate  discussion  of
    reasonableness and paragraph EX.1, but some reason had to be given.

15. I intimated that I found no error of law and that the determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal would stand.  The judge did not deal separately
    with the outcome under paragraph EX.1, but I had little doubt that this
    was because the case was not put to him on the  basis  that  the  third
    appellant's case hinged on the  criterion  of  reasonableness  in  that
    paragraph, nor had the argument  been  put  that  her  case  should  be
    considered firstly and all the other cases then hung on that.  The case
    had  plainly  been  put  as  one  of  the  overall  reasonableness  and
    proportionality of removal of the family  as  a  unit.   That  was  the
    correct approach.  The question of reasonableness was  a  judgment  for
    the judge to make, having assessed all the  evidence  before  him,  and
    treating the interests of the children as a primary but not  overriding
    consideration.  It appeared to me that was exactly what he did and that
    any error was one of form only and not of  substance.   The  submission
    for the appellants (at times) was that  seven  years'  residence  by  a
    child  entitles  her  and  her  entire  family  to  remain  in  the  UK
    indefinitely, without any consideration of reasonableness.  There is no
    such rule, nor will it be introduced by section 117B.

16. Since indicating the outcome, as above, at the hearing,  I  have  given
    some further consideration to what the difference might  be  between  a
    reasonableness and a proportionality test.   Although  the  appellant's
    case turned in large part upon there being some meaningful distinction,
    I was not pointed to any authority.

17. The discussion in Macdonald's Immigration Law & Practice, 8th ed, vol 1
    at �8.20 appears to be in point:

         The proportionality test is clearly more  rigorous,  objective  and
         intrusive (in demanding a greater degree of justification) than the
         Wednesbury test whose borders, even in a human rights case, are set
         by mere rationality.   The  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  has
         repeatedly made clear that in determining whether a breach  of  the
         ECHR can be justified under Articles 8(2)  or  10(2),  the  court's
         supervision goes beyond ascertaining whether  discretion  has  been
         exercised reasonably, carefully or in good faith, and  requires  it
         to determine whether it was  "proportionate  to  a  legitimate  aim
         pursued"  and  whether  the  reasons  adduced   by   the   national
         authorities to justify it are "relevant and sufficient".

18. Article 8 outside the Rules cannot  of  course  come  into  play  until
    Article 8 so far as subsumed within the Rules has been  exhausted.   In
    terms of distinction between the two tests, the judge's progression  to
    the second question was not adverse to the appellants.

19. Any error by the judge is on a minor matter of form on a point not  put
    to him as being particularly material to the outcome.  It is now  given
    an emphasis previously lacking, but  for  all  practical  purposes  the
    reasonableness criterion within paragraph EX.1  is  subsumed  into  the
    overall proportionality assessment.   Indeed,  on  a  strictly  correct
    approach it might well have been said  that  having  decided  the  case
    within the Rules, the judge would be left with no good reason  to  look
    outside them.

20. The only sensible reading  of  the  determination  is  that  the  judge
    considered it reasonable, in all the circumstances, to expect the third
    appellant to leave with the rest of her family.   That  assessment  was
    open to him, and no error of legal  approach  of  any  significance  is
    shown, so it decides the case.  The  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal shall stand.

21. No order for anonymity has been requested or made.
