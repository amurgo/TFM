Representation:

For the Appellant:     Dr E Mynott, legal representative
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State becomes the appellant.
     However, for the sake of consistency and to avoid  confusion  I  shall
    continue to refer to the parties as they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 2. On 9th April 2014 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  N  J  Bennett  gave
    permission to the respondent to appeal  against  the  determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Landes in which she allowed the appeal
    on human rights grounds against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to
    refuse entry clearance as a partner in accordance with  the  provisions
    of Appendix FM and FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.

 3. In granting permission Judge Bennett noted that the grounds took  issue
    with the judge's  conclusions  about  Article  8.   In  particular  the
    conclusion that, although the appellant  did  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM of the Rules and that section EX1  of  that
    Appendix did not apply, the judge had found that  it  was  unreasonable
    and  therefore  disproportionate  to  expect  the  sponsor,  a  British
    citizen, to live with the appellant in his country of citizenship,  the
    United States of America.  Judge Bennett thought it arguable  that  the
    judge  had  erred  in  finding  in  the  appellant's  favour  in  these
    circumstances.

 4. At the hearing in the Upper Tribunal  I  heard  submissions  from  both
    representatives after which I considered the matter for a  few  moments
    and then concluded that the determination did not show an  error  on  a
    point of law and should stand.  An outline of the submissions made  and
    my reasons for that conclusion follow.

 5. Initial submissions  were  made  by  Dr  Mynott  to  suggest  that  the
    respondent's application was out of time as the determination had  been
    sent out on 15th January 2014 but the application  for  leave  had  not
    been received by the Tribunal until 6th  February  2014.   However,  on
    looking at the Tribunal file and electronic records, it was  discovered
    that the determination sent out on 15th January 2014  was  not  a  full
    copy and so the Tribunal promulgated the determination  again  on  30th
    January 2014.  The respondent's application was therefore  received  in
    time.

 6. Mr Mynott argued that the determination did not  show  an  error  on  a
    point of law.  It was fully reasoned and followed the guidance  of  the
    Upper Tribunal set out  in  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  00640  reaching  the
    conclusion that there were compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised under the  Immigration  Rules  to  enable  consideration  of
    Article 8 issues outside them.  He further argued that the  proposition
    set out in paragraph (c) of the respondent's grounds in relation to the
    need for exceptional circumstances was wrong in view of the "compelling
    circumstances" test set out in Gulshan.  He also  emphasised  that  the
    appellant's case was not a "precarious" one as there was no immigration
    offending at the time  of  the  application.   He  suggested  that  the
    grounds amounted to no more  than  a  disagreement  with  the  reasoned
    conclusions of  the  judge.   Further,  although  the  judge  had  made
    reference to the decision of the High Court  in  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900
    (Admin) that was not the subject of the grounds nor,  at  the  time  of
    hearing, had MM been overturned.

 7. Mr Harrison indicated that he relied  upon  the  grounds  and  made  no
    further submissions.

 8. The grounds of application argue that no exceptional circumstances  had
    been justified in the case to put it outside  the  ambit  of  continued
    maintenance of a firm and coherent system of immigration to  require  a
    fresh application as the appellant had failed to satisfy the Rules.

Conclusions

 9. The determination is comprehensive and fair.  The Rules under  Appendix
    FM and the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  are  carefully  considered
    before the judge  reaches  the  conclusions,  open  to  her,  that  the
    appellant was in a relationship which  qualifies  as  a  partner  under
    Appendix FM and the specific relationship between appellant and sponsor
    also meets the requirements of that Appendix.  In the determination the
    judge concedes that, at the date of application, the parties could only
    show an income which was about �250 less than  the  annual  requirement
    for  �18,600  and  that  the  appellant  could  not  benefit  from  the
    provisions in section EX of Appendix FM, but she  carefully  considered
    whether there were arguably good grounds for granting leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules.

10. In conducting the Gulshan exercise the judge  concluded  that,  at  the
    time of the refusal and subsequently, the parties were earning well  in
    excess of the �18,600 p.a. requirement under the Rules.   Additionally,
    in identifying compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
    under the Rules, the judge found other material factors.   She  pointed
    out that, if the appellant had to return to the USA to apply for  entry
    clearance, he would have to give up his employment with the  consequent
    loss of income. Further, if the sponsor had to go to the USA with  him,
    she would also be required to give up her employment and so there would
    be less prospect of the parties showing the income requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Further, if the sponsor did  not  return  with  the
    appellant to America there would then be difficulties in  showing  that
    the couple had lived together for the requisite period of  time  before
    the date of application which, in any event, would have to be based  on
    her income alone which would then be insufficient.   Additionally,  the
    judge identified the fact that the partnership had been formed  at  the
    time when the parties were in a position to support themselves when the
    appellant had appropriate leave.  The judge was  entitled  to  conclude
    that, in all these circumstances (which presented the appellant with  a
    "stark choice") it was evident that the Rules did not recognise all the
    factors relevant to the continuation of Article  8  family  life.   The
    judge was not, therefore, in error in proceeding to consider Article  8
    issues outside the rules

11. In considering the proportionality of  the  respondent's  decision  the
    judge acknowledged the public interest in immigration control and  that
    Parliament  had  expressed  its  satisfaction  with  the  Rules  as  MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 had made clear.

12. Additionally she  considered  proportionality  against  the  compelling
    circumstances which she had already identified. In doing so  the  judge
    made reference, as an example only, to the discussion about how  income
    must be evidenced set out in paragraph 142 of MM  although,  since  the
    date of the hearing before me in the Upper Tribunal, the findings in MM
    have been overturned by the Court of Appeal (MM [2014] EWCA  Civ  985).
    However, reference to the earlier decision does not, in my view, affect
    the outcome in this appeal.  The  issue  before  the  Court  of  Appeal
    (paragraph 1 of MM) was whether  or  not,  amongst  other  things,  the
    minimum  income  requirement  of  �18,600  was  unlawful  as  being   a
    disproportionate interference with a UK  partner's  Article  8  rights.
    That is not the case here because the judge made the clear finding that
    the appellant could not comply with  the  Rules  and  found  compelling
    circumstances, consequent upon the refusal which  were  unique  to  the
    facts of the case relating not just to income,  which  enabled  her  to
    conclude that the respondent's decision was disproportionate.  Further,
    and most importantly, the grounds of application took  issue  with  the
    identification   of   "exceptional   circumstances"   or    "compelling
    circumstances" as opposed to any issue arising under  MM.   With  those
    distinguishing features in mind, my  conclusion  is  that  the  grounds
    amount to no more than a disagreement with the conclusions of the judge
    rather than pointing to an error on a point of law.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain an error on a  point
of law and shall stand.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order nor  do  I  consider
one to be appropriate.
