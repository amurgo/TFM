             NATIONALITY, IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM ACTS 1971-2004



Before:
                       John Freeman (a senior immigration judge)
                       Mrs W Jordan and
                       Dr JO de Barros

Between:
                     [                                 ]
                                  appellant

and:
                  Secretary of State for the Home Department,
                                 respondent

Mr J Adler (counsel instructed by Gupta & Ptnrs) for the appellant
Mr S Ouseley for the respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This decision is reported for

   a) what we say (at �� 7-8) about  the  reasonable  limit  for  delay  in
      reaching a decision;
   b) the principles set out at � 17; and
   c) our conclusions on the requirements for a "family life" point  at  ��
      20-21 (so far as they involve general principles).

   This is a case where the  Tribunal  has  ordered  reconsideration  of  a
   decision of an immigration judge (Mrs C Bart-Stewart), sitting at Hatton
   Cross on 8 April 2005, allowing on article 8 human rights  grounds  only
   an appeal by an Albanian citizen of Kosovo.  The  Tribunal  thought  the
   judge might have made the following errors of law:

   a) misapplying Shala [2003] EWCA Civ 233;
   b) not explaining how she had distinguished N (Sri Lanka)  [2004]  UKIAT
      00069; and
   c) not giving any reasons  for  finding  any  such  "truly  exceptional"
      circumstances in the appellant's private or family life as would make
      removal disproportionate to the  legitimate  purpose  of  immigration
      control in terms of Huang [2005] EWCA Civ 105.

2. The appellant, in common with many thousands of  his  fellow-countrymen,
   had fled to this country in 1998, arriving and  claiming  asylum  on  10
   August; but it took the Home Office till 2005  even  to  interview  him,
   giving reasons for refusal on 18 January, with notice of refusal on  the
   25th. There is no dispute but that even then this only happened  because
   of an intervention by Michael Portillo MP  on  the  appellant's  behalf.
   After making findings of fact on the  appellant's  family  circumstances
   (to which we shall return) at � 30, the immigration judge began her � 31
   with the Portillo intervention, and went on:

   I find it difficult to see  what  pressing  social  needs  can  then  be
   addressed by requiring this appellant to now leave the  United  Kingdom.
   The Secretary of State cannot have had immigration control to  the  fore
   in ignoring this application for so many years. [The presenting  officer
   before her] conceded that there were family ties between the  appellant,
   his grandmother, his  sister  and  his  nephew.  I  consider  that  this
   appellant's case can be distinguished from N (Sri Lanka). In the case of
   this appellant, there are further elements of dependency involving  more
   than normal emotional ties. The Secretary of State has  failed  to  show
   why he has not applied his own policy in the case of this appellant.  He
   has failed  to  give  any  explanation  for  the  substantial  delay  in
   determining the application. I find that  the  circumstances  are  truly
   exceptional and that no reasonable Secretary of State would  remove  the
   appellant in these circumstances.

3. The only criticism that can possibly be made of the first two  sentences
   is that the immigration judge  appears  to  regard  failure  to  make  a
   decision till badgered to do so as necessarily leading to the conclusion
   that removal would be disproportionate  to  the  legitimate  purpose  of
   immigration control. Perhaps this part of her conclusions was  a  little
   short on inductive reasoning; but the fact remains that we  saw  such  a
   feature (considerably more pronounced than here) as one of those leading
   in all the circumstances to such a conclusion in Akaeke  (where we  were
   upheld by the Court of Appeal: see [2005] EWCA Civ 947).

4. The immigration judge's reasons for distinguishing N [2004] UKIAT  00069
   [we wish she - and others - would follow the normal convention of giving
   at least that much of the citation when a  case  is  mentioned  for  the
   first time, which enables it to be found by anyone interested] appear in
   the next two sentences, which refer back to her � 30. We shall  consider
   in due course how far the reasoning at � 30 supports her decision on the
   point; but Mr Adler realistically conceded that the  appellant's  family
   life alone (without the points on policy and delay) could not amount  to
   such "truly exceptional" circumstances in  the  appellant's  private  or
   family life as would make removal  disproportionate  to  the  legitimate
   purpose of immigration control in terms of Huang [2005] EWCA Civ 105.

5. The last two sentences of the immigration judge's �  31  deal  with  the
   (related) questions of Home Office policy and delay. Taking  the  policy
   (on asylum-seekers from Kosovo) first; Mr Ouseley put a document  before
   us  (under  the  heading  of  'FRY  and   Kosovo:   policy   development
   chronology') to show what it actually was at the time in question.  Till
   15 June 1999, most were given either  asylum  or  exceptional  leave  to
   remain, in some cases indefinite. From then till 13 September, all those
   who had arrived before March were to be  given  12  months'  exceptional
   leave to remain: afterwards each was to be dealt with on his  individual
   merits. This represents a rather more accurate version  of  the  picture
   given the immigration judge by citations from Gashi [1999] INLR 276  and
   Shala [2003] EWCA Civ 233, which should no longer be relied on for  this
   purpose. She made no mistake  of  law  in  doing  so,  however,  as  the
   presenting officer did not give her the material we have  had;  and  she
   gave the essential feature of the policy in the last sentence of  her  �
   24: "The grant of one year exceptional  leave  to  remain  ceased  in  a
   policy announcement on 13 September 1999".

6. On delay, the immigration judge again cannot be faulted for  finding  it
   substantial (nearly 6� years from claim to  decision)  and  unexplained.
   What she failed in our view to do was to consider  the  consequences  of
   the Home Office failing to follow their policy or decide the case  in  a
   reasonable time. We first need to consider, as  she  should  have  done,
   what this appellant's reasonable expectations would have been  in  terms
   of the policy in force at the time. While we understand his annoyance at
   fellow-countrymen who arrived at a similar time having got a  favourable
   answer from the Home Office in 1999, in our view only a  general  policy
   could create any legitimate expectation (as was the position in Bakhtear
   Rashid [2005] EWCA Civ 744).

7. The reasonable time-limit for a decision on  a  asylum  claim  has  been
   taken in a number of cases by  the  Tribunal  as  12  months.  Mr  Adler
   challenged us (politely) to produce any specific authority for that; but
   he was certainly able to point to no  other  period  with  any  judicial
   authority behind it; and again we do not regard the experiences  of  the
   appellant's friends as setting any general standard. Asked to propose an
   alternative period, Mr Adler suggested one of about ten months;  but  he
   quite candidly acknowledged that the only basis for  that  was  that  it
   would have put this appellant, arriving in August 1998, within the  more
   generous policy prevailing till June the  next  year.  Again,  taking  a
   general standard from what would  have  helped  an  individual  claimant
   seems to us to be wrong in principle.

8. It seems to us then that the Home Office ought  to  have  got  round  to
   doing something about the appellant's case at latest by 12 months  after
   his arrival. At that point, in August 1999, their policy would have  led
   to a grant of 12 months' exceptional leave to remain, while  they  dealt
   with the influx of asylum-seekers from Kosovo which had taken  place  up
   to then. The question the immigration judge did not ask herself was what
   would have happened when that exceptional leave to  remain  ran  out  in
   August 2000.  By  then  there  was  no  legitimate  expectation  of  the
   appellant's being dealt with other than on  his  individual  merits:  on
   these, so far as his asylum/articles 2 and 3 claim were  concerned,  the
   immigration judge found against him, without any challenge to  that  (by
   way of an answer under r. 30.1 of the Procedure Rules).

9. It  may  be  that  the  immigration  judge  was  either  misled  by,  or
   misunderstood Mr Adler's submissions: see � 15, where she quotes him  as
   referring (correctly) to the effect of the 12-month exceptional leave to
   remain policy: interestingly Mr Adler had himself begun that point "Even
   if there had been a delay of  one  year  after  he  applied  ...".  Then
   however the judge has  him  go  on:  "Had  he  been  granted  asylum  or
   exceptional leave to remain, this would have precluded the need to apply
   for a variation." As Mr Adler frankly acknowledged before us, that is  a
   mistake: only asylum or indefinite leave to remain would have  had  that
   consequence. Whether it was an error of the immigration judge's own,  or
   one into which she was led by Mr Adler, we need not decide: it certainly
   was a mistake of law, and one which led the  immigration  judge  not  to
   consider what difference the failure to  grant  12  months'  exceptional
   leave to remain in August 1999 would have made in the long run.

10. Authorities  While there have been cases (most notably Bakhtear  Rashid)
   where the mere failure to follow a published policy led to a claim being
   allowed, none of them, as  Mr  Adler  acknowledged,  involved  the  mere
   failure to grant  a  temporary  status,  without  more  being  involved.
   Bakhtear Rashid should have got asylum under the policy in force at  the
   relevant time: because of the Home Office's failure to give it  him,  or
   to explain why not, the Court of Appeal said he should  have  indefinite
   leave to remain, even though he  no  longer  qualified  for  asylum.  It
   cannot in our view be argued that  this  appellant,  simply  because  he
   should have got 12 months' exceptional leave to remain in  1999,  should
   now get any form of indefinite leave to remain.

11. What more is required is set out in MM [2004] UKIAT  00016,  a  decision
   of Storey and Warr VPP. Dealing with delay at � 23, they say  that  "...
   given the high volume of applications for asylum which the  Home  Office
   has had to deal with in the past decade or so,  we  do  not  think  that
   periods of delay even  several  years  could  be  considered  excessive,
   unless  accompanied  by  other  special  circumstances  which   disclose
   particular prejudice to a claimant." After analysing Shala  [2003]  EWCA
   Civ 233, they conclude at � 27 (repeated in their summary at � 38)  that
   there  are  three  conditions  precedent  to  any  finding  of   special
   circumstances:

    a) the fact that the appellant had a legitimate claim to  enter  at  the
       time when, on any  reasonable  basis,  his  claim  should  have  been
       determined;
    b) the fact that, had his asylum application been dealt with  reasonably
       efficiently, he would have been likely  to  have  obtained  at  least
       exceptional leave to remain;
    c)  the  fact  that  his  private  or  family  life  had   only   become
       significantly established as a result of the time spent by him in the
       UK where he formed a relationship. Accordingly possession of ELR,  if
       it had been granted when it should  have  been,  would  thereby  have
       given him the ability to apply from within the UK for a variation  of
       leave on the grounds of his relationship.

12. We should have found some difficulty in finding that this appellant  had
   a legitimate claim to enter  this  country  in  August  1999,  when  the
   conditions which had led him to flee Kosovo the year before had  already
   been brought to an end by the NATO intervention. However we do not think
   we need to do that, because at � 31 of MM 04-16 the Tribunal  give  this
   reason for that appellant meeting the first condition:

   ... it is not in dispute that when the  appellant  left  Kosovo  he  was
   fleeing from persecution ... In the circumstances we consider we  should
   assume that the appellant did have a legitimate claim to enter  when  he
   arrived.

   That is certainly true of this appellant; so he meets condition  a).  He
   meets b) too, in the terms set by MM 04-16; but the reference  there  to
   the likelihood of an appellant having got exceptional leave to remain if
   dealt with at the right time assumes that this would have given him  the
   advantage set out at c).


13. In the context of this case, that  would  require  that  this  appellant
   should have been able to put forward some claim  to  remain  during  the
   period August 1999 - August 2000. As Mr Adler accepted, the Human Rights
   Act 1998  was  not  brought  into  direct  application  for  immigration
   purposes till 2 October 2000; so that meant this  appellant  would  have
   needed to be able to make a claim under the  Immigration  Rules  at  the
   relevant time. We pressed Mr Adler as to what that might have been;  but
   the only suggestion he could make as to any such claim which might  have
   continued to date was based on the  appellant's  relationship  with  his
   British girl-friend: this did not enter  into  the  immigration  judge's
   consideration of the case, as (for whatever reason) the girl-friend  did
   not give evidence  before  her.  However,  there  are  more  fundamental
   objections to taking this as satisfying  condition  c):  first,  at  the
   relevant time the appellant and his girlfriend had not been together for
   the two years required by the Rules; and then, as we pointed out  to  Mr
   Adler, they did not get together till  2002  in  the  first  place:  see
   interview Q61.

14. It follows that this appellant is ineligible for  special  consideration
   on a Shala basis, if MM 04-16 represents the last word on  the  subject.
   There is however now  Akaeke  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  947.  This  much-abused
   decision (written by Carnwath LJ, with whom Rix and Chadwick LJJ agreed)
   involved a failed asylum-seeker allowed by the Home Office  to  stay  in
   this country for many years after she lost her appeal, during which time
   she married a British citizen, and applied for leave to remain  on  that
   basis. This application was not dealt with by the Home Office  for  over
   three years, and only then because her solicitors wrote repeated letters
   pressing them to do so. This was described (by the present writer) as "a
   public disgrace", which the Court of Appeal took (see � 25) as enough to
   satisfy the requirement for exceptionality  later  laid  down  in  Huang
   [2005] EWCA Civ 105. They went on:

   Once it is accepted that unreasonable delay on the part of the Secretary
   of State is capable of being a relevant factor, then the  weight  to  be
   given to it in the particular case was a matter for the Tribunal ...

15. There is a brief reference in Akaeke at � 32 to  the  then  very  recent
   decision in Strba? [2005] EWCA Civ 848 (written by  Laws  LJ,  with  the
   agreement of Longmore and Scott Baker LJJ: we should like to express our
   appreciation of the practice of giving a single judgment in  immigration
   cases). We have had more opportunity to  consider  that.  The  facts  in
   Strba? were that the appellant, a Croatian Serb who had  served  in  the
   Serbian army, finally left Croatia in January 1999. It  was  decided  to
   refuse him asylum in November that year, though he was not given  notice
   of refusal  of  leave  to  enter  till  November  2000:  appeals  to  an
   adjudicator and the Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  were  dismissed.  The
   argument for the appellant on the Shala point was  that  he  would  have
   been granted asylum if his claim had been dealt  with  in  a  reasonable
   time; but the Court of Appeal held at � 26

   The fact (if it be such) that a claim might have more  likely  prospered
   had it been decided two years earlier does not necessarily tend to  show
   that the claimant's removal now would be disproportionate to the aim  of
   immigration control.

   They went on to make the same point about Shala as we have already  seen
   in the Tribunal's condition c) in MM 04-16: after reviewing at � 27  the
   effect of the decision in Janjanin [2004] EWCA Civ 448,  they  concluded
   at � 28:

   Shala, then, establishes no particular, free-standing principle. It  was
   a case on its own facts.

16. What the Court of Appeal in Akaeke said  about  Strba?  (at  �  32)  was
   this: "...  the  factual  context  was  wholly  different,  because  the
   applicant had no separate claim to be allowed to enter under the rules."
   Presumably they were not referring to the situation on arrival, or  even
   at the date of the decision to refuse asylum, because the appellants  in
   both cases were at that stage failed asylum-seekers and  no  more.  They
   must have meant that Mrs Akaeke was married to a British citizen by  the
   date of the hearing before the appellate authorities, whereas in  Strba?
   the Court of Appeal (at �  34)  described  the  facts  of  the  case  as
   "...marked by the circumstance that there is in any event  no  claim  of
   interference with family life, and the claim based on private life is at
   most tenuous". We have to try and distil a set of principles out of  the
   two decisions, together with Bakhtear Rashid (and with MM 04-16, so  far
   as it has survived whatever we find to be their  combined  effect),  and
   then look at the result for the present case.

17. Principles

    a) The first thing to be said is that, following Strba?,  delay  without
       more cannot be determinative on  its  own:  in  other  words,  status
       should not be granted merely to compensate the  appellant  or  punish
       the Home Office. Bakhtear Rashid may look very much like  a  case  of
       this; but the facts were found to go as far as abuse of power by  the
       Home Office. Pill LJ (at � 29) set out the reasons for that, with the
       caveat "I am very far from  saying  that  administrative  errors  may
       often lead to a finding of conspicuous  unfairness  amounting  to  an
       abuse". Even on the facts of that case, where the Home Office  should
       have granted the appellant asylum at the relevant time, the Court  of
       Appeal thought it wrong to give him more  than  indefinite  leave  to
       remain,  since  he  no  longer  qualified  for   asylum   under   the
       international Convention.

    b) Next, delay which deprives the appellant of a legitimate  expectation
       (such as being able to make an in-country application  for  leave  to
       remain) which he had at the time a decision  should  have  been  made
       may,  as  in  Shala,  be  enough  on  its   own   to   make   removal
       disproportionate to the legitimate  purpose  of  immigration  control
       even at a  later  date,  when  the  situation  giving  rise  to  that
       expectation is no longer in being.

    c) Delay itself, if sufficiently gross, may take a case which would  not
       otherwise be "truly exceptional" (either because it fell foul of  the
       "anti-queue jumping rule" in Amjad Mahmood [2002] Imm AR 229, or  for
       any other reason) into that category (following Akaeke); but it  will
       only lead to a conclusion that removal is disproportionate  if  there
       is some free-standing claim to be allowed to stay  on  the  basis  of
       current family or private life, which together with the circumstances
       of delay could lead to a "truly exceptional" finding.

    d) Delay will rarely, if ever, appear  gross  enough  to  bring  a  case
       within the last principle unless, as in Akaeke, there is evidence  to
       show it was not acquiesced in by the appellant.  A  claimant  is  not
       entitled to sit back and enjoy whatever this country  has  to  offer,
       relying on no  more  than  the  administrative  incompetence  of  its
       authorities, amazing as this may  sometimes  be.  Evidence  of   some
       formal pressure on the Home Office (either by way of solicitors'  (or
       other representatives') letters (as in Akaeke), intervention by an MP
       (as here), or personal appearance at the Home Office, resulting in an
       attendance note recorded on the file by an official) is likely to  be
       required to show that an appellant has not acquiesced in delay.

18. Conclusions  In this case, there was a delay of  6� years between  claim
   and decision, which the immigration judge was  fully  entitled  to  find
   exceptional. We bear in mind Mr Ouseley's  point  about  the  number  of
   applications from natives of Kosovo at the time  in  question;  but  the
   Home  Office  had  a  perfectly  reasonable  policy  in  force  to  give
   themselves more time to deal with the influx, by way of the  12  months'
   exceptional leave to remain to be given to  those  who  had  arrived  by
   March 1999, but had not been dealt with before 15  June.  They  did  not
   follow it in the present case, and have never given any  explanation  to
   dispel the inference that the reason was  no  more  than  administrative
   incompetence.

19. While there is no specific acceptance by the immigration  judge  of  the
   appellant's account (see � 8) that he "kept calling  the  Home  Office",
   and claimants would be well advised to do more than that, if  they  wish
   to show  that  they  have  not  acquiesced  in  delay,  the  judge  does
   specifically find (at � 20) that, following the  appellant's  submission
   of his statement of evidence form [SEF] in September 1998  "For  reasons
   the respondent is unable to explain, nothing was then done on  his  file
   until six years later after his  MP  intervened".  While  there  was  no
   repeated formal pressure for a decision till then (as  in  Akaeke),  the
   fact that a claimant should, after so long, have to enlist the  help  of
   his Parliamentary representative  to  get  the  executive  to  make  the
   decision which they claim the public interest demands  is  in  our  view
   quite enough (again as in Akaeke) to entitle the  appellate  authorities
   to take a somewhat  diluted  view  of  what  that  public  interest  now
   requires.

20. That as we have seen can only be done  if  the  appellant's  family  (or
   other private) life which could together with the delay amount to "truly
   exceptional" circumstances. The requirement in N 04-69 that family  ties
   of the second degree (for this purpose, other than those between spouses
   or dependent parents or children) should include "elements of dependency
   involving more than normal emotional ties" we regard  as  the  threshold
   for  their  entering  into  an  article  8  consideration  at  all.  The
   immigration judge found that the appellant's care for  his  grandmother,
   and the paternal r�le he filled for his four-year old nephew did involve
   more than such ties. Mr Ouseley objected that the  appellant's  help  to
   his grandmother (with whom he lived) was no more than ordinary family co-
   operation; while the fact that he did  not  live  with  his  sister  and
   nephew took his r�le there out of article 8 family life.

21. We disagree: while many people who share  accommodation  do  things  for
   each other without that amounting to article 8 family (or even  private)
   life, the immigration judge saw the grandmother in this case  and  found
   her frail. While it may sometimes be possible for a sexual  relationship
   to be discounted for article 8 purposes on the basis that the parties do
   not live together, so that it lacks the permanent quality required, that
   consideration can have little or nothing to do with a relationship  such
   as this appellant's with his nephew. The immigration judge  gave  proper
   thought to the possibility that what the appellant  said  about  it  was
   exaggerated, and after considering what others had added,  decided  that
   it was not. In our view, on both the grandmother  and  the  nephew,  the
   immigration judge  was  entitled  to  take  the  view  that  there  were
   "elements of dependency involving more than normal emotional ties".

22. The final question is whether her conclusion that these, taken  together
   with  the  delay,  were  enough  to  amount   to   "truly   exceptional"
   circumstances is invalidated as a matter of law by her mistaken  failure
   (see � 9) to consider what the effect  of   the  Home  Office  making  a
   decision at the right time under their own policy would  have  been.  If
   the law had remained as it was thought to  be  before  Akaeke,  then  we
   might have had to say that the appellant had lost nothing by the  delay,
   so that it could not  make  a  family  life  "truly  exceptional"  which
   otherwise was not so. Even Bakhtear Rashid would not  have  helped  this
   appellant, since the status he would have got if  the  policy  had  been
   applied when it should have been  was  not  a  permanent  one.  However,
   though Akaeke was not available to the immigration judge when  she  made
   her decision, we think it would have fully  justified  her,  taking  the
   gross delay together with her  findings  about  the  appellant's  family
   life, in regarding this as a  "truly  exceptional"  case  where  removal
   would now be disproportionate, regardless of the limited effect  of  the
