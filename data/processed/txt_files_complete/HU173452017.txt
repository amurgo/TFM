                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. On 3 October 2018 First-Tier Tribunal Judge Easterman dismissed the
         appellant's appeal concluding there was no valid appeal. Permission
         to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal on 7  March  2019.  The
         view of the Secretary of State was sought, within a specified  time
         period, as to whether  the  respondent  intended  to  withdraw  the
         decision of 5 October  2017  and  issue  a  fresh  decision  either
         refusing the human rights claim but giving a  right  of  appeal  or
         concluding that the further submissions did not amount to  a  fresh
         claim but providing a proper detailed explanation.

      2. The respondents reply, dated 22 May 2019,  contains  the  following
         relevant paragraphs:

             2.   In summary,  the  respondent's  position  is  that  Judge
             Easterman was wrong to hold that there had been no  appealable
             decision in this case. Whilst the decision  letter  (which  is
             attached to the email accompanying this letter) certainly  was
             somewhat reticent in identifying the  matter  which  had  been
             accepted as such a claim, it stated in unambiguous terms  that
             it constituted a refusal of a human rights claim and was  thus
             an appealable decision  under  section  82(1)(b).  It  is  not
             unknown for a would-be  appellant  to  assert  that  a  letter
             impliedly constitutes an appealable decision  despite  stating
             otherwise (see for example the  reported  decision  in  Sheidu
             (further submissions; appealable decision: Sudan) [2016]  UKUT
             412 (IAC)  but  here  the  reverse  applies.  The  appellant's
             further submissions were put through the paragraph 353 process
             recently approved by the Supreme Court in Robinson and a fresh
             claim was accepted, although not well identified in the letter
             refusing it.


             3.   In those particular circumstances the principle  that  an
             appeal right derives from statute and cannot be  conferred  by
             the executive is not applicable - here  we  properly  notified
             that there was a right of appeal but  did  not  satisfactorily
             explain why.


             4.   In the circumstances the Respondent is minded to  concede
             that Judge Easterman erred in law and to ask that  the  matter
             be remitted on the basis that there is a live appeal  arguable
             on Article8 matters subject to ss82(1)(b) and 84 - 86  of  the
             2002 Act as amended.


      3. In light of this response it serves little purpose for there to  be
         an oral hearing to establish whether Judge Easterman erred in  law.
         The Upper Tribunal exercising its powers to dispose of  the  matter
         on the papers finds that the First-Tier Tribunal has erred  in  law
         in concluding there was no valid appeal when the  opposite  is  the
         case. The decision of that Tribunal is set aside.   The  appeal  is
         remitted for a further hearing before the  First-Tier  Tribunal  at
         Hatton Cross by a judge nominated by the  Resident  Judge  of  that
         hearing centre other than Judge Easterman.

Decision

      4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set aside
         the decision of the original Judge. The appeal shall be remitted to
         the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Hatton Cross to be determined by
         another judge of that Tribunal.

    Anonymity.

      5. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
         45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
         2005.

         I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
