For the Respondent:    The Sponsor, Mrs U Okaeben


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer  ("ECO"),  we
    will, for convenience, refer to the parties as they appeared before the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 15 July 1975.  On
    22 February 2008, he entered the United  Kingdom  as  a  student.   His
    initial leave was subsequently extended  on  the  same  basis  until  5
    January 2013.

 3. On 7 December 2012, he applied for a residence card as the spouse of  a
    French national.  That application was  refused  by  the  Secretary  of
    State and the appellant appealed but that appeal was withdrawn  in  May
    2014.  The appellant then made a fresh application as the spouse of  an
    EEA national.  Neither he nor his spouse  attended,  when  invited,  an
    interview  at  the  Home  Office  and  the  appellant   withdrew   this
    application in February 2015 and voluntarily departed from the UK on 12
    May 2015.

 4. Whilst in the UK, the appellant met the sponsor.  Although the  details
    are not clear to us, it appears that they started seeing each other  in
    August 2014.  In December 2014, the appellant proposed to the  sponsor.
    They married in Nigeria, first in a traditional ceremony on 4 June 2015
    and secondly in a church ceremony on 6 June 2015.  It appears that  the
    appellant divorced his French wife in April 2015.

 5. The sponsor is a British citizen who was born in the UK in  1981.   She
    went, with her parents, to Nigeria in 1982 and returned in  2002  as  a
    student.  She undertook a Master of Pharmacy degree at  the  University
    of  Greenwich  and,  as  we  understand  it,  is  now  a  self-employed
    pharmacist.

The Decision

 6. In August 2015, the appellant applied for entry clearance as the spouse
    of the sponsor under the 'partner' provisions in  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).   On  7  August  2015,  the  ECO
    refused the appellant's application.  First, the ECO was not  satisfied
    that the relationship between the sponsor and  appellant  was  "genuine
    and subsisting" or that they intended to live together  permanently  in
    the UK.  Secondly, the ECO was not satisfied that the appellant met the
    financial requirements in E-ECP.3.1. by having  established  her  self-
    employment income in the UK on the basis of  "specified  documents"  as
    required by Appendix FM-SE.

 7. On 4 December 2015,  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  upheld  the  ECO's
    decision under the Rules and also on the  basis  that  the  refusal  of
    entry clearance did not amount to a breach of Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   His  appeal  was
    limited to the ground that the refusal of entry clearance breached  his
    human rights, namely Art 8 of the ECHR.

 9. Judge R G Walters allowed the appellant's appeal under Art  8.   First,
    he accepted that the relationship between the appellant and sponsor was
    a "genuine and subsisting" one.  Secondly, Judge Walters accepted  that
    the appellant had failed to provide some of the  "specified  documents"
    required to establish the sponsor's income.  In  particular,  and  this
    was accepted by the appellant's representative  before  Judge  Walters,
    there had not been produced the  required  annual  self-assessment  tax
    return to HMRC nor the personal bank statements of the sponsor for  the
    twelve-month period covered by the required tax return.

10. Nevertheless, Judge Walters went on to find, at para 37, as follows:

         "37. I therefore considered whether the ECO had discretion to allow
             the  appeal  under  this  head  even  though   personal   bank
             statements for the same  12  month  period  as  shown  in  the
             template the tax returns had not been provided.  I  find  that
             he did have such a discretion.  He should  have  exercised  in
             the Appellant's favour as there was substantial evidence  from
             HMRC to the effect that the Sponsor was  self-employed  during
             the relevant financial year and during that  year  had  earned
             ï¿½19,049".

11. Then at para 38-42, Judge Walters went on to find  that  the  appellant
    had established a breach of Art 8 as:

         "I do not find that the interference was  in  accordance  with  the
         immigration law".

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

12. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that Judge Walters was not entitled to find  that
    the ECO could have granted entry clearance under the Rules despite  the
    absence of the "specified documents".

13. On 8 November 2017, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Page)  granted  the
    ECO permission to appeal.

14. Before us, the ECO was represented by Mr Richards.  The  appellant  was
    represented by his wife, Mrs Okaeben (the sponsor).

Discussion

15. Mr Richards submitted that the judge had been wrong to allow the appeal
    under Art 8 on the basis of his finding in para 37 that the ECO  had  a
    discretion to "allow"  the  appellant's  application  even  though  the
    specified documents were missing.

16. Mr Richards pointed out that only one bank statement had been submitted
    before the judge, and none were submitted before the ECO.  He  accepted
    that the sponsor had now produced the complete  bank  statements.   The
    sponsor confirmed that she now had the bank statements.  She was unable
    to explain why those statements were not submitted to the ECO.

17. In fact, neither the annual  self-assessment  tax  return  required  by
    Appendix FM-SE nor the full bank  statements  were  made  available  to
    Judge Walters at the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  He records in  paras
    30 and 33 respectively that the appellant's (then) legal representative
    confirmed that none of these documents were in the  appellant's  bundle
    at the hearing.

18. It is clear that entry clearance as a spouse may only be granted  under
    the 'partner' provisions in Appendix  FM  (see  E-ECP.3.1-3.2)  if  the
    applicant establishes that (for these purposes)  the  sponsor  has  the
    requisite self-employed income on the basis of "specified evidence"  as
    set out in Appendix FM-SE.   It is not disputed before us, nor could it
    be, that under Appendix  FM-SE  the  appellant  had  to  establish  the
    sponsor's self-employed income by producing,  inter  alia,  her  annual
    self-assessment tax return to HMRC (see para 7(b)(i)) and personal bank
    statements covering the same twelve-month period as  that  return  (see
    para 7(f)).  These documents were neither supplied with the application
    to the ECO nor were they produced to Judge Walters.

19. With respect to the judge, we are unable to  see  how  the  ECO  could,
    using the judge's words, "allow the appeal" (presumably he meant "grant
    the application") despite their  absence.   The  only  provision  which
    appears to permit an ECO to allow an application despite 'failings'  in
    the documentation is in para D(d)  of  Appendix  FM-SE  but  that  only
    applies where the applicant has  submitted  a  document  in  the  wrong
    format, or a copy and not an original document, or a document does  not
    contain all the specified information.  In those circumstances, if  the
    missing information is verifiable from other documents  or  by  website
    enquiry, then "exceptionally",  providing  the  ECO  is  satisfied  the
    documents provided are genuine, the application may be granted.

20. That cannot apply here.  The appellant did not submit a document in the
    wrong format, neither did he submit a copy rather than an original, and
    the failing was not that a document  failed  to  contain  "all  of  the
    specified information".  The failing in this appeal was the absence  of
    documentation, namely the annual self-assessment  tax  return  and  the
    missing personal bank account statements.

21. Consequently, we see no legal basis for the judge's conclusion in  para
    37 that the ECO had a  discretion  to  grant  the  application  in  the
    absence of the specified documents.

22. The sponsor, in a short skeleton argument,  sought  to  rely  upon  the
    "evidential flexibility" provisions that are contained in para D(b)  of
    Appendix FM-SE.  That provision appears to go further than  para  245AA
    (applicable in  Points-Based  applications)  in  contemplating  an  ECO
    requesting further documentation from an applicant.  The  provision  is
    not limited to where a document is missing from a sequence, is  in  the
    wrong format, is a copy rather than an original, or is a document which
    does not contain all of the specified information.  That is  the  limit
    of evidential flexibility in para 245AA in a  Points-Based  application
    under Part 6A of the Rules.  In addition, para D(b)(ii) also includes a
    case where the applicant "[h]as not submitted  a  specified  document".
    That would appear to be an extension of  the  "evidential  flexibility"
    provision which, in para 245AA(c), specifically excludes the  situation
    where there is  a  "missing"  document  unless  it  falls  within  para
    245AA(b)(i), namely it is a  document  missing  from  a  "sequence"  of
    documents submitted.

23. In this case, the appellant's legal representative does not  appear  to
    have argued before Judge Walters that para D(b)(ii) applied  such  that
    the ECO should have exercised his discretion to seek further  specified
    documentation from the appellant.  That formed no part of the  argument
    set out in the appellant's "grounds of appeal" or "amended  grounds  of
    appeal" prepared by his legal representative.

24. In any event, it does not seem to us that, if it had been relied  upon,
    it was  an  argument  that  should  succeed.   Before  the  judge,  the
    "missing" documentation was still not produced.   It  is  difficult  to
    contemplate that the  ECO  could  be  found  to  have  irrationally  or
    otherwise unlawfully failed to seek documentation  from  the  appellant
    when there was nothing to support its existence either then or, indeed,
    by the time of the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

25. In any event, that is not the basis upon which  Judge  Walters  reached
    his conclusion in para 37.  He did not find that the ECO had,  on  some
    basis, failed to comply with the "evidential  flexibility"  requirement
    in para D(b)(ii).  Instead, he found in the appellant's favour  on  the
    basis that the ECO should have "allow[ed] the appeal" even without  the
    specified documents.  For the reasons we have already given,  that  was
    an error of law and the judge's conclusion in para 37 cannot stand.

26. The appeal was  of  course,  limited  to  Art  8  and,  therefore,  his
    conclusion in para 37 could not found his conclusion in para 42 that  a
    breach of Art 8 was established because the ECO's decision was not  "in
    accordance with the immigration law".

27. We have considerable difficulty, in any event, in accepting that simply
    because a decision (if  this  be  the  established  case)  was  not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules, that necessarily  means  that  a
    breach of Art 8 has been established because under Art 8.2 it cannot be
    shown that the decision was "in accordance  with  the  law",  including
    here the Immigration Rules.  That, in our judgment, runs counter to the
    more limited scope given to the phrase "in  accordance  with  the  law"
    and, in other Articles  in  the  Convention  to  prescribed  "by  law",
    recognised by the Strasbourg Court.  Those words look rather to whether
    the  "law"  is  not  arbitrary,  accessible  and  foreseeable  in   its
    application (see Sunday Times v United  Kingdom  (1970)  2  EHRR  245).
    That approach has been applied domestically  in  the  UK  (see  e.g.  R
    (Gillan)  v  Metropolitan  Police  Commissioner  [2006]  UKHL  12,   in
    particular at [34]).  In our judgment, even if the ECO's  decision  was
    not in accordance with the Immigration Rules, it did  not  obviate  the
    need  to  determine  whether  the  decision  was   a   disproportionate
    interference with the appellant's family life.

28. In that context, it is clear to us that the appellant  could  not,  and
    cannot, succeed under Art 8 in establishing that any interference  with
    his family life with the sponsor is disproportionate.  There is nothing
    inherently unlawful in requiring the appellant  to  establish  that  he
    meets the financial requirements in the Rules,  on  the  basis  of  his
    sponsor's self-employed income, by  requiring  the  production  of  the
    specified documents.  They were not, and at least in the  case  of  the
    annual self-assessment tax return to the  HMRC,  have  still  not  been
    produced.  In  our  judgment,  there  is  nothing  disproportionate  in
    requiring the appellant to make a fresh  application,  relying  on  the
    specified  documents  required  under  Appendix  FM-SE.   There  would,
    inevitably,  be  a  continuing  separation  between  the  sponsor   and
    appellant but that has effectively been ongoing since their marriage in
    2015.  Whilst we recognise the potential distress to both the appellant
    and sponsor, and indeed the sponsor was distressed before us,  that  in
    itself is not in our view sufficient  to  establish  a  breach  of  the
    appellant's human rights to respect for his family life in the  absence
    of proof, as required under the Rules,  that  he  meets  the  financial
    requirements.

Decision

29. For all these reasons, therefore, we conclude that the judge materially
    erred in law in allowing the appellant's appeal  under  Art  8  of  the
    ECHR.

30. We re-make the decision dismissing the appellant's appeal under Art  8.



31. As we indicated to the sponsor at the hearing, the proper course is for
    the appellant to make  a  fresh  application  submitting  the  required
    documentation.  We see no reason why, and Mr Richards acknowledged this
    before us, the ECO should  go  behind  Judge  Walters'  clear  finding,
    having  considered  all  the  evidence  including  the  sponsor's  oral
    evidence, that the relationship between the appellant and sponsor is  a
    "genuine and subsisting" one.
