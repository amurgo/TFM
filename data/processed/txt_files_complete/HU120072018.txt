For the Respondent:    none


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria. The Appellant appealed  against
    the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  who,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on the 7th March 2019, dismissed  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Respondent made on the 25th March 2018  to  refuse  her
    application for leave to remain.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes on
    the 15th April 2019.

 3. An 'error of law' hearing was listed on  the  20th  May  2019  and  the
    Tribunal heard submissions from each of the advocates.  I  reserved  my
    decision and, in a decision, promulgated on the 21st May  2019,  I  set
    out why I had reached the conclusion  that  the  decision  of  the  FtT
    involved the making of an error on a point of law. The issue before the
    Tribunal related to the operation of S117B(6) and the best interests of
    the children concerned. In  the  decision,  I  preserved  a  number  of
    findings of fact which were  not  affected  by  the  error  of  law  at
    paragraph 47 and the matter was set down for a hearing before the Upper
    Tribunal to remake the decision.

 4. In an email sent on 24th June 2019 the Respondent sought permission  to
    withdraw his case under  Rule  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 on the basis that there had  been  fresh  material
    since the FtT hearing and  in  the  circumstances  the  Respondent  was
    content to withdraw their case and to not oppose the appeal.

 5. I have considered the basis upon which the Respondent seeks to withdraw
    his case. Having regard to SM (withdrawal of appealed decision: effect)
    Pakistan [2014] UKUT 00064 (IAC) and TPN  (FtT  appeals  -  withdrawal)
    Vietnam [2017] UKUT 00295 (IAC), I consider  it  appropriate,  for  the
    reasons given, to consent to the withdrawal of the Respondent's case.
 6. Consequently, I proceed on the basis of the  written  request  made  on
    behalf of the Respondent. As there is no challenge to the case advanced
    by the Appellant by the Respondent having already  found  an  error  of
    law, I remake the appeal allowing the Appellant's appeal.


Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made a material  error  of  law.  I  set  aside  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remake it allowing the appeal.


Signed                                  Date 24 June 2019
