Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Claire of Counsel instructed by Linda Myers
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Povey made
    following a hearing at Newport on 7th August 2018.



Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines born on  22nd  May  1956.
    She arrived in the UK in 1999 with a settlement  spouse  visa  but  the
    marriage broke down and when the visa expired she became an overstayer.



 3. After the breakdown of her marriage she applied for leave to remain  on
    compassionate grounds but the application was refused.  It was her case
    that she never received notification of the refusal, in 2001, and  that
    she had tried to contact the  Secretary  of  State  but  had  not  been
    successful.

 4. She made her present application for leave to remain  in  October  2016
    which was refused on 6th April 2017 and it was this refusal  which  was
    the subject of the decision before the Immigration Judge.

 5. The judge  recorded  that  the  appellant  has  four  siblings  in  the
    Philippines who would be able to accommodate her for a short while when
    she returned.  She is educated to degree level and was  employed  as  a
    teacher in the Philippines and since coming to the UK  has  worked  and
    continues to work as a health support worker.

 6. The appellant has a daughter who is married to a UK  citizen  and  they
    have a child who suffers from severe cerebral palsy.  The appellant has
    a close relationship with her daughter and with her  granddaughter,  to
    whom  she  offers  a  great  deal  of  support,  both  practically  and
    emotionally, visiting three days a week, twice after work and  once  on
    her day off.  She spends hours playing with her granddaughter and helps
    her with her physiotherapy  and  co-ordination.   She  maintains  daily
    contact with her via Facetime.

 7. The judge said that there was no medical evidence before him  that  the
    child could not fly and she would be able to visit her  grandmother  in
    the Philippines.

 8. He was satisfied that there was family life between the  appellant  and
    her daughter and her granddaughter because of the support  provided  by
    her to the family which constituted a dependency  over  and  above  the
    normal emotional ties of love and affection.  He did  not  accept  that
    the  appellant  had  established  a  parental  relationship  with   her
    granddaughter since she had not stepped into the shoes of  one  of  her
    parents, rather, she was an important addition to the range of care and
    support afforded to her.  The judge said that the impact upon the child
    required particular consideration as her best interests were at  large,
    but whilst the appellant assisted with her care  there  was  little  to
    suggest that her absence would clinically  undermine  or  diminish  the
    care provided or  her  physical  development  as  a  result.   M  would
    naturally miss her grandmother and might struggle to  understand  where
    and why she had gone, but that reaction would be the same in any  young
    child.

 9. He wrote:-

         "To the extent that any grandchild would benefit from having  their
         grandmother living close by it was in M's best  interests  for  the
         appellant to remain in the UK.  But I did not conclude that it  was
         overwhelmingly so".

10. The judge concluded that having regard to all the relevant factors  the
    need to maintain immigration control outweighed the interference caused
    to the appellant's family life in the UK and on that basis he dismissed
    the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

11. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had in effect applied the wrong  test  when  conducting  the  balancing
    exercise in relation to the competing interests at large in this  case.
    There was no requirement for M's best interests to be  overwhelming  in
    order for the case to succeed under Article 8.

12. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  Simpson  for  the  reasons
    stated in the grounds.  The judge also observed that, with reference to
    the best interests of  the  child  assessment,  the  combined  evidence
    before the  judge  including  medical  reports,  witness  evidence  and
    information in the public domain concerning  disability  were  together
    sufficient information concerning likely heightened emotional impact on
    the granddaughter, should her grandmother have  to  permanently  depart
    the UK of which there was arguable lack of judicial notice.

Consideration as to whether there is a material error of law

13. Mr Tarlow accepted that  the  judge  had  applied  the  wrong  test  in
    relation to the assessment of M's best interests but submitted that the
    error was not material because inevitably the decision would have  been
    the same.

14. I am satisfied that in fact the error was material because on any  view
    this is a finely balanced case.  It cannot properly be  said  that  the
    judge would have inevitably been driven to dismiss this appeal  had  he
    applied the correct approach to the  assessment  of  the  child's  best
    interests.  The judge had already concluded that there was family  life
    between the appellant and her daughter and granddaughter and  therefore
    that there was a particularly strong relationship between them.  It  is
    quite clear  from  the  medical  evidence  that  M's  disabilities  are
    extensive and require a great deal of support and care.

Remaking the Decision

15. Mr  Tarlow  accepted  that  M  benefitted  from  the  presence  of  her
    grandmother but submitted that her best interests  were  outweighed  by
    her poor immigration history and the  public  interest  in  immigration
    control.  He observed that this could be  a  case  where  it  might  be
    sensible to adjourn for better medical evidence but said  that  he  was
    not seeking to challenge either the medical evidence or indeed the oral
    evidence which was given in the hearing and in the witness  statements.



16. I saw no reason to adjourn this case.  There are no credibility  issues
    and the assessment can be made now more expeditiously than putting  the
    parties and indeed the State to the expense of a  remittal  to  another
    judge.

17. Mr Claire submitted that the medical needs of M were extensive  and  he
    provided more up-to-date information about her recent operation.

18. The medical evidence is set out in the original appellant's bundle. The
    first medical report is dated 18th June 2015 when M was 15 months  old.
    It states that she has full range of movement in her  upper  and  lower
    limbs but is not able to reliably sit without support.  She has  severe
    speech production difficulties impacting on  her  communication  skills
    and  a  delay  in  her  play  skills  associated  with   her   physical
    difficulties.

19. There is a further report dated 18th July 2017 when M was 3ï¿½ years old.
     She still needed support for sitting and was not yet able to  pull  to
    stand.  She could get around by rolling but did not really crawl.   She
    could not load food onto a spoon, but if it was loaded she could get it
    into her mouth.  Her language skills were  clearly  much  improved  and
    there was no concern with her spine or with her hearing.  She was still
    in nappies.

20. The final report is dated 22nd May 2018  and  refers  to  an  operation
    which M has had on her hips.   The  medication  which  she  is  on  was
    causing them to become swollen.  She was an inpatient  for  eight  days
    following an operation to try to align her hips more successfully.  She
    still needs a mobility wheelchair at all times.

21. The evidence in the witness statements, both from the appellant and her
    daughter, are unchallenged.  The granddaughter suffers  from  permanent
    bilateral cerebral palsy and the appellant's daughter  is  her  primary
    registered carer.  She would not be able to leave her daughter  in  the
    care of another or bring her  to  the  Philippines  to  visit  her  for
    practical reasons.

22. The appellant plays an active and integral  role  in  the  welfare  and
    upbringing of her  only  grandchild  who  requires  constant  care  and
    attention.  She also provides essential support, guidance  and  respite
    to her daughter and her partner.

23. It is not argued by Mr Claire that  the  appellant  can  bring  herself
    within  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   There  is  no
    challenge  to  the  judge's  conclusions  that  there   would   be   no
    insurmountable obstacles to her  returning  to  the  Philippines,  even
    though she has been in the UK for such a lengthy period.

24.  When  deciding  whether  the  appellant  could  succeed  outside   the
    Immigration Rules I  am  required  to  take  into  account  the  public
    interest consideration set out in paragraph 117B.  The  maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls  is  in  the  public  interest  and  the
    appellant has been in the UK without leave for over fifteen years.

25. She does speak English and she is not a burden on the taxpayer  because
    she has worked here, but these are neutral factors rather than  factors
    going in her favour.

26. She has been here for a very long time but her private life has  always
    been precarious, or indeed unlawful, and therefore little weight should
    be given to it.

27. She does not have a parental relationship with a qualifying child.

28. That said, M's  best  interests  are  manifestly  best  served  by  the
    appellant remaining in the UK.   This  little  girl  has  very  severe,
    physical problems.  It is absolutely clear from  all  of  the  evidence
    that her grandmother  is  an  integral  part  of  her  care,  not  only
    providing love and support to M herself, but also respite care  to  her
    daughter and her husband.

29. M's medical condition is such that  it  would  be  extremely  harsh  to
    require her to be separated from her grandmother when  she  has  always
    been  a  central  part  of  her  daily  routine  that.  The   practical
    difficulties in getting M to the Philippines  are  obvious.   It  would
    also be extremely difficult for the appellant's daughter to visit.   In
    effect  the  grandmother's  removal  would  be  the  severance   of   a
    relationship which is integral to M's life over and above the effect it
    would have on any other child because of her extreme physical needs.

30. The best interests of M are overwhelmingly in favour of  the  appellant
    being allowed to remain  in  the  UK  and,  in  this  particular  case,
    outweigh the interests of the respondent in the appellant's removal.

Notice of Decision

31. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is  set  aside.   It  is
    remade as follows:-

    The appellant's appeal is allowed.
