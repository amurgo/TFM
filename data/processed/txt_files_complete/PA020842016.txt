Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D McGlashan, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals  against  a  decision  by  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Murray, dismissing his appeal against refusal of asylum,
    on these grounds:

      The judge erred in law because the reason why  she  does  not  believe
      that the authorities raided the appellant's house and  found  leaflets
      is irrational (paragraph 51):

      a. This is the principal reason why the judge  does  not  believe  the
      appellant's account: from the  second  to  fourth  sentences  in  that
      paragraph she is saying that because only two people  knew  about  the
      appellant's alleged smuggling activities it is not credible  ...  that
      cannot be right: it is in the nature of such activities that the fewer
      people who know - the better.

      b.  So far as there are others - one  reason  seems  to  be  that  the
      appellant got dates wrong. Reference needs to be made to question  109
      in the AIR in which in answer to the question "When did this  happen?"
      the appellant states "I don't know exact date - but it was  the  ninth
      month 1394. (November/December) 9/10/1394". This suggests a  confusion
      of the Persian and Gregorian calendars.  Having  regard  to  the  fact
      that the  appellant  was  illiterate  (a  fact  not  disputed)  it  is
      unreasonable to use this  as  a  reason  why  his  account  should  be
      disbelieved.

      If there is another reason why he is not believed it may be  that  "no
      reason  has  been  given  of  why  he  would  be  suspected  of  those
      activities" (fourth sentence). But according to the  country  evidence
      ... there was every reason -  being  the  suspicions  of  the  Iranian
      authorities of such activities and the harsh treatment  meted  out  to
      anyone found guilty of engaging in smuggling leaflets. The  judge  has
      ignored this evidence.

 2. Mr McGlashan filed  at  the  hearing  in  the  UT,  without  objection,
    evidence of conversion of dates  from  the  Iranian  to  the  Gregorian
    calendar - 1 Dey 1394 was 2 December  2015  and  1  Azar  1394  was  22
    November 2015.  It was not explained how this evidence showed error  of
    law by the judge, or how it might have advanced the appellant's case in
    the FtT.

 3. Mr McGlashan further submitted as follows.  It was highly  likely  that
    only two people would know the leaflets were  in  the  house.   It  was
    accepted there had been no evidence of  how  the  authorities  came  to
    know, but that was not within the appellant's knowledge and not for him
    to explain.  As a shepherd the appellant would have been in a  position
    to meet the peshmerga.  He gave a detailed account  of  events  at  his
    interview.  The judge failed to assess  the  account  in  its  cultural
    context: the illiteracy  of  the  appellant,  the  non-availability  of
    education in Kurdish, and  the  hostile  attitude  of  the  authorities
    towards the Kurds.  The case should be remitted for  fresh  hearing  in
    the FtT.

 4. Mrs Pettersen submitted thus.  The decision was to be read as a  whole.
    The  conclusions  at  �51  and  52  were  briefly  stated  but  legally
    sufficient, and followed naturally from the terms set out of the cross-
    examination and  the  submissions.   The  appellant  had  no  political
    affiliation and claimed to have run risks for no apparent reason.   His
    account was rejected not simply for a discrepancy  in  dating  but  for
    lack of any convincing detail or substance.  The judge's  finding  that
    the account was unpersuasive was open to her,  and  involved  no  legal
    error.

 5. I reserved my decision.

 6. Point a in the grounds does not accurately reflect what the judge said.
     She did not say it was unlikely that only two people would know.   She
    said that if that were the fact, she did not accept  there  would  have
    been a raid.

 7. The supplementary point that it was not in  the  appellant's  knowledge
    why there was a raid is correct as far as it goes, but  does  not  show
    error.  There is nothing wrong with the judge's  observation  that  the
    evidence disclosed no reason for the authorities to be suspicious.

 8. The judge adds in that sentence that the appellant dated  the  raid  to
    November / December yet entered the UK on 28 October of the same  year.
    There is no factual or legal  error  in  noting  the  discrepancy,  and
    nothing to suggest that it was given any  more  weight  than  it  could
    properly bear.  Illiteracy (which the judge accepted) is not a token by
    which all discrepancies in dating must be overlooked.

 9. The judge was also entitled to note that the appellant  accepted  there
    was a dating discrepancy, which he attributed to poor memory for dates,
    and that there was no evidence to support that assertion.

10. The final paragraph of the grounds is also misconceived.  The judge did
    not think that there was  no  evidence  that  the  Iranian  authorities
    penalise smuggling of  political  anti-regime  leaflets.   That  was  a
    feature of the case in no doubt.  The judge's point was that there  was
    no reason for suspicion falling on the appellant.

11. There are other reasons in the decision.  The judge noted at  �52  that
    the appellant said he helped the party for a year, listened  to  people
    talk about it, put himself in danger for it, and yet knew  very  little
    about it.  That is not criticised.  It was well within reason  to  give
    it some adverse significance.

12. The judge at �53 also rejected the appellant's account of activities in
    the UK, for reasons not criticised.  That was a minor issue, not of the
    essence, but it was another pointer against general credibility.

13.  I  agree  also  with  the  submission  for  the  respondent  that  the
    conclusions reached must be read in context of the whole  decision;  in
    which context, they are hardly surprising.

14. The grounds and submissions for the appellant resolve into no more than
    disagreement on the facts.  They do not show that  the  making  of  the
    decision of the involved the making of any error on  a  point  of  law.
    The decision of the FtT shall stand.

15. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
