Appearances

For the Appellant:           Mr L Parker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr B Ali of Counsel

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Entry Clearance Officer appeals against the determination  of  an
    Adjudicator, Mr D Bartlett, who allowed the respondent's appeal against
    the decision made on 21 November 2002 refusing her entry clearance as a
    spouse.   In  this  determination  the  Tribunal  will  refer  to   the
    respondent to this appeal as the applicant.

Background.

2.    The applicant applied for entry clearance on 23 September 2002.   The
    Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that there would be  adequate
    maintenance and  accommodation  available  to  the  applicant  and  her
    dependants without recourse to public funds.

3.    In brief outline the background to this appeal is as follows.
    The sponsor's brother is married to the applicant's niece.  The sponsor
    went on holiday to Morocco with his brother in July 2001  and  met  the
    applicant.  Subsequently they became engaged.  An application was  made
    for a fianc�e visa in August 2001 but this was  refused.   The  sponsor
    kept in contact with the applicant and in March  2002  he  returned  to
    Morocco.  They married on 10 April 2002.  A child Yasir Omar  was  born
    in January 2003.

4.    The evidence before the Entry Clearance Officer was that
    the sponsor was in receipt of  income  support  and  disability  living
    allowances totalling �135.63 per week.  His rent was paid from  housing
    benefit but he was still liable for  utility  bills,  transport  costs,
    food and clothing expenses.  There was no evidence of  any  prospective
    employment or  that  he  was  actively  seeking  employment.  In  these
    circumstances the Entry Clearance Officer was not  satisfied  that  the
    sponsor would be able to support additional members  of  the  household
    without further recourse to public funds.  He noted that he  had  moved
    from a one to a three bedroomed council house and took the view that by
    definition this amounted to additional recourse to public funds.

5.    There was evidence that relatives of the  applicant  living  in  this
    country were prepared to provide additional financial support. One  had
    signed a deed of covenant to pay the applicant �50 per week  until  she
    had found job and another had signed a similar deed for �40.  The Entry
    Clearance Officer was not satisfied that this offer of  assistance  was
    realistic or sufficient. If they withdrew their financial support,  the
    likelihood was that this would  lead  to  further  recourse  to  public
    funds.  The applicant was divorced with a 17 year old son  to  support.
    She was unemployed and had no qualifications.  She had  said  that  she
    would work as a cleaner but there was no  evidence  of  any  offers  of
    employment.  As she had a young baby to look after the Entry  Clearance
    Officer doubted whether she would find a job within a reasonable  time.
    For these reasons he was not  satisfied  that  the  applicant  and  the
    sponsor could maintain or  accommodate  themselves  adequately  without
    further recourse to public funds.

The Adjudicator's decision.

6.    The Adjudicator heard the appeal against this decision on
    15 August 2003.  It was accepted that the sponsor  was  disabled  as  a
    result of an industrial accident and was in receipt of  state  benefits
    totalling �137 a week.  His benefit also included  housing  benefit  in
    the form of rented  accommodation.   The  applicant  had  worked  as  a
    dressmaker in Morocco but would seek work as a cleaner  in  the  United
    Kingdom if necessary.  Her sister who is married to a  British  citizen
    and had been resident in the United Kingdom since  1993  had  signed  a
    covenant undertaking to pay �40  a  week  to  the  Applicant  from  her
    arrival until she found permanent  employment.   Another  relative  had
    signed a similar covenant but in the  sum  of  �50.   The  sponsor  had
    confirmed that he was still unemployed but he had  obtained  a  driving
    licence and hoped through contact with  a  minicab  company  to  obtain
    employment at a future date.

7.    He would be able to look after their son when the applicant went  out
    to work.  He had not been able to find employment on her behalf as that
    was difficult without her being present.   He  confirmed  that  he  had
    moved into a larger flat in October 2001 by an exchange agreement  with
    a neighbour who wished to move into a smaller flat.  The move  resulted
    in a nominal increase of �10 per fortnight in his rental expenses.  The
    Adjudicator accepted that the sponsor appeared  to  be  a  genuine  and
    credible witness.  Documents provided by the relatives offering to  pay
    �40 and �50 a week  respectively  were  credible  and  plausible.   The
    Adjudicator accepted that those offers were  genuine.   The  employment
    prospects of the applicant were difficult to assess  but  he  commented
    that her English was improving and that should improve  her  employment
    prospects.

8.    Assessing the  matter  overall  the  Adjudicator  said  that  he  was
    satisfied  that  the  applicant  had  established  on  a   balance   of
    probabilities that her husband would  receive  �135.63  as  his  income
    support and disability allowances.  In addition he had housing benefit.
     The Adjudicator was not satisfied that the move from a one bedroom  to
    a three bedroom flat constituted a recourse to additional public funds.
     As the covenants  were  seriously  entered  into  by  the  applicant's
    relatives the result was that the applicant had established that  there
    was a weekly amount of �135.63 plus �90 and accommodation  in  a  three
    bedroomed flat.   The  total  weekly  income  would  be  �225.63.   The
    Adjudicator was satisfied that the applicant and her  family  could  be
    accommodated and maintained without recourse to further  public  funds.
    The appeal was allowed under the Immigration  Rules.   The  Adjudicator
    went on to consider in the alternative the appeal on Article 8 grounds.
     He was not satisfied that there would be an insurmountable obstacle to
    the sponsor moving to Morocco and came  to  the  view  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision was reasonably open to him and  could  not
    be regarded as disproportionate.  The appeal  was  dismissed  on  human
    rights grounds.

Grounds of appeal.

9.    The Entry Clearance Officer has  appealed  against  the  decision  to
    allow the appeal under paragraph 281 of HC 395.  The grounds argue that
    the Adjudicator failed to take into account the fact that the  payments
    of �90 per week would be treated as income and lead to a  reduction  of
    the sponsor's income support.

Preliminary issues.

10.   At the hearing before  the  Tribunal  Mr  Ali  made  two  preliminary
    applications.  The first was an application for permission  to  file  a
    respondent's notice seeking to  challenge  the  Adjudicator's  decision
    dismissing the appeal  on  Article  8  grounds.   The  notice  and  its
    supporting documents are included in the applicant's bundle  which  was
    served on the Tribunal under cover of a letter dated 27 April 2004.  Mr
    Parker did not receive a copy of these documents until the day  of  the
    hearing.  Mr Ali submitted that  the  Article  8  appeal  was  properly
    arguable and that there would be a real risk of injustice if  he  could
    not pursue his cross-appeal.   His  second  point  was  that  the  Vice
    President when granting permission had identified issues of fact rather
    than law and there was only a right of appeal on a point of  law.   The
    gist of Mr Ali's submission was that the Tribunal should set aside  the
    grant of permission and that would bring the appeal to an end.

11.   Mr Parker  submitted  that  it  was  an  abuse  of  process  for  the
    respondent's notice to be produced on the day of  the  hearing.   There
    was no adequate  explanation  why  a  notice  had  not  been  filed  in
    accordance with the time limits in Rule  19  of  the  Procedure  Rules.
    Permission to appeal had been granted.  The Tribunal's  obligation  was
    to proceed to hear the  appeal  on  its  merits  rather  than  consider
    whether permission had been properly granted.

12.   The Tribunal is not prepared to permit the respondent's notice to  be
    filed so late in the day.  Rule 19(2) requires a  notice  to  be  filed
    within such period as the Tribunal may direct  or  where  the  Tribunal
    makes no direction within ten days after the respondent is served  with
    notice that the appellant has been granted permission  to  appeal.   In
    this case notice was given on 19 November  2003  which  also  gave  the
    hearing date on 12 May 2004.  There has been ample opportunity to  file
    a respondent's notice and no adequate explanation for the failure to do
    so in time.  The issues relating to article 8 are clear on the face  of
    the determination.  In any event, the Tribunal is  not  satisfied  that
    there is any reasonable prospect of a successful appeal on the issue of
    proportionality  bearing  in   mind   the   recent   starred   Tribunal
    determination in M (Croatia) [2004] UKIAT 00024*.

13.   The second issue raised by Mr Ali is dealt with by the Tribunal in
    DD (Croatia) [2004] UKIAT 00032*.  There is no power to set  aside  the
    grant of permission to appeal. As the Tribunal commented  in  paragraph
    34 of that determination, it  would  be  quite  inappropriate  for  the
    Tribunal before hearing an appeal to consider whether leave should have
    been granted rather than considering what the  outcome  of  the  appeal
    should be.  The grant of leave imposes on  the  Tribunal  the  duty  to
    determine the appeal and not to question  the  jurisdiction  conferred.
    The Tribunal accordingly refuses Mr Ali's second application.

Submissions.

14.   Turning to the merits of the appeal, Mr  Parker  submitted  that  the
    Adjudicator had erred in law by failing to take into account  the  fact
    that the additional payment of �90 per week would be deducted from  the
    sponsor's entitlement to income support.  He produced an  extract  from
    the Welfare Benefits and Tax Credits Handbook  prepared  by  the  Child
    Poverty Action Group CPAG 2003/2004.  For  each  of  the  means  tested
    benefits other types of income are taken into account less any  tax  on
    them.  According to the sponsor he received income support  of  �109.18
    per fortnight (�54.59 per week).  The money received from his relatives
    in the sum of �90 would be treated as income and this would  disentitle
    him to income support.  It  would  also  mean  that  he  would  not  be
    entitled to housing benefit or to  a  reduction  of  his  council  tax.
    Income support was the key to a wide range of other benefits.

15.   Mr Ali submitted that  there  was  no  basis  for  going  behind  the
    Adjudicator's implicit findings that the sum of �90 would not be  taken
    into account.  This was a goodwill gesture of support  from  relatives.
    It had been covenanted to help the applicant meet her basic needs.   He
    submitted that the Tribunal should take account of Article 8 regardless
    of whether there was a formal appeal because of the basic obligation in
    the Human Rights Act 1998 which would prevent the Tribunal from  acting
    in  a  way  which  was  incompatible  with  a  Convention  right.   The
    insurmountable obstacle test in Mahmood [2001] Imm AR 229 was  set  too
    high and should be read in the context of  judgments  of  the  European
    Court such as  Abdulaziz Cabales and Balkandali v UK [1985] 7 EHRR 471.
     Looking at the facts as a whole the decision to refuse entry clearance
    was a breach of Article 8.

The Tribunal's conclusions.

16.   The point in issue in this appeal  is  whether  the  Adjudicator  was
    correct when he assumed  that  the  family's  weekly  income  would  be
    �225.63 (i.e. benefit of �135.63 plus �90 from members of the  family).
    Mr Parker's submission is that the payments from the applicant's family
    would be treated as income and deducted from his income  support.   The
    Tribunal accept on the basis of the evidence in the CPAG Handbook  that
    these regular payments would be treated as  income  and  be  deductible
    from the sponsor's income support.  Other types  of  income  are  taken
    into account less any tax  due  on  them.   Even  assuming  that  these
    payments could be regarded as charitable or  voluntary  payments,  they
    would only fall to be completely ignored if they were intended and used
    for anything except food,  ordinary  clothing  or  footwear,  household
    fuel, council  tax,  water  charges  and  rent.   It  appears  that  if
    voluntary payments are taken into account there  is  a  �20  disregard.
    Working on the basis that the sponsor receives income support of �54.59
    per week, even with a  �20  disregard,  his  income  support  would  be
    reduced to zero, assuming a pound for pound reduction.  Mr  Ali  argued
    that the result would be that the sponsor would still have  more  money
    because instead of having �135 a week he would have the �90 a week from
    his relatives together with �23.26 industrial injuries benefit and  his
    disability living allowance.  The argument is that the  income  support
    of �54.59 per week is replaced by a payment of �90  and  therefore  the
    sponsor is about �35 a week better off.

17.   Unfortunately the position is not as straightforward as that.  If the
    sponsor does not receive income support, he loses  his  entitlement  to
    other related benefits such as housing benefit.  There is  no  evidence
    before the Tribunal of how much rent or council tax is paid or what the
    effect would be on the family's budget of losing these benefits.  There
    is insufficient information available before the  Tribunal  for  us  to
    make clear findings on the consequences of the additional payments from
    family members being treated as income.  It is a  pity  that  a  proper
    schedule has  not  been  prepared  to  show  the  consequences  on  the
    sponsor's income from benefits so that a proper comparison can be  made
    firstly with his current income and what his financial  position  would
    be assuming the Tribunal is right that the payments by  covenant  would
    be taken into  account.   There  should  also  be  a  schedule  of  his
    expenditure so that an informed decision can be made as to whether  the
    family can maintain themselves adequately.

18.   At the hearing before  the  Tribunal  it  was  not  argued  that  the
    exchange of accommodation by itself amounted to a further  recourse  to
    public funds.  There is no evidence before us of any increase  in  rent
    save for  the  reference  to  a  �10  increase  in  fortnightly  rental
    expenses. The real issue in the light of the way the case has been  put
    to the Tribunal is whether housing benefit will continue to be  payable
    as rent and council tax forms part of the family's general  expenditure
    when considering the adequacy of maintenance.

Decision.

19.   In our view the most appropriate course to  take  is  to  remit  this
    appeal to Mr Bartlett for him to reopen the  hearing  so  that  he  can
    consider further evidence about the effect on the sponsor's benefits of
    a receipt of �90 from  the  applicant's  relatives.   It  may  be  that
    further evidence will show that the Tribunal is wrong  in  its  finding
    that these payments will be  treated  as  income  and  deductible  from
    income support but the onus is on the parties to produce  the  relevant
    evidence  including  properly  prepared   schedules   of   income   and
    expenditure so that the Adjudicator can make an  informed  decision  on
    the issues before him.

20.   For the sake of completeness the Tribunal is not satisfied that it is
    arguable that the Entry Clearance Officer's decision  was  contrary  to
    Article 8. If the provisions  in  the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to
    maintenance and accommodation are not fulfilled, it would  only  be  in
    exceptional cases indeed that a  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance
    would contravene the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8.

21.   For these reasons, this appeal is allowed to the extent  that  it  is
    remitted to Mr Bartlett for him to reopen the  hearing  and  reconsider
    the issues of maintenance and accommodation in the light of any further
    evidence which may be produced.
