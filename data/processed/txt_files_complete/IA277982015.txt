For the Appellant:     Ms Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                    Chambers Sols (Oldham)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of  birth  23rd  November
    1989. On the 24th November  2016  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  AK
    Simpson) allowed his appeal on human rights grounds. The  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department obtained  permission  to  appeal  against
    that decision on the 4th April 2017,  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Dineen.






    Background and Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 2. The Respondent Mr Riaz came to the United Kingdom as a student in 2009.
     He has remained here ever since and in February 2015  he  applied  for
    leave to remain on human rights  grounds  on  the  basis  that  he  was
    married to a British  national,  Mrs  Nabila  Riaz.   The  reasons  for
    refusal letter is dated the 16th July 2015. The claim  failed  for  the
    following reasons:

              i) Mr Riaz did not meet the suitability requirements  set  out
                 in Appendix FM. He had submitted an English  language  test
                 certificate issued by the Educational Testing Service (ETS)
                 which had subsequently been invalidated. ETS had  confirmed
                 to the Secretary of State for the Home Department that they
                 believed that the test scores on this certificate had  been
                 obtained through deception, namely the use of  a  proxy  to
                 take the speaking test;


             ii) Nor had he produced  sufficient  evidence  to  satisfy  the
                 Secretary of  State  that  his  marriage  was  genuine  and
                 subsisting;

            iii) In respect of EX.1 the Secretary of State was not satisfied
                 that there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
                 continuing outside of the UK;

             iv)  It  was  not  considered  that  there   were   exceptional
                 circumstances such that leave should be granted 'outside of
                 the rules'.

 3. Those then were the matters in issue before the First-tier Tribunal.


 4. The matter came before Judge Simpson on  the  4th  April  2016,  and  a
    further hearing took place on the 9th May 2016. The First-tier Tribunal
    heard oral evidence from Mr Riaz and his wife. It  directed  itself  to
    the conclusions of the President of this Chamber, McCloskey J, in SM  &
    Qadir v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  (ETS  -Evidence-
    Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC).


 5. Dealing first with the question of the alleged deception  the  Tribunal
    found itself satisfied that the Secretary of State had  discharged  the
    evidential burden, in that she  had  produced  the  'generic'  evidence
    familiar in  ETS  cases  (the  witness  statements  by  Millington  and
    Collins) and evidence specifically linking the  ETS  findings  with  Mr
    Riaz (an "albeit illegible" printout). However, having  had  regard  to
    all of the evidence the Tribunal was not  satisfied  that  the  overall
    legal burden had been discharged.   Accordingly  the  'ETS'  issue  was
    resolved in favour of Mr Riaz.

 6. The Tribunal found there to be "copious" evidence  that  this  marriage
    was genuine and  subsisting,  and  that  the  relationship  eligibility
    requirements were therefore satisfied.

 7. Moving on to consider proportionality the Tribunal examined  with  care
    the financial material that was placed before it. It concluded that the
    couple had established that the household income  was  well  above  the
    requisite �18,600, but that there was a failure  to  meet  all  of  the
    requirements in  Appendix  FM-SE.  Specifically,  Mrs  Riaz  could  not
    produce a letter from her employer stating her  annual  salary  because
    she was on a zero hours contract.  The Tribunal directed itself to  the
    guidance in R (Sunasee) v Upper Tribunal (IAC)  & Anor [2015] EWHC 1604
    (Admin) to the effect that a 'near miss' could not be determinative  of
    the appeal, but nor could  it  be  excluded  as  irrelevant.   It  then
    concluded [at 18]:

         "Having weighed all relevant factors in the balance, including  (1)
         that the respondent's reasons for refusal have  been  shown  to  be
         unjustified and (2) that the appellant's wife did  earn  more  that
         the  �18,600  income  threshold  but  was  unable  to   provide   a
         satisfactory employer's letter through  no  fault  of  her  own  ie
         simply because she had a zero hours' contract, I take the view that
         the decision to remove the appellant in these  circumstances  would
         be disproportionate".




      The Challenge


 8.  The Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  has  two  complaints
    about the way that the First-tier Tribunal approached the appeal:


              i) In light of the evidence it is clear that the Secretary  of
                 State for the Home Department reasonably concluded that the
                 appellant had used deception in his application;


             ii) The Article 8 balancing exercise is flawed for a failure to
                 weigh in the public interest.




    Error of Law


 9. The matter came before me on the 14th June 2017. The Secretary of State
    for the Home Department was that day represented by  Senior  Presenting
    Officer Mr McVeety. Mr Riaz was  represented  by  Mr  Hussain.   Having
    heard their submissions I made the following findings.


10. I am satisfied that the 'ETS' findings were open to the  Judge  on  the
    evidence that was before her and for the reasons that  she  gives.  The
    grounds of appeal are curiously drafted. This was not a judicial review
    and the First-tier Tribunal was not confined to considering whether the
    decision of the Secretary of State was a "reasonable" one. The Tribunal
    was obliged to conduct a merits review and weigh all of the evidence in
    the balance itself.  The Tribunal accepted that the Secretary of  State
    had discharged the evidential burden of  proof  on  the  basis  of  the
    generic evidence. I must say that I have my doubts about this:  if  the
    spreadsheet was illegible and there was no other  evidence  linking  Mr
    Riaz to the alleged fraud it is difficult to see how that  was  so.  In
    any event, that burden was found to be discharged. It was then  for  Mr
    Riaz to provide his  explanation  of  events.  This  he  did,  and  his
    detailed evidence about where he went to take the test, what was in  it
    and the circumstances is set out at paragraphs  7-9  of  the  decision.
    Judge Simpson then considered all of this evidence in  the  round,  and
    found that on balance the legal burden was not discharged.   I can find
    no legal error in the approach taken, nor the conclusions reached. That
    part of the decision is upheld.


11. The same cannot be said of the Article  8  reasoning.   Decision-makers
    are not obliged to set out s117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 chapter and verse, but some at least some  regard  must
    be had to the public interest in refusing leave to persons who  do  not
    qualify for it under the rules. In  this  case  the  substance  of  the
    proportionality assessment was the observation that the ETS  allegation
    had not been made out, the relationship  was  real  and  that  Mr  Riaz
    failed under the rules for want of specified evidence.   That was not a
    complete assessment, because the Tribunal did not consider  the  public
    interest in removing persons who do not qualify  for  leave  under  the
    Rules: it follows that this part of the decision must be set aside.



    The Re-Made Decision

12. This is a  human  rights  appeal  and  the  ultimate  question  I  must
    therefore decide upon is whether, at  the  date  that  I  re-make  this
    decision,   the  refusal  of  leave  to  Mr  Riaz  would  amount  to  a
    disproportionate interference with his Article 8  rights.  My  starting
    point must be the Immigration Rules.


13. At the date that the Secretary of State considered this application she
    assessed it to fail  under  the  rules  for  the  reasons  set  out  at
    paragraph 2 (i)-(iii) above.  The  first  two  matters  in  issue  were
    resolved in favour of Mr Riaz, and I have upheld  those  findings:  the
    application  should  not  have  been  refused  on  'suitability'  (ETS)
    grounds, and this  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.   The
    remaining issue arising under Appendix FM was whether EX.1 was engaged.
    This 'exception' only becomes relevant where an applicant is 'eligible'
    under the terms of Appendix FM but he for some reason fails to meet the
    requirements for  leave  to  remain  under  the  'five  year  route  to
    settlement'. Most commonly this will be because the applicant does  not
    have valid leave at the time that he made his application,  or  because
    he is unable to demonstrate that he meets  the  financial  requirements
    set out in E-LTRP.3.1 with reference to the  'specified  evidence'  set
    out in Appendix FM-SE. In this case the Secretary of  State  considered
    that Mr Riaz was unable to do either. His  leave  to  remain  had  been
    curtailed prior to the application  being  made,  because  of  the  ETS
    allegation, and although evidence had been supplied  showing  household
    income to be above the minimum income requirement of  �18,600,  it  had
    not been provided in the specified form. The  only  way  that  Mr  Riaz
    could therefore succeed under the Rules would be by showing that he met
    the requirements in EX.1.  This, in short, required him  to  show  that
    there were 'insurmountable obstacles' to family life continuing outside
    of the United Kingdom. Although that form of words should not  be  read
    literally, the  courts  have  repeatedly  emphasised  that  this  is  a
    stringent test: R (on the application of Agyarko)(FC)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11.  It  is  now  defined  at
    EX.2 of Appendix FM:


         "For the purposes of paragraph EX.1(b)  'insurmountable  obstacles'
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."


14.  In its determination the First-tier Tribunal did not address this test
    at all. This was possibly because Mr Hussain did not pursue it with any
    vigour. The highest that the  evidence  could  be  put  was  this.  The
    sponsor Mrs Riaz does not like Pakistan. Although she is  of  Pakistani
    heritage she has been there only once in her adult life and stayed only
    a short time. This was a trip for her brother's wedding. She  does  not
    want to live there. It is trite law that Article 8 does not confer upon
    couples a choice about where they live. The fact that Mrs Riaz does not
    want to  live  in  Pakistan  does  not  amount  to  an  'insurmountable
    obstacle'. The other factor of potential relevance to EX.1 is the  fact
    that Mrs Riaz is currently undergoing fertility treatment  in  the  UK.
    This is a matter to which I return below, in the context of  Article  8
    'outside of the rules', but I am not satisfied that it is a matter that
    I could properly take into account when considering whether  there  are
    any 'insurmountable obstacles' to family life continuing  in  Pakistan,
    for the simple reason that such  treatment  is,  as  I  understand  it,
    available in that country.   In  the  absence  of  any  other  possible
    reasons why relocation might involve very serious hardship  for  either
    Mr or Mrs Riaz, I proceed on the basis that the  requirements  of  EX.1
    are not met and that the application must fail under the Rules.

15. I am satisfied that there is a genuine family life in  this  case.  The
    First-tier Tribunal found that Mr and Mrs Riaz have been in  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship for a number of years, and they  have  been
    validly married under English law since the 5th November 2013. I accept
    that the refusal of leave, and the attendant  requisite  that  Mr  Riaz
    should leave the United Kingdom, would amount to an  interference  with
    that family life.

16. There is no dispute that the Secretary of State holds the legal  powers
    to take such a decision, or that it is taken in pursuit of one or  more
    of the legitimate aims set out in  Article  8(2):  in  the  context  of
    immigration control that aim would be the protection of the economy.

17. The question remains whether the decision would  be  proportionate.  In
    determining this matter I am required to weigh the rights of  Mr  Riaz,
    and the consequences for him, against the public interest  in  removing
    persons who do not have leave to remain. My starting point must be  the
    factors set out in s117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002 (as amended).

18. The maintenance of immigration control is in the  public  interest.  Mr
    Riaz does not currently meet the requirements of the Rules and  he  has
    not held valid leave since the  24th  October  2014:  this  must  weigh
    against  him  in  the  balance.   Ordinarily  that  weight   would   be
    substantial, but in  this  case  it  is  mitigated  by  the  particular
    circumstances.  I must bear in mind that Mr Riaz entered  this  country
    with lawful leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  and  properly
    renewed that leave when required to do so.  On the  24th  October  2014
    the Secretary of State's decided to curtail that  leave  on  the  basis
    that Mr Riaz had relied on a  fraudulently  procured  English  language
    test certificate.  That  decision  has  been  held  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be wrong. The Secretary of State did not have the  evidence
    to warrant curtailment.  But for that erroneous decision Mr Riaz  would
    have held valid leave at the time that  he  made  his  application  for
    leave to remain as a spouse. But for that erroneous decision  he  would
    still be lawfully in the UK today: his Tier 4 leave  had  been  due  to
    expire on the 30th April 2015 and  his  human  rights  application  was
    lodged on the 20th February 2015; he  would  therefore  currently  have
    leave conferred by section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

19. It is in the public interest that persons who wish  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom can  speak  English,  because  this  better  aids  their
    integration. I accept and find as fact that Mr Riaz can speak  English.
    This is not therefore a matter that weighs against him.

20. It is in the public interest that persons who wish  to  remain  in  the
    United  Kingdom  are   financially   independent,   because   financial
    independence better aids their  integration.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    found that the household  income  in  this  case  was  well  above  the
    'minimum income' requirement set out in section E-LTRP.3.1 of  Appendix
    FM. I accept that Mr Riaz is financially self- sufficient. This  matter
    does not therefore weigh against him in the balance.

21. Section 117B (4) mandates that I can attach only a little weight  to  a
    relationship with a qualifying partner established whilst Mr  Riaz  was
    in this country unlawfully.  That  provision  does  not  apply  to  the
    relationship with Mrs Riaz,  since  they  were  married  when  Mr  Riaz
    indisputably held lawful leave to remain. Their English  marriage  took
    place on the 5th November 2013 and their  nikah  predated  that.    The
    First-tier Tribunal found as fact that this is a genuine and subsisting
    relationship and having heard from the parties myself I  do  not  doubt
    that. Mrs Riaz gave evidence that they had believed that  it  would  be
    straightforward for Mr Riaz to switch categories so as to obtain  leave
    to remain as a spouse. At the time of their  marriage  they  had  every
    reason to believe that would be possible: he had leave,  theirs  was  a
    genuine relationship  and  their  income  was  above  the  Appendix  FM
    threshold. This is not therefore a case where the parties entered  into
    a relationship knowing that one or other of  them  was  without  leave.
    They married in good faith that they would be able to obtain permission
    to remain living in this country. I therefore  attach  some  weight  to
    their relationship, whilst bearing in  mind  the  limitations  thereof,
    given the European jurisprudence  on  relationships  established  under
    'precarious' circumstances: see for instance Rodrigues da Silva  v  The
    Netherlands (2007) 44 EHRR 729.

22. I am required to only attach a little weight to any private  life  that
    Mr Riaz has established whilst  living  in  the  UK  with  'precarious'
    status. His status has always been precarious and  I  therefore  attach
    only a little weight to the private life (friends, study,  work,  home,
    wider family members) that he has established since he came to live  in
    the United Kingdom in October 2009.

23. The couple do not yet have any children so I disregard s117B(6) for the
    purpose of this decision.

24. In addition to these statutory considerations I find there  to  be  two
    other matters which assume some significance in the balancing exercise.

25. The first is the fact that Mrs Riaz is receiving fertility treatment in
    the UK. As she  explained  in  her  unchallenged  oral  evidence,  this
    requires both mother and father to be present. At  the  hospital  where
    she is receiving the treatment the collection and  fertilization  takes
    place on the same day. She has been told that  her  husband's  physical
    presence in the UK is required for her to undergo a further cycle,  and
    I have no reason to doubt her evidence that she is  anxious  about  the
    process and relies heavily on the emotional  support  provided  by  her
    husband.  As I  note  above,  the  fact  that  she  is  receiving  this
    treatment is clearly not an 'insurmountable obstacle', but  it  is  one
    that attracts some weight in my deliberations. Mrs Riaz  is  a  British
    national who is entitled to be receiving that  treatment  on  the  NHS.
    Her desire and efforts to have a child are of paramount  importance  to
    her, and form an important component of her Article 8 family life  with
    her husband, read with Article 12 ECHR, the right to marry and found  a
    family. If Mr Riaz were to leave  the  United  Kingdom  that  treatment
    would be substantially interfered with. Mrs Riaz is 35 years old with a
    diagnosis of endometriosis. She is  well  aware  that  the  longer  she
    leaves it the harder it will be to become pregnant.   Having heard  her
    evidence, and having applied the principles in Beoku-Betts v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 39, that is a matter  that
    I attach some weight to.


26. In respect of the second matter I return  to  the  Rules.  It  will  be
    recalled (see paragraph 7 above) that the only reason left for refusing
    leave under the Rules was the inability of Mrs Riaz to produce a letter
    from her employer confirming that she had  a  permanent  contract.  Mrs
    Riaz had, the  First-tier  Tribunal  held,  earned  over  the  required
    minimum for some years, but she failed  to  meet  this  requirement  of
    Appendix FM-SE because her employer chose to  offer  her  what  was  in
    effect full time work on a 'zero hours' contact. That decision had  two
    serious consequences for Mrs Riaz. First it denied her basic employment
    rights to which she might otherwise be entitled, second it  meant  that
    she could not provide the mandatory documents required  to  secure  her
    husband leave to remain.  As Judge Simpson noted below, a  'near  miss'
    argument under the Rules cannot be determinative in the proportionality
    balancing exercise, but such a factor can legitimately be considered as
    part of the overall assessment as to whether a fair  balance  has  been
    struck.   I do not however consider that this factor should  be  framed
    as a 'near miss' argument. Rather the focus of my enquiry should be  on
    the fact that the household income in this  case  was  accepted  to  be
    comfortably above the required minimum. In R (on the application of  MM
    (Lebanon) and Others) (Appellants) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department (Respondent) [2017] UKSC 10 the Supreme Court held that  the
    minimum  income  requirement  was  lawful,   but   held   that   overly
    prescriptive rules on  how  compliance  with  it  can  be  demonstrated
    widened the scope for  consideration  of  Article  8  'outside  of  the
    rules':


         "As has been seen, avoiding a financial burden on the state can  be
         relevant to the fair balance required  by  the  article.  But  that
         judgment cannot properly be constrained by a rigid  restriction  in
         the rules. Certainly, nothing that is said in the  instructions  to
         case officers can prevent the tribunal on appeal  from  looking  at
         the matter more broadly. These are not matters of policy  on  which
         special weight has to be accorded to the judgment of the  Secretary
         of State. There is nothing to prevent the tribunal, in the  context
         of the HRA appeal, from judging for itself the reliability  of  any
         alternative sources of finance in the light of the evidence  before
         it".


27. I have considered all of the abovementioned factors.   Having done so I
    come  firmly  to  the  view  that  a  denial  of  leave  would  not  be
    proportionate  in  this  case.    The  factual  matrix  before  me   is
    substantially different from that applied by  the  Secretary  of  State
    when she took her decision. The Secretary of State has been  unable  to
    show that Mr Riaz committed ETS fraud. Mr Riaz has demonstrated that he
    is in a genuine relationship, and  that  the  family  are  economically
    secure. The Supreme Court in MM  (Lebanon)  has  cautioned  against  an
    overly  rigid  approach  to  how  such  financial  security  might   be
    demonstrated. Mrs Riaz has satisfied me that it is extremely  important
    to her to have her husband with her so that she  can  found  a  family.
    All of these  matters  considered  alongside  the  public  interest,  I
    conclude that a refusal of  leave  would  be  disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim pursued and the appeal must be allowed.


    Decisions


28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of  law  such
    that the decision must be set aside to the  limited  extent  identified
    above.


29. The decision is remade as follows:  the  appeal  is  allowed  on  human
    rights grounds.


30. There is no direction for anonymity.

                                                           20th October 2017
