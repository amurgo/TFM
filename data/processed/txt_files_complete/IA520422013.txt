                            DECISION  AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against a determination promulgated before the First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Scott-Baker) promulgated on 3  September  2014  in
    which she allowed an appeal against the respondent's decision dated  21
    November 2013 refusing leave to remain and making  removal  directions,
    on the basis that the decisions were not in accordance  with  the  law.
    For ease of reference I shall refer to the parties as follows, to  "the
    Secretary of State" who is the appellant and to "the Claimant."

Background

2.   The Claimant whose date of birth is 28 December 1985 and is  a  citizen
    of Pakistan.

3.   Under Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  Migrant  provisions  the  Claimant  was
    required to show evidence of maintenance and fees to  cover  the  first
    academic year for his course (human geography)  which  was  for  twelve
    months or more.  The Claimant needed to show he was  in  possession  of
    �14,700 for a consecutive  28  day  period.   The  Secretary  of  State
    considered the evidence and concluded that between  13  September  2013
    and 26 September 2013 the Claimant's bank statement showed  he  was  in
    possession of no more than �13,944.09.  The figure for the tuition  fee
    was �15,000.

4.   At the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  Claimant  produced
    evidence in the form of a letter dated 5 December  2013  from  Jonathan
    Lloyd, head of the  Doctoral  Research  Office  at  the  University  of
    Reading, which stated that on 3 December  2013  the  PhD  programme  in
    human geography had been reclassified  by  the  university  as  a  non-
    laboratory subject which meant that the tuition fee  had  been  reduced
    from �15,000 to �12,600 for the academic  year  2013/14.   It  was  the
    Claimant's case that the correct fee was �12,600 and that  he  met  the
    financial requirements.

5.   The Tribunal found that this evidence was post decision  and  therefore
    not admissible under Section  85A  of  the  Nationality  Immigration  &
    Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 act").  However, there was an email dated 18
    November 2013 which was a request from the  Claimant  asking  that  his
    course fee should be reduced �12,600 as opposed to �15,000  per  annum,
    because it was  a  non  laboratory  subject.   The  Tribunal  expressed
    sympathy for the Claimant and considered  that  the  structure  of  the
    Immigration Rules prevented further  evidence  from  being  taken  into
    account and which resulted in fundamental unfairness to  the  Claimant.
    The Tribunal concluded  that the decision made was  not  in  accordance
    with the law and that the application should  be  reconsidered  by  the
    Secretary of State under her inherent discretionary powers. The  appeal
    was allowed to the extent that it was  remitted  to  the  Secretary  of
    State for reconsideration.

Grounds of Application

6.   The Secretary of State argued that the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    its assessment of "fairness."  There was no fundamental  unfairness  to
    the Claimant in this case, as he could not meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules.

7.   The Claimant did not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    and the appeal was bound to  be  dismissed.   The  Tribunal  could  not
    "cure" the Claimant's shortfall in funds  by  applying  a  "near  miss"
    principle; Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261.  Nor did the evidence disclose any
    issue of unfairness in the respondent's  approach  to  the  application
    that was made; Thakur (PBS Decision - Common Law  Fairness)  Bangladesh
    [2011] UKUT 00151 IAC.  At the date of  the  application  the  Claimant
    simply did not have the necessary  minimum  level  of  funds  to  cover
    maintenance and the course fees; it was immaterial that his college had
    decided after the date of decision to charge him a lower figure by  way
    of course fees.

Permission

8.   Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge J M  Holmes  on  20
    October 2014.  Judge Holmes granted permission on the grounds that  the
    determination  arguably  "fails  to  identify  any   feature   in   the
    appellant's   circumstances   of   sufficient   substance   to   render
    disproportionate the decision to remove  the  appellant;  Patel  [2013]
    UKSC 72 and Nasim [2014] UKUT 25".

The Hearing
Preliminary issue

9.    Mr Ahmed sought to call the Claimant to give oral  evidence  in  order
    to clarify the findings made in paragraph 8 of the decision.

10.  I refused this application. I  reminded  Mr  Ahmed  that  this  was  an
    initial hearing to consider whether or not there was an  error  of  law
    and that reference must be made to the evidence  that  was  before  the
    First-Tier Tribunal. It was  not  procedurally  correct  for  new  oral
    evidence to be given by the Claimant at this stage.

Submissions

11.  Miss Holmes relied on the grounds of  appeal  and  submitted  that  the
    judge had effectively applied a "near miss" principle.  No  fundamental
    unfairness  had  been  identified.    The   appellant   submitted   his
    application confirming that his fee was �15,000.  The Tribunal erred by
    remitting the matter to the Secretary of State  for  discretion  to  be
    exercised where there was no discretion.

12.   Mr  Ahmed  submitted  that  the  Tribunal  had  made  errors  in   the
    determination. He was instructed late and was  not  in  a  position  to
    produce or refine a response under Rule 24.  In any event, it  was  his
    submission that documents in the bundle (at pages 21 and 22)  had  been
    overlooked by the Secretary of State.   These  documents  were  printed
    from the Reading University website and referred to both sets  of  fees
    for the proposed course of study.  He submitted that this was  evidence
    to show that the two sets of  figures  were  available  in  the  public
    domain.  The Secretary of State ought to have been aware of  this  fact
    and taken it into account when reaching her decision.

13.  Mr Ahmed accepted that this documentary evidence was  not  specifically
    relied on before the First-tier Tribunal.

14.  As regards the discretionary  powers  available  to  the  Secretary  of
    State Mr Ahmed submitted that the Secretary of State  had  an  inherent
    discretionary power.

15.  Further, it was submitted that  the  Tribunal  was  bound  to  consider
    whether the decision is compliant with the Human Rights Act and  within
    the scope of Article 8, the issue was not one of  "near  miss"  but  an
    issue of fairness.

16.  In response Miss Holmes submitted that the Claimant himself had  stated
    in his application  form  that  the  fees  were  �15,000.   The  letter
    confirmed that the fees had been reclassified on 3 December 2013  which
    was post decision. There was no requirement for the Secretary of  State
    to seek out  further information as regards the fees.  No case law  had
    been produced to show that the  Secretary  of  State  had  an  inherent
    discretion in Tier 1.

17.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Discussion and Decision

18.  There are two issues in  this  matter  which  are  material.   Firstly,
    whether or not the Claimant suffered any fundamental  unfairness  as  a
    result of the Secretary of State's decision  and  if  so,  whether  the
    Secretary of State has an inherent discretionary power under the points-
    based scheme.

19.  The Tribunal considered the evidence and concluded  that  the  relevant
    Immigration  Rules  were  not   met.    Understandably   the   Tribunal
    sympathised for the Claimant's situation whereby he would have met  the
    financial requirements of the Rules in  the  event  that  the  fee  was
    �12,600. However, I am  satisfied  that  at  the  time  of  making  the
    application  he  understood  that  the  fee  was   �15,000  per  annum.
    Although it would seem that an email was sent to the Secretary of State
    prior to the date of decision indicating  that  there  was  a  possible
    alteration to the level of fees, this matter was  not  pursued  by  the
    Claimant nor investigated further by the Secretary  of  State.   It  is
    accepted that the  Claimant,  when  completing  the  application  form,
    referred to fees in the sum of �15,000.  The post decision evidence put
    before the Tribunal was a letter dated 5 December 2013 referring  to  a
    re-classification of the fees in the sum of �12,600 as from 3  December
    2013.  There was no independent evidence to confirm that the  fees  had
    been re-classified prior to that date.  I reject the submission made by
    Mr Ahmed that the Secretary of State was under a  duty  to  investigate
    the fee levels and that had she done so would have  seen  reference  to
    two sets of fees on the University of Reading's website.  It  may  well
    be that such material was in the public domain.  However, the Secretary
    of State is under no duty to pursue such  enquiries  on  behalf  of  an
    applicant.  The fact of the matter is at the time the  application  was
    made and considered the Claimant failed to show that he had  sufficient
    funds to meet the requirements of the Rules.  There was  no  procedural
    or other fundamental unfairness on the part of the Secretary of  State.
    The Claimant's situation was simply unfair because  of  the  subsequent
    change in fee, but it was not unfair in the legal sense  as  identified
    the   Upper   Tribunal   in   Marghia(procedural    fairness)[2014]UKUT
    00366(IAC).

20.  As to the secondary ground of appeal concerning the discretion, UCAS  v
    ECO (Discretion: When Reviewable) [2012] UKUT established  the  general
    principles and see Abdi [1996] Imm AR 148.  This appeal related to  the
    points-based scheme which allows  for  no  discretion.   Further  I  am
    satisfied that the Claimant has not identified any specific or inherent
    discretion that the Secretary of State arguably failed  to  apply.  Any
    exercise of residual discretion is a matter for the Secretary of State.



21.  There was no argument put on the basis that Article 8 ECHR applied  and
    having regard to the issues and evidence there  is  no  ground  for  an
    Article  8  consideration  following  Patel(cited  above)   and   Nasim
    [2014]UKUT 25.


Decision
22.  There  was  a  material  error  of  law  in   the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision.  That decision is set aside.

23.   I substitute a decision to dismiss the appeal on  immigration  grounds
    and on human rights grounds.
