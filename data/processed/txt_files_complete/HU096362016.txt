                            DECISION AND REASONS



Background

 1. The appellant in this case is the Secretary of State and the respondent
    is Mr Carlton Lewis Roper, a national of Jamaica, born on  17  December
    1962.  However for the purposes of this decision and reasons I refer to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal where Mr  Roper
    was the appellant.

 2. Mr Roper entered the UK on 29  September  1988  as  a  visitor.   On  3
    December 2015 he applied for leave to remain on the basis of his family
    and private life. The respondent considered the appellant's application
    under Paragraph 276ADE On 31 March  2016  the  respondent  refused  his
    application, on the sole ground that the appellant fell for refusal  on
    the suitability grounds.  Mr Roper appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.
     The First-tier Tribunal allowed the appellant's appeal in  a  decision
    promulgated on 12 October 2017.

 3. The Secretary of State appealed on the following grounds:

    Ground 1:     that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  reversed  the
    burden of proof at  paragraph  [16],  attributing  the  burden  to  the
    respondent.

    Ground 2:     It was contended that the First-tier Tribunal had  failed
    to provide adequate reasons for concluding that the appellant  did  not
    present a risk of further offending, had given no consideration to  the
    nature of his offences and had failed to make a broad assessment  given
    the relevant factors that can include "character, associations or other
    reasons".   It  was  submitted  that  the   Tribunal   had   materially
    misdirected itself at paragraph [23] in stating that the  Secretary  of
    State had not  pointed  to  any  public  interest  in  the  appellant's
    exclusion.  It was further contended that the assessment at  paragraphs
    [25] and [26] failed to provide  cogent  reasoning  and  did  not  give
    explicit consideration to other sources of support for the partner.



Preliminary Issue

 4. The First-tier Tribunal permission judge, on 2 November  2017,  granted
    permission as it was arguable that the judge had erred in  placing  the
    burden  of  proof  upon  the  respondent.   Ms  Nollet  contended  that
    therefore the further grounds  of  appeal  were  not  arguable.   As  I
    indicated at the hearing that is not  the  case;  where  permission  to
    appeal limits the grounds of appeal, this  should  be  made  explicitly
    clear, including by issuing the  appropriate  notices  to  the  parties
    informing the applicant of the right to apply to the Upper Tribunal for
    permission to appeal  on  grounds  on  which  the  applicant  has  been
    unsuccessful in the  application  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   (see
    Ferrer (limited appeal grounds; Alvi)  [2012]  UKUT  00304  (IAC)).   I
    considered all grounds arguable.



Error of Law Discussion

 5. Although Ms Ahmad did not  specifically  concede  the  appeal  she  was
    unable to point to any authority which might support her claim that the
    burden of proof in demonstrating that an applicant was not conducive to
    the public good was on the appellant rather than  the  respondent.   Ms
    Ahmad relied on Bossadi (paragraph 276ADE;  suitability;  ties)  [2015]
    UKUT  41  (IAC)  and  noted  that  an  individual  needs  to  meet  the
    suitability requirements.  However she  was  unable  to  point  to  any
    authority in relation to the suitability  requirements  which  were  in
    issue before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  S-LTR.1.6  (as  identified  at
    paragraphs [5] and [19] of the decision and reasons).

 6.  S-LTR.1.6 of Appendix FM provides as follows:

         "The presence of the applicant in the UK is not  conducive  to  the
         public good because their conduct (including convictions  which  do
         not   fall   within    paragraphs    S-LTR.1.3-1.5.),    character,
         associations, or other reasons, make it undesirable to allow him to
         remain in the UK."

 7. Ms Nollet relied on JC (Part 9 HC395, burden  of  proof)  China  [2017]
    UKAIT 00027 including at paragraphs 10 to 14 which  confirmed  that  in
    relation to the general grounds of refusal the burden of  proof  is  on
    the decision maker to establish the precedent  facts  relied  on.   The
    general grounds have an exclusionary rather  than  inclusionary  intent
    and an applicant who does not show why they qualify rather the decision
    maker is seeking to show why they  should  be  disqualified.   Although
    this does not relate specifically to the  suitability  requirements  in
    Appendix FM the suitability grounds for refusal are  analogous  and  Ms
    Ahmad  was  unable  to  point  to  any  authority  for  an  alternative
    proposition.

 8. Ms Ahmad submitted that although  the  respondent  had  the  burden  to
    establish that the behaviour  claimed  of  occurred,  the  burden  then
    switched to the appellant.  Even if that were the case and  the  burden
    switches to the appellant, to show why it is not undesirable  for  them
    to remain in the UK, the First-tier Tribunal's findings  indicate  that
    the appellant provided evidence  in  relation  to  the  nature  of  the
    convictions and his life and character generally.  It is evidence  that
    the appellant discharged any burden on him.  Any  error  therefore,  at
    [16], in stating that the burden of proof was with the  respondent  was
    not material.  Indeed Ms Ahmad could see no reason to suggest that  the
    Tribunal had erred in refusing an adjournment prior to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (when the  appellant's  representatives  requested  additional
    time to produce further evidence of the appellant's convictions).   The
    Tribunal in refusing that adjournment reminded the parties that it  was
    for the respondent to establish  with  evidence  that  the  suitability
    condition applies.

 9. I take into consideration the Tribunal had before it  an  extract  from
    the respondent's guidance in relation to the  suitability  requirements
    including that "it is possible for an applicant to meet the suitability
    requirements, even where there is some  low-level  criminality"  and  I
    accept Ms Nollet's argument that the judge had this guidance in mind.

10. Although  the  Tribunal  might  ideally  have  phrased  paragraph  [16]
    differently, there was ultimately no error in the judge's  approach  to
    the burden of proof.

11. In relation to the remaining grounds,  I  am  of  the  view  that  they
    disclose nothing more than a disagreement  with  the  findings  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The appellant had provided evidence including  of
    the supportive role he played in his partner's life  and  that  of  his
    family and provided evidence, which the Tribunal accepted,  that  there
    had been no further offending since 2011.

12. Although it was submitted that the Tribunal had failed to  engage  with
    the nature of the convictions at [24], that is precisely what the judge
    did at [20] where the Tribunal set out the three offences.  In 1992 the
    appellant was convicted for possession of controlled drugs when he  was
    fined �150 and costs of  �25;  the  second  offence  of  possessing  an
    offensive weapon where he was  fined  �100,  which  took  place  on  19
    January 2005 and the third conviction for using threatening abusive and
    insulting words or behaviour on 2 December 2011 for which he was  given
    100 hours of community service and costs of �100 were  awarded  against
    him.

13. The Tribunal also took into consideration the gap between the offences;
    there was no error in that approach.  Although the respondent indicated
    that it was precisely the gap between the offending which needed to  be
    taken into consideration it cannot be  said  that  the  judge  did  not
    consider all the material factors including the substantial  period  of
    time between the offences.  The Tribunal considered that  none  of  the
    offences showed any particular pattern and that  the  Tribunal  had  no
    reason to doubt the appellant's account  as  set  out  in  the  witness
    statement in relation  to  the  circumstances  of  the  offences.   The
    Tribunal also took into consideration that the appellant was  genuinely
    remorseful and,  in  the  Tribunal's  view  unlikely  to  repeat  these
    offences.  It was also open to the Tribunal to take into account  that,
    in addition to no further offending, the appellant had not come to  the
    attention  of  the  police  since  2011.   The  Tribunal  set  out  the
    appellant's evidence including that he was  now  more  mature  and  had
    provided a recent example of avoiding confrontation and temptation  and
    the Tribunal, at [21] and [22], accepted his account.

14. It cannot be properly said that the judge did not give adequate reasons
    for the conclusions reached and Ms Ahmad conceded that the high bar  of
    irrationality was not reached in this case.   The  Tribunal  also  took
    into consideration that the sentences were relatively  light,  again  a
    finding which was open to the Tribunal.

15. Although the grounds of appeal took issue with the Tribunal's  findings
    in relation to the positive contribution that the appellant  had  made,
    including to his partner and family and in assisting the  partner  with
    her illness, as it was argued that there was no explicit  consideration
    of other social support that the partner could have including  extended
    family and local authority assistance, that was not the purpose of  the
    consideration that the Tribunal undertook;  this  formed  part  of  the
    wider consideration of the  appellant's  character  required  under  S-
    LTR.1.6, rather than  any  availability  of  alternative  care  if  the
    appellant were  not  in  the  UK  (which  was  not  at  issue  in  that
    consideration).  I take into account that it was agreed by the  parties
    before the First-tier Tribunal (paragraph  [5])  that  the  only  issue
    before the Tribunal was suitability.  Even if that were not the case  ,
    a person's value to the community is a factor which may be legitimately
    be considered in the Article 8 proportionality balancing exercise  (see
    Lama (video recorded evidence - weight - Art 8 ECHR) [2017] UKUT  00016
    (IAC))
