Representation:

For the claimant: Ms T Murtaz, instructed by Crown Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, KIO, date of birth 29.1.78, is a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lowe  promulgated  10.6.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of Stake, dated
    10.9.13, to refuse the claimant's application made on 23.7.13 for leave
    to remain in the UK on the basis of article 8 ECHR, and the decision of
    12.9.13 to remove him from the UK by way of directions under section 47
    of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 21.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Plumptre  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    28.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Lowe should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be summarised as  follows.  The  claimant's
    wife is Zimbabwean and their two children were born in the UK. She  has
    discretionary leave to remain in the UK and has been here for  some  11
    years. They 'married' in a traditional ceremony in the UK in 2006.  The
    claimant is settled in Nigeria, where he  has  a  business,  but  makes
    business visa visits to the UK for up to 180 days at  a  time.  He  had
    apparently lived in the UK previously for some 8 years.

 7. The application was considered under Appendix FM and  paragraph  276ADE
    of the Immigration Rules. Because of both his and his wife's status  he
    could not qualify under the FM eligibility requirements as  a  partner.
    Similarly, because of the status of his children, he does  not  qualify
    as the parent of a child. In relation to 276ADE he could  not  show  he
    had lost  all  ties  to  Nigeria.  The  Secretary  of  State  found  no
    exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances  in  his  case.   Thus   the
    application was refused.

 8. In the First-tier Tribunal Judge Lowe concluded at �32 that  there  are
    exceptional circumstances justifying a grant of discretionary leave  to
    the claimant and that returning him to Nigeria  would  be  unreasonably
    harsh and disproportionate.

 9. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  submit  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in the approach taken to article  8  ECHR  by
    failing to apply the Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) approach  and  did
    not  identify  any  compelling  circumstances  to  justify  considering
    article 8 outside the Immigration Rules. It is also submitted that  the
    judge failed to identify insurmountable obstacles to continuing  family
    life outside the UK and failed to take into account in  the  article  8
    proportionality balancing exercise factors  in  favour  of  the  public
    interest in removal.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Plumptre considered it arguable
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in her application of  article
    8 case law and failed to  give  sufficient  weight  to  the  claimant's
    continuing ties to Nigeria. "Further it may be arguable that the  judge
    erred by giving insufficient weight to the fact that the  appellant  is
    not legally married, and that his wife from Zimbabwe and  two  children
    born in the UK are not British citizens and have discretionary  limited
    leave only, and  hence  erred  in  her  assessment  of  compelling  and
    compassionate circumstances. Whilst in my judgement the outcome may not
    be any different on the facts of this appeal, permission to  appeal  is
    granted on all grounds."

11. At the hearing the claimant's representative conceded that the claimant
    could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM or paragraph  276ADE  of
    the Immigration Rules.

12. There is little merit in the first part of the grounds in  relation  to
    Gulshan compelling circumstances. The judge referenced Gulshan  at  �23
    and set out what she considered to be compelling circumstances. At  �24
    the judge stated,  "I  consider  that  there  are  reasons  why  it  is
    important to assess whether there are arguably good grounds for a grant
    of discretionary leave outside the Immigration Rules," followed by  the
    reasons, which included a lengthy assessment of the best  interests  of
    the children and related case law.

13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge is required in accordance with section 86
    of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  to  determine  the
    appeal on the grounds advanced. To do otherwise would be a breach of  a
    statutory requirement. A failure to consider the article 8 claim  would
    be likely to render the decision non-compliant with section  6  of  the
    Human Rights Act 1998. However, the judge did not in fact go on to make
    an article 8 assessment but seems to have concluded that because  there
    were in her  view  exceptional  circumstances,  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed,  and   stopped   short   at   �32,   without   undertaking   a
    proportionality  balancing  exercise.  The  decision  reads  as  though
    incomplete.

14. In particular, there was no assessment of the five Razgar steps, and it
    is difficult to see how the  judge  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    decision was disproportionate and unreasonably harsh. More importantly,
    even if an article 8 assessment can be divined from the  determination,
    it is clear that several factors in favour of removal of  the  claimant
    were left out of the balancing exercise and ignored.

15. For example, there was  little  consideration  to  the  fact  that  the
    claimant's wife and children have only temporary status in the  UK  and
    thus no guarantee that they will  be  able  to  remain.  There  was  no
    consideration that there is a route for  entry  under  the  Immigration
    Rules but the claimant has been unable to meet those requirements. When
    entering into their relationship and in having children in the UK, they
    must be taken to have realised that their  status  was  precarious  and
    they had no  legitimate  expectation  of  being  able  to  remain.  The
    claimant came to the UK on a business visa, which does not entitle  him
    to settle in the  UK.  Given  his  history  of  shuttling  between  his
    business in Nigeria and family in the UK, there is  no  reason  why  he
    should not return to Nigeria and make application for entry from there,
    maintaining contact with his family as he has done in the past, through
    modern means of communication.

16.  There  was  no  adequate  assessment  as   to   whether   there   were
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  spouse  and  children  joining  the
    claimant in Nigeria and continuing family  life  there.  There  was  no
    evidence that had even been considered by the husband and wife  or  any
    enquiries made of  the  authorities  as  to  that  possibility,  or  of
    residence in either Nigeria or Zimbabwe. In essence,  their  desire  to
    remain in the UK is by choice and not of necessity.  However,  she  was
    not required to leave as a result of this decision by the Secretary  of
    State and there was no evidence that she could not adequately  continue
    to care for the children in his absence, as she has been  doing.  There
    was inadequate consideration of the  fact  that  the  parties  are  not
    legally married and that neither the claimant's wife  or  children  are
    British citizens or settled in the UK.  Neither  was  there  sufficient
    consideration of the extent of the claimant's ties to Nigeria, where he
    has lived most of his life and where  he  operates  his  business.  The
    weight given to the best interests of the children when they  had  only
    temporary status was misplaced. The judge failed to take  into  account
    that they were not British citizens and had Zimbabwean passports.   The
    judge appears to have drawn analogy with refugees,  which  is  not  the
    situation of the claimant, his wife, or children. Further, just because
    the claimant is not a criminal or has complied with  Immigration  Rules
    hitherto  does  not  provide  any  basis  to  outweigh  the  need   for
    immigration control. Little regard was given to the legitimate  aim  of
    protecting the  economic  well-being  of  the  UK  through  Immigration
    Control in any balancing exercise. None of the above  appears  to  have
    taken into consideration and the result was thus a rather  a  one-sided
    and unduly sympathetic assessment. If  these  other  factors  had  been
    weighed in the balance, it was necessary to  demonstrate  that  in  the
    determination; a party should be able to see from the determination why
    they have lost the appeal.

17. In all the circumstances, for the  reasons  stated,  I  find  that  the
    assessment of the First-tier Tribunal Judge was inadequate and  flawed,
    such that the determination cannot stand and  must  be  set  aside  and
    remade.

Conclusions:

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I remit the appeal to be reheard in the First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

19. The appeal will be reheard in the First-tier Tribunal at Stoke on Trent
    on 17.2.15, with an estimate of 2 hours.

20. I preserve the evidential summary set out between �7  and  �18  of  the
    determination of Judge Lowe, but give leave to the  parties  to  adduce
    further evidence to bring private and family life circumstances  up  to
    date for the rehearing of the appeal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be determined.
