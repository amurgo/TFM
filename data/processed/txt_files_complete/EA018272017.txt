	DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

	Of Upper Tribunal Judge Gleeson 

	Pursuant to Rule 40(3) of the 

	Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended)

		 

			Having considered the material before it, and with the consent of the parties, the Upper Tribunal has decided that the First-tier Tribunal made an error of law as identified in the grant of permission read with the grounds of appeal and that its decision should be set aside.

	

			The appeal will now proceed to the stage in which the First-tier Tribunal will remake the decision to allow or dismiss the appeal on the basis described in the grant of permission.



			The remaking of the appeal shall, if possible, take place at a London hearing centre, as the appellant is now living in Kingston-upon-Thames and his representatives are in West London also.
