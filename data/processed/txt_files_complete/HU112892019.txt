Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss E Harris, instructed by Buckingham Legal
                    Associates Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Andrew promulgated on 21 October  2019,  dismissing
    his appeal against a decision of the respondent made on 17 June 2019 to
    deport him as a foreign criminal  to  whom  Section  32(5)  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007 applies and to refuse his human rights claim.

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 2 June 2000 at the  age  of
    4, accompanied by his father.  He was later, on 17 July  2000,  granted
    indefinite leave to remain.

 3. The appellant did, at some point, return to Antigua for a short  period
    but has for the most of his life lived in the United Kingdom  lawfully.
    He has spent a significant part of his childhood in care and around the
    age of 13 received the relatively minor convictions.  He has,  however,
    obtained employment both before and after his conviction on 27  October
    2018 at Wood Green Crown Court of possessing dangerous weapons and  for
    which he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on 6 April  2018,  on
    five  counts  of  possession  of  a  weapon.   The  details  of   these
    convictions are set out in the refusal letter  and  in  the  sentencing
    remarks cited in Judge Andrew's decision at [5].  The judge had  before
    her bundles produced by both representatives.  She also heard  evidence
    from the  appellant,  his  partner  and  witness  statements  from  his
    partner's parents.  The judge found that:-

      i) the appellant is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with  his
         partner but at [26] it would not be unduly harsh for her to live in
         Antigua and Barbuda with the appellant nor would it be unduly harsh
         for her to remain in the United Kingdom without the appellant;

     ii) the appellant has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  for
         most of his life, had been schooled and worked here [31]  but  that
         he had not been socially and culturally integrated into the  United
         Kingdom because of his offending behaviour and lack of respect  for
         the criminal laws of the United Kingdom [32] to [33];

    iii)  further,  and  in  the  alternative.  there  would  not  be   very
         significant obstacles to his integration into Antigua  and  Barbuda
         given that he has relatives there, is in good physical  health  and
         there was no reason why he would be  unable  to  obtain  employment
         there [34] to [36], a psychiatric report notwithstanding;

     iv) although the appellant did not  satisfy  paragraphs  399  and  399A
         there were not very compelling circumstances over and  above  those
         set out in paragraphs 399 and 399A such that his deportation  would
         be disproportionate.

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal on two grounds:-

      i) the judge had misdirected herself in law as to  the  assessment  of
         whether the appellant was socially and culturally  integrated  into
         the United Kingdom contrary to Binbuga (Turkey) v SSHD [2019]  EWCA
         Civ 551 and that the  appellant  had  through  his  evidence  shown
         integration through full-time education, full-time employment and a
         multifaceted network in the United Kingdom, including a  cohabiting
         relationship with a British partner;

     ii) The  judge  has  misdirected  herself  with  regard  to  the  "very
         significant obstacles" test in failing properly  to  apply  SSHD  v
         Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813.

 5. On 13  January  2020  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Scott-Baker  granted
    permission on all grounds.

The Law

 6. In assessing the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  I  bear  in  mind
    that, as Miss Harris accepted, ground 1 is a perversity challenge.

    In Lowe v SSHD [2021] EWCA Civ 62 the Court of Appeal held at  [29]  to
    [32]:

         "29. At [114] - [115], Lewison  LJ  explained  the  caution  to  be
         exercised  by  appellate  courts  in  interfering  with  evaluative
         decisions of first instance judges.  Para.  [114]  is  particularly
         well known, but para. [115] is also of  relevance  to  the  present
         case.  The Lord Justice said this:

             "114.    Appellate courts  have  been  repeatedly  warned,  by
             recent cases at the  highest  level,  not  to  interfere  with
             findings of fact by trial judges, unless compelled to  do  so.
             This applies not only to findings of primary fact, but also to
             the evaluation of those facts and to inferences  to  be  drawn
             from them. The best known of these cases  are:  Biogen  Inc  v
             Medeva Plc [1997] RPC 1; Piglowska v Piglowski  [1999]  1  WLR
             1360; Datec Electronics Holdings Ltd v United Parcels  Service
             Ltd [2007] UKHL 23; [2007] 1 WLR 1325 ; Re B (A  Child)  (Care
             Proceedings) [2013] UKSC  33;  [2013]  1  WLR  1911  and  most
             recently and comprehensively McGraddie v McGraddie [2013] UKSC
             58; [2013] 1 WLR 2477 . These are all decisions either of  the
             House of Lords or of the Supreme Court. The reasons  for  this
             approach are many. They include

                  i.   The expertise of a trial judge is in determining what
                  facts are relevant to the legal issues to be decided,  and
                  what those facts are if they are disputed.

                  ii.  The trial is not a dress rehearsal. It is  the  first
                  and last night of the show.

                  iii. Duplication of the trial judge's role on appeal is  a
                  disproportionate  use  of  the  limited  resources  of  an
                  appellate court, and  will  seldom  lead  to  a  different
                  outcome in an individual case.

                  iv.  In making his decisions the  trial  judge  will  have
                  regard to the whole of the sea of  evidence  presented  to
                  him, whereas  an  appellate  court  will  only  be  island
                  hopping.

                  v.   The atmosphere of the courtroom cannot, in any event,
                  be  recreated  by  reference   to   documents   (including
                  transcripts of evidence).

                  vi.  Thus even if it were possible to duplicate  the  role
                  of the trial judge, it cannot in practice be done.

             115. It is also important to  have  in  mind  the  role  of  a
             judgment given after trial. The primary function  of  a  first
             instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal
             points  and  to  advance  reasons  for  deciding  them  in   a
             particular way. He  should  give  his  reasons  in  sufficient
             detail to show the parties and,  if  need  be,  the  Court  of
             Appeal the principles on which he has acted  and  the  reasons
             that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate.
             There is no duty on a judge, in giving his  reasons,  to  deal
             with every argument presented by counsel  in  support  of  his
             case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to
             support his view, not to spell out every matter as if  summing
             up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that
             are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says  shows  the
             basis on which he  has  acted.  These  are  not  controversial
             observations: see Customs and Excise Commissioners v A  [2002]
             EWCA Civ 1039; [2003] 2 WLR 210; Bekoe v Broomes  [2005]  UKPC
             39; Argos Ltd v Office of Fair Trading [2006] EWCA  Civ  1318;
             [2006] UKCLR 1135"

         30.  In this case, the FTT had  determined  the  issues  that  were
         before it, being those which were regarded as being central to  the
         question of whether the Appellant  had  demonstrated  the  relevant
         "very significant obstacles". It was not necessary for the  FTT  to
         deal with a case that was not being made  by  the  Respondent.  The
         appeal to the FTT was "the first and last night of the show", not a
         "dress rehearsal".

         31   Equally, it is to be recalled that judgments at first instance
         are necessarily an incomplete impression made upon the judge by the
         primary evidence. This FTT judge reached the conclusion that he did
         on the issues raised and he expressed himself succinctly  on  them.
         This is what Lord Hoffmann said on  the  point  in  the  well-known
         passage of his speech in the House of Lords in Biogen Inc. v Medeva
         plc [1997] RPC 1 at 45:

             "The need for  appellate  caution  in  reversing  the  judge's
             evaluation of the facts is based upon much more solid  grounds
             than professional courtesy. It is because specific findings of
             fact, even by the most meticulous  judge,  are  inherently  an
             incomplete statement of the impression which was made upon him
             by the primary evidence. His  expressed  findings  are  always
             surrounded by  a  penumbra  of  imprecision  as  to  emphasis,
             relative weight, minor  qualification  and  nuance  (as  Renan
             said, la v�rit� est  dans  une  nuance),  of  which  time  and
             language do not permit exact expression, but which may play an
             important part in the judge's overall evaluation...".

 7. Miss Harris accepted in submissions that the facts set out  in  Binbuga
    and, for that matter Bossade (ss.117A-D - interrelationship with Rules)
    [2015] UKUT 415 were distinguishable on their facts.  I agree.  Binbuga
    is concerned more with what a judge should not  take  into  account  in
    assessing whether an individual is socially and  culturally  integrated
    into the United Kingdom and the factual matrix there was  significantly
    different.  She submitted that there was perversity here,  in  that  no
    judge properly directed as  to  the  law  could  have  found  that  the
    appellant  was  not  socially  and  culturally  integrated,  given  his
    education, work history, current relationship, volunteering  and  other
    indicative factors, as well as the length of time he had spent  in  the
    United Kingdom since a very early age to the extent  that  he  was  not
    familiar with any other country.

 8. Miss Harris submitted further that the judge had erred in her  approach
    to Kamara and in particular had failed properly to attach  the  correct
    weight to the psychiatric report, there  being  good  reasons  why  the
    appellant had not disclosed the difficulties he had had in care and the
    subsequent anxiety and mental ill health to others and  on  that  basis
    the judge had erred in drawing a  distinction  between  what  had  been
    disclosed in supporting witness statements and what had been  disclosed
    to the psychiatrist.

 9. Mr Whitwell submitted that this was properly a perversity challenge and
    that that high test was not met.   He  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    clearly taken into account the appellant's education and  work  history
    and had attached significant weight to the appellant's attitude towards
    his offending to which he was entitled, given what was said in  Binbuga
    at [57] to [58]. He submitted  further  that  the  judge  had  properly
    applied Kamara and that it  was  significant  that  the  appellant  had
    disclosed no suicidal ideation to his GP in contrast to what  was  said
    to the psychiatrist.  In reply, Miss Harris submitted the judge had not
    taken into account what the appellant had done since imprisonment.  She
    accepted also that the appellant had been convicted  of  possession  of
    several weapons.

    Discussion

10.  The  assessment  of  whether  somebody  is  socially  and   culturally
    integrated is primarily one of fact.  It involves  consideration  of  a
    number of factors as can be seen from Binbuga.  That is  also  apparent
    from Bossade.  It is not in this case  suggested  that  the  judge  had
    misdirected herself in law, rather that her decision is perverse.  I do
    not accept that that is so.

11. In effect the challenge is one to the weight that the judge attached to
    the various factors relevant to the issue of whether the appellant  was
    socially and culturally integrated.  She  accepted  that  he  had  been
    educated here, worked here and had had a disturbed  childhood  and  had
    been in local authority care.  She was entitled to balance against that
    his criminal history and to take into account  the  previous  offences.
    It was also open to her to take into account  that  the  appellant  was
    less accepting of his offences than he was in the Crown Court; she  was
    entitled to take into account the appellant saying in evidence that  he
    had only found a bag containing knives and the taser, denying that  the
    taser was in his pocket. The seeking to diminish his culpability  is  a
    factor the judge was properly able to take into  account  in  assessing
    whether the appellant  is  integrated,  an  evaluation  which  includes
    looking at the appellant's attitude to criminality,  and  in  following
    the norms of civilised behaviour.

12. In the circumstances and bearing in mind  also  the  findings  made  in
    respect of "very compelling circumstances" that the appellant had  been
    assessed of low risk of serious  harm  to  the  community  although  of
    medium risk  to  the  public  and  had  taken  on  voluntary  work  and
    rehabilitative work, she was entitled to conclude  that  the  appellant
    was not socially and culturally integrated  because  of  his  offending
    behaviour and the lack of respect for the criminal laws of  the  United
    Kingdom.

13. That may well be a harsh decision; but that is not the test here; it is
    for the appellant to show that the judge's decision was so unreasonable
    that it could not have been made.  I am not satisfied that that is  so.
    In essence, the grounds simply argue issues of weight to be attached to
    the various factors, and that, absent perversity, was a matter for  the
    judge.

14. Accordingly, I found that ground 1 is not made out.  Given that  ground
    1 is not made out, it is unnecessary for me to  consider  ground  2  as
    that depends on ground 1 being made  out.   Further,  as  there  is  no
    challenge to the  finding  that  there  were  not  in  this  case  very
    compelling circumstances over and above exceptions 1 and 2 such that it
    would be disproportionate to deport the appellant,  it  is  unnecessary
    for me to consider that ground.  That is because the criteria  set  out
    in paragraph 399A are cumulative and, having failed to show that he  is
    socially and culturally integrated into the United Kingdom, whether  or
    not there would be obstacles is not relevant.

15. For these reasons, I conclude  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not involve the making of an error of law and I uphold it.





Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold it.
