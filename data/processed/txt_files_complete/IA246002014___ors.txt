Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Secretary of State. We shall refer to the  parties
    as in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  Appellants  were  born  on  5th
    September 1972, 30th December 1978, 1st June 2005 and 3rd October 2009.
    They are a husband, his wife and their two children and they are Indian
    nationals.
 2. Their appeals were allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott  on  18th
    March 2014  under  the  Immigration  Rules  in  respect  of  the  third
    Appellant, and on Article 8 grounds in respect of the first, second and
    fourth Appellants. The judge found that the third  Appellant  satisfied
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the  Immigration  Rules  and  therefore  the
    removal of the remaining Appellants  would  be  disproportionate  under
    Article 8.

3.   The Respondent appealed on the grounds that the  judge  had  failed  to
    apply binding case law or had failed to distinguish  the  cases  of  EV
    (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ 874 and Zoumbas [2013] UKSC  74,  and  he
    had failed to give reasons  why  he  had  departed  from  those  cases.
    Secondly, the judge  had  materially  misdirected  himself  in  law  in
    failing to give adequate weight to the public interest and the  factors
    highlighted in section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 [NIA], in particular the fact that none of the Appellants  had
    been legally resident in the UK since the  parent's  visas  expired  in
    2003 and 2004 and as such any private or family life  developed  during
    that time should be given  little  weight.  It  was  submitted  by  the
    Respondent that  the  judge's  findings  relating  to  whether  it  was
    reasonable for the third Appellant to leave the UK were speculative.

4.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever  on
    27th May 2015 on the grounds that the adult Appellants came to  the  UK
    as visitors and overstayed. Their children were born in the  UK  whilst
    they were here unlawfully.  The judge noted  the  concession  that  the
    case of the adult Appellants would be hopeless but for the presence  of
    the  children.  Although  the  judge  referred  to  the  cases  of   EV
    (Philippines) and Zoumbas, he appeared not to follow the  reasoning  in
    those cases.  It was arguable that he provided no reason why this  case
    should be so distinguished from those cases and why he did  not  follow
    the superior court's decisions when  considering,  in  particular,  the
    position of the third Appellant, from which then  flowed  a  favourable
    decision in respect of all four Appellants.


The Judge's findings

5.   In coming to his decision the judge  made  the  following  findings  at
    [29] to [32].


         "29. In assessing the third Appellant's best interests I note  that
             he was born in the United Kingdom on 1st June 2009 and  he  is
             now 9 years and 9 months old.  He has lived all  his  life  in
             the United Kingdom with his  family  and  has  never  been  to
             India. It was pointed out on his behalf  that  in  just  three
             months'  time  he  would  be  able  to   apply   for   British
             citizenship.  There is a wealth of evidence to demonstrate the
             extent of his private life and  integration  into  the  United
             Kingdom.  Although he has never had leave to  remain  and  his
             private life has been established while he has been present in
             the country unlawfully, that is not his fault.   He  was  born
             here and had no choice in the matter. He is not to be punished
             for the sins of his parents.


         30.  If removed to India the third Appellant's parents  would  have
             no employment and  no  qualifications  to  offer  on  the  job
             market. I accept that his father's  age  would  be  likely  to
             count against him in securing work.  I also accept that  there
             is extended family in India who would not be in a position  to
             assist him so that the third Appellant and  his  family  might
             well find themselves destitute and homeless on removal there.


         31.  The third Appellant is also well established at school in  the
             United Kingdom and it would clearly be in his  best  interests
             to remain in the education system here. There is of course  an
             education system in India  but  the  third  Appellant's  first
             language is English and, on the evidence before me, the medium
             of instruction in most schools in India is Gujarati or  Hindi.
             Although the third Appellant  is  able  to  speak  both  those
             languages to some extent because they are spoken at  home,  he
             is unable to write in them. In any event, it  is  doubtful  if
             the third Appellant's family would ever be able to  afford  to
             pay school fees in India and schools in which English  is  the
             medium of instruction are even more expensive.  It  is  likely
             therefore that the third Appellant's removal  to  India  would
             deprive him of further education of whatever quality.


         32.  Overall I conclude that removal to India would be likely to be
             seriously detrimental  to  the  third  Appellant's  wellbeing.
             There is now evidence to show that his parents would be unable
             to maintain him and his brother in  India  and  be  unable  to
             provide for their safety and welfare. I find, therefore,  that
             it would not be reasonable to expect him to leave  the  United
             Kingdom.  The  result  is  that  he  satisfies  the  terms  of
             paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules."

6.   In relation to Article 8 the judge directed himself in accordance  with
    Razgar and concluded:

         "34. I find that the first four questions fall to  be  answered  in
             the   affirmative.   The   remaining    question    concerning
             proportionality, which involves the same balancing exercise as
             that carried out above as  between  the  public  interest  and
             private rights.  Again I take account of  Section  117B(6)  of
             the 2002 Act (as  amended)  which  provides  that  the  public
             interest does not require a person's removal where he  or  she
             has a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
             'qualifying child' (in this case the third Appellant)  and  it
             would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom (as I have found).


         35.  The result is  that  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise
             falls in favour of the first  and  second  Appellants  as  the
             third Appellant's parents.


         36.  As the fourth Appellant is only 5ï¿½ years old  no  question  of
             separation from his parents  and  brother  arises  and  it  is
             clearly in his best interests to remain  in  the  family  unit
             with them.


         37.  I conclude therefore that the removal of the first, second and
             fourth   Appellants   would   involve    a    disproportionate
             interference with their Article 8 rights".

Submissions

7.   Miss Fijiwala relied on the grounds of appeal and  submitted  that  the
    judge failed to identify why he had distinguished this  case  from  the
    cases of EV (Philippines) and Zoumbas.  It was clear from paragraph  31
    of the decision that the main reason why it was  unreasonable  for  the
    third Appellant to leave the UK was that he was educated in the UK  and
    the cost of education in India was greater. This  analysis  was  flawed
    because the judge only  considered  factors  in  favour  of  the  third
    Appellant, not those against.

8.   Miss Fijiwala relied on paragraphs 59 to 61  of  EV  (Philippines)  and
    submitted that the judge had  failed  to  consider  that  none  of  the
    Appellants were citizens of the UK. The children were  reliant  on  the
    education system in the UK at public expense  and  this  was  a  factor
    which weighed against the Appellants in balancing the public  interest.
    The judge had failed to consider that both parents were overstayers  in
    considering whether it would be reasonable for the third  Appellant  to
    leave the UK.

9.   Miss Fijiwala accepted that the judge acknowledged  that  the  parents'
    case was hopeless but in any event he had failed to take  into  account
    their unlawful residence.  The starting point in the case  should  have
    been that the parents must be removed and it was for  the  children  to
    follow them. The judge had failed to adopt that approach.

10.  In relation to ground 2, Miss Fijiwala submitted  that  the  judge  had
    failed  to  give  weight  to  the  public  interest  in  assessing  the
    proportionality balance.  She relied on AM  (Malawi)  [2015]  UKUT  260
    (IAC) at paragraph 13 where the court held "the mere  presence  of  the
    children in the UK and their academic success  was  not  a  trump  card
    which their parents could deploy to demand immigration status  for  the
    whole family".  She submitted that was exactly what the judge had  done
    in this case and that was evident from his findings  at  paragraphs  17
    and 31.

11.  There was no objective evidence of the expensive schools  in  India  or
    of the fact that the Appellants' parents would not be  able  to  obtain
    employment.  She accepted that  this  matter  was  not  raised  in  the
    grounds of appeal. However, she went on to deal with  the  findings  at
    paragraph 31 and stated that the third  Appellant  was  in  a  position
    where he could have access to  education  because  he  was  capable  of
    learning to write in Gujarati or Hindi since he was able to  speak  the
    language.
    12.  Ms Fujiwala went on to rely on paragraph 39 of SS  (Congo)  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387 at paragraph 39(4) which stated:

         "The fact that the interests of a  child  are  in  issue  does  not
         simply provide a trump card so that a child applicant for  positive
         action to be taken by the state in the field of Article  8(1)  must
         always have their application acceded to."

    The judge's focus was in relation to the third Appellant and  therefore
    he had used the third Appellant as a trump card in this case.  Although
    the third Appellant was now eligible for British  citizenship,  it  was
    still a matter of whether it was reasonable for him to leave the UK and
    the judge did not properly conduct the assessment of this.

13.  In relation to the assessment of the public  interest,  the  judge  had
    failed to take into account the factors referred to in Section 117B  of
    the NIA Act 2002, namely that the parents could not speak  English  and
    had been working in the UK unlawfully. Therefore, they  had  failed  to
    show that they were financially independent as well.


Discussion and conclusions

14.  We did not  need  to  hear  from  Mr  Turner  before  arriving  at  the
    following conclusions. In relation to ground 1, the judge  applied  the
    cases of EV (Philippines) and Zoumbas at paragraphs 26 and  27  of  his
    determination and  quoted  from  both  of  those  decisions.   He  then
    concluded at paragraph 28:

         "For the third Appellant it was submitted that  the  assessment  is
         entirely fact-sensitive, which I accept,  and  that  the  facts  in
         those cases were clearly distinguishable  from  the  facts  in  the
         present case."

15.  Therefore, the judge had properly directed himself in  accordance  with
    EV (Philippines) and Zoumbas and he had given a reason for why  he  had
    not come to the same conclusion in those cases in that  he  found  that
    the assessment was  a  fact-sensitive  one  and  he  had  assessed  the
    particular facts of this case.

16.  We find that this is clear from the judge's reference at  paragraph  26
    to paragraph 44 of EV (Philippines).  In that case the court held:

         "In carrying out this assessment [the judge] took into account  the
         fact (a) that the parents would be employable in  the  Philippines;
         (b) that the family would not be homeless; (c) that  there  was  an
         extended family to which they  would  have  access;  (d)  that  the
         family had only been in the UK for a  limited  time  -  3  years  9
         months at the date of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  at  which
         time the children were 11, 10 and 8; (e) that  the  children  would
         not be without education in the Philippines. The fact that it would
         not be as good and that secondary education was not  free  was  not
         determinative.  In  addition  there  was   no   question   of   any
         interference with the appellants' family life...."

17.  It is clear from that paragraph that  the  facts  in  the  case  of  EV
    (Philippines) were entirely different to the facts in this  case.   The
    judge went on to consider those factors mentioned at paragraph 44 of EV
    (Philippines) in assessing whether it  was  reasonable  to  expect  the
    third Appellant to leave the UK.  He took into account the  ability  of
    the parents to obtain employment, their ability to obtain housing,  the
    presence of extended family members, their length of residence  in  the
    UK and whether the third Appellant could access  education.  The  Judge
    made the findings at paragraphs 29 to 32 of  the  decision,  which  are
    quoted above.

18.  The case of Zoumbas was also distinguished on its facts. In  that  case
    the parents were highly educated and the children were of an age  where
    their emotional needs could only be  fully  met  within  the  immediate
    family unit. The judge in that case concluded that the  children  could
    be removed in the care of their parents without  serious  detriment  to
    their well being.

19.  Therefore, we find that the judge applied the  principles  set  out  in
    the case law to the facts of the Appellants' case and his  findings  at
    paragraphs 29 to 32 were open to him on the evidence.  The  Appellants'
    situation was such that if returned to  India  it  would  cause  severe
    detriment to  the  third  Appellant  and  therefore  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect him to leave the UK.

20.  In relation to ground 2, the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the  public
    interest, we find that the judge has not used the third Appellant as  a
    trump card. Although he fully appreciated the third Appellant's pivotal
    position  in  the  appeal,  he  assessed  the  third  Appellant's  best
    interests  accordingly  and  then  he  put  that  assessment  into  the
    proportionality balancing exercise.

21.  The judge directed himself on the provisions of Section 117 of the  NIA
    Act 2002 at paragraphs 22 and 23:

         "22. The public interest in  maintaining  an  effective  system  of
             immigration control is clear and is entitled  to  considerable
             weight.  It is well established that the state has  the  right
             to control entry to its territory and that there is  no  right
             to choose where private and family life is to be established.


          23. ....one of the provisions of [Section  117B]  is  that  little
             weight is to be given to  a  private  life  formed  while  the
             person concerned is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  Another
             is that the public interest does not require the removal of  a
             person who has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a 'qualifying child' and it would not  be  reasonable  to
             expect that child to leave the United  Kingdom.  Section  117D
             defines 'qualifying child' as including a person under the age
             of 18 who has lived in the United  Kingdom  for  a  continuous
             period of seven years or more. The  third  Appellant  is  such
             child and again the question is whether it would be reasonable
             to expect him to leave the United Kingdom."

22.  Accordingly, the judge was well aware of the weight to be  attached  to
    the public interest as a result of the  first  and  second  Appellants'
    substantial period  of  unlawful  residence  in  the  UK.  He  properly
    directed himself under Section 117B(6)  and  his  conclusion  that  the
    proportionality balancing exercise fell in  favour  of  the  first  and
    second Appellants was open to him on the evidence.

23.  The judge's finding that it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    third Appellant to return to India was open to  him on the evidence and
    was not speculative as alleged in  the  grounds.  The  Appellants  were
    found to be credible witnesses and their evidence was unchallenged. The
    judge was  entitled  to  rely  on  their  evidence  in  coming  to  the
    conclusions he did at paragraphs 30 and  31.   The  judge  gave  cogent
    reasons for making those findings.

24.   We  find  that  the  judge  accepted  that  the  public  interest   in
    maintaining immigration control  required  the  removal  of  the  adult
    Appellants and that the best interests of the third Appellant was not a
    trump card in assessing proportionality. The judge worked  through  the
    circumstances of the case and the particular circumstances of the third
    Appellant.  We find that, on the particular facts  of  this  case,  the
    judge was entitled to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

25.  Accordingly we find that there was no material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the Respondents' appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal is dismissed. The decision  of  18th  March  2015  shall
    stand.
