                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE MOULDEN


                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                              MR KULWANT SINGH
                        (No Anonymity Direction Made)
                                                                 Respondents

    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Mr E Tufan a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
                            For the Respondents: Mr M Iqbal of
           counsel instructed by Denning solicitors

                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

   1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department  ("the
      Secretary of State"). The respondents are citizens of India born on  5
      June 1985 and 19 June 1986 respectively  ("the  claimants).  They  are
      husband-and-wife. The wife applied for further leave to remain in  the
      UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and the  husband  applied  as
      her dependant. The Secretary of State refused  their  applications  on
      the basis that they had overstayed.


   2. The claimants appealed and First-Tier Tribunal Judge Fox ("the  FTTJ")
      heard their appeals on 4 September 2013. He allowed  both  appeals  to
      the extent that  the  Secretary  of  State's  decisions  were  not  in
      accordance with the law and should be reconsidered by her.


   3. The Secretary of State applied  for  and  was  granted  permission  to
      appeal. At the hearing before me Mr Tufan said that the cases had been
      reconsidered and the Secretary of State wished to withdraw the appeals
      to the Upper  Tribunal.  She  would  reconsider  the  applications  as
      directed by the FTTJ. This is not a withdrawal of  the  whole  of  the
      Secretary of State's case as it is limited to the  withdrawal  of  the
      appeals to the Upper  Tribunal.  Nevertheless,  I  consider  that  the
      consent of the Upper Tribunal is  required  under  the  provisions  of
      Paragraph 17 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  I
      give that consent.


   4. I record that the Secretary of State has withdrawn her appeals to  the
      Upper Tribunal. The decision of the FTTJ stands. This notice should be
      given to the parties.
