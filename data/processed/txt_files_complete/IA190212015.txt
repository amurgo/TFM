Representation:
For the Respondent:    Ms C Simpson, counsel
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Coutts ("the FTTJ") promulgated  on  23  June  2016,  in
    which he allowed the appeal against the refusal to  issue  a  permanent
    residence  card  under  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations").


 2. For ease of  reference  and  continuity,  throughout  this  decision  I
    maintain the descriptions of the parties as appellant  and  respondent,
    as set out in the FTTJ's decision, although  it  is  the  Secretary  of
    State who pursues this appeal.

 3. No anonymity direction was made in the First-tier Tribunal  but,  given
    my references to the appellant's former spouse, who is not a  party  to
    these proceedings, an anonymity order is appropriate.

Background

 4. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who applied to the respondent for
    a residence card as confirmation of a right of  residence  in  the  UK.
    The  respondent  refused  the  application  because,  inter  alia,  the
    appellant had not provided a decree absolute as proof of  her  divorce.
    The decision was made  pursuant  to  Regulations  10(5),  15(1)(b)  and
    15(1)(f).  The appellant appealed that  decision  and  the  appeal  was
    allowed on the sole ground that the appellant  had  produced  a  decree
    absolute at the hearing.  The FTTJ found the appellant  was  "therefore
    entitled, pursuant to regulation  10(5)(a)  of  the  regulations  to  a
    permanent right of residence in the United Kingdom".


 5. Permission to  appeal  to  this  Tribunal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Astle on the grounds that it was arguable the Judge  had
    failed to engage fully with the requirements of Regulation 10(5)(a)  in
    that he had not made a finding that the former spouse was  a  qualified
    person at the date of divorce or that the "former spouse  had  acquired
    permanent residence by the date of divorce".  Hence  the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Hearing

 6. I indicated at the outset of the hearing that my preliminary  view  was
    that  the  FTTJ  had  not  made  sufficient  findings  under  the   EEA
    Regulations.  The parties' representatives were in agreement  that  the
    reasoning of the FTTJ was deficient.  I indicated  that  I  would  find
    there was a material error of law in the FTTJ's decision; he had failed
    to take into account the entirety of the reasons for refusal. Not  only
    was the appellant not divorced at the date of her application, and  her
    application had therefore been considered as an existing family  member
    of the sponsor, but the respondent identified various issues which were
    of relevance not only to the appellant as a family member but  also  to
    her status as a divorcee. The FTTJ had failed to engage with all  those
    reasons for refusal.  He appears to have inferred from the reasons  for
    refusal that the only issue was the lack of a decree absolute but  that
    was not the case, as is clear from the reasons for refusal  letter  and
    the notice of immigration  decision  itself  which  refers  to  various
    regulations.


 7. I was told by Ms Simpson that the appellant was  not  present  for  the
    hearing; she had been unwell but had been unable to provide  a  medical
    report. No adjournment was requested.  I therefore proceeded  with  the
    hearing. Ms Simpson submitted that the appeal should be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing, particularly given the absence
    of the appellant. Mr Clarke, for the respondent submitted that I should
    remake the decision,  there  being  adequate  evidence  in  the  bundle
    provided in the First-tier Tribunal.


 8. I indicated to the parties  that  I  would  remake  the  decision.  The
    appellant had been on notice that this may occur and no adjournment had
    been sought.   It was in the interests of justice  for  the  matter  to
    proceed, the parties being on notice that a  fresh  decision  might  be
    made in the Upper Tribunal.

 9. For the respondent, Mr Clarke submitted the evidence was not sufficient
    to demonstrate a right of permanent residence or that the appellant was
    (in effect) exercising Treaty  rights  at  the  date  of  divorce.  The
    evidence  pre-dated  the  decree  absolute.  The  difficulty  for   the
    appellant arose in complying with regulation 10(a) or (b). He submitted
    that the evidence  relating  to  the  former  spouse's  activities  was
    insufficient, stopping as it did six months before the hearing  in  the
    FTT. In any event,  unaudited  accounts  were  not  sufficient  on  the
    balance of probabilities; more was needed to demonstrate the activities
    behind the claimed income. He  noted  the  latest  self-assessment  tax
    return was issued in 2013. The unaudited accounts were not supported by
    tax returns. In any event, the appellant failed under Regulation  10(6)
    having failed to provide evidence of working at the date of hearing. Mr
    Clarke referred to the guidance in Amos v  SSHD  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  552
    suggesting that it was not necessary for the sponsor to have  had  five
    years prior to  the  date  of  annulment  provided  the  appellant  had
    continued the analogous period of worker  after  the  degree  absolute.
    There was, he said, no evidence  of  that  here,  only  three  payslips
    issued to the appellant. He summarised that  the  appellant  could  not
    meet the criteria in Regulations 10 and 15 for lack of evidence.

10. For the appellant, Ms Simpson relied on the  skeleton  argument  before
    the FTTJ. The parties had married in 2008 and divorced  on  27  October
    2015.  There was evidence of the parties living together  between  2009
    and 2012; they separated in 2013 and had therefore lived  together  for
    five years.  She submitted there was adequate evidence  of  the  former
    spouse paying tax until 2014, the  latest  filing  being  in  2015  and
    covering the tax year to  2014.  Thus  the  appellant's  ex-spouse  was
    exercising Treaty rights at that time. There  was  evidence  of  paying
    national  insurance  contributions.   It   was   accepted   there   was
    insufficient evidence to demonstrate the former spouse was in the UK at
    the date of the FTT hearing or that he was self-employed at that  time.
    This was not in the bundle.  There was some evidence  to  show  he  was
    here in 2015 albeit no tax return for the year  ending  2016.   It  was
    accepted there were only three payslips  for  the  appellant,  covering
    January - April 2016.  The appellant qualified under regulations 10 and
    15. The appellant did not pursue her appeal on Article 8 grounds.

Discussion

11. The parties were married in 2008 and the decree absolute was issued  on
    27 October 2015.  The latest tax return for the sponsor is for the  tax
    year ending 2013.  There are various unaudited accounts and the  latest
    of these is for the year ending 6 April 2014.  It is dated  31  January
    2016 but is unsigned by the appellant's former spouse. It merits little
    evidential weight therefore.  There are various documents  relating  to
    the payment of national insurance contributions but none of these post-
    date the tax documents.  There is  no  documentary  evidence  that  the
    appellant's former spouse was either in the  UK  or  exercising  treaty
    rights at the date of divorce: 27 October 2015.


12. I take into account the appellant's witness  statement  to  the  effect
    that her former spouse was not willing to provide her with  his  "self-
    employment" documents, only his tax  returns  and  accounts.   However,
    even the latter, which he was willing to provide, do not extend to  the
    date of divorce or cover a five year period. The  tax  return  for  the
    year to April 2009 refers to turnover of only  ï¿½6,901  which  does  not
    suggest an income from the business for the full tax year.

13. I am unable to find that the appellant's  spouse  has  been  exercising
    Treaty rights in the UK for a five year period.  Nor am I able to find,
    on the basis of only three payslips, that  the  appellant  herself  has
    been a worker in the UK for a period longer  than  January-April  2016.
    It follows that the appellant has not demonstrated that she had a right
    of residence under the Regulations, prior to  her  divorce  in  October
    2015, as the spouse of a qualified person (Amos refers).  She  has  not
    demonstrated she has  retained  a  right  of  residence  (Ahmed  (Amos;
    Zambrano; reg 15A(3)(c) 2006 EEA  Regs)  [2013]  UKUT  89  (IAC)  which
    followed Amos).


14. For these reasons, I set aside the decision of the FTTJ and  remake  it
    dismissing the appeal.

Decision

15. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
    material errors of law, as set out above.


16. I set aside the decision.

17. I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing  it  under  the  EEA
    Regulations.
