                                    Judicial    Review    Decision    Notice



                     In the matter of an application for judicial review

                               Nighat Sultana
                                                                Applicant

                                      V




                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                     Respondent





              Decision of The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey,
                      President of the Upper Tribunal:
               the application for judicial review is refused.




       Having  considered  all  documents  lodged,  and  having  heard  the
       parties'  respective  representatives,  Mr   Sarwar,   of   Counsel,
       instructed on behalf of the  Applicant  and  Mr  Serr,  of  Counsel,
       instructed by the Treasury Solicitor, on behalf of  the  Respondent,
       at a hearing at Manchester Civil Justice Centre on 08 April 2015.


         1. In the great majority of cases where the court decides that the
            impugned  decision  is  contaminated   by   some   public   law
            misdemeanour, the remedy granted is a  quashing  order  whereby
            the respondent is obliged to make a fresh decision, taking into
            account the judgment of the court.


         2. The remedy of a mandatory  order  is  rarely  granted.   It  is
            appropriate only in cases where it is clear to the  court  that
            the respondent is legally obliged to take a certain  course  of
            action, normally involving the conferral  of  some  benefit  or
            advantage  on  the  challenging  party,  with  no   choice   or
            discretion.  The course that the respondent is ordered  by  the
            court to take in a mandatory order must  be  "the  sole  result
            that is legally permissible".








                       Approved Ex Tempore Judgment


       [1]  The Applicant in this matter is a  national  of  Pakistan  who,
           together with her three children, the oldest of whom is aged  14
           years  together   with   twins   aged   four   years,   applied,
           unsuccessfully, for entry clearance to enter the United  Kingdom
           under the Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  regime  of  the  Points  Based
           System enshrined in the Immigration Rules.  The application  was
           refused by the Respondent's Entry Clearance Officer  ("ECO")  on
           the sole ground that the Applicant qualified  for  an  award  of
           zero  points  in  respect  of  the  "maintenance"   requirement.
           Whereas she was awarded full points for the  other  requirements
           in respect whereof points are  awardable,  the  decision  letter
           included the following passage:


                 "As  claimed,  however,  your  application  has  not   been
                 considered under subparagraphs (f)  and  (i)  of  paragraph
                 245DB as you have not met all of the other requirements  of
                 paragraph 245DB of the Immigration Rules."


            I shall revisit the significance of this statement presently.




       [2]  It was not in dispute that, as rehearsed  in  the  Respondent's
           decision, it was incumbent upon the Applicant under the Rules to
           demonstrate access to total funds of �8,500 during a consecutive
           90 day period, as specified.  Nor was there  any  dispute  about
           the accuracy of the  Respondent's  calculation  that  the  funds
           demonstrated in the Pakistani bank statement submitted with  the
           application evidenced a balance of �8,037.  The issue which  was
           in  dispute  between  the  parties  concerned  the  Respondent's
           failure to take into account  the  evidence  of  a  Post  Office
           account also submitted  with  the  application.   This  was  the
           stimulus for a request for administrative review  by  the  Entry
           Clearance Manager.  This,  in  turn,  resulted  in  the  initial
           decision being affirmed, for the following reason, in summary:


                 "This evidence is very ambiguous and for the reasons  cited
                 above I am not satisfied can be relied upon."


           In the immediately preceding passage the decision maker outlined
           certain asserted obscurities and ambiguities in the Post  Office
           account statement in question.


       [3]  Sequentially, the application  for  judicial  review  was  then
           initiated, no pre-action protocol letter  having  been  written.
           This stimulated an admirably prompt response on  behalf  of  the
           Respondent by the Treasury Solicitor who,  by  letter  dated  11
           April 2014, signified the following:


                 "I am instructed that my client will  agree  to  reconsider
                 your  application  for  entry  clearance,  subject  to  you
                 agreeing  to  be  reinterviewed  in  connection  with  that
                 application."


            This letter attached a draft consent order  the  terms  whereof
           were that in consideration of the  judicial  review  application
           being withdrawn and each party bearing their  respective  costs,
           the   Respondent   would   reconsider   the   entry    clearance
           applications.  On the issue of costs,  the  accompanying  letter
           highlighted the failure to comply with the pre-action  protocol.
           Permission to apply for judicial review was then granted on  the
           papers.


       [4]   Regrettably,  one  year  has  elapsed   since   the   Treasury
           Solicitor's letter was written. Ultimately, this case was listed
           for  substantive  hearing  on  08  April  2015.   Three   issues
           continued  to  separate  the  parties.   First,  the   Applicant
           contended that, in light of the concession signalled  on  behalf
           of the Respondent at an early stage, she  was  entitled  to  the
           remedy of a mandatory order (formerly  mandamus).   Second,  the
           Applicant contended that she should  not  have  to  undergo  any
           further interview by the ECO..  Third, the Applicant asserted an
           entitlement to costs.


       [5]  I conclude that this application must fail, for  the  following
           reasons, in summary:


              a) There is no demonstrable  illegality  in  the  Respondent's
                 wish to interview the Applicant  further,  if  so  desired.
                 This does not infringe any known legal rule.  Nor can it be
                 condemned as irrational in the Wednesbury sense.


              b) The remedy of a mandatory order  is  rarely  granted.   The
                 reason for this is that this remedy is appropriate only  in
                 cases where it is clear to the court that the Respondent is
                 legally  obliged  to  take  a  certain  course  of  action,
                 normally  involving  the  conferral  of  some  benefit   or
                 advantage on the  challenging  party,  with  no  choice  or
                 discretion.  In the great majority of cases where the court
                 decides that the impugned decision is contaminated by  some
                 public law misdemeanour, the remedy granted is  a  quashing
                 order whereby the Respondent is obliged  to  make  a  fresh
                 decision, taking into account the  education  and  guidance
                 provided by the judgment of the  court.   Where  the  court
                 finds that the impugned decision  cannot  be  sustained  in
                 law, a mandatory  order  is  the  appropriate  remedy  only
                 rarely.   See,  for  example,  the  decision  in  R  (O)  v
                 Hammersmith LBC [2011] EWCA  Civ  925,  together  with  the
                 instructive formulation that "... there was only one way in
                 which the Secretary of State could reasonably exercise  his
                 discretion ..." in R (S) v SSHD  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  546  at
                 [46].  It  must  be  "the  sole  result  that  is   legally
                 permissible": Supperstone & Goudie, Judicial Review  (Fifth
                 Edition), paragraph 16.6.2

              c) The Applicant's contention that the  Respondent  should  be
                 ordered to grant the entry clearance applications is, in my
                 view, confounded by one of the  cornerstone  principles  of
                 public law, namely the inalienable duty imposed upon  every
                 public authority to make its decision taking  into  account
                 all  material  facts  and  considerations.   This,  in   my
                 estimation, entails  a  current  assessment  based  on  the
                 present evidence.  There is no  scope  for  any  assumption
                 that information which  is  now  of  some  vintage  remains
                 unchanged and, indeed, no evidence was laid to this effect.
                  To grant the mandatory order sought would, in my  opinion,
                 run contrary  to  this  fundamental  principle,  for  which
                 citation of authority is otiose.

              d) This assessment is reinforced by the consideration that the
                 benefit sought by the  Applicant  and  her  three  children
                 involves  the  formation  of   a   series   of   evaluative
                 assessments, or judgments, on the part of  the  Respondent.
                 To qualify for the grant of entry clearance under paragraph
                 245DB of the Rules does not involve a tick  box  assessment
                 with bright luminous lines.

              e) Finally, as I have highlighted above,  the  Respondent  has
                 not yet carried out any assessment of the series of factors
                 and requirements contained in subparagraphs (f) and (i)  of
                 paragraph 245DB.  These sound mostly on the important issue
                 of genuine plans and intentions on the part of the  Tier  1
                 applicant. The rule states  unequivocally  that  the  Entry
                 Clearance Officer "must" be satisfied  of  the  matters  in
                 question.


      [6]   For the reasons elaborated above, I conclude that the  grant  of
           the mandatory order sought by the  Applicant  is  inappropriate.
           No other remedy was actively pursued, having regard to the terms
           of the Respondent's concession.  The judicial review application
           must be dismissed accordingly.


           Costs

      [7]   The dull and slavish application of the general rule that  costs
           follow the event would entitle the Respondent to an order in its
           favour.  However,  exercising  my  discretion,  I  have  decided
           against this course, taking into account the following  factors.
           Firstly, it seems highly likely that if the  error  conceded  on
           behalf of the Respondent had been avoided initially,  the  entry
           clearance applications would have succeeded.  Secondly,  at  the
           time when the failure to compile a  pre-action  protocol  letter
           occurred, it appears that the Applicant did not have the benefit
           of  legal  representation.   Thirdly,  this   failure   had   no
           consequence of any import,  given  the  Respondent's  subsequent
           stance.  Fourthly,  the  Respondent's   insistence,   maintained
           throughout the greater  part  of  these  proceedings,  that  the
           Applicant must undergo a further interview by the ECO, come what
           may, was, in my view, misconceived.  There is no legal  rule  of
           which I am aware imposing such a requirement in mandatory terms.
            Rather, the Respondent has a discretion which must be exercised
           in accordance with  established  public  law  principles.   This
           misplaced insistence was not withdrawn until a very late  stage:
           significantly, it was withdrawn.  If one had stopped  the  clock
           at that point, on the hypothesis of  the  duly  revised  consent
           order being executed, I consider that  if  adjudication  of  the
           issue of costs had been required the Applicant would  have  been
           granted all or most of her costs.   Viewing  everything  in  the
           round, I conclude that it is fair and  appropriate  to  make  no
           order as to costs inter partes.

            Permission to Appeal

      [8]   I consider it inappropriate to grant permission to appeal  since
           the determination of this application for  judicial  review  has
           entailed the application  of  well  settled  principles  to  its
           particular matrix and does not give rise to any point of law  of
           broader significance.


      Order

      [9]   In the result:

              a) The application for judicial review is dismissed.


              b) There is no order as to costs inter partes.

              c) Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal is refused.
