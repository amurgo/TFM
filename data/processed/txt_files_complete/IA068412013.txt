Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Rehman, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, born on 11  March  1977.   He
    appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Martins  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  the
    respondent on 14 February 2013 to vary his leave to remain in the UK as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.  The respondent's refusal was  made
    under paragraph 245ZX(ha) of the Immigration Rules.

2.   The refusal letter  stated  that  the  appellant  had  previously  been
    granted leave to study a Postgraduate  Diploma  in  Management  Systems
    from February 2005 to February 2006, MSc in Information Systems from 14
    February 2006 to 29 February 2008, MBA from October 2006 to July  2009,
    and MSc in Executive Leadership from 31 October 2011 to 3 October 2012.
     His current application is to study Diploma in Strategic Direction and
    Leadership from 14 November 2012 to 31 October 2014.  A grant of  leave
    to study this course would lead to the appellant having spent more than
    five years in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant,  or  as  a  student
    studying courses at degree level or above.  The appellant did not  come
    within any of the exceptions as his course was not one of  the  courses
    listed in the Immigration Rules.

3.   The judge heard evidence from the appellant.  He confirmed that he  was
    granted leave to remain in the UK on 10  December  2003  as  a  student
    until 31 January 2005.     The judge  recorded  at  paragraph  9(i)  to
    (vii) the courses the appellant said he has studied in the  UK.    They
    are:

         (i)  Level 4 Diploma from London City Institute

         (ii) Level 4 Diploma from (Jupitar)  Information  Technology  from
         February 2005 to February 2006.

         (iii) Level 3 certificate from Horizon College from February  2006
         to September 2006.

         (iv) Masters degree from London South Bank University from October
         2006 to July 2008.  From July to December 2008  the  appellant  was
         awaiting  a  decision/result  of   his   dissertation,   which   he
         unfortunately failed in February 2008 and was asked to  repeat  his
         dissertation.  From February 2009 to 14 June 2009 he restarted  his
         studies and re-submitted the dissertation.  He was finally  awarded
         the qualification in September 2009.

         (v) From 31 October 2009, the appellant applied for  a  post-study
         work visa and was granted such a visa until 31 October 2011.

         (vi) From 31 October 2011 to June 2011 [sic 2012] he studied on  a
         Masters degree from University of Ulster and was awarded  a  degree
         in October 2012, namely Masters of Science Certificate

         (vii) In November 2012 the appellant enrolled on a Level 8 Diploma
         in  Strategic  Direction  and  Leadership  from  BITE  College  and
         attaches a copy of a letter from BITE.

4.   In respect of the current course of  study,  the  appellant  said  that
    formal organised study would be completed in  December  2013,  although
    the course would formally end in October 2014, as after  December  2013
    he is expected to work on his thesis.  He said that this course  is  at
    doctoral level and is research based.

5.   The appellant  said  that  he  had  obtained  a  Bachelor's  degree  in
    Management in Pakistan.  He produced  a  letter  from  Horizon  College
    indicating that because of difficulties experienced by the college, the
    course in Information System was changed  from  MSc  to  a  certificate
    qualification.  He said that the  Level  4  Diploma  from  London  City
    Institute was not a postgraduate qualification.

6.   The judge found as follows:

         "28. I had the opportunity of hearing and observing  the  appellant
             give evidence and had no reason to disbelieve his  account  of
             the courses in which  he  had  been  involved  in  the  United
             Kingdom.  However, this appeal turns  purely  on  whether  the
             appellant has undertaken studies at a degree level  or  above,
             for more than the maximum of five years, permitted  under  the
             rules.  Mr Rehman on behalf of the appellant sought  to  argue
             that as the appellant had been a post  study  worker  from  31
             October 2009 to 31 October 2011, the Home Office had  made  an
             error in calculating the five years, as there had been a break
             in his studies.  Mr Rehman  submitted  that,  carried  to  its
             logical conclusion, the decision would mean that no one  could
             return to the United Kingdom for further study, having studied
             at degree level or above for five years.   It  was  sought  to
             argue that given the break in studies by the post  study  work
             visa, the appellant had not studied at degree level  or  above
             for five years.
         29.  I find that this would be importing  the  word  "continuously"
             into the Immigration Rule.  It is clear from  the  appellant's
             evidence, that before his current PhD  equivalent  course,  he
             has studied at graduate level or above, for  some  five  years
             between February 2005 and October 2012.  His current  studies,
             involves him in a further two years' study.  I find  therefore
             that the appellant has studied at graduate level or above  for
             five years and that his  current  studies  will  lead  to  him
             exceeding that period.  The decision of the Secretary of State
             is therefore  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  Immigration
             Rules."

7.    Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    Robertson who said as follows:

         "2.  It is arguable that the Judge, having stated that she accepted
             the Appellant's evidence as to the courses he  had  undertaken
             (paragraphs 16, 28 and 29), then made findings of fact  as  to
             the number of years that he was engaged in study at  or  above
             degree level that were inconsistent with his evidence.  It  is
             unclear from the determination which courses she  accepted  as
             being  at  degree  level  or  the  periods  during  which  the
             Appellant was engaged in degree level study.


         3.   There is less arguable merit in the  other  grounds:  although
             the Judge has not made findings of fact  in  relation  to  the
             removal decision, this was not raised  in  submissions  before
             her, which focussed  entirely  on  the  substantive  decision.
             There is nothing with the provisions  of  paragraph  245ZX(ha)
             that excludes from the assessment of the five years period the
             studies undertaken by a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  when
             he was a student under the previous paragraph  57  provisions.
             The provisions of paragraph 245ZX(ha) are clear  that  periods
             of leave to study as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant, or as
             a student, are to be included, and the definition  of  Student
             in the Immigration Rules does  not  affect  these  provisions.
             The logical outcome of the interpretation argued on behalf  of
             the Appellant is that the current provisions will  only  apply
             if the Appellant has completed five years of degree  or  above
             degree level study either as a Tier 4 Student or as a student,
             which cannot be right as it would frustrate the clear  aim  of
             the Rules.  As to the Article 8 assessment, it  was  conducted
             in accordance with Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 principles, the Judge
             having accepted that Article 8 is engaged on the basis of  the
             Appellant's private life; there is no need for  the  Judge  to
             cite case law.  She considered the Appellant's  evidence  with
             regard to  private  life  and  the  proportionality  exercise,
             albeit brief, appears to be adequate bearing in mind that  the
             Appellant was not engaged in  a  course  of  study.   However,
             pursuant to Ferrer (limited appeal grounds; Alvi) [2012]  UKUT
             00304 (IAC) all grounds are arguable."

SUBMISSIONS

8.   Mr Rehman identified the courses that the appellant had  undertaken  at
    degree level or above by referring me to paragraph 9(iv) of the judge's
    decision where it is recorded that the  appellant  studied  a  Master's
    degree from London Southbank University from October 2006 to July 2008.
     He also relied on subparagraph (vi) where it is recorded that from  31
    October 2011 to  June  2012  he  studied  on  a  Master's  degree  from
    University of Ulster and was awarded a degree in October 2012, namely a
    Masters of Science certificate.  Mr  Rehman  said  that  the  appellant
    studied these courses over a period of three years.  The  appellant  is
    currently undertaking a course in Strategic  Direction  and  Leadership
    which is at doctoral level for a period of two years.  This means  that
    if permission is granted to the appellant to undertake this course  his
    period of study at degree level and above would be up to five years.

9.   Mr Rehman said that we have to disregard the period from December  2008
    to February 2009 when the appellant was waiting  for  his  results.  We
    also have to disregard the period from February 2009 to June 2009  when
    he repeated the course and was awarded his degree in September 2009.

10.  Mr Rehman maintained the argument that there are two different sets  of
    student  categories:  the  student  under  paragraph  57  of  the   old
    Immigration Rules and a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.  He said that
    each student category comes with different  conditions.   Consequently,
    the appellant has either  to  satisfy  245ZX(ha)  as  a  student  under
    paragraph 57 or as Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

11.  With regard to Article 8 he said that the appellant has been in the  UK
    since December 2003 and has established friendships and connections  in
    the UK.  Most importantly, he is in the middle of his course and it  is
    a course that is not available in Pakistan.

12.  Mr Rehman, who had initially said that the appellant has  been  in  the
    UK for almost  ten  years  then  argued  that  the  appellant  has  now
    completed ten years in the UK and therefore meets paragraph 276 of  the
    Immigration Rules.  This is a new issue that arises after the  date  of
    decision and complies with Section 85(4) of the 2002 Immigration Act.

13.  Ms Pal said that the appellant arrived in the UK on  10  December  2003
    and has not been in the UK for  ten  years,  and  therefore  the  final
    argument by Mr Rehman does not assist the  appellant.   In  any  event,
    according to Mansoor Ali [2013] EWCA Civ 1198 it is not permissible  to
    regard a fresh ground of appeal as an application.  Mr Rehman then said
    that the appellant has twenty days remaining before he is  entitled  to
    get the benefit of the ten year indefinite leave rule  under  paragraph
    276.  He submitted that paragraph 54  of  Patel  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  741
    distinguishes Mansoor Ali.

14.  Ms Pal submitted that if the appellant  is  granted  further  leave  to
    remain it would take him over the five  year  period  stipulated  under
    paragraph 245ZX(ha).

FINDINGS

15.  I find that although  the  judge  did  not  identify  the  courses  she
    accepted as being at degree level, or  the  periods  during  which  the
    appellant was engaged in degree  level  study,  the  decision  was  not
    tainted by error of law.  I give my reasons below.

16.  It is appropriate to set out paragraph 245ZX(ha).  It states:

         "If the course is at degree level or above, the grant of  leave  to
         remain the applicant is seeking must  not  lead  to  the  applicant
         having spent more than 5 years in the UK  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
         Migrant, or as a Student, studying courses at degree level or above
         unless:"


    It then goes on to give the exceptions which,  as  already  noted,  the
    appellant does not satisfy.


17.  The respondent identified the  courses  for  which  the  appellant  was
    previously  granted  leave  to  study  (1)  Postgraduate   Diploma   in
    Management Studies from February 2005 to  February  2006;  (2)  MSc  in
    Information Systems from 14 February 2006 to 29 February 2008; (3)  MBA
    from October 2008 to July 2009; (4) MSc in Executive Leadership from 31
    October 2011 to 3 October 2012.  In light of this evidence I find  that
    from 2005 until October 2012 the appellant had studied for  five  years
    on courses at degree level and above.   Therefore,  the  respondent  is
    right to say that if he is granted permission to remain to complete his
    current course of study that would  certainly  lead  to  the  appellant
    having spent more than five years in the  UK  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Migrant or as a student studying courses at degree level or above.

18.  I find that Mr. Rehman's  arguments  only  focus  on  the  courses  the
    appellant claimed in his oral evidence that he  studied.  I  find  that
    some of the courses bear no relationship to the courses  for  which  he
    was granted leave to study.  For instance, he had been granted leave to
    study for a Postgraduate Diploma in Management  studies  from  February
    2005 to February 2006 but instead  he  studied  level  4  Diploma  from
    "Jupiter" Information Technology from February 2005 to  February  2006.
    According to the respondent the appellant was  granted  leave  from  14
    February 2006 to 29 February 2008 to study for an  MSc  in  Information
    Systems but from what he told the  judge  he  studied  for  a  level  3
    Certificate from Horizon College from February 2006 to  September  2006
    before undertaking a Master's degree from London  Southbank  University
    from October 2006 to July 2008.

19.  I find that paragraph 245ZX(ha) is based on the  period  of  leave  the
    appellant is granted to study at degree level and not on  the  duration
    of the courses he considers he has studied at degree level.

20.  I do not agree with Mr Rehman's argument that there was  a  distinction
    between a Tier 4 (General) Student and a student because each  category
    came with different conditions.  Paragraph 245ZX was inserted into  the
    Immigration Rules on 31 March 2009 and subparagraph (ha)  was  inserted
    from 6 April 2012. I do not find that the Immigration  Rules  make  any
    distinction between courses studied as a student and courses studied as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student. I agree  with  First-tier  Judge  Robertson
    that there is nothing in the provisions  of  paragraph  245ZX(ha)  that
    excludes from the assessment  of  the  five  year  period  the  studies
    undertaken by a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant when he was a  student
    under the previous paragraph 57 provisions.  This has been confirmed in
    a reported decision by the Upper Tribunal - Islam (Para 245ZX(ha): five
    years' study) 2013 UKUT 00608(IAC).

21.  I find on the evidence before me that the appellant  does  not  satisfy
    the requirements in paragraph 245ZX(ha).

22.  I also find that as the appellant has  not  been  in  the  UK  for  ten
    years, he cannot qualify for leave to remain under  paragraph  276B  of
    the Immigration Rules and therefore Mr. Rehman's argument on this issue
    is not worthy of consideration.  In any event I rely Mansoor Ali [2013]
    EWCA Civ 1198 in which  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  it  is  not
    permissible to regard a fresh ground of appeal as an application.

23.  In respect of the appellant's appeal under Article 8 of the  ECHR,  the
    judge accepted that the appellant had been here  for  over  nine  years
    studying and therefore has established a private  life  which  will  be
    interfered with if he returns to Pakistan.  She found however that  the
    interference was in  pursuance  of  the  legitimate  aim  of  effective
    immigration control.  She considered the appellant's claim that  if  he
    had to leave the UK in the middle of his current  studies,  his  career
    plans would be significantly impacted.   She  however  found  that  the
    appellant has achieved much by way of qualification in the UK and  that
    the interference that would ensue in his  private  life  would  not  be
    disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  I see no error of  law
    in the judge's findings.

24.  I find that the judge did not  make  an  error  of  law.   The  judge's
    decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
