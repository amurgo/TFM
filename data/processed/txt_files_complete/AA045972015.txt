Representation:
Appellant   Miss Johnstone (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran. On September 16, 2013 the appellant
    left Iran and travelled through a number of  unknown  countries  before
    arriving in the United Kingdom in a  lorry  on  October  12,  2013.  He
    claimed asylum the following day and was served with form IS151A by the
    respondent the same day.

 2. The respondent refused his  application  on  February  27,  2015  under
    paragraph 336 HC 395 and the same day a decision was made to remove him
    as an illegal entrant by way of directions  under  paragraphs  8-10  of
    schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971.

 3. The appellant appealed that decision on March 18,  2015  under  section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4. The matter came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Pacey  on  June
    3, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on June  17,  2015  the  Tribunal
    upheld the refusal and dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  for  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and under ECHR.

 5. The appellant applied  for  permission  to  appeal  on  June  29,  2015
    submitting the Tribunal had erred. Permission to appeal was granted  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shimmin on July 7, 2015 who  found  it
    arguable firstly, the Tribunal had erred in its assessment of the  risk
    the appellant faced and secondly, the Tribunal had  failed  to  make  a
    finding as to whether the appellant had left Iran illegally and whether
    he would face a real risk  of  persecution,  regardless  of  any  other
    findings.

 6. A Rule 24 response was filed by the respondent  on  July  17,  2015  in
    which the respondent opposed the appeal.

 7. The appellant was in attendance before me and was  represented  as  set
    out above.

 8. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to make an order now.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 9. Miss Johnstone argued that the Tribunal made a clear finding  that  the
    appellant committed adultery  outside  of  his  own  marriage  and  the
    Tribunal should have considered whether the appellant would be at  risk
    on return because of that adultery. She referred to paragraphs [10]  to
    [12] of the decision where the Tribunal appeared to have  accepted  the
    appellant had committed adultery.  Regardless of the  adverse  findings
    made the Tribunal should have assessed the risk facing the appellant on
    the basis of its own findings. The Tribunal's  decision  was  confusing
    and contained inconsistencies and these undermined the whole  decision.
    The Tribunal further erred in  suggesting  corroborative  evidence  was
    required  in  circumstances  where  such  evidence   was   not   easily
    obtainable. The Tribunal referred in paragraphs [15] to [17]  that  the
    appellant's uncle and cousin could have  provided  statements  but  had
    erred in suggesting the evidence was easily obtainable.  On  the  issue
    of illegal exit the Tribunal failed to make a clear finding on  whether
    the appellant had left illegally and  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    evidence that had been submitted. The  Tribunal  should  have  departed
    from the country guidance case of SB (Iran) CG [2009] UKAIT  00053  and
    should have considered the prison conditions that the  appellant  would
    face upon return.

10.  Mr  McVeety  submitted  there  was  no  material  error.  Reading  the
    Tribunal's decision as a whole he argued the Tribunal had rejected  the
    appellant's account. Miss Johnson was "cherry  picking"  lines  in  the
    decision but the decision had to be read as a whole. The Tribunal spent
    five paragraphs considering the appellant's case and gave  reasons  why
    his claim lacked credibility. The Tribunal made clear that  aspects  of
    the appellant's case were unbelievable and it was wrong to suggest  the
    Tribunal had accepted the appellant's account as credible. The Tribunal
    had correctly considered the issue of corroboration and concluded  that
    letters from the appellant's uncle and cousin could have been  provided
    easily and the Tribunal was therefore entitled  to  take  this  failure
    into account.  The Tribunal had considered risk on return and  rejected
    his claim he had  left  illegally.  The  Tribunal  had  considered  the
    objective evidence but concluded that there was  no  reason  to  depart
    from the case law of SB.

11. Miss Johnstone responded to these submissions and submitted that  there
    was no positive finding on credibility and that the  Tribunal  had  not
    rejected the appellant's claim to have been involved in  an  adulterous
    relationship.  The  Tribunal's  criticisms  about  his  behaviour  were
    cursory at best and she submitted there were no firm negative  findings
    against him. She argued the core reason for the appellant leaving  Iran
    had been accepted by the Tribunal and she submitted that  the  Tribunal
    had found the appellant's  case  credible  in  paragraph  [20]  of  its
    decision.

    CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS

12. The first challenge to the Tribunal's decision concerned the Tribunal's
    approach to the appellant's claimed relationship with  Maryam  and  the
    fact that he said he was married.

13. Miss Johnstone submitted that the Tribunal accepted in  paragraph  [10]
    of its decision that the appellant had himself committed  adultery.  Mr
    McVeety submitted that this approach was naï¿½ve and failed to take  into
    account the Tribunal's findings about the alleged relationship and  his
    marriage.

14. In considering whether an error has been made it is  important  not  to
    take sentences out of context but to have regard to the whole decision.
     The Tribunal's decision that did not contain any headings and included
    factual matters alongside findings.

15. The appellant's account is contained in paragraphs [4]  to  [6],  [13],
    [14], [16] to [19] of the decision.  In those paragraphs  the  Tribunal
    set out the appellant's claim. I am asked to make a  finding  that  the
    Tribunal accepted the appellant committed adultery on the basis of  sex
    outside his own marriage but I have satisfied  that  the  reference  in
    paragraph [10]  of  it  s  decision  was  merely  a  statement  of  the
    appellant's case and not a finding of fact.

16. The Tribunal made its position clear in paragraphs [20] and  [22]  when
    it stated the appellant was not credible and it found  the  core  claim
    lacked credibility.

17. The Tribunal rejected the appellant's claim that he had a  relationship
    with Maryam and gave numerous reasons. The Tribunal  explained  why  it
    doubted the account was credible these can be found in  paragraphs  [8]
    to [21].

18. The suggestion the Tribunal found his account  credible  has  no  merit
    whatsoever.  Whilst the Tribunal's decision could have been written  in
    an easier format I am left in no doubt how the  Tribunal  assessed  the
    appellant's claim. The Tribunal gave detailed reasons that were open to
    it and in those circumstances I find  no  merit  to  the  first  ground
    argued that the Tribunal had erred by failing to consider a risk  based
    on the fact he had allegedly committed adultery.

19. Miss Johnstone argued the Tribunal  had  applied  the  wrong  test  for
    corroboration. The Tribunal reminded itself that corroboration was  not
    required in an asylum case but an absence of  evidence  that  could  be
    obtained easily was a factor the Tribunal could take into account  when
    assessing credibility.

20. Miss Johnson submitted that  it  would  not  have  been  easy  for  the
    appellant's uncle or cousin to send him statements but the Tribunal did
    not accept this  submission  and  nothing  argued  today  suggests  the
    Tribunal was wrong in its approach.

21. The second ground argued related to risk on  return  but  the  Tribunal
    made it clear  in  paragraph  [22]  of  its  decision  that  the  judge
    concluded that as the  core  of  his  account  lacked  credibility  the
    Tribunal rejected his claim to have left illegally.

22. The argument put forward is that the country guidance case  of  SB  has
    been superseded by further  evidence.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  spent
    considerable time considering that evidence. At paragraph [29]  of  its
    decision the Tribunal found that as his core account was rejected there
    was no risk of him facing court proceedings if  he  were  returned.  If
    there was no risk of court proceedings then the Tribunal did  not  need
    to consider prison conditions as there was no risk the appellant  would
    face such conditions.

23. In summary, I am not persuaded either of Ms Johnstone's submission have
    any merit. The Tribunal found  the  appellant  lacked  credibility  and
    rejected his claim and gave reasons for that decision.  Those  findings
    were relevant to the assessment of illegal exit and risk on return. The
    Tribunal  then  considered  other  evidence  submitted  but  found  the
    principles of SB still applied and dismissed the appellant's appeal.

24. I am satisfied those findings were open to the Tribunal and accordingly
    I dismiss this appeal.
