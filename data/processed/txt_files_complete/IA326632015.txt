                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Lagunju promulgated on 23  November  2016  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    appeal against a decision of  the  Respondent  dated  7  November  2014
    refusing him leave to remain and making a removal decision pursuant  to
    section 47 of Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, The  appeal
    before the First-tier Tribunal was decided without a hearing.


2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nepal born on 22 September 1987.   On  30
    May 2014 he made an application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student  migrant.   On  9  October  2014  the  Appellant  was
    interviewed in connection  with  his  application.   A  record  of  the
    interview is to be found at Annex E of the Respondent's  bundle  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.
3.   In the course of the  interview  the  Appellant  was  asked  about  his
    financial circumstances and indicated, amongst other things,  that  his
    parents had paid �3,500 for his current course and  that  he  was  also
    sent �100 - �200 every month by his father.  The Appellant was asked if
    he had undertaken any paid work in the UK since his last grant of leave
    to which he answered 'yes'.  He was then asked about the nature of this
    work: the full extent of the reply recorded is in these terms,  "I  was
    in charge of my relative's pub in Reading.  I did it for one month.  He
    paid me  in  national  insurance".  The  interviewing  officer  in  the
    concluding parts of the interview pro forma was required to indicate an
    opinion as to whether the Appellant had  been  credible  at  interview:
    the interviewing officer records 'no' by  way  of  answer.  Immediately
    beneath  is  a  heading  'Recommendation  summary'.   The  interviewing
    officer wrote this:

         "Although he does appear to be  a  genuine  student  it  is  highly
         probable that he is working more than he has claimed since it would
         not be possible  to  live  on  only  �100-�200  per  month  and  an
         inexperienced person would be unlikely to be able to manage  a  pub
         for a full month."


4.   It is to be noted in the latter context  that  there  was  no  apparent
    attempt at the interview to explore in any detail  with  the  Appellant
    what 'being in charge' of his  relative's  pub  had  involved  and  the
    extent to which he had had any assistance from other members of  staff.
    As  regards  the  Appellant's  financial  circumstances  there  was  no
    exploration of his living costs.


5.   The Respondent then made a decision on the Appellant's application  and
    refused it for reasons set out in  a  combined  'reasons  for  refusal'
    letter and notice of immigration decision dated 7 November  2014  ('the
    RFRL').       The Appellant was awarded the requisite points in respect
    of the Tier 4 points-based system with regard to both 'Attributes'  (by
    reference to a valid Confirmation of Acceptance for  Studies),  and  in
    respect of 'Maintenance (Funds)'.  However, his application was refused
    with reference in particular to paragraph 245ZX(o) of  the  Immigration
    Rules.



6.   The Respondent noted the following features of the case  in  the  RFRL.
    The Appellant had admitted at interview to having worked,  and  it  was
    noted how much regular income the Appellant had indicated at interview.
     It was also noted that the Appellant's last grant  of  leave  did  not
    allow him to work in the United Kingdom. It was observed  that  if  the
    Appellant were to be granted leave to remain in the capacity sought  in
    his application he  would  be  prohibited  from  taking  employment  in
    accordance with the condition that would be imposed  on  his  leave  by
    virtue of paragraph 245ZY(c)(iii).


7.   The Respondent expressed the view that she was not satisfied  that  the
    Appellant was "genuinely able to support [him]self  without  attempting
    to work in breach of the conditions of [his] leave", before  concluding
    in these terms: "The Secretary of  State  has  therefore  refused  your
    application because she is not satisfied that you are a genuine student
    as provided in paragraph 245ZX(o) of the Immigration Rules".


8.   It is to be emphasised that the basis of the Respondent's decision  was
    not a past breach of conditions but  rather  the  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant was not a genuine student.  That conclusion appears  to  have
    been reached on the basis of the concerns in respect of the Appellant's
    financial circumstances and the admission that he had been  working  in
    breach of his conditions.


9.   It may readily be appreciated that  the  conclusion  expressed  in  the
    RFRL runs contrary to the 'Recommendations summary' of the interviewing
    officer who had expressed the view that the Appellant appeared to be  a
    genuine student.  It is of course the  case  that  many  students  work
    alongside their studies, and  indeed  certain  categories  of  students
    under the Immigration Rules are expressly granted permission  to  work,
    albeit for limited hours.  It may be thought, therefore, that the  mere
    fact of undertaking employment is not inevitably a  reliable  indicator
    of the genuineness or otherwise  of  an  individual's  intentions  with
    regard to their studies.


10.  It might also be suggested - as  indeed  is  hinted  in  the  grant  of
    permission  to  appeal  -  that  there  is  an   element   of   logical
    inconsistency between the awarding of points  under  the  'Maintenance'
    requirement, and the conclusion that the Appellant  could  not  support
    himself without working.  At first blush it seems to me that there  was
    not an inevitable logical inconsistency with the awarding of points and
    a conclusion that a person could not maintain themselves without taking
    unauthorised employment: in order to secure points it is only necessary
    to demonstrate that a certain level of funds is held in a bank  account
    for a certain period of time, and it may well be that  the  ability  to
    hold such funds is a consequence of unlawful  employment.   However  in
    this context my attention has been directed by Ms Smeaton to Appendix C
    of the Immigration Rules at paragraph 1A(d) in  respect  of  evaluating
    funds under the maintenance requirements: "if the funds  were  obtained
    when the applicant was in the UK the  funds  must  have  been  obtained
    while the applicant had valid leave and was not acting in breach of any
    conditions attached to that leave."  It follows that there  may  indeed
    therefore be some weight to an argument that if the decision-maker  had
    had proper and due regard to the Rules - including paragraph  1A(d)  of
    Appendix C - the awarding  of  points  for  'Maintenance  (Funds)'  was
    indicative of the decision-maker being satisfied that the Appellant had
    secured such funds without having boosted them  through  employment  in
    breach of conditions.


11.  Be that as it may, the Appellant pursued an appeal to  the  Immigration
    and Asylum Chamber. His appeal was dismissed for reasons set out in the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lagunju.



12.  Permission to appeal was sought: in the first instance it  was  refused
    by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Dineen  on  27  April  2017,  but  was
    subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley on 5 June 2017.



13,  In my judgment the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred  in  that  he  has
    failed to identify the basis of the Respondent's decision.



14.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  mischaracterises  the   Respondent's
    decision at paragraph 2 of his own Decision.  The  Judge  states:  "The
    respondent refused the application on  the  basis  that  the  appellant
    failed to meet the requirements of  paragraph  245ZX(c),  in  that,  he
    engaged  in  unauthorised  employment".   As  may  be  seen  from   the
    recitation set out above the basis of the Respondent's decision was not
    paragraph 245ZX(c) but paragraph 245ZX(o), and the fundamental basis of
    the decision was not specifically that the  Appellant  had  engaged  in
    unauthorised employment but that the Appellant was considered not to be
    a genuine student. The Judge has cited the wrong paragraph of the Rules
    and the wrong basis of the Respondent's decision.



15.  There is some further confusion  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    Decision at paragraph 8,  wherein  the  wrong  paragraph  is  cited  in
    respect of the imposition of conditions of  leave  on  the  Appellant's
    past leave and indeed likely future leave were his application to  have
    succeeded. It is also erroneously stated therein that the Appellant had
    previously had limited permission to work, whereas in reality he had no
    permission to work at all.  Whilst this is not  in  itself  a  material
    error - if anything it is an error in favour  of  the  Appellant  -  it
    nonetheless reinforces the notion that the  Judge  failed  properly  to
    understand the basis of the Respondent's decision.



16.  The Judge's reasoning  essentially  comes  down  to  that  set  out  at
    paragraphs 10-11 of the Decision:

         "10.  Given  the  appellant's  admission   and   the   respondent's
             conclusions taken from the appellant's answers in interview, I
             find the respondent has shown that the appellant did  at  some
             stage work in  breach  of  the  terms  of  his  visa  and  the
             employment he undertook  does  not  fall  within  any  of  the
             categories outlined in paragraph 245ZY(c).

         11.   Accordingly  I  find  the  appellant  fails   to   meet   the
             requirements of the Immigration Rules."




17.  It is clear that the Judge, having identified at paragraph  2  that  he
    thought the issue was merely in respect of the breach of condition, and
    having then concluded that  there  had  been  a  breach  of  condition,
    considered that breach to be determinative of  the  appeal.   This  was
    singularly to fail to  address  the  real  basis  of  the  Respondent's
    decision - the allegation that the Appellant was not a genuine student.
     Accordingly, the Judge's error in mischaracterising the nature of  the
    Respondent's decision meant that the Judge did not address the issue in
    the appeal.  Manifestly it cannot be said that the mere fact of  breach
    would support a  conclusion  that  the  Appellant  was  not  a  genuine
    student, and to that extent this Decision cannot be 'saved' by any sort
    of inference from the Judge's conclusion.   In  those  circumstances  I
    have little hesitation in concluding that the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge is vitiated for error of law and must be set aside.



18.  I have discussed with the representatives  today  the  way  forward  in
    respect of remaking the decision in the appeal.



19.  Ms Smeaton urges me to take note of the inadequacy of the  Respondent's
    reasoning  in  the  RFRL  together  with  the  contrasting   favourable
    observation of the interviewing officer in respect of 'genuineness', to
    note the Appellant's evidence  in  respect  of  finances  both  in  his
    witness  statement  and  the  supporting  witness  statements  of   his
    relatives, to take note of what he said in his witness  statement  with
    regard to his history of study in the UK and to conclude on  a  balance
    of probabilities that the Appellant is a genuine student.



20.  Mr Whitwell on behalf of the Respondent suggests that there is in  fact
    only very limited evidence  before  the  Tribunal  of  the  Appellant's
    history of studies, and indeed it  is  primarily  by  way  of  his  own
    assertions in his witness statement  bolstered  by  the  circumstantial
    fact that he has previously been granted successive periods of leave as
    a student.  It is highlighted, however,  that  the  Appellant  has  not
    produced any specific evidence in relation to his studies: I do  indeed
    note that there is an absence of any supporting materials from  any  of
    the institutions at which he has previously studied and an  absence  of
    materials  such  as  coursework  or  other  documents  that  one  might
    reasonably expect a  genuine  student  to  collect  in  the  course  of
    studies.  Whilst I note in this regard it is suggested that a number of
    the institutions that the Appellant  has  studied  at  may  have  since
    closed because he has found himself at more than one institution  where
    the Sponsor's licence was revoked by the Respondent,  it  seems  to  me
    that such a circumstance does not mean that  the  Appellant  would  not
    have his own record of his  contact  with  those  various  institutions
    during his studies and might reasonably be expected  to  have  retained
    some of his coursework.  Mr Whitwell also notes that  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal was made 'on the papers' and that in all of the
    circumstances the most appropriate way of proceeding is  to  remit  the
    matter back to the First-tier Tribunal so that there can  be  a  proper
    adjudication on the key  issue  in  the  case  which  was  not  at  all
    addressed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

21.  I am not unsympathetic to Ms Smeaton's position.  It does  seem  to  me
    that there is a lack of rigour in the reasoning of  the  Respondent  in
    the RFRL.  However, it does not follow that the lack of rigour  in  the
    Respondent's reasoning means that the Appellant  is  indeed  a  genuine
    student; ultimately the burden to show as much is upon him.  The  issue
    has been raised, and it is for the Appellant therefore to  satisfy  the
    Tribunal in this regard.  I do not consider it would be appropriate  to
    reach a conclusion on the basis simply of the available documentary and
    written evidence without affording  both  parties  the  opportunity  of
    exploring the matter by way of oral  hearing.   Accordingly,  in  those
    circumstances, I have reached the conclusion that the most  appropriate
    way of progressing the Appellant's appeal is that it now be remitted to
    the First-tier Tribunal to be considered at an oral hearing before  any
    Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Lagunju with all  issues  at
    large.



22.  The Appellant may indeed now wish to file further evidence  in  respect
    of his studies that goes beyond the evidence already filed  in  respect
    of his finances - and  includes  materials  in  relation  to  his  past
    studies - with a view to establishing his genuineness as a student.   I
    am not going to make any specific directions in this  regard,  but  the
    Appellant is now on notice of the matter being raised and will be aware
    that it is open to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  take  its  own  view
    independently in consequence of any materials that  are,  or  are  not,
    forthcoming - including possibly drawing an adverse inference from  the
    failure to file  any  supporting  evidence  that  might  reasonably  be
    expected to be available to him.

Notice of Decision

23.  The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside.


24.  The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by any Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Lagunju with
    all issues at large.


25.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.


The above represents a corrected transcript of ex tempore reasons  given  at
the conclusion of the hearing'.
