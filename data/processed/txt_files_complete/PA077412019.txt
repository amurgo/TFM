For the Appellant:     Mr Holt, Counsel instructed on behalf of the
Appellant.
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    Introduction:
    Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because
    the case involves protection issues. I find that it is  appropriate  to
    continue the order. Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs
    otherwise, the appellant is  granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these
    proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him.  This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent. Failure to  comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq. On 31  July  2019,  the  respondent
    made an order that the appellant is to  be  deported  from  the  United
    Kingdom ('UK'), following his criminal conviction as it was  considered
    that his presence in the UK was  not  conducive  to  the  public  good.
    Following  representations  made  on  behalf  of  the  appellant,   the
    respondent refused the appellant's protection and human rights claim in
    a decision letter dated 31 July 2019.


 2. The appeal that decision  before  the  FtTJ  (Judge  Kelly)  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on 23  January  2020  judge  Kelly  dismissed  his
    appeal.

 3. Permission to appeal that decision was sought  and  on  10  March  2020
    permission was granted by FtTJ Simpson.

 4. Following a  decision  pursuant  to  Rule  34  UTJ  Coker  reached  the
    conclusion that the decision of Judge Kelly involved the making  of  an
    error on a point of law and set aside the decision to be remade by  the
    Upper Tribunal.  This is the remaking before the Upper Tribunal.



The background:

 5. On 24 June 2018, the appellant entered the UK  clandestinely  by  lorry
    and he claimed asylum the following day having been encountered by  the
    police. His asylum claim was refused on 30 July  2008  and  his  appeal
    against that decision was dismissed by Immigration  Judge  Reid  on  11
    August 2008.

 6. The appellant was granted discretionary leave remain on  19  July  2013
    and this was subsequently extended until 27 August 2016.

 7. He applied (in time) for further leave to remain on 5 August 2016.

 8. During his residence in the United Kingdom he  has  committed  criminal
    offences. On 4 August 2015 he was convicted in the  magistrate's  court
    for assaulting a constable and fined ï¿½50.

 9.  On  17  March  2017  he  was  convicted  of  the   Crown   Court   for
    wounding/inflicting grievous bodily harm (contrary to section 20 of the
    Offences Against the  Person  Act)  and  was  sentenced  to  12  months
    imprisonment following his plea of guilty. The  circumstances  of  that
    offence are set out fully in the sentencing remarks in the respondent's
    bundle. Whilst the  pages  were  not  complete,  a  full  copy  of  the
    sentencing remarks were provided by  counsel.  I  will  return  to  the
    circumstances of the offence later on in this decision.

10. In light of his conviction, a stage 1 notice of decision to deport  him
    was issued on 17 March 2017 and a fresh stage I notice of  decision  to
    deport was served on 19 September 2017. This was responded  to  by  the
    appellant by further representations received on 8  October  2017  from
    his partner and 13 October 2017 from his stepson. On  19  October  2017
    further submissions on asylum grounds  were  received  from  his  legal
    representatives where he made a protection claim  and  a  human  rights
    claim.

11. A decision was made on 31 July 2019 to make a deportation order  and  a
    decision to refuse a protection and human rights claim.

The respondent's decision:

12. In a decision made by the respondent on 31 August 2019 in his claim was
    refused. It was said that the appellant having stated that  his  mother
    and half siblings lived in Iraq and that he spent 27 days visiting  his
    stepsister in Iran in June 2011, he would therefore have the  help  and
    support of family members on return to  Iraq  and  be  able  to  obtain
    assistance from them for a CSID card.

13. As he is an ethnic Kurd, he would be up to relocate  to  and  integrate
    into the IKR (see paragraphs 31 - 40, 77 - 80). He  would  be  excluded
    from humanitarian protection by  virtue  of  paragraph  339  D  of  the
    immigration rules (see paragraphs 85 - 89).

14. In relation to Article 8, whilst it was accepted that the two  children
    were "qualifying children" and that he had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship  with  them,  it  was  not  accepted  that  their
    separation from him following his deportation would be "unduly  harsh",
    given  that  their  mother  is  their  primary  carer,  they  are   not
    financially dependent on him and they can continue their  education  as
    British citizens and will be able to continue their contact  with  them
    by the modern means of communication (see 105 - 110).  As  regards  the
    relationship between the adult children, it was not accepted  that  the
    relationship went beyond normal emotional  ties  between  adult  family
    members. As  regards  his  partner,  in  the  absence  of  satisfactory
    evidence of cohabitation,  is  not  accepted  that  he  had  a  genuine
    subsisting relationship with her. As he spent majority of his  life  in
    Iraq, there were no other  compelling  circumstances  to  outweigh  the
    public interest in his deportation (at paragraph 129).

15. The appellant appealed the decision, and it came before the FtT (Kelly)
    on 2 January 2020.

16. In a decision promulgated on 23 January 2020  the  FtTJ  dismissed  his
    appeal. The factual circumstances of  the  appellant  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs 3 - 9. The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of  Iraq  of  Kurdish
    ethnicity from Kirkuk who left Iraq in 2008 and had not returned  there
    since that date. His claim was that it lost contact with all members of
    his family who may otherwise have been able to assist him in  obtaining
    replacement documents as he no longer has a CSID card.

17. In terms of his family life, the appellant relied upon his relationship
    with his children of his former relationship) and the two  children  of
    the family and also his relationship with his current partner.

18. The judge heard evidence from the appellant and his partner and set out
    his findings at paragraphs 24 - 29. The judge accepted the  appellant's
    evidence concerning his upbringing in Iraq  set  out  at  [24].  As  to
    family relatives in Iraq and the  appellant's  contact  with  them  the
    judge set out his factual findings at  paragraphs  [25]  and  [26]  and
    concluded from the evidence that he did not accept that  the  appellant
    had lost contact with his stepsister N nor that  he  had  lost  contact
    with his other step siblings but accepted that he had lost contact with
    his biological mother.

19. In terms of family life, he was satisfied that the appellant was  in  a
    genuine subsisting  relationship  with  W  (  at  [29])  and  that  the
    genuineness of the appellant's current  relationship  with  his  former
    partners adult children as well as his own children were not in dispute
    by the respondent  at [29]).

20. The FtTJ considered the protection appeal in the light of  the  country
    guidance of SMO and others (Article 15(c); identity documents) Iraq  CG
    [2019] UKUT 00400 ("SMO") and concluded that the appellant's home  area
    of Kirkuk was no longer a "contested area" and could return  there.  He
    did not fall into any of the categories outlined would be  at  risk  of
    harm and whilst the judge considered that "the only contra indicator is
    that he is to some extent now westernised,  he  was  not  satisfied  by
    virtue of that fact alone that it fell within a risk of harm within the
    terms of Article 15(c).

21. Furthermore, at [31] he was satisfied that  the  appellant  would  have
    access to a replacement CSID based on his findings at the appellant had
    not reasonably likely lost contact with his relatives.  He  found  that
    there were no regular flights to the IKR but with its  close  proximity
    to Kirkuk that he could be returned  to  Iraq  via  Erbil  rather  than
    Baghdad. He would therefore not have to travel in order  to  reach  his
    destination for  the  purposes  of  obtaining  a  replacement  identity
    document and a CS ID card in Kirkuk.

22. As to the human rights appeal on Article 8  grounds,  when  considering
    exception 1 the FtTJ found that he had been lawfully resident in the UK
    for a period of only six years out of the total period of 32  years  of
    his life could meet the requirements of the rule thus  could  not  meet
    S117C (4).

23. As to the exception 2, based on his family life,  the  judge   did  not
    accept that the effect of the appellant's deportation upon his  partner
    would be unduly harsh given that she entered into the relationship with
    him at a time when his immigration status was  precarious  pending  the
    application for further extension of his leave made on 5  August  2016.
    She ought to have known it may only been  possible  to  continue  their
    relationship from outside the United Kingdom. He  found  it  to  be  an
    adult in good health and that together with the recent improvements  in
    Kerr Cook it was reasonable for her to relocate should she choose to do
    so.

24. As to the circumstances of the children they were addressed at [32] but
    found  that  when  taking  into  account  the   appellant's   term   of
    imprisonment of 12 months, "I must therefore hold the  public  interest
    outweighs the primary  consideration  of  the  best  interests  of  the
    children unless I conclude that the effect of his deportation upon them
    would  be  "unduly  harsh".  The  judge  concluded  that   whilst   the
    consequences of deportation and their separation  would  be  harsh,  it
    would not be unduly harsh given that their  mother  was  their  primary
    carer, they are not financially dependent on  the  appellant  and  they
    could continue their education the U.K.'s British citizens and will  be
    able to continue their contact with the appellant by  modern  means  of
    communication and visiting him in the IKR.

25. The FtTJ considered his relationship with the adult  stepchildren  that
    concluded that the nature of the relationship nor  the  effect  of  his
    deportation upon them outweighed the public interest in  the  appellant
    deportation. The FtTJ therefore dismissed the appeal.

26. The appellant sought permission to appeal that decision and  permission
    was granted by FtTJ Simpson on 10 March 2020.

27. In light of the  Covid-19  pandemic,  directions  were  made  by  Upper
    Tribunal judge Coker concerning further conduct of the appeal on the 29
    April 2020 and provision was made for the question of whether there was
    an error of law and if so whether the decision of the  FtTJ  should  be
    set aside to be determined on the papers.

28. It is recorded that the appellant complied with the directions but that
    the respondent made no submissions and made  no  risk  request  for  an
    extension of time in order to make such submissions and did not seek an
    oral hearing. There was also no rule 24 response.

29. In the light of the material that was before the Upper Tribunal,  Judge
    Coker reached the conclusion that the appeal  could  be  heard  on  the
    papers and that a decision could  be  made  under  rule  34  without  a
    hearing.

30. UTJ Coker set out her consideration and findings at paragraphs 4-10  of
    her decision as follows:

    "Consideration and findings.

      4. The appellants appeal was against the refusal of his  international
         protection and human rights  claims  which  was  triggered  by  the
         signing of an automatic deportation order following his  conviction
         in March 2017 resulting in a sentence of 12  months'  imprisonment.
         The appellant is from Kirkuk, which is not part of the IKR. The FtT
         judge found that because the appellant's home area (Kirkuk)  is  no
         longer contested he could return there without  being  at  risk  of
         being persecuted  because  he  did  not  fall  within  any  of  the
         identified groups at risk. The judge found that the appellant would
         be able to access a replacement CSID on his return to Iraq and that
         he could be returned to Erbil or Sulaymaniyah and  would  thus  not
         have far to travel to Kirkuk to obtain a replacement CSID.

      5. The first tier Tribunal judge concluded that it would not be unduly
         harsh for the appellant to be separated from  his  current  partner
         who had entered into her relationship with him at a time  when  his
         immigration status was precarious and who in any  event  could,  if
         she chose to, relocate to Iraq with him. The judge also found  that
         the best interests of  the  appellant's  two  minor  children  (the
         mother  of  whom  is  not  his  current  partner)  are  a   primary
         consideration that is to be balanced against the  public  interest.
         The judge concluded that the public interest outweighs the  primary
         consideration of the children's best interests and  that  it  would
         not be unduly harsh for them to be  separated  from  the  appellant
         because inter alia they would be able to visit him in the IKR.

      6. The appellant submits that the judge's finding that  the  appellant
         could travel to Erbil or Sulaymaniyah  is  an  error  of  law  that
         fundamentally impacts upon the decision given that the appellant is
         not returnable to the IKR but would be  returned  to  Baghdad.  The
         appellant also submits that the judge has failed to  make  findings
         as to the risks faced by the appellant travelling from  Baghdad  to
         Kirkuk and to the IKR.

      7. In so far as the private and  family  life  of  the  appellant  are
         concerned, the appellant submits that the first tier Tribunal judge
         has conflated three separate issues namely whether or  not  removal
         would be unduly harsh, the best interests of the children  and  the
         impact of the  appellants'  criminal  contact  conduct  and  public
         interest in removal.

      8. SMO, KSP and IM (Article 15(c); identity documents) Iraq CG  [2019]
         UKUT 00400(IAC) makes clear that only former residents of  the  IKR
         will be returned to the IKR. All other Iraqis will be  returned  to
         Baghdad and the Iraqi authorities will only allow an Iraqi National
         to enter Iraq if they are in possession of  a  current  or  expired
         Iraqi passport or a  laissez  passï¿½.  No  Iraqi  National  will  be
         returnable to  Baghdad  if  not  in  possession  of  one  of  those
         documents. The appellant does not have one of those  documents.  In
         paragraph 31 of the decision, the first tier Tribunal judge  states
         that the appellant would have access to  a  replacement  CSID  card
         from Kirkuk on  his  return  to  Iraq.  The  judge  has  failed  to
         recognise that this appellant would be returning to Baghdad without
         a CSID or  passport  or  laissez  passï¿½.  He  therefore  cannot  be
         returned there. This error on the part of the  judge  impacts  upon
         the conclusion reached regarding the protection claim. The error by
         the judge of the availability of a CSID impacts upon the conclusion
         reached regarding the protection claim. The judge has erred in  law
         in his conclusions on the protection claim.

      9. Although the judge in considering the human rights aspects  of  the
         appellant's appeal refers to those convicted of crimes that lead to
         a sentence of less than 12 months, sentences  of  12  months  to  4
         years and sentences of four years and above, the judge balances the
         best interests of the  children  against  the  public  interest  in
         deportation. There is no sliding scale. The judge makes  a  finding
         that it would not be unduly harsh for the children to be  separated
         from the appellant but the conflation of the best interests of  the
         children in consideration of the  public  interest  of  deportation
         indicates  that  the  judge  has  imported  a  sliding   scale   of
         assessment. The judge has erred in law in his  conclusions  on  the
         human rights claim.

     10. The decision reached by the  First  tier  Tribunal  judge  both  in
         connection with the protection claim appeal and  the  human  rights
         claim appeal is set aside to be remade.  Although  the  conclusions
         are set aside the judge has set out in the  decision  the  evidence
         that was before him and has made findings  of  fact.  There  is  no
         suggestion that the judge has failed to  have  regard  to  evidence
         that was before him and  it  is  therefore  appropriate  that  this
         matter is listed for resumed hearing before an Upper Tribunal judge
         rather than remitted to the first-tier tribunal."

31. Accordingly UTJ Coker  concluded  that  the  decision  of  Judge  Kelly
    involved the making of an error on a point of law  and  set  aside  the
    decision to be remade by the Upper Tribunal.

32. At the same time UTJ Coker set out consequential directions as follows:

      1) the parties to agree a schedule of agreed facts as  found  by  FtTJ
         Kelly, such schedule be filed and served  no  later  than  35  days
         after the sending of this decision.

      2) Both parties have leave to file and serve in  hard  copy  by  email
         such further background evidence as they seek to rely on  no  later
         than 21 days before the resumed hearing. Reference document to  the
         public domain to be identified by hyperlink.

      3) Both parties to file and serve  in  hard  copy  by  email  skeleton
         arguments, with hyperlinks to case law relied upon, no  later  than
         14 days before the resumed hearing.

      4) If either party wishes to call oral evidence, and  applications  to
         be made to the Upper Tribunal, with reasons, no later than 35  days
         after the sending of this decision.

      5) The matter to be set out in all remote  hearing.  If  either  party
         sick subject to remote hearing, any objection must be made detailed
         reasons to the upper Tribunal within seven days of the  sending  of
         this decision. In any event  both  parties  to  provide  the  upper
         Tribunal details of  the  contact  arrangements  to  enable  remote
         hearing to take place.

      6) Other directions related to service of documents.

33. The hearing was listed before the Upper Tribunal as a  resumed  hearing
    on the 9 April 2021.

The re-making decision before the Upper Tribunal:

34. At the resumed hearing both parties were represented by advocates;  the
    Appellant was represented by Mr Holt of Counsel who had represented the
    appellant  previously  and  the  Respondent  by  Mr  Diwnycz  ,  Senior
    Presenting Officer.

The evidence:

35. The Appellant's solicitors had provided a bundle  of  documents  before
    the FtTJ which I had before me. In addition, there were  three  further
    witness statements; Witness statement of the Appellant,  and  one  from
    his current partner and one from his former-wife.

36. The Respondent relied upon the  material  in  the  Respondent's  bundle
    which included the decision letter, a copy of part  of  the  sentencing
    remarks, previous decision of the FtT (Judge Reid) in 2008 and copy  of
    asylum interview, screening interview, application   made  for  ILR  in
    2016 along  with the accompanying documents.

37. Country evidence was filed on behalf of the respondent in the  form  of
    the CPIN dated June 2020.

38. The most recent GC decision of SMO had also been placed before the
    tribunal and formed the basis of the submissions of the parties as
    recorded below.

39. When setting out a directions for the remaking of the appeal, UTJ Coker
    made provision for the appellant to call any oral evidence that he
    required. The appellant's solicitors indicated in correspondence in
    October 2020 and again in March 2021 that further oral evidence would
    be required from the appellant and his partner. In support of the oral
    evidence three witness statements were filed in behalf of the
    appellant, one from the appellant himself, one from his partner and one
    from his former partner.

40. Counsel Mr Holt confirmed that discussions had taken place with his
    instructing solicitors and the appellant and that all consented to the
    appeal taking place by way of remote means, which included the giving
    of evidence of the witnesses and that this had been communicated to the
    tribunal.

41. I heard submissions from the  parties at the outset of the hearing to
    satisfy myself that hearing the appeal by way of a remote hearing would
    be the correct course to take and to ensure that all matters were
    canvassed before the hearing took place and to ensure the fairness of
    the proceedings.

42. Mr Holt confirmed that preparations had taken place for the remote
    hearing and that the appellant and the witnesses were aware of the
    nature of the hearing and had given their consent to do so. Having
    considered the submissions of the parties and having done so in the
    light of the relevant factors both identified in recent case law in the
    family division and the Court of Appeal, the Equal treatment bench book
    and practice directions, I was satisfied that the appeal could be
    conducted fairly by remote means. This was an appeal where the oral
    evidence was limited in its nature and none of the parties required an
    interpreter. There were no issues  of credibility raised concerning the
    evidence of the appellant and his partner; she could provide no
    evidence on issues relevant to Iraq and her evidence as to their
    relationship had been accepted by Judge Kelly as a genuine and
    subsisting relationship when addressing Article 8.

43. No technical problems encountered during the hearing and I am satisfied
    both advocates were able to make their respective cases by the chosen
    means and  I also confirm that at the conclusion of each of the
    witnesses they confirmed to me that they had no difficulties in either
    understanding the questions asked or providing answers to them and
    confirmed that they were able to see and hear the proceedings well.

44. I heard evidence from the appellant, he confirmed the contents of his
    two witness statements which he recalled signing and was satisfied that
    those statements were accurate and true to the best of his belief.
    Those statements were adopted as his evidence in chief.

45. Mr Holt asked only one question of him, which was whether he had ever
    heard of his family book number? The appellant replied "what is that?
    The appellant was asked if he was familiar with it? But the appellant
    said that he was not.

46. In cross-examination he was asked if he remembered the details of his
    CSID and he replied "what is a CSID? When it was described to him by Mr
    Diwnycz as a green card with his name, date of birth and important
    details on it which is used to obtain services and for purposes of
    school he stated, "no I do not remember it". When asked if he recalled
    having had such a card, the appellant stated "no". He confirmed that he
    had attended school in Iraq "for a few years". When asked if he
    recalled his stepsister providing any details as to the card, he said
    "I do not remember stuff like this". He was later asked if he ever had
    an Iraqi passport. The appellant replied "no".

47. When asked if he had ever had an Iraqi ID card he said "I may have it,
    I have not seen it. In Iraq we have a document for food, but he did not
    know if it was still being used for this.

48. In relation to questions about his relationship with the children, he
    stated that he had grown up as an orphan and that he did not want his
    children to grow up in the same way.

49. As to contact with the children, he said that he saw the children
    regularly. When asked about the frequency he stated "it depends;
    sometimes once a week sometimes five times in a week. He confirmed that
    there was no formal contact arrangement in place.

50. When asked questions about contact with his family members in Iraq and
    the last time we had contact with them, he confirmed that he last had
    contact with his stepsister in 2011 in Iran and that was the last time
    that he had seen her and that he had no idea where she was now.

51. When asked if there were other members of the family in Iraq, he
    explained that he had step brothers and stepsisters but that they had
    "taken advantage of me they took things from me; they did not help me,
    I have no contact with them". When asked if he knew where they were? He
    said "not really, they could be anywhere in Iraq. When asked when he
    saw his stepsister in 2011 if she knew where stepsisters and brothers
    were, the appellant stated, "we did not talk about that." He was asked
    if she would have any expectation of knowing where they were? The
    appellant stated "no".

52. It was suggested to him that Kirkuk no longer was experiencing any
    problems as it had in the past as evidenced by the most up-to-date
    material but the appellant in his opinion stated that it was unstable
    and that he based that on having lived there on a daily basis before
    coming to the United Kingdom in 2008.

53. There was no re-examination. By way of a question of clarification I
    asked the appellant to identify who the uncles were who had been
    mentioned in his previous asylum claim. He stated, "on my dad's side,
    they took everything from me." I asked him to confirm if he could if
    there were any other uncles other than those on the downside. He said
    "no". He then explained that the uncles he was referring to were dead
    and they died in 2010. When asked how we knew this, he said he knew
    from contact that it had in 2010. He said they were last in Kirkuk. He
    was asked about the screening interview in which reference is made to
    his uncles providing him with money to the UK. He stated that "I cannot
    remember". Neither advocate had any questions arising out of the
    clarification questions.

54. I also heard oral evidence from the appellant's former partner G. She
    confirmed her witness statement dated 18 March 2021 was her witness
    statement, which he had signed and confirmed that the contents were
    true. This was adopted as evidence in chief. There were no other
    questions in evidence in chief asked by Mr Holt.

55. Turning to cross-examination, she was asked if there were any formal
    arrangements made as to contact. She stated that there were no such
    agreement, but they had decided the issue of contact the children
    between themselves and that it would be "50-50". When asked how
    frequently the appellant saw the children she stated that it was nearly
    every day and that he picked them up from school a few times per week
    and that whilst he does not take them out as a result of the current
    restrictions prior to lockdown he take them to places like the park.
    She explained that when they first went into lockdown he was not
    allowed to see the children but as she had a balcony he would asked to
    see them whilst they were standing on the balcony. When asked to
    confirm the longest period where the appellant had not seen the boys,
    the witness was not sure and referred to his prison sentence. She also
    referred to times when she had been away on holiday. She confirmed that
    he blasted the children three days ago. No further questions were
    asked.

56. The last witness was the appellant's partner who confirmed her two
    witness statements the latest being dated 18 March 2021. Again she
    confirmed the contents of her witness states were true were accurate at
    the time she made them, and they were adopted as evidence in chief.

57. She was asked when the appellant had last seen the boys and she
    confirmed that that was on Easter Sunday for a barbecue. When asked how
    often he would see them in a regular week she replied, "a couple of
    times per week". When asked to provide the longest period of time that
    he had not seen the boys she said that there were times when they had
    been on holiday and there were times during the restrictions because of
    lockdown but that 5 to 7 days would be the longest time that they had
    been apart. She was asked about her language ability and whether she
    had taken the time to learn Kurdish Sorani. She explained that her
    focus was on learning English rather than any other foreign language.

58. There was no re-examination. In a question of clarification as to the
    date of entry to the UK she confirmed that she had entered in May 2013
    after finishing college and that her father had been present in the
    United Kingdom since October 2012. She had her sisters and mother and
    niece living in the United Kingdom. She confirmed that she lived with
    the appellant.

59. At the conclusion of the oral evidence I heard submissions from each of
    the advocates. I shall summarise those submissions.


The submissions of the parties:

60. Mr Diwnycz on  behalf  of  the  respondent  relied  upon  his  skeleton
    argument. I set out in full that skeleton argument.

61. The Secretary of State relies on the decision letter of  31  July  2019
    save for those accepted facts set out above.

62. With respect to the appellant's protection claim SMO, KSP & IM (Article
    15(c); identity documents) CG Iraq UKUT 400(IAC) establishes that there
    is no general Article 15(c) risk to the appellant should he  return  to
    his home area of Kirkuk in Iraq and he has not established  that  there
    are any specific risks that would  sustain  a  claim  for  asylum.  The
    Secretary of State also considers that the finding of the FTT that  the
    appellant retains contact with his family in Iraq means that it is open
    to him to obtain their assistance in re-documentation,  if  it  is  the
    case that they have not, in fact, retained his original documents.

63. With respect to the position of the appellant's relationship  with  his
    children and the assessment of Para 399(a) of the immigration rules the
    Secretary of State's position remains the same as set out in para  105-
    110 of the decision letter. It is not accepted that it would be  unduly
    harsh for them to remain in the UK if the appellant is deported.  Their
    primary carer is their mother.

64. Although the relationship with  Ms  P  has  been  accepted  it  is  not
    accepted  that  the  requirements  of  Para  399(b)  are  met  as   the
    relationship was not entered into when the appellant as lawfully in the
    UK and both parties were aware of the appellant's  precarious  position
    at the time.


65. The Secretary of State does not accept that even when considered
    cumulatively the appellant has established that there are very
    compelling circumstances which could lead to his appeal succeeding.


66. The Secretary of State considers that the appellant has failed to
    establish that he can succeed on the basis of a protection or Human
    rights claim and invites the tribunal to dismiss the appeal.


67. In oral argument Mr  Diwnycz  submitted  that  in  fairness  there  was
    nothing controversial or  any  complaint  about  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant and his partner and that there was  broad  agreement  between
    the witnesses as to the level of contact between the appellant and  the
    children.

68. As to the appellant's evidence concerning contact with family  members,
    Mr Diwnycz accepted that it lost contact with his mother. In respect of
    his uncle had said that they were dead.

69. As to the issue of documentation, the appellant stated he did not  know
    the details of the documents. However  he  submitted  that  when  being
    realistic in light of the June 2020 CPIN document it is not likely that
    he would be able to document himself whilst in the United Kingdom.

70. Reference was made to the decision of SMO being remitted to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the issue of knowledge of the  family  book.  He  submitted
    that at paragraph 3 of the consent order, there was an" open door"  for
    the tribunal to consider any other matter. He confirmed that he was not
    asking  the  tribunal  to  stay  any  decision  to  await   a   further
    consideration by the tribunal. Mr Holt also confirmed there was no such
    application.

71. Mr Holt on behalf of the appellant relied upon  his  skeleton  argument
    filed the day before the hearing. In that document he deals  with  each
    aspect of the issues as follows. He also supplemented  this  with  oral
    submissions. He submitted that in relation to Article 15(c) he did  not
    intend to raise any further submissions beyond those  in  the  skeleton
    argument.

72. He submitted that the appellant was entitled to succeed  on  Article  3
    grounds or in the alternative Article 15(b) on the  basis  of  lack  of
    documentation  and  the   risk   arising   from   this.    As   regards
    redocumentation in the UK, he submitted that the  appellant's  evidence
    was that he was not in possession  of  a  CSID  card  and  that  was  a
    consistent and plausible claim. In particular he invited me to consider
    the appellant's evidence about his own family circumstances that he was
    an orphan as a child and thus was in the least likely  category  to  be
    able to document himself. He invited the tribunal to find that, to  the
    asylum standard, the Appellant has no CSID. No other document would  be
    of any assistance (see decision in AAH where a laissez  passï¿½  document
    would be confiscated upon arrival).


73. As to the issue of redocumentation, he referred to the respondent's
    guidance on this issue. As per paragraph 2.6.16 of the Home Office
    Country Policy and Information Note entitled: "Iraq: Internal
    relocation, civil documentation and returns", version 11.0, dated June
    2020 (hereafter "the June 2020 CPIN"):

         "it is highly unlikely that an individual would be able to obtain a
         CSID from the Iraqi Embassy while in the UK. Instead a person would
         need to apply for a registration document (1957) and would then
         apply for an INID upon return to their local CSA office in Iraq."

74. According to the Home Office's own guidance, therefore, it cannot be
    reasonably argued that the Appellant is able to redocument himself
    whilst in the UK.


75. Further the Appellant has always claimed that he has lost contact with
    his family in Iraq. His last contact, he says, was when he spoke to his
    maternal uncle over the phone when the Appellant had fled to Erbil as
    part of his departure from Iraq. He has made efforts to reconnect with
    his family to no avail. It is submitted that, given that the Hashd-al-
    Shabi incursion into Kirkuk is accepted as being the reason for the
    Appellant's fleeing from Qara-Dara, the Appellant's account of having
    lost contact with his family is, at the very least, plausible. Notably,
    the Respondent has neither accepted nor disputed the Appellant's claim
    to have lost contact with his family, giving no reasons as to why this
    specific aspect of the Appellant's claim should be disbelieved.

76. Without these details, it is highly unlikely that the Appellant would
    be able to obtain replacement documentation at the Iraqi consulate in
    the UK, ï¿½1.8, AB140, also at ï¿½26 AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal
    relocation) Iraq CG UKUT 00212.

77. According to SMO ï¿½425(ï¿½45), "The likelihood of obtaining a replacement
    identity document by the use of a proxy, whether from the UK or on
    return to Iraq, has reduced due to the introduction of the INID
    system." As per ï¿½393 of SMO, "If an individual genuinely has no
    relevant documents to present, via a proxy, to the relevant CSA office,
    if they genuinely do not know the volume and page reference in the
    civil register, and if they genuinely cannot contact a family member
    from whom those details cannot be obtained, there will be no realistic
    prospect of that person obtaining a CSID remotely upon return to
    Baghdad."

78. The Upper Tribunal is therefore invited to find that the Appellant
    would be unable to redocument himself whilst outside Iraq.

79. As to re documentation within Iraq, he submitted that the Appellant
    would be returned to Baghdad on a laisser passez, enabling travel
    between the UK and Baghdad. These are confiscated upon arrival (AAH
    (Iraq) CG [2018] UKUT 212, ï¿½35 and headnote 12 of SMO).


80. As per headnote 16 of SMO, KSP & IM (Article 15(c); identity documents)
    Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 400 (IAC), obtaining a replacement CSID is now
    unlikely to be possible where the person seeking the document is from a
    governate where the INID system has been rolled out:

         "The CSA offices in which INID terminals have been installed are
         unlikely - as a result of the phased replacement of the CSID system
         - to issue a CSID, whether to an individual in person or to a
         proxy."

81. As per paragraph 431 of SMOï¿½ "It is likely, to our mind, that the CSA
    office in Kirkuk has an INID terminal and that it would not be willing
    to issue a CSID to the appellant through a proxy ..." Kirkuk is
    therefore one of those cities in which the INID system has been rolled
    out.


82. In order to obtain an INID, the Appellant would have to attend the CSA
    office in Kirkuk in person, as per ï¿½45 of SMO:

         "In order to obtain an INID, an individual must attend their  local
         CSA  office  in  person  to  enrol  their   biometrics,   including
         fingerprints and iris scans."

83. The Appellant would be returned to Baghdad, not the KRI. As per ï¿½4.2.1
    of the June 2020 CPIN,

         "There are international flights  to  Erbil  International  Airport
         (EBL) and Sulamaniyah  International  Airport  (ISU).  However,  it
         should be noted that all enforced returns are to Baghdad  and  that
         only those willing to return voluntarily can travel directly to the
         KRI."

84. In order to obtain a new INID, the Appellant would therefore have to
    travel along the Baghdad-Kirkuk road. This has been a major security
    hotspot over the years, which, although security there is better than a
    few years ago, still experiences serious security breaches.


85. The FTT is bound by the decision in SMO, which at ï¿½425(ï¿½40) provides
    [emphasis added]:

         "The CSID is being replaced with a  new  biometric  Iraqi  National
         Identity Card - the INID.  As a general matter, it is necessary for
         an individual to have one of these two documents in order  to  live
         and travel within Iraq without encountering treatment or conditions
         which are contrary to Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the checkpoints  in
         the country are manned by Shia militia who are  not  controlled  by
         the GOI and are unlikely to permit an individual without a CSID  or
         an INID to pass.  A valid  Iraqi  passport  is  not  recognised  as
         acceptable proof of identity for internal travel."


    Article 15(c) in Kirkuk


86. The Tribunal in SMO held that the question  of  whether  an  individual
    Appellant would face a risk of  treatment  contrary  to  Article  15(c)
    requires a fact-sensitive, "sliding scale" assessment to which a number
    of matters are relevant. Those matters include:

      i) Whether the area retains an active ISIL presence;


     ii) Whether there is membership of a minority ethnic group;


    iii) Whether there are disabilities;


     iv) Whether the returnee is a "child" without family support.



87. According to ï¿½252 of SMO, "ISIL controls no territory as such in Kirkuk
    governorate, but it is certainly present and  active,  particularly  in
    the areas surrounding Hawija and the  Hamrin  Mountains.".  This  is  a
    factor in favour of a positive A15C finding.

88. When this is coupled with the Appellant's age  (33)  and  his  lack  of
    family connections it is submitted that  the  "sliding-scale"  approach
    required in SMO leads to the sensible  conclusion  that  the  Appellant
    would face a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 15C in Kirkuk.

89. Mr Holt submitted that the appellant should  not  be  excluded  from  a
    grant of humanitarian protection as set out in the decision letter.  He
    provided to the Tribunal a copy of the Court of Appeal decision  in  AH
    (Algeria) [2012] EWCA Civ.

90. Mr Holt turned to the issue of family life and Exception 2.

91. The Appellant's imprisonment of 12 months categorises him just into the
    "middle  category"  for  the  purpose  of   assessing   exceptions   to
    deportation.


92. It is submitted that the exception at  s.117C(5)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  applies,  namely  that  the  public
    interest does not require the  Appellant's  deportation  as  he  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child,
    and the effect of his deportation on the  partner  or  child  would  be
    unduly harsh.

93. It  is  submitted  that  the  evidence  of  W,  the  Appellant,  and  G
    demonstrates that the Appellant has a particularly  close  relationship
    with his children K and D, and that the effect of his removal upon them
    would be unduly harsh. It is submitted that the effect on  W  would  be
    similarly harsh.

94. In summary, the Appellant is unable to return safely to Kirkuk, and
    therefore unable to redocument himself. As per SMO, he therefore faces
    a real risk of harm throughout Iraq.


95. The effect of the Appellant's deportation upon his partner and children
    would be unduly harsh.

96. In his oral argument he accepted that the test was an  "elevated  test"
    but that it was met on the factors here. In  particular  he  submitted,
    the appellant's background deserved weight; he was a former orphan  and
    had said it is evidence that he did not want the same thing  to  happen
    to his boys to grow up without a father.

97. He submitted that the well-being of the children met the test, and that
    the child D was experiencing some degree of  learning.  When  asked  to
    identify the evidence in support, he confirmed that it was set  out  in
    the witness statement at paragraph 3 of his partner but confirmed  that
    there was no diagnosis of this but that there was some issue with D'  s
    learning. He submitted  that  there  was  a  subjective  assessment  of
    closeness with all of the children and in conclusion this would satisfy
    the elevated test of "unduly harsh". He therefore invited the  tribunal
    to allow the appeal as section 117C(4)  Exception 2 was met.

98. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my  decision  which  I  now
    give.

The legal framework:
99. The appellant bears the burden of substantiating the primary facts of
    his protection claim. The standard is a reasonable degree of
    likelihood.




100. Under Section 32 (5) of the UK Borders Act 2007, the Secretary of
    State must make a deportation order in respect of a "foreign criminal".
    The principle does not apply if the removal of the foreign criminal in
    pursuance of the deportation order would breach that person's rights
    under the European Convention of Human Rights ("ECHR") or the United
    Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention.




101. Part 5A (sections 117A-117D) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 (inserted by amendment in 2014) is entitled "Article 8
    of the ECHR: public interest considerations." Section 117A explains
    when Part 5A applies:


         "(1) this part applies where a court or tribunal is required to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts


               a) breaches are persons right to respect for private and
                  family life and Article 8, and


               b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the human
                  rights act 1998.


         (2)  in considering the public interest question, the court or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard:


             (a)  in all cases to the considerations listed in section
             117B, and


             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.


      3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means the
         question of whether an interference with the person's right to
         respect for private and family life is justified under Article 8
         (2).


102. Section 117B lists certain public interest considerations to which the
    court or Tribunal must have regard in all such cases. These include the
    considerations that:


         "(1) The maintenance of effective immigrations controls is in the
         public interest.


         (2)  it is in the public interest, and in particular the interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
         seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak
         English, because persons who can speak English - (a) are less of a
         burden on taxpayers, and (B) are able to integrate into society.


      3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
         the economic well-being of United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
         because such persons - (A) are not a burden on taxpayers, and (b)
         are better able to integrate into society.


      4) Little weight should be given to -


             (a)  a private life, or


             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.


      5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
         person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.


      6) ...


103. Section 117C lists additional considerations to which the court or
    Tribunal must have regard in cases involving "foreign criminals"
    (defined in a similar way to the 2007 Act). These considerations are:


         "(1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
         interest.
         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
         (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ('C') who has not been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
         public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
         Exception 2 applies.

104. S 117 C(1) of the 2002 Act provided the deportation of "foreign
    criminals" is in the public interest for the purposes of determining
    the proportionality of deportation under Article 8( 2) of the ECHR.



105.  The appellant satisfies the definition of foreign criminal as he is
    not a British citizen and has been convicted of an offence which led to
    a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months: see section 117D (2) of
    the 2002 Act.




106. The appellant's conviction falls into section 117C (3) of the 2002
    Act; he has not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four
    yours or more, with the effect that, if Exception 1 or 2 applies, his
    deportation will not be in the public interest. Those exceptions are:


         (4)  Exception 1 applies where - (a) C has been lawfully resident
         in the United Kingdom for most of C's life, (b) C is socially and
         culturally integrated in the United Kingdom, and (c) there would be
         very significant obstacles to C's integration into the country to
         which C is proposed to be deported.


         (5)  Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.


         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
         requires deportation unless there are very compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
         2.


         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
         into account where a court or Tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted."

107. Subsection (6) also applies to foreign criminals sentenced to less
    than four years imprisonment. The extent to which an individual
    satisfies the criteria in Exceptions 1 and 2, even if not meeting their
    requirements fully, is relevant to the assessment of "very compelling
    circumstances..." (I refer to NA (Pakistan) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 662.




108. A "qualifying partner" includes a person who is ordinarily resident in
    the UK without being subject under the immigration laws to any
    restriction on the period for which he may remain, and a "qualifying
    child" includes a child who is a British citizen (section 117D (1) of
    the 2002 Act and section 33(2A) of the Immigration Act 1971).


Analysis of the evidence:

The Appellant's factual claim:

109. The Upper Tribunal expressly invited the parties to agree a schedule
    of agreed facts as found by FtTJ Kelly.


110. They are as follows:

       . It is agreed that the Appellant is an Iraqi Kurd from Kirkuk.


       . It is agreed that the family background of the Appellant is as set
         out in para 24 of the FTT determinations. The A was brought up by
         his step-sister (N) following the death of his father and
         remarriage of his mother whilst he was still a young child. He has
         two other step-sisters and two step-brothers, all of whom are
         children from father's previous marriage.


       . It is agreed that the Appellant has lost contact with his mother as
         per para 27 of the FTT determinations.


       . It is agreed that KAK and DK are qualifying children, and that the
         Appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with
         them. He has an amicable contact arrangement with Ms R to maintain
         contact with KAK and DK.


       . It is agreed that the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with his partner. W.


       . It is agreed that the Appellant has genuine relationship with Ms
         R's adult children as per para 29 of the FTT determinations.


       . The facts not in dispute as stated in paragraph 6 of the FTT
         determinations.

111. The Secretary of State also considered that the previous finding of
    Judge Kelly in paras 25 and 26 of his determination that the appellant
    has not lost contact with his step-siblings is a sustainable finding
    that should be retained but this has not been accepted by the appellant
    ( see skeleton argument).

112. I have set out above the factual  findings  which  are  agreed  by  the
    parties and form the basis of my factual assessment.

113. It is necessary to consider all relevant evidence before reaching a
    holistic assessment of the credibility of the Appellant's account.
    However, the credibility of his account can also be assessed
    holistically by looking at its consistency and plausibility, as above,
    and also by comparing it to what is known about Iraq.

114. There is no dispute that the appellant is a national of Iraq and is of
    Kurdish ethnicity who entered the UK on 24 June 2008 when he was 21
    years of age and claimed asylum the following day. The basis of his
    claim for asylum was dismissed by immigration judge Reid in a decision
    promulgated on 11 August 2008. A copy of that decision is in the papers
    at C1, where it was made plain that the judge rejected his factual
    account that he had been visited on three occasions by a group of men
    who had asked him to make metal boxes to be attached to cars and that
    he had been targeted by a particular group of people who were
    terrorists. The judge concluded that his account of being at risk of
    harm in Iraq was not credible and thus reached the conclusion that he
    had not discharged the burden of proof to demonstrate that he was at
    serious risk of harm or persecution on return to Iraq.

115. It is also not in dispute that he was granted discretionary leave to
    remain on 19 July 2013 and subsequently extended until 27 August 2016.
    He had made an application (in time) a further leave to remain on 5
    August 2016, but this was refused some three years later in 2019 in the
    context of the appellant's deportation.

116. As to his family background, it is accepted that he was brought up by
    his stepsister, N, in Kirkuk following the death of his father and the
    remarriage of his mother whilst he was still a very young child. He is
    only seen his mother on two occasions throughout his entire life. N is
    the daughter of his father by previous marriage.

117. As to the relatives, the appellant has two other stepsisters as well
    as two stepbrothers all of whom are the children of his father's
    previous marriage. Judge Kelly considered that "the appellant appears
    to have no reason to lie about this aspect of his family history and I
    therefore accept it" ( at [24] of his decision). There is no reason for
    me to depart from this decision.

118. The issue I have to resolve is whether the appellant is in contact
    with N or any of his family in Iraq. The written submissions made on
    behalf of the respondent were to the effect that the factual findings
    made by Judge Kelly at [25 - 26] resolved this issue. Mr Holt on behalf
    of the appellant seeks to reopen this issue and relies upon the
    evidence of the appellant to demonstrate that there is a reasonable
    likelihood that he has lost contact with his family.

119. FtTJ Kelly at [25] considered the appellant's evidence that he was not
    in contact with N since 2011 but reached the conclusion that he did not
    believe that the appellant had lost contact with N. He placed
    particular weight and the fact that the appellant had met N in June
    2011 while she was seeking medical treatment in Iran.

120. At [26] FtTJ Kelly considered the circumstances in which he had met N
    in 201. This was because he was anxious to retrieve family photographs
    to help him trace his origins and family history. The judge found that
    to be credible however what he did not find credible was that having
    obtained the items from N who acted as his mother by bringing him up as
    her own child, that he would voluntarily cease any further contact with
    her. The judge considered the appellant's explanations for the
    cessation of contact which included a desire to have nothing further to
    do with anything or anyone from Iraq and a fear that he might put her
    life in danger if he were to make further contact after meeting her in
    Iran. It is plain at [26] that he found the claim of not wanting to
    have anything to do with Iraq was "incongruous with his reason for
    arranging to meet in the first place" and that is claim that he might
    put her life in danger was one to be "short on detail and inconsistent
    with his admission that he regularly, if infrequently, spoke to her by
    telephone between 2008 and 2011". The judge also rejected his claim
    that he had not entered his number in the memory of his telephone and
    had lost the piece of paper which had the number. He therefore
    concluded that his claim to have lost contact with N lacked
    credibility. He also found that his claim to have lost contact with his
    other stepsiblings were undermined.

121. The findings of FtTJ Kelly that the appellant has not established  that
    he has lost contact with his  step  sister  in  Kirkuk,  are  only  the
    'starting point' in my reaching  findings  applying  Devaseelan  [2002]
    UKIAT 00702.

122. Mr Diwnycz on behalf of  the  respondent  did  not  seek  to  make  any
    submissions on whether he was in contact with his relatives.

123. I therefore considered the  appellant's  evidence  concerning  loss  of
    contact. It is right to observe that the last  time  he  spoke  to  his
    uncle was when he fled to Erbil as part of his journey  from  Iraq.  No
    findings are made by FtTJ Kelly as to whether he had any  contact  with
    his uncle since he had left Iraq. Given the length  of  time  that  has
    elapsed since 2008, I am prepared to accept that he has had no  contact
    with his uncle and that it is reasonably likely that his  lost  contact
    with him.

124. As to his stepsister N, the  evidence  of  the  appellant  is  that  he
    reiterates that he has had no contact with her since 2011 and maintains
    whilst he could have been clearer in his responses to judge Kelly,  the
    judge did accept that he had no reason to lie about his family  history
    (see paragraph 3 of the witness statement). He  described  having  last
    contact with her in 2011 and not being sure if she was dead or alive.

125. I take into account that the appellant left Iraq in June 2008 which  is
    some 12 years ago. However, it is the appellant's own evidence that  he
    was able to keep in contact with N between 2008 and 2011  by  telephone
    and their contact was sufficient to enable him to meet her in  Iran  in
    2011. As set out in the  decision  of  Judge  Kelly,  he  made  factual
    findings from the appellant's evidence in which he rejected his account
    of having lost contact with N for the reasons given and cited above.  I
    have heard no new evidence that would undermine  that  overall  finding
    that he had not lost contact with N and the findings made relate to the
    particular relationship the appellant  had  with  N  and  the  lack  of
    credibility in the explanations given as to why and  how  he  had  lost
    contact. The appellant has not  provided  any  further  elucidation  of
    those points during his oral evidence. I recognise that  a  significant
    time has elapsed since 2011, but beyond the appellant reiterating  that
    he has lost contact, he has provided no further evidence  on  which  to
    undermine those findings that were carefully made by Judge Kelly.

126. However, that said, I consider that I  reach  a  different  finding  as
    regards his other stepsiblings. The appellant's oral evidence  is  that
    he has not had cordial relationships with those stepsiblings even  when
    in Iraq and that it was N who had stood in the shoes of his mother  and
    brought him up. There is no reference in the earlier  evidence,  either
    before judge Reid or Judge Kelly as  to  any  particular  contact  with
    those relatives. The only evidence really related to the  circumstances
    of N who was in a different position to that of the other stepsiblings.

127. It is correct to observe that FtTJ Kelly did not make reference to  any
    positive evidence concerning contact with the  other  stepsiblings  but
    considered his claim to have lost contact with them in the  context  of
    his finding that he had not lost contact with N. As I  have  said,  the
    evidence demonstrated that the appellant  had  different  relationships
    with N as opposed to his stepsiblings.

128. Furthermore, I bear in mind the self-direction, known  in  the  context
    of  criminal  trials  as  the  "  Lucas  direction"  which  applies  in
    international protection proceedings as the Court of Appeal  recognised
    in Uddin v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 338 at  [11]  (per  Sir  Ernest  Ryder,
    SPT):

         "I note in that regard the conventional warning which  judges  give
         themselves that a person may be untruthful  about  one  matter  (in
         this case his history) without necessarily being  untruthful  about
         another (in this case the existence of family life with the  foster
         mother's family), known as a 'Lucas  direction'  (derived  in  part
         from the judgment of the CACD in  R v Lucas [1981] QB 720 per Lord
         Lane CJ at 723C). The classic formulation of the principle is  said
         to be this: if a court concludes that a witness has lied about  one
         matter, it does not follow that he has  lied  about  everything.  A
         witness may lie for  many  reasons,  for  example,  out  of  shame,
         humiliation, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear,  distress,  confusion,
         and emotional pressure. That is because a person's motives  may  be
         different as respects different questions. The warning is not to be
         found in the judgments before this court. This is perhaps a  useful
         opportunity to emphasise that the utility of the self-direction  is
         of general application and  not  limited  to  family  and  criminal
         cases. "

129.  I  have  therefore  concluded  that  in  the  light  of  his  lack  of
    relationship with those stepsiblings whilst in Iraq against the lack of
    references to them in his claim since 2008, I do not find  that  it  is
    reasonably likely that simply because he has not lost contact  with  N,
    that he has not lost contact with the stepsiblings.

130. I now turn to the issue of documentation.  In  his  oral  evidence  the
    appellant did not recall what a CSID was or what was contained  in  it.
    In his oral evidence he accepted that he might have had an ID  card  in
    Iraq although we did not know if this was a document that was used  for
    food. As for the family book and the reference to  that,  his  evidence
    was to the effect that he did not know what the family book was nor did
    he recall the number, if indeed  that  was  the  book  that  was  being
    referred to during the questions were put to him.

131. The importance of the CSID was set out in the decision of AA (Iraq)  as
    it is required to access financial assistance,  employment,  education,
    and housing etc. it was described as an "essential document for life in
    Iraq" (at [39] AA (Iraq) [2017]).

132.  I  consider  that  the  appellant's  evidence  in  some  respects   is
    inconsistent with the country materials.  The  appellant's  failure  to
    recall what a CSID is, is in my judgement inconsistent with the country
    materials concerning the importance of such a  document.  I  take  into
    account that he left Iraq in 2008 but at the time he  left  he  was  an
    adult aged 21, he had been working in Kirkuk  and  also  had  undergone
    some education. The point made by Mr Holt that he  was  an  orphan  and
    thus the lack of documentation  may  be  seen  plausible  against  that
    background, fails to  take  into  account  in  my  judgement  that  the
    appellant's evidence was that he was brought up by his stepsister N who
    would reasonably be expected to have some documentation to  ensure  his
    general access to services and well-being whilst in Iraq.

133. Against that background it is not reasonably likely that he  would  not
    know what a CSID was given its importance within Iraqi life. However Mr
    Diwnycz accepted that the appellant does not have a CSID, and  this  is
    consistent with the appellant's claim made in 2008  that  he  lost  his
    Iraqi documents whilst travelling through Iran.

134. As to the family book, I bear in mind what was said in at [392] of  SMO
    and others, which considers that the number of individuals who  do  not
    know or could not ascertain the volume or page  number  will  be  quite
    small. The tribunal found the details of the  volume  and  page  number
    appears on a number of important documents and is of  significance.  At
    [392] the tribunal considered that those who  would  plausibly  not  be
    able to provide those details were those identified as  being  mentally
    ill, problems with literacy or numeracy. The appellant would  not  fall
    into those categories. However, as both advocates have  stated,  whilst
    the UT in SMO  reached  that  conclusion,  the  Court  of  Appeal  have
    remitted by consent the sustainability of  the  conclusion  that  Iraqi
    citizens could be expected to recall their entry in  the  family  book.
    That assessment is outstanding. Neither advocates sought a stay pending
    further consideration by the Upper Tribunal  and  no  submissions  were
    made by either of them that such a stay  would  be  reasonable  in  the
    circumstances. It seems to me that that issue  now  having  formed  the
    basis of a remittal by consent, that it would not be right  for  me  to
    place weight upon that assessment. Furthermore,  given  the  length  of
    time that has been absent from Iraq since 2008, I am prepared  to  find
    that it is not reasonably likely that he would necessarily recall  such
    details.

135. As to the issue of family life, I make  the  following  findings  which
    are not in dispute. The appellant met  his  former  partner  G  shortly
    after his arrival in the UK in 2008. The parties were married on 7 June
    2010. She has two children (now adults)  as  a  result  of  a  previous
    relationship (J and L).  J is within the autistic spectrum. They  lived
    together and during the course of their relationship to  children  were
    born, namely K in 2009 and D born in 2013. The appellant  also  is  the
    father of British twins aged five with whom he has never had contact.

136. The parties separated in or about 2013  following  the  birth  of  D  .
    Following separation, the  appellant  has  continued  to  have  a  good
    relationship with J and L; J sometimes sleeps at his home.  In  respect
    of the younger children K and D, he  has  regular  contact  with  those
    children with the approval of their mother. Whilst there is  no  formal
    arrangement (in the terms of an agreement as to  when  and  where  such
    contact should take place), the appellant has regular contact with  the
    children. There is no dispute that the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with the younger children.

137. As Mr  Diwnycz  submitted,  there  was  no  inconsistency  between  the
    witnesses as to the level of contact  between  the  appellant  and  the
    younger children. The  evidence,  I  accept  was  consistent  from  the
    witnesses  was  that  the  appellant  had  regular  contact  with  both
    children. This was characterised by them often and spending  time  with
    him being taken out for the day and that he had taken them  to  school.
    Both children have provided letters in the bundle (pages  14  and  15);
    the letter from K makes reference  to  their  father  taking  them  out
    everywhere and that both of them love their father would  not  like  to
    see him deported.

138.  The appellant has a new relationship with W,  a  Polish  national  and
    they have been in a relationship since April 2013. They live  together.
    In her evidence, she referred to the  appellant  maintaining  a  loving
    relationship with his children and  maintaining  regular  contact.  She
    states that she could not relocate  to  Iraq  because  she  would  have
    several difficulties in adjusting to life there and would not  also  be
    able to bear the pain of separation should he be deported.  She  refers
    them having lived together for almost 4 years and that  the  impact  on
    her family including her parents and sisters would be  "massive".  They
    treat him as part of the family.

139. Having made those findings of fact it is now necessary to undertake  an
    analysis of the issues outlined by the parties  in  their  written  and
    oral submissions.

Exclusion from Humanitarian Protection:

140. By reference to  the  decision  letter,  Mr  Holt  submitted  that  the
    respondent had made a mistake by stating that it was not  discretionary
    but mandatory. That was not consistent with the case law and  that  the
    only question of discretion involved was in assessing whether the crime
    was  a  "serious  crime"  and  the  factors  that  were  relevant  were
    summarised at paragraph [54] of AH (Algeria) [2012] EWCA Civ.

141. He submitted that there were reasons for reaching the  conclusion  that
    this was not a serious crime  so  as  to  exclude  the  appellant  from
    humanitarian protection. He submitted  that  this  was  an  offence  of
    wounding and that  whilst  it  may  appear  serious,  when  looking  at
    paragraph 52 of AH (Algeria) it makes it  plain  that  the  connotation
    "serious" has shades of meaning  and  that  what  might  appear  to  be
    serious may not be serious when looked in its context.  It  is  further
    important to recognise that the offence must be serious enough to  take
    away or exclude someone from an important right.

142. He submitted when  looking  at  the  judge's  sentencing  remarks,  the
    appellant was sentenced to a period of 12  months  imprisonment  having
    pleaded guilty to an offence under section 20. The  judge  referred  to
    the appellant and the complainant  "both  behaving  disgracefully"  and
    that the sentencing remarks refer to the altercation being based  on  a
    dispute about a partner. He submitted it  was  important  to  recognise
    that the judge made reference to the high level of provocation from the
    complainant and that this was a mitigating factor and when  looking  at
    the  injuries  whilst  unpleasant  they  were  relatively   superficial
    although he conceded the judge  sentenced  him  on  the  basis  of  the
    appellant lashing out at him. He submitted it was a  nasty  injury  but
    not the worst of its type and that he was under attack by someone  with
    a metal bar. In terms of mitigating  circumstances  he  pleaded  guilty
    although not at the earliest opportunity.

143. He further submitted that the judge summarised the aggravating  factors
    and also the mitigating factors and the personal mitigation.  In  terms
    of length of imprisonment of 12 months this was at the lower end of the
    scale  for  such  an  offence.  Thus  taken  together,  there   was   a
    preponderance of mitigating factors, this was a low  sentence,  and  it
    was important to consider the part  played  by  the  appellant  in  the
    offence but  also  the  complainant.  Therefore  he  submitted  it  was
    sufficient  to  conclude  that  on  the  facts  of  this  offence   and
    considering all the general factors in relation to aggravating features
    and mitigation, it was not so serious to warrant exclusion from a grant
    of humanitarian protection.

144. Mr Diwnycz made no submissions in respect of this issue .


145. Paragraph 339D of the Immigration Rules provides as follows:

         '339D. A person is excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection
         for the purposes of paragraph 339C  (iv)  where  the  Secretary  of
         State is satisfied that:

         (i) there are  serious  reasons  for  considering  that  they  have
         committed a crime against peace,  a  war  crime,  a  crime  against
         humanity, or any other serious crime  or  instigated  or  otherwise
         participated in such crimes;

         (ii) there are serious  reasons  for  considering  that  they  have
         guilty of acts contrary to  the  purposes  and  principles  of  the
         United Nations or have committed, prepared, or instigated such acts
         or encouraged or induced others to  commit,  prepare  or  instigate
         such acts;

         (iii)  there  are  serious  reasons  for  considering   that   they
         constitute a danger to the community or  to  the  security  of  the
         United Kingdom; or

         (iv) there are serious  reasons  for  considering  that  they  have
         committed a serious crime; or

         (v) prior to their admission  to  the  United  Kingdom  the  person
         committed a crime outside the scope of (i) and (iv) that  would  be
         punishable by imprisonment where it committed in the United Kingdom
         and the person left their country of  origin  solely  in  order  to
         avoid sanctions resulting from the crime.

146. Paragraphs 339D of the Immigration Rules excludes  a  person  from  any
    claim to humanitarian protection where (see 339 D(i)) the Secretary  of
    State is satisfied that he has committed a serious crime, and  "serious
    crime" is defined  as any crime for which a sentence  of  at  least  12
    months has been imposed. Whether a serious crime had been committed  is
    not a matter that was subject to the rebuttal provisions  in  the  2002
    Act in the humanitarian protection context  as  it  is  in  the  asylum
    context.  Paragraph reads "serious reasons for  considering  a  serious
    crime has been committed."

147. The rule in 339D(i) is without qualification and  the  decision  letter
    at paragraph 87 refers to "exclusion  of  this  rule  is  mandatory  in
    respect of persons falling within its scope and there is  no  provision
    to exercise discretion.". Mr Holt on behalf of  the  appellant  submits
    that that is in error and that  it  requires  a  consideration  of  the
    circumstances of the offence  (I  refer  to  his  submissions  outlined
    above).

148. Whilst the rule  refers  to  the  length  of  sentence  as  determining
    whether a serious crime has been committed, the respondent's policy  on
    humanitarian protection version 5.0 last updated in  2017  states  that
    the length of sentence alone should not determine  the  seriousness  of
    the offence for exclusion purposes. Reference is made to  the  decision
    in AH (Algeria) (as cited), and that the sentence is a material  factor
    but not a benchmark and that when deciding whether a crime  is  serious
    enough to justify loss of  protection,  the  tribunal  must  take  fact
    matters into account, with regard to the nature of the crime, the  part
    played by the accused in its commission, any mitigating or  aggravating
    features and the eventual penalty imposed. The  policy  guidance  makes
    reference to examples of serious crimes including, but not limited  to,
    murder, rape, arson,  and  armed  robbery.  It  is  stated  that  other
    offences which might be regarded as serious can include those which are
    accompanied by the use of deadly weapons, in  full  serious  injury  to
    persons, or if there is evidence of serious habitual criminal  conduct.
    The crimes that are not accompanied by violence,  such  as  large-scale
    fraud, may also be regarded as serious but the purposes of exclusion.

149. I note that the respondent made no reference to  the  circumstances  of
    the offence or any of those issues  when  reaching  the  conclusion  at
    paragraph 87  -  89  that  he  should  be  excluded  from  humanitarian
    protection and the only consideration applied was  the  conviction  and
    sentence of 12 months imprisonment. I further note that the  only  part
    relied upon is paragraph 399D (i) and not (iii) which refers to serious
    reasons for considering that he constitute a danger to the community or
    the security  of  the  UK.  No  reference  is  made  to  the  appellant
    constituting any danger to the community either in the decision  letter
    on behalf of the respondent or the submissions during this hearing.

150. I have given consideration to the issue of whether  there  are  serious
    reasons for considering that the  appellant  has  committed  a  serious
    crime and has done so in the  light  of  the  sentencing  remarks.  The
    appellant pleaded guilty to an offence of wounding contrary to  section
    20 of the Offences  Against  the  Person  Act  1861  to  which  he  was
    sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. The judge determined that  on  the
    facts of the case (but taking into account the basis of plea)  that  it
    fell within category two of the guidelines, which is a  starting  point
    of 18 months.

151. It is plain from reading the sentencing remarks that there had  been  a
    basis of plea entered on the appellant's  behalf  which  had  not  been
    disputed by the prosecution. Unfortunately, the full basis of  plea  is
    not set out in the sentencing remarks but there is  reference  made  to
    this in the concluding parts of the sentencing remarks by  Counsel  for
    the defence who stated that the appellant on the basis of plea did  not
    cause the injuries with the weapon. Therefore whilst the appellant  was
    charged with section 20 the basis of the plea  was  that  any  injuries
    caused were not caused by the use of a  weapon  by  the  appellant.  No
    other circumstances were described and therefore I am bound by what  is
    reflected in the sentencing remarks themselves.

152. A careful reading of the remarks indicate that the incident involved  a
    complainant who himself had been involved in the incident and that  the
    appellant had been under attack by him and that he had had a metal  bar
    during the incident. The judge treated the offence as  an  incident  of
    serious disorder in the street rather than an  unprovoked  attack.  The
    judge also took into account that there  was  a  significant  level  of
    provocation from the  complainant  and  that  the  injuries  the  judge
    specifically stated were not the worst that one might expect  and  that
    they looked worse than they actually were and were " superficial".

153. Having considered the facts of the offence and  recognising  that  this
    was an incident carried out in public by two men fighting and one which
    properly merited an immediate custodial sentence, the Judge  identified
    that there were particular mitigating features which had the effect  of
    reducing its seriousness. They are  summarised  as  follows;  the  high
    level of provocation used against the appellant, the level of  violence
    visited upon the appellant (being under attack with a metal  bar)  that
    any injuries were superficial (and on the basis of plea  the  appellant
    did not cause any injury by the use of a weapon). This was an  incident
    that lasted several seconds and whilst it was an incident  carried  out
    in a public place and therefore one of  public  disorder  having  found
    this limited the aggravating features, he was satisfied that there were
    "many more mitigating features".  Against that  background  and  having
    carried out a careful consideration of the issue, I am persuaded by the
    submissions of Mr Holt and  that  this  offence  did  not  fall  within
    Paragraph 339D (serious reasons for finding a serious  crime)   and  of
    such seriousness to warrant the consequences of excluding someone  from
    humanitarian protection.

154. I therefore now address that issue.



Humanitarian Protection:

155. I now deal with the issue raised of Article 15(c). As the Upper
    Tribunal noted in AA (unattended children) Afghanistan CG at [35], the
    starting point in considering a claim for humanitarian protection under
    Article 15(c) is the decision of the ECJ in Elgafaji (Case C-465/07),
    [2009] 1 WLR 2100. After reviewing the three types of 'serious harm'
    defined in Article 15, the judgment of the ECJ in Elgafaji continued:
           35. In that context, the word 'individual' must be understood as
           covering harm to civilians irrespective of their identity, where
           the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the armed
           conflict taking place assessed by ... the courts of a member
           state to which a decision refusing ... an application [for
           subsidiary protection] is referred, reaches such a high level
           that substantial grounds are shown for believing that a
           civilian, returned to the relevant country or, as the case may
           be, to the relevant region, would, solely on account of his
           presence ... face a real risk of being subject to the serious
           threat referred to in Article 15(c) of the Directive.
156. The personal circumstances of an individual were also addressed by the
    Court:
           39. In that regard the more the applicant is able to show that
           he is specifically affected by reason of fact as particular to
           his personal circumstances, the lower the level of
           indiscriminate violence required for him to be eligible for
           subsidiary protection.
    Notwithstanding the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union,
  the 'minimum  standards'  of  protection  set  out  in  the  Qualification
  Directive continue to find expression in the Immigration Rules:

         339C. A person will be granted humanitarian protection in the
         United Kingdom if the Secretary of State is satisfied that:

           (i) they are in the United Kingdom or have arrived at a port of
           entry in the United Kingdom;
           (ii) they do not qualify as a refugee as defined in regulation 2
           of The Refugee or Person in Need of International Protection
           (Qualification) Regulations 2006;
           (iii) substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the
           person concerned, if returned to the country of return, would
           face a real risk of suffering serious harm and is unable, or,
           owing to such risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the
           protection of that country; and
           (iv) they are not excluded from a grant of humanitarian
         protection.

         339CA. For the purposes of paragraph 339C, serious harm consists
         of:

           (i) the death penalty or execution;
           (ii) unlawful killing;
           (iii) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of
           a person in the country of return; or
           (iv) serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or
           person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of
           international or internal armed conflict.

157. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the  relevant  personal
    characteristics are the appellant's age (33) and  his  lack  of  family
    connections. In addition, whilst ISIL controls no territory as such  in
    Kirkuk there was evidence of it being active in the  areas  surrounding
    Hawija and the Hamrin mountains (see paragraph 252 of SMO) which  is  a
    further factor to support the conclusion that there would be a risk  to
    the appellant under Article 15 (c ).

158. I have considered the issue in the light of the country guidance
    decision of SMO (as cited). At paragraphs 251- 261, the Upper Tribunal
    expressly refers to Kirkuk Governorate and within those paragraphs
    undertakes an assessment of the country materials relevant to that
    area.

159. The conclusion reached at [257] that the level of violence in the
    governorate does not reach the Article 15(c ) threshold and that "we do
    not consider that the level of risk to an ordinary civilian purely on
    account of his presence in Kirkuk,. Or any part of it, is such as to
    cross the Article 15 (c ) threshold. The existence and actions of
    permanently operating attack cells, the coercion brought to bear on
    sections of the rural population by ISIL and other groups (including
    the PMU) are not at a sufficiently high level to cross that threshold
    when considered as a whole."

160. The general conclusions concerning Article 15 ( c) are set out at
    paragraphs [282- 289]. At [285] the Upper Tribunal turned its attention
    to factors affecting Iraq generally, sectarian tension, political
    insecurity and large scale displacement and extensive humanitarian need
    which are inflamed by the Iranian backed PMU which assisted the ISF and
    in the defeat of ISIL.  However whilst noting that the level of threat
    "varies considerably by region",  they concluded that "with one
    exception, however, we do not consider that the risk to an ordinary
    civilian, even in parts of those territories in which ISIL exerts a
    degree of physical and psychological control of the population, is such
    as to engage Article 15 (c ) in the generality of cases. The evidence
    clearly shows that the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising
    the current armed conflict taking place in .... Kirkuk.. is not at such
    a high level that substantial grounds have been shown for believing
    that any civilian return there would be solely on account of his
    presence there face a real risk of threat to his life or person." The
    one exception was said to be the area north of Baji which is not in
    Kirkuk.


161. At [287] the tribunal concluded that they were satisfied that the
    changes that they had detailed above were "well-established and durable
    and that the previous country guidance in AA (Iraq) required revision
    in accordance with the conclusions above."


162. Thus the appellant cannot satisfy the test that there are substantial
    grounds for believing that as a civilian return there he would be
    solely on account of his presence facing a real risk of threat to his
    life or person.


163. Mr Holt submits that in his case he falls within the enhanced risk
    categories.

164. I have therefore considered in light of the case law set out earlier
    in my decision whether the appellant as an individual applicant might
    be to show that he is specifically affected by reasons of factors
    particular to his personal circumstances and therefore applying the
    "sliding scale".


165. At [313]-[314] the Upper Tribunal set out the risk categories as
    follows:


    "313.In summary, we consider that  the  appellants'  proposed  list  of
    seventeen  factors   can   be   somewhat   condensed.    Two   personal
    characteristics are particularly important.   Firstly,  those  with  an
    actual or perceived association with ISIL are likely to be at  enhanced
    risk throughout Iraq.  Secondly, in those areas in which  ISIL  retains
    an active presence, those who have a current personal association  with
    local or national government or the security apparatus are likely to be
    at enhanced risk.


    314.     Other personal characteristics which are capable of being
    relevant, individually, and cumulatively, to the sliding scale analysis
    required by Article 15(c) are as follows:
    (i)            Opposition to or criticism of the GOI, the KRG or local
security actors;
    (ii)          Membership of a  national,  ethnic,  or  religious  group
    which is either in the minority in the area in question, or not  in  de
    facto control of that area;
    (iii)        LGBTI individuals, those not conforming to  Islamic  mores
    and wealthy or Westernised individuals;
    (iv)        Humanitarian or medical staff  and  those  associated  with
    Western organisations or security forces;
    (v)          Women and children without genuine family support;
    (vi)        Individuals with disabilities.


    315.     The impact of any of the personal characteristics  immediately
    above must be carefully assessed against the situation in the  area  to
    which return is contemplated, with particular reference to  the  extent
    of ongoing ISIL activity and the behaviour of the  security  actors  in
    control of that area".


166. Having considered the appellant's personal characteristics, there is
    no evidence before the tribunal that he has any actual or perceived
    association with ISIL nor is it suggested that he has any such
    association. Whilst Mr Holt relies upon his age, it is not been
    demonstrated by any reference to the country materials or the country
    guidance decision that the appellant's age of 33 is such a
    characteristic as to give rise to any relevance in the assessment.
    Similarly, whilst he may be said to be without family support, he does
    not fall within the category of "women and children".


167. In his general submissions, Mr Holt made reference to the appellant
    being at a risk due to his westernisation, and this is referred to as a
    risk factor (see [311]).

168. However that submission was not supported by any reference to any
    relevant characteristics of this particular appellant which give rise
    to him being described as "westernised" beyond the fact of his length
    of residence in the United Kingdom. The appellant still retains his
    cultural and language links to Iraq and the tribunal has not been
    alerted to any particular aspects of his conduct which would
    necessarily be described as "westernised", nor by reference to his
    appearance or demeanour.

169. In the decision of SMO, the Upper Tribunal made reference to section
    3.12 of the EASO report which referred to the PMU enforcing
    "conservative standards on personal appearance". The tribunal recorded
    that there have been reports of women being targeted, including in
    Baghdad, for an Islamic dress but that "we know that there is little
    recent evidence to support a claim that men displaying westernised
    behaviour would be at significantly enhanced risk, even in the formally
    contested areas."

170. Of the characteristics set out above, the potentially relevant one is
    that the appellant is an ethnic Kurd. The Kurds are in a minority in
    Iraq as a whole but the position of Kirkuk is that it is "ethnically
    diverse". Whilst Kurds are in the minority, it does not necessarily
    follow that Kurds will be at a particular risk in that region.
    Furthermore to assume potentially to assume that an ethnic group is at
    a disadvantage because it is statistically in the minority in a
    particular area provides too broad a brush. Mr Holt on behalf of the
    appellant has not direct the tribunal to any country materials to
    support this claim. I consider that what needs to be evaluated is
    whether the appellant is at enhanced risk in Kirkuk as a Kurd, having
    regard to the composition of the area in question, the balance of power
    and the extent of ISIL activity in the area. Mr Holt is not produced
    any evidence in this appeal which comes close to demonstrating that.

171. Consequently it has not been demonstrated by reference to the
    appellant's personal and particular circumstances that he falls within
    any of the enhanced risk categories which would demonstrate that he is
    specifically affected by reasons of factors particular to those
    circumstances thus he has not demonstrated that he is entitled to a
    grant of humanitarian protection under Article 15 (c ).

Article 15(b) / Article 3 of the ECHR:

172. I now turn to the primary submission made on behalf of the appellant
    which relate to Article 15(b) or in the alternative Article 3.

173. In reaching my assessment, I bear in mind that it is for the  appellant
    to establish his claim under Art 3 of the ECHR or under  Art  15(b)  of
    the Qualification Directive. In order to do so, he must establish  that
    there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a  real  risk
    of serious harm on return. That burden and standard of proof applies to
    the factual matters in issue in this appeal.

174. The decision letter relied upon by the respondent is dated 31 July
    2019 and reflects the country guidance and country materials that were
    relevant at the date of the decision. Consequently it does not make any
    reference to the current country guidance decision that I must apply,
    namely SMO.


175. The written submissions of the respondent make no specific reference
    to any parts of the decision in SMO but submits in general terms that
    the decision establishes that there is no general Article 15 (c ) risk
    to the appellant to his home area and that he has not established that
    there are any specific risks that will sustain a claim for asylum. I
    have reached the same conclusion for the reasons that I have set out
    earlier.

176. The written submissions on behalf of the respondent further submit
    that as he retains contact with his family namely N, it is open to him
    to obtain assistance in redocumentation. Nothing further is set out in
    the written submissions nor have I been referred to any particular
    parts of SMO during the oral submissions before the tribunal.

177. I have set out my factual findings above as to the issues of contact
    with family members in Iraq and the issue of documentation. As set out
    the appellant does not have a CSID or passport or any documentation
    relevant to establishing his nationality in the United Kingdom.

178. Applying the country guidance in SMO ,the first issue I am required to
    consider is whether the appellant could obtain the relevant
    documentation ( that is a CSID) while in the UK or from Baghdad (if
    returned), either himself or with the assistance of his family.

179. The relevant part of the headnote reads as follows:

    C.    CIVIL STATUS IDENTITY DOCUMENTATION

    11.    The CSID is being replaced with a new biometric  Iraqi  National
        Identity Card - the INID.  As a general matter, it is necessary  for
        an individual to have one of these two documents in  order  to  live
        and travel within Iraq without encountering treatment or  conditions
        which are contrary to Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the  checkpoints  in
        the country are manned by Shia militia who are not controlled by the
        GOI and are unlikely to permit an individual without a  CSID  or  an
        INID  to  pass.   A  valid  Iraqi  passport  is  not  recognised  as
        acceptable proof of identity for internal travel.

    12.    A Laissez Passer will be of no assistance in the  absence  of  a
        CSID or an INID; it is confiscated upon arrival and is not,  in  any
        event,  a  recognised  identity  document.   There  is  insufficient
        evidence to show that returnees are  issued  with  a  'certification
        letter' at Baghdad Airport, or to show that any such document  would
        be recognised internally as acceptable proof of identity.

    13.    Notwithstanding the phased transition to the INID  within  Iraq,
        replacement  CSIDs   remain   available   through   Iraqi   Consular
        facilities.   Whether  an  individual  will  be  able  to  obtain  a
        replacement CSID whilst in the UK depends on the documents available
        and, critically, the availability of the volume and  page  reference
        of the entry in the Family Book in Iraq, which system  continues  to
        underpin the Civil Status Identity process.  Given the importance of
        that  information,  most  Iraqi  citizens  will  recall   it.   That
        information may also be obtained from family members, although it is
        necessary to consider whether such relatives are on the father's  or
        the mother's side because the registration system is patrilineal.

    14.    Once in Iraq, it remains the case that an individual is expected
        to attend their local CSA office in order to  obtain  a  replacement
        document.  All CSA offices have now re-opened, although  the  extent
        to which records have been destroyed by the conflict  with  ISIL  is
        unclear and is likely to vary significantly depending on the  extent
        and intensity of the conflict in the area in question.

    15.    An individual returnee who is not from Baghdad is not likely  to
        be able to obtain a replacement document there,  and  certainly  not
        within a reasonable time.   Neither  the  Central  Archive  nor  the
        assistance facilities for IDPs are likely  to  render  documentation
        assistance to an undocumented returnee.

    16.    The likelihood of obtaining a replacement identity  document  by
        the use of a proxy, whether from the UK or on return  to  Iraq,  has
        reduced due to the introduction of the INID  system.   In  order  to
        obtain an INID, an individual must attend their local CSA office  in
        person to enrol their biometrics, including  fingerprints  and  iris
        scans.  The CSA offices in which INID terminals have been  installed
        are unlikely - as a result of the phased  replacement  of  the  CSID
        system - to issue a CSID, whether to an individual in person or to a
        proxy.   The reducing number of CSA offices in which INID  terminals
        have not been installed will continue to issue CSIDs to  individuals
        and their proxies upon production of the necessary information.



180. I am satisfied that it has not been  demonstrated  that  the  appellant
    would be able to obtain the relevant documentation from the embassy  in
    London.

181. Dr. Fatah's evidence  in SMO, which post-dates AAH,  records  at  (para
    366):    Dr Fatah did not believe that a CSID could  be  obtained  from
    abroad any more,  since it had been replaced by the  INID.   At  [968]-
    [980], however, he described  how a CSID could have  been  obtained  in
    the past from an embassy.

182. In that regard, both advocates relied upon paras 2.6.15 and  2.6.16  of
    the CPIN (June 2020) which is in the following terms:

    " 2.6.15 Since SMO was promulgated in December 2019 further information
    regarding the issuance of CSIDs in the UK has been obtained by the Home
    Office in April 2020 [see Annex I]. When asked to describe the  process
    of obtaining a CSID from  the  Iraqi  Embassy  in  London  the  Returns
    Logistics department stated:

    'CSID cards are being phased out and replaced by  INID  (Iraq  National
    Identification) cards. It is not currently possible  to  apply  for  an
    INID card outside of Iraq. As a result, the Iraqi embassy in London are
    advising their nationals in the UK to apply instead for a 'Registration
    Document (1957)' which they can use to apply for other  documents  such
    as passports or an INID card once they have returned to Iraq.

    'The  registration  document  (1957)  must  be  applied  for   on   the
    applicant's behalf by a nominated representative in Iraq. In  order  to
    start the application, the  individual  requiring  documentation  would
    normally provide at least one copy of a national identity document [see
    paragraph 2.6.24 for list of national identity documents] and  complete
    a power of attorney (to nominate a representative in Iraq) at the Iraqi
    embassy along with the embassy issued application forms. If  they  have
    no copies of identity documents they also  would  need  to  complete  a
    British power of attorney validated by  the  FCO  and  provide  parents
    names, place and date of birth to  their  nominated  representative  in
    Iraq.'

    'Once issued the nominated representative will  send  the  registration
    document (1957) to the applicant in  the  UK.  The  process  takes  1-2
    months.'

    'The HO cannot apply for documentation other than  Laissez  Passers  on
    someone's behalf but the embassy is willing to  check  to  see  if  the
    individual already holds documents and provide copies if necessary.'

    2.6.16 Based on the above information, it is highly  unlikely  that  an
    individual would be able to obtain a CSID from the Iraqi Embassy  while
    in the UK. Instead a person would need  to  apply  for  a  registration
    document (1957) and would then apply for an INID upon return  to  their
    local CSA office in Iraq."

183. It is therefore common ground that the appellant will not  be  able  to
    apply for or obtain a CSID in the UK. The alternative  route  suggested
    in the CPIN is an application for a "1957 document".

184. In light of the factual finding that I have  made  that  the  appellant
    has been in the UK since 2008 and in the light of the evidence  given,,
    I am satisfied that he does not recall the details from the family book
    which might assist him or family  members  in  Iraq  in  obtaining  any
    documentation. I am  prepared  to  accept  that  the  appellant  cannot
    generally recall this information and he was  not  challenged  on  this
    point. As I have set out, the reasoning set out in SMO  which  appeared
    to underpin the conclusion that most Iraqi  citizens  will  recall  the
    reference in the family book, has been set aside by consent.

185. In those circumstances the appellant has no  information  himself  that
    would assist in obtaining the requisite documentation. I have therefore
    considered whether the information can be obtained from  his  relatives
    in Iraq. I have set out my findings of fact that the  earlier  findings
    of Judge Kelly concerning contact with his stepsister N have  not  been
    undermined. On the evidence presented, the appellant has  been  brought
    up by his stepsister. I have also found that it  is  reasonably  likely
    that he is not in contact with his stepsiblings for the reasons that  I
    have given.

186. It has  not  been  explained  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  how  the
    appellant's stepsister, even if they are in contact, would be  able  to
    obtain the documents or obtain assistance from  the  authorities  given
    her position as a woman.

187. Nor has it been explained, even if it were right to conclude  that  the
    document known as a "1957 document" , how that document could  be  used
    once in Iraq to travel internally. The document appears to  be  limited
    to enabling the issue of a laissez passï¿½ for internal travel.

188. Mr Holt has submitted that the appellant as a former resident  of  Iraq
    as opposed to the IKR, will be returned  to  Baghdad.  Mr  Diwnycz  has
    confirmed that  the  position  of  the  respondent  is  that  for  this
    appellant the only destination for  an  enforced  return  would  be  to
    Baghdad. There is no proposal in his case that he would be returned  to
    the IKR.

189. I have therefore had to consider the circumstances  for  the  appellant
    on return without a CSID and therefore at risk of treatment  in  breach
    of Article 3 if he seeks to travel from Baghdad. In this context, it is
    common ground that he would arrive without any form  of  documentation,
    having not been able to obtain it in the United Kingdom. In  the  event
    that he remains in contact with his stepsister and on  the  basis  that
    she as a sole woman would be able to travel from Kirkuk to  Baghdad,  I
    have considered the possibility of whether she could meet him there and
    provide assistance.

190. Mr Holt submits that this  is  not  possible  and  that  the  realistic
    position for the appellant without any documentation is that  he  would
    remain at the airport and not be able to travel to Baghdad  as  such  a
    journey  would  entail  him  passing   through   several   checkpoints.
    Furthermore, he submits even if  his  stepsister  could  obtain  a  new
    document ( his previous documents  having been  lost)to  bring  to  the
    appellant in  Baghdad  at  the  airport,  that  would  not  assist  the
    appellant in light of the evidence in SMO. Her ability to do so depends
    on whether the appellant is from an area where CSID's are still  issued
    or whether the alternative system referred to in SMO, the INID has  now
    been rolled out and in operation which is an entirely different  system
    that requires his attendance in person.

191. I have considered paragraph [431] of SMO. It  is  plain  that  the  CSA
    office in Kirkuk no longer operates the system whereby a CSID  will  be
    provided. It has an INID terminal and there is  no  evidence  that  the
    authorities will be willing to issue a CSID to the appellant through  a
    proxy. It must follow that in the event that he  has  no  access  to  a
    CSID, and that he is not able to obtain a replacement in the UK,  I  am
    satisfied that as the Upper Tribunal said in SMO, his  return  to  Iraq
    would be in breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.

192. I have not been provided to any evidence on behalf  of  the  respondent
    to undermine that conclusion in SMO.  As  the  civil  Registry  in  the
    appellant's home area has rolled out the new system which  operates  an
    INID terminal, in order to obtain the requisite document,  which  is  a
    biometric document, it will be necessary for the  appellant  to  attend
    that office in person to provide those biometric details.

193. As to obtaining a CSID from Baghdad, an individual returnee who is  not
    from Baghdad, which is the position of this appellant, is not likely to
    be able to obtain a replacement document or to do so  in  a  reasonable
    time. The central archive and the facilities for IDP's are  not  likely
    to provide assistance for an undocumented returnee. The appellant would
    not be able to board a domestic flight beyond Baghdad  or  to  the  IKR
    without either a CSID or INID or invalid passport.

194.  Given that the enforced route of return is to  Baghdad,  and  that  in
    light of the assessment he would not  be  able  to  leave  the  airport
    without such document, it follows that the appellant will be in Baghdad
    with no form of support and thus the risk of destitution applies.  This
    is the factual assessment made by the Secretary of State in the country
    guidance decisions when addressing Article 15 (b).

195. I accept the submission made by Mr Holt that the material  demonstrates
    that the appellant would not be able to leave the  airport  at  Baghdad
    without a CSID or valid INID. The Upper Tribunal recorded the  evidence
    which they describe as "uncontested" that a failure to produce  a  CSID
    or, in the environs of the airport a valid  passport,  will  be  likely
    result in detention until the authorities  could  be  satisfied  of  an
    individual's identity.

196. It cannot be  properly  said  that  the  appellant  could  relocate  to
    Baghdad, given that he is not likely to be documented and therefore the
    guidance in SMO (applying the former guidance in AA (Iraq) (set out  in
    annex A to SMO) does not apply to the appellant. Furthermore, paragraph
    414 of SMO refers to the circumstances  that  in  order  to  reside  in
    Baghdad, an individual from the formally contested areas  will  require
    security clearance and "two sponsors from the  neighbourhood  in  which
    they intend to reside as well  as  a  support  letter  from  the  local
    Mokhtar". That has not been explained any further by the respondent and
    in any event the likelihood of obtaining a sponsor residence in Baghdad
    would  be  dependent  again  on  the  individual  being   "documented".
    Furthermore, in the preceding country  guidance  case  of   AAH  (Iraqi
    Kurds) [2018] UKUT 212 it was held at paragraph 98 as  an  ethnic  Kurd
    without a  CSID and no family members in Baghdad could  not  reasonably
    be expected to relocate there. I do not consider that the  position  is
    changed from SMO although I would accept that a slightly different list
    of factors are set out.

197. Drawing  together  all  of  those  factors,  it  must  follow  from  my
    reasoning  that  the   appellant   does   not   have   Iraqi   identity
    documentation and will not be able to re- document in the UK or  within
    a reasonable  time  upon  return  to  Iraq  and  without  the  relevant
    documentation, country background information and the country  guidance
    decisions make it plain, and is accepted by the respondent  before  me,
    the appellant would be at risk of serious harm in Iraq.

198. The decision of Judge Reid made it plain that  the  appellant  had  not
    demonstrated a risk of persecution in Iraq based on a Convention reason
    and nor has one properly been  evidenced  during  the  course  of  this
    hearing. Thus the appellant succeeds on  the  basis  that  he  will  be
    unable to reside in Iraq without being at a real risk of  serious  harm
    for reasons relating to the absence of the identity documentation. Thus
    to return the appellant to Iraq would be in breach of Article 3 of  the
    ECHR and Article 15 (b) as set out in the immigration rules.

199. Given that assessment, it is not necessary to consider  Article  8  and
    therefore  the  appellant  has  demonstrated  that  an   exception   to
    deportation applies in his case on the basis set out above.

Decision:

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of  an  error
on a point of law and the decision is set aside; the appeal  is  re-made  as
follows: the appeal is allowed on humanitarian protection  grounds  (Article
15 (b) and under  the  Immigration  Rules,  and    human  rights  grounds  (
Article 3).

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or his family members. This direction  applies  both
to the Appellant and  to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
