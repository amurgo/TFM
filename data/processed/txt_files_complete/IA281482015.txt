For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton (Senior Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Imtiyaz Khan against the decision of the First-
       tier Tribunal of 13 October  2016,  dismissing  his  appeal  brought
       against the decision to refuse his application for an  extension  of
       stay as a student, of 23 July 2015.


    2. The immigration history supplied  by  the  Respondent  is  that  the
       Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 22  December  2009  and  was
       granted leave until 3 May 2012 as a Tier 4 student, for the  purpose
       of studying at the BC College of North West London.  He applied  for
       further leave to study at Stanfords College.  That  application  was
       originally refused and an  appeal  brought  against  that  decision,
       itself determined on 25 September 2012, requiring the  Secretary  of
       State to retake the decision having previously unlawfully combined a
       decision on the variation application with a decision to set removal
       directions as an overstayer. There was then a lengthy  delay  whilst
       the Home Office reconsidered  the  case,  leading  to  the  decision
       giving rise to the present  appeal,  which  is  accordingly  brought
       under the older "saved" provisions of  the  Nationality  Immigration
       and Asylum Act 2002.


    3. The application was refused because the Appellant


       a) Had studied with a Sponsor other than that with respect to which
          his visa had been authorised, contrary to section 50 of the
          Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009;
       b) Had not supplied a valid Certificate of Acceptance for Studies.


    4. The Appellant's evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that
       that he originally entered the UK in  2009  to  study  for  an  ACCA
       qualification, at BC College of North West London (BCCNWL).  However
       when he sought to commence studies in January 2012, he learned  that
       the institution had closed down. He did not report the fraud by  the
       BCCNWL to the police or the Home Office, although he had lost ï¿½2,800
       in fees.


    5. He was advised by friends  that  the  London  School  of  Management
       Education (LSEM) was a suitable alternative  Sponsor,  and  enrolled
       with LSEM in January 2012, with a view to studying for a Diploma  in
       Business Management, and was told by a staff member there  that  the
       college would advise the  Home  Office  of  his  change  of  Sponsor
       without the need for any further application from himself.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed  his  appeal.  It  considered  his
       explanation for switching college to lack credibility: he was unable
       to name the staff member who allegedly misdirected him, and had  not
       taken the trouble to have the asserted advice put into written form.
       He referred in oral evidence to friends who had  run  into  problems
       with their own student status in the UK  and  so  clearly  moved  in
       circles where the Home Office system was understood;  he  had  known
       how to consult the Home Office website in order to see  whether  his
       college retained its licence. In these circumstances he  had  failed
       to comply with a condition of his leave, and so  fell  foul  of  the
       general refusal reasons.


    7. The First-tier Tribunal addressed the argument  that  the  Appellant
       had been unlawfully disadvantaged by the Home Office failure to give
       him the benefit of the customary  60  days'  grace  to  find  a  new
       Sponsor, that being a policy that should have been  applied  in  his
       favour when the decision maker discovered that Stanfords College was
       no longer an authorised Sponsor. It concluded that there would  have
       been no advantage to the Appellant in such a grant of  leave,  given
       the loss of Stanfords' licence.


    8. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 25 April 2017, on
       a single ground, viz that the refusal  of  the  application  without
       giving the Appellant an opportunity  to  find  another  Sponsor  was
       procedurally unfair. In so doing  Judge  Chapman  expressly  refused
       permission to appeal to argue that the approach below to credibility
       and to the alleged breach of conditions was unlawful.


    9. Before me Mr Aslam argued that the failure to apply the "sixty days'
       grace" policy was so unfair as to cloud the decision on  the  appeal
       overall. The First-tier Tribunal had clearly thought that the breach
       of conditions resulted in a mandatory refusal  of  his  application,
       and so had not considered whether it was appropriately held  against
       the Appellant as a matter of discretion.


   10. For the Respondent, Mr Norton submitted that the  failure  to  apply
       the guidance was not a material error of law: the Appellant had  not
       materially suffered given he had completed his studies by  the  time
       his application fell to be considered,  and  anyway  the  breach  of
       conditions would inevitably have doomed  his  application  once  his
       explanation for how he came to  change  Sponsor  without  permission
       from the Home Office was rejected.


Findings and reasons


11. The only ground of  appeal  on  which  permission  to  appeal  has  been
   granted asserts  that  the  decision  making  process  was  unfair.  The
   relevant Home  Office  Guidance  around  the  time  of  the  Appellant's
   application in relation to applications for leave to  remain  under  the
   Tier 4 Student category provides as follows:


      "Where the applicant was assigned a CAS by  the  sponsor  before  they
      were removed from the sponsor register, the  applicant  can  apply  to
      extend their leave. ...
      2. Where the application does not meet the requirements, refuse it.
      3. Where it does meet the requirements, put it on hold. ...
      5. If the student's  application  has  been  held  and  the  sponsor's
      licence is revoked, and the student has been a bona fide  student  and
      did not participate in the practices which led to the revocation,  the
      options for action depend on the leave that they have:
      If they still have at least 60 days permission to stay remaining,  you
      must curtail their leave so that it will expire once the period of  60
      days has run out. During this 60 days they can seek a new CAS  from  a
      different sponsor and  either  vary  their  application,  make  a  new
      application or leave the UK. If their  permission  to  stay  runs  out
      whilst they are waiting for a decision on their application  you  must
      delay the refusal of their application for 60 days to  allow  them  to
      seek a new CAS from a different sponsor and vary their leave."


12. Accordingly it is clear that  the  decision  maker  who  considered  his
   application in 2015 should have appreciated that, given the  Appellant's
   leave had run out whilst he awaited a decision on the application,  that
   he should have been given a further  opportunity  to  find  a  different
   sponsor. The  policy  applies  to  a  bona  fide  student  who  did  not
   participate in the practices which led to the revocation.  There  is  no
   suggestion that the Appellant did not genuinely intend to study in  this
   country or that he was in any way associated with the  reasons  for  the
   College's loss of licence.


13. The First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  in  failing  to  find  that  this
   policy was applicable and that there was  no  relevant  exception  which
   might have deprived the Appellant of its benefit. However,  that  leaves
   the question as to whether the error was material.


14. This leads on to the other reason why  the  application  was  originally
   refused, the question of the Appellant's alleged breach  of  conditions.
   Section 3(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1971 was amended by section 50 of
   the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009  to  alter   the
   conditions that may be imposed on limited leave to enter  or  remain  in
   the United  Kingdom  to  specifically  permit  a  condition  restricting
   studies in the United Kingdom.


15. Rule 245ZY(c)(iv) provides for the period and conditions of  leave  that
   are to be granted to a Tier 4 student, in particular that the conditions
   include  one  of  "no  study"  except  at  the  institution   that   the
   Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies Checking Service or  visa  letter
   records as the migrant's Sponsor. The general refusal reasons  then  set
   out Rule 322(3) amongst the grounds upon which leave  to  remain  should
   normally be refused: "failure to comply with any conditions attached  to
   the grant of leave to enter or remain".


16. The Appellant's claim to the First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  discretion
   should  have  been  exercised  in  his  favour  because  the  breach  of
   conditions was innocent: he had been misled by defective advice from  an
   ostensibly reliable source.  However,  the  Judge  who  heard  his  oral
   evidence rejected the veracity of that explanation, on the basis that he
   moved in student circles who could be expected to be well familiar  with
   the need to apply to the Home  Office  if  changing  Sponsor.  There  is
   nothing irrational or otherwise unlawful  in  that  reasoning.  In  fact
   permission to appeal was refused on this point, but it seems  fairer  to
   the Appellant to address it, given that his case is now before the Upper
   Tribunal.


17. In these circumstances, I do not consider that the error  of  law  below
   was a material one. The Appellant's appeal was doomed to fail  once  his
   explanation as to the circumstances behind his breach of conditions  was
   rejected. The reality is that he has now spent nearly eight years in the
   United Kingdom on the basis of two relatively short proposed courses  of
   study, and in  that  period  has  failed  to  find  a  Sponsor  that  is
   acceptable to the Home Office.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  contain  a  material
    error of law.
    The appeal is dismissed.
