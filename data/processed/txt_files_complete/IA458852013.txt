Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms N Bustani, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  However, for the sake of clarity, I shall use  the  titles
    by which the parties were known before the First-tier Tribunal with the
    Secretary of State referred to as "the respondent" and Mr Khodabocus as
    "the appellant".

 2. No application for anonymity has been made in these proceedings and  no
    grounds for such an order were put before me today.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Mauritius born on 6 January 1978.

 4. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom  on  7  August  2006  as  a
    visitor for six months sponsored by his current wife with whom  he  has
    lived since his arrival  into  the  United  Kingdom.   His  wife  is  a
    naturalised British citizen and the appellant and his wife underwent  a
    "Nikah" marriage on 14 September 2006 at the Central Mosque  of  Brent.
    They were subsequently married in a civil marriage at Haringey Registry
    Office on 14 May 2012.

 5. On 17 May 2012 the appellant's solicitors applied  on  his  behalf  for
    leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a  dependent  spouse.   The
    application was refused on 28 January 2013 with  no  right  of  appeal.
    Thereafter judicial review proceedings  were  issued  and  subsequently
    withdrawn on the basis that the respondent had agreed to reconsider the
    application and make an immigration  decision  which  would  attract  a
    right of appeal.  Accordingly a further decision dated 24 October  2013
    was  made  by  the  respondent  which  again  refused  the  appellant's
    application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom.   The  refusal
    letter of 24 October 2013 stated that the application was  reconsidered
    under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights taking  into
    account Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009
    and the Immigration Rules put in place on 9 July  2012  under  Appendix
    FM.  The appellant  appealed  against  the  respondent's  decision  and
    following a hearing on 27 June 2014 in  a  decision  promulgated  on  3
    November 2014 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  I  Ross  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal.

 6. At that hearing it was accepted by both parties  that  the  application
    ought to have been considered only under the Immigration Rules in force
    as at 8 July 2012 and under Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human  Rights  without  reference  to  Appendix  FM,  given  that   the
    application was made on 17 May 2012 prior to the  introduction  of  the
    new Immigration Rules on  9  July  2012.   It  was  accepted  that  the
    appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules then  in  force
    as he had no leave to remain in the United Kingdom at the time  of  the
    application.  His wife gave evidence in support of his appeal  and  her
    undisputed evidence was to the effect that she is a naturalised British
    citizen who has lived in the United Kingdom since 2002 and works as  an
    assistant management accountant earning ï¿½31,000 per year.  She was,  at
    the date of hearing, undergoing fertility treatment to  have  children.
    The nub of the judge's findings  and  reasoning  can  be  gleaned  from
    paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 of his decision which state:-

         "14. In deciding whether the interference is proportionate, I  take
             into account the authority of Beoku-Betts v SSHD  [2008]  UKHL
             39 and conclude that the direct impact on other family members
             can be considered in an appeal  under  Article  8  against  an
             immigration decision.  The right to  respect  for  the  family
             life of one necessarily encompasses the right to  respect  for
             the family life of  others  with  whom  that  family  life  is
             enjoyed.  In considering the impact on the appellant's wife, I
             accept that the decision will result in her living apart  from
             the  appellant  whilst  her  application  is  progressed  from
             Mauritius since I find that there to be compelling reasons why
             she could not join the appellant in Mauritius, those being her
             life  as  British  Citizen  and  her  job  and  her  fertility
             treatment.  I find that the effect on  her  of  the  appellant
             having to return  to  Mauritius  is  sufficiently  serious  to
             outweigh the public interest to maintain effective immigration
             control.

          15. I have also taken into account Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40
             and appreciate that it is not necessarily unlawful to  require
             an Appellant who relied on a human rights ground to return  to
             their country of origin  to  make  an  application  for  entry
             clearance.  The rationale behind the  Home  Office  policy  of
             routinely requiring Appellants to apply  from  abroad  was  to
             deter others from  entering  without  entry  clearance.   This
             could be a legitimate objective and in certain cases could  be
             the  right  course  of  action,   but   only   when   relevant
             considerations in the particular  case  made  it  so.   In  an
             Article 8 family case the prospective  length  and  degree  of
             family disruption  involved  in  going  abroad  for  an  entry
             clearance certificate will always be a highly relevant  factor
             in the  assessment  of  proportionality.   Only  comparatively
             rarely, certainly in family cases involving  children,  should
             an Article 8 appeal be dismissed on the basis that it would be
             proportionate and more appropriate for the Appellant to  apply
             for leave from abroad.  Whilst there are no children  involved
             in this appeal, I take into account that the appellant and his
             wife have been together for some 8 years.

          16. I have carefully considered the Upper  Tribunal  Judgment  of:
             Hayat (nature of Chikwamba  principle)  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT
             00444 (IAC).

             "The significance of Chikwamba,  however,  is  to  make  plain
             that, where the only matter weighing on the respondent's  side
             of the balance is the public policy of requiring a  person  to
             apply under the rules from abroad, that  legitimate  objective
             will  usually  be  outweighed  by  factors  resting   on   the
             appellant's side of the balance".

             I find that the factors present on the side of  the  appellant
             and his wife as set out above, outweigh the only matter on the
             respondent's side which is the requirement to apply for  leave
             from abroad."

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  P
    J M Hollingworth on 17 December 2014.  His ground for so doing was:-

         "An arguable error of law has arisen in relation to the  extent  of
         the application of the criteria set out in Section 117."

 8. Thus the appeal came before me.

 9. Mr Tufan relied on the two grounds seeking permission to  appeal.   The
    first asserts that the judge materially misdirected himself in carrying
    out the balancing exercise following the authority of Hayat (Nature  of
    Chikwamba principle) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00444 (IAC).   The  appellant
    was an overstayer and unable to comply with the relevant provisions  of
    the  Immigration  Rules  but  moreover  Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 should  have  been  considered  by  the
    judge and had regard to.  Secondly Mr Tufan submitted that the decision
    to refuse the appellant's application and the requirement  for  him  to
    make a proper application for entry clearance does  not  represent,  as
    found by the judge, a disproportionate breach with rights protected  by
    Article 8.

10. Ms Bustani argued that permission to appeal had only have been  granted
    in respect of the first of the first of the two grounds and  that  from
    28 July 2014 Section 19 of the Immigration Act  2014  is  brought  into
    force amending the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  by
    introducing a new Part 5A which contains Section 117.  As the  decision
    had been written by Judge Ross on 30 June 2014 there is a question mark
    as to whether he had in any event erred in  relation  to  Section  117.
    The authority of Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40  was  in  itself  fact
    sensitive.  There is no error of law within Judge Ross's decision as he
    has looked at all competing factors on either side of the balance  when
    giving consideration to Article 8.  The fact that the appellant  is  an
    overstayer is but one factor  alone.   The  respondent  is  effectively
    endeavouring to secure a "second bite  of  the  cherry"  and  there  is
    within the decision no error.

11. The first thing to note is the applicable dates here.  The hearing took
    place at Taylor House on 27 June 2014 and the judge dated his  decision
    30 June 2014.  However, for reasons that the  Tribunal  file  does  not
    disclose it was not until 3 November of that year that the decision was
    promulgated.

12. The statutory provisions inserted by Section 19 of the Immigration  Act
    2014 applied to all appeals heard on or after 28 July 2014 irrespective
    of when the application or immigration decision was made.

13. As this appeal was heard on 27 June 2014 and prior to 28 July 2014  the
    judge can hardly be criticised for  giving  no  weight  to  the  issues
    referred to within Part 5A and particularly Section 117B(1).

14. Whilst the second ground was not subject to permission being granted it
    was nonetheless put forward by the respondent and not  overtly  refused
    in the grant of permission  of  Judge  P  J  M  Hollingworth.   I  have
    therefore considered it.  In short I find this  amounts  to  a  dispute
    with the judge's reasoning and findings which are legally adequate  and
    which take proper account of the material that fell to  be  considered.
    There certainly appears to be no omission in relation  to  any  of  the
    factors  requiring  weighing  in  the  balance  when  looking  at   the
    proportionality test within Article 8.  I appreciate  that  it  can  be
    argued the judge's decision was a generous one but that in itself  does
    not mean that he has materially erred.

15. The judge was entitled to find that the appellant's  Article  8  rights
    would be breached by being returned to his country of origin and having
    weighed everything  in  the  balance  I  conclude  the  second  of  the
    respondent's appeal grounds amounts to a disagreement with findings and
    reasonings which, as I say, are legally adequate and which take  proper
    account of the material which fell to be considered.

Conclusions

16. The making of the decision by the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

17. I do not set aside the decision.
