Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr AA Shamim



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. In this determination I will refer to the  parties  by  the  style  in
      which they appeared before the First-Tier Tribunal.

   2. The appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan born  12  July  1990.   He
      made application for entry clearance to join his wife  in  the  United
      Kingdom.  His wife has leave to remain  as  a  domestic  worker.   The
      application was refused and he appealed  that  decision.   His  appeal
      came before Judge  of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  Hussain  sitting  at
      Richmond on 15 April 2014.  The appellant's sponsor attended and  gave
      evidence.  The respondent was represented by a Presenting Officer.  In
      a determination promulgated on 29 May 2014 the appellant's appeal  was
      allowed.

   3. The respondent sought leave to  appeal  that  decision.   The  grounds
      allege a material error in that the judge had failed to deal  with  an
      issue that had been specifically raised in the decision notice.   This
      included comment that no evidence had been provided regarding  contact
      for 2ï¿½ years between the parties to the marriage.

   4. In granting leave to appeal another judge of the  First-Tier  Tribunal
      gave this as a reason:

         "It is arguable that the judge erred in failing address  (sic)  the
      sponsor's failure to visit the appellant for some two and  half  years
      before the making of the application.  This was raised in the decision
      as a reason for the refusal".


   5. Hence the matter came before me in the Upper Tribunal.

   6. Mr Deller made an oral submission in support of  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officers challenge.  In fact there was no challenge to the question of
      accommodation.   This  is  dealt  with   in   paragraph   8   of   the
      determination.  Mr Deller quite rightly drew my attention to the  fact
      there was evidence that the sponsor had  gone  to  Pakistan  and  with
      regard to previous applications and a joint account.  Very credibly Mr
      Deller suggested that the judge had done enough in  the  determination
      to avoid error.

   7. Mr Shamim had nothing to add other than that he supported the  judge's
      determination.

   8. For the reasons that now follow, I indicated that I was dismissing the
      Entry  Clearance  Officer's  appeal.   There  was  no  material  error
      contained within the determination.

   9. The main challenge to Judge Hussain's conclusion are  with  regard  to
      contact enjoyed between the appellant  and  his  wife  since  November
      2010.  It is said that as this issue had  been  raised  by  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer it failed to be determined by the judge and he would
      be in error if he did not do so.

  10. In fact the judge dealt with all issues that had been  raised  by  the
      parties.  IN paragraph 10 the judge says this:

         "I am also at a loss to understand how the  respondent  could  have
      overlooked evidence in his own bundle that  showed  that  his  sponsor
      travelled to Pakistan on 2 May 2013 until  2  July  that  year.   This
      evidence  is  clearly  consistent  with  there  being   a   subsisting
      marriage..."

  11. The judge clearly addressed all issues including the  requirements  of
      the Immigration Rules.  He made findings that were  entirely  open  to
      him and no error of law exists within the determination.

  12. The appeal  lodged  on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  is
      accordingly dismissed.

  13. No application was before me in respect of anonymity  and  I  make  no
      direction in respect thereof.
