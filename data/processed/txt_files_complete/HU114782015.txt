Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Woodhouse, of Counsel, instructed by SH & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan, who  seeks  to  challenge  the
    decision of the Secretary of State dated 26th  October  2015,  refusing
    her application for entry clearance as a partner under Appendix FM.
2.   It was not in dispute that the appellant and sponsor were in a  genuine
    relationship.  The sponsor went to Pakistan in 2014 to get married  and
    returned in February 2015.  He submitted the application for settlement
    on 13th July 2015.

3.   The application was refused  because  the  requisite  documentation  to
    show income had not been provided, namely bank statements for a  twelve
    month period. In this case bank statements from March 2015 to July 2015
    were submitted.  Given that the sponsor resided in  Pakistan  for  some
    ten months it is  understandable  that  he  would  have  difficulty  in
    obtaining the requisite documentation.

4.   Essentially the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was based  upon
    the failure to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

5.   The appellant sought to appeal against that decision on the basis  that
    the decision was one which infringed her basic human rights.

6.   Thus the matter came before the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  hearing  on
    20th February 2017.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Phull heard  the  appeal
    and dismissed it under  human rights grounds and Article 8 of the ECHR.

7.   The appellant seeks to challenge that decision and permission to do  so
    was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gibb by reason of paragraph  D
    of Appendix FM (relating to evidential flexibility/documents missing in
    sequence  and   failing   to   consider   the   wider   assessment   of
    proportionality).

8.   Thus the matter comes before me to determine whether there is indeed  a
    material error.

9.   As I have indicated the jurisdiction for the Tribunal to entertain  the
    appeal at all lies, not in the challenge to  the  substantive  decision
    under the Immigration Rules, but in a failure to give due regard to the
    appellant's best interests and her human rights.

10.  In a very  senses that proportionality assessment has been  clouded  by
    a concern whether or not the documents  were  sufficient  to  meet  the
    Immigration Rules, or whether Appendix D or Appendix FM-SE should  have
    been brought into effect by the respondent and/or Judge.

11.  It is of course open to a Judge, in considering Article 8, to  look  at
    the broader aspect of matters outside of the strict  interpretation  of
    the Immigration Rules.  It seems to me that the Judge has been somewhat
    reluctant to do so.  Even in the assessment of Article 8,  rather  than
    the substantive merits of the Immigration Rules (paragraphs 24 and 26),
    the issue of failure to provide bank statements raises  its  head  time
    and again.

12.  The reality of the matter is that  the  sponsor  is  in  receipt  of  a
    carer's allowance of �62.10  per  week.   That  being  so,  the  strict
    requirement of having income of �18,600 per annum did not apply to him.
     All he had to show is that, excluding  accommodation,  he  has  income
    that is equivalent to  the  income  support  for  a  husband  and  wife
    calculated at some �87.50 per week. Thus income at a very modest level.

13.  The sponsor is self-employed in the United Kingdom  as  a  taxi  driver
    and it is not seriously disputed that he has earned the  modest  amount
    that is needed over and above the allowance to satisfy the  Rules.   As
    Mr Woodhouse indicated in  his  submissions  to  me,  there  was  ample
    material apart from the bank statements  to  show  the  nature  of  the
    earnings that he had.  The difficulty in practical terms was of  course
    that he had been some ten months in Pakistan and had not  been  earning
    during that period.  Generally it  could  be  seen  from  the  evidence
    submitted, that he had the modest amount that was  required,  namely  a
    few thousand pounds a year over his allowance.

14.  The Judge correctly identified the case of MM v Secretary of State  for
    the  Home  Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  (paragraph  20  of   the
    determination).  The  Judge  recognised  that  the  Rules  were  not  a
    complete code and as such did not fully address the private and  family
    life issues.  It  was  necessary  to  conduct  a  full  proportionality
    exercise before coming to a conclusion.  Thus it would have  been  open
    to the Judge, having looked at all the material, to have been satisfied
    that, notwithstanding the technicalities of the Immigration Rules, that
    the financial requirements were met.  That would be an important matter
    in favour of the appellant calling perhaps for some consideration as to
    why it was proportionate therefore under human rights  to  exclude  her
    from the jurisdiction.

15.  However, that having been said, it is by no means an easy  exercise  to
    be undertaken because clearly the jurisprudence requires that, if human
    rights are raised outside of the Rules, there has to be some compelling
    and compassionate circumstances that arise to require  entry  clearance
    to be given.  In this case Mr Woodhouse submits that  the  sponsor  was
    the carer of  his  nephew  and  that  this  element  should  have  been
    considered by the Judge.  It seems to me that the matter was considered
    fairly in paragraph 26 of the determination.  The reality was  that  it
    could not be said that the child was totally dependent upon the sponsor
    and there was no evidence to that effect in  any  event.   Clearly  the
    child had been looked after by his own family and mother  and  extended
    family while the sponsor was ten  months  in  Pakistan.   It  was  also
    difficult to perhaps understand what was the urgency of the application
    given that the appellant lived in Pakistan, was married there and  that
    family  life  for  nine  months  shortly  before  the  application  was
    conducted in Pakistan and not in  the  United  Kingdom.   It  would  be
    difficult to  argue  on  that  basis  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles or very significant obstacles to family life being  conducted
    in Pakistan.   It  is  perhaps  difficult  to  argue  that  there  were
    compelling circumstances that required entry clearance when most of the
    family life had been conducted  in  Pakistan.   Mr  Mills,  accordingly
    submits with some merit, that even had the Judge considered the  income
    of the sponsor in the light of MM there would be little apart from that
    to justify Article 8.  It has been made clear that Article 8 is not  to
    be used to circumvent the application of the Immigration Rules.

16.  It seems to me that the merits of this matter are finely balanced.   It
    is also a matter of importance that justice not only must be done,  but
    to be seen to be done.  It is clear that the proportionality  balancing
    exercise, as envisaged in MM, was not fully conducted, given  that  the
    Judge failed to apply the wider  consideration  to  the  means  of  the
    sponsor to ask the question was it proportionate in those circumstances
    given all matters to deny entry to the appellant?  Indeed, in  granting
    permission Judge Gibb also highlights the importance of considering the
    overall impact of the decision on family life and the practical  burden
    in requiring a fresh application.

17.  I find that the Judge was clearly in error in  the  approach  taken  to
    the funding of the sponsor, overlooking indeed  the  self-direction  as
    found in paragraph 20 of the determination.

18.  In the circumstances, and with some hesitation,  I  consider  that  the
    interests of justice does require a full and  proper  consideration  of
    proportionality.

19.  In those circumstances the appellant's appeal is allowed to the  extent
    that the decision of Judge Phull is set aside to be remade by the First-
    tier Tribunal  in  accordance  with  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Directions.

20.  It will of course be incumbent upon the  appellant  to  produce  cogent
    evidence, both from herself and from the sponsor as  to  why  continued
    residence in Pakistan will significantly and adversely impinge upon her
    private and family life.  No doubt  up-to-date  evidence  as  to  means
    would also be of importance so far as the sponsor is concerned, not  to
    postdate the Immigration Rule decision but to inform the  human  rights
    argument.

21.  In granting leave, however, I do highlight a matter which in  fact  was
    touched upon by the First-tier Tribunal Judge in the determination  and
    that is whether it  would  not  be  more  expedient  to  make  a  fresh
    application  under  the  Immigration  Rules  with  all   the   relevant
    documents. In two years many matters  have  developed  or  moved  on  .
    However, that must be a matter for those advising  the  appellant.   No
    doubt the First-tier  Tribunal  will  issue  such  directions  for  the
    further progress of the hearing as may be required.

Notice of Decision

22.  The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Phull  is  set  aside.   The
    matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal in order  to  have  a  de
    novo hearing on the issue of Article 8.

23.  No anonymity direction is made.
