For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Rehman of Mayfair, Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing an appeal by  the  applicant  against  the
    decision made on 8 July 2015 refusing him further leave to remain as  a
    Tier 4 student.  In this decision, I will refer to the parties as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal, the applicant as the appellant and
    the Secretary of State as the respondent.
Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of India,  born  on  12  December  1984.  He
     arrived in the UK on 8 September 2006 with leave to remain as a student
     until 31 October 2009. On 21 April 2010 he was granted further leave to
     remain as a Tier 4 general student until 14 January 2011 and on 2 March
     2011 he was again granted further leave to remain in the same  capacity
     until 30 April 2014. On 10 August 2012  the  respondent  curtailed  his
     leave until 9 October 2012.  He was then granted leave until 3 February
     2015 but his leave was curtailed on 18 June 2014 to expire on 22 August
     2014, when he submitted a Tier  4  application  for  further  leave  to
     remain.


3.       This application  was  refused  firstly,  on  the  basis  that  the
     appellant had submitted TOEIC  certificates  from  Educational  Testing
     Service ("ETS") which were fraudulently obtained by the use of a  proxy
     test taker and secondly, because he did not have a  valid  CAS  as  the
     reference number indicated that it had been withdrawn  by  his  sponsor
     and in consequence he could not meet the points requirements set out in
     Appendix A of the Rules.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

4.   At the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  appellant  gave
      evidence that in order to seek entry clearance, he had  sat  an  IELTS
      test in India and had scored in the 5.5 band. In May 2014 he  had  set
      the test again and had scored in the 6 band.  He said that he had  sat
      the ETS test twice, the first at Eden College and the second at  South
      Quay college. When cross-examined, he denied that he had used a  proxy
      to take the tests at these colleges.

5    The judge considered the issues arising from the  allegation  that  the
      appellant had submitted a fraudulent ETS certificate in support of his
      application at [38] -  [52]  of  his  decision.  He  referred  to  the
      evidence submitted by the repondent including the  witness  statements
      from  Rebecca  Collins  and  Peter  Millington,  the  ETS  spreadsheet
      confirming that the appellant's TOEIC test was invalid, the report  by
      Professor French, a statement from Sonya Poulter and the  Home  Office
      documentation containing  extracts  from  the  investigation  "Project
      Fa�ade" into Eden College and South Quay College.

6.   The judge then referred to the guidance in the  following  authorities:
      SM and Qadir  (ETS  -  Evidence-Burden  of  Proof)  [2016]  UKUT  229,
      Secretary of State v Shehzad and Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 and  MA
      (ETS - TOEIC) [2016] UKUT 450. He referred to the  generic  statements
      from Rebecca Collins  and  Peter  Millington.  He  said  that,  having
      carefully perused the statement  of  Sonya  Poulter,  it  also  had  a
      generic appearance to it. He noted the contents  of  the  report  from
      Professor French in which he concluded that the process adopted by ETS
      in discovering which individuals had not sat the  test  was  stringent
      and would have resulted in a "false positive" rate of  less  than  1%.
      The judge commented that this document again had a generic  appearance
      and it did not expressly state that the  appellant  did  not  sit  the
      test.

7.   The judge referred to the articles from  Project  Fa�ade  showing  that
      77% of those who sat the test at  Eden  College  during  the  material
      period and 67% who sat it at South  Quay  College  had  their  results
      declared invalid but said that this was not  specific  evidence  which
      showed that the appellant did not sit the test, let alone that he fell
      within the 77%  and  67%  figures.  He  referred  to  the  spreadsheet
      attached to Sonya Poulter's statement stating that the test undertaken
      at Eden College was invalid but commented that it did not specifically
      make clear that the reason was because a proxy had taken the  test  on
      the appellant's behalf and the results of the test undertaken at South
      Quay College did not even go so far as to say  that  he  results  were
      invalid, simply that they were questionable.

8.   The judge said that in the decision letter the respondent had  asserted
      that ETS undertook a check of the appellant's test and confirmed  that
      there was "significant evidence" to conclude that his certificate  was
      obtained by the use of a proxy but  he  was  not  persuaded  that  the
      respondent had served any such "significant evidence". The judge  then
      said at [52] that whilst he had taken into account all the  additional
      evidence provided,  in  light  of  his  above  concerns,  he  was  not
      persuaded that the respondent had  discharged  the  evidential  burden
      placed upon her.

9.    So  far  as  the  ground  relating  to  the  CAS  was  concerned,  the
      application was refused on the basis that  the  appellant's  education
      provider had had its licence removed from the Sponsor Register. It was
      conceded by the respondent's representative at [54] that if the  judge
      found in the appellant's favour,  the  respondent  had  erred  by  not
      granting him 60 days leave to find another  college  to  study  at  in
      accordance with their policy and the appeal should be allowed on  that
      basis. The judge agreed and said that as the respondent had refused to
      grant the appellant 60 days leave to find a new college, that amounted
      to an error of law and the appeal  was  allowed  on  that  basis.  The
      notice of decision records that  the  appeal  was  allowed  under  the
      Immigration Rules but the intention was  clearly  only  to  allow  the
      appeal on the limited basis as conceded in accordance with the policy.

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

10.  In the first ground it is  argued  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  by
      allowing the appeal because the respondent did not give the  appellant
      60 days to find a new sponsor when the withdrawal of the  CAS  was  an
      issue for the sponsor not the respondent.  The  second  ground  argues
      that the judge erred in  law  by  his  "in  limine  rejection  of  the
      respondent's evidence as  even  sufficient  to  shift  the  evidential
      burden".

11.   Mr  Tufan  adopted  his  grounds.  He  accepted  that  he  may  be  in
      difficulties with the first ground in  the  light  of  the  concession
      recorded at [54] of the decision but he argued that in  the  light  of
      the terms of the policy  the  judge  should  not  have  accepted  that
      concession. On the second ground, he  submitted  that  the  judge  had
      erred by finding that the  respondent  had  failed  to  discharge  the
      evidential burden on  the  basis  that  the  evidence  relied  on  was
      generic. The judge had failed to analyse the evidence properly  or  to
      grapple with the issues arising from the further evidence in Professor
      French's report or to consider the implications in the evidence in the
      spreadsheet setting out an invalid and questionable  test  result  for
      the appellant.

12.  Mr Rehman submitted that the judge was right to act on  the  concession
      made by the respondent and had been entitled to allow  the  appeal  on
      the basis that it was not in  accordance  with  the  law.  So  far  as
      whether the appellant had use  a  proxy  test  taker,  the  judge  had
      considered all the  evidence  including  the  appellant's  account  of
      events. He had been  entitled  to  take  the  view  that  the  further
      evidence produced by the respondent did  not  advance  her  case.  The
      judge had in reality, so he argued, followed the threefold approach of
      considering whether  the  respondent  had  discharged  the  evidential
      burden upon her, the appellant's explanation  and  then,  whether  the
      respondent  had  discharged  the  legal  burden  of  proving  that   a
      fraudulent certificate had been produced.

Assessment of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law

13.  I shall deal firstly with the issue of whether the judge erred  in  law
      by acting in accordance with the concession  made  by  the  presenting
      officer by allowing the appeal on the basis that the respondent should
      have granted the appellant 60 days leave to find a new sponsor.  I  am
      not satisfied that he did. If a policy is to be relied on,  it  should
      be proved and produced in evidence. It is not clear whether it was and
      it appears that there were no  submissions  about  the  terms  of  the
      policy, probably in the light of the concession. In any event, it  was
      the respondent's policy and the judge was  entitled  to  rely  on  the
      concession by the presenting officer on the terms and the consequences
      of the policy in the circumstances this appeal and he did not  err  in
      law by doing so.

14.  I now turn to the second ground of the appeal. This  raises  the  issue
      of whether the judge properly applied the approach to the evidence set
      out in SM and Qadir at [57]-[59] when assessing whether the  appellant
      had submitted  a  fraudulent  test  certificate  and,  in  particular,
      whether in his decision he was simply  considering  the  first  stage,
      whether the evidential burden had been discharged, or,  as  Mr  Rehman
      argues, he adopted the threefold approach set out in that decision and
      found that the respondent had failed to discharge the burden of  proof
      on a balance of probabilities.

15.  The three-stage approach identified in SM  and  Qadir  can  briefly  be
      summarised as  firstly,  whether  the  respondent  could  satisfy  the
      evidential burden of showing that there was evidence  to  justify  the
      assertion of fraud or dishonesty; secondly, whether the appellant  was
      able to raise an innocent explanation and, if  so,  whether,  thirdly,
      the respondent could discharge  the  legal  burden  of  showing  on  a
      balance of probabilities that the assertion of fraud or dishonesty was
      made out.

16.  Mr Tufan argued that the judge had only  considered  the  first  stage,
      whether the respondent had satisfied the evidential burden,  and  that
      his finding that this burden had not been discharged was not  properly
      open to him. Mr Rehman argued that when the decision  was  read  as  a
      whole, it was clear that the  judge  considered  all  aspects  of  the
      threefold approach.

17.  I am not satisfied that it can be argued that in  [38]-[52]  the  judge
      was considering and applying all three stages of the approach  to  the
      evidence.  He focused solely on  the  initial  issue  of  whether  the
      evidential burden was discharged and explained why he found  that  not
      to be  the  case.   He  recorded  the  appellant's  evidence  and  his
      explanation of events but he made  no  finding  on  it  and  there  is
      nothing to indicate whether he accepted it or not.  The fact  that  he
      did not make any such findings indicates to me that it  was  his  view
      that it was not necessary for him  to  do  so  in  the  light  of  his
      explicit finding at [52] that the respondent had failed  to  discharge
      the evidential burden.

18.  This leads to the issue of whether,  as  Mr  Tufan  argues,  the  judge
      reached a decision properly open to him  on  whether  the  evidential
      burden had been discharged or whether to use the words of Beatson  LJ
      in [26] of Shehzad and Chowdhury  his  in  limine  rejection  of  the
      respondent's evidence even to shift  the  evidential  burden  was  an
      error of law. On that  issue,  at  (30)  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's
      judgment, Beatson LJ said:

           "But,  in  circumstances  where  the  generic  evidence  is  not
           accompanied  by  evidence  showing  that  the  individual  under
           consideration's test was categorised as  "invalid",  I  consider
           that the Secretary of State faces a difficulty in respect of the
           evidence of the initial stage."

19.  I am not satisfied that the respondent faced  any  such  difficulty  in
      the present case. There was evidence that the appellant's test  taken
      at Eden College was identified as invalid. I am  not  satisfied  that
      the failure to make it clear in the spreadsheet that the  reason  was
      because a proxy had taken the test undermines the fact that there was
      specific evidence relating to the appellant to support  a  contention
      that his result had been obtained by fraud: the generic evidence  was
      sufficient to provide a adequate basis for an inference that  it  was
      invalid because it was taken by a proxy. Further, there was  specific
      evidence relating to the test taken at  South  Quay  College  by  the
      appellant which, even though assessed as questionable,  was  capable,
      even if only to a limited extent, of supporting a  finding  that  his
      test at Eden College was taken by a proxy.

20.  There was also evidence in the articles  from  Project  Fa�ade  setting
      out the percentages of those taking the  test  at  Eden  College  and
      South Quay College whose tests were declared  invalid.  Whilst  these
      percentages do not in themselves indicate that the appellant did  not
      sit the test, they form part of  the  background  against  which  his
      evidence of an innocent explanation can be assessed and the  evidence
      is at  least  capable  of  providing  support  for  the  respondent's
      assertion that the tests taken by the appellant were by proxy.

21.  Further, the judge's comment that  the  decision  letter  had  asserted
      that ETS had confirmed  that  there  was  "significant  evidence"  to
      conclude that the certificate was obtained by use of a proxy but  the
      respondent had failed to serve any such "significant  evidence"  does
      not take the matter any further. In order to discharge the evidential
      burden,  the  respondent  did  not  necessarily   have   to   produce
      significant  evidence  but  sufficient  evidence  to  discharge   the
      evidential burden. I am satisfied that the respondent did so and that
      the judge reached a decision on this issue  which  was  not  properly
      open to him on the  evidence  and  so  erred  in  law.  The  evidence
      produced by the  respondent  was  clearly  sufficient  to  shift  the
      evidential burden.

22.  Mr Tufan submitted that in these circumstances the proper course  would
      be for the appeal to be  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
      rehearing by a different judge whereas  Mr  Rehman  argued  that  the
      matter  should  be  remitted  to  the  same  judge  to  complete  his
      assessment of the evidence. However, I am satisfied that  the  proper
      course in the light of  the  judge's  approach  to  the  respondent's
      evidence is for the appeal to be remitted for a full rehearing  by  a
      different judge on the issue of whether  the  appellant  submitted  a
      test certificate obtained by fraud. The issue relating to the  policy
      has been determined and is not to be reopened.

Decision

23.  I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that  the
      decision should be set aside.  The appeal is remitted  to  the  First-
      tier Tribunal for a full rehearing by a different judge on  the  issue
      of whether the appellant's ETS certificate was obtained by fraud.
