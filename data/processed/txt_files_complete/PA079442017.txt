                        REMAKING DECISION AND REASONS


INTRODUCTION

 1. This is the remaking component of the decision in this appeal following
    the conclusion of a panel (comprising The Hon. Lord Uist, sitting as  a
    Judge of the Upper Tribunal, and myself) that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    had erred in law when dismissing the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal of his protection and human rights  claims,  which
    had in turn been made following the instigation of deportation action.

 2. The panel's conclusions and reasons are set out in full in the appendix
    to this remaking component of the  decision.   Before  turning  to  the
    error  of  law  issue,  it  is  important  to  summarise  the  relevant
    background to the appellant's case.



BACKGROUND

 3. The appellant was born in Conakry, Guinea, on 28  December  1987.   His
    nationality has been and  remains  a  matter  of  dispute  between  the
    parties.  It appears that he arrived in the United Kingdom in September
    2002 at the age of 14.  An asylum claim was made shortly thereafter  in
    which it was asserted that the appellant was a citizen of Sierra Leone.
     Whilst that claim was refused November 2002, the appellant was granted
    exceptional leave to remain (what is now discretionary leave to remain)
    on the basis of his minority.

 4. In May 2005, the appellant accrued the first of 17 convictions in  this
    country, further details of which I will set out, below.  As  a  result
    of at least three of his initial convictions, the respondent instigated
    deportation  action  in  late  2008.   There  then   followed   various
    administrative steps which prolonged matters.  In  2010  the  appellant
    made a further asylum claim, repeating his  assertion  that  he  was  a
    citizen of Sierra Leone.  The  asylum  process  was  elongated  (it  is
    asserted by the respondent that this was in part due to the appellant's
    non-compliance with interview procedures).  A full asylum interview was
    not conducted until November 2012.  It was only in  late  January  2016
    that the appellant was served with a notice of  a  decision  to  deport
    him.  This notice included  a  certificate  under  section  72  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as amended ("NIAA 2002").
     A deportation order was signed on 24 August 2016, pursuant to  section
    32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  This was accompanied by a "stage  2"
    notice of decision to deport.  The  appellant's  protection  claim  was
    certified under section 94B NIAA 2002.  In light of the judgment of the
    Supreme Court in Kiarie and Byndloss [2017] UKSC 42; [2017] 1 WLR 2380,
    the certification decision was withdrawn and the respondent issued  the
    decision to refuse the appellant's protection and human  rights  claims
    which is the subject of this appeal.

 5. Following the lodgement of the appeal with the First-tier  Tribunal,  a
    protracted period unfolded during which a number of  adjournments  were
    sought and granted.   The  respondent  liaised  with  the  Metropolitan
    Police under the auspices of Operation Nexus and obtained large amounts
    of evidence as to the appellant's alleged criminal behaviour.

 6. One element of the delay was as a result of an adjournment  granted  in
    early January 2019 in order to give the respondent the  opportunity  to
    make  any  further  enquiries  as  to  the  authenticity  and   overall
    reliability of letters from the Sierra Leonean and Guinean Embassies in
    the United Kingdom  (dated  4  December  2018  and  19  February  2018,
    respectively).   The  respondent  did  not  take  advantage   of   this
    opportunity.



THE APPELLANT'S OFFENDING HISTORY

 7. The appellant's criminal record is not in dispute.  As mentioned above,
    he has accrued 17 convictions.  These span the period 2005 to 2013  and
    account for 25 specific offences.  Given the importance of  the  public
    interest it is appropriate to set out the record here:

           11 May 2005: robbery whilst  on  bail;  12  months'  supervision
           order;

           17 May 2007: possession of cannabis; �50 fine;

           30 July 2007: possession  of  an  offensive  weapon  in  public,
           whilst on bail; 16 weeks in a Young Offenders Institution;

           8 August 2007: obstructing powers of search for drugs and  using
           disorderly behaviour threatening  words;  28  days  in  a  Young
           Offenders Institution and �100 fine;

           25 March 2008: possession of a knife  in  public;  four  months'
           imprisonment, suspended for 12 months and 12 months' supervision
           requirement;

           29 April 2008: possession of cocaine whilst on bail: �100 fine;

           5 June 2008: failing to surrender to custody; �10 fine;

           6 June 2008: possession of  cannabis,  possession  of  a  bladed
           article  in  public,  and  failure  to  comply  with   community
           requirements  of  a   suspended   sentence   order;   4   weeks'
           imprisonment and activation of previous suspended sentence of 16
           weeks;

           15 July 2008: possession of bladed article in public; 8  months'
           imprisonment;

           16 December 2008: possession of ammunition without  certificate;
           �100 fine;

           10 March 2010: possession of cannabis whilst on  bail;  1  days'
           detention;

           21 April 2010: possession  of  crack  cocaine  whilst  on  bail;
           community order requiring unpaid work;

           11 May 2010: possession of cannabis whilst on bail; �50 fine;

           6  July  2010:  common  assault,  criminal  damage,  and   using
           threatening  words  or  behaviour;  a   total   of   6   months'
           imprisonment;

           15 October 2010: robbery and possession of a  knife  in  public;
           total of 3 years' imprisonment;

           1 December 2010: possession of heroin whilst on bail; 2  months'
           imprisonment;

           22  March  2013:  possession  of  crack   cocaine;   2   months'
           imprisonment.

 8. The Operation Nexus evidence relating to matters in  respect  of  which
    charges were not brought against the appellant was not, in  the  event,
    relied on by the respondent before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  has
    played no part in my considerations.



THE DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

 9. Before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant  argued  that  he  was
    neither a citizen of Sierra Leone nor Guinea: in other  words,  he  was
    stateless.  In respect of Article 8, the appellant did not contend that
    he had a family life in the United Kingdom.

10. The claim of statelessness was predicated on the  two  Embassy  letters
    referred to  above.   That  emanating  from  the  Guinean  authorities,
    written and signed by the Consul, Mr or Ms Iromou, stated as follows:

           "To whom it may concern

           This letter is to confirm that after an investigation  from  the
           Ministry of Interior in [sic] and per the Home Office  documents
           submitted to the Embassy by Mr Barry, it  has  been  established
           that,  Mr  Mohamed  Barry  born  28/12/1987  is  not  a  Guinean
           national.

           Please do not hesitate to contact  us  if  you  require  further
           information."

11. The letter from the Sierra Leonean Embassy stated that:

           "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

           This is to confirm that Mohamed Barry, D.O.B 28th December 1987,
           who is currently residing at [...] Has been interviewed  by  the
           High Commission and has proved beyond reasonable doubt  that  he
           is not a Sierra Leonean Citizen.

           All assistance rendered to him will be highly appreciated."

12. On any view, the judge's decision was conscientious and  indicative  of
    good deal of thought.  Whilst one specific aspect of his  findings  and
    conclusions involved the making of  an  error  of  law,  several  other
    issues were dealt with more than adequately.  The panel  preserved  the
    following conclusions (in respect of which  only  the  fourth  was  the
    subject of any challenge in the grounds of appeal):

              i. the appellant was  excluded  from  the  protection  of  the
                 Refugee Convention as a result  of  the  upholding  of  the
                 certificate issued under section 72 NIAA 2002.   He  was  a
                 danger to the community of the United Kingdom;




             ii. the appellant was excluded from Humanitarian Protection  by
                 virtue of his offending history;


            iii. the rejection of the Article 3 claim (which, on the  facts,
                 had the effect of rejecting the  substance  of  the  asylum
                 claim as well);


             iv. the absence of  social  and  cultural  integration  in  the
                 United Kingdom  and,  as  a  consequence,  the  appellant's
                 inability to bring himself within Exception 1 under section
                 117C(4) NIAA 2002 and paragraph 399A the Immigration Rules.

13. In respect of the statelessness issue, the judge stated at [32] that it
    was "uncontroversial that the appellant is  not  a  citizen  of  Sierra
    Leone."  Thus, the core factual issue for determination was whether  or
    not the appellant was a citizen of Guinea (see [33]), or whether he was
    indeed stateless.  In this  regard,  the  most  important  passage  the
    judge's decision is contained at [72]:

           "Drawing the threads together, I find as a  fact  the  appellant
           was born in Conakry and his family all had Guinean  nationality.
           I also find the appellant was not in Sierra Leone.  I  find  the
           appellant was educated in Guinea up  to  the  age  of  14.   The
           circumstances would tend to show the appellant was  Guinean.   I
           accept the letter from  the  Embassy  shows  that  records  were
           searched in good faith and the  appellant's  registration  could
           not be found.  I  accept  that  the  Canadian  authorities  were
           entitled to conclude on that basis that the  appellant  was  not
           Guinean and to refuse him a travel document.  However,  I  infer
           from the appellant's readiness to mislead  the  respondent  over
           many years and not just when he was a minor and his  willingness
           to give misleading evidence to the tribunal that  the  appellant
           did not cooperate by giving truthful information to the  Guinean
           Embassy.  He must have subverted the  process  as  he  had  done
           previously by leading the respondent to believe  he  was  Sierra
           Leonean, even to the point of attending an ETD interview."

14. The judge expressly found that the appellant was a Guinean citizen.  As
    a consequence, and in light of the  appellant's  overall  circumstances
    (including  his  age  when  he  left  Guinea,  his  relatively  lengthy
    residence in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  strong  public  interest
    engendered by the offending history), the judge  went  on  to  conclude
    that  the  protection  claim  failed  and  that  there  were  no  "very
    compelling circumstances" over and above those contained within the two
    exceptions, with reference to section 117C(6) NIAA  2002.   The  appeal
    was dismissed on all grounds.



THE PANEL'S ERROR OF LAW CONCLUSIONS

15. The central reasoning in the panel's  conclusion  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law, are contained in paragraphs 5 and 6  of  its
    decision:

           "5 . In our judgment the judge was correct to say that this  was
           not a case in which a shared duty to establish nationality arose
           and the judge was correct so to hold. A shared duty arises where
           an appellant has done all that he could to  obtain  evidence  of
           nationality (or lack of it) but requires further evidence  which
           can be obtained by  the  Secretary  of  State  but  not  by  the
           appellant himself. That was not the position in this  case.  The
           appellant did not require any further evidence to establish that
           he was not a Guinean national. He had obtained what was probably
           the best evidence available in the form of  an  official  letter
           from the Guinean Embassy stating  that  he  was  not  a  Guinean
           national. It was then for the Secretary of State, if  he  could,
           to produce evidence rebutting the content of the letter. He  did
           not do so: indeed, he did not even attempt to do so, despite the
           directions from the Tribunal. It  was  not  suggested  that  the
           letter was a forgery. It bears the appellant's correct name  and
           date of birth. In these circumstances it constituted very strong
           evidence that the appellant was  not  a  Guinean  national.  The
           reason why the judge did not accept the content  of  the  letter
           was because he formed  a  generally  unfavourable  view  of  the
           appellant's credibility.

           ([72] of the judge's decision is then quoted in full)

           6. The finding by the judge that  the  appellant  "did  not  co-
           operate by giving truthful information to the  Guinean  Embassy"
           and that "he must have subverted  the  process"  are  in  effect
           findings by the judge that the appellant obtained the letter  by
           fraudulent means. The problem is  that  there  was  no  specific
           evidence on the basis of which he was entitled to  make  such  a
           finding and it therefore amounts to a material error of law.  In
           order to make such a damning finding against the  appellant  the
           judge would have  to  have  had  some  evidence  pointing  to  a
           specific fraud perpetrated by the appellant in order  to  obtain
           the letter, but the fact of the matter is that there was no such
           evidence. The respondent had made no  inquiries  about  how  the
           letter was obtained and there was  therefore  a  lacuna  in  the
           evidence. It was not for the judge to fill that lacuna by making
           a finding adverse to the appellant and contrary to the terms  of
           the letter without any evidence to support it. The fact that the
           appellant had previously acted dishonestly does  not  provide  a
           proper  basis  for  concluding  that  he  acted  dishonestly  in
           obtaining the letter. Properly analysed this is not a case of  a
           shared burden but of  a  finding  of  fact  unsupported  by  the
           evidence.

16. The panel went on to  conclude  that  error  made  in  respect  of  the
    statelessness issue  was  relevant  to  the  question  of  whether  the
    appellant could show that there were "very compelling circumstances" in
    his case, with reference to section 117C(6) NIAA 2002 and the Rules.



THE ISSUES IN THIS APPEAL

17. As stated at paragraph 15 of the panel's decision and in my  subsequent
    directions notice sent out to the parties on 22 April 2020,  the  scope
    of the remaking of the decision in this appeal is narrow.   There  are,
    in essence, two issues arising; one factual and the other legal.

18. The factual question is:

           whether the  appellant  is  stateless,  or,  as  the  respondent
           contends, he is de jure a national of Guinea.

19. The legal issue can be divided into three parts:

           first, if the appellant  is  not  truly  status,  what  are  the
           consequences for his appeal?

           second, if the answer to  the  factual  question  is  "yes",  is
           statelessness  capable  of  amounting  to  a  "very   compelling
           circumstance" over and above those  described  in  Exception  1,
           with reference to section 117C(4) and (6) NIAA 2002?

           third, if it is so capable, what weight should be attributed  to
           that circumstance generally and on the particular facts of  this
           case?

20. None of the preserved conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal's decision
    have sought to be revisited at the remaking stage.



PROCEDURAL ISSUE: THE RESPONDENT'S ADJOURNMENT APPLICATION

21. At the outset of the remote hearing, Mr Whitwell  made  an  adjournment
    application on the basis that he did not have the Home Office file, nor
    was he in possession of the appellant's bundle.  As  a  result  of  the
    Covid-19 pandemic, he was appearing from home and had not been provided
    with these  materials.   He  had  sought  to  contact  the  appellant's
    solicitors the day before in order to obtain a copy  of  their  bundle,
    but to no avail.

22. Whilst having sympathy with Mr Whitwell's position, Mr Lee opposed  the
    application on the grounds that the issues in  this  appeal  were  very
    narrow, as set out above.  In addition, the evidence upon  which  these
    issues rested was also extremely limited; it amounted,  in  effect,  to
    the letter from the Guinean Embassy (the letter from the Sierra Leonean
    Embassy no longer or  any  relevance).   The  respondent  had  been  in
    possession of this letter since 2018 and no action had  been  taken  in
    respect of it.

23. At that stage, I declined to make a final decision on the  application,
    pending any further steps that could be taken in order to  ensure  that
    Mr Whitwell was in a fair position to present  the  respondent's  case.
    The hearing was "paused" at 12:11, the representatives  released  until
    14:00, and I instructed my clerk to scan and email the  relevant  parts
    of the appellant's bundle, namely the three witness statements and  the
    letters from the  Guinean and Sierra Leonean Embassies  (the  remaining
    items  evidence  contained  within  bundle   were   out-dated   country
    information reports which were not being relied upon by the appellant).
     This was done, with confirmation by Mr  Whitwell  of  receipt  of  the
    email and attachments occurring at 12:26.

24. Upon resumption of the hearing at  14:00,  I  refused  the  adjournment
    application.  My reasons for so doing are as follows.

25. First, the issues in this appeal were indeed narrow.  The scope of  the
    resumed hearing was set  out  in  clear  terms  in  the  error  of  law
    conclusions, which had been promulgated on  25  February  2020.   Thus,
    this was not a case involving a number of complex  issues  or  a  large
    amount of evidence.

26. Second, Mr Whitwell had appeared before the Tribunal at  the  error  of
    law stage in February 2020.  Although that was some months back, he was
    clearly familiar with the case and the relevant issues.

27. Third, Mr Whitwell had been provided with the  relevant  parts  of  the
    appellant's bundle by email on the day of the remote  hearing.   I  was
    satisfied that he had had sufficient time to read  and  digestive  this
    evidence prior to submissions beginning at 14:00.

28. Fourth, Mr Whitwell  was  clearly  able  to  make  submissions  on  the
    evidence and the factual issue of whether the appellant was  stateless.



29. Fifth, Mr Whitwell  had  been  able  to  check  the  respondent's  GCID
    database in advance of the hearing and was able to confirm  that  there
    was no record of the respondent having sought any further  evidence  in
    respect of the appellant's claimed statelessness.  He was also able  to
    confirm that the Home Office file had been placed in  storage  at  some
    point.  Thus, it would have  been  impossible  for  him  to  have  been
    provided with that file for the hearing in any event.  That  is  not  a
    criticism of Mr Whitwell (who, I wish to make clear, acquitted  himself
    in a highly professional manner in these proceedings), but it does  not
    perhaps reflect particularly well on  the  respondent's  organisational
    systems in respect of 'live' cases.

30. Sixth, and finally, I assessed all of these considerations through  the
    all-important  prism  of  fairness  to  the  parties,  in   this   case
    specifically the respondent.  I will satisfied that, in  all  the  very
    particular circumstances, Mr Whitwell was properly and fairly  able  to
    present the respondent's case without material prejudice.




THE EVIDENCE

31. In remaking  the  decision  in  this  appeal,  I  have  considered  the
    following evidence:

              i. the three witness statements from the appellant, one  dated
                 the 15 February 2018 and the other two being undated;




             ii. the letter from the Guinean Embassy dated 19 February 2018;




            iii. the letter from the Sierra Leonean Embassy dated 4 December
                 2018.

32. In light of what has already been discussed, it is only the second item
    of evidence which addresses the Guinean nationality issue.



THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS

33. I record here my gratitude to both representatives  for  their  concise
    and clear submissions in this case.

34. Mr Lee relied on his brief skeleton argument, dated 21 July  2020,  the
    letter from the Guinean Embassy, and the panel's conclusions reached on
    the error of law issue, in particular the passages set out above.  When
    the letter was combined with the panel's conclusions, and then  set  in
    the context of the guidance provided by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  AS
    (Guinea) [2018] EWCA Civ 2234; [2019] Imm AR 341, it was submitted that
    there was  only  one  proper  outcome  to  the  factual  question:  the
    appellant is stateless.  Mr Lee emphasised the respondent's  acceptance
    that the appellant was not a citizen of  Sierra  Leone.   He  submitted
    that the appellant had done all he could to prove this  aspect  of  his
    case and the respondent's failure to have taken any steps of  her  own,
    notwithstanding specific directions from the First-tier  Tribunal,  was
    telling.  Mr Lee submitted that there was no evidence to show that  the
    appellant would be admitted to Guinea,  Sierra  Leone,  or  indeed  any
    other state.

35. Addressing the legal question, Mr Lee accepted that in order to succeed
    in his appeal the Appellant  needed  to  show  that  there  were  "very
    compelling circumstances" or a "very strong claim indeed",  with  there
    being no difference between the two  thresholds.   The  requisite  very
    powerful factor lay in the fact of statelessness.   Mr  Lee  relied  on
    section 5(1) of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  and  submitted  that  the
    appellant could not be deported  to  a  country  where  he  was  not  a
    national and there was no reason to believe that he would otherwise  be
    admitted.  In essence, the appellant's deportation would not be capable
    of performance and this was sufficient for him to make  out  his  case.
    Reference is also made to the  respondent's  policy  guidance  entitled
    "Stateless Leave", version 3.0, published on new 30  October  2019,  in
    which it is said that individuals refused leave  to  remain  under  the
    general grounds of refusal, but who are stateless,  cannot  be  removed
    and thus may fall for a grant  of  leave  outside  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Mr Lee helpfully confirmed that after his own  researchers,  he
    was unable to find any other decided cases from the Upper  Tribunal  or
    the Court of Appeal which had reached reasoned conclusions on the issue
    of statelessness in the context of deportation.

36. Mr Whitwell relied on the respondent's reasons for refusal letter.   He
    clearly set out the respondent's position: first, it was  not  accepted
    that the appellant is stateless; second, this  case  is  not  in  truth
    about statelessness, but rather involves the appellant being, at  most,
    in the situation of "limbo", and in this regard any barriers to removal
    are administrative in nature and do not permit the appellant to succeed
    in his appeal.

37. As to  the  factual  issue,  Mr  Whitwell  asked  me  to  consider  the
    appellant's overall  history  of  adverse  credibility,  together  with
    deficiencies and/or other concerns relating  to  the  letter  from  the
    Guinean Embassy itself. the appellant had lied about his nationality in
    the past, having claimed for a prolonged  period  that  he  was  Sierra
    Leonean.  This was relevant to the assessment of  the  Embassy  letter.
    The appellant had not been called  to  give  evidence  at  this  stage,
    without explanation.  This too  was  relevant.   The  appellant  had  a
    vested interest in not  assisting  or  indeed  misleading  the  Guinean
    authorities.

38. As to the Embassy letter itself, he  had  not  been  able  to  see  the
    original.  There was no subsequent letter from the  Embassy  to  verify
    the authenticity of the initial letter or the position of the author of
    that letter.  Mr Whitwell noted the existence of a Gmail email  account
    stated at the bottom of the Embassy letter.  There was no  schedule  of
    the evidence that had been provided by the appellant  to  the  Embassy,
    nor indeed had any of that evidence (if any existed) been submitted for
    this appeal.  It was unclear what the parameters of the "investigation"
    carried out by the authorities had been.  It was an accepted fact  that
    the appellant had been born in Conakry, had attended school  in  Guinea
    until the age of 14, and had family members who were citizens  of  that
    country, including at least one sibling.  The appellant never  produced
    his birth certificate, which presumably would have  been  required  for
    him to have attended school.  The Embassy letter was now two years  old
    and there was nothing to show that the authorities had not subsequently
    changed  their  views  of  the  appellant's  status.   The  letter  was
    addressed "To whom it may concern", and  it  was  unclear  whether  the
    document had been written for consideration in legal proceedings.

39. In summary, Mr Whitwell submitted that the "best evidence" provided  by
    the appellant was simply not good enough, and it  failed  to  discharge
    the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities.

40. On the legal question, Mr Whitwell submitted that the appellant  should
    not be permitted to circumvent Exception  1  in  section  117C(4)  NIAA
    2002.   The  appellant's  inability  to  satisfy  this  exception   was
    important.  Once section 117C(6) came into play,  the  public  interest
    had to be taken into account.  It was submitted that as  the  appellant
    was not stateless, he was simply in a position  of  "limbo".   Reliance
    was placed on RA (Iraq) [2019] EWCA Civ 850; [2019] Imm AR  1212,  with
    particular reference to paragraphs 59-71.  Properly analysed, submitted
    Mr Whitwell, this was indeed a "limbo" case  and,  on  the  facts,  the
    appellant simply could not succeed.

41. In reply, Mr Lee objected to the scope of Mr Whitwell's attack  on  the
    Embassy letter.  He  submitted  that  no  such  criticisms  as  to  the
    authenticity/bona fides of that  letter  had  been  raised  previously.
    There had  been  no  cross-appeal  by  the  respondent,  or  any  other
    notification that the previous  decision  adopted  in  respect  of  the
    letter was being withdrawn.  The respondent's failure to have  complied
    with previous directions from the First-tier Tribunal  was  emphasised.
    As to the appellant not been called to give  evidence  at  the  resumed
    hearing, Mr Lee submitted that he had been  given  legal  advice  based
    upon the conclusions and reasons stated by the panel in  the  error  of
    law decision.

42. Mr Lee reiterated his submission that this was not a "limbo" case.   He
    referred me to paragraphs 74-75 and 97 of RA (Iraq).  This case was not
    about a lack of  documentation,  but  rather  a  lack  of  nationality.
    Finally, Mr Lee acknowledged that the  public  interest  was  in  play,
    given that the appellant was having to rely  on  section  117C(6)  NIAA
    2002.   However,  he  submitted  that  the  statelessness   issue   was
    sufficient for the appellant to succeed.

43. As mentioned earlier, at the end of the hearing I deemed it appropriate
    to seek further written submissions from the respondent on the question
    of whether statelessness (if proved)  was  capable  of  constituting  a
    "very compelling circumstances" in the context of section 117C(6)  NIAA
    2002 and the overall  proportionality  exercise.   Directions  to  that
    effect were sent out to the parties on 31 July 2020.

44. In the event, I received written submissions  from  Mr  Whitwell  on  4
    September 2020, but nothing from the appellant.  I was  satisfied  that
    both the directions and Mr which Wells submissions had been sent to the
    appellant's solicitors and Mr Lee.

45. I will deal with the relevant aspects of Mr Whitwell's submissions when
    setting out my conclusions, below.



FINDINGS OF FACT

46. I direct myself to the authoritative guidance set out by the  Court  of
    Appeal in AS  (Guinea).   Having  reviewed  the  relevant  authorities,
    Kitchin LJ stated that paragraph 57 :

           "57. These authorities reveal a consistent line of reasoning.  A
           person  claiming  to  be  stateless  must  take  all  reasonably
           practicable steps to gather together and  submit  all  documents
           and other materials which  evidence  his  or  her  identity  and
           residence in the state or states in issue, and  which  otherwise
           bear upon his or her nationality. The applicant  ought  also  to
           apply for nationality of the state or states with  which  he  or
           she has the closest connection. Generally, these are steps  that
           can be taken without any risk. If, in the words of Elias LJ, the
           applicant comes up against a brick wall, then, depending on  the
           reasons given, the adjudicator will decide whether the applicant
           has established statelessness, and will do so on the balance  of
           probabilities. Of course, from time to time, there may be  cases
           where it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to take
           this course, and in those cases  the  Secretary  of  State  will
           assist the applicant by making enquiries on his  or  her  behalf
           but again there is no reason  why  the  issue  of  statelessness
           cannot be decided on the balance of probabilities. By  contrast,
           in refugee cases, it is necessary to make an assessment of  what
           may happen in the future in another  country,  and  whether  the
           applicant faces a real risk of persecution there. This is a very
           different kind of assessment and it is one which, by its nature,
           justifies the adoption of a  different  and  lower  standard  of
           proof. I recognise that, as the appellant and UNHCR  contend  in
           their sixth submission, many  of  the  cases  to  which  I  have
           referred were decided before the promulgation by  UNHCR  of  the
           guidance in 2012 and the Handbook in 2014 but in my judgment the
           reasoning in these decisions remains robust and authoritative."

47. I begin my assessment by recognising that  the  appellant  has  clearly
    lied about his nationality in  the  past,  claiming  over  a  prolonged
    period that he was Sierra Leonean.  Indeed, he has  admitted  to  this.
    It is also  abundantly  clear  from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that it was less  than  impressed  with  the  appellant  as  a
    witness.

48. Mr Whitwell  is  correct  to  highlight  other  adverse  matters.   The
    appellant did,  and  still  does,  have  an  interest  in  the  Guinean
    authorities concluding that he was not  a  national  of  that  country.
    This, combined with the evidence from the Sierra  Leonean  authorities,
    would appear to assist him in showing that he was stateless,  which  in
    turn would be beneficial to his desire to remain in the United Kingdom.
     There is also real merit in his emphasis on  the  now  uncontroversial
    facts that the appellant himself asserts that he is a Guinean national;
    was born in Guinea to Guinean parents; grew up  in  that  country;  was
    educated there until the age of 14; that certain other  family  members
    hold and/or have held Guinean citizenship; and that he  has  failed  to
    adduce any evidence aside from the Embassy letter.   These  are  potent
    arguments against the appellant.

49. Another strand of Mr Whitwell's  submissions  focused  on  the  factual
    question is that the appellant has failed to provide either a  schedule
    of the evidence he presented to the Guinean authorities or any  of  the
    evidence itself.  The absence of such certainly  does  not  assist  the
    appellant's case.

50. It is also of note that the appellant has not given  oral  evidence  in
    this  Tribunal,  nor  indeed  has  even  provided  an  updated  witness
    statement.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  has  made  a
    statelessness application to the respondent pursuant  to  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules.

51. However, what had not been argued by the respondent before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal was that the Embassy letter of 19  February  2018  was  a
    forgery, or that the document was written and provided  otherwise  than
    in good faith (see [43]).  The judge went on at  [72]  to  specifically
    find that the letter had indeed been produced in good faith,  following
    a search of the relevant records.  Nothing in the respondent's skeleton
    argument prepared for the error of law hearing made  any  reference  to
    matters going to the authenticity and/or bona fides of the letter.

52. Of further relevance is the  fact,  as  I  find  it  to  be,  that  the
    respondent has at no stage endeavoured to undertake enquiries with  the
    Guinean authorities regarding the appellant's nationality,  or  claimed
    lack thereof.  This inaction makes it more difficult for the respondent
    now to contend that the letter is  unreliable  by  virtue  of  concerns
    raised about its provenance (as opposed to  what  evidence  should  the
    appellant may or may not have presented to the officials).

53. Bringing  the  above  matters  together,  I  find  that  Mr  Whitwell's
    criticisms of the letter, insofar as they  relate  to  its  provenance,
    should be rejected.  I find that the letter was in fact written by  the
    Consul, and that this was done in good faith following an investigation
    based on what the appellant told the authorities or provided to them by
    way of Home Office documents.

54. I acknowledge the panel's view  that  the  Embassy  letter  constituted
    "very strong" evidence that the Guinean authorities did not believe him
    to be a national of that country and that this evidence  was  "probably
    the best evidence" that he  could  have  adduced.   On  reflection  and
    having considered the evidence before me as a whole,  the  observations
    contained in the error of law decision could have been expressed  in  a
    more nuanced fashion, albeit that  this  would  not  have  changed  the
    effect of what was being said.

55. The precise (and  very  limited)  wording  of  the  Embassy  letter  is
    instructive: the investigations were carried out "per the  Home  Office
    documents" submitted to the Embassy by the appellant  and  led  to  the
    conclusion that the appellant was not a Guinean national.  It is  quite
    clear that a number of  the  Home  Office  documents  relating  to  the
    appellant's  case  over  time  contained  incorrect  information;   for
    example, the assertion that he was a Sierra Leonean national.  Further,
    it is  impossible  to  know  precisely  what  the  appellant  told  the
    officials at the Embassy about his connections with Guinea as  we  have
    no relevant evidence from him on this issue.  That is not to  say  that
    he actively told the officials false information in order to  "subvert"
    their investigations (as had been found by  the  First-tier  Tribunal).
    However, the import of the letter  is  that  the  non-establishment  of
    nationality was predicated on the basis of the information provided and
    (unspecified) checks undertaken by the Ministry of the Interior.  Thus,
    the  letter  did  indeed  represent  "very  strong"  evidence  of  that
    conclusion, but this was to be seen in the context of an  investigation
    carried out on the basis of information, aspects of which are  entirely
    unknown, others which were  inaccurate  (relating  to  historical  Home
    Office documents), and some which I accept were true, in particular the
    appellant's name and date of birth.

56. The letter was and remains the "best evidence" that the appellant could
    have provided as to the Guinean authorities' conclusion  that,  on  the
    information provided (such as we  know  it  to  be)  and  following  an
    investigation presumably based upon that information, the appellant  is
    not currently recognised as a national of that country.

57. It is now uncontroversial that the  appellant  is  not  a  national  of
    Sierra Leone and would not be  entitled  to  the  nationality  of  that
    country.

58. Is the appellant therefore stateless?  The term "stateless  person"  is
    defined in Article 1 of the 1954 Convention relating to the  Status  of
    Stateless Persons as follows:

           "For the purpose of this Convention, the term "stateless person"
           means a person who is not considered as a national by any  State
           under the operation of its law."

59. This definition has been adopted in the  Immigration  Rules,  paragraph
    401 of which provides:

           "401. For the purposes of this Part  a  stateless  person  is  a
           person who:

           (a) satisfies the requirements  of  Article  1(1)  of  the  1954
           United Nations Convention relating to the  Status  of  Stateless
           Persons, as a person who is not considered as a national by  any
           State under the operation of its law;

           (b) is in the United Kingdom; and

           (c) is not excluded from recognition as a Stateless person under
           paragraph 402."

    It is common ground that none of the exclusion criteria under paragraph
    402 apply in this case.

60. Bringing all of the above matters together, I find that  the  appellant
    has failed to show,  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  he  is
    stateless within the meaning  of  the  1954  Convention.   The  Embassy
    letter proves that the  authorities  have  concluded  that  he  is  not
    currently a national of that country.  It has not  however  been  shown
    that this position is as result of the operation of Guinean law, as  is
    required by the definition set out in the Convention.  The letter makes
    no reference to any operative legislative provisions which preclude the
    appellant from having the nationality of that country (as opposed to  a
    lack of information provided in order to  establish  eligibility),  nor
    has  he  provided  any  evidence  in  respect  of  the  relevant  legal
    framework.  On the evidence before me, there are in my view clear prima
    facie indications that the appellant could or would in principle  be  a
    national (he was born in the country to Guinean parents;  has  siblings
    who are or were Guinean nationals; was educated there; and  resided  in
    the country until the age of 14).

61.  The  core  factual  question  is  therefore  determined  against   the
    appellant.



CONCLUSIONS

62. As I have found the appellant not to be stateless, the second and third
    aspects of the legal question identified earlier do not arise.

63. As matters stand, although he is not stateless the appellant cannot  be
    deported to Guinea.  I conclude that this scenario engages the  "limbo"
    situation, as explained by the Court of Appeal in RA (Iraq) [2019] EWCA
    Civ 850; [2019] 4 WLR 132 at paragraphs 63-71.

64. As the appellant is already subject to a deportation order, I  consider
    that he is in a state of "actual limbo", notwithstanding the fact  that
    the respondent has in fact yet to attempt a removal.

65. On the evidence before me, it is not apparent that the appellant cannot
    be deported in the foreseeable future; nor can it be  said  that  there
    are no further steps that may be taken by either  party  to  facilitate
    deportation for  example  by  the  respondent  communicating  with  the
    Guinean authorities or the appellant seeking to adduce further evidence
    from family members who are (or were) nationals of that country  so  as
    to assist in establishing  nationality  on  better  evidence  than  was
    provided previously.   It  cannot  be  said  at  this  stage  that  the
    prospects of removal in consequence of the respondent's refusal of  the
    human rights claim are sufficiently remote.

66. I turn to  analyse  the  appellant's  overall  circumstances.   He  has
    clearly spent a long time in the  United  Kingdom,  now  just  over  18
    years.   That  residence  has  been  lawful  because  he  was   granted
    discretionary leave to remain as a  minor  and  his  in-time  extension
    application was not refused until the decision  now  under  appeal  was
    made in 2017, following which he will have enjoyed leave under  section
    3C of the Immigration Act 1971.  A sizeable portion  of  the  delay  in
    dealing with that extension application was down to the appellant's own
    failure to cooperate  with  the  authorities  as  regards  his  claimed
    nationality.  The appellant has no family in this country and does  not
    suffer from any material health problems.  There is a preserved finding
    that he is not socially and culturally integrated into British society.
     Whilst he has clearly established a  private  life  in  this  country,
    there is no reliable evidence of any significant ties here.  It is also
    the case that he is a danger to the community  (a  consequence  of  the
    upholding of the section 72 certificate).   His  offending  history  is
    very poor indeed (even leaving out of account what appears to  be  very
    recent matters highlighted in Mr Whitwell's written submissions).   The
    appellant's case has not been argued on the basis that he would not  be
    able  to  reintegrate  into  the  society  of  that   country   without
    experiencing very significant obstacles in so doing  (bearing  in  mind
    that the existent of such obstacles would not,  of  themselves,  go  to
    establish very compelling  circumstances  under  section  117C(6)  NIAA
    2002).  The extant deportation order was only  made  in  2016  and  the
    decision  under  appeal  in  2017,  neither  of   which   render   them
    particularly "old".  As indicated above, it cannot yet properly be said
    that the prospects of deporting the appellant are remote.

67. I now move on to the necessary balancing exercise, taking into  account
    the mandatory considerations under sections 117B and 117C NIAA 2002 and
    having regard to relevant case-law.

68. On the appellant's side of the balance sheet,  it  is  inescapably  the
    case  that  there  is  very  little  to  say.   This  fact   has   been
    realistically reflected in Mr Lee's focus on the statelessness issue as
    opposed to any of the appellant's other circumstances.  The  length  of
    his lawful residence in this country together with the relatively young
    age at which he arrived (14) are the weightiest matters in his  favour.



69. Against him are ranged the following.  There is a  very  strong  public
    interest in deporting  this  individual,  as  recognised  not  only  in
    section 117C(1) NIAA 2002, but by the seriousness of his offending  and
    the finding by the First-tier Tribunal that he constitutes a danger  to
    the community of the United Kingdom.  He has no established family life
    in this country.  He is unable to meet either of the  Exceptions  under
    section 117C(4) and (5) NIAA 2002.

70. Even on the actual limbo scenario, the appellant still  needs  to  show
    that very compelling circumstances exist in his case.  It has not  been
    suggested that his length of residence in the age at which  he  arrived
    here themselves constitute a sufficiently strong Article 8  claim.   In
    my judgment, that is an entirely realistic position to have adopted.

71. Overall, it cannot be said that the  very  strong  public  interest  is
    diminished (or to put it another way, outweighed) by any factors on the
    appellant's side of the balance sheet,  whether  these  are  viewed  in
    isolation or cumulatively.

72. Therefore, the appellant is unable to show  that  the  refusal  of  his
    human rights claim is unlawful, notwithstanding the fact that he is not
    at present removable from the United Kingdom.  In other words,  at  the
    point in time at which I am determining this appeal,  the  consequences
    of  the  respondent's  refusal  of  the  human  rights  claim  are  not
    disproportionate.  As recognised in RA (Iraq), there may come  a  stage
    when  all  possible  avenues  to  establish  the  appellant's   Guinean
    nationality and/or other means of  facilitating  a  removal  have  been
    exhausted and that the prospect of deporting him  from  United  Kingdom
    could be considered so remote that Article 8 might provide a route  for
    success.  In my judgment, that stage has not yet been reached,  and  by
    some distance.

73. What would the consequences be if I had found that  the  appellant  was
    truly stateless within the meaning of the 1954 Convention?   The  issue
    is wholly academic,  but  I  would  make  the  following  observations.
    First, the fact of statelessness would not render the deportation order
    itself unlawful.  Second, I would conclude that statelessness could  in
    principle be capable of constituting a  very  compelling  circumstance.
    Third, I would also take the view that if it  were  firmly  established
    that the individual concerned  simply  could  not  be  removed  to  any
    country in consequence of the refusal of a human rights claim  (whether
    due to statelessness or the absence of any basis to suppose that he/she
    would be admitted to another country in any event), and that there  was
    no realistic prospect of removal occurring in the  foreseeable  future,
    the very compelling circumstances threshold might be met.

74. On the material  findings  and  conclusions  set  out  previously,  the
    appellant's appeal must fail.




ANONYMITY

Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by Mohamed Barry, who was born on  28  December  1987
    and whose nationality is a matter of dispute, against the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Froom ("the judge") promulgated on  7  August
    2019 dismissing his appeal against the Secretary of State's decision of
    24 July 2017 to  refuse  his  protection  and  human  rights  claim,  a
    deportation order having been made against him on 23 August 2016.

 2. The first ground of appeal is that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  his
    approach to the question whether or not the appellant was stateless. He
    noted that the appellant had obtained a letter from the Guinean Embassy
    (the bona fides  of  which  were  accepted  by  the  respondent)  which
    concluded, without reservation, that the appellant was  not  a  Guinean
    national and there was a  letter  in  similar  terms  from  the  Sierra
    Leonian authorities confirming that he  was  not  a  national  of  that
    country. He noted that the letter  had  been  properly  served  on  the
    respondent and that the Tribunal had directed the respondent to provide
    her response to the letter and any enquiries made of  the  authorities.
    On the day of the substantive hearing the respondent admitted  that  he
    had made no attempt to contact the Guinean Embassy. At the  hearing  it
    was not submitted by the respondent  that  the  appellant  might  be  a
    national of Sierra Leone,  but  that  he  was  a  national  of  Guinea,
    notwithstanding the letter from the Guinean Embassy. It  was  submitted
    on behalf of the appellant that the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
    AS (Guinea) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA
    Civ 2234 was relevant to the appeal  and  the  judge  considered  other
    relevant authorities which established that  in  certain  circumstances
    there is a shared burden  on  the  appellant  and  respondent  to  make
    enquiry to establish whether or not the appellant is stateless.  It  is
    asserted that the judge erred in concluding  that  the  respondent  was
    under no such obligation in this case. The judge noted at  para  44  of
    his decision that the letter  from  the  Guinean  Embassy  stated  that
    investigations had been carried out in Guinea itself and the conclusion
    was, in unequivocal terms, that the  appellant  did  not  have  Guinean
    nationality. It did not, for  example,  state  that  it  could  not  be
    established whether he was a Guinean national. The letter was,  on  the
    face of it, powerful evidence in support of the appellant's  case.  The
    context of the letter was that the  respondent  had  been  given  every
    opportunity (and directed by  the  First-tier  Tribunal)  to  make  any
    enquiry he wished about the circumstances of the letter  being  written
    and its content. Instead, he chose to do nothing. He failed to disclose
    any correspondence  arising  out  of  his  attempts  to  obtain  travel
    documentation from the Guinean Embassy since 16 September 2016. In that
    context the judge's conclusion that the appellant  must  have  led  the
    Guinean authorities in some unspecified way  in  order  to  obtain  the
    letter was unfair, particularly as the respondent was under a  duty  to
    help establish the position and could have done so  by  contacting  the
    embassy. The appellant had attended the embassy, answered questions and
    obtained the letter. To conclude  that  the  respondent  was  under  no
    obligation to assist in those circumstances amounted  to  an  error  in
    law.

 3. In response it was submitted that the judge's finding (at  para  72  of
    his decision) that the appellant did not co-operate by giving  truthful
    information to the Guinean Embassy was more  than  adequately  reasoned
    and open to  him  on  the  evidence.  Accordingly,  the  issue  of  the
    respondent assisting the appellant with discharging the burden of proof
    simply did not arise. The judge noted (at para 56 of his decision) that
    he was not told what questions  the  Guinean  Embassy  had  asked,  the
    extent of the appellant's response or whether he  was  claiming  to  be
    truthful or accurate in such response, let alone  what  documents  were
    lodged with the Guinean Embassy. His conclusion had  to  be  viewed  in
    light of his holistic assessment of the appellant's credibility, having
    decided that the appellant had lied about being  Sierra  Leonean  (para
    32), that he was "a less than impressive witness" (para 57),  at  times
    "evasive" (para 61) and "aggressive in response to difficult questions"
    (para 89). He noted (at para 66) that the  appellant's  evidence  would
    indicate that he was entitled to Guinean nationality and (at paras  68-
    70) that a number of his siblings had either been born  in  Conakry  or
    claimed to be Guinean nationals, as had a cousin.

 4. The letter  from  the  Guinean  Embassy  is  on  the  Embassy's  headed
    notepaper, dated 19 February 2018, addressed "to whom it may  concern",
    bears to be signed by the consul and  is  franked  with  the  Embassy's
    stamp. It reads as follows:

         "This letter is to confirm that after  an  investigation  from  the
         Ministry of the Interior in  and  per  the  Home  Office  documents
         submitted to the Embassy by Mr Barry, it has been established that,
         Mr Mohamed Barry born 28/12/1987 is not a Guinean national.

         Please do not  hesitate  to  contact  us  if  you  require  further
      information."

 5. In our judgment the judge was correct to say that this was not  a  case
    in which a shared duty to establish nationality arose and the judge was
    correct so to hold. A shared duty arises where an  appellant  has  done
    all that he could to obtain evidence of nationality (or lack of it) but
    requires further evidence which can be obtained  by  the  Secretary  of
    State but not by the appellant himself. That was not  the  position  in
    this case. The appellant  did  not  require  any  further  evidence  to
    establish that he was not a Guinean national. He had obtained what  was
    probably the best evidence available in the form of an official  letter
    from the Guinean Embassy stating that he was not a Guinean national. It
    was then for the Secretary of State, if he could, to  produce  evidence
    rebutting the content of the letter. He did not do so: indeed,  he  did
    not even attempt to do so, despite the directions from the Tribunal. It
    was not  suggested  that  the  letter  was  a  forgery.  It  bears  the
    appellant's correct name and date of birth. In these  circumstances  it
    constituted very strong evidence that the appellant was not  a  Guinean
    national. The reason why the judge did not accept the  content  of  the
    letter was because he formed  a  generally  unfavourable  view  of  the
    appellant's credibility. He dealt with the point as follows at para  72
    of his decision:

         "Drawing the threads together, I find as fact  that  the  appellant
         was born in Conakry and his family all had Guinean  nationality.  I
         also find the appellant  was  not  in  Sierra  Leone.  I  find  the
         appellant was educated in  Guinea  up  to  the  age  of  14.  These
         circumstances would tend to show that the appellant was Guinean.  I
         accept the letter from the Embassy shows that records were searched
         in good faith and the appellant's registration could not be  found.
         I accept the Guinean authorities were entitled to conclude on  that
         basis that the appellant was not Guinean and to refuse him a travel
         document. However,  I  infer  from  the  appellant's  readiness  to
         mislead the respondent over many years and not just when he  was  a
         minor and his  willingness  to  give  misleading  evidence  to  the
         tribunal that the appellant did not co-operate by  giving  truthful
         information to the Guinean Embassy.  He  must  have  subverted  the
         process as he had done previously  by  leading  the  respondent  to
         believe he was Sierra Leonean, even to the point  of  attending  an
         ETD interview."

   6. The finding by the judge that the appellant  "did  not  co-operate  by
      giving truthful information to the Guinean Embassy" and that "he  must
      have subverted the process" are in effect findings by the  judge  that
      the appellant obtained the letter by fraudulent means. The problem  is
      that there was no specific evidence on  the  basis  of  which  he  was
      entitled to make such a finding and it therefore amounts to a material
      error of law. In order to make such  a  damning  finding  against  the
      appellant the judge would have to have had some evidence pointing to a
      specific fraud perpetrated by the appellant in  order  to  obtain  the
      letter, but the fact of the matter is that there was no such evidence.
      The respondent had made no inquiries about how the letter was obtained
      and there was therefore a lacuna in the evidence. It was not  for  the
      judge to fill that lacuna by making a finding adverse to the appellant
      and contrary to the terms  of  the  letter  without  any  evidence  to
      support  it.  The  fact  that  the  appellant  had  previously   acted
      dishonestly does not provide a proper basis  for  concluding  that  he
      acted dishonestly in obtaining the letter. Properly analysed  this  is
      not a case of a shared burden but of a finding of fact unsupported  by
      the evidence.

   7. The second ground of appeal is that the judge erred in his approach to
      para 399A(b) and (c) of the  Immigration  Rules  (and,  by  extension,
      section 117C(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002).
      He accepted that the appellant had been lawfully resident  in  the  UK
      most of his  life  but  did  not  accept  that  he  was  socially  and
      culturally integrated in the UK, or that there were  very  significant
      obstacles to his integration in the country of his proposed return. It
      was submitted that, when considering social and cultural  integration,
      he left out of account the principle enunciated by the  respondent  in
      his published guidance Criminality: Article 8 ECHR Cases  Version  8.0
      which states:

         "If the person has been present in the UK from a very early age  it
         is unlikely that  offending  alone  would  mean  a  person  is  not
         socially and culturally integrated."

   8. The appellant had entered the UK as a child and attended school  here.
      In relation to rule 399A(iii) the judge had made a series of  findings
      which prima facie pointed inexorably  towards  a  finding  that  there
      would be very significant obstacles  to  his  integration  in  Guinea,
      namely, the fact that he had left there as  a  child,  had  no  useful
      knowledge of the lifestyle, systems, customs or practices  there,  and
      had no family or friends there.

   9. In reply the respondent submitted that the appellant  cannot  sensibly
      have been said to have resided in the UK from a very early age as  the
      judge found (at para 97) that he had remained in Guinea till  the  age
      of 14. His consideration of the issue of  integration  did  not  focus
      solely on the  appellant's  offending.  The  grounds  of  appeal  also
      ignored a fuller reading of the guidance referred  to.  Moreover,  the
      principle of the strength of residence from an early age was  recently
      commented on by the Court of Appeal in Akinyemi v Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2098 at paras 50-51. That case
      did  not  offer  the  appellant  any  support  and  could  be   easily
      distinguished on the facts as the appellant had been born in  the  UK,
      had never left the country and had not applied for British nationality
      despite being entitled to it. In any event the judge  considered  that
      the appellant was not a "home grown criminal" (para  127).  He  relied
      (at para 126) on the decision in Binbuga v Secretary of State for  the
      Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 551  at  para  126  to  conclude  that
      paragraph 399A(b) of the Immigration Rules was not met  (para  130  of
      his decision). His decision on this point was careful and focused  and
      did not reveal any material error of law.  In  relation  to  paragraph
      399A(c) it was submitted that it was not a fact that the appellant had
      no family or friends  in  Guinea,  but  merely  an  assertion  by  the
      appellant himself. It also ignored the findings of fact, which had not
      been expressly challenged, at para 97 of the judge's  decision,  where
      he found that  the  appellant  was  a  young,  healthy  male  with  no
      dependents, spoke French, was resourceful and would have  some  family
      members in Guinea and elsewhere who could assist him to resettle, even
      if he could not rely on his mother or his uncles and aunts,  and  that
      he would not be left  destitute.  The  judge  had  also  recorded  the
      appellant's inconsistent accounts of his family history, that  he  had
      been separated from his family at the age of seven (para 3)  and  that
      he had been sent to the United Kingdom at the age of 14 by his parents
      (para 18).

  10. In our judgment it cannot be said that the judge has materially  erred
      in law in respect of paragraph 399A(b) of the Immigration  Rules.  The
      error committed in relation to the statelessness issue could not  have
      had a  material  bearing  on  the  question  of  social  and  cultural
      integration in United Kingdom.  The  judge  directed  himself  to  the
      relevant authorities including Binbuga and AM (Somalia) v Secretary of
      State for the Home  Department  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  774  and  correctly
      approached paragraph 399A(b) on a fact-sensitive basis.  In  light  of
      the findings made at paras 112-117 and 129-130, the judge was entitled
      to conclude  that  the  appellant  was  not  socially  and  culturally
      integrated in  the  United  Kingdom,  even  if  such  links  had  been
      established in the past.

  11. The absence of an error has the consequence that the  appellant  could
      not succeed under paragraph 399A of the  Immigration  Rules.  This  is
      because all three limbs of  that  provision  must  be  met  (see,  for
      example, Tirabi (Deportation: "lawfully resident": s.5(1)) [2018] UKUT
      00199 (IAC)).

  12. That is not, however,  the  end  of  the  matter  in  so  far  as  the
      appellant's appeal is concerned. We are satisfied that  by  committing
      the error in relation to the statelessness issue, the judge failed  to
      take a material factor into account when assessing whether there would
      be "very significant obstacles" to the  appellant's  integration  into
      Guinean  society,  with  reference  to  paragraph   399A(c)   of   the
      Immigration Rules. For the reason set out in the preceding  paragraph,
      this could not have assisted the appellant under paragraph  399A,  but
      the error is  relevant  to  the  judge's  assessment  of  whether  the
      appellant had been able to show "very  compelling  circumstances  over
      and above" those described in the  exception.  When  considering  this
      question, the judge specifically left the statelessness issue  out  of
      account (see paras 144 and 146). In view  of  our  conclusion  on  the
      first ground, there was a consequential failure to consider a relevant
      factor. It cannot be said that the  wider  proportionality  assessment
      would on any view have  been  determined  against  the  appellant  and
      therefore the error identified in respect of ground one had a material
      bearing on the outcome of the appeal.

  13. In light of the foregoing, we set the judge's decision aside.

  14. By way of disposal, this case is to be retained in the Upper  Tribunal
      and set down for a  resumed  hearing  in  due  course.  The  following
      findings of the First-tier Tribunal are preserved:

             a) the upholding of the certificate issued under section 72 of
                the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  and  the
                appellant's consequent exclusion from the protection of the
                Refugee Convention;

             b) the appellant's exclusion from Humanitarian Protection;

             c) the rejection of the appellant's Article 3 ECHR claim;

             d) the absence of  social  and  cultural  integration  in  the
                United Kingdom  and  the  inability  of  the  appellant  to
                satisfy  the  exception  under  paragraph   399A   of   the
                Immigration Rules and section 117C(4) of  the  Nationality,
                Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

  15. The scope of the resumed hearing will therefore be limited. The  Upper
      Tribunal will consider the  questions  of  statelessness  and  whether
      there are "very compelling circumstances over and above" those set out
      in the exception contained in paragraph 399A and  section  117C(4)  of
      the 2002 Act.

  16. Directions to the parties are set out, below.
