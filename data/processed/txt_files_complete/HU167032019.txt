Representation:

For the appellant:           Mr E. Fripp, instructed by Rashid & Rashid
Solicitors
For the respondent:          Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed the respondent's decision  dated  30  September
    2019 to refuse a human rights claim.

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Zahed ("the judge") dismissed the appeal  in
    a decision promulgated on 20 March 2020.

3.    The  appellant  appealed  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on  the
    following grounds:

       i) The judge erred in finding that the  appellant  did  not  produce
          sufficient evidence to show continuous residence in  the  written
          decision, when he had indicated at the hearing that  he  accepted
          he had been resident for 20 years.

      ii) The judge erred in failing to consider the arguments put  forward
          on behalf of the appellant relating to the 'Suitability' criteria
          and/or the fact that the general grounds  for  refusal  were  not
          mandatory.

     iii) As a result, the judge erred in his  assessment  of  the  overall
          balancing exercise under Article 8.

4.     Mr  Philip  Nathan,  who  appeared  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    admitted in the grounds that he did not take  a  note  of  the  judge's
    indication and had no recollection of it. It is surprising that he  did
    not take a careful note of such an indication in  accordance  with  his
    professional duties if one was made. However, his instructing solicitor
    sent an interpreter to the hearing, who  has  made  a  brief  statement
    confirming that their recollection is that the  judge  stated  that  he
    accepted that the appellant had resided in the UK for at least 20 years
    and asked the representatives to make submissions on the  'Suitability'
    criteria. A statement from  the  appellant's  solicitor,  who  did  not
    attend the hearing, says  that  he  had  taken  instructions  from  the
    appellant who also said that he recalled the judge  accepting  that  he
    had been resident for 20 years. It is unclear why a statement  was  not
    prepared in the appellant's name  rather  than  producing  third  party
    evidence  from  his  solicitor.  No  contemporaneous  notes  have  been
    produced.

5.    Further to the grant of permission  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Zahed
    was asked  to  comment  on  the  assertions  made  in  the  grounds.  A
    memorandum issued by Principal Resident Judge Kopieczek, which was sent
    on 21 October 2020, quoted the judge's response:

            "I do not recall that I stated to the PO that  I  have  accepted
           that the appellate (sic) has satisfied  me  that  he  has  lived
           continuously in the UK for at least 20 years. I  note  that  the
           (sic) my ROP  does  not  mention  that  and  that  the  PO  made
           submissions on it."

6.    The judge's record of the  proceedings  noted  that  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer highlighted that the appellant did not  produce  any
    documentary evidence to show residence from 2006  to  2011.  The  brief
    summary of the respondent's submissions indicated that  the  Presenting
    Officer mentioned that the appellant said he had returned  to  Albania.
    It is likely that this was a reference to the two  visits  recorded  in
    the decision letter in 2015. The note then records:  "Present  over  20
    years - Travelled to Albanian (sic) - no  documentary  evidence  of  20
    years.". The note of the appellant's submissions  states  that  counsel
    relied on his skeleton argument, stated that the appellant was resident
    for 20 years 5 months. In relation to  the  'Suitability'  requirements
    there is  a  note  that  there  was  no  revocation  of  leave  and  no
    enforcement action  for  2  years  after  May  2016.  The  judge  noted
    reference to the case of Balajigari & Others v SSHD [2019] 1  WLR  4647
    and submissions relating to the respondent's discretion.

7.    Mr Tufan also produced a summary made by the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer after the First-tier Tribunal hearing. The note does not appear
    to be a record of the proceedings. For example, it does not  include  a
    record of the questions and  answers  nor  a  contemporaneous  note  of
    discussions or indications given by the judge.  The  summary  indicates
    that the focus of the Home Office Presenting Officer's submissions  was
    on  the  'Suitability'  requirement  although  it  is  noted  that  the
    Presenting Officer stated that "no proof of continuous living in the UK
    has been provided". The Presenting Officer summarised  the  appellant's
    representative  as  having  submitted  that  the  appellant  had  given
    evidence, supported by documents, to show that he had been  present  in
    the UK for a period of more than 20 years.

8.    A face to face hearing was not held because  it  was  not  practicable
    due to public health measures put in place to  control  the  spread  of
    Covid-19. The appeal was heard by way of a remote hearing by Skype  for
    Business with the parties' consent. All issues could be determined in a
    remote hearing.

Decision and reasons

9.    In order to show a material error of law in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision Mr Fripp accepted that the appellant would need to succeed  on
    both the first and second grounds.  Even  if  the  case  was  taken  at
    highest and it was accepted that he was  continuously  resident  for  a
    period of 20 years he would still need to show that there was an  error
    in the judge's findings relating to the 'Suitability' requirements.  As
    indicated at the hearing, the third generalised ground relating to  the
    overall balancing exercise under Article 8 is only likely to succeed if
    the first two grounds are made out, in which case  the  factors  to  be
    taken into account might have been weighed slightly differently.

10.   In light of these observations it makes sense to deal with the  second
    ground first. If the judge's findings  relating  to  the  'Suitability'
    criteria are sustainable then it matters not whether  he  had  accepted
    that the appellant had been resident for  a  continuous  period  of  20
    years.

11.   The thrust of the second ground, as argued at the  hearing,  was  that
    the  judge  failed  to  consider  the  discretionary  nature   of   the
    'Suitability'  provisions  contained  in  paragraph  S-LTR  4.1-4.3  of
    Appendix FM of the immigration rules. Paragraph S.LTR.4.1  states  that
    an applicant "may be refused  on  grounds  of  suitability  if  any  of
    paragraphs S-LTR.4.2 to S-LTR.4.5 apply.". The appellant  accepts  that
    he lied about his  identity  when  he  first  arrived  in  the  UK  and
    maintained the false identity until 2016. It is not disputed  that  the
    appellant made false representations in previous applications and  that
    the 'Suitability' provisions might apply.

12.   The judge summarised the respondent's  reasons  for  refusal  and  the
    appellant's response. He noted the  main  aspects  of  the  appellant's
    evidence. The appellant accepted that he lied about his  identity  when
    he claimed asylum. The appellant explained that he did not  have  leave
    to remain and was unable to produce any formal documentary evidence  to
    show that he was resident throughout the period. The judge noted  other
    evidence in the form  of  a  witness  statement  from  the  appellant's
    solicitor relating to another case. He also recorded the details of the
    GCID note which indicated that he was given Exceptional Leave to Remain
    (ELR) until his 18th birthday based on the false date of birth given on
    arrival. A further GCID note from 2014 recorded the  following  reasons
    for granting a period of Discretionary Leave to Remain (DLR):

            "Mr Florjan Zyberi (sic) was previously granted ELR for 7 months
           up until his 18th birthday and his basis to remain in the UK  is
           still the same, through  fear  of  persecution  in  Kosovo.  The
           applicant has resided in the UK now for 14 years 11  months  and
           will have undoubtedly established a certain  degree  of  private
           life, and claims  that  he  has  no  known  whereabouts  to  his
           family/friends back home in Kosovo therefore would be alone  and
           vulnerable as a single young man in Kosovo."

13.   Having set out the case put forward by both  parties,  and  summarised
    the evidence, the judge went on to make his findings. He concluded that
    if the appellant had given his correct details,  he  would  never  have
    been granted ELR as an unaccompanied asylum-seeking  child  because  he
    was not a minor at the time. If the respondent had known that he was an
    Albanian national, he would have been liable to  removal  to  his  home
    country. The judge went on to find that  the  appellant  continued  the
    deception that he was a Kosovan national when he  applied  for  further
    leave to remain. The GCID note indicated that he was granted  leave  in
    2014 primarily because it was thought that he was  a  Kosovan  national
    who still claimed to fear persecution and that  he  did  not  have  any
    family members there. Had it not been for his continued  deception,  he
    would have been liable to removal to Albania, where on his own evidence
    he continues to have family connections.

14.   In assessing whether the human rights claim should have  been  refused
    under the 'Suitability' criteria the judge made the following finding:

                     "23.    I find that the respondent  took  into  account
                 that 16 � years of his residence in the United Kingdom  was
                 based on deception. I find that the deception was so great,
                 where the appellant knew that if  he  had  given  his  real
                 identity he would have been returned  to  Albania  and  for
                 such a length of time  in  which  he  was  able  to  obtain
                 further leave that allowed him to work in the UK and obtain
                 a Travel Document that the respondent was entitled to  find
                 that the appellant did not meet the suitability  conditions
                 and  that  [the]  application  falls  for   refusal   under
                 suitability."

15.   Nothing in this wording suggests  that  the  judge  proceeded  on  the
    basis that it was a mandatory provision. He considered whether  refusal
    on 'Suitability' grounds was justified and gave reasons why it was.   I
    accept that the judge did not specifically mention the  fact  that  the
    provisions contained in paragraph S-LTR.4.1  of  Appendix  FM  are  not
    framed  in  mandatory  terms.  The  mere  fact  of  this  omission   is
    insufficient reason to find an error of law if no adequate reasons were
    given as to why discretion should have been exercised  differently.  On
    the face of it the appellant accepted that  he  was  dishonest  in  the
    initial and subsequent applications for leave to enter or remain and it
    was open to the judge to find that the circumstances justified  refusal
    under the 'Suitability' criteria.

16.   The skeleton argument produced in  support  of  the  appellant's  case
    before the First-tier Tribunal hearing submitted  that  the  respondent
    erred in refusing the  application  with  reference  to  paragraphs  S-
    LTR.4.2 and 4.3 but the argument at [�8] does nothing more than  assert
    that the provision is not mandatory. No reasons were particularised  as
    to why discretion should have been exercised in the appellant's favour.
    At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal it appears  that  counsel
    argued that relevant factors  might  include  the  fact  that  (i)  the
    respondent decided not to revoke DLR but instead  let  it  expire;  and
    (ii) then took no enforcement action for over 2 years.

17.   At the hearing before  the  Upper  Tribunal,  Mr  Fripp  repeated  the
    general submission as to the  non-mandatory  nature  of  refusal  under
    paragraph S-LTR.4.1 of Appendix FM. When asked to identify what factors
    were put forward to the First-tier  Tribunal  that  might  justify  the
    exercise of discretion he said (i) the appellant had been  resident  in
    the UK for a significant period of time; and  (ii)  the  fact  that  he
    disclosed his true identity voluntarily should  have  been  considered.
    Neither of those factors appear to have been argued before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. Mr  Fripp  also  referred  me  to  the  decision  in  PS
    (paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed) India [2010]  UKUT  440  in
    which the Upper Tribunal stated that the decision maker  must  exercise
    great care in considering whether  to  apply  the  general  ground  for
    refusal under paragraph 320(11) of the immigration rules.

18.    Despite  the  shifting  arguments  put  forward  on  behalf  of   the
    appellant, I find that none of the factors disclose any material  error
    of law in the judge's findings relating to refusal under  paragraph  S-
    LTR.4.1 of Appendix FM.

19.   The judge was aware of the appellant's immigration history, which  was
    set out in his decision with reference  to  the  evidence.  It  is  not
    arguable that  the  fact  that  the  respondent  did  not  curtail  the
    appellant's DLR or take action to remove him would have been sufficient
    reason to exercise discretion not to refuse the application on  grounds
    of 'Suitability'. The appellant applied to transfer the  conditions  of
    his DLR to an Albanian passport in his real identity on 31 March  2016.
    The respondent refused the application on 26 May 2016 and a  subsequent
    application on 22 August 2016. Little weight could have been placed  on
    the fact this his leave was not curtailed when it  was  due  to  expire
    only a few months  later,  on  18  January  2017.  The  fact  that  the
    respondent did not take enforcement action only assisted the  appellant
    to come closer to 20 years' residence. Neither of these  factors  would
    come close to making any material difference to the judge's  conclusion
    that the deception was so great, and maintained over such a long period
    of time, that refusal was justified.

20.   Mr Fripp's further points do not appear to  have  been  argued  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. In any event, they would  not  have  made  any
    material difference to the assessment. The fact  that  a  person  might
    have  completed  20  years  residence  is  not  a  reason  to  exercise
    discretion when the  structure  of  the  rules  makes  clear  that  the
    eligibility requirement of 20  years  residence  is  still  subject  to
    refusal on grounds of 'Suitability'. Nor is the fact that the appellant
    voluntarily disclosed his real identity in 2016,  17  years  after  the
    initial deception, a matter that should count in  his  favour  when  he
    should not have lied to obtain leave to enter or remain  in  the  first
    place. The decision in PF (India) does not assist  the  appellant.  The
    comments of the Upper Tribunal were made in the context of a  different
    set of provisions in the immigration rules, which  exempted  a  certain
    category of family life cases from automatic refusal. It  was  in  that
    context that the Upper Tribunal emphasised the need  for  caution  when
    the Secretary of State sought to apply a  different  provision  of  the
    immigration rule to justify refusal when a person otherwise  would  not
    be subject to refusal. In this case, there was ample reason to  justify
    refusal under the  'Suitability'  criteria  given  that  the  appellant
    admitted to a serious and long-standing deception.

21.   For the reasons given above, I find that it was open to the  judge  to
    consider the serious nature of the deception and  the  length  of  time
    which the appellant maintained it when he concluded  that  refusal  was
    justified with reference to the 'Suitability' requirements. None of the
    varying reasons put forward on behalf of the appellant would have  made
    any material difference to his conclusion.

22.   In light of my finding that the decision did not  involve  the  making
    of a material  error  of  law  in  relation  to  the  judge's  findings
    regarding 'Suitability', it is not necessary to come to  any  concluded
    view as to whether the judge did or did not express a firm  view  about
    the issue of 20 years continuous residence at the hearing. The evidence
    set out above [4-7] does not provide a clear picture. On the  one  hand
    there is evidence  to  suggest  that  the  judge  may  have  given  the
    impression to  the  appellant  and  the  interpreter  employed  by  his
    representative that he might not need to be persuaded  on  that  issue.
    This is supported to some extent by the judge's record  of  proceedings
    and the Presenting Officer's note, which indicate  that  there  was  an
    emphasis on the 'Suitability' requirements in submissions. However, the
    same documents indicate that some submissions may have been made  about
    20 years residence. If the judge did comment, it seems that it may  not
    have been a clear or emphatic indication if the representatives went on
    to make oral submissions on the  issue.  In  the  end  it  matters  not
    because even if there is an error of approach it  would  have  made  no
    material difference to the outcome of the  appeal  in  so  far  as  the
    judge's  findings  relating  to   paragraph   276ADE(1)(iii)   of   the
    immigration rules were concerned.

23.   The third point relating  to  the  overall  balancing  exercise  under
    Article 8 was reliant on  the  first  and  second  grounds  succeeding.
    Except for his length of residence, the appellant  did  not  raise  any
    other significant issues that may have been relevant to  the  balancing
    exercise. The judge was  required  to  take  into  account  the  public
    interest considerations contained in section 117B of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA 2002"),  which  obliged  him  to
    give little weight to the appellant's  private  life  in  circumstances
    where he did not meet the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    immigration  rules.  The  same  factors  that  justified  refusal  with
    reference to paragraph S-LTR.4.1 of Appendix FM were additional factors
    to weigh in the public interest in maintaining an effective  system  of
    immigration control.

24.   It was not pursued at the hearing, but the  grounds  argued  that  the
    judge failed to consider the evidence relating to a similar  case.  The
    facts of a single non-related case were irrelevant  to  the  individual
    assessment required in this case. Again, the same  solicitor,  who  did
    not give evidence, made a statement about what happened in another case
    with little supporting evidence.  On  the  face  of  it  the  case  was
    different because it involved a decision to exercise discretion not  to
    deprive British citizenship. No evidence  was  produced  to  show  what
    evidence might have been before the respondent in that case,  what  the
    person's personal circumstances might have been, or whether there  were
    any compelling circumstances in that case that might have justified the
    decision not to deprive the person of citizenship. The evidence was not
    capable of making any material difference to the balancing exercise  in
    this case.

25.   For the reasons given about I conclude that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision did not involve the making of a material error on a  point  of
    law. The decision shall stand.
