Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and background facts:

 1. The appellants have been granted permission to appeal the  decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Coll  (hereafter  the  "judge")  who,
    following a hearing on 28 March 2017, dismissed their appeals against a
    decision of the respondent of 8 December  2015  by  which  she  refused
    their applications of 19 August 2015 for leave to remain on  the  basis
    of their rights to their family and private lives under  Article  8  of
    the 1950 European Convention for the Protection  of  Human  Rights  and
    Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).

 2. The appellants are nationals of India. The first appellant, born on [ ]
    1979, is the wife of the second appellant, born on [ ] 1975.  They  are
    the parents of the third appellant, born on [ ]  2002.  The  appellants
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 10 August  2009,  aged  (respectively)
    thirty years, thirty-four years and seven-and-a-half years.

 3. The first appellant arrived with leave as a  student,  the  second  and
    third appellants with leave as her dependants, valid until 31 May 2013.
    On 28 May 2013, the first appellant applied  for  further  leave  as  a
    student with the second and third appellants  as  her  dependants.  The
    application was refused because there were insufficient funds  for  the
    fee to  be  taken  and  the  application  was  therefore  invalid.  The
    appellants re-applied on 22 June 2013, by which time  their  leave  had
    expired. Their applications were refused. They did not have a right  of
    appeal, although they did appeal. Their appeals were dismissed  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal in a determination promulgated on 16 March 2015. On
    18 May 2015,  permission  to  appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. On 15 July 2015, permission to  appeal  was  refused  by  the
    Upper Tribunal. A month  later,  on  19  August  2015,  they  made  the
    application which was the subject of the appeal before Judge Coll.  Two
    months after the applications were made, on 28 October 2015, a son  was
    born to the first and second appellants. He is  not  a  party  to  this
    appeal, although the judge (correctly) considered the circumstances  of
    the entire family, including the son, in assessing the Article 8  claim
    outside the Rules.

 4. The appellants had lived in the United Kingdom for six years as at  the
    date of their applications (19 August 2015) and six years three  months
    as at date of the decision (8 December 2015). However, by the  date  of
    the hearing (28 March 2017), they had lived in the United  Kingdom  for
    seven years seven months. This meant that it became necessary  for  the
    judge to consider s.117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 and the principle in R  (MA  (Pakistan)  and  others)  v  SSHD
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705, that the fact that a child has been in the  United
    Kingdom for seven years or more should be given significant  weight  in
    the proportionality exercise, in assessing the Article 8 claims outside
    the Rules.

 5. In MA (Pakistan), the Court of Appeal said that it was established as a
    starting point that leave should be granted unless there were  powerful
    reasons to the contrary (para 49).  However, at para 44, the  Court  of
    Appeal made it clear that it is not  the  case  that  leave  to  remain
    should be refused only in exceptional circumstances. What a court  must
    do is to make "a full and careful assessment of the best  interests  of
    the child before any balancing exercise can be undertaken. If  that  is
    not done there is a danger that  those  interests  will  be  overridden
    simply because their full significance has not  been  appreciated.  The
    court must not treat the other considerations  as  so  powerful  as  to
    assume that they must inevitably outweigh the  child's  best  interests
    whatever they might be, with the result that no proper assessment takes
    place."

 6. The respondent  has  issued  guidance  to  decision-makers  considering
    whether it is reasonable to expect a child to leave the United Kingdom.
    The judge considered  that  guidance  in  her  decision,  referring  to
    individual factors mentioned  in  the  respondent's  guidance.  It  may
    therefore be helpful to quote the relevant part  of  the  guidance,  as
    this is not set out in the judge's decision. The relevant part is  para
    11.2.4 of the respondent's Immigration Directorate Instructions  (IDIs)
    entitled:  "Immigration  Directorate  Instruction   Family   Migration:
    Appendix FM Section 1.0b, Family Life (as  a  Partner  or  parent)  and
    Private Life: 10-year route. August 2015". Para 11.2.4 reads:

         "11.2.4. Would it be unreasonable to expect a  non-British  Citizen
         child to leave the UK?

         The requirement that a non-British Citizen child has lived  in  the
         UK  for  a  continuous  period  of  at  least  the  [sic]  7  years
         immediately preceding the date of application, recognises that over
         time children start to put down roots and integrate  into  life  in
         the UK, to the extent that being required to leave the  UK  may  be
         unreasonable. The longer the child has resided in the UK, the  more
         the balance will begin to swing in terms of it  being  unreasonable
         to expect the child to leave the UK, and  strong  reasons  will  be
         required in order to refuse a case with continuous UK residence  of
         more than 7 years.

         The  decision  maker  must  consider  whether,  in   the   specific
         circumstances of the case, it would be  reasonable  to  expect  the
         child to live in another country.

         The decision maker must consider the facts relating to  each  child
         in the UK in the family individually, and  also  consider  all  the
         facts relating to the family as a whole. The decision maker  should
         also engage with any  specific  issues  explicitly  raised  by  the
         family, by each child or on behalf of each child.

         Relevant considerations are likely to include:

         a. Whether there would be a significant risk to the child's health

             For example, if there is evidence that the child is undergoing
             a course of  treatment  for  a  life  threatening  or  serious
             illness and treatment will not be available in the country  of
             return;

         b. Whether the child would be leaving the UK with their parent(s)

             It is generally  the  case  that  it  is  in  a  child's  best
             interests to  remain  with  their  parent(s).  Unless  special
             factors apply, it will generally be  reasonable  to  expect  a
             child to leave the UK with their  parent(s),  particularly  if
             the parent(s) have no right to remain in the UK;

         c. The extent of wider family ties in the UK

             The decision maker must consider the extent to which the child
             is dependent on or requires support from wider family  members
             in the UK in important areas of his or her life;

         d. Whether the child is likely to be able to (re)integrate  readily
             into life in another country. Relevant factors include:

             ?   whether the parent(s) and/or child are a  citizen  of  the
                  country and so able to enjoy the full rights  of  being  a
                  citizen in that country;

             ?   whether the  parent(s)  and/or  child  have  lived  in  or
                  visited the country before for periods of more than a  few
                  weeks. The question here is  whether,  having  visited  or
                  lived in the country before, the  child  would  be  better
                  able to adapt, and/or  the  parent(s)  would  be  able  to
                  support the child in adapting, to life in the country;

             ?   whether the parent(s) and/or child have existing family or
                  social ties with the country. A person  who  has  extended
                  family or a network of friends in the  country  should  be
                  able to rely on them for  support  to  help  (re)integrate
                  there;

             ?   whether the parent(s) and/or child have relevant  cultural
                  ties with the country. The caseworker  must  consider  any
                  evidence of exposure to, and the  level  of  understanding
                  of, the cultural norms of  the  country.  For  example,  a
                  period of time spent living mainly amongst a diaspora from
                  the country may give a child an awareness of  the  culture
                  of the country;

             ?   whether the parents and/or child can speak, read and write
                  in a language of that country, or are  likely  to  achieve
                  this within a  reasonable  time  period.  Fluency  is  not
                  required - an  ability  to  communicate  competently  with
                  sympathetic interlocutors would normally suffice;

             ?   whether the child has attended school in that country.

         e. Any country specific  information,  including  as  contained  in
             relevant country guidance

         f. Other specific factors raised by or on behalf of the child.

         Parents or children may highlight the differences in the quality of
         education, health and wider  public  services  or  in  economic  or
         social opportunities between the UK and the country of  return  and
         argue that these would work against the best interests of the child
         if they had to leave the UK and live in that country. Other than in
         exceptional circumstances, this will not  normally  be  a  relevant
         consideration, particularly if the parent(s) or wider  family  have
         the means or resources to  support  the  child  on  return  or  the
         skills, education or  training  to  provide  for  their  family  on
         return, or if Assisted Voluntary Return support is available."

The grounds

 7. Permission was sought on three grounds, i.e. (i) that the judge  failed
    to follow a staged assessment of the third  appellant's  circumstances;
    (ii) that the judge unlawfully applied  a  test  of  exceptionality  by
    requiring the third appellant to have shown "extraordinary  talents  or
    unusual achievements" and (iii) the judge failed to consider the "'near-
    miss' background to this case".

 8. Permission was granted by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  P  J  M
    Hollingworth. In summary, the permission judge considered that: (i) the
    judge arguably failed to apply MA (Pakistan) in that  it  was  arguable
    that she gave insufficient weight to the third appellant's  integration
    in the United Kingdom he and the impact of uprooting her as  recognised
    by the seven-year rule, she arguably concentrated on the  situation  on
    return and arguably gave excessive weight to the  immigration  history;
    (ii) arguably, she made insufficient findings; and (iii)  she  arguably
    gave  excessive  weight  to  the  actions  of  the   parents   in   the
    proportionality exercise when considering the argument about delay.

 9. At the hearing, Mr  Malik  confirmed  that  he  only  relied  upon  the
    following three grounds and that he did not wish to  pursue  any  other
    grounds in the written grounds or the terms  in  which  permission  was
    granted:

    (i)    (hereafter "ground 1") The judge erred  in  law  by  failing  to
         conduct a structured analysis of the best interests  of  the  third
         appellant and her family's Article 8 claim.

         The  judge  should  have  considered  the  third  appellant's  best
         interests at the beginning of the balancing  exercise  and  without
         taking into account the conduct of her parents.  Having  considered
         the best interests of the child, she should then have  gone  on  to
         consider  the  public  interest  considerations  and  whether  they
         override the best interests of the child.

    (ii)   (hereafter "ground 2") The judge erred in law in her  assessment
         of the best interests of the child, in that, she took into account,
         at paras 84 and 86, the conduct of the parents. Mr  Malik  accepted
         that the judge was entitled  to  take  into  account  the  parents'
         conduct in assessing the reasonableness of the  child  leaving  the
         United Kingdom. However, he submitted that she erred  in  doing  so
         when she considered the best interests of the third appellant.

    (iii)  (hereafter "ground 3") The judge erred  in  law  by  failing  to
         recognise the significance of the fact that the third appellant had
         lived in the United Kingdom for seven years,  as  para  91  of  her
         decision demonstrates.

10. The grounds did not challenge the judge's  assessment  of  credibility,
    nor did Mr Malik raise this at the hearing before me.

The judge's decision

11. The appellants all gave evidence  before  the  judge.  In  addition,  a
    relative (an uncle) gave evidence.

12. It was accepted on the  appellants'  behalf,  that  their  appeals  had
    little prospect of success under the Rules  (para  17  of  the  judge's
    decision). The focus of their appeals was Article 8 outside  the  Rules
    (para 18). In particular, reliance was placed  on  the  fact  that  the
    third appellant had lived in the United Kingdom  for  more  than  seven
    years. It was not reasonable for her to leave the United Kingdom and it
    was in her best interests to stay in the United  Kingdom.  Her  parents
    should therefore also permitted to remain in the United  Kingdom  (para
    18).

13. The circumstances relied upon in relation to the third  appellant  were
    summarised by the judge at para 18 as follows:

         "18.     ... She could not return to India because  she  could  not
             speak Hindi, the language used at  school.  In  addition,  she
             could  not  speak  Punjabi,  the  language  of  her   parents.
             Furthermore, she would not be able to re-integrate herself  in
             India, lacking Hindi and Punjabi. Moreover,  she  had  a  rich
             private life having developed a level of ties and  attachments
             outside the family unit. If she had to return  to  India,  she
             would be adversely affected educationally. She was in year  10
             and was immersed in her GCSEs...."

14. At para 52, the judge said that the central strand of  the  appellants'
    case was that they could not return  to  India  because  of  the  third
    appellant's lack of Hindi, which they  said  would  cause  considerable
    difficulties in her education.

15. The judge said at para 52 that she found the evidence of the appellants
    inconsistent  and  implausible  on  the  following  issues:  the  third
    appellant's language capability, the second appellant's work history in
    India and on the question of when the parents formed the  intention  to
    stay in the United Kingdom.

16. The judge's unchallenged findings of fact may be summarised as follows:



    i)     On the subject of the third appellant's language capability, the
         evidence of the first and second appellants  was  inconsistent  and
         the evidence of the uncle merited less weight (para 53). The  judge
         rejected the evidence that the third  appellant  could  only  speak
         English. She found that the third appellant spoke Hindi at home and
         at school until the age of seven years  six  months  and  that  she
         continued to speak Hindi at home once in the  United  Kingdom.  She
         rejected the third appellant's evidence that she  could  not  speak
         any language other than English (para 70).

    ii)    Having considered at paras 66 and 68 the evidence of  the  third
         appellant's  performance in studying Spanish and French and  having
         considered at para 69 the third appellant's evidence that  she  had
         only just started to learn English before her arrival in the United
         Kingdom but was able to speak,  understand,  read  and  write  good
         English by being  completely  immersed  in  school  in  the  United
         Kingdom  the judge found (para 71) that  the  third  appellant  has
         good ability as a linguist  and  so  could  improve  her  Hindi  if
         required for written work because she had shown that she  learns  a
         language well by immersion.

    iii)   At para 71, the judge noted that the second appellant  had  been
         educated for two years in India. She said that no reason  had  been
         given why the third appellant could not continue to be educated  in
         Hindi in India on return.

    iv)    At para 86, the judge found that the third  appellant  would  be
         able to adapt to living in India having lived there for seven years
         and her parents would be well placed to help her adapt.  The  judge
         also found that the third appellant's ability in "the  language  of
         India" met the requirement in factor d. of para 11.2.4 of the IDIs,
         i.e. she was  able  to  communicate  competently  with  sympathetic
         interlocutors or to achieve this within a reasonable time period.

    v)     At para 72, the judge found that the third appellant was in good
         health and is cared  for  by  her  parents  without  assistance  or
         reliance upon anyone else.

    vi)    The judge found that the third appellant  has  a  good  academic
         performance and behaviour. She found that there was no evidence  of
         extraordinary talents or unusual  involvements  inside  or  outside
         school (para 91). Her reasons in this respect are given at paras 65-
         68. She said that there was no evidence of  the  third  appellant's
         private life outside her family apart from the fact  that  she  had
         attended primary school for four years  and  secondary  school  for
         three  years  and  two  terms.  The  judge  found  that  the  third
         appellant's private life amounted to little more  than  that  which
         would inevitably arise after a period of seven years in the  United
         Kingdom and that the third appellant has  an  unremarkable  private
         life. The first and second appellants also had unremarkable private
         lives.

    vii)   On the subject of the second appellant's work history, the judge
         noted that the first appellant  said  in  oral  evidence  that  the
         second appellant had  had  a  car  business  in  India  before  the
         marriage in 2001, whereas the second appellant denied it completely
         but, when confronted  with  the  second  appellant's  evidence,  he
         became evasive and appeared to be playing for time. The judge found
         that the second appellant had a longstanding car business in  India
         which had been in existence for at least eight years (para 57).

    viii)  The judge also found the second appellant evasive when asked why
         he could not find a job in India (para 58).  At  para  97(vi),  the
         judge found that the first and second appellants could re-establish
         themselves  in  India  and  help  the  third   appellant   in   her
         reintegration. At para 97(vii), the judge  noted  that  the  second
         appellant had said that his parents could support his  family.  The
         judge said that this would help tide  the  family  over  until  the
         first and second appellants re-established themselves.

    ix)    The judge found the evidence of the first and second  appellants
         about the timing of their decision to stay in  the  United  Kingdom
         and the reasons given for it incredible. Her reasons are  given  at
         paras 59-63. She found that the first and second  appellants  never
         had the intention to return to India. She found it highly revealing
         that within a few weeks of arriving in the United Kingdom in August
         2009, the second appellant had wound up his business in  India.  At
         para 97(iv) and in connection with  the  proportionality  balancing
         exercise, the judge said that she  found  that  the  parents  never
         intended to return to India and that they deliberately waited until
         the daughter was close to seven year's continuous residence in  the
         United Kingdom before making their application in August 2015.

    x)     At para 73,  the  judge  accepted  that  the  parents  and  some
         siblings of the first and second  appellants  had  left  India  for
         good. However, as she had found them to be evasive  and  less  than
         truthful on important points in these appeals, she did not rule out
         that they may have some family  members  left  in  India  and  some
         friends.

17. In his submissions, Mr Malik focused on paras 84,  86  and  91  of  the
    judge's decision. However, it is necessary to set  out  almost  all  of
    paras 51-99, which read:

         "Findings of Fact and of Credibility

         51.      I have had the opportunity of hearing direct evidence from
             the Appellants and from the outset I must state that I did not
             find their evidence entirely  credible  about  the  daughter's
             ability in Hindi; it was abundantly clear that they  were  not
             giving the Tribunal the full picture. I consider compendiously
             the evidence of the First, Second and Third Appellant.

         52.      I find the evidence of the Appellants is inconsistent  and
             implausible on the Third Appellant's language  capability,  on
             the Second Appellant's work history in India and on  when  the
             parents formed the intention to stay in the  UK.  The  central
             strand of their case is  that  they  cannot  return  to  India
             because of the daughter's lack of  Hindi,  which  would  cause
             considerable  difficulties  in  her  education.  I  make   the
             following findings of fact in relation to the  credibility  of
             the evidence.

         53.      First, I consider the subject  of  the  Third  Appellant's
             language capability.  The  First  Appellant  said  that  [sic]
             language spoken with the Third Appellant at home in India  was
             Hindi. She was adamant that the language spoken at home in the
             UK was Punjabi not  Hindi.  She  could  not  explain  why  the
             language used at home had switched on moving from India to the
             UK. Secondly, her account did not  accord  with  that  of  the
             Second Appellant. He was clear that  Hindi  was  the  language
             spoken at home in the UK. I am aware that the Uncle said  that
             Punjabi was spoken in the home and he could not speak Hindi. I
             place less weight on the Uncle's evidence in this  respect  as
             given that the parents could  speak  Punjabi,  it  would  make
             sense for them to speak Punjabi in his presence. He would  not
             have been in the home all the time and  would  not  know  what
             language was spoken when he was not there.

         54.      The First Appellant said that she spoke Punjabi  with  her
             young son. She was not able to explain why she spoke to him in
             Punjabi when she had  spoken  to  her  daughter  at  the  same
             (young) age in Hindi. I find therefore that Hindi is spoken in
             the home in the UK.

         55.      The First and Second Appellant were  insistent  that  they
             spoke only in English to the Third Appellant at home. If  this
             were correct, this would mean  that  the  Appellant  would  be
             regularly excluded from conversations in the home. I find that
             regular exclusion in this way could have an adverse effect  on
             a young girl and a teenager as the Third Appellant now is. The
             First and Second Appellant were not able to give  a  plausible
             explanation of why they would do this to their daughter.  They
             blamed television and school.

         56.      If I had accepted that the First and Second Appellant  had
             not spoken Hindi to the Third Appellant in the UK and had only
             spoken to her in the English (which I do not accept), I  would
             have found that they had deliberately done this  in  order  to
             minimise her proficiency in Hindi and thereby to construct  an
             argument that she had lost her Hindi to such an extent that it
             could not be revived.

         57.      I now turn to the Second Appellant's job history in India.
             The First Appellant  had  made  a  passing  reference  in  her
             witness statement on which she was probed. She  then  revealed
             that the Second Appellant had had  a  car  business  in  India
             since before their marriage  in  2001.  The  Second  Appellant
             denied this completely. I note his manner in  answering  these
             questions  was  distinctly  evasive.  It  took  a  number   of
             questions to elicit any coherent information about his alleged
             work  history.  I  prefer  the  oral  evidence  of  the  First
             Appellant because she would  appear  to  have  been  taken  by
             surprise with the questions about the meaning of  "winding  up
             everything" and I find that she spoke without  thinking.  With
             regard to the Second Appellant, I find that he appeared to  be
             playing for time trying to produce a  picture  which  had  not
             existed. He first denied working  at  all.  When  pressed,  he
             presented himself as a low level  worker  working  irregularly
             first delivering second hand cars  and  afterwards  delivering
             paper. He could give no reason as to why he knew nothing about
             the paper business; he had  merely  stopped  speaking  to  the
             friend who allegedly owned it. He gave no  details  about  the
             car delivery business. I find that he had a  longstanding  car
             business, which had been  in  existence  for  at  least  eight
             years. There was no  reason  for  the  wife  to  invent  this.
             Furthermore, given the husband's reference to second  cars,  I
             find that it is more likely than not  that  his  car  business
             involved buying and selling second hand cars.

         58.      I also find the Second Appellant was evasive in  answering
             why he could not find a  job  in  India.  He  claimed  not  to
             understand the question and when asked again, claimed  not  to
             know.  I  find  the  Second  Appellant  to  be   a   competent
             individual, one who owned and ran his own business.  There  is
             no plausible reason why he could not understand such a  simple
             question or know anything about the job  situation  in  India,
             having lived there for 34 years.

         59.      Finally, I  turn  to  the  First  and  Second  Appellant's
             intention to stay and timing. The First  Appellant  said  that
             the purpose of coming to the UK was to gain qualifications and
             to speak good English in order to get a  good  job  in  India.
             Having obtained an HND and BA and improved her English,  there
             was no clear reason why  the  Appellants  did  not  return  in
             January 2013. I accept that the  First  Appellant  would  have
             liked to study for a post graduate  diploma  but  on  her  own
             evidence she had already achieved her work related goals  with
             her BA.

         60.      I further accept that the First Appellant applied  for  an
             extension of her LIR to undertake the postgraduate diploma  in
             May 2013 then June 2013 and the outcome of her appeals was not
             finally concluded until July 2015. Nevertheless, if  she  were
             being consistent in her avowed goals, at that point she  would
             have returned to India with her family on the realisation that
             she would not be obtaining a  post-graduate  qualification  in
             the UK. I find also  that  the  First  and  Second  Appellants
             showed considerable determination to  stay.  Even  though  the
             decision from the First-tier Tribunal made it clear that  they
             had failed on two factual  grounds  (incomplete  documentation
             and insufficient funds at the date of application)  under  the
             Points Based System (which is a strict system) and  that  they
             had no right of appeal, they applied twice for  permission  to
             appeal the decision. I do not seek to criticise them for this;
             I make  this  observation  because  it  shows  their  absolute
             determination to stay in the UK (to which I refer to below).

         61.      Furthermore, the First Appellant admitted  that  once  she
             had become pregnant (in early 2015) she had  no  time  and  no
             intention  to  do  any  more  studying.  On  that  basis,   if
             consistent with her stated goals, they would have  left  as  a
             family in  early  2015,  as  soon  as  arrangements  could  be
             reasonably made.

         62.      The First Appellant was evasive about when she had decided
             not to return to India. Her answers varied  between  when  her
             son was born (October 2015), no date  and  when  her  daughter
             started her GSCEs (September 2016). The Second Appellant  said
             that they planned to return when their daughter had  completed
             her studies. He did not indicate what he meant. On  the  basis
             that his  daughter  said  she  hoped  and  intended  to  study
             Medicine in the UK,  the  Second  Appellant  would  have  been
             anticipating staying  until  at  least  2025.  At  that  point
             someone of the Third Appellant's age would have completed  her
             second MB and be about to undertake her F1 year.

         63.      I find that the Second and Third Appellants never had  the
             intention to return. This is why they could not easily come up
             with a date when they decided to stay and  did  not  give  the
             same date. This is also why the business was sold. I  find  it
             highly revealing that within a few weeks of arriving in the UK
             (in August 2009),  the  Second  Appellant  had  wound  up  his
             business. There is no evidence to suggest that it  was  not  a
             viable business and could not have continued  to  provide  the
             Second Appellant with a livelihood in years to come. The First
             Appellant said that the business had to be  wound  up  because
             there was no-one to run it. As I  find  the  evidence  of  the
             First Appellant lacks credibility in a number of key areas,  I
             do not  accept  that.  In  any  event,  I  find  that  if  the
             Appellants had genuinely been intending to return after  three
             to four years of studying (as they claim), I  find  that  they
             would have made serious enquiries about finding  a  deputy  to
             act in their absence or even a partner. They would  have  been
             keen to find a way to keep the business alive ready for  their
             return. There was no evidence of any such enquiries.

         64.      Turning now to the issues  in  the  appeals,  I  make  the
             following findings of fact.

         65.      I have been provided with school reports, certificates and
             other documents from the Third Appellant's current school. The
             most recent school reports are for the three terms in each  of
             Years 7 and 8. Although the Third Appellant is in Year 10  and
             could have provided reports for Year 9 and for  at  least  the
             autumn term of Year 10, these were not supplied.  I  therefore
             base my conclusions about the Third Appellant's abilities  and
             performance on her end of year reports for Year 7  (July  2014
             [1001) and for Year 8 (June 2015 [111]).

         66.      In the Year 7 report, the Third Appellant  met  or  nearly
             met her end of year progress targets in all her  subjects.  In
             Spanish and French however she exceeded her targets such  that
             she was four  sublevels  ahead.  I  note  that  a  student  is
             expected to progress by three sublevels in an  academic  year.
             In English she was five  sublevels  behind  her  end  of  year
             target. Her reading age was 15 years 10 months and  she  would
             have been 12 years 5 months at the time.

         67.      In the Year 8 report, the Third Appellant met her  end  of
             year targets  in  all  subjects  including  Spanish  save  for
             Religious Education and Physical Education. In  addition,  she
             was four sublevels behind  her  target  in  English.  She  was
             significantly ahead of her targets in Technology and Art.  Her
             reading age was 16 years 1 month and her actual age 13 years 4
             months.

         68.      From these reports I make the following findings of  fact.
             First the Third Appellant excelled in languages in Year 7  and
             continued to make good progress in Spanish in Year 8. She thus
             has a demonstrated ability in writing, reading,  speaking  and
             understanding foreign languages. Secondly, even though she did
             not make expected progress in English, her achievement at  the
             end of year 8 (6b) was at the same level as her achievement in
             Mathematics and  Science  with  6b  being  the  highest  level
             attained in any subject. I find  therefore  that  expectations
             for English were set higher than in any other subject (at  7c)
             (Mathematics and Science being set at 6b) and it is misleading
             to look at her progress score at the end. In  any  event,  the
             failure to make expected progress in English  did  not  affect
             results on other subjects. Furthermore,  her  reading  ability
             was  very  good,  being  at  least  two  years  ahead  of  her
             chronological   age.   Thirdly,   the   Third   Appellant   is
             academically  a  good  student  overall  but  not  at  present
             outstanding.

         69.      With regard to her aptitude for  languages,  I  note  also
             that on her own evidence she  was  able  to  learn  to  speak,
             understand, read and write good English by being  immersed  in
             school. Before arrival, she had only  just  started  to  learn
             English.

         70.      Taking all of this into account, I  find  that  the  Third
             Appellant spoke Hindi at home and at school until the age of 7
             years 6 months. She continued to speak Hindi at home  once  in
             the UK. I am aware that the  Third  Appellant  herself  denied
             being able to speak any language but English. I do not  accept
             her evidence for the following reasons. She is still at an age
             where she would wish to please her parents and  do  what  they
             ask and she knows that her parents are determined to  stay  in
             the UK. She also very much wishes to stay herself  and  so  in
             that way, her own objectives are in tune with her parents.

         71.      Prior to coming to the UK, she was educated for two  years
             in Hindi and no reason  has  been  given  why  she  could  not
             continue to be educated in Hindi in India on return (it  being
             one of the languages of education). She has good ability as  a
             linguist and  so  could  improve  her  Hindi  should  that  be
             required for written work. She has also shown that she  learns
             a language well through immersion.

         72.      The Third Appellant is in good health. She is cared for by
             her parents without assistance or reliance upon anyone else.

         73.      The First and Second Appellants were concerned to make  it
             clear that they had no relatives or  friends  left  in  India.
             Rather their parents and siblings (with the exception of  Mrs.
             [K]) had emigrated to the USA or  to  Canada.  I  accept  that
             their parents and some siblings have emigrated and  thus  left
             India for good. Nevertheless,  I  have  found  the  First  and
             Second Appellant to be  evasive  and  less  than  truthful  on
             important points in these appeals. I do not rule out therefore
             that they have some family members left in India and  friends.
             In any event, the First and Second Appellants came to  the  UK
             without any friends and with few relatives. They say that they
             have made good friends in the UK. I find that they  could  use
             the same skills and attributes to make new friends in India.

         Section 55

         74.      I consider the section 55 duty. In doing so I bear in mind
             the decision in  TO  and  Others  (section  55  duty)  Nigeria
             [2014]1 UKUT 00517 which considers  the  section  55  duty  in
             detail. As explained in TO, the section 55 duty was considered
             by the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) [20111 UKSC4 in which it
             was held  that  the  best  interests  of  the  child  must  be
             considered first when considering issues under  Article  8  of
             the European Convention on  Human  Rights  ("ECHR")  and  that
             although this was not a factor which would  prevail  over  all
             other considerations it must rank higher than any other.

         75.      I bear in mind the requirement in section  55(3)  to  have
             regard to statutory guidance. The key points of this  guidance
             were set out in TO. The most important point in the context of
             this case is that "ethnic identity, language, religion, faith,
             gender and disability are taken into account when working with
             a child and their family." Given the age of the child in  this
             case there is scope for considering the child's own wishes.

         76.      I am aware of the case of EV (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ
             874 in which it was held that the need to maintain immigration
             control can outweigh a child's best interests.

         Section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
         ("the 2002 Act") and MA (Pakistan) and Others v  SSHD  [2016]  EWCA
         Civ 705

         77.      I am aware of section 117B(6)  provides  that  in  a  case
             where a  person  is  not  liable  to  deportation  the  public
             interest does not require the person's removal where they have
             a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying  child
             (i.e. a child who has lived continuously  in  the  UK  for  at
             least 7 years) and it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the
             child to leave the United Kingdom. There is  no  dispute  that
             the parents have a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with
             the Third Appellant their daughter.

         78.      I am also aware of MA (Pakistan) which deals with the case
             of persons exercising a parental role who may be  entitled  to
             stay with their child in the UK in  circumstances  where  they
             would not qualify for leave in their own right,  independently
             of their status as parents. They may be able to  "piggy  back"
             on the rights of the child; the child  must  be  a  qualifying
             child in order for the provision in Section 117B(6) "to  bite"
             [�2 in MA (Pakistan)]. In considering the question in  Section
             117B(6) of whether it was reasonable to expect  the  child  to
             leave the UK, under MM (Uganda) v SSHD [2016]  EWCA  Civ  617,
             courts were obliged to take  into  account  the  wider  public
             interest considerations including the conduct and  immigration
             history of the parents.  Furthermore,  under  MM  (Uganda)  it
             might be reasonable to require the child to leave where  there
             were good cogent reasons (head note �1).

         79.      I remind myself also that under MA  (Pakistan)  "the  fact
             that a child had been in the UK  for  seven  years  should  be
             given  significant  weight  in  the  proportionality  exercise
             because  of  its  relevance  to  determining  the  nature  and
             strength of the child's best interests and as  it  established
             as a starting point that leave should be granted unless  there
             were powerful reasons to the contrary".

         80.      Mr. Grigg has also provided me with a more recent Court of
             Appeal case, AM (Pakistan) & Others v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 180
             and Kaur (children's best interests/public interest interface)
             [2017] UKUT 00014 (IAC) which is an Upper Tribunal decision of
             the President. I find that neither of these cases changes  the
             position which I must adopt in the light of MA (Pakistan) (see
             �s 21 - 23 in AM (Pakistan)).

         Immigration Directorate Instruction Family  Migration  ("the  IDI")
         and the determination of the reasonableness criterion

         81.      I am aware of the IDI in which it is recognised that after
             a seven year period of continuous residence children start  to
             "put down roots and integrate into  life  in  the  UK  to  the
             extent  that  being  required  to  leave   the   UK   may   be
             unreasonable. The longer the child has resided in the  UK  the
             more the balance will begin to swing  in  terms  of  it  being
             unreasonable to expect the child to leave the  UK  and  strong
             reasons will be required  in  order  to  refuse  a  case  with
             continuous residence of more than 7 years" [11.2.4].

         82.      The IDI identifies factors a - f which are  likely  to  be
             relevant considerations.

         83.      In relation to factor a. the  Third  Appellant  would  not
             experience a significant risk to her  health  if  returned  to
             India. She is in essentially good health.

         84.      In relation to factor b. it is in her  best  interests  to
             remain with her parents. I accept that the Appellants consider
             that it is in her best interests to remain in the UK  for  the
             sake of the  superior  educational  and  career  opportunities
             offered (which could lead to a career in medicine in the  UK).
             I do not accept this; the IDI  makes  it  clear  (as  does  EV
             (Philippines)) that the better quality of education  available
             in  the  UK  cannot  be  relied  upon  except  in  exceptional
             circumstances. I also acknowledge that Mr. Grigg refers to the
             need for continuity rather than upheaval at a sensitive  stage
             of her education, the Third Appellant being in the first  year
             of GCSEs. If the Appellants were so concerned about disruption
             to the Third Appellant's education at a critical stage, it was
             open to them, once the First Appellant realised that  she  was
             not going to study again (in early 2015), to  apply  then  for
             LTR on the basis of the Third Appellant's private life in  the
             hope of a resolution before much of the GSCE first year course
             had been  covered.  I  note  also  that  the  Appellants  have
             produced nothing about the public examination system in  India
             (that is the equivalent of GCSEs  etc),  the  syllabi  or  the
             Indian school year to show that the Third Appellant  would  be
             significantly disadvantaged.  For  example,  they  could  have
             dealt [sic] whether there is a difference between  syllabi  in
             the two countries for example in English, Mathematics and  the
             Sciences. They could have approached some schools to  ask  the
             head teacher whether the Third Appellant could  join  her  age
             group without difficulty without or  with  extra  coaching  or
             would have to go down a school year.

         85.      In relation to  factor  c.  she  has  a  small  number  of
             relatives in this country; her maternal aunt and her  father's
             uncle and aunt. There was no evidence that  she  is  dependent
             upon or requires the support of  any  of  these  wider  family
             members in the UK.

         86.      In relation to factor  d.  the  Third  Appellant  and  her
             parents are citizens of India and would be able to  enjoy  the
             full rights of being citizens in India. The First, Second  and
             Third Appellants lived in India respectively until the ages of
             30, 34 and 7 before coming to  the  UK.  The  Third  Appellant
             would be able to adapt having lived there for seven years  and
             her parents would be well placed to help  her  adapt.  I  have
             already found that the First and  Second  Appellant  may  have
             relatives and friends in India and have the  ability  to  make
             new friends. The parents  have  relevant  cultural  ties  with
             India, having lived there well into  their  adulthood,  living
             with another family from India in their  shared  accommodation
             and having continued to speak Hindi  at  home.  If  the  Third
             Appellant has not been exposed to Indian culture and  cultural
             norms, which I doubt, I find that this would have been part of
             a deliberate policy by the parents to  diminish  her  cultural
             ties and improve their immigration case.  In  terms  of  being
             able to speak, read and write in the language  of  India,  the
             parents can. I note that the requirement is not fluency but an
             ability to be able to communicate competently with sympathetic
             interlocutors or to achieve  this  within  a  reasonable  time
             period. I find that the Third Appellant meets this requirement
             basing that conclusion upon my findings above.

         87.      I find that there are no other relevant  factors  to  take
             into  account,  for  example  under  "e  -  country   specific
             information..." or "f  -  specific  factors".  In  conclusion,
             taking account of factors a - d above, I find that it would be
             reasonable to expect the Third Appellant to leave the  UK  and
             to return to India.

         Article 8

         87.      I turn next to consider Article 8. The correct approach to
             Article 8 was set out in the case of R (on the application  of
             Oludoyi and others) -v- SSHD (Article 8  -  MM  (Lebanon)  and
             Nagre) [2014] UKUT 00539. In this case it was held  that  when
             considering whether Article 8 should be considered outside the
             context of the Immigration Rules what is required is  for  the
             Tribunal to look at the evidence to see if there was  anything
             which has  not  already  been  adequately  considered  in  the
             context of the Immigration Rules and which  could  lead  to  a
             successful Article 8 claim.

         88.      I also bear in mind the very recent  case  of  R  (on  the
             application of Agyarko)  v  SSHD  [2017]  UKSC  11.  Where  an
             applicant does not meet the requirement of  the  Rules,  leave
             can  be  granted   outside   the   Rules   where   exceptional
             circumstances apply. I find  that  there  are  no  exceptional
             circumstances to warrant consideration of  a  grant  of  leave
             outside the Rules.

         89.      Mr. Grigg argued that the length of time during which  the
             Third Appellant had been in the UK, the critical stage of  her
             education (1st year of GCSE  course),  her  total  absence  of
             Hindi, the failure of the First Appellant's  applications  for
             FLR as a student all being a near miss and the  delay  on  the
             part of the Home Office constituted exceptional circumstances.

         90.      If Mr Grigg  is  correct  that  these  aspects  amount  to
             exceptional  circumstances,  I  make  the  following  findings
             applying the five stage test in Razgar.

         91.      By way of preliminary, I find  that  the  Appellants  have
             family life together. I find that the Third  Appellant  has  a
             good academic performance and behaviour. There is  however  no
             evidence of extraordinary talents or unusual  achievements  or
             involvements inside or outside school. In sum,  there  was  no
             evidence of the Third Appellant's  private  life  outside  her
             family apart from the  fact  that  she  had  attended  primary
             school for four years and secondary school for 3 years and two
             terms. I was satisfied  that  her  private  life  amounted  to
             little more than that which would  inevitably  arise  after  a
             period of 7 years in the UK and  I  therefore  find  that  the
             Third Appellant has an unremarkable private life. I have  been
             given nothing about the First and Second  Appellants'  private
             life and I find accordingly that they too have an unremarkable
             private life.

         92.      With regard to the first aspect under Razgar, ...

         93.      Secondly, ...

         94.      Thirdly, ...

         95.      Fourthly, ...

         96.      With regard to the fifth aspect under Razgar,  I  consider
             the facts which will determine  whether  the  interference  is
             proportionate to the  legitimate  aim  sought.  This  involves
             striking a fair balance between the Appellants' rights and the
             interests of the community  at  large.  I  bear  in  mind,  as
             already explained, that in performing the necessary  balancing
             exercise the best interests of the Third Appellant as a  child
             had to rank higher than any other consideration.

             (i) Section 117B(3) is a factor which operates so as to  weigh
                  against the Appellants' private  lives  in  the  balancing
                  exercise. I am  required  to  consider  whether  they  are
                  financially independent. They are not at present  and  are
                  reliant upon contributions from their relatives. The First
                  and Second Appellant have not been permitted to work since
                  2013 and the Third Appellant is a minor. I  bear  in  mind
                  however that the mother and father worked respectively  as
                  a carer and milkman when allowed to work  but  I  have  no
                  information about their level of earnings. I bear in  mind
                  also that they have not been dependant upon the  taxpayer,
                  relying on their relatives.

             (ii)      Section  117B(2):  they  speak  English.  Whilst  an
                  appellant can obtain no positive right to a grant of leave
                  to remain from the level of her fluency in  English  under
                  Sections  117B(2)  (AM  (S117B)  Malawi  [20151  UKUT  260
                  (IAC)), this factor  does  not  operate  so  as  to  weigh
                  against their private lives in the balancing exercise

             (iii)     Section 117B(4): little weight can  be  attached  to
                  the mother  and  father's  private  life  which  has  been
                  established by them when their immigration status  in  the
                  UK has been precarious. This is not in dispute. The  Third
                  Appellant (together with the First and Second  Appellants)
                  had only ever had limited leave to remain  and  the  First
                  Appellant's own evidence was that she expected  that  they
                  would have to return to India. I am aware that  Mr.  Grigg
                  has argued  under  the  most  recent  case  law  that  the
                  daughter as a minor cannot be responsible for the  actions
                  of her parents and as such, Section 117B(4) should not  be
                  a factor counting against her in the  balancing  exercise.
                  MA (Pakistan) did not  however  depart  from  MM  (Uganda)
                  [�45] and therefore I may have regard to  the  mother  and
                  father's immigration history in considering  the  question
                  of reasonableness.

             (iv)      Section 117B(6): I bear in mind the principles in MA
                  (Pakistan) (and subsequent more  recent  case  law)  which
                  will inform my analysis of the effect of Section  117B(6).
                  I  therefore  need  to  consider  whether  it   would   be
                  reasonable for the daughter to leave the UK as at the date
                  of the hearing, she had been in the UK for at least  seven
                  years continuously.  I  found  above  that  this  question
                  hinged on all the factors  set  out  in  the  IDI  and  in
                  particular the daughter's best interests and  whether  the
                  daughter can speak and understand Hindi and read and write
                  in Hindi. I have found that it would be reasonable for the
                  daughter to leave the UK for the reasons set out above.

         97.      I further bear in mind that the mandated process does  not
             require the Tribunal to dismiss the  Appellant's  appeal.  The
             Section 117 factors constitute some but not all of the factors
             to be taken into account  in  the  proportionality  assessment
             (Dube (ss.117A - 117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC)). I find that  the
             balance goes  against  the  Appellants  as  a  result  of  the
             following factors:-

             (i) Failure to satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules;  this  factor
                  operates so as to weigh against their private life in  the
                  balancing exercise;

             (ii)      The daughter's best interests: she is 15 years  old.
                  She has no special needs  or  health  conditions.  I  have
                  assessed this as part of  the  assessment  of  whether  it
                  would be reasonable for to expect her to leave the UK.

             (iii)     The lack of credibility in the evidence of the First
                  and Second Appellant: I set out above in  what  areas  and
                  ways their evidence lacked credibility.

             (iv)      Delay: the mother  and  father  (together  with  the
                  daughter) have been in  the  UK  unlawfully  for  over  3�
                  years. I bear in mind the mother and father's responses to
                  the question about the  date  when  they  decided  not  to
                  return to India (and thus to make another  application  to
                  regularise their immigration status). In this  connection,
                  they referred to  the  daughter's  education,  the  father
                  indicating  that  it  was  at  the  commencement  of   the
                  daughter's GCSE courses. I found above  that  the  parents
                  never intended  to  return.  Moreover,  they  deliberately
                  waited until  the  daughter  was  close  to  seven  years'
                  continuous  residence  in  the  UK  before  making   their
                  application in August 2015. From their experience  of  the
                  refusal of the application for LTR as a  student  in  2013
                  and the appeals (which continued for two years) they would
                  have known that by the date of the hearing, their daughter
                  was very likely to have reached the seven  year  milestone
                  (9 August 2016). They would have also have  known  of  the
                  significance  of  that  milestone,  having  been   legally
                  advised throughout.

             (v) The son's best interests: he is very  young  (being  under
                  two years of age) and  has  no  special  needs  or  health
                  conditions.

             (vi)      Ability to obtain  work  in  India:  the  First  and
                  Second Appellants could re-establish themselves  in  India
                  and help the Third Appellant in her  re-integration.  Both
                  the First and Second Appellants speak Punjabi  and  Hindi,
                  the  First  Appellant  has  obtained   a   post   graduate
                  qualification and enhanced her English capability  in  the
                  UK which in her view would assist in obtaining a good job.
                  In addition, she has had work experience in  the  UK.  The
                  Second Appellant has also worked in the UK,  and  had  run
                  his own business in India. They would be both be  able  to
                  find work in India, drawing on  their  qualifications  and
                  previous experience. No reason was given  why  they  could
                  not work in India.

             (v) Financial Support from the Second Appellant's parents: the
                  Second Appellant agreed that his parents could support his
                  family. This would help whilst they  were  job-hunting  to
                  tide them over until they had established  themselves  and
                  enable them to obtain rental accommodation at the outset.

         98.      I find therefore that there is a public  interest  in  the
             Appellants' removal beyond  the  general  public  interest  in
             effective immigration control.

         99.      Given the above findings I find that the wife, husband and
             daughter (the First, Second and  Third  Appellants)  have  not
             discharged the burden of proof  to  show  that  their  removal
             would be disproportionate to the legitimate public end  sought
             to be achieved and I find that they have  not  discharged  the
             burden of proof such that their removal would cause the United
             Kingdom to be in breach of  our  obligations  under  the  1950
             Convention as regards to Article 8 thereof and therefore their
             appeals can only fail."

Submissions

18. In relation to grounds 1 and 2, Mr Malik relied upon paras (3) and  (4)
    of the judicial head-note in Kaur (children's best interests  /  public
    interest interface) [2017]  UKUT  00014  (IAC).  In  Kaur,  Mr  Justice
    McCloskey, the then President, said that: (i)  in  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise, the best interests of a child must be  assessed  in
    isolation from other factors, such as parental misconduct; and (ii) The
    best interests  assessment  should  normally  be  carried  out  at  the
    beginning of the balancing exercise.

19. Mr Malik submitted that this meant the judge should have considered the
    Article 8 claim  outside  the  Rules  following  the  following  staged
    process: first, consider the best interests of the third  appellant  at
    the very beginning of the balancing exercise.  In  addition,  the  best
    interests of  the  third  appellant  should  have  been  considered  in
    isolation from the conduct of the parents. Second, consider the  public
    interest. Third, consider whether the  public  interest  overrides  the
    best interests of the child. By considering the conduct of the  parents
    in assessing the best interests of the third appellant, the  judge  set
    the bar on the third appellant's side of the  scale,  insofar  as  this
    embodies her best interests, too low,  so  that  it  was  more  readily
    overridden by public interest consideration in the  balancing  exercise
    in relation to proportionality.

20. Mr Malik submitted that, whilst paras 74-76 of the judge's decision are
    under the heading "section 55" and paras 78-80 refer, inter alia, to MA
    (Pakistan) and the fact  that  significance  should  be  given  in  the
    proportionality exercise to the fact that a  child  has  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom continuously for a period of at least seven  years,  the
    judge merely quoted authorities at paras 74-76 and 78-80. She  did  not
    assess the evidence.

21. Mr Malik submitted that the judge's assessment of the third appellant's
    best interests began at para 84, where she began by saying that it  was
    in the third appellant's best interests to remain with her parents.  Mr
    Malik submitted that it was clear that the judge had taken into account
    the conduct of the parents in  assessing  the  third  appellant's  best
    interests because she said as follows at paras 84 and 86:

         "84.     ... If the Appellants were so concerned  about  disruption
             to the Third Appellant's education at a critical stage, it was
             open to them, once the First Appellant realised that  she  was
             not going to study again (in early 2015), to  apply  then  for
             LTR on the basis of the Third Appellant's private life in  the
             hope of a resolution before much of the GSCE first year course
             had been covered....

         86.      ... If the Third Appellant has not been exposed to  Indian
             culture and cultural norms, which I doubt, I  find  that  this
             would have been part of a deliberate policy by the parents  to
             diminish her  cultural  ties  and  improve  their  immigration
             case...."

22. In relation to ground 3, Mr Malik referred me  to  para  91  where  the
    judge said that "there was no  evidence  of  extraordinary  talents  or
    unusual achievements or  involvements  inside  or  outside  school"  in
    respect of the third appellant and paragraph  96(iv)  where  the  judge
    said that she had in mind the principles in  MA  (Pakistan).  Mr  Malik
    submitted that, notwithstanding that the judge referred at para  74  to
    the principle in MA (Pakistan), her approach was inconsistent with  the
    principle in MA (Pakistan) that significant weight should be  given  to
    the fact that a child has lived in the United Kingdom continuously  for
    at least seven years and that the starting point was that leave  should
    be granted unless there were  powerful  reasons  to  the  contrary.  He
    submitted that she did not in fact recognise the principle or apply it.



23. Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted  that  the  judge  had  not  taken  into
    account the conduct of the parents in assessing the best  interests  of
    the third appellant. In relation to the extract  from  para  84  relied
    upon by Mr Malik in his submission that the judge had so erred in  law,
    Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that the judge was merely assessing  the
    credibility of the first and second appellants' evidence.  The  extract
    from para 86 was a throwaway comment by the judge which is  immaterial,
    in Ms Brocklesby-Weller's submission.  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  submitted
    that the judge had made a wealth of findings in her decision in a child-
    centric way and reached  the  conclusion  that  it  was  in  the  third
    appellant's best interests to remain with her parents.

24. Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that, contrary to ground  3,  the  judge
    had applied  the  principle  in  MA  (Pakistan).  She  referred  to  it
    specifically at paras 79 and 81 and directed herself  correctly.  There
    was little more that she could have done.

25. Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that the judge's observation at para  91
    that "there  was  no  evidence  of  extraordinary  talents  or  unusual
    achievements or involvements inside or outside school" should  be  read
    together with her earlier findings, in particular, para 84,  where  she
    said that the  appellants  "have  produced  nothing  about  the  public
    examination system in India (that is the equivalent of GCSEs etc),  the
    syllabi or the Indian school year to  show  that  the  Third  Appellant
    would be significantly disadvantaged."

26. In response and in relation to ground 3, Mr Malik submitted  that  para
    87 shows that the judge's assessment of whether it was  reasonable  for
    the third appellant to leave the United  Kingdom  was  limited  to  the
    factors in para 11.2.4 of the IDIs, i.e. her assessment at paras 83-86.
    In other words, the judge concluded that  it  was  reasonable  for  the
    third appellant to leave the United Kingdom for the  four  reasons  she
    gave at paras 83-86. Nowhere at paras 83-86 did the judge recognise the
    significance of the length of the third appellant's  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom.

27. Mr Malik submitted that the judge should have explained  what  powerful
    reasons there were for saying that the public interest  outweighed  the
    significant weight to be given to the third  appellant's  residence  of
    over seven years.

28. Mr Malik submitted that the judge considered the balancing exercise  in
    relation to whether it is reasonable for the third appellant  to  leave
    the United Kingdom at paras 84-86 and she considered her best interests
    at para 84-86. It is clear from paras 84-86  (he  submitted)  that  she
    took into account the conduct of the parents in her assessment  of  the
    third appellant's best interests.

29. Mr Malik asked me to record the fact that he reserves his  position  in
    relation to this appeal in view of the fact that the Supreme Court will
    be deciding whether MA (Pakistan) was correctly decided.

30. I reserved my decision, having agreed with Mr Malik and Ms  Brocklesby-
    Weller that, if I were to conclude that the judge had materially  erred
    in law and given the unchallenged findings of fact by  the  judge,  the
    following paragraphs would stand: 51-73,  91,  96(i),  96(ii),  96(iii)
    (except  for  the  last  sentence  beginning:  "I  am  aware  that   Mr
    Grigg..."), 97(iii), 97(iv) and 97(v)-(vii), on which basis both agreed
    that any re-making should be undertaken in the Upper Tribunal.

Assessment

31. I shall deal with the grounds in the following order:  ground  2,  then
    ground 3 and finally ground 1.

32. Ground 2 is that the judge took into account the conduct of  the  first
    and  second  appellants  in  assessing  the  third   appellant's   best
    interests, at paras 84 and 86.

33. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the judge was considering
    the third appellant's best interests at paras 84 and  86  and,  if  she
    did, whether she took into  account  the  conduct  of  the  parents  in
    assessing her best interests. Mr Malik accepted that, if the judge  was
    considering reasonableness at paras 84-86, she  was  entitled  to  take
    account of the parents' conduct.

34. Mr Malik submitted that  the  judge's  assessment  of  whether  it  was
    reasonable for the third appellant to leave the United Kingdom as  well
    as her assessment of the child's best interests was limited to paras 84-
    86 and that she  did  not  consider  these  issues  anywhere  else.  In
    relation to the reasonableness issue, this was because  (in  Mr  Mali's
    submission), the fact that the judge said, in the  second  sentence  of
    para 87, that: "In conclusion, taking account of factors a-d  above,  I
    find that it would be reasonable to expect the third appellant to leave
    the UK and to return to India".

35. Since Mr Malik accepts that the judge was entitled to take  account  of
    the parents' conduct in assessing reasonableness, the  submission  that
    the judge only  considered  reasonableness  at  paras  84-86  does  not
    advance the appellants' case in this appeal even if (which is  not  the
    case, for reasons explained at paras 40(iii) and 41  below)  the  judge
    took into account the conduct of the parents in the sentence beginning:
    "If the appellants were so concerned ..." in para 84.

36. Nevertheless, I should say that the fact that the judge  said:  "taking
    account of factors a-d" at para 87 does not mean that  she  was  saying
    that she had taken  into  account  only  those  factors  and  no  other
    factors. That would make no sense at all,  especially  given  the  care
    that the judge took to remind herself of the principle in MA (Pakistan)
    at paras 78 and 79 and again at para 81, of the importance of residence
    of seven years or more.

37. Likewise, in relation to  the  third  appellant's  best  interests,  it
    simply cannot be said that paras 84-86  were  the  only  paragraphs  in
    which the judge considered the best interests of the  third  appellant.
    She reminded herself of the relevant principles at para 74-76  and  80.
    Furthermore, even before setting out the relevant principles  at  paras
    74-76 and 80, it is clear that her assessment of the third  appellant's
    performance at school, at paras 65-69 and whether there were reasons on
    grounds of health for the third appellant to be allowed  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom, was part of the assessment of the third appellant's
    best interests.

38. It is not the case,  as  Mr  Malik  was  essentially  saying,  that  in
    referring to the relevant principles and  authorities,  the  judge  was
    merely going through the motions of setting out relevant principles and
    authorities and not applying them. Whilst it is  not  necessary  for  a
    judge to refer to relevant  authorities  provided  the  principles  are
    applied, I am satisfied that, in setting out the relevant principles in
    her decision, including the principle in MA (Pakistan)  concerning  the
    significance of residence  of  seven  years  or  more,  the  judge  was
    demonstrating that she was applying these principles when assessing the
    best interests of the appellant and  the  question  of  reasonableness.
    There is simply no reason to think otherwise.

39. I therefore do not accept that there is any  substance  in  Mr  Malik's
    submission that the only paragraphs in which the judge considered  both
    the reasonableness issue and the third appellant's best interests  were
    paras 84-86.

40. In summary, when the  judge's  decision  is  read  as  a  whole,  I  am
    satisfied that:

    (i)    The judge's assessment of whether it is reasonable for the third
         appellant to leave the United Kingdom was not limited to paras  84-
         86. Her assessment of the third appellant's  linguistic  abilities,
         and in particular, in  the  language  of  Hindi,  as  well  as  her
         assessment of the third appellant's school reports,  was  part  and
         parcel of her assessment of reasonableness. Paras 78,  79  and  81,
         where she reminded herself of MA (Pakistan) and the  importance  of
         residence of seven years or more, was also part of  her  assessment
         of reasonableness.

    (ii)   The judge's  assessment  of  the  third  appellant's  linguistic
         abilities as well as her assessment of the third appellant's school
         reports, was also part and parcel of her assessment  of  the  third
         appellant's best interests.  Having  made  those  assessments,  she
         reminded herself of the duty under s.55  and  relevant  authorities
         (JO, ZH (Tanzania) and EV  (Philippines)  at  paras  74-76  and  AM
         (Pakistan) and Kaur at para 80), before stating her conclusion,  in
         the first sentence of para 84, that it was in the best interests of
         the third appellant to remain with her parents.

    (iii)  I analyse para 84 as follows: In the first sentence of para  84,
         the judge stated her conclusion, that the  best  interests  of  the
         third appellant were to remain  with  her  parents.  The  following
         sentences were also part of her assessment of the best interests of
         the third appellant because it is clear  that  this  is  where  she
         considered the credibility of the evidence of the first and  second
         appellants on this issue, that it was in the best interests of  the
         third appellant to remain in the United Kingdom

             "I accept that the Appellants consider that it is in her  best
             interests to remain in the UK for the  sake  of  the  superior
             educational and career opportunities offered (which could lead
             to a career in medicine in the UK). I do not accept this;  the
             IDI makes it clear (as does EV (Philippines)) that the  better
             quality of education available in the UK cannot be relied upon
             except in exceptional circumstances. I also  acknowledge  that
             Mr. Grigg refers  to  the  need  for  continuity  rather  than
             upheaval at a sensitive stage  of  her  education,  the  Third
             Appellant being in the first year of GCSEs. If the  Appellants
             were so concerned about disruption to  the  Third  Appellant's
             education at a critical stage, it was open to them,  once  the
             First Appellant realised that she was not going to study again
             (in early 2015), to apply then for LTR on  the  basis  of  the
             Third Appellant's private life in the  hope  of  a  resolution
             before much of the GSCE first year course had been covered.

         The remainder of para 84, where the judge noted that the first  and
         second appellants had not  produced  any  evidence  of  the  public
         education  system  in  India,  was  part  of  her   assessment   of
         reasonableness. It was also relevant to her conclusion that it  was
         in the best interests of the third appellant  to  remain  with  her
         parents,  given  the  obvious  link  between  what  the  judge  was
         considering in  the  remainder  of  the  paragraph  and  the  issue
         immediately prior, i.e. the credibility  of  the  evidence  of  the
         first  and  second  appellants  about  their  concerns  about   the
         disruption to the third appellant's education. The reason why  both
         issues (reasonableness and best interests) fell  to  be  considered
         was that factor b., which is part of para 11.2.4 of the IDIs  which
         deals  with  reasonableness,  specifically   mentioned   the   best
         interests of a child.

41. I therefore do not accept that the judge took into account the  conduct
    of the parents in assessing the best interests of the  third  appellant
    in the sentence beginning: "If the Appellants were so concerned..."  in
    para 84. All the judge was doing in this part of para 84 is to  explain
    why she did not accept the evidence of the first and second  appellants
    that it was in the best interests of the third appellant to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom and to deal  with  the  submission  of  their  legal
    representative concerning the need for continuity rather than  upheaval
    at a sensitive stage in the third appellant's education.   My  view  is
    reinforced by the fact that the judge then went  on  to  note,  in  the
    remainder of that paragraph, that  there  was  no  evidence  about  the
    public examination system in India. The impact of any  such  disruption
    was plainly relevant to a consideration of both the best interests of a
    child as well as the question of reasonableness.

42. I have therefore concluded that there is no error of law at para 84.

43. I turn to para 86, the sentence that reads: "If the Third Appellant has
    not been exposed to Indian culture and cultural norms, which I doubt, I
    find that this would have been part  of  a  deliberate  policy  by  the
    parents to diminish her cultural ties  and  improve  their  immigration
    case".

44. Mr Malik submitted that this sentence in para 86 shows, again, that the
    judge had taken the conduct of the parents into account when  assessing
    the third appellant's best interests.

45. In my judgement, the whole of para 86 concerned the judge's  assessment
    of reasonableness.  Whereas  at  para  84  she  did  mention  the  best
    interests of the third appellant (because factor b of  para  11.2.4  of
    the IDIs did so), the judge made no reference at all at para 86 to  the
    third appellant's best interests, nor does factor d. in para 11.2.4  of
    the IDIs.

46. Given my conclusion that para 86 concerned the  judge's  assessment  of
    reasonableness and that Mr Malik accepted that the judge  was  entitled
    to  take  into  account  the  conduct  of  the  parents  in   assessing
    reasonableness, there is no error of law at para 86.

47. However, even if I am wrong about this, it is clear from the words  "If
    ... which I doubt ..." in the sentence in question that the  judge  did
    not accept that the third appellant had  not  been  exposed  to  Indian
    culture and cultural norms.   Accordingly,  in  the  remainder  of  the
    sentence,  beginning:  "I  find  ..."  the  judge   was   answering   a
    hypothetical issue that was not relevant to her decision on the appeal.



48. Accordingly, I have concluded that ground 2 is not established.

49. Before dealing with ground  3,  I  should  say,  although  it  was  not
    suggested in the grounds or by Mr Malik that the judge erred in finding
    that it was in the best interests of the third appellant to remain with
    her parents, this finding was the only one properly open to her on  any
    legitimate view, given her  rejection  of  the  claim  that  the  third
    appellant does not speak Hindi,  her  unchallenged  findings  that  the
    third appellant has good linguistic ability, that the  third  appellant
    has demonstrated that she learns a  language  well  through  immersion,
    that the third appellant has an ability to communicate competently with
    sympathetic interlocutors or to achieve this within a  reasonable  time
    frame, that the better quality  of  education  in  the  United  Kingdom
    cannot be relied upon except in  exceptional  circumstances,  and  that
    that there was no evidence about the public examination system in India
    to show that the third appellant would be significantly disadvantaged.

50. I turn to ground 3.

51. Mr Malik submitted that the judge erred in saying, at  para  91,  that:
    "there was no evidence of extraordinary talents or unusual achievements
    or involvements inside or outside school" because, in  his  submission,
    this was inconsistent with the principle in  MA  (Pakistan)  concerning
    the significance of residence of seven years or more.

52. It is plain that, at para 91, the judge was considering the strength of
    the private lives that each of the appellants had  established  in  the
    United  Kingdom.   Her  assessment  of  the  strength  of   the   third
    appellant's private life began from the second sentence of para 91  and
    ended immediately before the finding that "the third appellant  has  an
    unremarkable private life".

53. Whilst I accept that the principle in MA (Pakistan),  that  significant
    weight should be given to residence of seven years or more, is  founded
    on the fact that children will have established stronger roots  in  the
    community the longer they have been in  the  United  Kingdom  and  that
    residence of seven years  is  accepted  as  a  significant  point,  the
    precise amount of weight to be accorded to a child's private life as  a
    consequence of having lived in the United Kingdom for  seven  years  or
    more is not a fixity, although it  is  clear  that  significant  weight
    should nevertheless be attached to it such that there must be  powerful
    reasons for not granting leave.

54. In the instant case, the judge had been very careful to remind  herself
    that significant weight should be given to the fact that the  appellant
    had lived in the United Kingdom for more than seven  years,  more  than
    once. It was plainly relevant, nonetheless, for her to consider whether
    she was dealing with a child who,  in  the  judge's  words,  had  shown
    "extraordinary talents or unusual achievements or  involvements  inside
    or outside school". Not only was this relevant  to  deciding  precisely
    what weight should be given to  the  third  appellant's  private  life,
    albeit that it must be  significant,  but  also  the  strength  of  the
    factors on the state's side of the balancing exercise  in  relation  to
    proportionality in deciding whether there were powerful reasons for not
    granting leave.

55. I therefore do not accept that the judge erred in law at para 91.

56. I do not accept that there is any substance in the  general  submission
    that the judge failed to recognise the significance of  the  fact  that
    the third appellant had lived in the  United Kingdom for  seven  years.
    The fact is that the judge reminded herself of this principle more than
    once.  The judge was required to  identify  powerful  reasons  for  the
    third appellant not being granted  leave.  She  did  identify  powerful
    reasons. It is clear from her reasoning that she found  not  only  that
    the first and second appellants have a  poor  immigration  history  but
    that  their  actions  in  deliberating  setting  out  to  organise  the
    circumstances of the third appellant such as to be able to exploit  the
    seven-year rule for her and for themselves was a  deliberate  abuse  of
    the system of immigration control. Plainly, she considered  it  telling
    that, within weeks of the appellants arriving in the United Kingdom  in
    August 2009, the second appellant wound up his car  business  in  India
    which, on the judge's findings, had been established for at least eight
    years. In my judgment, the judge identified this as a powerful  reason.
    At para 98, the judge made it clear that  she  found  that  the  public
    interest in the appellants' removal  went  beyond  the  general  public
    interest in effective immigration control.

57. It is not the case that the third appellant was being punished for  the
    actions of her parents but simply that the balancing exercise was being
    undertaken so as to give appropriate weight to the  state's  interests.
    As the Court of Appeal made clear at para 44 of MA  (Pakistan),  it  is
    not the case that a child who has lived in the United Kingdom for seven
    years  or  more  should  be   refused   leave   only   in   exceptional
    circumstances, in contrast to the position when the old  DP5/96  policy
    was in force.

58. I turn to ground 1.

59. Ground 1 is a complaint about form over  substance,  in  my  judgement.
    Whilst I accept that the  Upper  Tribunal  said  at  para  (4)  of  the
    judicial head-note in Kaur, that the best interests  assessment  should
    "normally be carried out at the beginning of the  balancing  exercise",
    it does not follow that failure to do so will, ipso facto, amount to an
    error of law, much less a material error of law. There is no  authority
    for such a proposition. There are  authorities  to  the  contrary.  For
    example, at para 10 of Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74, the Supreme Court
    set out certain legal principles that Counsel for Mr Zoumbas said  were
    derived  from  three  decisions  of  the  Supreme  Court   (namely   ZH
    (Tanzania), H v Lord Advocate 2012 SC (UKSC) 308 and  H  (H)  v  Deputy
    Prosecutor of the Italian Republic [2013] 1 AC 338).  The Supreme Court
    said that those principles were not  in  doubt.  The  fourth  principle
    reads:

         "(4)     While different judges might approach the question of  the
             best interests of a child in different ways, it  is  important
             to ask oneself the right questions in  an  orderly  manner  in
             order to avoid the risk that the best  interests  of  a  child
             might be undervalued when other important considerations  were
             in play;"

60. This specifically states that judges may approach the assessment of the
    best interests of a child in different ways but that it  was  important
    to ask the right questions in an orderly manner. It does not say that a
    failure to consider the best interests of a child at the  beginning  of
    the balancing exercise will be an error of law.

61. In the instant case, it is clear that the judge asked herself  relevant
    questions in the assessment of the third appellant's best interests  in
    an  orderly  way.  She  considered  the  third   appellant's   language
    capability  (paras  53-56).  She  considered  the   third   appellant's
    performance at school (paras 65-71) which  was  also  relevant  to  the
    child's language capability. She considered her health (para  72).  She
    reminded  herself  of  the  principles  from  relevant  authorities  in
    relation to the best  interests  of  children  (paras  74-76)  and  the
    significance of residence  of  seven  years  (paras  77-81).  She  then
    applied para 11.2.4  of  the  IDIs  (paras  82-86)  and  as  factor  b.
    mentioned the best interests of children in the context  of  whether  a
    child should leave the United Kingdom, considered this  issue  both  in
    the context of best interests and reasonableness. She  then  turned  to
    consider the staged approach in assessing Article 8 claims outside  the
    Rules, at paras 87 onwards.

62. Ground 1 is therefore not established.

59.   Overall, I agree with Ms Brocklesby-Weller that the  judge's  decision
    is a very detailed assessment of  the  Article  8  claims  of  all  the
    appellants, as well as the youngest  child.  She  considered  the  best
    interests o the third appellant is a  child-centred  way.  She  plainly
    gave significant weight to the fact that the third appellant had  lived
    in the United Kingdom for at least seven years. She identified powerful
    reasons for the third appellant not being granted leave.

63. Finally, I should say that I have noted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge who granted permission  did  so  in  trenchant  terms.  Mr  Malik
    (rightly) did not rely upon the terms  in  which  permission  had  been
    granted as support for his submissions that Judge Coll  had  materially
    erred in law. However, given the terms in which permission was granted,
    it is appropriate for me to make some observations,  less  it  be  said
    that the conclusion I have reached in these appeals is wrong because it
    is  inconsistent  with  the  firmly  views  of  the  permission   judge
    notwithstanding that  he  used  the  words  "arguable"  and  "arguably"
    several times.

64. Although the permission judge referred to it being arguable that  Judge
    Coll had made insufficient findings, he did not explain how or in  what
    way the findings of Judge Coll were arguably inadequate. Nor  was  this
    apparent from the grounds since  this  point  was  not  raised  in  the
    grounds. This leaves, then, his view that Judge  Coll  arguably  placed
    too much weight on certain matters and too little on certain others.

65. On a proper examination of the reasons the permission  judge  gave  for
    granting permission, it is clear that he was concerned about the weight
    that Judge Coll gave to various factors. He said, for example,  that it
    is arguable that she gave "insufficient weight" to the  extent  of  the
    third appellant's integration in the United Kingdom; she arguably  gave
    "undue emphasis to the factors bearing upon the situation on return  in
    contradistinction to the extent of deracination given  the  application
    of the [seven-year] benchmark policy period"; that it was arguable that
    "the weight attached to the element of  immigration  history  has  been
    excessive";  that  it  was  "arguable  that  the  Judge  has   attached
    insufficient weight to the question  of  deracination";  and  "arguable
    [that the Judge attributes] excessive weight ... to the timing analysis
    in relation to the actions of the parents in contradistinction  to  the
    question of the extent of the integration of [the third appellant]".

66. The weight to be given to the various factors is essentially  a  matter
    for the first-instance judge and will rarely give rise to an  error  of
    law. The grounds did not contend that the weight Judge Coll  placed  on
    individual factors was unreasonable. Nor did Mr Malik, although he  did
    suggest at one point that the judge had given excessive weight  to  the
    state's  interest  in   the   balancing   exercise   in   relation   to
    proportionality at para 97(iv). At the same time, he acknowledged  that
    weight was a matter for the judge.

67. In my judgment, notwithstanding the trenchant terms in which permission
    was granted, the reality is that the permission judge simply  disagreed
    with the decision of Judge Coll. Whilst another judge may have  made  a
    different decision, it simply cannot be said that the decision of Judge
    Coll was unreasonable. Mr Malik did not suggest that it was.

    Decision

    The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Coll did  not  involve
    the making of any error of law.  Her decision stands.  The  appellants'
    appeals to the Upper Tribunal are dismissed.
