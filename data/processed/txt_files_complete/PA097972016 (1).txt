Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Haddow, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran, brought up as a Sunni  Muslim.   He
    sought asylum  in  the  UK,  based  upon  his  conversion  in  Iran  to
    Christianity. He said that while he was away from home, with relatives,
    the authorities raided a hut at the family orchard which  he  had  been
    using for Christian gatherings, while such a meeting was  in  progress.
    The authorities later went to his house and took his computer and other
    belongings.  His family prompted him to flee to the UK.

 2. The appellant's account is set out in the respondent's letter  refusing
    his claim, dated 26 August 2016, in fuller terms, the accuracy of which
    he does not dispute.

 3. The respondent rejected the appellant's account  of  events  "in  their
    entirety" (�42).

 4. The appellant provided the respondent with a statement  dated  17  June
    2016 (item D, respondent's bundle) in which he says that he attends the
    T Church.  At his interview on 16 August 2017 he was asked  about  that
    matter (Q/A 129 - 138), but the refusal letter says nothing  about  his
    practice of Christianity in the UK.

 5. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the FtT say that he "believes that
    he qualifies as a refugee on the grounds  of  his  religion",  but  are
    otherwise generic.

 6. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hands dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons explained in her decision promulgated on 24 April 2017.

 7. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the UT, 1-5, (amplified from those
    upon which the FtT refused permission) are stated  in  the  application
    for permission to the UT dated 4 October 2017.

 8. On 19 October 2017 UT Judge Coker granted  permission,  considering  it
    arguable that the judge "misunderstood elements of the evidence  relied
    upon, and failed to consider the possibility of perception in  reaching
    [her] conclusions".

 9. Mr Haddow abandoned ground 5, correctly pointing out that it was  based
    on the FtT accepting that the appellant's family had  been  subject  to
    two visits by the authorities, when she had not done so.  He sought  to
    argue 3 supplementary grounds, set out in his written submissions.

10. Mr McVeety, very reasonably,  did  not  oppose  the  expansion  of  the
    grounds, and further acknowledged that the case should be approached on
    the basis that the appellant needed only to have shown  that  he  is  a
    genuine convert, not that he might evangelise.

11. This decision should be read along with the FtT's  decision,  and  with
    grounds 1-4 ("G1-4") and the supplementary grounds ("SG1-3").

12. G1 says, and Mr McVeety accepted, that the FtT went wrong by taking  it
    against the appellant that the Facebook record shows postings in  1995,
    which he could not have made.  That date appears as a record of  events
    in the year of the  appellant's  birth,  not  as  a  date  of  posting.
    Facebook did not exist in 1995.

13. G1 further notes that it was not clear that  the  appellant's  Facebook
    page required a password.  The challenge is  on  the  basis  that  this
    "would be penetrated by the Iranians" and the  judge  should  not  have
    left the matter unresolved.  AB and others [2015] 0257 is cited.

14. G2 is directed against the judge's comment, "He could truthfully say he
    was a failed asylum seeker, which would not lead to a  risk  of  harm".
    It is said that on return the appellant's Facebook  password  might  be
    requested, refusal would carry a negative inference, his page might  be
    scrutinised, and risk might arise even from activities  carried  on  in
    bad faith.  Danian [1999] INLR 533 is cited in support.

15. G1 and G2 are closely linked, and may be resolved together.

16. Mr Haddow submitted that it should be assumed the  appellant  would  be
    returned on documents which would lead to his being questioned, and  in
    turn to the Facebook posts being discovered.  He said  the  possibility
    of return on his own documents was no answer, and nor was  the  judge's
    comment about how he might reply to questioning.

17. Mr McVeety said that BA and others concerned public internet "blogging"
    sites, not Facebook, which was a private matter under  the  appellant's
    control.  He could determine which posts appeared on his account at any
    time.  His evidence had been only a screenshot of what appeared at  one
    moment.  If he was not a genuine Christian,  he  was  not  entitled  to
    protection on the basis of a removable  Facebook  record  and  of  "not
    being required to lie".

18. I find that the judge went wrong in her reasoning  about  the  apparent
    date of posts on Facebook, but nothing turns on that.  Facebook is  not
    a public site in the sense of a "blog".   The  judge  was  entitled  to
    find, based on the case put to her, and for the reasons she gave,  that
    if the appellant is not a Christian, no risk arises from  his  Facebook
    account.

19. If the matter did require to be revisited, it would be resolved against
    the appellant, for the reasons advanced by Mr McVeety.   The  appellant
    failed to make any case that (if not a Christian) he might find himself
    under questioning by the authorities, and that he  is  entitled  to  an
    assumption of an honest reply in terms likely to lead to  discovery  of
    materials placing him at  risk  of  persecution.   There  are  numerous
    unlikely links in that line of argument.

20. G1 and G2 disclose no error which might contribute to the  decision  of
    the FtT being set aside.

21. G3 is directed  against  the  FtT's  conclusion  at  �81  that  it  was
    deceitful of the appellant not to tell one church that he was  pursuing
    a Christian course at another, as none of the witnesses were  asked  to
    opine whether this was deceitful or  unusual,  and  no  rational  judge
    "could conclude this constituted a lie".  Mr Haddow advanced this, more
    moderately, as a lack of a cogent basis for a finding of deceit.

22. The decision records at �41 that a witness from the T Church, where the
    appellant had been recognised for baptism, was asked  whether  he  knew
    the appellant was being baptised at E B Church.  He replied that he did
    not, and did not find this surprising.

23. Mr McVeety submitted that the judge was entitled to note  at  �81  that
    the appellant was asking the T church for  baptism  while  not  telling
    them that he was taking an intensive baptism course at another  church,
    and so appeared  to  have  been  "hedging  his  bets",  and  that  this
    rationally went to show that  he  was  not  genuine  in  his  Christian
    beliefs.  In reply, Mr Haddow said that the evidence at �40  -  41  did
    not warrant the conclusion that the appellant was  playing  one  church
    off against another, and there was no reason not to accept his  baptism
    in his "home church".

24. I accept that there was nothing sinister  in  the  appellant  attending
    both a church convenient to his place of residence and a central church
    with a strong Iranian participation.  However, that was not  the  basis
    of the judge's adverse finding, which the ground somewhat  exaggerates.
    The matter was put to the witness most likely  to  have  had  something
    useful to say.  The evidence plainly was that  the  appellant  did  not
    choose to share information with both churches.  The interpretation  of
    bet-hedging was well within the range of judgments reasonably open.

25. I find that G3 discloses no error.

26. G4 says that the conclusion that taking another Iranian to church  does
    not constitute evangelism draws too fine a distinction, but in view  of
    the concession above by Mr McVeety, that does not need to  be  decided.



27. SG1 concerns whether the appellant's "mother tongue" is Kurdish Sorani,
    not Farsi, and whether the  judge  at  �76-77  went  wrong  in  finding
    anything adverse in the appellant's use of a language medium which  was
    less than ideal for baptismal instruction.

28. Mt Haddow said that the judge's analysis was impenetrable, and  pointed
    out that she took it for more than the "small insignificant  point"  it
    first seemed.  Mr McVeety said that the  passage  was  rather  hard  to
    follow, but it was open to the judge to take the view she did.

29. I find the  judge's  point  obscure.   The  question  of  its  relative
    importance, in context, is postponed to the end of this decision.

30. SG2 is that the judge failed  to  treat  the  evidence  in  the  round,
    reaching conclusions only after rejecting the  appellant's  account  of
    events in Iran.  It was argued that this sequential approach  left  out
    of account that the appellant, if a Christian, must have become one  at
    some point; that unlike events in Iran, there was naturally independent
    evidence of events in the UK; the judge made a "cart before  horse"  or
    structural error, exemplified by Mibanga [2005] EWCA Civ 367;  and  the
    judge failed to reserve  final  judgment,  and  to  allow  evidence  on
    whether the appellant was a Christian in the UK to impact also  on  the
    question whether he was a Christian in Iran.

31. Mr McVeety responded that the appellant made no direct challenge to any
    of the adverse findings on his alleged conversion in Iran; the case was
    not one of an entirely new protection ground after failure on  another,
    but a claimed continuity of interest in  Christianity;  judges  had  to
    decide cases in some order, and could do so point by point, so long  as
    they took the correct overall approach; and  there  was  no  artificial
    separation of items of evidence, as in  Mibanga,  which  was  concerned
    with expert evidence, such as medical reports.

32. It is inevitable that particular conclusions  are  expressed  point  by
    point.  The UK conversion and baptism claim followed straight  on  from
    the Iranian claim.  The       judge would have been wrong to  say  that
    failure on one inevitably meant failure on the other, but equally wrong
    to say that findings  on  one  could  not  influence  the  other.   She
    directed herself correctly on the need to look at evidence in the round
    at �14 and again at �57, and framed her final conclusion accordingly at
    �83.  There is nothing to suggest that her overall conclusion was based
    on anything but the correct legal approach.

33. SG2 shows no error.

34. SG3 is error of approach to a conversion  case.   The  essence  of  the
    argument is that (i) this is not simple fact-finding of past events but
    an inference from primary facts; (ii) opinion  evidence  is  admissible
    and apt to be treated as expert evidence; in SA (Iran) [2012] EWHC 2575
    the High Court pointed  to  the  value  of  corroboration  from  church
    sources, and of evidence of participation as the only sound measure  of
    genuineness of conversion;  and  (iii)  assessment  of  an  appellant's
    credibility is of limited value, and insufficient  where  the  finding,
    properly  considered,  relies  primarily  on  the  undue  credulity  of
    independent witnesses - AR v SSHD [2017] CSIH 52 at �32, 35, 36.

35. I do not find error on this ground either.

36. SA is not the report of an appeal, but a judicial review  by  a  Deputy
    Judge of the High Court of a decision by the respondent that a case was
    clearly unfounded.  It was not cited to the FtT.  It is not binding  on
    the FtT or on the UT.  The passage relied upon  is  obiter,  a  passing
    statement (although a very strong one) of the difficulty  of  examining
    the genuineness of a religious conversion.  It has not been repeated in
    further case law, and there are many cases  passing  through  tribunals
    and courts based on religious conversion.  It establishes no  principle
    of general application.

37. AR v SSHD does not yield any general doctrine which tends to show error
    of law by Judge Hands.   She  did  not  ignore  any  evidence  directly
    supporting the appellant.  She was aware of the nature of her decision:
    the difficult question of whether the  appellant's  outward  conversion
    was reasonably likely to be inwardly genuine.  She accepted the  church
    witnesses as truthful, and reached her conclusion on all the  evidence,
    not finding them unduly credulous, either expressly or by implication.

38. The meticulous scrutiny of the decision by Mr Haddow has in my  opinion
    disclosed only a factual error about  the  date  of  Facebook  postings
    (G1), which is of no significance, and another about  the  language  of
    instruction for baptism (SG1), of minor significance.  It  is  no  more
    than the type of quibble which  might  be  unearthed  in  any  decision
    involving multiple points of detail.

39. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

40. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  The matter was not  addressed  in
    the UT.  Anonymity has been preserved herein.
