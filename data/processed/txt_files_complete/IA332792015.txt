Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Z Ahmad (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr J Metzer (instructed through the assistance of
                    the Bar Pro Bono Unit, a body licensed by the Bar
                    Council)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Secretary  of  State  in
    relation to a decision of the First-tier Tribunal   (Judge  Mozalowski)
    promulgated on 16  November  2016  by  which  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    allowed the Appellant's appeal on human rights (article 8) grounds.

 2. For the sake of continuity and clarity I will refer  in  this  Decision
    and Reasons to Ms Gandhiraj as the Appellant and the Secretary of State
    as the Respondent

 3. The matter first came before me in the Upper Tribunal on 30  June  2017
    for a an initial hearing when I found that the First-tier Tribunal  had
    made a material error of law  and  I  set  aside  the  decision  whilst
    preserving the First-tier Tribunal's finding in the Appellant's  favour
    regarding her dishonesty.

 4. As the Appellant's  representative  was  not  in  a  position  to  call
    evidence on that day I was unable to proceed with the rehearing and  so
    the matter was adjourned to enable him to  adduce  additional  evidence
    which I gave him permission to do.

 5. On 30th June I found as follows:-

      a)  The  case  before   the   First-tier   Tribunal   was   relatively
         straightforward.  The Appellant is an Indian national who had  come
         to the UK in 2011 on a Tier 4 Student visa and then in May 2012 was
         granted a Tier 1 Post-Study Work  visa  valid  until  August  2014.
         Shortly before the expiry of that leave she made an application for
         leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and that  application
         was eventually refused on 19th August 2015. It  was  that  Decision
         which  was  under  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
         circumstances of the refusal were that the Appellant had produced a
         Certificate of Sponsorship said to be from the  National  Institute
         of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) but when it was checked it was
         found that NICE had not  issued  it.   It  was  therefore  a  false
         document.  The Secretary of State refused  the  appeal  relying  on
         paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules  which  is  a  mandatory
         ground of refusal where false documents  have  been  produced.   It
         matters not whether the Appellant is aware or culpable simply  that
         deception occurred or a false document was  produced.   It  is  now
         trite law, particularly with regard to the  case  of  AA  (Nigeria)
         [2010] EWCA Civ 773 that there has to be dishonesty but it does not
         necessarily need to be that of the  Appellant.   The  Secretary  of
         State therefore had no discretion and indeed it is accepted by  the
         Appellant that the document is false.

      b) The Appellant's argument, which was considered  in  detail  by  the
         First-tier Tribunal, was that that document had  been  supplied  to
         her by an advisor that she had consulted.   She  had  no  knowledge
         that the document was not genuine when it was submitted and it  was
         only later in the day, in fact October 2014,  that  she  discovered
         the deception.  She spoke to the woman concerned who advised her to
         withdraw her application because it was  not  a  genuine  document.
         She did not do that.  She consulted a  solicitor.   She  eventually
         did notify the Home Office that the document was false  in  January
         2015 and unsurprisingly the application was thereafter refused.

      c) The Appellant was unrepresented before the First-tier Tribunal  and
         what has been argued on her behalf in  front  of  me  was  that  by
         telling the Home  Office  that  the  document  was  false  she  had
         effectively withdrawn the application.  By informing the  Secretary
         of State that the document  was  false  she  was  saying  that  her
         application could not succeed.  It was argued that the  application
         should have been regarded as and  dealt  with  as  a  human  rights
         application on Article 8 grounds. It was argued before  me  on  her
         behalf that the appeal was similarly upon Article 8 grounds only.

      d)  It was nevertheless important for the Judge to deal with the issue
         of the production of  the  false  document  and  her  behaviour  in
         relation to it because of the impact it would have  on  any  future
         applications. The Secretary of State had informed the Appellant  in
         the Letter of Refusal that any future applications would be refused
         on the basis of 320(7B).   It was also relevant  to  any  balancing
         exercise under Article 8. In considering this  the  Judge  accepted
         that the Appellant was naï¿½ve rather than dishonest and that  whilst
         she did delay before notifying the Home Office the fact is she  did
         inform the Home Office and some  months  before  the  Decision  was
         made.  The Judge found that there was no dishonesty  on  her  part.
         That is an important  finding  for  the  Appellant  in  any  future
         applications.  It does not mean however that the Secretary of State
         was not entitled to dismiss or refuse the application on the  basis
         of paragraph 322(1) indeed, as indicated above, she had no choice.

      e)  There was some discussion with Mr Metzer about  whether  I  should
         consider whether the Judge had made an error of law in going on  to
         find that, absent the Appellant's dishonesty s.322 should not  have
         been applied because it was not referred to in the grounds. I  find
         that I should consider it because it is an  obvious  point  and  an
         obvious error in that the Judge misapplied the law.  However, given
         Mr Metzer's argument that in reality this was an Article  8  appeal
         only, it is immaterial.  The Judge found that she could not succeed
         under the Rules and that is plainly right because she did not  have
         an offer of employment; there was no job with  NICE  and  therefore
         she could not possibly have succeeded.

      f) The Judge then went on to  consider  Article  8.   He  set  out  at
         paragraph 29 the law and he set out correctly that Article 8 is not
         a general dispensing power and there have to be compelling  reasons
         to look at Article 8 outside the Rules.   He  referred  himself  to
         Huang [2007] UKHL 11 and Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and  then  proceeded
         to consider the matter.  He did not explain what it was  about  the
         case that led him to consider Article 8 outside the Rules  and  the
         first  time  any  compelling  circumstances  are  mentioned  is  at
         paragraph 35 where he found compelling circumstances to  allow  the
         appeal. However, I agree with Mr Metzer's submission that if  there
         are compelling circumstances to justify allowing the appeal,  there
         must be compelling circumstances to consider Article 8.

      g) However, I do find the Judge's approach to Article 8 to  be  flawed
         and indeed bordering on the perverse.  The Judge paid  lip  service
         to Section 117B of the Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.   Section
         117 is an important factor that the Tribunal is  required  to  take
         into account.  It makes clear, and it is  accepted  by  Mr  Metzer,
         that the public interest in the maintenance of immigration  control
         is in his words a crucial factor and it can only be  outweighed  by
         something compelling.  The only compelling circumstances  that  the
         Judge referred to which Mr Metzer relied upon are

             (1)  She has a rich and extensive private life in the UK and

             (2)  A person should be encouraged to deal honestly  with  the
                  Home  Office  and  that  assists  in  the  maintenance  of
                  immigration control.

         The latter point I find to be a point without merit.  Of  course  a
         person should deal honestly  with  the  Home  Office;  that  is  an
         expectation and they should not be rewarded for doing so.   Not  to
         deal honestly with the Home Office is a very  serious  matter,  but
         persons should not be praised for acting lawfully in the  same  way
         as a person should not be praised for not breaking the  law.   That
         leaves only her private life.

      h) The other factors in Section 117B to be considered are:-  that  she
         speaks English, which is a neutral matter.

      i) The next matter is whether  she  is  financially  independent.   Mr
         Metzer argued that she was and the Judge was right to find that she
         was on the basis that there was every possibility  that  she  would
         find employment.  It may be that at some point in  the  future  she
         would be financially independent if given leave to remain;  however
         the fact remains that at the  date  of  the  hearing  she  was  not
         financially  independent.   As  the  Judge  pointed  out  she   was
         dependent upon her friends.  It is quite clear  from  the  case  of
         Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803 that financial independence requires a
         person to be financially independent of others.  That is made clear
         in paragraphs 63  and  64  of  Rhuppiah.   I  therefore  reject  Mr
         Metzer's argument that the fact that she will find employment means
         she is financially independent.  The requirement  does  not  permit
         future expectation; it is a present requirement.

      j) Section 117B(4) relates to a person being here unlawfully which she
         has not been and therefore that does not count against her  and  is
         another neutral point.

      k) Section 117B(5) relates to private life and says that little weight
         should be attached to a private life built up while a person's stay
         is precarious.  It  has  been  established  that  any  leave  which
         requires renewal is precarious as this Appellant's leave  was.   Mr
         Metzer argued, quite rightly, that little weight does not  mean  no
         weight and he argued that the  amount  of  weight  to  be  attached
         varies with the quality and extent of the private life in  question
         and he argued that  as  her's  is  particularly  rich,  significant
         weight should be attached to  it.   She  has  built  up  a  lot  of
         friends, a large network, she does charity  work  for  the  temple;
         however there is nothing  particularly  unusual  in  that.   It  is
         inevitable that over several years spent in the  United  Kingdom  a
         person will build up contacts and relationships and I do  not  find
         anything unusual in that particular private life  and  whilst  some
         weight has to be attached to it that weight has to be little.

      l) There is nothing else in this case that could lead  to  the  appeal
         having been allowed.  All she can argue  is  her  private  life  to
         which little weight should be attached and the fact that she speaks
         English.  Against her is the  fact  that  she  is  not  financially
         independent, she does not meet the requirements of the Rules and  I
         accept the argument raised by the Secretary of  State,  relying  on
         the case of Gurung [2012] EWCA Civ 62, that the  Judge  appears  to
         have taken a liking to this Appellant and to have been looking  for
         ways to allow the appeal.  The reasons for allowing the appeal  are
         scant in the extreme and as I have said bordering on perverse.  The
         Judge has given wholly inadequate reasons for allowing  the  appeal
         and for that reason I set aside the Decision.

      m) I am prepared to preserve the finding  in  the  Appellant's  favour
         regarding her dishonesty.

      n) Having preserved a finding it  is  not  appropriate  to  remit  the
         matter to the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr Metzer was not in a position
         to proceed with a rehearing today as  he  sought  and  was  granted
         permission to adduce additional evidence.

 6. For the resumed hearing Mr  Metzer  had  produced  on  the  Appellant's
    behalf a bundle of evidence  and  a  bundle  of  authorities.  He  also
    helpfully provided a skeleton argument. The first section of the bundle
    of evidence was the evidence that was before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and the second section was new evidence.

 7. It is helpful to set out a chronology in this case

 8. The Appellant was born in India on 17 March 1973. She was  educated  to
    degree level in India obtaining a first class degree  in  physics  from
    the University of Kerala in 1993. She commenced a Master's  degree  but
    did not complete it due to getting married. She married in a love match
    against her parents' wishes and her daughter was born in 1995.

 9. In 1999 she started work in India and  worked  continuously  until  she
    left to come to the UK with a student visa in January 2011 leaving  her
    16-year-old daughter living with her parents.  By  this  time  she  was
    divorced  from  her  husband.  They  had  parted  in   1996.    Divorce
    proceedings were commenced in 2000 and  she  was  finally  divorced  in
    2008.

10. The Appellant's leave to enter the United Kingdom was on the basis that
    she was going to study for an MBA at the University of Northampton  and
    she graduated from that with distinction in March  2012.  Between  June
    2011 and June 2014 the Appellant worked for a number of  organisations,
    in particular as a customer  relationship  manager  at  the  Nationwide
    Building Society and Barclays Bank, as a multiagency  safeguarding  hub
    administrator for Northampton County  Council  and  as  a  lecturer  in
    mathematics at Northampton College.

11. In August 2012 she was granted leave to remain as a Tier 1  post  study
    migrant and in August 2014 she submitted  an  application  for  further
    leave to remain to work for NICE. That was the application  which  upon
    refusal was the subject of the appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and it was the  sponsorship  letter  supposedly  from  NICE  which  was
    fraudulent.

12. As I indicated in my earlier decision,  recited  above,  the  Appellant
    subsequently informed the Home Office  of  the  difficulties  with  the
    sponsorship letter with the inevitable result that the application  was
    refused under paragraph 322 of the Immigration Rules.

13. In addition to her studies and her employment the  Appellant  has  also
    volunteered for a number of organisations in a caring capacity and  has
    also assisted and cared for other people in the United  Kingdom.  There
    are considerable number of supporting documents, statements and letters
    praising her as a good, honest caring person who is  an  asset  to  the
    community.

14.  In terms of witness evidence I had statements from the Appellant dated
    11 October 2016 and 17 August 2017. I had witness  statements  from  Mr
    Richard Lazaro, Mrs Joyce Ball, Mr Joe Pratt, Mr Navid Kamal, Dr  Jacob
    Devadason, Mrs Sylvia Goodlad and Mr  Geoffrey  Adu-Amponsah.  All  the
    witnesses' statements were dated August 2017.  I  heard  oral  evidence
    from the Appellant, Mr Lazaro, Mrs Ball, Mr Kamal Dr Devadason and  Mrs
    Goodlad.

15. In her evidence the Appellant explained the provenance and relevance of
    two letters, one from Grangemore Properties  and  one  from  a  company
    called K Veg. The Appellant explained that  she  had  recently  started
    work for Grangemore Properties on a part-time basis, although she could
    become full-time. She currently works three days a week for a salary of
    ï¿½15,600 per annum. She has only recently taken up that  employment  and
    therefore there are no payslips available.

16. The  K  Veg  letter  offers  her  employment,  conditionally  upon  her
    resolving her immigration status, as marketing  manager  at  an  annual
    salary of ï¿½28,000. Neither of those companies  are  currently  approved
    sponsors.

17. The Appellant  produced  a  document  from  the  Home  Office  sent  to
    Grangemore Properties confirming she has permission to work. I pause at
    this point to note that this is rather surprising given that she has no
    leave to remain. Nevertheless the document  originates  from  the  Home
    Office.

18. The Appellant was unable to tell me which of the  two  employments  she
    would undertake if her appeal is successful. She did however  say  that
    her real aim/dream is to obtain a  PhD  which  she  will  fund  through
    employment. It is also her dream to make her family proud and for  them
    to forgive her for marrying against their wishes.

19. She said that her rent is ï¿½300-ï¿½350 per calendar month and that she has
    never relied on anybody else for financial support nor has she accessed
    state benefits.

20. In cross-examination the Appellant said that prior  to  coming  to  the
    United Kingdom in 2011 she lived alone with her daughter. She confirmed
    that her daughter lived with her parents after she came to the  UK  but
    said that she did not now know where her daughter is living.  She  said
    that she is applying to go to university abroad but was unable to  tell
    me where her daughter lives. With regard to contact with  her  daughter
    she said that she has tried to have contact but does not hear from  her
    and last spoke to her some four  months  ago.  She  did  not  establish
    during that conversation where her daughter was living. She was  unable
    to say when her daughter stopped living with her parents. She also said
    that she was not in contact with her parents and last spoke to them  in
    2013 when she went to visit them and they did not make her welcome. She
    then mentioned that her daughter's father still lives in the same place
    and he sees her.

21. In addition to last seeing her parents in 2013 she  was  asked  if  she
    spoke to them on the telephone and she said that she did not. She  last
    tried in March when she rang their home phone number but the  call  was
    not answered. She said that she tried again with the same result.

22. When asked if she had left friends behind in India  in  2011  when  she
    came to the UK she said that she did not. She said that she had had  to
    struggle to earn to support her daughter. She was estranged from all of
    her relatives and had no friends. She said  that  despite  spending  20
    years in India as an adult she had no friends because she had  to  work
    immediately and had no social contact. When  asked  whether  she  could
    work in India she said she could not because she has  never  worked  in
    the business field in India. She said numerous people in India have MBA
    qualifications and they are therefore worthless.

23. She was asked whether she could keep in contact with her friends in the
    UK from India but she said not because most of them are not  on  social
    media and it would not be easy.

24. She also said, when asked about her daughter, and her  daughter  living
    in India without her  that  she  had  laid  good  foundations  for  her
    daughter who was doing well in her education and that it was all  right
    for her daughter to live independently.  She  said  that  her  daughter
    could live independently but she herself could not.

25. With regard to her volunteer work in the UK she was asked  whether  she
    could do volunteer work in India but said there were no  volunteers  in
    India; there was no opportunity to do voluntary work.

26. In answer to questions from me as to who looked after her daughter when
    she went to work, she said that in 1999 when she started work she  only
    worked school hours and she told me that at  weekends  she  locked  her
    daughter in the house. After considerable probing she  then  said  that
    she left her daughter at day-care.

27. In re-examination by Mr Metzer the Appellant said she became  estranged
    from her parents in 1994 when she left them to get married. Her husband
    left after two years.

28. She said that when she came to the UK she wanted to equip herself  with
    something which will mean she will be respected in India and no  longer
    have to suffer the stigma of divorce. She wants to accomplish something
    to make her parents see that she is doing well and is happy.  She  said
    it would hurt her to leave the people she has come to become fond of in
    the UK.

29. She was asked again why she cannot find employment  in  India  and  she
    said that she is a woman; that age is a barrier and  that  anybody  can
    get an MBA and therefore they are not worth anything.  She said however
    that a PhD is valuable.

30. I asked the Appellant why, if it is the case that an MBA  is  worthless
    in India because everyone get them, she came to the UK to study for  an
    MBA. Her answer was that she wanted to study for a PhD but  a  Master's
    degree was a prerequisite.

31. I next heard evidence from Mr Lazaro who adopted his witness  statement
    to the effect that he has assumed  a  paternal  relationship  with  the
    Appellant and sees her as a daughter. He saw her, he said,  practically
    every day until recently when he moved to Gravesend.  He still sees her
    every week or so and talks regularly to her on the phone. He said  that
    he never helped her financially. He said he believed she has a daughter
    in India but was not sure whether she was in contact with her. He  said
    that she had a problem with her family who have cut her  off.  He  does
    not know whether she is in touch with her daughter.

32. I then heard from Mrs Ball who adopted her statement and was then cross-
    examined. She said that she had seen the Appellant a few times when she
    lived in Northamptonshire but that she has not  lived  there  for  four
    years. She said that she used to meet the Appellant in Northampton  for
    shopping trips but that now they communicate by email and talk  on  the
    telephone, possibly twice a week. In relation to the Appellant's family
    in India she said that she has a daughter with whom she is  in  contact
    occasionally. She said she thinks that the  daughter  is  studying  and
    therefore very busy and that the relationship  is  sometimes  okay  and
    sometimes strained as it often is with daughters.  She  said  that  she
    herself had spoken to the daughter via social media some years ago. She
    said that the Appellant's relationship with her parents  is  very  good
    and that she speaks very highly of them and told  Mrs  Ball  about  the
    family and what is happening. She wasn't aware that the  Appellant  had
    visited her parents in 2013.

33. In re-examination when she was asked what discussion she had  with  the
    Appellant about her family in India, Mrs Ball said that  the  Appellant
    told her about her sister who is going through a medical condition  and
    about her father who has been ill.

34. I then heard from Navid Kamal. He adopted his statement as his evidence
    in chief and was cross-examined. He knows the Appellant as  a  customer
    in the supermarket where he works and he sees her almost  every  second
    day when she shops. He has occasionally communicated with her  by  text
    as well but has never met her outside of his work environment.

35. I next heard from Dr David Devadason. He adopted his witness  statement
    and was cross-examined. He said that he meets the Appellant  more  than
    twice a week in church but does not see her otherwise than  at  church.
    In terms of the Appellant's personal life he was only able to say  that
    he knows that she is from India and  came  to  the  UK  to  study.  His
    relationship with her is purely on a faith basis.

36. I then heard from Mr Sylvia Goodlad. She adopted her statement  as  her
    evidence in chief and was cross-examined. She said that she used to see
    the Appellant quite a lot as they went to the same  gym  and  swimming.
    They met three years ago. Now she said the Appellant texts  her  mainly
    and invites her to church.  They  communicate  regularly  by  text  and
    telephone calls and the last time she had seen the  Appellant  was  the
    previous week. Mrs  Goodlad  was  asked  about  her  comment  that  the
    Appellant is a proud mother of a lovely daughter and she confirmed that
    to be the case. She said that the  Appellant  speaks  to  her  daughter
    regularly and to her parents on a weekly  basis.  With  regard  to  her
    parents she specifically confirmed she is in contact with them and that
    her relationship with them is very  affectionate  and  empathetic.  She
    said that the Appellant cares about her parents and does not like being
    away from them but has chosen to be in the UK. She said  the  Appellant
    had told her that she speaks to them very often because  she  likes  to
    keep in touch.

37. Mr Metzer relied on that oral evidence the documentary evidence and  to
    other statements from Mr Pratt and Mr Adu-Amponsah  who  did  not  give
    oral evidence.

Submissions

38. In her submissions Miss Ahmed challenged the  Appellant's  credibility.
    She submitted that she was evasive with regard to some of her  evidence
    and her evidence about her  relationship  with  and  contact  with  her
    daughter and parents conflicted with that of Mrs Ball and Mrs  Goodlad.
    The Appellant had painted a very different picture in  court  from  the
    one she had painted to her friends.

39. She referred me to the authority of SS (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387,
    paragraphs 31 to 33 which indicates that  the  starting  point  is  the
    Immigration Rules. She also referred me to Miah (section 117B NIAA 2002
    - children) [2016] UKUT 00131 (IAC) and the IDIs.

40. She noted that the Appellant spent the first 38 years of  her  life  in
    India; that she was educated there to graduate level and  was  employed
    there for over 10 years. She has her parents there and a  daughter  and
    she submitted she must have friends as well.

41. Miss Ahmed submitted that the Appellant's skills and qualifications  in
    the UK, including an MBA, would assist  her  to  obtain  employment  in
    India and she would be able to integrate well into India on return. She
    argued there were  no  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  Appellant
    integrating back into Indian society.

42. Miss Ahmed accepted there was some stigma attached  to  divorced  women
    but those did not amount to very  significant  obstacles,  particularly
    considering this particular  Appellant's  resourcefulness,  personality
    and history.

43. In terms of whether there  are  compelling  circumstances  to  consider
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules  she  submitted  that  all  the
    Appellant had was her relationship  with  her  friends  which  was  not
    compelling and the contact she has with them currently can  be  equally
    well exercised from India. She has managed to keep in contact with  her
    family  in  India,  including  with  her  daughter  and  if   that   is
    satisfactory it certainly would be satisfactory for friends.

44. In terms of section 117B  she  pointed  out  that  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant can speak English and is  currently  financially  independent
    are neutral factors but it counts against her that her leave in the  UK
    has always been precarious.

45. Mr Metzer added to his skeleton argument by making oral submissions. He
    helpfully conceded that the Appellant could not meet  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules as a  Tier  2  migrant.  However  he  did  not
    concede  that  there  were  no  very  significant  obstacles   to   her
    integration into India  bearing  in  mind  that  this  Appellant  is  a
    particular kind of woman.  She  is  someone  who  married  against  her
    parents' wishes and divorced with the stigma  that  attaches  to  that.
    Women do not have equal status in India and she does not  have  a  good
    relationship with her family.  The very significant obstacles would  be
    the stigma of divorce and having no support structure.

46. He then dealt with  the  question  of  whether  there  were  compelling
    circumstances to consider Article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules  and
    referred to paragraphs 53 and 54 of Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803  which
    indicate that there needs to be "compelling circumstances",  not  "very
    compelling circumstances" as in deportation appeals.

47. He did not dispute that her status has always been precarious  nor  did
    he dispute that the language and  financial  matters  were  neutral  if
    satisfied for the purposes of section 117B.

48. He submitted that the only reason the Appellant's  application  to  the
    Secretary of State  failed  was  because  she  had  been  deceived.  He
    submitted that if she  were  to  make  a  fresh  application  it  would
    probably succeed based on the evidence.

49. He submitted that it was  important  to  examine  the  quality  of  the
    Appellant's private life. She came to the UK to achieve  her  goals  to
    win respect from her family and to obtain a PhD.  Those  matters  would
    give her good standing to succeed in India and part of her private life
    is the realisation of her educational aspirations.

50. He submitted that when she came  to  the  UK  she  developed  a  deeper
    private life  in  terms  of  the  very  close  relationships  she  has,
    particularly with Mr Lazaro which is a father/daughter relationship. He
    referred to the comment in the Appellant's witness statement  that  her
    friends in the UK are like family. He asked me to attach weight to  the
    comment in her statement that it would be harder for her to  leave  her
    friends in the UK than it was to leave India.

51. He referred me to the various contributions she had made as a carer for
    Mr Samuel and also in  wider  society  working  for  the  Gurdwara  and
    various charitable organisations and church.

52. He asked me to find that she was credible and that  when  I  considered
    the evidence carefully I would find that it was not in conflict because
    she does hold her family dear and her friends would not necessarily  be
    aware of how she is perceived by her family.

53. In terms of section 117 he argued that the  only  matter  that  counted
    against the Appellant was the public interest  in  immigration  control
    which he argued was outweighed by the  extremely  rich  and  compelling
    private life that  she  has.  He  argued  that  she  is  an  impressive
    character who has  made  a  significant  positive  contribution  to  UK
    society and urged that her appeal be  allowed  and  she  be  granted  a
    reasonable period of leave to allow her to make a fresh application  to
    the Secretary of State.



Findings

54. As I made clear in my error of law decision there  is  something  of  a
    mountain to climb for an Appellant to succeed purely  on  private  life
    grounds. Statute, in the form of section 117B of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 instructs me to find little weight should  be  attached
    to a private life built up when an Appellant's  status  is  precarious.
    There is no doubt, indeed it is accepted, that her  status  has  always
    been precarious. She could have had no expectation when she came to the
    UK in January 2011 that she would be permitted to remain indefinitely.

55. While I have no doubts about the sincerity of the various witnesses and
    am satisfied that  they  came  to  court  with  genuine  intentions  of
    supporting the Appellant,  of  whom  they  are  clearly  fond,  in  her
    application to remain in the UK. However, I am less  impressed  by  the
    evidence of the Appellant herself.

56. It appears clear to me that she has manufactured a rift in  her  family
    relationships in order to aid her appeal. She was extremely evasive  in
    answering questions about the circumstances of herself and her daughter
    while she was still in India and about her daughter's situation  since.
    On the one hand her evidence was she worked so hard and for  such  long
    hours that she had no social life at all  in  India  and  therefore  no
    friends but on the other  hand  that  she  only  worked  school  hours.
    However another contradiction then arose in that she said when she  was
    at work she locked her daughter  in  the  house.   It  was  only  after
    considerable probing that she changed her evidence to say that she left
    her daughter at day-care. I find I can attach no weight to her evidence
    about that as it was so contradictory and evasive. It seems to  me  far
    more likely that when she went to work her  parents  looked  after  her
    daughter.

57. Nor do I accept that the Appellant had no friends in India.  She  lived
    there until she was 38 years of age, always  in  the  same  place.  She
    worked there for 10 years and would have had numerous colleagues. It is
    simply not credible that she acquired no friends and  acquaintances  in
    that time, particularly given the number she has acquired in the UK.

58. Based on the oral evidence I  am  very  far  from  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant is estranged from her family. It  is  quite  clear  from  the
    evidence of Mrs Ball and Mrs Goodlad that she  is  in  regular  contact
    with both her parents and her daughter. She talks  about  them  to  her
    friends and is clearly up-to-date with her family's situation. Also, in
    addition to her parents she has a sister in India.

59. It is not credible that, if she were estranged from  her  family  since
    1994 as claimed, she would have left her daughter in  their  care  when
    she came to the UK and nor is it credible that they would  have  agreed
    to have her. Additionally, to obtain leave to enter as  a  student  she
    must have satisfied the Entry Clearance Officer that she  had  funding.
    If her situation was as dire as she paints there is  no-one  who  could
    have supported her.

60.  The  Appellant's  evidence  was  also   contradictory   about   living
    independently in India. Her evidence to me was that it  was  all  right
    for her young 21-year-old daughter to live completely independently but
    that she as a 38-year-old, highly educated woman could not. That  makes
    no sense, particularly as her evidence was that she  lived  alone  with
    her daughter without help or support form 1996 until 2011.

61. Her claim that she could not work in India or live there as a  divorced
    woman is also without credibility as  her  evidence  is  that  she  did
    precisely that for 9 years as a separated woman and 3 as a divorcee.

62. The Appellant also claimed that despite having previously worked for 10
    years in India and being a first-class university graduate  in  physics
    and having an MBA from the UK and worked in various roles in the UK she
    would be unable to secure employment in India. That makes no sense  and
    is wholly incredible. Nor do I accept that her UK obtained MBA would be
    worthless in India. If that were true one wonders why she came  to  the
    UK to study for one.

63. Her claim that there are no volunteers and no voluntary work  in  India
    is wholly incredible.

64. I entirely reject her claim  that  she  would  be  unable  to  maintain
    contact with her UK-based friends from India. She no  longer  lives  in
    the same area as either Mr Lazaro or Mrs Goodlad and her  communication
    with Mr Kamal apart from seeing him when she shops where  he  works  is
    carried out by modern means of communication. If the Appellant has felt
    able, indeed happy to conduct a relationship with her immediate  family
    and her young daughter by modern means of communication then  there  is
    no reason why she should not do the same with her friends.

65. I am also concerned about the Appellant's credibility  with  regard  to
    her financial situation in the UK. Whilst she is now  working,  it  was
    claimed that the evidence demonstrated that a future application for  a
    visa to enable her to work would succeed. That  is  not  an  inevitable
    conclusion. Both employers  relied  upon  confirm  that  they  are  not
    sponsors. She has no conditional offer of employment from  someone  who
    is.

66. Her credibility is further damaged by her claim before me that she  has
    never been financially  dependent  upon  anyone.  She  was  financially
    dependent upon her friends when the matter came before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and that remained the case when  she  appeared  before  me  in
    June.

67. Pulling all the strands together therefore looking firstly, as I  must,
    at the Immigration Rules the only one that is applicable  is  paragraph
    276 ADE. I conclude that it does not avail the Appellant. The  relevant
    part is paragraph 276  ADE  (vi),  namely  that  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles to her integration in India. Clearly based on  my
    findings above there would not. She  is  highly  educated;  she  has  a
    family; she has a daughter; she speaks the language; she  has  been  in
    the UK for 6 years but was in India for 38 and she is  able  to  secure
    employment.

68. In terms of whether there are compelling reasons to consider Article  8
    outside the rules I find there are none  in  this  case.  I  accept  of
    course that "compelling" is different from "very  compelling".  However
    compelling means something quite forceful, quite significant.  In  this
    case the Appellant can point to nothing other  than  relationships  and
    acquaintances  that  she  has  made  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
    contribution which she has made to various charitable organisations and
    people. Whilst that is very  creditable,  it  is  nothing  out  of  the
    ordinary and is not a reason to afford her a right to stay.  Compelling
    circumstances would be something over and  above  the  private  life  a
    person would build up purely by the reason of being in  the  UK  for  a
    significant period of time. There are no health issues or other matters
    which could possibly persuade me that there are compelling  reasons  to
    consider Article 8 outside the Rules.

69.  Even  if  I  were  to  consider  Article  8  outside  the  Rules   and
    proportionality, the Appellant could not succeed. Section  117  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which  I  am  required  to  take  into
    account, instructs that the maintenance of immigration  control  is  in
    the public interest. I am instructed to attach a little weight  to  the
    Appellant's private life because her status has always been precarious.
    While there may be cases where a person's private life  might  outweigh
    the public interest in the maintenance of immigration control, such  as
    perhaps very severe physical or mental health difficulties this case is
    a very long way from that.

70. For all of the above reasons I find that the decision of the  Secretary
    of State to refuse leave to remain and remove the Appellant to India is
    entirely proportionate. Despite the large amount of  documentation  and
    witness evidence nothing at the resumed hearing has increased the value
    or  significance  of  the  Appellant's  private  life  above  what  was
    considered in the First-tier Tribunal which I have found would not have
    warranted the appeal being allowed.
