                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss Forster, instructed by Adamsons Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent, Asad Aleem, is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 24
    October 1982.  He is married to the  sponsor,  Iqra  Shahid  (hereafter
    referred to as the sponsor).  I shall refer to  the  appellant  as  the
    respondent and  the  respondent  as  the  appellant  as  they  appeared
    respectively before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant sought leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    spouse of the sponsor  but  his  application  was  rejected  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  He  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Hillis) which, in  a  determination  promulgated  on  1  December  2014
    allowed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  and  under  Article  8
    ECHR.  The Secretary of State now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 3. It was agreed before the First-tier Tribunal that the  appellant  could
    not succeed under the Immigration Rules because he failed to  meet  the
    income threshold of ï¿½18,600 per annum.   However,  Judge  Hillis  found
    that the appellant did succeed by reference to EX.1 (b);

         (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
         life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
         would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
         partner.

 4. Refusing the application, the Secretary of State, in her refusal letter
    dated 5 August 2014, stated that the appellant  had  not  "demonstrated
    any reasons why your relationship [with the sponsor] cannot continue in
    your country of origin.   You  therefore  fail  to  fulfil  EX.1(b)  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules."   It  is  apparent  from  Judge
    Hillis' determination [17-19] that he had considerable sympathy for the
    appellant, who  had  narrowly  missed  the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM and who appeared, as at the date of the First-tier Tribunal
    hearing, to be able  to  meet  those  requirements.   I  am  satisfied,
    however, that Judge Hillis did not allow his sympathy  for  this  "near
    miss" to colour his analysis and the remainder of the decision.

 5. Considering EX.1, the judge noted that there was  "no  issue  that  the
    appellant and the sponsor are in a genuine  and  subsisting  marriage."
    [21].  He noted [22] "that it was accepted that the  sponsor  is  a  UK
    citizen who has pursued her career in law with persistence and all  due
    diligence".  He noted that the sponsor was able to speak Urdu  but  was
    not able to read or write any dialect of a language  used  in  Pakistan
    and she had never lived there.   The  judge  noted  that  "the  sponsor
    states that she will  be  unable  to  find  appropriate  employment  in
    Pakistan and dress in the way she has for her whole  life  in  the  UK.
    She was ill when she visited Pakistan due  to  the  climate  and  local
    hygiene."  The judge noted that the respondent had suggested  a  number
    of different possible scenarios.  The first, the  couple  could  remove
    permanently  to  Pakistan  and  continue  their  family   life   there.
    Secondly, the couple could remove to Pakistan for  the  time  it  would
    take for  the  appellant  to  make  a  further  application  for  entry
    clearance.  Thirdly, the couple could separate for the brief period  it
    would take for the appellant to return to Pakistan alone  in  order  to
    make his application for entry clearance.

 6. None of these suggested scenarios found favour with Judge  Hillis.   He
    concluded [24] that there were "insurmountable obstacles" in  the  form
    of the "sponsor's career and personal circumstances as set out  above".
    He found that "her circumstances show, on the balance of probabilities,
    she would face very significant difficulties (paragraph  EX.2)."   That
    statement is problematic.  I have  quoted  above  the  passage  of  the
    decision regarding the sponsor's reasons  for  not  wishing  to  go  to
    Pakistan.  On the face of that evidence, the reasons do  not  obviously
    amount to "insurmountable obstacles" to her returning to Pakistan.  She
    is well educated and should be able to find a  job  there.   Having  to
    dress a way slightly different to that which she  is  used  to  in  the
    United Kingdom might be inconvenient but it is difficult to see that it
    would amount to a "very significant difficulty" for her.  The fact that
    she was ill on her last visit to Pakistan does  not,  of  course,  mean
    that she would necessarily be ill if she were to return to the  country
    or that she could not take reasonable  precautions  to  avoid  becoming
    ill.  There was no medical evidence to show that the  sponsor  has  any
    propensity for becoming ill in Pakistan on account of the heat or  poor
    hygiene there  or  for  any  other  reason.   In  the  light  of  those
    considerations, there is, in my opinion, an absence of clear  reasoning
    by Judge Hillis but such as to justify the findings which he  has  made
    at [24].

 7. At [25], Judge Hillis went on to state:

         "It is not for me to speculate as to the success  or  otherwise  or
         the timescale involved in the appellant  making  a  fresh  'out  of
         country' application.  Additionally, paragraph EX.1(i)(b) does  not
         state that the appellant leaving his wife behind in the UK would be
         a remedy to the  issue  of  the  insurmountable  obstacles  in  the
         continuation of family life outside the UK.  I therefore reject  Mr
         Barlow's [the  Presenting  Officer]  submission  that  the  current
         nature and quality of the appellant's family life with his wife can
         be maintained outside the UK by his returning to  Pakistan  without
         her to make a fresh application for leave to enter the  UK  as  her
         spouse."

 8. It is not for the judge to "speculate" "as to the success or  otherwise
    or the timescale involved and the  appellant  making  a  fresh  out  of
    country application".  That is a matter which  could  and  should  have
    been addressed in evidence.   If  the  appellant  wished  to  assert  a
    separation from the sponsor which his removal to Pakistan to make a new
    application  would  entail  would  amount  to   a   "very   significant
    difficulty" in the continuation "of their family life together  outside
    the UK" then it was for him to adduce evidence to prove that assertion.
     Examining again the wording of EX.2, I do not find  any  justification
    for Judge Hillis' rejection of the  scenario  by  which  the  appellant
    would return to Pakistan to make an application and the wording of  the
    paragraph.  Couples are very often  separated  for  brief  periods  and
    their family life may be carried on during such  separations  by  using
    letters, the internet or the telephone in order to stay in  touch.   In
    that way, family life can be continued "outside the UK", those means of
    communication  offering  a  method  by  which  "the  very   significant
    difficulties" (if any) could  be  "overcome."   Judge  Hillis  has  not
    considered whether separation of  the  couple  in  these  circumstances
    would "entail very serious hardship" for the appellant and the sponsor.
     I find that the judge unreasonably rejected the  Presenting  Officer's
    submission.

 9. I find, therefore, that the judge's determination of the  appeal  under
    the Immigration  Rules  should  be  set  aside.   I  have  remade  that
    decision.  In the light of my  findings  and  observations,  I  am  not
    satisfied,  on  the  evidence  before  me,  that  the   appellant   has
    established that there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    being continued in Pakistan.  I am not satisfied that the circumstances
    that the sponsor described by Judge Hillis at [22] give  rise  to  such
    insurmountable obstacles.  My primary finding is that the couple  would
    continue their family life in Pakistan.  Even if I  am  wrong  in  that
    finding, I find that many obstacles may be overcome  by  the  appellant
    and the sponsor adopting either of the two scenarios suggested  by  the
    Presenting Officer to  the  First-tier  Tribunal;  given  the  personal
    circumstances of the couple, it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant to return to Pakistan in order to  make  an  application  and
    given that he now claims to be able to meet the financial requirements.
     In the light of the fact the sponsor is working, the couple  returning
    together to Pakistan for that purpose might  be  more  problematic  but
    even so a brief stay in Pakistan by the sponsor is highly  unlikely  to
    render  any  of  the  inconveniences  of  which  he   complains   "very
    significant".

10. Judge Hillis also allowed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.  However, he
    only did so because he found that the appellant satisfied the  "Article
    8 provisions" of EX.1 of Appendix FM.  There was no  separate  analysis
    of Article 8 ECHR other than in the context of the  Immigration  Rules.
    In the light of my findings and observations, I am  satisfied  that  it
    would be proportionate for the appellant to be removed to  Pakistan  in
    consequence of the respondent's decision.

Notice of Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  which  was  promulgated  on  1
December 2014 is set aside.  I have remade the  decision.   The  appellant's
appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State dated  5  August  2014
is dismissed under the Immigration Rules and  on  human  rights  (Article  8
ECHR) grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
