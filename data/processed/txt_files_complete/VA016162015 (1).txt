                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal Moore (FtJ), promulgated on 14 November  2016,  dismissing
        the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  dated  4
        March 2015 refusing him entry clearance as a visitor.



   Factual Background


     2. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh, date of birth 1  January
        1959. In 2010 his wife entered the United  Kingdom  as  a  visitor,
        together with the Appellant, both having  been  issued  with  entry
        clearance as visitors. While in the United Kingdom the  Appellant's
        wife applied for a certificate of an  entitlement  to  a  right  of
        abode,  which  was  issued  in  May  2011.  In  his  2010   visitor
        application the Appellant told the entry  clearance  officer  (ECO)
        that he intended to stay in the UK for 4 weeks but he remained  for
        3� months. His wife did not return to Bangladesh.


     3. In 2015 the Appellant applied for entry clearance to visit his wife
        and adult daughter,  both  of  whom  are  resident  in  the  United
        Kingdom. The  Respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant
        provided a satisfactory explanation for  staying  longer  than  the
        period indicated in his earlier application. Nor was the Respondent
        satisfied that the Appellant was self-employed, or that he received
        his claimed income. As the Respondent was not  satisfied  that  the
        Appellant presented a complete and accurate picture of his personal
        and economic circumstances in Bangladesh,  she  was  not  satisfied
        that he planned to leave the UK at the end of his visit or that  he
        was genuinely seeking entry as a general visitor.


     4. The Appellant appealed this decision but could only do  so  on  the
        limited grounds that the decision was unlawful under section  6  of
        the Human Rights Act 1998 (public authority not to act contrary  to
        human rights Convention) as being incompatible with his  Convention
        rights.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

     5. Having first satisfied himself that he had jurisdiction to consider
        the grounds, the judge then heard  evidence  from  the  Appellant's
        wife (there was no witness statement from the  Appellant  himself).
        The judge noted the explanation provided by  the  Appellant's  wife
        for her husband staying 3�  months  (he  had  several  other  close
        relatives and wanted to visit all of them), and that he now  wanted
        to visit her because she was suffering  from  depression  and  back
        pain, problems that started around 2012/2013. The Appellant had not
        sought to visit his wife around that time, or  thereafter,  because
        she had planned to return to Bangladesh but later changed her mind.
        The Appellant previously visited the UK in 2007 and  complied  with
        the conditions of his  entry  clearance.  He  had  3  daughters  in
        Bangladesh aged 21, 18 and 16, and a married son 29 years old.  The
        wife stated that the Appellant looked after them in Bangladesh  and
        would continue to do so until his daughters got married.  When  the
        Appellant  previously  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  2010  his
        business was managed by his oldest son, and that would still be the
        case. The Appellant's wife was unable to visit  Bangladesh  because
        of her own "personal commitment and adverse health conditions".


     6. At  paragraph  17  the  judge  stated  his  satisfaction  that  the
        Appellant's self-employment, income and family  circumstances  were
        as claimed. The judge accepted that the Appellant had a business in
        a local bazaar earning the equivalent of �200 a month, and that  he
        received additional rental income from properties.  The  judge  was
        additionally satisfied that the Appellant lived with his  3  single
        daughters and had done so for many years.


     7. At paragraph 18 the judge noted that the Appellant remained in  the
        UK in 2010 for longer than initially stated. "I therefore  find  it
        surprising that if it was the Appellant's intention  to  visit  all
        his close relatives, including 4 sisters and 2 brothers in the  UK,
        that this was the reason that he actually stayed 3�  months  rather
        than 4 weeks." The judge appeared to doubt the wife's claim to have
        originally planned to return to Bangladesh, and stated that, if she
        had changed her mind, there was "no reasonable explanation" why the
        Appellant did not visit her in the UK soon after 2012/2013.


     8. At paragraph 20 the judge was not satisfied that  the  Respondent's
        decision amounted to an interference with the Appellant's right  to
        respect for family life. This was supported  by  reference  to  the
        wife's decision to live in the UK and the absence of any reasonable
        explanation why the Appellant chose not to visit the  UK  prior  to
        his application in 2015. Nor was the judge satisfied that the  wife
        provided any reliable evidence why she could not visit him and  her
        daughters in Bangladesh. In arriving at this  decision,  the  judge
        briefly  considered  the  medical  evidence  from  the  Whitechapel
        practice and the wife's medical condition. The judge noted that the
        refusal of the appeal would result in the  Appellant  remaining  in
        Bangladesh and continuing to live with his 3 daughters and  running
        his business. There would therefore be no material change  for  the
        Appellant and he and his wife could continue to communicate in  the
        same manner as they had done the previous 6 years.


     9. At paragraph 22  the  judge  stated,  "Having  considered  all  the
        evidence before me, and presuming  article  8  was  engaged,  I  am
        satisfied that the decision of the Respondent  was  lawful  on  the
        grounds of  effective  immigration  control,  and  the  decision  a
        proportionate one."


    10. At paragraph 23 the judge stated, "I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
        Appellant is genuinely seeking entry and intends to leave the UK at
        the end of that visit."

The grounds of appeal and the error of law hearing

    11. The grounds contend that the judge failed  to  properly  apply  the
        principles established in Mostafa (Article 8  in  entry  clearance)
        [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC), failed  to  consider  that  the  Appellant
        previously visited the UK in compliance with the immigration rules,
        failed  to  consider  the  explanation  in  the   covering   letter
        accompanying the application for the Appellant's  longer  visit  in
        2010, and, having  found  that  the  Appellant's  circumstances  in
        Bangladesh were as claimed, that he was not then entitled to refuse
        the appeal on human rights grounds.


    12. Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce  granted  permission  in  the  following
        terms.


           Although no express finding is made it would appear that the
           Tribunal proceeded on the basis that the Appellant is a genuine
           visitor. The appeal is dismissed on the ground that there is no
           interference in his family life because his wife can visit him
           in Bangladesh. It is arguable that in making that finding the
           tribunal has failed to give reasons: it is arguable that it has
           not engaged with the sponsors assertion that she is unable to
           travel for medical reasons.


    13. At the error of law hearing Mr Karim submitted that the  Respondent
        had not taken issue with the  timing  of  the  Appellant's  visitor
        application (this was a point raised by the judge on the day of the
        hearing), and that the judge failed to properly consider the wife's
        medical conditions, including the evidence that she  was  suffering
        from anxiety and depression because she missed seeing her  husband.
        Mr Melvin provided a  copy  of  Kopoi  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1511  and
        submitted that the medical evidence did not show that the wife  was
        unable to travel and that the  judge  was  entitled  to  raise  the
        credibility concerns at the hearing.

Discussion

    14. I am satisfied, for the following reasons, that the  decision  does
        contain material errors of law. At paragraph 5 the  judge  accepted
        that the Appellant was closely related to his family in the UK, and
        in particular his wife and daughter. The judge  then  says,  "I  am
        satisfied that human rights are engaged, notwithstanding that  this
        is  a  visitor  Visa  application  and  not  for  the  purposes  of
        settlement." The judge then makes reference to AG (Eritrea) v  SSHD
        [2007] EWCA Civ 801, which establishes that, while an  interference
        with private or family life must be real if it is to engage article
        8(1), the threshold of engagement (the "minimum level")  is  not  a
        specially high one. The judge then indicates that article 8(1)  may
        be engaged. These observations appear at variance with the  judge's
        conclusion, at paragraph 20, that the refusal  of  entry  clearance
        does not amount to an interference with the  Appellant's  right  to
        respect for family  life.  The  decision  appears  to  contain  two
        inconsistent findings as to whether Article 8(1) is engaged.  While
        the judge may have been attempting to outline his  jurisdiction  to
        consider the appeal on human rights  grounds  at  paragraph  5,  it
        remains insufficiently clear why he found, on the  one  hand,  that
        article 8(1) was engaged, but then later found it was not engaged.


    15. The judge sought to  support  his  conclusion  that  there  was  no
        interference with article 8 by reference  to  the  absence  of  any
        reasonable explanation as to why the Appellant chose not  to  visit
        the UK from the time that his wife developed her  medical  problems
        until his application in 2015, and the absence of reliable evidence
        demonstrating why she  could  not  visit  him  in  Bangladesh.  The
        Respondent did not however rely  on  the  absence  of  any  visitor
        application made between 2012/13 and 2015 as a reason for  doubting
        the Appellant's intentions,  either  in  her  Reasons  For  Refusal
        Letter or the Entry Clearance Manager's review. The  judge  appears
        to have raised this issue during the  hearing.  While  a  judge  is
        unarguably entitled to raise concerns  in  respect  of  a  person's
        intentions during  a  hearing,  including  new  issues,  procedural
        fairness dictates that  the  person  is  given  an  opportunity  to
        provide an explanation before it  is  held  against  them.  As  the
        Appellant was in Bangladesh he was  not  given  an  opportunity  to
        provide  an  explanation  for  the  delay  in  making   a   visitor
        application between 2012/13 and 2015. Although the Appellant's wife
        offered an explanation (she planned to visit Bangladesh but changed
        her mind after the onset of her medical  problems),  the  Appellant
        himself had no opportunity to explain why he  did  not  attempt  to
        visit his wife until 2015.


    16. Nor is it satisfactorily clear how the adverse credibility findings
        that the judge appears to have made in respect of  the  explanation
        offered by the Appellant for staying longer than 4 weeks  in  2010,
        and the explanation offered on behalf of the Appellant by his  wife
        for not  applying  to  visit  the  UK  between  2012/13  and  2015,
        undermine the  Appellant's  claimed  intentions  in  light  of  the
        judge's findings that the Appellant's circumstances  in  Bangladesh
        were as claimed. In particular, the judge does not explain  why  he
        concludes that the Appellant is not genuinely seeking entry to  the
        UK as a visitor in circumstances where the Appellant  has  to  care
        for 3 single daughters in Bangladesh, including a minor.


    17. For these reasons I am satisfied  that  the  judge  has  materially
        erred in law. In all the circumstances, and having  regard  to  the
        views of the parties, it is appropriate to remit the case  back  to
        the First-tier Tribunal for a completely fresh hearing, all  issues
        at large, before  a  judge  other  than  judge  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal Moore.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by material errors of law.  The
case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh (de  novo)  hearing,
all issues open, to be heard by a judge other than Judge of  the  First-tier
Tribunal Moore.
