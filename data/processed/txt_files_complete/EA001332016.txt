                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction regarding anonymity - rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court  proceedings.   An
anonymity order is  made  because  the  matter  involves  sensitive  medical
information.

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the USA born on 29th  October  1994.   On
    22nd July 2015 she applied for a residence card as  confirmation  of  a
    right to reside in the  United  Kingdom  on  the  basis  of  being  the
    stepdaughter of an EEA national, Mr F M M U, a French and EEA national,
    hereinafter called the sponsor. Her application  was  refused  on  11th
    December 2015 and Ms J appealed.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Chapman allowed  the  appellant's  appeal  on
    22nd February 2016 but the Secretary of State  appealed  on  the  basis
    that she was not satisfied that the appellant had discharged the burden
    upon her of establishing the EEA national's employment and thus that he
    was exercising treaty rights.

 3. As the First-tier Tribunal Judge found, when the  respondent  conducted
    the necessary checks to process the application, the sponsor no  longer
    worked for the employer and yet by 16th December 2015, only a few  days
    after the respondent's decision, the sponsor had been made an offer  of
    employment with a new employer.  As such the judge allowed  the  appeal
    noting that the sponsor was working when the application was  made  and
    signed a contract for a new job.

 4. An application for permission to appeal was made by  the  Secretary  of
    State, however, on the basis that at the date of  the  application  the
    appellant was under the age  of  21  and  her  claim  considered  under
    Regulation 7(1)(b)(i) of the EEA Regulations but by  the  date  of  her
    hearing, the circumstances changed and in accordance with  Boodhoo  and
    another (EEA Regs: relevant evidence) [2013] UKUT 00346 (IAC) the judge
    was required to look at the factors as at the date of  appeal  hearing.
    This meant that the matter should have been considered under Regulation
    7(1)(b)(ii) and dependency established.  As  such  the  judge  made  an
    error of law.

 5. It is clear that the judge  was  obliged  following  Reyes  (EEA  Regs:
    dependency) [2013] UKUT 314 (IAC) to consider the matter as it  was  at
    the date of the hearing as the appellant had appealed.   By  that  date
    and further to Regulation 7 the appellant was over the age  of  21  and
    needed to establish that she was dependent on her  sponsor.   Mr  Kotas
    produced the decision of Lim v Entry Clearance  Officer  Manila  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 1383 and particularly referred to paragraph  32  stating  that
    the critical question was  whether  the  claimant  was  in  fact  in  a
    position to support herself or not.  As stated in Lim:

         "32.     In my judgment,  the  critical  question  is  whether  the
             claimant is in fact in a position to support himself  or  not,
             and Reyes now makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view.  That
             is a simple matter of fact.  If he can support himself,  there
             is no dependency, even  if  he  is  given  financial  material
             support by the EU citizen.  Those additional resources are not
             necessary to enable him to meet his basic needs.  If,  on  the
             other hand, he cannot support himself from his own  resources,
             the court will not ask why that  is  the  case,  save  perhaps
             where there is an abuse of rights.  The fact that  he  chooses
             not to get a job and become self-supporting is irrelevant.  It
             follows  that  on  the  facts  of  this  case,  there  was  no
             dependency.  The appellant had the funds to  support  herself.
             She  was  financially  independent  and  did  not   need   the
             additional resources for the  purpose  of  meeting  her  basic
             needs."

 6. The question is whether the appellant was dependent in relation to  her
    basic needs or rather in a position to support herself  or  not.   This
    was not established by the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   I  therefore
    found an error of law and set aside the decision of the judge.  It  was
    established that as at the date of the hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, that the  sponsor  was  a  qualified  person  and  this
    finding from the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  preserved
    because was open to the judge to accept the  job  offer  as  sufficient
    proof of work and place what weight he did on the evidence provided.

 7. As the point on dependency was not taken  by  the  Secretary  of  State
    before the First-tier Tribunal, although the objection had  been  valid
    because the law applicable differed, it  was  understandable  that  the
    evidence was  not  previously  before  the  Secretary  of  State.   The
    decision was being  remade  but,  in  fairness  and  the  interests  of
    justice, the case was adjourned  to  allow  the  appellant  to  produce
    evidence regarding her dependency.

 8. At the resumed hearing before me further evidence was submitted to  the
    Tribunal, as directed in compliance with  Regulation  15(2)(a)  of  The
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules.  I  admitted  this  evidence
    and the appellant gave oral evidence.

 9. She stated that until very recently she had been employed on a  minimum
    wage.  She was fully dependent on her parents for her essential  needs.
    Her parents supplied her accommodation and food  in  London.   She  had
    been hoping to start a college course in September but because  of  her
    circumstances of the appeal had to defer this until January 2017.   Her
    parents would be assisting in funding her course which she would  study
    in London and where she would live with her  mother  and  step  father.
    She was not working at present and if she worked when  at  college,  it
    would be part-time and she  would  continue  to  be  dependent  on  her
    parents. In response to cross examination by  Mr  Kotas  she  confirmed
    that three times she had attempted to become self sufficient  and  each
    time had failed.

10. Mr Kotas accepted that the appellant was credible in her oral evidence.



11. I have referred to the case law above and the  relevant  regulation  in
    this matter is as follows

         Regulation 7.- Family member
         (1) Subject to paragraph (2), for the purposes of these
         Regulations the following persons shall be treated as the family
         members of another person-
          (a) his spouse or his civil partner;
          (b) direct descendants of his, his spouse or his civil partner
         who are-
                (i) under 21; or
                (ii) dependants of his, his spouse or his civil partner;
          (c) dependent direct relatives in his ascending line or that of
          his spouse or his civil partner;
          (d) a person who is to be treated as the family member of that
          other person under paragraph (3).

12. I accept the evidence given by the appellant.  Her  oral  evidence  was
    consistent with her written evidence and candid.  She  told  the  court
    that she was both financially and emotionally dependent on her parents.
    Although the appellant is 21  years  old,  the  documentation  supplied
    demonstrated that as recently as 2015 she had been  hospitalised  in  a
    Psychiatric Clinic for  depression.   Her  mother's  witness  statement
    confirmed that the appellant had worked in a  series  of  minimum  wage
    jobs (remaining still in effect reliant on her parents) and had  become
    heavily involved in drugs and alcohol whilst in the USA but since being
    in the United Kingdom  was  free  from  substance  abuse.   Her  mother
    confirmed that since living with her parents the appellant  had  earned
    just enough to buy her own clothing and personal items but  not  enough
    to support herself  independently.   She  paid  no  rent  nor  for  any
    utilities.  As her mother stated

       'B does not now and has never earned enough to support  herself,  and
           is a dependent for all purposes despite having reached  the  age
           of 21 years'.

That evidence was entirely consistent with the evidence  of  the  appellant,
    whose evidence Mr Kotas accepted.

13. The appellant remains dependent on her mother and step father, the  EEA
    national, despite attempting to work, at least in part because  of  her
    mental  health  difficulties.   Those  difficulties  are  independently
    documented. The statements  of  the  appellant  and  her  mother  would
    suggest that her dependency is not one of choice and as  the  appellant
    stated, three times she had attempted to be independent but had failed.



14. The findings preserved from the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Chapman at [6] and [11] and in respect of the  working  status  of  the
    step father are as follows

       'on 16 December 2015, the sponsor was made  an  offer  of  employment
           with Tableau Software UK  Limited  in  the  capacity  of  Senior
           Manager, D M M, commencing on 31 December 2015, at a  salary  of
           �84,000 per annum.  The correspondence  includes  the  sponsor's
           signature, dated 17 December 2015, showing that he accepted  the
           offer of  employment  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of  such
           employment' [6].

And further

       'Taking all of these circumstances into account, and noting that  the
           sponsor was working when  the  application  was  made,  and  has
           signed a contract for a new job, I am satisfied on the basis  of
           the documentation provided, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,
           that the sponsor is a worker and therefore  a  qualified  person
           for the purposes of Regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations' [11].

15. I conclude that for  the  purposes  of  Regulation  7  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, the appellant  is  a  direct
    descendent of the spouse of a  qualified  EEA  national  who  is  also,
    within the confines of the relevant case law, dependent on  her  mother
    and step father.

16. I have, in a previous decision dated 5th September 2016 set  aside  the
    First-tier Tribunal  decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the
    Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE  2007)  and  I  herewith
    remake the decision under section 12(2) (b) (ii) of the  TCE  2007  and
    allow the appeal.
