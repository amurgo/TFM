Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr R Singer, Counsel instructed by Liberty Legal
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused to grant the appellant a residence card as an
    extended family member of an EEA national. The appellant appealed to
    the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT"). In a decision promulgated on 6 July
    2015, FtT Judge Brown dismissed the appeal. The appellant now appeals
    that decision.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 5 April 1984. He entered
    the UK on 26 August 2006 on a student visa.

 3. The EEA family member sponsoring the appellant is a cousin with
    Norwegian citizenship who entered the UK in December 2013 (hereinafter
    "the sponsor").

 4. On 6 August 2014 the appellant applied for a residence card as
    confirmation of a right to reside in the UK as an extended family
    member of the sponsor. The application was rejected by the respondent
    on the basis that the appellant had not established he had been
    dependent on or a household member of the sponsor either before or
    after entering the UK and therefore that the requirements of Regulation
    8(2) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations")
    were not satisfied.

Regulation 8(2) of the 2006 Regulations

 5. This appeal concerns the application and interpretation of Regulation
    8(2) of the 2006 Regulations. This states as follows:



         8(2) A person satisfies the condition in  this  paragraph  if  the
         person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse  or  his  civil
         partner and-

         (a)the person is residing in a country other than the United
         Kingdom and is dependent upon the EEA national or is a member of
         his household;

         (b)the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and is
         accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom or wishes to
         join him there; or

         (c)the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a), has joined
         the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to be
         dependent upon him or to be a member of his household.


Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 6. Having heard oral evidence from the sponsor and appellant and
    considered the documentary evidence before the Tribunal, including
    receipts of money transfers from the sponsor to the appellant, the
    judge concluded that:

      a) Between 2002 and 2006, whilst the appellant was a student at the
         University of the Punjab in Pakistan, he was financially dependent
         on the sponsor.

      b) Between August 2006 and December 2013, whilst the appellant, but
         not the sponsor, was living in the UK, the appellant was neither
         dependent on nor a household member of the sponsor.

      c) The appellant is currently a household member of the sponsor.

 7. As there was a gap of several years between the past dependency and the
    present household membership, the judge found that the appellant was
    not a family member of the sponsor within the meaning of Regulation
    8(2).

Grounds of appeal

 8. There are two grounds of appeal. The first ground concerns the judge's
    finding that the appellant was not dependent on the sponsor between
    2006 and 2013. The grounds submit that the judge's approach to the
    evidence in respect of this period was flawed. In particular, it is
    submitted that he overlooked the appellant's and sponsor's evidence and
    relied solely on the documentary evidence in the form of remittance
    receipts.

 9. The second ground of appeal argues that the judge misconstrued
    Regulation 8(2) by finding that it imposed the requirement of an
    unbroken period of continuous dependency/household membership.

Submissions

10. At the error of law hearing, Mr Singer, on behalf of the appellant,
    focused on the second ground; that is, the proper construction of
    Regulation 8(2). He argued that Regulation 8(2) does not require there
    be continuity between past and present dependency/household membership.
    He submitted that, following Dauhoo (EEA Regulations 8(2)) [2012] UKUT
    79, it is sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that he was
    dependent on or a household member of an EEA national whilst residing
    outside the UK (prior connection) and that he is currently dependent on
    or a household member of an EEA national (present connection). He
    contended that by requiring there to be continuity between the past and
    present connection, the judge was effectively imposing an additional
    requirement on the appellant.

11. Mr Singer illustrated his argument by suggesting that if the draftsman
    of the 2006 Regulations had intended there to be a requirement of
    uninterrupted continuity that would have been reflected in the wording,
    which, for example, could have stipulated that the applicant must be
    "continuously dependent on the sponsor throughout".

12. He also argued that a requirement of continuity would undermine the
    purpose of the 2006 Regulations. As applicants and sponsors can enter
    the UK at different times, there will inevitably be gaps in the
    provision of financial support or household membership. Regulation 8(2)
    should not be given an interpretation the consequence of which would
    exclude individuals in such circumstances from the definition of an
    extended family member.

13. In respect of the first ground, Mr Singer argued that the judge erred
    by effectively requiring there to be corroborative documentary evidence
    of the claimed financial support. He also submitted that the judge
    ought to have assessed the witnesses' credibility and considered the
    matter in the round. If the judge found the appellant and sponsor to be
    credible in relation to their evidence as to dependency/household
    membership before 2006 and after 2013, that should have been factored
    into the judge's assessment of the appellant and sponsor's credibility
    on the question of whether there was dependency between those two
    dates.

14. Mr Singer, relying on Lim (EEA-dependency) [2013] UKUT 00437 (IAC),
    also submitted that the judge erred in law by rejecting the claimed
    dependency between 2010 and 2012. His argument was that the judge
    mistakenly found that for dependency to arise it was necessary for the
    appellant to show he was wholly or mainly dependent on the sponsor. Mr
    Singer contended that, following Lim, the transfers between 2010 and
    2012 for which there was documentary evidence were sufficient to
    substantiate there being dependency.

15. Mr Jarvis, on behalf the respondent, argued that Mr Singer's reliance
    on Dauhoo was misplaced. Dauhoo concerned an entirely different issue:
    that of whether, under Regulation 8(2), it is necessary to show an
    applicant's prior and present connection to the sponsor was in the same
    category. That case did not address, and therefore does not assist in
    resolving, the question of whether Regulation 8(2) imposes a
    requirement of continuity between the prior and present connection.

16. Mr Jarvis argued that the wording of Regulation 8(2)(c) is clear that
    the dependency or household membership must be continuing.

17. He acknowledged that dependency should be given a holistic meeting but
    did not accept that it could cover a seven year gap. He made reference
    to the underlying purpose of the Regulation, which is to facilitate EEA
    citizens exercising Treaty Rights and submitted that in this case there
    had been no hindrance to the sponsor's exercise of those rights.

Consideration

18. The appellant submitted, in support of his claim, evidence of money
    transfers to him from the sponsor. These showed several transfers
    between 2002 and 2006; none in 2007, 2008 and 2009; and four in the
    period between 2010 and 2014.

19. The appellant's explanation for the absence of documentary evidence
    covering the period between 2007 and 2010 was that remittance receipts
    were not retained as he never anticipated they would one day be
    required. Having heard oral evidence from the appellant and sponsor,
    the judge reached the conclusion that the appellant's explanation for
    the lack of receipts was unsatisfactory.

20. The judge did not, as argued by Mr Singer, reject the appellant's
    account because of an absence of corroboration. Rather, the judge, in
    assessing the evidence before him, took into account, and attached
    considerable weight to, the absence of documents he would have expected
    to see. There was no error of law in so doing. See, for example, TK
    (Burundi) [2009] EWCA Civ 40 at [16] ("Where evidence to support an
    account given by a party is or should readily be available, a Judge is,
    in my view, plainly entitled to take into account the failure to
    provide that evidence and any explanations for that failure.")

21. The test of whether the appellant was dependent on the sponsor between
    2006 and 2013 is a purely factual one based on an examination of all of
    the factual circumstances. See Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT
    314 (IAC). It is clear from the decision that the judge has considered,
    in detail, the evidence before him concerning the relationship between
    the appellant and sponsor. With respect to the transfers to the
    appellant between 2010 and 2013, which were never more than �300 a year
    and were made at the time the appellant was living in Greater London,
    the judge was entitled to conclude that the payments amounted to no
    more than some financial assistance and were not in themselves evidence
    of dependency. Contrary to the argument made by Mr Singer, there is no
    inconsistency between this finding and comment in Lim at paragraph [24]
    that "If a person requires material support for essential needs in
    part, that is sufficient [for dependency to arise]"

22. It was a matter for the judge to determine how much weight to attach to
    the appellant's and sponsor's evidence, as well as to the absence of
    documentary evidence. No material evidence was overlooked and we are
    satisfied that the judge, who carried out a wide ranging and fact
    specific assessment of the appellant's circumstances, made a finding
    about dependency between 2006 and 2013 that was open to him for the
    reasons he gave.

23. The second ground of appeal concerns interpretation of the word
    "continues" in Regulation 8(2)(c).

24. In order to meet the definition of an extended family member under
    8(2)(c) three conditions must be satisfied.

      i. The first condition is that the applicant must have been dependent
         on or a household member of the EEA national before coming to the
         UK (that is, he must have satisfied the condition in Regulation
         8(2)(a)). The judge found that up until the date the appellant
         moved to the UK he was dependent on the sponsor. It is not in
         dispute that the appellant was able to satisfy this condition.

     ii. The second condition is that the applicant must have joined the EEA
         national in the UK. The term "has joined" in 8(2)(c) can apply
         irrespective of the order in which an applicant and his EEA
         national sponsor enter the UK (see Aladeselu [2013] EWCA Civ 144).
         In this case, even though the sponsor arrived in the UK seven years
         after the appellant, it has been accepted - and is not in dispute -
         that the appellant has joined the sponsor for the purposes of
         Regulation 8(2)(c).

    iii. The third condition is that the applicant "continues to be
         dependent upon [the EEA national] or to be a member of his
         household".

25. The word "continues" is not defined in the EEA Regulations.  Apart from
    Dauhoo (discussed below), the parties have not identified, and we are
    not aware of, any cases which have considered how "continues" should be
    interpreted.

26. In Dauhoo the Upper Tribunal considered the meaning of "continues" and
    found that it does not denote that:

         "...a person can only meet the requirement to show present
         dependency if that is a "continued dependency" and, likewise, that
         a person can only meet the requirement to show present membership
         of an EEA national 's household if that is a "continued membership"

27. The analysis in Dauhoo is not of assistance in the present case as it
    concerns the specific issue of whether continuity of
    dependency/household membership must be of the same category or whether
    there can be continuity between past dependency and present household
    membership, or vice versa. Dauhoo does not address the question before
    us, which is whether Regulation 8(2)(c) can be satisfied if there was
    an intervening period between the past and present dependency/household
    membership in which there was neither dependency or household
    membership.

28. The plain and natural meaning of "continues" is to persist or carry on
    with a state of affairs that is already in existence. A state of
    affairs does not "continue" if it ceases and then, at a later date,
    commences again. In such circumstances, the state of affairs can be
    said to have re-started, but it is not continuing.

29. Applying the ordinary meaning of "continues" to Regulation 8(2)(c)
    leads to the conclusion that, in order to satisfy the conditions
    therein, there must be continuity between the prior household
    membership/dependency and the present household membership/dependency.
    If there is an intervening period between two distinct periods in which
    there is neither dependency nor household membership, 8(2)(c) will not
    be satisfied.

30. Mr Singer argued that if continuity was required by Regulation 8(2)(c)
    more specific wording would have been used in order to give clarity. We
    do not accept this argument. Whilst there are arguably better
    formulations of wording than "continues to be" to convey that there
    must be continuity between the past and present dependency/household
    membership, the word "continues", given its ordinary meaning, makes
    clear that continuity is required. Had the drafters intention been to
    not require continuity, the words "continues to be" would have been
    omitted from 8(2)(c) and replaced with the word "is".

31. Whether dependency or household membership is found to "continue" is a
    factual question, which should be determined using the same approach as
    that used when considering whether there is dependency. That approach,
    as explained in Reyes, is a holistic one where a broad examination is
    undertaken of a number of factors, including financial, physical and
    social conditions, and

         "where the essential focus is on the nature of the relationship
         concerned and on whether it is one characterised by a situation of
         dependence based on an examination of all the factual
         circumstances, bearing in mind the underlying objective of
         maintaining the unity of the family."

32. Mr Singer argued that requiring continuity between past and present
    dependency/household membership would be contrary to the intention of
    the 2006 Regulations because there may be interruptions in financial
    transfers at the time the EEA national is settling down in the UK and
    such interruptions should not result in an applicant falling outside
    the definition of an extended family member. The difficulty with Mr
    Singer's argument is that whether there is continuity is a fact
    specific question involving consideration of all the relevant factors.
    Interruptions in financial transfers, particularly if they can be
    explained by pressures on the EEA national arising from the
    circumstances of adapting to his new country of residence, would not
    necessarily mean that dependency/household membership had not
    continued. Indeed, in some cases, when the relationship between the
    applicant and EEA national is considered holistically,
    dependency/household membership may be found to "continue" even though
    there are prolonged periods where there are no financial transfers.
    Every case will need to be determined on its own facts, having regard
    to the specific and particular circumstances, and taking into account
    the underlying objective of maintaining family unity.

33. In this case, it is clear from the factual findings of the judge, which
    we have accepted, that the appellant, after arriving in the UK, did not
    continue to be dependent on the sponsor. Rather, he commenced a lengthy
    period in which he was not dependent on or a household member of the
    sponsor. Only several years later, when the sponsor moved to the UK,
    did he become a member of his household. There is a clear demarcation
    between a period of prior dependency (2002 - 2006), a period without
    any dependency or household membership (2006-2013) and a period of
    household membership (2013 to the present).

34. In these circumstances, where there is a clear absence of continuity
    for a substantial duration between two distinct periods of dependency
    or household membership, the requirements of Regulation 8(2)(c) are not
    satisfied. Accordingly, we find that the judge was entitled to conclude
    that the appellant is not an extended family member of the sponsor.

Decision

35. The appeal is dismissed.

36. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of a
    material error of law and shall stand.

37. No anonymity direction is made.
