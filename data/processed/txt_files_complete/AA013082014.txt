                            the immigration Acts


                                                   Determination promulgated
                                                            On 18th May 2015


                                   Before

                                   Between

                                     VM
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

               The Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent



                            NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT


1.    By an "Error of law Decision" promulgated on  12  November  2014,  the
    Upper Tribunal set aside the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (promulgated on 29  August  2014)  by  which  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissed the appeal of the appellant on asylum  grounds,  humanitarian
    protection grounds and human rights grounds.

2.    Accordingly, the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision
    to remove her dated 13 February 2014 was outstanding before  the  Upper
    Tribunal, pending a hearing to re-make the decision on the appeal.

3.    By a letter  dated  13  May  2015,  the  appellant's  representatives,
    Vasuki Solicitors, informed the Upper Tribunal that the  applicant  had
    been granted  refugee  status  and  stating  that  they  are  therefore
    withdrawing her appeal.

4.    Given that the appellant was granted refugee  status  (from  which  it
    follows that she would have been granted  leave)  and  given  that  the
    terms of the letter from the appellant's solicitors makes it clear that
    section 104(4B) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    (the "2002"  Act)  cannot  apply,  her  appeal  is  deemed  statutorily
    abandoned, by operation of law, under section 104 (4A) of the 2002 Act.
     There is no question of her withdrawing her appeal.

5.    The hearing on 21 May 2015 will therefore be vacated.

    Decision:

    The appeal is abandoned.


                                                                       [pic]

                                                                    15.05.15
