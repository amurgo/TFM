For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal has a lengthy history.  It  was  heard  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as long ago as the 1  July  2015  and  then  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Hall in January 2016. Most recently the Court of  Appeal
    considered an appeal against the decision of DUTJ Hall and, by way of a
    decision given orally on 1st May 2018, set aside both the  decision  of
    the Upper Tribunal and that of the First-tier Tribunal.  The  Court  of
    Appeal further directed that  the  appeal  be  remitted  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal to be determined de novo.  The order in this regard was sealed
    on 3 May 2018.

 2. Since that time the Upper Tribunal has  been  seeking  a  copy  of  the
    judgment given by the Court of Appeal but alas this has proved elusive.
    As a consequence, a CMR was listed in the Upper Tribunal for  26  April
    2019. At the CMR Ms Everett provided a copy of what was said to be  the
    oral judgment of the Court of Appeal. She was not able to identify  the
    author of the document and could not attest to  its  accuracy,  neither
    could Mr Habtemariam.

 3. In all the circumstances, the parties agreed that given the  length  of
    time since the  appeal  was  last  heard  and  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    direction that the re-making of the decision should  be  de  novo,  the
    most appropriate course is for this task to be undertaken in the First-
    tier Tribunal. I agree and I therefore remit this appeal to the  First-
    tier Tribunal to be determined afresh.

Notice of Decision

This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to determined afresh.  No
previous findings are to stand.
