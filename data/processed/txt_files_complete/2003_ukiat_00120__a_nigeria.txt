                                                                  Respondent




                         DETERMINATION  AND REASONS


  1. The Appellant, a citizen of Nigeria,  appeals,  with  leave,  on  human
     rights grounds against the determination of  an  Adjudicator,  Mr  J  P
     Cameron, dismissing his appeal against the decision of  the  Respondent
     on 13 May 2002 to refuse leave to remain as a foreign spouse.

  2. Mr S Joseph represented the Appellant.  Mr  P  Deller,  a  Home  Office
     Presenting Officer, represented the Respondent.

  3. The Appellant entered the UK illegally on  14  November  1993  using  a
     passport to which he was not entitled.  He  applied  for  asylum  on  3
     November 1994.  His application was refused in March 1997.  His  appeal
     to an Adjudicator was heard later that year and dismissed on the  basis
     that his claim lacked any credibility. The  appeal  was  certified  and
     accordingly there was no further right of appeal to the Tribunal.

  4. In the meantime, in 1995 he had begun a relationship with Ms  O.  Their
     first child was born on 15 July 1996. They were  married  on  6  August
     1997, when his wife obtained a decree absolute in relation to her first
     marriage. A second child was born on 22 March 1998, and a  third  child
     was born on 15 April 1999. He made an application for leave  to  remain
     as a foreign spouse in  October  1997  and  this  was  refused  by  the
     Respondent, as described above, on 13  May  2002.  Another  Adjudicator
     heard the Appellant's appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  against  this
     decision on 8 January 2003.  In  that  determination,  with  regard  to
     Article 8, the Adjudicator dismissed the appeal on the basis that there
     was no reason why the Appellant could not return to Nigeria and make an
     application from there for leave to enter as spouse in the  normal  way
     under the Immigration Rules. Permission to appeal to the  Tribunal  was
     granted on 18 March 2003.  On 19 September 2003, the Appellant  made  a
     new application to the Respondent for indefinite leave to remain on the
     basis of a published concession, namely that he had been in the UK  for
     more than seven years with children attending school. No  decision  has
     been reached in relation to this last application.

  5. At the outset of the proceedings,  Mr  Joseph  accepted  that  the  new
     application under the seven-year concession was not before the Tribunal
     as  there  had  been  no  decision  on  it  by  the  Respondent.   Both
     representatives accepted that the only issue before  the  Tribunal  was
     the question of proportionality  under  Article  8,  arising  from  the
     Adjudicator's conclusion that  it  would  not  be  disproportionate  to
     expect the Appellant to return to Nigeria and make an  application  for
     entry to the  UK  as  a  spouse  from  there  in  accordance  with  the
     Immigration Rules.

  6. Mr Joseph argued that the Appellant was the breadwinner of  his  family
     and employed in a good position. He was employed by M Ltd and last year
     earned �31,396.  His wife worked  part-time  and  earned  about  �6000.
     They owned their own home but it was subject  to  a  mortgage.  If  the
     Appellant were returned, even for a limited period, the family would be
     deprived of much of its income and  may  require  support  from  public
     funds.  The life enjoyed by the family would be adversely affected  and
     indeed the Appellant might be unable to adduce sufficient  evidence  of
     maintenance and accommodation in order to satisfy the  requirements  of
     the Immigration Rules. His wife's income alone was  insufficient.   All
     this constituted an insurmountable obstacle to the  Appellant's  return
     from Nigeria. This was pointed out to the Adjudicator  and  he  was  in
     error in not accepting it.

  7. Mr Deller argued that the appeal should fail for three reasons.  First,
     on the evidence, there was  no  reason  why  the  Appellant  could  not
     satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The judgment as  to
     maintenance would not be made on the wife's income only,  but  also  on
     the Appellant's earning potential, which in the light  of  his  present
     employment, was more than adequate for the requirements of  the  Rules.
     Indeed there was no evidence that the Appellant's present job would not
     be held open for him whilst he made his application.   Second,  as  the
     Tribunal had recently held in several determinations, the  question  of
     whether an application for entry would succeed is a  decision  for  the
     Entry Clearance Officer, who would also have to apply the human  rights
     legislation, and Adjudicators and the Tribunal should not prejudge this
     decision. Third, the Court of Appeal has  held  that  a  spouse  should
     return to his own country to make a proper application, even if it  was
     likely to be refused.

  8. We have carefully considered these submissions and  the  relevant  law.
     The Adjudicator, when assessing Article 8, correctly  directed  himself
     to the Court of Appeal in  Amjad  Mahmood  [2001]  INLR  1.  The  Court
     undertook a very thorough review of the Strasbourg jurisprudence on the
     issue of proportionality and Lord Philips  MR  summarised  the  general
     position as follows.
           "I have drawn the following conclusions as to  the  approach  of
           the Commission and the ECHR to the  potential  conflict  between
           the respect for family life and the enforcement  of  immigration
           controls.
           1. A state has a right under international law  to  control  the
              entry of non-nationals into its territory, subject always  to
              its treaty obligations.
           2. Article 8 does not impose on a state any  general  obligation
              to respect the choice of residence of a married couple.
           3. Removal or exclusion of one family member from a state  where
              other members of the family are lawfully  resident  will  not
              necessarily infringe Article 8 rights provided there  are  no
              insurmountable obstacles to the family living together in the
              country of origin of the family members excluded, even  where
              this involves a degree of hardship for some or all members of
              the family.
           4. Article 8 is likely to be violated  by  the  expulsion  of  a
              member of the family that has  been  long  established  in  a
              state if the circumstances are such that it is not reasonable
              to expect the other members of  the  family  to  follow  that
              member expelled.
           5. Knowledge on the part of  one  spouse  at  the  time  of  the
              marriage  that  rights  of  residence  of  the   other   were
              precarious  militates  against  a  finding  that   an   order
              excluding the latter spouse violates Article 8.
           6. Whether interference with family rights is justified  in  the
              interests of controlling immigration will depend on  (i)  the
              facts of the  particular  case  and  (ii)  the  circumstances
              prevailing in the state whose action is impugned.

  9. Laws LJ added an important corollary to this in paragraph 26. He said
           "No matter that the immigrant in  the  individual  case,  having
           arrived here without the required entry clearance, may  be  able
           to show that he would have been entitled to one,  or  even  that
           the Home Office actually accepts that he meets the [Immigration]
           Rules' substantive requirements; it is  simply  unfair  that  he
           should not have to wait in the queue  like  everyone  else.   At
           least it is unfair unless he can  demonstrate  some  exceptional
           circumstances which reasonably justifies his jumping the queue."

 10. The Court of Appeal in Isiko [2001] Imm AR 291 also concluded that  the
     Respondent was entitled to regard as important  the  integrity  of  the
     immigration regime  as  a  whole,  and  expressly  approved  the  above
     observations by Laws LJ. The Court of Appeal in Razgar [2003] EWCA  Civ
     840 further underlined the importance of  the  margin  of  appreciation
     that should be given to the Respondent's policy  as  expressed  in  the
     Immigration Rules.
           "When it comes to deciding how much weight to give to the policy
           of maintaining an effective immigration policy, the  Adjudicator
           should pay very careful deference to the view of  the  Secretary
           of State as to the importance of maintaining such a policy."


 11. In Ekinci [2003] EWCA Civ 765,  the  Court  of  Appeal  considered  and
     rejected the proposition that if an applicant were unlikely to be  able
     to satisfy the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules,  it  would  in
     itself  be  disproportionate  to  return  him  in  order  to  make   an
     application in accordance with the Rules. Simon Brown LJ held:
           "It would be a bizarre and unsatisfactory result  if,  the  less
           able the Applicant is to satisfy the full requirements for entry
           clearance, the more readily he should be  excused  the  need  to
           apply...... True it is that "the protection of human  rights  is
           not a reward for virtue and the with holding or dilution of them
           is not a penalty for vice," but  that  is  not  to  say  that  a
           person's immigration history is any relevant consideration  when
           striking  the  balance  between  his  Article   8   rights   and
           countervailing  public   interest   in   maintaining   effective
           immigration control."

 12. The Tribunal has also considered, in this context, the  extent  of  the
     Adjudicator and Tribunal's task. In [2003] UKIAT  00078  G  Algeria  it
     held
           "We should not prejudge the Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision
           or assume that he  would  breach  Article  8  when  making  that
           decision.  The issue before  us,  as  for  the  Adjudicator,  is
           whether it would be disproportionate to require the Appellant to
           return to Algeria to make a visa application for entry to the UK
           as a spouse in accordance with the Immigration Rules."

 13. We have applied these principles to the present appeal.  The  Appellant
     came to the UK by deception and delayed a year before even  making  his
     asylum application, which was then dismissed for lack  of  credibility.
     At no point during his stay would he have been entitled to  asylum  and
     thus the policy of the  Respondent,  to  discourage  illegal  entry  by
     deception and queue jumping, is properly engaged. His  wife  must  have
     been aware of his precarious immigration status when they  began  their
     relationship, and they married after his  application  for  asylum  had
     been refused by the Respondent. Having  said  that  the  Appellant  has
     lived here now for many years and he has a family and a home and a good
     job in the UK. His wife works part-time. There is no evidence that  his
     present employers would not be willing to re-employ him on his  return.
     Be that as it may, given his actual earnings and his potential earnings
     in the future in the UK, there is no  reason  why  an  application  for
     entry by him from Nigeria should be turned down.  There is no  evidence
     either that the process will be unduly protracted. Thus on the facts an
     application is likely  to  succeed,  but  even  if  it  were  not,  the
     Adjudicator was entitled to conclude that it would be proportionate  to
     expect the Appellant, as a person who had entered the UK by  deception,
     to have to return home and make a proper  application  for  entry  from
     there,  notwithstanding  the  other  countervailing  factors   in   the
     balancing exercise. In  suggesting  that  the  requirements  for  entry
     clearance present an insuperable obstacle to the Appellant returning to
     the UK legally, Mr Joseph misunderstood both the facts, and indeed  the
     reference in Mahmood to "insuperable obstacles," which properly relates
     to the different issue of whether the Appellant's family  could  return
     to his home country with him.

 14. For the  reasons  stated  above  we  conclude  that  the  Adjudicator's
     decision  was  properly  open  to  him  and   is   fully   sustainable.
     Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.
