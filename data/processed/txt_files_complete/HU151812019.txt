For the Appellant:     Ms S. Rogers, Justice First
For the Respondent:    Mr C. Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born on the 9th April  1999.  He
    appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge Fisher) to dismiss his human rights appeal.


 2. Judge Fisher's decision was promulgated on the 28th November 2019.  The
    Appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the
    6th April 2020 by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Shaerf.    The  file  was
    reviewed on the 18th June 2019 by  the  Vice  President  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal Mr CMG Ockelton who determined that since the Appellant was at
    that stage unrepresented,   this  was  not  a  matter  that  should  be
    considered on the papers under Rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008. Judge Ockelton further directed that in light  of
    the Covid-19 emergency it would not be practicable to convene a face-to-
    face hearing of this appeal. He instead decided that the hearing should
    take place remotely via 'Skype'.  Both parties consented to the  matter
    proceeding via this medium.  As it happens the Appellant had managed to
    secure legal assistance by the time of the hearing.  Before me Ms Sarah
    Rogers, an OISC registered representative  with  the  charity  'Justice
    First' made submissions on his behalf. The hearing was also  'attended'
    by the Appellant, his father and for the Secretary of State, Mr Bates.




    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The Appellant, it is accepted, has lived in the  United  Kingdom  since
    the 3rd September 2010 when he entered the country on a visit visa.  He
    was then aged 11 years old and  was  in  the  company  of  his  mother,
    brother and sister. The Appellant's mother remained in the country  and
    subsequently made various attempts to regularise the family's position,
    including claiming asylum and making an application for leave to remain
    on human rights grounds.  The  last  of  these  applications,  made  in
    September 2017, resulted in the Appellant's mother, father and siblings
    all being granted three years' Discretionary Leave  in  February  2018.
    They are all now on the '10 year route  to  settlement'.  Although  the
    Appellant had been included in the applications, he was  excluded  from
    the grant because he had turned 18. The present appeal arises from  his
    further submissions made on  human  rights  grounds,  received  by  the
    Respondent on the 15th July 2019 and treated as a 'fresh' human  rights
    claim.


 4. The  Respondent refused to grant the Appellant leave  on  human  rights
    grounds because he cannot meet any of the alternative  requirements  of
    Appendix FM or  paragraph 276ADE(1), and because the Secretary of State
    did not consider that his case disclosed any exceptional  circumstances
    that would render the refusal disproportionate and so incompatible with
    the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8 ECHR.


 5. Before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant accepted the  Respondent's
    conclusions in respect  of  the  Rules  to  be  correct.  He  contended
    nonetheless that the refusal to grant him  leave  in  line  with  other
    family members  would  be  a  disproportionate  interference  with  his
    Article 8 rights.  The Appellant contended that he  has  a  significant
    family and private life  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  that  no  such
    corresponding relationships exist in Nigeria. In particular  he  relied
    on the following matters:


              i) The Appellant continues to live with  his  mother,  father,
                 brother and two sisters. His parents  are  both  keyworkers
                 (his father is a support worker who  at  the  date  of  the
                 appeal was undertaking training to be a social worker;  his
                 mother  is  a  care  worker).  Both  work  full  time:  the
                 Appellant therefore takes on responsibility in  the  family
                 of looking after his  younger  siblings,  including  taking
                 them to and from school/  sports  training  and  doing  the
                 housework.


             ii) All of these close family members have  held  Discretionary
                 Leave since  February  2018.  Although  the  Appellant  was
                 included in the applications giving rise to those grants he
                 was refused leave because he had turned 18 and  so  was  no
                 longer classed as  his  mother's  dependant.  He  continues
                 however to be part of  the  family  unit,  there  being  no
                 'bright  line'  between  minority  and  majority:   Ghising
                 (family life-adults-Gurkha policy applied) [2012] UKUT  160
                 and Singh v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
                 [2015] EWCA Civ 630 applied.  All of the family  aver  that
                 it would be extremely distressing to be separated from  the
                 Appellant now.

            iii) The Appellant is particularly close to his younger siblings
                 and it would be contrary to their best interests if he were
                 not to be permitted to remain in this country: s.55 of  the
                 Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 applied.

             iv) He has spent the  formative  years  of  his  life  in  this
                 country and has a great many close friendships.

              v) The Appellant is highly integrated into the community, such
                 integration being evidenced by his involvement  in  various
                 charities and community organisations, and his grant  of  a
                 scholarship to study Physiotherapy  at  the  University  of
                 Teeside (a course which he was compelled to abandon due  to
                 his lack of status).  It remains his aspiration to  qualify
                 and to work in the NHS.  A British citizen  friend  of  the
                 family, Mrs Irene Roderick, attended the appeal hearing and
                 gave evidence to  the  effect  that  she  and  her  husband
                 regarded the Appellant as  among  the  "brightest  and  the
                 best" migrants that  current  government  policy  aimed  at
                 encouraging to come to this country.

             vi) The Appellant left Nigeria when he was a child. He  has  no
                 substantive relationships  there  today,  having  lost  all
                 contact with friends, and  remaining  distant  from  family
                 members still resident in the country.


 6. Judge Fisher was clearly impressed by the Appellant. She  commends  him
    for his conduct in the preparation of his own appeal describes him as a
    credit to his family. She accepts the evidence before her that he is  a
    hard-working, intelligent and popular young man who contributes to  his
    community by his active support for sports  clubs,  his  church  and  a
    charity supporting refugees in  the  North  East.   Having  made  those
    introductory comments the Judge proceeds to determine the appeal.


 7. She first finds that the Appellant cannot meet any of the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules. As I note above this was  not  challenged  by
    the Appellant himself, whose case fell between the various  stools  set
    out by 276ADE (1).   He could  not  avail  himself  of  276ADE  (1)(iv)
    because he was no longer a child. He had not lived here for 20 years or
    more: 276ADE(1)(iii).  He will not meet the terms of 276ADE(1)(v) until
    the 28th November 2022 because he had not yet spent more than  half  of
    his life in this country. At this stage the only possible route open to
    him under the 'private life' provision was 276ADE(1)(vi) which required
    him to demonstrate that there are very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration in Nigeria. This, Judge Fisher deemed, he could not do.  He
    is a personable and intelligent young man who has already  illustrated,
    since his arrival in this country,  his  aptitude  for  hard  work  and
    ability to adapt to a new challenge.  He would  be  able  to  make  new
    friends, and although he would have a  very  limited  understanding  of
    life in Nigeria he did already have some experience  of  work  (through
    his voluntary roles) and his parents  would  be  able  to  advise  him,
    albeit from afar.   He could continue his education  there,  should  he
    wish to do so. He is a young man in good health and having taken all of
    these matters into account, Judge Fisher concluded that the  disruption
    and difficulties that he would inevitably face were not  sufficient  to
    surmount the high hurdle in the rule.

 8. Judge Fisher goes on to consider Article 8 'outside of the rules'.  She
    accepts, as did the Respondent, that Article 8 is engaged in this case,
    with the refusal to grant leave amounting to an interference  with  the
    Appellant's family and private lives in the United Kingdom. In  respect
    of proportionality Judge Fisher considered those matters reflecting the
    public interest set out at s117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 and having done so found the Respondent's  decision  to
    be both lawful and proportionate. The appeal was thereby dismissed.

 9. The Appellant drafted the grounds of appeal himself. They  are  by  any
    standards, but particularly for a 21  year-old,  cogent  and  extremely
    clear.     He   takes   issue   with   Judge   Fisher's   approach   to
    proportionality, failure to have regard to established  principles  and
    caselaw (Singh, Ghising supra) and asserts irrationality and inadequate
    reasoning, particularly with regard to the impact of his removal on his
    siblings. For reasons that will  become  clear  I  have  not  found  it
    necessary to deal with each of the points  raised  in  the  Appellant's
    grounds.  I note that in granting  permission  Judge  Shaerf  said  the
    following:

         "The judgment in GM (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
         Department [2019] EWCA Civ 1630 was handed down on the 4th  October
         2019, some 6 weeks before the hearing before the Judge.  Paragraphs
         48-49 and 52-54 of GM (Sri Lanka) are relevant. The Court of Appeal
         found that in relation to the position under Article 8 outside  the
         Immigration Rules the extent to which obstacles to  return  can  be
         overcome is  a  "relevant  factor"  in  relation  to  "non-settled"
         applicants but that it is not the test.  In this  light  the  Judge
         made an arguable error of law in her proportionality assessment and
         permission to appeal on all grounds is granted".




    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings


10. Having had regard to the determination as a whole,  it  appears  to  me
    that the passage which gave Judge Shaerf cause for concern is this one,
    at FTT �29. Having directed itself to the  terms  of  s117B(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, by which it was  mandated
    to recognise that the maintenance of  immigration  control  is  in  the
    public interest, the Tribunal said this:


         "If the Appellant were able to remain in the United Kingdom despite
         the fact that he is unable to meet the rules, it would rapidly lead
         to a perception amongst the public that the system  of  immigration
         control is unduly porous. Furthermore it would be unfair  on  other
         applicants who  have  failed  in  their  applications  for  similar
         reasons"


11. From there the Tribunal goes on to consider the remaining provisions of
    s117B - all of  which  are  either  neutral  or  weighing  against  the
    Appellant - before concluding at �32 that the weight to be attached  to
    the maintenance of immigration control exceeds that to be  attached  to
    the Appellant's Article 8(1) rights.


12. Before me Mr Bates accepted that in so doing, the Tribunal erred in two
    critical respects.

13. First, there was no basis in law for the Tribunal's  self-direction  at
    its �31 that s117B(4) required it to give "little weight  to  a  family
    life"  established  when  the  Appellant  was  in  the  United  Kingdom
    unlawfully. The provision which the Tribunal no doubt had in  mind  was
    s117B(4)(b) which relates solely to family life with a partner.  It  is
    of course the case that the Appellant established his family life  with
    his parents and siblings long before they ever arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom. As such the weight to be attached to those relationships could
    not logically be diminished by the fact that they were all living  here
    without status.

14. Second, Mr Bates accepted that there would appear to be  no  evidential
    or legal foundation for the Tribunal's self-direction at its  �29  (set
    out at my �10 above).  The Judge was simply not in a  position  to  say
    that  allowing  this  particular  appeal  would  "rapidly  lead  to   a
    perception amongst the public that the system of immigration control is
    unduly porous".   As to Judge Shaerf's observations  in  his  grant  of
    permission, the statutory scheme approved  by  parliament  specifically
    provides for the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8  ECHR  to
    be determined  by  Judges  with  reference  to  circumstances  existing
    'outside of the rules': MM (Lebanon) v. Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2017] UKSC 10.  Implicit in that is that some  appeals  can
    legitimately be allowed  albeit  that  the  appellant  could  not,  for
    whatever reason, meet the  requirements  of  the  rules.  As  Mr  Bates
    accepted, section 117B(1) serves to  remind  decision-makers  that  the
    maintenance of immigration control is in the public interest;  it  does
    not require all appeals 'outside of the rules' to be  dismissed.     As
    to whether it would be "unfair" for similarly placed applicants if this
    appeal were to be allowed, that would of course only  be  the  case  if
    this appeal was allowed despite being unmeritorious.


15.  It is to the merits of the case that I now turn, because they form the
    background to a third error in the Tribunal's approach.

16. I am conscious that decisions of the First-tier Tribunal are not to  be
    'cherry picked'; they are to be read as a composite whole.  It  is  for
    that reason that I have looked past the fact that in the  part  of  the
    decision where the proportionality balancing exercise is conducted  [��
    29-32] there is no mention at all of any factors that  might  count  in
    the Appellant's favour.  Giving the determination its widest  and  most
    inclusive reading, it must be acknowledged  that  prior  to  addressing
    proportionality 'outside of the rules' the Judge had already recognised
    the Appellant's contributions to life in the United Kingdom  [at  �17],
    that he is an extremely pleasant and sociable young man  [at  �20]  who
    has excelled academically and shown strong evidence of his intelligence
    and industry [�22],  that the 8 years and 10 months he had spent in the
    United Kingdom at that point had been formative ones [�21] and that "it
    could be said" that it would be contrary to the best interests  of  his
    siblings were he be compelled to return to Nigeria [�28].

17. It remains the case that in all of that  discussion  -  and  favourable
    assessment of the Appellant - the Tribunal does not appear  to  address
    the central plank of the Appellant's  case:  that  the  effect  of  the
    Respondent's decision is to leave him a "stranded sibling" , being  the
    only one of four children in this close-knit family to be excluded from
    life together in the United Kingdom.   The nearest  that  the  Tribunal
    comes to considering the impact of  the  decision  on  the  individuals
    concerned is at �22 when it concludes, in the context of  the  test  at
    276ADE(1)(vi),  that  the  family's  distress  was   not   capable   of
    constituting a "very significant obstacle" to reintegration in Nigeria.
    That conclusion is - as a matter of logic and law -  quite  right,  but
    the test  under  276ADE(1)(vi)  was  not  determinative  of  the  wider
    proportionality assessment that the Tribunal was required to undertake.
        It was for instance incumbent upon  the  Tribunal  to  explore  the
    impact of family separation not just on the Appellant, but on his other
    family  members:  Beoku-Betts  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
    Department  [2008]  UKHL  38.    As  it  is,  those   complex   factual
    evaluations are here reduced to the self-direction at �26  that  family
    life can continue after majority is reached, applying Ghising.

18. For those reasons I am satisfied that the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal contains errors of law and it must be set aside.




    The Decision 'Re-Made'

19. Before me Mr Bates and Ms Rogers were in agreement that the decision in
    the appeal could be remade by  me  taking  into  account  the  evidence
    already given, and the submissions made at the hearing, for which I  am
    grateful.  I agreed to do so with the proviso that if I had any further
    questions about the evidence or law I would revert to  the  parties.  I
    have not considered it necessary to do so.


20. For the reasons set out at �7 above, the Appellant does not meet any of
    the alternative requirements of the Immigration Rules relating  to  the
    United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8.

21. I proceed to consider the Appellant's case 'outside of the rules'.

22. I accept, as the Respondent did before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that
    the Appellant enjoys a family life with his parents and siblings in the
    United Kingdom. I acknowledge that the Appellant is now 21  years  old,
    but I am satisfied that family life persists for the following reasons.

23. The Appellant has always been part of this family unit. He was born  in
    1999. The siblings which followed were born respectively in 2002,  2005
    and 2011.  He has always lived  with  his  parents,  and  there  is  no
    indication that this will not  remain  the  case  for  the  foreseeable
    future: I note that the Appellant's plans  to  attend  university  were
    based on him remaining at home and attending a local institution.   The
    unchallenged evidence is that he has a strong emotional bond  not  only
    with his mum and dad, but with his brother and sisters, whom as a young
    adult he  now  helps  to  care  for.   He  remains  financially  wholly
    dependent upon his parents.

24. Article 8 should not be read as protecting any relationships  within  a
    family. While there is a presumption  that  'family  life'  will  exist
    between a parent and minor children, once those children  have  reached
    majority the law requires greater scrutiny of the claimed  ties  before
    the obligation  will  be  engaged.   In  cases  including  Kugathas  v.
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  31  and
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v. Onuorah [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    1757 the higher  courts  have  emphasised  that  there  must  be  real,
    committed and effective support between the parties, which can include,
    but  should  not  be  limited   to,   financial   dependency.     Those
    requirements should not, however, be interpreted to introduce an unduly
    high or restrictive test: Ghising v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAT). Whether a family life exists  will
    always be a question  of  fact:  PT  (Sri  Lanka)  v.  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, Chennai [2016] EWCA Civ 612.   In a series of cases concerning
    applications for entry  clearance  by  the  adult  children  of  Gurkha
    veterans the courts have  repeatedly  stressed  that  one  question  of
    particular significance is whether the adult child has  established  an
    independent life of his own. In Singh v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630 Sir Stanley Burnton said this [at �24]:


         "I do not think that the judgments to which I have referred lead to
         any difficulty in determining the correct approach to Article 8  in
         cases involving adult children. In  the  case  of  adults,  in  the
         context of immigration  control,  there  is  no  legal  or  factual
         presumption as to the existence or absence of family life  for  the
         purposes of Article 8.  I  point  out  that  the  approach  of  the
         European   Commission   for   Human   Rights   cited    approvingly
         in Kugathas did not include any requirement of exceptionality. It
         all depends on the facts. The love and affection between  an  adult
         and his parents or siblings will not of itself justify a finding of
         a family life. There has to be something more. A young adult living
         with his parents or siblings will normally have a family life to be
         respected under Article 8. A child enjoying a family life with  his
         parents does not suddenly cease to have a family life  at  midnight
         as he turns 18 years of age. On  the  other  hand,  a  young  adult
         living independently of his parents may well not have a family life
         for the purposes of Article 8."


25. Applying those principles to the facts I am wholly satisfied that there
    is here a family life  between  the  Appellant,  his  parents  and  his
    siblings.

26. The effect of the Respondent's decision is to require the Appellant  to
    return  to  Nigeria.  As  the  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted,  it   is
    overwhelmingly likely that he will do so alone, since his  parents  and
    siblings are now on a path to  settlement  here:  they  have  all  been
    granted  leave  to  remain  on  the  grounds  that  it  would  not   be
    'reasonable'  to  expect  the   Appellant's   younger   siblings,   all
    'qualifying' children under s117D Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002, to leave the United Kingdom.    I  am  accordingly  satisfied
    that the decision  represents  an  interference  with  the  Appellant's
    family life and that Article 8 is engaged.

27. There is no dispute that the Respondent is lawfully empowered  to  make
    the decision that she has.

28. The only question remaining is  whether  the  decision  to  refuse  the
    Appellant leave in line with his family is disproportionate.

29. By s117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  I  am
    required to consider the  following  matters  relating  to  the  public
    interest.

30. The first is that the maintenance of effective immigration controls  is
    in the public interest.    I place due weight  on  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant does not meet the requirements of the rules, and that he  has
    not, since the expiry of his visit visa  in  2010,  had  permission  to
    remain in this country.

31. It is further  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
    interests of the  economic  well-being  of  the  United  Kingdom,  that
    persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able  to
    speak English, because persons who can speak  English  are  less  of  a
    burden on taxpayers, and are better able  to  integrate  into  society:
    s117B(2).  I am satisfied that the  Appellant  speaks  fluent  English.
    Although this is a matter that does not therefore weigh against him  in
    the balancing exercise, it is not  a  matter  which  attracts  positive
    weight on his side of the scales.

32. Section 117B(3) mandates that it is in  the  public  interest,  and  in
    particular in the interests of the economic well-being  of  the  United
    Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
    are financially independent, because such persons are not a  burden  on
    taxpayers, and are better able to integrate into society.  There is  no
    evidence before me that either the  Appellant  or  his  family  are  in
    receipt of public funds to which they are not entitled.  The  Appellant
    is supported by his parents, both of whom work full time.  Again,  this
    is a factor which attracts only neutral weight.

33. Insofar as it is relevant to the Appellant s117B(4) states that  little
    weight should be given to a private life  that  has  established  by  a
    person at a time when the person is in the United  Kingdom  unlawfully.
    In the approaching ten years that  the  Appellant  has  lived  in  this
    country virtually all of it has been as an overstayer. As  such  little
    weight can be attached to his private life. I am  nevertheless  mindful
    that in my holistic balancing exercise I must have regard to  the  fact
    that for the first seven of those years the Appellant was a child,  who
    can hardly be held responsible for the fact that his parents decided to
    remain  here  without  leave:  Miah   (section   117B   NIAA   2002   -
    children) [2016] UKUT 00131 (IAC).  In that regard I  find  that  some
    weight can be attached to the  relationships,  values  and  educational
    achievements that the Appellant developed during that period.

34. Having had regard to those factors I record that the public interest in
    refusing the Appellant leave is as set out above.  The  primary  matter
    weighing against him is that he does not meet the requirements  of  the
    rules, which are currently  the  expression  of  where  the  government
    believes that the balance should  be  struck  in  accordance  with  our
    Article 8 obligations.    There  are  no  'suitability'  issues  to  be
    weighed against the Appellant.

35. I remind myself that where an applicant fails to meet the  requirements
    of the rules it will only exceptionally be the case that  the  decision
    to refuse will be  disproportionate:   MM  (Lebanon)  supra.   That  is
    because of the significant weight that is to be attached to the  public
    interest in the rules being followed and maintained.  Weighing  against
    that public interest, in the  Appellant's  favour,  are  the  following
    matters.

36. He has spent his formative years in the United Kingdom, from the age of
    11 to 21, and I accept that these are  likely  to  be  years  of  great
    significance in his life: Azimi-Moayed v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2013] UKUT 197.  These are  the  years  in  which  the
    Appellant has developed as a person, formed his  cultural  attachments,
    values and social norms. I accept that having attended school  in  this
    country he has made good and lasting friendships, ones that will not be
    easily be replaced.  He may, as found by the  First-tier  Tribunal,  be
    well equipped to form a new private life in Nigeria should he  have  to
    return there, but I recognise that this would be at the expense of  the
    private life that he already has here, developed over a decade.   There
    may not be very significant obstacles to him rebuilding in Nigeria, but
    I accept that his fear of feeling lonely and stressed on  return  there
    is probably well founded, and that this would result as much  from  the
    loss he would suffer in leaving his home here as much as the  shock  of
    the new.

37. The crux of the case is however this. The Appellant is an integral part
    of a family unit which has otherwise been permitted to remain here, and
    to remain together, by operation of the very rules  which  now  exclude
    him.   His younger siblings were found to qualify for limited leave  to
    remain under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv): as  children  who  had  spent  in
    excess of seven years here they were judged to have put down  roots  to
    the extent that the  Secretary  of  State  accepted  it  would  now  be
    unreasonable to expect them to leave. The Appellant's parents were then
    able to demonstrate, with reference to  s117B(6)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, that it was not in the public interest
    for them to be refused leave.  Only the  Appellant  -  the  'aged  out'
    child - found no refuge in the statutory scheme.

38. As Sales J points out in R (on the application of  Nagre)  [2013]  EWHC
    720 (Admin) it is not possible for the rules to cover  each  and  every
    class that might be deserving of some succour under the Article:

         "27. There is in my judgment, nothing untoward in the fact that the
         new rules do not necessarily track absolutely precisely and provide
         in detail in advance for every nuance in the application of Article
         8 in individual cases. I do not think it would be feasible, or even
         possible, to produce simple Immigration Rules capable of providing
         clear guidance to all the officials who have to operate them that
         did that...."

39. But that being so, decision-makers must be mindful of why and  to  what
    extent  claimants  failed  under  the  rules.  Here  there  were  three
    provisions which could potentially have applied to  the  Appellant.  He
    was a few months too old to take advantage of 276ADE(1)(iv). He has not
    yet reached the point in time when he will qualify under  276ADE(1)(v).
    That leaves the test of "very significant obstacles to integration"  at
    sub-section (vi). This exacting test requires claimants to demonstrate,
    in essence, that they would be unable to establish a new  private  life
    for themselves in the country to which they are  to  be  returned.  The
    rule leaves no room for consideration of the life that  the  individual
    leaves behind in the United Kingdom.  That this is the  stringent  test
    applied to adults who, having arrived in this country, find  themselves
    with no right to remain is understandable:  that we set the bar high in
    such  circumstances  is  in  accordance  with  the  broader  scheme  of
    immigration control, the framework for which we find in Part 5A of  the
    2002 Act.  It is consistent with the expression of the public  interest
    at, for instance, ss117B(1) and  (4).    It  is  however  difficult  to
    imagine that when the drafters of the rule conceived of this test  that
    they had in mind adults such as this Appellant.   I cannot  think  that
    this should be the beginning and the end  of  the  enquiry  when  I  am
    considering the case of an individual who came here as a child and  has
    grown up here, whose entire family is now on a path to  settlement  and
    who remains an integral part of that family unit.   I am satisfied that
    in a case such as his, the proper focus of my Article 8 enquiry  should
    be the Article 8 rights that he enjoys here, rather than the life  that
    he might lead should he be compelled to return to Nigeria.


40. The life that the Appellant leads here is a  rich  and  rewarding  one.
    Since his arrival here he has, as  the  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted,
    worked hard and excelled academically. In September 2018 the University
    of Teeside offered one of only five scholarships to  the  Appellant  to
    study for a BSc in Physiotherapy. Unfortunately his lack of status  has
    meant that he was unable to continue with that course, but  it  remains
    his ambition to qualify as a physio and work in the NHS.

41. In doing so he will be following in the footsteps of his parents,  both
    of whom are healthcare keyworkers who have continued to work full  time
    throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the long hours that  his  parents
    work the Appellant contributes to the household by  looking  after  his
    younger siblings. He does housework and  plays  a  particular  role  in
    taking his younger brother to and from his training  at  Middlesborough
    FC's Academy where he has a youth contract.  Whilst I accept Mr  Bates'
    submission that the Appellant's contribution is probably not  necessary
    for the day to day functioning of this family - his eldest sister  also
    plays her part and his parents could no doubt employ childcare - it  is
    an important indication of where the Appellant is in his  life.  He  is
    not currently at, and appears nowhere near, the point  where  he  would
    start to lead an independent life away from  his  parents.  He  remains
    entirely financially reliant upon them, and I accept his evidence  that
    this extends, for the moment at least, to an emotional dependency,  all
    the more urgent because of the difficult and uncertain position that he
    has found himself in.  His parents and siblings in turn look to him  to
    help out in the house and "be there" for them.  Although the  Appellant
    has good friends in the United Kingdom, at this stage in his  life  the
    balance in his composite Article 8 life  tips  positively  towards  his
    family.

42. That this is so is confirmed not only by  his  evidence,  but  by  that
    given by his other family  members.  His  father  told  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that life without his eldest son was unimaginable. His  sister
    [E] - only 8 years old at the date that she wrote  her  letter  to  the
    Tribunal in July 2019 - writes that she wants to burst into  tears  and
    run from the room when the possibility of her  brother's  departure  is
    discussed. She says (in a disclosure that gives some indication of  the
    kind of family that this is) that he takes  her  to  and  from  school,
    gymnastics, Brownies, athletics, dancing, tennis and  netball.   Eldest
    sister [A], in a long handwritten letter explains that she and he  have
    always had a particularly strong bond, and that she always looks to him
    for guidance and support when  their  parents  are  not  at  home.  She
    explains that outside of the home he has "flourished", making  a  great
    many strong friendships, and excelling at school to the extent that  he
    was elected Vice President of his 6th form college. Within the home she
    describes him as a "role model" for her and her younger siblings: he is
    there not just to look after them and the house but is willing to  help
    out  with  whatever  issues  they  might  have.  [A]  speaks   of   her
    "heartbreak" at seeing the stress that her brother has been place under
    by the negative Home Office decision and his resulting  departure  from
    Teeside University.  She sums up the  consequences  of  his  separation
    from the family as "absolute devastation".

43. Having taken all of those matters into account, I am satisfied that  in
    the  particular  circumstances  of  this  case,  the  United  Kingdom's
    obligations under Article 8 of  the  ECHR  can  only  be  satisfied  by
    granting the Appellant leave to remain on  human  rights  grounds.  The
    impact of the Respondent's decision is for  this  family  unjustifiably
    harsh: as the Appellant's mother puts it, they came here  as  a  family
    and have stuck together through thick and thin.  I  accept  that  their
    separation now would be extremely difficult for the adults and children
    alike. The Appellant himself would find himself dislocated from all  he
    knows and in a strange and distant country. His parents would no  doubt
    be consumed by guilt and worry. His younger siblings would in  turn  be
    impacted by those emotions, and, contrary to their best interests, miss
    the presence - both physical and emotional  -  of  their  "role  model"
    elder brother. In all the circumstances I am satisfied that this  would
    be disproportionate, an outcome inconsistent with the aims  of  Article
    8. The appeal is therefore allowed.

44. I have not been asked to make an order for anonymity, and on the  facts
    I see no reason to do so.
