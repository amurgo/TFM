 1. In Nagre v SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  the  Administrative  Court
    approved the guidance of the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu  [2013]  UKUT  45
    (IAC) in turn endorsing the two stage approach recommended by the Upper
    Tribunal in MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC).
     Sales J added the proviso that it would not  always  be  necessary  to
    move on to the second stage  and  consider  Article  8  proportionality
    apart from the provisions of the Immigration Rules. Where the rules and
    the learning on Article 8 were in harmony the answer given by the rules
    might render further inquiry unnecessary, unless there were exceptional
    circumstances.  In that case the difference between the rules  and  the
    Strasbourg principles was marginal.

 2. It follows from  that case, and the decisions of  the  UT  in  Ogundimu
    (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT  00060  (IAC)  that  judges
    hearing appeals  against  decisions  made  after  9  July  2012  should
    consider how the Immigration Rules would apply, and make  any  relevant
    findings in that context before considering the  wider  application  of
    Article 8 and the jurisprudence of the Upper Tribunal, and  the  higher
    courts, either to decide whether  there  are  exceptional  factors  not
    contemplated by the Rules or that the decision is an unlawful  one  and
    disproportionate to the legitimate aim.  Pending any  further  guidance
    from the Court of Appeal, judges of  both  chambers  should  apply  the
    principles set out in Izuazu.

 3. Paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules makes no  reference  to  persons
    who commit crimes as juveniles.  By contrast the decision of the  Grand
    Chamber in Maslov v  Austria  [2008]  ECHR  546  is  clear  that  "when
    assessing the nature and seriousness of the offences  committed  by  an
    applicant, it has to be taken into account whether he or she  committed
    them as a juvenile or as an adult".

 4. As the Upper Tribunal has explained in Izuazu and Ogundimu,  where  the
    Immigration Rules do not reflect the established principles under human
    rights law it is the law as laid down in primary legislation that  must
    be followed.

 5. Adding to what  the  Tribunal  said  in  Masih  (deportation  -  public
    interest - basic principles) Paksitan [2012] UKUT  00046  (IAC),  where
    the course of conduct relied on in the  deportation  decision  includes
    conduct that has not resulted in a criminal charge or  conviction,  the
    Tribunal will need to  take  that  conduct  into  account  despite  the
    absence of sentencing remarks (see Bah  (EO  (Turkey)  -  liability  to
    deport) [2012] UKUT 00196 (IAC)).


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against a decision of  a  panel
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Britton and Dr T  Okitipi)  dated  17
    October 2012. In that  decision  the  panel  allowed  the  respondent's
    appeal against a decision on 22 August 2012 to make a deportation order
    against him.  We  shall  refer  to  the  respondent  as  the  claimant,
    although he was the appellant in the proceedings below.


 2. The claimant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 20 June 1994.  He  arrived
    in the United Kingdom as a visitor on 11 August  2001  when  he  was  7
    years old and he was eventually granted indefinite leave to remain on 5
    March 2007 as the dependent of his maternal grandmother  who  had  been
    granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom in September  2003.   The
    claimant's application for an extension of stay was refused on  the  17
    October 2003 and was allowed following an  appeal  to  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal decided in his favour on 8 January 2007.


 3. On the 26 January 2012, following his pleas of guilty, the claimant was
    sentenced by HHJ Hillen at the Blackfriars Crown Court to  a  detention
    and training order of two years duration for seven offences  consisting
    of four occasions between 2 April 2011 and 2  June  2011  when  he  was
    involved as a runner in supplying heroin and crack cocaine. The term of
    his detention order was subsequently reduced to 18 months.  He was aged
    16 when he committed these offences and 17� when he  was  sentenced  by
    the judge.


 4. This was not his first appearance before a criminal court. He had  been
    sentenced  on two occasions in 2008 for offences  of  possession  of  a
    bladed instrument and theft; one occasion in 2009 for possession  of  a
    bladed instrument; and three occasions in 2010  for  possession  of  an
    offensive weapon, theft, robbery, and attempted robbery and failing  to
    comply with the requirements of a detention  and  training  order.   He
    made one appearance in 2011 for failing to comply with the requirements
    of  a  youth  rehabilitation  order.   Only  one  of   these   previous
    appearances had resulted in a custodial sentence and  that  was  a  six
    month detention and training order in 2010.


 5. As a result of these convictions, on the 18 August 2012  the  Secretary
    of State decided to make a deportation order on conducive  grounds.  It
    was a significant factor in the Secretary of State's decision that  the
    claimant  was  a  persistent  offender  whose  offending  was  strongly
    influenced by his membership of a  criminal  gang  operating  in  North
    London. There was both before the judge at Blackfriars Crown Court  and
    the  panel  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,   intelligence   information
    supplementing the criminal record indicating  his  conduct  as  a  gang
    member.   The  Secretary  of  State's  case  was  that  the  claimant's
    offending was persistent and becoming more serious; that his membership
    of a gang both posed a danger to the community and made it more  likely
    that he would re- offend.


 6. The decision to deport was made after 9 July 2012  when  amendments  to
    the Immigration Rules had come  into  force.  The  Secretary  of  State
    contended that  those  amendments  properly  applied  the  criteria  of
    Article 8 to the different scenarios set out in those Rules and that it
    was only in exceptional circumstances  that  a  person  who  could  not
    comply with the criteria set by the  Immigration  Rules  could  succeed
    under Article 8. The decision letter contended that:


        i. The claimant was liable to deportation under paragraph  398  (c)
           of the Immigration Rules because he was a persistent offender;
       ii. The claimant fell  outside  the  protection  of  paragraph  399A
           because although he had lived in the United Kingdom for 10 �  of
           his 17 � years before his custodial sentence he could  not  meet
           the requirement to have "no ties (including social, cultural  or
           family) with the country  to  which  he  would  have  to  go  if
           required to leave the United Kingdom."
      iii. The reason why it was not accepted that he the claimant  had  no
           ties with Jamaica, was because he and his family came from there
           and would be familiar with the culture and his estranged  father
           lived there with whom  he  could  re-establish  a  relationship,
           despite very limited previous contact.


 7. The claimant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  and  contended  that
    deportation would be a disproportionate interference  with  the  family
    and private life he enjoyed in the United Kingdom; that he was  only  a
    foot soldier in the gang; had done well during his sentence and despite
    some adjudications for fighting had gold status and with  the  help  of
    prison staff had taken training courses to prepare himself  for  lawful
    employment; he intended to avoid gang life and criminality on release.


 8.  After  hearing  evidence  from  the  claimant,  his  grandmother   and
    girlfriend the panel allowed his appeal finding  that  deportation  was
    not proportionate.  In its conclusions the  panel  directed  itself  in
    accordance with the UT decision of Masih (deportation - public interest
    - basic principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00046 (IAC)  setting  out  and
    applying the guidance of the  Strasbourg  Court  in  Maslov  v  Austria
    [2008] ECHR 546. The panel had careful regard to the judge's sentencing
    remarks, the claimant's age at the time of offending, the  evidence  of
    his progress in  prison  including  his  gold  status  and  educational
    certificates.  It noted that he had no  readily  available  support  in
    Jamaica.  If he  returned  to  gang  membership  or  committed  further
    offences  he  would  be  deported,  but  on  the  current   information
    deportation would be disproportionate.


 The Secretary of State's appeal


 9. In her grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  the  appellant  asserts
    that the panel failed to consider "the  Article  8  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules" and in  so  doing  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    presumption  to  deport  and  failed  to  apply  the  correct  test  by
    considering  what  exceptional   circumstances   applied   to   prevent
    deportation.


10. The grounds further assert that although the panel  said  that  it  had
    taken  into  account  the  serious  nature  of  the   claimant's   gang
    involvement and his previous convictions their  conclusion  shows  that
    they cannot have done so. The findings do not reflect the evidence.


11. At the hearing before us Mr Hibbs,  representing  the  appellant,  made
    written and oral submissions. He contended that the panel did not  give
    due attention to the Immigration Rules or grapple with  the  claimant's
    gang membership or risk of re-offending. This was glossed over with the
    panel giving the claimant the benefit of the doubt rather  than  making
    an assessment  of  the  evidence  that  was  before  them.  He  further
    suggested that the panel failed to take  into  account  the  claimant's
    period of irregular stay and instead treated him as a settled  migrant.
    The claimant's gang membership does not, he submitted, form an integral
    part of the panel's deliberation.


12. For the claimant Mr McCarthy put forward a written  skeleton  argument.
    He said that the intelligence evidence of gang  membership  was  before
    the panel and referred to in the Trial Judge's sentencing remarks. This
    gang membership must be taken in context. The claimant is described  as
    'a foot soldier', he held a low position in the gang  and  he  was  the
    youngest of those convicted.


13. We were referred to paragraphs 53, 54 and 56 of the determination.  The
    intelligence report is referred to specifically at paragraph 26 - 28 as
    is the sentencing court's view of the seriousness of  the  offence.  Mr
    McCarthy agreed that the claimant was involved with a serious  criminal
    gang and had a significant criminal history and pointed  out  that  the
    panel  recognised  this  at  paragraph  51  of  the  determination.  In
    considering the public interest the panel make  frequent  reference  to
    the claimant's gang activities.


14. Mr McCarthy referred us to Maslov v Austria [2008] ECHR 546  and  Masih
    (deportation - public interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT
    00046 (IAC) and added that the claimant had made  progress  in  prison,
    had now  been  released  on  licence  and  stood  the  best  chance  of
    rehabilitation in this country.


15. We reserved our decision and in doing so said that if we found that the
    panel had erred and  the  decision  needed  to  be  re-made  everything
    currently known would need to be considered by the Upper Tribunal.



 DECISION


16. The appellant's grounds are essentially three complaints. Firstly, that
    the panel failed to consider the family and private life provisions  of
    the Immigration Rules. Secondly, that the  panel  failed  to  give  due
    weight to the claimant's gang membership and therefore that the panel's
    reasoning  was  inadequate.  Thirdly,  Mr  Hibbs  suggested  that   the
    claimant's irregular stay and lack of settled status  should  be  taken
    into account.


 Ground 1:


17. So  far  as  the  first  issue  is  concerned  it  is  clear  from  the
    determination that the panel were alive to the relevant  provisions  of
    the Immigration Rules. These are referred to at paragraphs 29,  31,  32
    and 33 of the determination. The Immigration Rules provisions come with
    the panel's summary of the Secretary  of  State's  case  and  the  ECHR
    provisions with their summary of the claimant's case.


18. However in their findings at paragraphs 51 to 56 the panel do not refer
    specifically to either the Immigration Rules or the ECHR; but the terms
    under which the appeal is allowed "it would  not  be  proportionate  to
    deport" make it clear that it is the ECHR provisions  that  formed  the
    basis of the panel's decision.  They were plainly aware of the relevant
    learning of the UK courts on Article 8 claims.


19. Mr Hibbs' written submissions rely on the recent decision of Sales J in
    Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) as authority for  the  proposition
    that the Immigration Rules together with consideration  of  exceptional
    circumstances outside the Rules  under  the  SSHD's  guidance  provides
    "full coverage of an individual's rights under Article 8".


20. In Nagre the Administrative Court (see  paragraph  [30])  approved  the
    guidance of the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013]
    UKUT 00045 (IAC), in turn endorsing the two stage approach  recommended
    by the Upper Tribunal in MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT
    00393 (IAC).  Sales J added the proviso that it  would  not  always  be
    necessary to move on  to  the  second  stage  and  consider  Article  8
    proportionality apart from the  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    where the rules and the learning on  Article  8  were  in  harmony  the
    answer given by the rules might  render  further  inquiry  unnecessary,
    unless  there  were  exceptional  circumstances.   In  that  case   the
    difference between the rules and the Strasbourg principles was marginal
    (see paragraph [43]). The facts and issues in Nagre  were  far  removed
    from the  issues  that  arise  in  this  appeal  and  further  detailed
    consideration of that decision is not necessary or appropriate.


21. It follows from  the cases referred to above, and the decision  of  the
    UT in Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060  (IAC)
    that a panel considering a decision  made  after  9  July  2012  should
    consider how the Immigration Rules would apply to the  case,  and  make
    any relevant findings in that context,  before  considering  the  wider
    application of Article 8 and the jurisprudence of the  Upper  Tribunal,
    and the higher courts, either to decide whether there  are  exceptional
    factors not contemplated by the  rules  or  that  the  decision  is  an
    unlawful one and disproportionate to the legitimate aim.   Pending  any
    further guidance from the Court of  Appeal,  judges  of  both  chambers
    should apply the principles set out in Izuazu.


22. Applying this approach, we accept that although  the  panel  were  well
    aware of the provisions of the Rules it  did  not  in  terms  give  its
    decision  reflecting the issues under the  Rules  namely  whether   the
    claimant had 'no ties' with Jamaica and if he had some  ties  what  the
    overall Article 8 consequence would be.


23. However, assuming that this failure amounted to an error of law in  the
    making of the determination, it is not an error that would require  the
    re-making of the decision unless we considered that it was  a  material
    failure and one that could effect the overall decision in the case. Any
    error by the panel could not have that result if:-


       iv. On their primary findings the claimant had no ties with Jamaica,
        v. The provisions of the Immigration Rules failed  to  reflect  the
           criteria of the case law as to Article 8,
       vi. In any event there were relevant factors not  reflected  in  the
           Rules that amounted to exceptional circumstances.


24. We are satisfied that any error would not be material on this point for
    all three reasons.


25. As to the first, the panel found (at paragraph 54)  that  the  claimant
    has no readily available support in Jamaica. That  finding  has  to  be
    seen in the context of the conclusions of the earlier panel in  January
    2007 who was satisfied that there were 'serious and  compelling  family
    or other considerations' making the claimant's  exclusion  undesirable.
    In reaching this conclusion the panel found that his  mother  lived  in
    the United States and had little involvement  in  his  life,  that  his
    father has had little to do with him  since  his  birth  and  that  his
    maternal grandmother with whom he still lives in this country had taken
    over parental responsibility.


26. The issue of ties was considered by this Tribunal in Ogundimu where  it
    said:


         "123. The natural and ordinary meaning of the word 'ties'  imports,
         we think, a concept involving something more than merely remote and
         abstract links to the country of proposed deportation  or  removal.
         It involves there being a continued  connection  to  life  in  that
         country; something that ties a claimant to his or  her  country  of
         origin. If this were not the case  then  it  would  appear  that  a
         person's nationality of the country of proposed  deportation  could
         of itself lead to a failure to meet the requirements of  the  rule.
         This would render the application of the rule,  given  the  context
         within which it operates, entirely meaningless. "


27. The only difference between the claimant's ties to Jamaica at the  time
    of the decisions in 2006  and  2012  is  the  passage  of  time  and  a
    consequent diminution of any residual ties that the claimant  may  have
    had to Jamaica. There is nothing in the decision now under  appeal,  or
    the evidence that was presented to the First-tier Tribunal  that  would
    have been likely to lead the panel to the conclusion that this 18  year
    old man who had been in the United Kingdom since the age of 7  had  any
    ties in Jamaica.  Ignoring his nationality and residence in Jamaica  as
    a child, the decision letter only suggests that he  could  re-establish
    ties with his estranged father if removed there, but that  is  not  the
    same as having the ties at present, even if the possibility of resuming
    the ties was realistic a fact that neither panel who heard the evidence
    in 2007 or 2012 seemed to think.


28. As to the second, we observe that  paragraph  398  of  the  Immigration
    Rules makes no reference to persons who  commit  crimes  as  juveniles.
    Although paragraph 398 (a) and (b) refer to 'imprisonment' of 12 months
    or four years  and  imprisonment  is  a  sentence  only  available  for
    offenders who are over 21 at the date of conviction (see s.89 Powers of
    Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act  2000),  s.38  (1)(c)  and  38  (2)(b)
    treats a term  of  detention  of  a  young  offender  as  a  period  of
    imprisonment. However, s. 33 (3) exempts from automatic  deportation  a
    person who was under the age of 18 at the date of conviction. This  was
    doubtless the reason the Secretary  of  State  based  the  decision  on
    paragraph  398  (c):  'persistent  offender  who  shows  a   particular
    disregard for the law' but no reference is  made  to  the  age  of  the
    offender at the time of  the offence or the conduct.


29. By contrast the decision of the Grand Chamber in Maslov is clear:

        1. 'The Court would stress that while  the  criteria  which  emerge
           from its case-law and are spelled out in the  Boultif  and  �ner
           judgments are meant to facilitate the application of  Article  8
           in expulsion cases by domestic courts, the weight to be attached
           to the respective criteria will inevitably vary according to the
           specific circumstances of each case.  Moreover,  it  has  to  be
           borne  in  mind  that  where,  as  in  the  present  case,   the
           interference  with  the  applicant's  rights  under  Article   8
           pursues, as a legitimate aim, the  "prevention  of  disorder  or
           crime" (see paragraph 67 above), the above  criteria  ultimately
           are designed to help evaluate the extent to which the  applicant
           can be expected to cause  disorder  or  to  engage  in  criminal
           activities.
        1. In a case like the present one, where the person to be  expelled
           is a young adult who has not yet founded a family  of  his  own,
           the relevant criteria are:
           -     the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the
             applicant;
           -     the length of the applicant's stay  in  the  country  from
             which he or she is to be expelled;
           -     the time elapsed since the offence was committed  and  the
             applicant's conduct during that period;
           -     the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with  the
             host country and with the country of destination.
        1. The Court  would  also  clarify  that  the  age  of  the  person
           concerned can play a  role  when  applying  some  of  the  above
           criteria.  For  instance,  when   assessing   the   nature   and
           seriousness of the offences committed by an applicant, it has to
           be taken into account whether he or  she  committed  them  as  a
           juvenile or as  an  adult  (see,  for  instance,  Moustaquim  v.
           Belgium, judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 193, p.  19,
           � 44, and Radovanovic v. Austria, no. 42703/98, � 35,  22  April
           2004).'


30. The importance of this for deportation appeals was re-affirmed  by  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in JO (Uganda) [2010] EWCA  Civ  10  at
    paragraph 21:


           "Where the person to be deported is a young adult  who  has  not
           yet founded a family life of his own,  the  subset  of  criteria
           identified in para  71  of  the  Maslov  judgment  will  be  the
           relevant ones.  Further, paras 72-75 of that judgment  underline
           the importance of age in the  analysis,  including  the  age  at
           which the offending occurred and the age  at  which  the  person
           came to the host country.  This is pulled together in  para  75:
           for a settled migrant who has lawfully spent all  or  the  major
           part of his or her childhood and youth in the host country, very
           serious reasons are required to justify expulsion; and  this  is
           all the  more  so  where  the  person  concerned  committed  the
           relevant offences as a juvenile."


31. This learning was summarised by the Upper Tribunal in the  decision  in
    Masih (above) and it would have been an error of law for the FtT not to
    have considered  such  issues  and  applied  the  principles  set  out,
    whatever the Immigration Rules provide.   As  the  Upper  Tribunal  has
    explained in Iguazu (above) and Ogundimu (above), where the Immigration
    Rules do not reflect the law it is the law  as  laid  down  in  primary
    legislation that must be followed.  There are two respects relevant  to
    the present appeal where the Rules do not reflect the law: the  failure
    to take into account the age of the offender at the date of the offence
    and the failure to direct the  attention  of  decision  makers  to  the
    solidity of the  ties  as  opposed  to  their  mere  existence.   As  a
    consequence the panel was entitled to attach weight to  the  claimant's
    youth at the time of the offending, and even if  the  presence  of  his
    estranged father was a tie at all (contrary to our observations  above)
    it was manifestly not a solid one.


32.  As regards the third point, with the rules making no provision for age
    this  must  in  our  view  be  a  paradigm  for  the  consideration  of
    exceptionality under paragraph 397  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  Nagre
    holds that the consideration of exceptionality involves an  examination
    of Article 8 ECHR and its established principles. The  panel  undertook
    this exercise and was entitled to reach the conclusions on  this  issue
    that it did.


 Ground Two


33. So far as the  consideration  of  the  claimant's  gang  membership  is
    concerned, it is very clear from the determination that the  panel  not
    only took full account of this factor in reaching  their  decision  but
    also that they found this to be a matter of  considerable  concern.  In
    paragraph 54 the panel mention the  claimant's  membership  of  the  QC
    gang, referring to the earlier part  of  the  determination  where  the
    claimant's involvement is recited in detail.


34. In Masih the UT directed FtT judges to assess the  seriousness  of  the
    conduct relied on in the deportation decision by reference to the trial
    judge's sentencing remarks. The panel applied this guidance.  The trial
    judge said this  (Home Office Bundle G3):


           'Such gangs are not to be confused with groups of criminals  who
           commit serious organised crime. These gangs such as the QC gang,
           as opposed to the so-called professional criminal gangs, consist
           of persons who individually are sad and pathetic and  only  find
           meaning  in  their  lives  in  group  behaviour,  often  of   an
           antisocial kind. Notwithstanding the fact that gangs such as the
           QC consist of the miserably  inadequate,  they  are  however,  a
           cause for great concern to the public because of the impact they
           have on the ordinary community life in the inner city  areas  of
           London.'


    A little later he added:


           'There is an aspect of  gang  culture  which  gives  rise  to  a
           mitigating  feature,  namely  that  the   younger   members   or
           associates of the gang must be regarded as being vulnerable  and
           potentially victims themselves. Similarly, those who  are  older
           and ought to know better can be seen as  leaders  if  not  in  a
           formal sense in the gang'


    Addressing the  claimant,  who  was  one  of  five  defendants  he  was
    sentencing, he said, after describing him as a runner:


           'I bear in mind your youth and that you were 16 at the  time  of
           the commission of offences. But you have a terrible  record  for
           one so young and you are destined for a  miserable  life  unless
           you get a  grip  on  yourself.  I  have  to  bear  in  mind  the
           principles  guiding  the  sentencing  of  young  offenders.   In
           particular I have to bear in mind that you are a  young  man  in
           need of discipline.'


    We do not have a copy of the Court of Appeal's remarks when it  reduced
    the length of the detention by six months but in the  circumstances  we
    are confident that they  did  not  take  a  more  severe  view  of  the
    claimant's criminality and prospects.


35. The panel also refer to the claimant's criminality and  note  that  his
    recent good behaviour has not been faultless. The seriousness that  the
    panel place on the claimant's gang membership  is  reflected  in  their
    agreement that if the claimant returns to gang membership  and  commits
    further offences there is no question that he would be deported.


36. We would add to what the Tribunal said in Masih, that where the  course
    of conduct relied on the deportation decision includes conduct that has
    not resulted in a criminal charge or conviction, the panel will need to
    take that conduct  into  account  despite  the  absence  of  sentencing
    remarks (see Bah (EO (Turkey) - liability to deport) [2012] UKUT  00196
    (IAC)).


37. Here the sentencing  judge  was  aware  of  the  intelligence  material
    relating to gang membership but in so far as  that  material  disclosed
    conduct that was not before the criminal court, he concluded  he  could
    not aggravate the sentence on that account (see Home Office Bundle G4).
    This is not a restraint that would  be  applicable  to  a  panel  in  a
    deportation appeal. It may well be that  taken  as  a  whole  continued
    association with gangs who commit violent conduct would amount  to  the
    weighty reasons justifying the expulsion of even a young  offender  who
    has spent much of his childhood in the United Kingdom.


38. However we are satisfied that this panel understood  the  evidence  and
    its implications and  the  issues,  properly  directed  themselves  and
    reached a conclusion it  was  entitled  to  reach.  This  was  a  young
    offender in need of discipline who was vulnerable to the inducements of
    gang life but who had  now  received  his  first  substantial  term  of
    detention and was well aware of the consequences if he reverted to  his
    former way of life. There was no error of law on  this  aspect  of  the
    decision entitling us to re-make it.  Giving weight to a factor one way
    or another is for the fact  finding  Tribunal  and  the  assignment  of
    weight will rarely give rise to an error of law.

 Ground Three


39. Finally, Mr Hibbs  proposed  that  the  claimant's  immigration  status
    should be a factor held against him in the proportionality balance.  We
    reject that suggestion.


40. The claimant came to this country lawfully at the age of 7. He  applied
    for an extension of stay in time and he successfully  appealed  against
    the decision to refuse to grant indefinite leave. Although  he  had  no
    right to settlement when he first arrived there has been no defiance of
    immigration control or breach of the immigration  laws.  In  any  event
    given his age at the time, any  period  of  irregular  stay  could  and
    should not be held against his status as a settled migrant.


 Conclusions


41. The existence of an error of law is a necessary  condition  to  setting
    aside a decision but not a sufficient one (see  Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 s.12 (2) (a)).  Where any error is not material to
    the outcome, the  Upper  Tribunal  will  not  normally  set  aside  the
    decision below and re-make it.


42. The only arguable error of law was the failure to explain how paragraph
    399A(b) applied to the facts of this case.  We do not consider any such
    failure to  be  material  or  capable  of  having  any  effect  on  the
    conclusions for the reasons we have given in  response  to  ground  one
    above.


43. We do not re-make the decision and the appeal of the Secretary of State
    is dismissed. Before we  depart  from  this  appeal  we  re-affirm  the
    warning given the claimant by the panel. He is now  nearly  19.  If  he
    commits a significant offence  or  resumes  association  with  criminal
    gangs he will be deported irrespective of his personal ties.


44. Both members of the panel  have  contributed  to  the  making  of  this
    decision.
