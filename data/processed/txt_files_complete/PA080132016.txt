                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:    Mr P Duffy (Senior Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent: Mr A Gilbert (counsel instructed by Wimbledon
Solicitors)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the
   First-tier Tribunal of 13 February 2017 allowing the  appeal  of  VV,  a
   citizen of Sri Lanka, itself brought against the  decision  of  1  March
   2016 to refuse his asylum claim.


2. VV's asylum claim is based on having been forcibly recruited to the LTTE
   in January 2009. He was then detained by the army from March 2009  until
   October 2015, during which period he was tortured, before being released
   to the custody of his uncle and father-in-law. He married his  now  wife
   immediately upon release, on  12  October  2015.  He  fled  to  the  UK,
   arriving on 20 October 2015, and claimed asylum.


3. A medical report from Dr Hajioff stated that  VV  presented  with  scars
   consistent with his description of their  acquisition,  and  which  were
   unlikely to be attributed to "self injury by proxy".  He  suffered  from
   chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.


4. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that VV was a vulnerable witness  given
   a medical report which raised concerns  as  to  his  mental  health  and
   ability to give evidence given he was of below average intelligence.  It
   referred to extracts from the Home Office Operational Guidance  Note  of
   August 2016, particularly the following:


      "6.5.2 The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada reported in
      February 2015 that: 'Sources report that individuals returning from
      abroad are particularly subject to screening.' ... A July 2015
      International Truth & Justice Project (ITJP) Sri Lanka report on Sri
      Lanka's Survivors of Torture and Sexual Violence 2009-2015 stated
      that: 'A security force insider testified since the presidential
      election in 2015 that military intelligence officials from Joseph Camp
      were actively looking for any Tamils returning home from abroad in
      order to interrogate them. The witness stated that the intention was
      to abduct, detain and torture them.' ...
      6.5.5 The International Crisis Group noted in an August 2015 report
      that: 'Tamils returning from abroad continue to be arrested under the
      PTA [Prevention of Terrorism Act] on suspicion of old LTTE
      involvement. According to some reports, after police detention, many
      are sent to the military-run rehabilitation program. Tamil politicians
      and activists allege that secret detention centres established by the
      old government continue, though officials deny this.' ...
      6.5.6 In an August 2015 study of 148 Sri Lankan torture cases
      perpetrated since the end of the Sri Lankan civil war in May 2009,
      Freedom From Torture recorded that 139 people (94 percent of all
      cases) were of Tamil ethnicity, and the majority (142) described an
      association with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at some
      level and/or said that they had been associated with the LTTE by the
      Sri Lankan authorities in some way (96 percent of all cases). It
      further reported that 'It is of particular concern to Freedom from
      Torture that more than one third of the people whose cases were
      reviewed in this study were detained and tortured in Sri Lanka after
      returning from the UK following the end of the armed conflict (55 of
      148 cases or 37- [percent]). Most had been in the UK as students but
      three had claimed asylum and were forcibly removed after their asylum
      claims were rejected. All but seven of these people were detained
      within weeks of their arrival in Sri Lanka and the majority were
      specifically interrogated about their reasons for being in the UK,
      their activities and/or their contacts in the UK. Twenty-one people
      were accused of attending particular protests and demonstrations in
      the UK and eleven were shown photographs taken at these events'. ..."


5. The First-tier Tribunal considered the credibility of  the  Respondent's
   account. The Judge was very concerned with  the  lack  of  particularity
   provided in the evidence regarding the very lengthy period of  detention
   which was central to the claim: aspects  of  the  account  were  vividly
   detailed, yet that long imprisonment was  glossed  over,  and  his  wife
   addressed it only in two lines of her  own  statement;  her  father  was
   similarly brief in his treatment of  this  period.  There  were  various
   discrepancies and vagaries in his account. The judge considered that the
   lack of interest evinced by the authorities in the Respondent  following
   his departure from Sri Lanka was inconsistent with his facing  any  real
   risk of ill treatment on a return.


6. The medical evidence offered only limited support to VV's account  given
   the descriptor "consistent" was defined  in  the  Istanbul  Protocol  as
   being used to report a presentation that was relatively non-specific and
   permitting of "many other  possible  causes."  Overall,  the  First-tier
   Tribunal rejected the veracity of his story, because it was  implausible
   that the Sri Lankan state would  visit  such  lengthy  detention  on  an
   epileptic fisherman of below average intelligence whose involvement with
   the LTTE cause was minor; and as, had he been detained for so  long,  it
   was unlikely that arrangements for his escape would not have  been  made
   sooner, or that he would have been able to  leave  the  country  without
   difficulty.


7. Stepping back  from  the  individual  facts  of  his  case  and  broadly
   assessing risk based on VV facing  return  as  a  failed  asylum  seeker
   without a passport and on emergency travel documents, and being a  Tamil
   with limited historic involvement with the LTTE, the background evidence
   cited above from the Respondent's OGN indicated a real risk of detention
   on return.


8. The Secretary of State appealed against that decision on the basis  that
   the First-tier Tribunal had not determined  whether  there  were  cogent
   reasons to depart from the extant Country Guidelines, and permission  to
   appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on 13 March  2017  on  the
   basis that the Judge may have erred in relying on risk categories beyond
   those identified by the prevailing authorities.


9. Mr Duffy submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to apply  the
   threshold test of evaluating  whether  there  were  cogent  reasons  for
   departing from the Country Guidelines decision below.


10. Mr Gilbert submitted that  there  were  multiple  authoritative  sources
   cited in the OGN relied upon  that  post-dated  the  Country  Guidelines
   decision. The reasons given by the First-tier Tribunal were cogent  when
   viewed objectively; it was for the Upper Tribunal to apply  the  cogency
   threshold, not the judge below.


11. I invited submissions on the disposition of the appeal were  I  to  find
   an error of law within it. Mr Duffy considered the factual  findings  to
   be clear and thus for it to be suitable for final decision in the  Upper
   Tribunal; Mr Gilbert argued that in fact  there  was  no  clear  finding
   ultimately on whether or not the Respondent had been  detained  for  any
   particular period, notwithstanding the rejection of the long  period  of
   detention that he had asserted, and that no  finding  was  made  on  his
   activities in the UK.


Findings and reasons

12. I reserved my decision at the hearing  before  me  and  now  provide  my
   findings and reasons.


13. The Country Guidelines decision of GJ (post-civil  war:  returnees)  Sri
   Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 319 (IAC) concluded (I cite the headnote, in so far
   as relevant to this appeal) that:


    "(3) The government's present objective is to identify Tamil  activists
    in the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and to destabilise
    the unitary Sri Lankan state enshrined in Amendment  6(1)  to  the  Sri
    Lankan  Constitution  in  1983,  which  prohibits  the  'violation   of
    territorial integrity' of Sri Lanka.  Its focus is on  preventing  both
    (a) the  resurgence  of  the  LTTE  or  any  similar  Tamil  separatist
    organisation and (b) the revival of the civil  war  within  Sri  Lanka.
    (4) If a person is detained by the Sri Lankan security  services  there
    remains a real risk of ill-treatment or  harm  requiring  international
    protection. (5) Internal relocation is not an option within  Sri  Lanka
    for a person at real risk from the Sri Lankan  authorities,  since  the
    government now controls the whole of Sri Lanka and Tamils are  required
    to return to a named address after passing through the airport.  ...
    (7) The current categories of persons at real risk  of  persecution  or
    serious harm on return to Sri Lanka, whether in detention or otherwise,
    are:
    (a) Individuals who are, or are  perceived  to  be,  a  threat  to  the
    integrity of Sri Lanka as a single  state  because  they  are,  or  are
    perceived to have a significant role in relation to post-conflict Tamil
    separatism within the diaspora and/or a renewal of  hostilities  within
    Sri Lanka. ...
    (d)  A  person  whose  name  appears  on  a  computerised  "stop"  list
    accessible at the airport, comprising a  list  of  those  against  whom
    there is an extant court order or  arrest  warrant.  Individuals  whose
    name appears on a "stop" list will be stopped at the airport and handed
    over to the appropriate Sri Lankan authorities, in  pursuance  of  such
    order or warrant."


14. And from the text of GJ:


      "308. During the re-documentation process in the United Kingdom, or at
      the airport on return, a forced returnee can expect to be asked about
      his own and his family's LTTE connections and sympathies.
      309. Those with Sri Lankan passports returning on scheduled flights
      will be able to walk through Colombo airport without difficulty,
      unless their names are on a "stop" list, by reason of an outstanding
      Court order or arrest warrant. Those on a "watch" list are not stopped
      at the airport but will be monitored and if considered to be a
      destabilisation risk, may be picked up from their home area.
      310. There are no detention facilities at the airport. Although
      individuals may be interviewed at the airport by the security forces,
      the Sri Lankan authorities now aim to move returnees relatively
      quickly out of the airport and on their way to their home areas and to
      verify whether they have arrived there soon afterward. If the
      authorities have an adverse interest in an individual, he will be
      picked up at home, not at the airport, unless there is a "stop" notice
      on the airport computer system. There is no evidence that strip
      searches occur at the airport; the GOSL's approach is intelligence-led
      rather than being driven by roundups and checkpoints as it was during
      the civil war."


15. The Home Office August 2016 Guidance states


      "A person being of Tamil ethnicity would not in itself warrant
      international protection. Neither in general would a person who
      evidences past membership or connection to the LTTE unless they have
      or are perceived to have a significant role in relation to post-
      conflict Tamil separatism or appear on a 'stop' list at the airport."


16. Stanley Burnton LJ in SG (Iraq) [2012] EWCA  Civ  940  �47  stated  that
   "decision makers and  tribunal  judges  are  required  to  take  Country
   Guidance determinations into account, and to  follow  them  unless  very
   strong grounds supported by  cogent  evidence,  are  adduced  justifying
   their not doing so." In so doing he had regard to predecessor provisions
   to those now found in the Practice Directions  of  the  Immigration  and
   Asylum Chambers of the First tier Tribunal and the  Upper  Tribunal  (13
   November 2014):


    "12.2 ... unless it has been expressly superseded or  replaced  by  any
    later "CG" determination, or is inconsistent with other authority  that
    is  binding  on  the  Tribunal,  such  a  country  guidance   case   is
    authoritative in any subsequent appeal, so far as that appeal:
    (a) relates to the country guidance issue in question; and
    (b) depends upon the same or similar evidence. ...
    12.4 Because of the principle that like cases should be treated in like
    manner, any failure to follow a clear,  apparently  applicable  country
    guidance case or to show why it does not apply to the case in  question
    is likely to be regarded as grounds for appeal on a point of law."


17. This was clearly an appeal where the findings of the Country  Guidelines
   decision in GJ were highly relevant to the issues considered relevant by
   the First-tier Tribunal:  quite  expressly  GJ  creates  specified  risk
   categories, and it considered the general  risk  of  return  for  failed
   asylum seekers. There is no reference in the decision of the  First-tier
   Tribunal whatsoever to the requirement  identified  in  SG  (Iraq)  that
   findings in a Country Guidelines decision should be departed  from  only
   where the evidence reaches a certain threshold,  that  of  "very  strong
   grounds supported by cogent evidence."


18. I do not accept Mr Gilbert's submission that  the  question  of  cogency
   falls to be evaluated by the Upper Tribunal only. The  reality  is  that
   the primary fact-finder, the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  has
   evaluated the evidence before him via the wrong lens. It is not possible
   to determine whether the Judge below  would  have  considered  that  the
   material that impressed him on a consideration  without  regard  to  the
   appropriate threshold would have justified departure from  GJ  based  on
   very strong grounds.


19. This leaves the question as to whether any further hearing should be  by
   way of continuation in the Upper Tribunal or in the First-tier Tribunal.
   I do not consider there is any lack of clarity in the findings as to the
   Respondent's claimed detention: as I read his case he  asserted  only  a
   single period of detention at the hands of the security forces and  that
   has clearly been found incredible. However, Mr  Gilbert  made  it  clear
   that VV he had put a case based on diaspora activities before the First-
   tier Tribunal previously (albeit that at the time  of  his  full  asylum
   interview he disclaimed any such involvement). No findings were made  on
   this aspect of the case. Accordingly it seems to me  that  it  would  be
   appropriate, in order for the requisite anxious scrutiny to be  afforded
   to his claim, that the appeal be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, to
   leave open the possibility of a further appeal in order to  ensure  that
   the next decision below is a lawful one.


20. I accordingly allow the appeal to the extent that it is remitted to  the
   First-tier Tribunal. The findings as to the Appellant's  experiences  in
   Sri Lanka are to stand. The question  of  his  involvement  in  diaspora
   activities, and the  risks  he  faces  based  on  his  personal  profile
   including those activities,  will be a matter for the Tribunal below  to
   evaluate.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law.
    The appeal remitted for re-hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

ANONYMITY DIRECTION

Given that this appeal involves a fear of persecution held by  a  vulnerable
asylum seeker with family members remaining in  the  country  of  origin,  I
make a direction  under  Rule  13  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of Court proceedings.
