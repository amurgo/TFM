                           EMMANUEL ELUMA OSAZUWA
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1.       The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria. He appealed  against  a
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 23 February  2018
       dismissing his appeal against a decision of the Secretary  of  State
       dated 4 December 2017 refusing the appellant a  permanent  residence
       card as a former family member of an EEA 2016 national.


    2.       At the  hearing  on  22  November  2018,  Mrs  Pettersen,  who
       appeared for the Secretary of State, told me that the respondent did
       not oppose the setting aside of the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision.
       Subsequently, she wrote to me on 3 December 2018 to state  that  the
       appeal should be remade allowing the  appeal  as  the  Secretary  of
       State is satisfied that the appellant has now provided  satisfactory
       evidence of his former wife's identity.


Notice of Decision

        The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. I have  remade
    the decision. The appeal against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision
    dated 4 December 2017 is allowed.


                               Signed
