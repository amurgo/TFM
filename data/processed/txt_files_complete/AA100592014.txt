For the appellant:     Mr A Reza, instructed by Sultan Lloyd Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, an Iranian national, appeals  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Gurung-Thapa promulgated 19.3.15,  dismissing
    on all grounds his appeal against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State, dated 4.11.14, to refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and
    human rights claims and to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the
    appeal on 26.2.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    17.4.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins granted permission to appeal  on
    24.6.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 6.4.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. I found no material error of law in the making of the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision  of  Judge  Gurung-
    Thapa to be set aside. Having announced my decision at the  hearing,  I
    now give my reasons.

 5. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows.

 6. As explained in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, this appellant
    was refused asylum  in  2011  but  granted  discretionary  leave  until
    September 2012. Before expiry of that leave he submitted an application
    for further leave to remain, refused  more  than  two  years  later  on
    4.11.14, with a removal direction.

 7. The appellant claims to have been engaged with  his  older  brother  in
    smuggling alcohol but the home they shared with their mother was raided
    on 25.3.11, alcohol found, and his brother arrested. The following  day
    the authorities returned for the appellant, but  he  hid  and  was  not
    discovered. That evening his brother returned home with a bruised  face
    having been interrogated and tortured and said  he  was  only  released
    after  telling  the  authorities  that  the  alcohol  belonged  to  the
    appellant, explaining why they had come for him. Arrangements were made
    for the appellant to flee Iran, with the assistance of  an  agent.  The
    appellant fears that if returned to Iran he will face imprisonment  for
    alcohol smuggling and will face  inhuman  and  degrading  treatment  in
    prison.

 8. The asylum claim was  refused,  his  claim  not  engaging  the  Refugee
    Convention. Whilst it was accepted that he had assisted his brother  in
    alcohol smuggling the remainder of his factual account was  disbelieved
    as inconsistent and not credible.  Paragraph  339L  was  considered  in
    relation to  the  unsubstantiated  claim  that  his  brother  had  been
    detained, but he was not given the benefit of the doubt because he  did
    not meet condition (iii) as aspects of his account of problems in  Iran
    were not coherent or consistent. It was  accepted  that  the  appellant
    exited Iran illegally, but relying on SB (risk on return -illegal exit)
    Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053, the appellant did not meet any of the  risk
    factors and faced no risk on return on account of his illegal exit.

 9. The application for further leave to remain was not treated as a  fresh
    asylum claim and there was no further evidence that he was  of  adverse
    interest to the Iranian authoritites. However, he had by  then  reached
    the age of 19 and would no longer  be  returning  as  an  unaccompanied
    minor, which was why  he  was  granted  discretionary  leave  in  2011.
    Attempts to trace his family were unsuccessful. He  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM or paragraph  276ADE,  and  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances insufficiently recognised  in  the  Rules  to
    justify granting leave to remain outside the  Rules  on  the  basis  of
    article 8 ECHR.

10. The appellant has lodged a Judicial Review application in  relation  to
    the refusal of being granted a  right  of  appeal  against  the  asylum
    decision of 2011.

11. At �45  of  the  decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found  the
    appellant's evidence not remotely credible.  His  factual  account  was
    largely disbelieved and the judge did not accept that either he or  his
    brother had come to the attention of the authorities at all.

12. In considering the risk on return, reliance was placed  on  SB  and  BA
    (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on return)  Iran  CG  [2011]  UKUT  36
    (IAC), to the effect that Iranians who  left  illegally  and  returned,
    whether by compulsion or voluntarily, are not in general exposed  to  a
    real risk of persecution. The judge concluded that the appellant  would
    not be at risk on return.

13. In this regard the appellant now relies on  background  information  to
    the contrary in the extracts from the COIR and OGN  citing  an  Amnesty
    International account and that of  an  unnamed  judge  which  have  now
    become familiar to the tribunal. Mr Reza submitted that  the  Secretary
    of State and the  judge  failed  to  have  regard  to  this  background
    material in assessing the risk on return.

14. In relation to the risk on return as a failed asylum seeker  or  having
    made an illegal  exit,  and  the  appellant's  reliance  on  background
    information of potential risks, in DSG & Ors (Afghan  Sikhs:  Departure
    from CG) Afghanistan [2013], and SG (Iran) [2012] EWCA Civ 940, it  was
    held that unless it has been expressly superseded  or  replace  by  any
    later CG determination, or is inconsistent with other authority that is
    binding on the Tribunal, such a country guidance case is  authority  in
    any subsequent appeal, and that decision makers and Tribunal judges are
    required to take country guidance determinations into account,  and  to
    follow them, "unless very strong grounds supported by cogent  evidence,
    are adduced, justifying their not  doing  so.  To  do  otherwise  would
    amount to an error of law."

15.  I  find  that  the  evidence  now  relied  on  by  the  appellants  is
    insufficient to displace the current country guidance relied on by  the
    judge as to risk on return.  There  are  obvious  shortcomings  in  the
    relied on passages. One  is  distinctly  lacking  in  detail,  with  no
    examples cited, and the other refers  to  existing  laws  cited  by  an
    unnamed judge. These two extracts post-date the CG, but on the test for
    departing from CG, set out above, the judge  considered  the  objective
    evidence available and was entitled  to  follow  the  country  guidance
    cases cited at �27. The background  material  cannot  be  described  as
    cogent or amounting to  strong  grounds  to  depart  from  the  country
    guidance so as to render reliance on the country guidance an  error  of
    law.

16. The grounds also rely on other background information to  suggest  that
    children can expect violent  treatment  for  consuming  alcohol  and  a
    fortiori can expect the same or worse for smuggling  alcohol.  Reliance
    is place on PJ (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1011 to suggest  that
    there was an  obligation  on  the  Secretary  of  State  to  draw  this
    background material to the attention  of  the  Tribunal.  Mr  Reza  was
    unable to confirm that this background information had been put  before
    the judge or the judge's  attention  drawn  to  it  at  any  stage.  It
    certainly does not feature in the appellant's appeal  bundle.  However,
    the Secretary of State did not accept that the appellant's brother  had
    been caught,  detained,  or  tortured  in  relation  to  their  alcohol
    smuggling and neither did the judge. Thus  there  can  be  no  material
    error of law in failure to have regard to it, either by  the  Secretary
    of State or the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

17. Mr Reza relied on KS (benefit  of  the  doubt)  [2014]  UKUT  0052  and
    submitted that the appellant's general credibility had been accepted by
    both the Secretary of State and the judge and that all five  conditions
    under paragraph 339L were met, so that the judge should have given  the
    appellant the benefit of the doubt in relation to the  claim  that  his
    brother had been detained, tortured and gave the  appellant's  name  to
    the authorities. However, the judge specifically found the story of the
    brother's arrest to have been fabricated in order to bolster his asylum
    claim. At �38 the  judge  accepted  that  the  appellant  had  given  a
    consistent and credible account of assisting his brother  in  smuggling
    and was able to give detailed answers about this issue, including about
    the supply chain and smuggling routes, all of which was consistent with
    objective information. However, it is regard to the same  issue  as  to
    the detention, interrogation, torture and reason  for  release  of  his
    brother, that both the Secretary of State and the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge found his account implausible, inconsistent,  and  not  credible.
    The Rule 24 response  submits  that  the  judge's  findings  are  fully
    compliant with paragraph  339L,  (iii)  of  which  requires  that  "the
    person's statements are found to be coherent and plausible." The  judge
    in fact, for  cogent  reasons  given,  did  not  find  the  appellant's
    evidence on this issue to be remotely credible.

18. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the appellant met all  of
    the criteria under 339L, for the same reason as cited  in  the  refusal
    decision and the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  namely,  that
    aspects of the appellant's account regarding his problems in Iran  were
    neither coherent nor consistent and this failure was not due to his age
    or lack of education, as he had been able to provide a detailed account
    consistent in other areas. In the circumstances this  ground  discloses
    no error of law.

19. Mr Reza also relied on the principle of  corrective  leave,  suggesting
    that the appellant was unlawfully denied an effective  remedy  (appeal)
    against the refusal of his asylum claim and the failure  to  trace  his
    family or have regard to his best interests.

20. In  relation  to  the  tracing  claim,  at  �51  the  judge  noted  the
    appellant's claim that he has had no contact with his  family  and  has
    given the Home Office all the personal  details  about  his  family  to
    enable tracing. The Secretary of State in the  first  refusal  decision
    explained that the appellant had been provided with  information  about
    Red Cross tracing services and a pro-forma requesting  further  details
    about his family, explaining that it was  not  possible  to  trace  his
    family until further detailed information was provided,  but  the  form
    had not been returned by the date of the first  decision  in  September
    2011 and was  not  returned  until  October  2011,  after  the  refusal
    decision had been made. The appellant did not supply the  authority  to
    trace until June 2014. The refusal decision which  is  the  subject  of
    this appeal details  attempts  to  trace  in  2011  and  2014.  In  the
    circumstances, at �54 the judge did not accept that there had been  any
    failure to discharge the tracing duty.

21. At �53 onwards the judge noted the Secretary of  State's  response  and
    took into account the case authority of KA (Afghanistan) v SSHD  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 1014. However, contrary to the submissions in the  grounds  at
    �9, the judge did not accept the appellant's account that either he had
    come to the adverse attention of the authorities or that  he  had  lost
    touch with his immediate family members. At  �56  the  judge  found  no
    evidence that the Secretary of  State  was  in  breach  of  a  duty  to
    endeavour to trace the appellant's family. The  judge  did  not  accept
    that the appellant had discharged the obligation to establish a  proper
    foundation for the grant of leave on this ground. I find  no  error  of
    law in respect of this  ground.  The  judge  has  fully  justified  the
    findings and conclusion on this issue.

22. The grounds of appeal relating to article 8 argue that the judge  erred
    in failing to take into account the alleged tracing failure, which  the
    judge did not accept there had been, and failure to have regard to  the
    appellant's best interests as a child, which are claimed to be relevant
    to the private life assessment  under  paragraph  276ADE.  It  is  also
    alleged that there was an unreasonable two-year delay in  dealing  with
    his HPDL application and that this  should  reduce  the  weight  to  be
    attached to the public interest in immigration control.  Mr  Raza  also
    submitted that in the proportionality assessment  the  judge  erred  by
    failing to take into account the failure to grant a right of appeal  in
    the first refusal decision, and  argued  that  the  balancing  exercise
    should have fallen in the appellant's favour.

23. In response to the issue of delay, Ms Johnstone pointed  to  the  delay
    being "only" 26 months and that that there has to  be  some  period  of
    consideration of a claim before it can be decided upon;  it  cannot  be
    that any delay gives rise to corrective  leave.  During  that  26-month
    period the Secretary of State sought to trace  the  appellant's  family
    and during the same period he was also pursing the right of  appeal  by
    Judicial Review. The Secretary of State did not accept that  there  had
    been any delay in making the decision, but that any further time  spent
    in the UK after expiry of his discretionary leave  has  been  with  the
    full benefit and conditions of those enjoyed  under  his  discretionary
    leave, and thus there had been no prejudice to him. There is nothing in
    fact to suggest that the appellant has been prejudiced by  the  alleged
    delay.

24. Ms Johnstone also pointed out  that  the  judge  was  not  entitled  to
    consider the failure to grant a right of appeal in the  first  refusal,
    as that refusal was not the subject of the appeal before the  Tribunal.
    In the circumstances, the issue cannot be regarded as impacting on  the
    appellant's private life, as argued by  Mr  Reza  in  relation  to  his
    article 8 submissions. I thus find no error of law on  this  ground  of
    appeal.

25.  The  judge,  including  from  �72  onwards,  considered  these  issues
    carefully. After considering all the relevant article  8  private  life
    considerations, the judge concluded, for the reasons cogently set  out,
    that the decision to remove was proportionate. I find no error  of  law
    on this or any of the other grounds of appeal.

Conclusions:

26. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  continue  the
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
