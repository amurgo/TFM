Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Price instructed by Mohammed & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order made  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
      Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither party  invited
      me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule 14  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan who  was  born  on  27  June
      1976.  On 1 October 2009, he was convicted at the Cardiff Crown  Court
      of conspiracy to supply a controlled drug and  on  5  March  2010  was
      sentenced to a term of 5 years imprisonment.  The  appellant  appealed
      against that conviction and sentence and on 2 November 2010 the  Court
      of Appeal reduced the appellant's sentence to one of  3  years  and  8
      months.

   3. On 4  November  2010  the  appellant  was  served  with  liability  to
      automatic deportation under the UK Border Act 2007.  On 7  March  2011
      the appellant claimed asylum.  On 31  March  2011  the  appellant  was
      served  with  a  notice  indicating  that  s.72  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  applied,  namely  that  he  had  been
      convicted of a particularly serious crime and there was a  presumption
      that he was a danger to the community such that  his  deportation  was
      justified even if he was a refugee.  On 15 August 2012, the  appellant
      underwent an asylum interview.  On 16 February 2013,  the  appellant's
      application for asylum was refused. In a decision letter of that date,
      the Secretary of State rejected the appellant's account to be at  risk
      from the Taliban  and  concluded  that,  in  any  event,  he  had  not
      demonstrated  an  objectively  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  in
      Afghanistan.  Further, the  Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  the
      presumption in s.72(2) that the appellant  had  been  convicted  of  a
      particularly serious crime and was a danger to the community  had  not
      been rebutted such that his deportation would not breach  the  Refugee
      Convention.  The Secretary of State issued a certificate under s.72(9)
      that the presumption in s.72(2) applied.  Finally,  the  Secretary  of
      State concluded  that  the  appellant's  deportation  did  not  breach
      Article 8 of the ECHR.

   4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a determination
      promulgated  on  18  June  2013,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  A
      Cresswell and Mr M E Olszewski JP) dismissed the appellant's appeal on
      all grounds.  First, the Tribunal concluded that the appellant had not
      rebutted the presumption under s.72(2) and  so  dismissed  his  appeal
      under the Refugee Convention.   Secondly, the Tribunal concluded  that
      the appellant  was  not  entitled  to  humanitarian  protection  under
      Article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive  (Council  Directive
      2004/83/EC) or under Articles 2 and  3  of  the  ECHR.   Finally,  the
      Tribunal  concluded  that  the  appellant's  deportation  would  be  a
      proportionate interference with the family  life  established  between
      himself  and   his   wife   and   step-children   and   step-grandson.
      Consequently, he had not established a breach  of  Article  8  of  the
      ECHR.

   5. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  on  a
      number of grounds.  Permission to appeal was initially refused by  the
      First-tier Tribunal but on 14 August 2013 Upper Tribunal Judge  Kebede
      granted the appellant permission to appeal.   Thus,  the  appeal  came
      before me.

The Submissions

   6. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Price  focussed  his  submissions  upon
      ground 1 and ground  4.  He  placed  no  reliance  upon  ground  2  (a
      challenge to the credibility of the appellant  and  other  witnesses);
      ground 3 (reliance upon the  Immigration  Rules)  and  ground  5  (the
      Tribunal's citation of case law).

   7. First, Mr Price submitted that the Tribunal  had  failed  properly  to
      assess the risk of  the  appellant  reoffending  in  the  future.   He
      submitted that the Tribunal was required  to  take  into  account  the
      appellant's post-release history  (see  Masih  (Deportation  -  Public
      Interest - Basic Principles) Pakistan [2012]  UKUT  0046  (IAC)).   Mr
      Price submitted that the Tribunal had failed  properly  to  take  into
      account  and  give  adequate  weight  to  the  fact  that  since   the
      appellant's release from immigration detention in  June  2011  he  had
      been living in the community for 2 years (by the date of the  hearing)
      without offending. Mr Price submitted that the Tribunal had been wrong
      in para 26(xii) of  its  determination  to  note  that,  although  the
      appellant had been out of trouble since his  release  from  prison  on
      licence, for most of the period he had been under the  supervision  of
      the Probation Service.

   8. Mr Price submitted that the failure to properly consider the  risk  of
      the appellant reoffending both vitiated the Tribunal's  assessment  of
      proportionality and its conclusion that the presumption under  s.72(2)
      of the 2002 Act had not been rebutted.

   9. Secondly, in relation  to  ground  4,  Mr  Price  submitted  that  the
      Tribunal had failed to take into account that the appellant  had  been
      granted indefinite leave to remain in March 2005.  Mr Price  submitted
      that not only immigration law breaches but also  a  clean  immigration
      history should be taken into account and he referred me to a  decision
      of the Strasbourg Court in Omoregie and Others v  Norway  (Application
      No 265/07) [2009] Imm AR 170.  He submitted that  the  fact  that  the
      appellant had been granted indefinite leave to remain was relevant  in
      the proportionality assessment as it demonstrated solidarity  and  the
      nature of his family ties in the UK which is a relevant criterion when
      assessing proportionality.  He  relied  upon  the  Strasbourg  Court's
      decision in �ner v Netherlands (Application No 46410/99) [2007] Imm AR
      303.

  10. Mr Price pointed out that the Tribunal had itself considered that  the
      question of proportionality was "quite finely balanced" (see  para  55
      of the determination).  He submitted that if the  Tribunal  had  taken
      into account that the  appellant  had  ILR  and  had  been  free  from
      offending for  two  years,  these  factors  might  well  have  made  a
      difference to its assessment of proportionality.

  11. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Richards  submitted  that  the
      Tribunal had conducted a thorough review of the relevant evidence  and
      had  carried  out  properly  the  balancing   exercise   inherent   in
      proportionality.

  12. As regards the risk of reoffending, Mr Richards acknowledged that  the
      Tribunal was in some difficulty in the absence of an OaSys  Report  or
      any other report dealing with the  appellant's  risk  of  reoffending.
      Nonetheless, Mr Richards submitted that the panel was required to make
      its  own  finding.  He  pointed  out  that  in  paragraph  55  of  its
      determination, the Tribunal had  concluded  that  the  "likelihood  of
      repetition  is  difficult  to  determine"  but  had  noted  that   the
      appellant's offence of conspiracy had been carried out over a year and
      he had made no real efforts to mend his ways.  Mr Richards pointed out
      that the Tribunal noted that  the  appellant's  offence  was  a  "very
      serious offence".  He submitted that the seriousness  of  the  offence
      and the public interest in deterring the commission  of  such  serious
      offences was taken into account by the Tribunal and it  was  a  matter
      for the Tribunal as to what "weight" it gave that factor and the other
      relevant factors taken into account.

  13. As regards the appellant's immigration status, Mr  Richards  submitted
      that, given the nature of his offending, that he had ILR was a  fairly
      neutral factor and, even if that had not been taken into  account,  it
      was not conceivable that the Tribunal would have come to a  difference
      conclusion if it had taken that factor into account.

Discussion

  14. I deal first with ground 1.

  15. The appellant came to the UK in 1999.  He claimed asylum but that  was
      refused and he was granted leave to remain until 22 March 2005.  On 12
      December 2002, he married a British citizen (Mrs "H").   On  17  March
      2005 he was granted indefinite leave to remain.   In  April  2008  the
      appellant and Mrs H divorced.   On  15  October  2009,  the  appellant
      remarried Mrs H.  The evidence before the Tribunal was that Mrs H  had
      four children, two of whom lived with the appellant and Mrs H.  One of
      Mrs H's children also had a son.

  16. The Judge dealt with the relationship between the appellant and Mrs  H
      and her children at para 26(xiii)-(xiv) as follows:

          "26.    (xiii)     Mrs H  described  a  violent  marriage  to  her
                       previous husband and told us that  her  children  had
                       had no contact with her previous husband for the past
                       10 years.  She told us  that  after  she  had  become
                       divorced from the Appellant, he had moved out of  the
                       family home for some weeks before she felt  that  she
                       had made the wrong decision.  Here again it was clear
                       that we were not being told  the  truth  because  the
                       Appellant  had  in  his  witness  statement  for  the
                       hearing made no mention of an absence of  weeks  only
                       and said : "We therefore got divorced on the 8  April
                       2008 but after this we still kept in  touch  and  our
                       relationship was able to rekindle.  I still loved  my
                       wife and children and as a result we remarried on  15
                       October 2009".  It did seem somewhat suspicious to us
                       that the couple would remarry on 15 October 2009 some
                       14 days after he was  convicted  of  a  very  serious
                       offence and facing a substantial prison sentence  and
                       probable deportation proceedings notwithstanding  Mrs
                       H's evidence to the effect that the couple had always
                       intended to  remarry  in  May  2009.   Certainly  the
                       remarriage took place when the Appellant was  subject
                       to the automatic deportation provisions by reason  of
                       the sentence he received and his situation  could  at
                       its very best be described as precarious.   The  rosy
                       picture that has been painted of family life may have
                       some of its origin in rose-tinted spectacles  because
                       it is clear from the evidence we heard  that  Mr  and
                       Mrs H had argued such that they became divorced;  the
                       Appellant remained at  home  during  this  period  of
                       disharmony and then the Appellant was absent from the
                       matrimonial home following the divorce  and  then  he
                       was absent again whilst on remand from February  2009
                       until his release on licence on 30 June 2011.  It  is
                       clear that the one constant and  reliable  source  of
                       parenting for all of the  children  throughout  their
                       lives has been Mrs H.

                 (xiv) It is very clear to us that the Appellant  is  loved
                       by his UK family and that he is very attached to  the
                       family.  The Appellant currently lives with Mrs H,  L
                       and M. The Appellant has a step-daughter and 3  step-
                       sons. K's son R, was born on 16  February  2012.   We
                       saw evidence of disturbed schooling in the case of  M
                       in 2010.  M told us that  the  Appellant  had  always
                       been his dad, this being the case since he first came
                       into his life when M was 2 years old.  M told us that
                       he was very close to the Appellant.  He told us  that
                       he would be devastated if his father was returned  to
                       Afghanistan, echoing the evidence of Mrs H and K  and
                       what we read from other family members.   M  told  us
                       that he is now 16 and had finished school,  but  that
                       arrangements had been made for  him  to  undertake  a
                       vocational  course  in  mechanics   from   September,
                       preparing  him  for  anticipated  work  as  a   motor
                       mechanic.  He is on the cusp of adulthood.   We  have
                       obviously had to pay close attention to the impact of
                       any decision upon each member of the  Appellant's  UK
                       family."

  17. At para 51, the Tribunal accepted that:

            "51. ...the Appellant does enjoy family  life  with  his  three
                 step-sons and step-daughter and with  his  wife  and  step-
                 grandson."

  18. At para 52, the  Tribunal  considered  the  "best  interests"  of  the
      children.  The Tribunal noted that the,

           "52.  ...children have lived entirely blameless  existences  and
                 they  cannot  be  held  in  any  way  responsible  for  the
                 behaviour of the Appellant".

  19. The Tribunal continued:

           "52.  ...Whilst we have concluded that it is  not  in  the  best
                 interests of the children to  have  the  role  model  of  a
                 person such as the Appellant, involved in the  large  scale
                 distribution of Class A drugs and "living a lie" so far  as
                 his  family  is  concerned  or  to  be  influenced  by  the
                 Appellant's behaviour, we have concluded that it  would  be
                 in M's best interests to see and have regular access to the
                 Appellant.  As we explained above,  we  do  not  find  this
                 Appellant to be a sound role model.  He has  for  the  most
                 part led an unemployed existence supported by his wife  and
                 we were not  presented  with  a  truthful  account  of  his
                 present efforts, or lack of them, to  find  work  and  were
                 wholly unsatisfied, by his evidence, that he had  made  any
                 real efforts to change his ways."

  20. At para 53, the Tribunal noted that both Mrs H and the  children  were
      British citizens and that her son M was still in education and that it
      would not be reasonable to expect Mrs H and the children  to  relocate
      to Afghanistan.  As a result, the Tribunal stated that:

           "53.  We have approached our decision, therefore, upon the basis
                 that the family will be  fractured  in  the  event  of  the
                 Appellant being deported and that M in particular (and  Mrs
                 H and the other children too) will be  very  upset  by  the
                 removal of their step-father and that the  behaviour  of  M
                 could be affected.  We recognise too that modern  forms  of
                 communication will be of little assuagement and that visits
                 to Afghanistan would be costly and unlikely."

  21. At paragraph 54, the Tribunal again returned to the interests of Mrs H
      and the children, in particular M as follows:

           "54.  We then move on to assess the best interests of the  child
                 in the context of the overall question of  proportionality.
                 Clearly, the best interests of M form a very important  and
                 weighty factor.  Weighty too is the interest of Mrs  H  and
                 the other children to whom the Appellant is  their  father.
                 We also need to have proper regard to the impact  that  the
                 removal of the Appellant will have  upon  his  own  private
                 life, as he had been in the UK now for a period of some  14
                 years, in the context of the lives of others who  hold  him
                 in regard."

  22. The Tribunal dealt with the  appellant's  offending  as  part  of  the
      proportionality exercise at para 55 of its determination as follows:

           "55.   In  the  event,  we  have  found  that  the  question  of
                 proportionality has been quite finely  balanced.   We  have
                 concluded, however, that the balance weighs more in  favour
                 of the Appellant's  deportation.   We  recognise  that  his
                 offending was at a very serious level for  a  year  and  we
                 must have  regard  to  deterrence  and  the  other  factors
                 detailed  in  N  (Kenya).   Whether  or  not  there  is   a
                 likelihood of repetition is difficult to determine; on  the
                 one hand, there is only one conviction, but  on  the  other
                 hand, the Appellant admitted to us that his  offending  had
                 carried on over a year and he provided scant evidence  that
                 he was making real efforts to mend his ways constructively.
                  In  the  end,  only  one  person  has  brought  about  the
                 Appellant's deportation and  the  sadness  that  that  will
                 bring to him, his family  and  friends,  and  that  is  the
                 Appellant himself.  He has committed a very serious offence
                 and appears to have taken no real steps to demonstrate that
                 there will  be  no  repetition.   He  committed  a  serious
                 offence for which he received  a  substantial  sentence  of
                 imprisonment.  Those involved in  the  supply  of  Class  A
                 drugs contribute to illness, death and financial  loss  for
                 many citizens.  The public, quite rightly, expects  the  UK
                 authorities to seek to deter those involved in such serious
                 offences; this is particularly so in the case of those  who
                 are provided with an opportunity to remain here  even  when
                 they have presented a dishonest claim for asylum  and  then
                 abuse that opportunity, as this Appellant  has  done,  even
                 repeating his falsehoods in  his  fresh  asylum  claim  and
                 being dishonest at the hearing.  As Sedley LJ indicated  in
                 Lee v SSHD (2011) EWCA, on different facts,  sometimes  the
                 bad  behaviour  of  a  father  can  lead  to   the   tragic
                 consequences  of  the  break-up  of  a  family;  with  some
                 sadness, we have found that such is the case here.  We  are
                 strengthened in that view by the guidance in SS (Nigeria)."

  23. That passage has to be seen in the context of the  Tribunal's  earlier
      consideration  and  assessment  of  the  evidence.    The   Tribunal's
      reference to the fact that the appellant had provided "scant evidence"
      of efforts to mend his  ways  and  had  taken  "  no  real  steps"  to
      demonstrate that there would not be a repetition, is a reference  back
      to the Tribunal's assessment of the appellant's evidence  in  relation
      to what, if any, courses he had undertaken in prison and his knowledge
      about his licence and bail conditions following release which  are  at
      para 26(viii)-(ix) as follows:

           "26.  (viii)     In  the  refusal  letter,  the  Respondent  had
                       commented upon  the  Appellant's  representations  in
                       relation to Section 72 and found that he  had  failed
                       to rebut the presumptions.  He had  argued  that  the
                       offence was a first offence, that he had taken  steps
                       to address his offending behaviour  and  that  he  no
                       longer associated with the individuals with  whom  he
                       had committed the offence.   The  Respondent  pointed
                       out that  he  had  not  given  specific  details  and
                       pointed out that the burden lay upon him to rebut the
                       presumptions.  Not surprisingly, Ms Williams explored
                       this issue during the hearing. The Appellant appeared
                       to be  remarkably  unconcerned.   He  was  unable  to
                       provide any clarity as to courses he may  have  taken
                       whilst in prison to address his  offending  behaviour
                       and could only point to one course, a  drugs  course,
                       which he told us he "had to do" on  the  instructions
                       of his personal officer.  This appeared to have  been
                       a course targeted at drug use rather than drug supply
                       and the Appellant had not  bothered  to  produce  the
                       certificate of the course and did not even appear  to
                       know precisely where it was.

                   ix) The Appellant's knowledge of the controls  which  had
                       been in place since his release from prison was  also
                       scant and concerning.  It was only  after  endeavours
                       on the part of his wife, who  after  giving  evidence
                       went and rang the Appellant's probation officer, that
                       the  Tribunal   received   the   clarity   that   the
                       Appellant's licence had been  completed  towards  the
                       end of last year.   Mr  Davies  was  unable  to  find
                       confirmation  of   the   appellant's   current   bail
                       conditions.  Worryingly,  the  Appellant  had  little
                       knowledge of what his bail conditions  actually  were
                       and did not appear  to  know  when  giving  his  oral
                       evidence that the bail conditions had been imposed by
                       the Tribunal rather than arising  from  his  licence.
                       He believed that he was still under licence  and  did
                       not know when his licence expired,  although  he  did
                       know  that  he  had  finished  with   his   probation
                       officer."

  24. Finally, at para 26(xi)-(xii) the Tribunal said this:

           "26.  (xi)  We note and  take  account  of  the  fact  that  the
                       Appellant has been in the UK since 1999 and has  been
                       convicted once only.

                 (xii) We note that the Appellant has been out  of  trouble
                       since his release from prison on  licence,  but  that
                       this was in the context of most of the period of  the
                       supervision  of  the  probation  service  under   his
                       licence."

  25. In reaching its decision the Tribunal did not, as  it  noted  at  para
      6(i) have the benefit of an  OaSys  or  other  report  concerning  the
      appellant's  offending  although  the  transcript   of   the   Judge's
      sentencing remarks was before the Tribunal.  Even in  the  absence  of
      such reports, the  Tribunal  was  required  in  assessing  the  public
      interest (flowing  from  the  legitimate  aim  of  the  prevention  of
      disorder or crime) to deal with the risk, if any, of the appellant re-
      offending on the evidence before it.    As is well known,  the  public
      interest has three important "facets" which were summarised by  Wilson
      LJ in OH (Serbia) v SSHD [2009] INLR 109 at [15] namely: (1) the  risk
      of re-offending by the person concerned; (2) the need to deter foreign
      nationals from committing serious crimes by leading them to understand
      that whatever the other circumstances, one  consequence  of  them  may
      well be deportation; and (3) the role of deportation as an  expression
      of society's revulsion  at  serious  crimes  and  in  building  public
      confidence in the treatment of foreign  citizens  who  have  committed
      serious crimes.  Those three facets of the public interest are engaged
      in automatic deportation cases  such  as  the  present  case  (see  RU
      (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 651 and EH (Jamaica) v SSHD [2012]
      EWCA Civ 1736).

  26. As will be clear from these passages in the Tribunal's  determination,
      which must be read as a whole, the Tribunal clearly had  in  mind  the
      seriousness of the appellant's offending.  He had been convicted of  a
      very serious offence, namely conspiracy to supply Class A drugs over a
      12 month period and had been apprehended in possession of  �  kilogram
      of pure heroin with a street value of around �225,000.  The  appellant
      was engaged in a "purely  commercial  enterprise"  as  the  sentencing
      Judge remarked.  There is  no  doubt  that  the  seriousness  of  this
      offence marked it out as one which required the facet  of  the  public
      interest  categorised  as  "deterrent"  to  have  a  substantial   and
      significant weight in the proportionality assessment.

  27. I do not accept Mr Price's submission that the Tribunal failed to take
      into account the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  not  committed  any
      offences since June 2011 when  released  from  immigration  detention.
      They were clearly alive to that fact at para 26(xii).  Likewise,  they
      were alive to the fact that the appellant had only been  convicted  of
      one such offence and so, at least as regards  serious  offending,  had
      committed no offences between 1999 and 2009 (see para 26(xi)).

  28. In my judgement, the Tribunal cannot be criticised for its comment  in
      para 26(xii) that the appellant's "clean record" since his release has
      been achieved during a period for most  of  which  he  was  under  the
      supervision of the probation service.  Rehabilitation and reducing  an
      offender's risk of reoffending is part and parcel of why the probation
      service is involved when an offender is  released  from  prison.   The
      Tribunal was entitled to take into  account  that  the  appellant  had
      little knowledge of any courses he had attended in prison and  of  the
      control imposed on him whilst  on  licence  or  whilst  on  bail.  The
      Tribunal had the opportunity to assess the  appellant's  evidence  and
      reach the view that he "appeared to be remarkably unconcerned" when he
      was giving evidence on these issues.

  29. In relation to the question of whether the appellant had rebutted  the
      presumption under s.72(2), the Tribunal said this at para  30  of  its
      determination.

           "30.   We  find  that  the  Appellant  has  not   rebutted   the
                 presumption.  We have had regard to  the  guidance  of  the
                 Court of Appeal in EN in so concluding.  We  find  that  he
                 was convicted of a particularly serious  crime,  which  has
                 been detailed above.  He was clearly a player in a cleverly
                 organised, sophisticated conspiracy involving a network  of
                 offenders, which involved substantial sums  and  which  had
                 the propensity to cause  severe  damage  to  the  country's
                 economy and the well-being of citizens of the UK.  We  find
                 that he does constitute a danger to the community.  He  was
                 described by the sentencing Judge thus:  "Mr H, Mr N and Mr
                 H were collectors or couriers of heroin, each of you  being
                 arrested in possession of it".  On  27  January  last  year
                 you, H, were  found  in  possession  of  just  short  of  a
                 kilogram of powder at between 10 and 14%  purity  and  that
                 translates as a weight at 100% purity of something  in  the
                 order of half a kilogram  of  pure  heroin  and  the  total
                 street value of those drugs  in  the  order  of  �225,000."
                 "There is no suggestion that any of you  were  addicted  to
                 Class A drugs and performed roles within the conspiracy  to
                 obtain drugs to feed a  drug  habit.   This  was  a  purely
                 commercial enterprise  entered  into  for  the  purpose  of
                 making money from those addicted to heroin of whom you were
                 all taking  advantage".   The  Appellant  appears  to  have
                 become involved at  a  moderately  high  level  in  a  very
                 serious  crime  where  he  was  trusted   by   his   fellow
                 conspirators to be in possession  of  a  huge  quantity  of
                 drugs of a significantly high value.  Such  things  do  not
                 happen by accident; they are  planned,  and  the  Appellant
                 admitted to us that he had been involved for a whole  year.
                 It was suggested to us that the  Appellant  had  shown  his
                 better side since being in prison, but we noted that he had
                 not been wholly honest with his wife about his  involvement
                 in the offences.  We also noted, for reasons which we  have
                 explained,  that  the  Appellant   was   still   practising
                 deception at the hearing.   His knowledge of  and  attitude
                 to his  licence  and  bail  conditions  was  worrying.   We
                 reminded ourselves that Section 72  creates  a  presumption
                 that the Appellant constitutes a danger to  the  community,
                 which may be rebutted, but concluded that when all  of  the
                 evidence on this issue was considered,  the  Appellant  had
                 been unable to rebut that presumption."

  30. In my judgement, the Tribunal was entitled to  reach  the  conclusions
      that it did first, in relation to the weight to be given to the public
      interest (para 55) and secondly, to conclude that  the  appellant  had
      failed to rebut the presumption that he was a danger to the  community
      (para 30).

  31. Turning to ground 4, I am not persuaded that the Tribunal did not have
      in mind that the  appellant  had  been  granted  ILR  in  March  2005.
      Although the Tribunal made no specific reference to it in its findings
      at paras 51-57, it is specifically mentioned  in  para  23(i)  of  the
      determination.  In any event, the relevance of  the  appellant  having
      ILR was, as Mr Price submitted, relevant to the criterion set  out  in
      [58] of �ner when assessing proportionality namely:

           "The solidarity of social, cultural and  family  ties  with  the
           host country and with the country of destination."

  32. The Tribunal fully dealt with this issue.  The Tribunal accepted  that
      the appellant had family life with his wife, step-children  and  step-
      grandson.  The Tribunal also accepted that the appellant had acted  as
      a parent for his step-children for the last 14 years  (see  para  52).
      The Tribunal further found that it was "in the best interests" of M to
      see and have regular access to the appellant" (para 52).  There is  no
      doubt that the Tribunal took into  account  the  "solidarity"  of  the
      appellant's life in the UK in assessing the disruption to his  "family
      life" that would be caused by his deportation.  The Tribunal  accepted
      that the family life  would  be  "fractured"  if  the  appellant  were
      deported  (para  53).   In  itself,  given  the  seriousness  of   the
      appellant's offending that the appellant had ILR added  little  weight
      to his claim to remain in the UK.

  33. Although Mr  Price  relied  on  the  Strasbourg  Court's  decision  in
      Omoregie and Others, he did not refer me to any  specific  passage  in
      the judgement.  That was, in any event, a "removal" case rather than a
      deportation case.  In my judgement, the Tribunal in this  appeal  took
      into account the substance of the appellant's connections with the  UK
      but concluded that the public  interest  outweighed  any  interference
      with his family life.  The Tribunal recognised that  the  question  of
      proportionality was "quite finely  balanced".   That  was,  no  doubt,
      because  the  effect  of  the  appellant's  deportation  would  be  to
      "fracture" his family life with his wife and step-family.  In  finding
      the  appellant's  deportation  to  be  proportionate,   the   Tribunal
      considered all relevant matters.  The weight to  be  attached  to  the
      public interest represented by the appellant's offending was primarily
      a matter for the Tribunal.  Its assessment and the weight given to the
      public interest cannot be characterised as perverse or irrational.

  34. Likewise, the Tribunal was entitled to find, having considered all the
      evidence, that the appellant had not rebutted  the  presumption  under
      s.72(2) of the 2002 Act and as a  result  his  deportation  would  not
      breach the Refugee Convention.  As I have already indicated, Mr  Price
      did not seek to challenge  the  Tribunal's  decision  to  dismiss  the
      appellant's appeal on any other ground.

Decision

  35. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's decision to  dismiss  the
      appellant's appeal did not involve the making of an error of law.  Its
      decision stands.

  36. The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
