Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Briddock, counsel, instructed by Alsters Kelley
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Blundell, Home Office Presenting Officer

There is no satisfactory evidence that WCPI members in the Kurdish  Regional
Governorates are at risk from IMIK or anyone else.  There is  some  evidence
that the WCPI has a presence both in the KRG and the rest of Iraq.

There is no satisfactory evidence  that  IMIK  now  enforces  its  views  by
violent means in the KRG.  It has six seats in the KRG parliament.

This determination does not consider issues relating to the WCPI or IMIK  in
the parts of Iraq that are not in the KRG. This determination supersedes  DH
(Risk - IMIK - KAA) Iraq CG [2002] UKIAT 05099 but does not consider  issues
relating to the WCPI or IMIK outside the KRG.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Iraq. He was born on 1 July 1976.  He  is
    a Kurd and used to live in the area now known as the KRG  (the  Kurdish
    Regional Governorates).  It  was  previously  known  as  the  KAZ  (the
    Kurdish Autonomous Zone).  He is a  member  of  the  Workers  Communist
    Party of Iraq (known variously as the WCPI and WCPI) and  he  expressed
    fear of both the PUK (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan) and the  IMIK  (the
    Islamic Movement of Kurdistan) if he were to be returned to Iraq.

Immigration history
   2. The appellant claims to have left Iraq by car on 6 November 2001,  and
      to have travelled via Iran to Turkey, arriving in the  United  Kingdom
      on  4 December  2001.   He says that he claimed asylum the  same  day.
      His application was refused on 17 May 2002. An appeal was dismissed on
      16 September 2002, apparently without considering the merits. He  made
      a fresh claim for asylum on 15 December 2004 which was refused  on  14
      April 2005.  He again appealed.  The appeal was heard  by  Immigration
      Judge Kumrai on 20 June 2005. That appeal was dismissed on both
      Refugee and Human Rights Convention grounds.

Basis of the Appellant's claim
3.   The appellant claimed to be from the Province of Sulaymaniyah and  said
    that he was a journalist for the Kurdistan New newspaper, which  was  a
    PUK publication.  He claimed that he wrote about daily life in  Kurdish
    society under the control of the PUK and  did  not  criticise  the  PUK
    directly.   He did however highlight weaknesses in the PUK's authority.
    He claimed that one of its leaders (Imat Ahmed) disliked him because he
    had exposed the inadequacies  in  its  authority,  mainly  relating  to
    energy and electricity supply.   Imat Ahmed was said to be not  only  a
    member of the PUK leadership, but also Minister of Industry and  Energy
    for the area.

4.   The appellant claimed to have  become  a  member  of  the  WCPI  on  12
    December 1999 and thereafter began to write articles for the  communist
    newspaper, Bo Peshawe.  He continued his employment with the  Kurdistan
    New newspaper. Bo Peshawe was banned on 24 June 2001 and  at  the  same
    time some members of the Party were attacked and killed. The  appellant
    claimed to have passed information to the communists from PUK newspaper
    archives.

5.   Prior the banning of Bo Peshawe, the appellant claimed to have  written
    articles for it that were critical of both IMIK and the PUK.   Although
    he initially wrote articles using his own name, he later used an alias.
     He claimed that he was threatened by IMIK members because of  critical
    articles he had written for the Kurdistan New Newspaper.    He  claimed
    to have been attacked on 20 July 2001 by people that he believed to  be
    members of the IMIK.   He believed that because  they  had  beards  and
    dressed like members of IMIK.  We note he  said  that,  notwithstanding
    that he was taken unconscious to hospital.  The police apparently  took
    a statement and carried out some inconclusive investigations.   He  did
    not report the attack to any other PUK authority, because  he  did  not
    know who the people were.  The appellant also claims that  he  received
    an 'arrest warrant' from IMIK on 9 October 2001.  This alleged that  he
    was anti-Islamic because of his writings. Finally, he claimed that,  on
    29 October 2001, his brother was shot dead by members of IMIK  as  they
    were walking together.  The appellant  believes  he  was  the  intended
    target.  He believes it was also carried out by IMIK  members,  because
    the men who fired the shots had long beards and wore Islamic dress.  He
    reported his brother's killing to the police  but  not  any  other  PUK
    authorities.

6.   The appellant claimed that he ceased  working  for  the  Kurdistan  New
    newspaper on 3 November 2001. On that day a friend, F, with whom he had
    worked in secret for  the  WCPI,  was  arrested  by  PUK  security  and
    intelligence services.  The appellant believes that F confessed to  the
    PUK that they had passed on information to the Communist Party and that
    consequently, the  next  day,  the  PUK  security  forces  visited  the
    appellant's house looking for him. He claimed they also looked for  him
    at the offices of the newspaper.  He was told about the  visit  by  his
    mother.  As a result, he immediately went into hiding, prior to leaving
    Iraq on 6 November.  The appellant said he could not then  have  sought
    refuge in the KDP (Kurdistan Democratic Party) controlled area  because
    the KDP and PUK were by then cooperating and he would have been  handed
    back to the PUK authorities.  He also maintained that if he returned to
    the KRG, or to any other part of  Iraq,  he  would  be  identified  and
    killed by IMIK.  He said it was because his writings had offended them,
    that they had issued what he described as the  arrest  warrant  against
    him, as well as trying to kill him. He also said that he was wanted  by
    the PUK authorities for having passed on confidential information about
    them to the Communist Party.

The Appeal before the Immigration Judge
7.   At the hearing of  the  appeal  the  appellant's  credibility  was  not
    challenged by the respondent. The only issue was the question  of  risk
    on  return.  The  Immigration  Judge  summarised  by  saying  that  the
    appellant's evidence had been consistent in relation to the core of his
    claim and that he had expressed a current fear of  both  IMIK  and  the
    PUK.  The Immigration Judge found that the appellant had established  a
    genuine current fear of return but that, in respect of  both  IMIK  and
    the PUK, the fears were not well-founded.  He dealt with  the  fear  of
    the two organisations separately, starting with  IMIK.   He  summarised
    the evidential difficulties by referring to the  'arrest  warrant'  and
    the death of the appellant's brother.  He  said  that  the  appellant's
    evidence in relation to the incidents was 'speculative'.   It  was  not
    persuasive because he was not able to identify the men who attacked him
    on 25 July as members of IMIK, at the time.  He said that at  the  time
    of the killing of  his  brother  he  had  not  been  certain  that  the
    perpetrators were members of IMIK despite the long  robes  and  Islamic
    dress, although he believed them to be so.  The Immigration Judge found
    that it was speculative to say that the  IMIK  had  discovered  he  was
    responsible for articles published against their ideology.  He found it
    was highly questionable that the IMIK had any authority or jurisdiction
    to issue a valid arrest warrant. Mr Briddock before  us  conceded  that
    the evidence (both then  and  now)  did  not  establish  any  power  or
    jurisdiction for IMIK to issue valid and lawful  arrest  warrants.   In
    considering the 'warrant' the Immigration  Judge  referred  to  Tanveer
    Ahmed [2002] UKIAT 00439.  He said he had not looked at the document in
    isolation, but with all the other evidence in the round to see  whether
    he should place any reliance on it.    He  decided  not  to  place  any
    reliance on it despite finding that the appellant was credible; he said
    that it could  be  that  IMIK  members  threw  the  document  into  the
    appellant's house to frighten him, but it was not a  valid  and  lawful
    arrest warrant.

8.   The Immigration Judge went on to consider IMIK.  He described it as  an
    Islamic militant group, whose political affiliation and motivation were
    unclear. He observed that the June 2000  Netherlands  General  Official
    Report on Iraq indicated that relations between the PUK  and  IMIK  had
    normalised  since  entering  into  negotiations  together.    He   then
    addressed what he described as the nexus test, to  decide  whether  any
    persecution would be on account of the appellant's  political  opinion.
    He concluded that the incidents on 25 July (the attack by two men  with
    beards and Islamic dress), 9 October 2001 (the 'arrest warrant') and 29
    October 2001 (the death of his brother) were not motivated by political
    opinion held by the appellant, and known to the perpetrators.  We  note
    that he did not consider whether a perceived  political  opinion  could
    have been the reason for the incidents.  Strictly, he should have  done
    because that may have been enough to establish a Convention reason.  He
    also said the  appellant  had  failed  to  establish  that  there  were
    substantial grounds for believing that there was a real  risk  to  him,
    from IMIK, in his home area.

9.   As to the PUK, the Immigration Judge also  found,  with  reasons,  that
    the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of  persecution  at  the
    hands of the PUK.  As we explain later, we do not need to go into  that
    finding.

10.  The Immigration Judge dismissed the appeal on  both  asylum  and  human
    rights grounds.

Procedural history since the second appeal
11.  The appellant applied for a review. A Senior Immigration Judge  ordered
    reconsideration  on  18  July  2005.    On  1  December   2005   Senior
    Immigration Judges Warr and Jarvis reconsidered the  determination  and
    concluded that the Immigration Judge had not made  any  error  of  law.
    They directed that the Immigration Judge's decision should stand.

12.  The appellant then applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal.  Permission  was  initially  refused  by  one  of  the   Senior
    Immigration Judges, but was later granted by Kay  LJ.    The  Court  of
    Appeal's judgment is cited as HA (Iraq) v SSHD [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1373.
    The grounds of appeal which  related  to  the  PUK  findings  were  not
    proceeded with.  The Court dealt only  with  the  appellant's  fear  of
    IMIK.  On that aspect, the appeal was allowed and  the  reconsideration
    remitted to the Tribunal.  It is that remitted hearing  which  we  deal
    with.

13.  There were initially four grounds of appeal to  the  Court  of  Appeal.
    The Court said it was mainly concerned  with  the  Immigration  Judge's
    determination.  The first ground  which  was  pursued  related  to  the
    application of Tanveer Ahmed. The Court found there was nothing in that
    ground because Tanveer Ahmed relates to the approach to documents which
    are alleged to be forgeries. It was not  suggested  that  the  document
    (the 'arrest warrant') was a forgery.  The court said that, whether the
    document was properly described  as an arrest  warrant,  in  the  sense
    that it did not have legal effect as such, was not the  point.  It  was
    arguably  an  important   corroborative   link   in   the   appellant's
    understanding that IMIK was responsible for targeting him. It was also,
    arguably, a  clear  indication  that  he  was  targeted  for  political
    reasons. The 'arrest warrant, under  the  heading  'Union  Movement  of
    Islamic Kurdistan ("IMIK")', said

         'Guilty [HO] has attacked the whole religion of  Islam  by  writing
         articles and defending his radicalist ideology.  This action in the
         Islamic religion is punishable and the punishment  must  be  death.
         Therefore, wherever you find him, arrest him and send  him  to  the
         Council of Jihad.'

14.  In his judgment, Carnwath LJ said there was nothing in the document  to
    connect it with the other two incidents,  and  the  appellant  admitted
    that his beliefs  about  those  responsible  for  those  incidents  was
    speculative. But, looked at against the background of the document,  he
    said it was relevant to consider whether the combination of the factors
    was sufficient to give rise at least to a real risk  that  it  was  the
    IMIK who were responsible for the three incidents. The  Court  accepted
    there could have been an issue about whether the document was ever sent
    to the appellant in the first place, but that was not the approach  the
    Immigration Judge took.  He appeared to accept that a  member  of  IMIK
    may have thrown the document into the appellant's house in  an  attempt
    to frighten him. He said there was a gap  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
    reasoning which was not corrected in the reconsideration  decision.  It
    was an important matter which should have been taken into account.  Not
    to do so was an error of law which required the court to intervene.  In
    paragraph 11 of his judgment, Carnwath LJ said:

         'It is common ground that, having arrived at that point, the matter
         must be remitted  to  the  IAT  for  reconsideration.   Of  course,
         establishing a link with IMIK is not enough necessarily to get  the
         claimant home.  There may still be unanswered questions  about  the
         precise status of IMIK within the KAZ, and also about the relevance
         of what happened in 2001 to events and circumstances  as  they  now
         are. But on those limited grounds I  would  allow  the  appeal  and
         direct that the matter be remitted to the AIT.'

15.  Gage LJ agreed and, although he made some  brief  observations  in  his
    judgment, they did not add to the issues discussed by Carnwath LJ.

16.  May LJ also agreed the appeal should be allowed.  He  also  said  there
    was no error of law arising from the way in which the Immigration Judge
    referred to Tanveer Ahmed.  He also said that the document,  thrown  at
    the appellant on 9 October 2001, was part of  the  evidential  material
    available to support the second ground of appeal. It  went  to  whether
    there was a real risk that the  appellant's  accepted  fear  was  well-
    founded, and for a Convention reason.  He said that, if it was found in
    the appellant's favour that the perpetrators  were  IMIK,  there  would
    then be a question, which the Immigration Judge had not  addressed,  as
    to whether IMIK were agents of state persecution.  He observed that  it
    was not open to the Immigration Judge to find that  the  appellant  had
    not established a real risk that those who had thrown the document were
    members of IMIK when the document itself said  that  it  emanated  from
    them. The fact the document had been thrown at the  appellant  was  not
    challenged.  He  observed  that  the  Immigration  Judge  accepted  the
    document might well have been thrown by IMIK  members,  and  said  that
    could be relevant in deciding who were  the  perpetrators  of  the  two
    other incidents.

Scope of reconsideration
17.  The first part of the hearing dealt  with  the  extent  of  the  issues
    which were before us.  Both parties agreed there was no need for us  to
    decide whether there had been an error of law by the Immigration Judge.
    The Court of Appeal clearly found an error of law  prior  to  remitting
    appeal for reconsideration.

18.  The parties were not agreed on whether the reconsideration  could  look
    at all the issues or only those where the Court of Appeal had expressly
    found an error.  Mr Blundell argued that issues  relating  to  the  PUK
    were not before us. Mr Briddock argued that everything was. We  started
    by looking at AH (Scope of s.103A reconsideration) Sudan  [2006]  UKAIT
    00038.   The position is no different  because  it  was  the  Court  of
    Appeal that identified the error of law, rather than the Tribunal at  a
    first stage hearing.  The  head  note  to  AH  (Sudan)  says  that  the
    reconsideration is of the appeal as a whole and is not limited  to  the
    grounds for review, or  the  grounds  upon  which  reconsideration  was
    ordered. It is however limited to the grounds of appeal to the Tribunal
    from the original decision by the respondent.   AH  (Sudan)  says  that
    directions  cannot  limit  the  issues  before  the   Tribunal   on   a
    reconsideration, but the way in which those issues are dealt  with  can
    be limited by directions.

19.  The Tribunal said:

         '24. There could, we suspect, be no clearer indications  that  what
             is before the Tribunal on reconsideration  is  not  an  appeal
             against the earlier Tribunal decision but the appeal that  was
             made by the claimant to the Tribunal in the first place. ....


         25. Is  there,  then,  any  scope  for  restricting,  or  power  to
             restrict, the reconsideration by excluding any of the  grounds
             of appeal that were previously before the  Tribunal?    Again,
             it would not be surprising to  find  that  there  is  no  such
             power.  A Tribunal substituting a decision on  the  (original)
             appeal in its reconsideration might well be expected  to  have
             to bear in mind all the grounds of appeal,  because  otherwise
             the new decision would run the risk of being  worse  than  the
             old.


         26.  ...  Decisions under Rules 31  and  32  [of  the]  Asylum  and
             Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005  and  directions
             under Rule 45 are matters of good  housekeeping.  If  (despite
             some material error of  law)  an  issue  or  matter  has  been
             properly and satisfactorily dealt with in the first  decision,
             there is no reason why further time should be spent on  it  in
             the reconsideration. Although the Tribunal  reconsidering  the
             appeal has all the grounds of appeal before it, it also has  -
             indeed it has just been considering - the  previous  decision,
             and it must be at liberty  to  adopt  those  parts  which  are
             considered as sound.  The principle perhaps goes further  than
             that. Because the  process  is  a  reconsideration,  we  would
             incline to the view that in general the Tribunal should always
             adopt those parts of a previous decision which are  not  shown
             to be unsound.'

20.  The Tribunal's decision in AH (Sudan) was considered by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in DK (Serbia) and Others [2006] EWCA Civ 1747.    At  paragraph
    22 of the judgment, Latham LJ said:

         '22. As far  as  what  has  been  called  the  second  stage  of  a
             reconsideration is concerned, the fact that it is, as  I  have
             said, conceptually a reconsideration by the  same  body  which
             made the original  decision,  carries  with  it  a  number  of
             consequences.  The most important is  that  anybody  asked  to
             reconsider a decision on the grounds of an identified error of
             law will approach his reconsideration on the  basis  that  any
             factual findings and conclusions  or  judgments  arising  from
             those findings which are unaffected by the error of  law  need
             to be revisited. It is not a rehearing:  Parliament chose  not
             to use that concept, presumably for good reasons. ...


         23.  It follows that if there is to be any challenge to the factual
             findings, or the judgments or conclusions reached on the facts
             which are unaffected by the errors of  law  that  are  by  now
             identified,  that  will  only  be  other  than  in  the   most
             exceptional cases on the basis of new evidence or new material
             as to which the usual principles as to the reception  of  such
             evidence will apply, as envisaged in Rule 32(2) of the  rules.
             It is to be noted that this rule imposes the obligation on the
             parties  to  identify  the  new  material  well   before   the
             reconsideration hearing ...'

21.  It was clear  that  the  findings  concerning  the  PUK  were  entirely
    unaffected by the error of law which was identified by the court.  That
    error of law related solely to the treatment of the evidence concerning
    fear of IMIK.  It did not touch in any way upon the separate  issue  of
    fear of the PUK.   We were therefore satisfied that not  only  need  we
    not revisit the PUK issue, it would have been wrong of us to do  so  in
    the absence of any fresh evidence about that issue.

22.  So far as fear of the IMIK is  concerned,  we  do  need  to  reconsider
    that, and we do so on the basis of the position as at the date  of  the
    hearing before us.

Evidence - the appellant
23.  The appellant did not give evidence and we recall that he was found  to
    have been a credible witness.  Mr Briddock said there  were  sufficient
    findings of  fact  about  the  appellant  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
    decision.  We should mention the difficulties with interpreting at  our
    hearing.  The Tribunal had arranged an interpreter but,  at  the  short
    adjournment, the interpreter complained of toothache and said he  could
    not carry on.  Before the short adjournment Mr Briddock said  that  the
    appellant would  like  a  replacement  interpreter  so  that  he  could
    continue to follow the proceedings. The Tribunal sought  a  replacement
    and found one who said that he could arrive by 3 pm. In  the  event  it
    was 3.30 pm.  We were told by Mr Briddock after  the  adjournment  that
    the appellant was content for the appeal to proceed for the  period  in
    the absence of an interpreter.

Evidence - Dr Fatah
24.  27. The appellant called Dr Rebwar Fatah.  His  report,  dated  22  May
    2007 was served late by the appellant's  representatives.  Although  Mr
    Blundell initially wrote to say that he  may  need  an  adjournment  in
    order to deal with it, on  the  day  he  was  content  to  proceed.  He
    produced a short supplementary bundle.   In his report, Dr  Fatah  said
    that he is a British citizen. He said that he has obtained a  BSc.,  an
    MSc., and a  PhD  (from  the  University  of  London),  and  University
    College,  London  in  physics,  solid   state   physics   and   optical
    transmissions for sensing applications  respectively.   He  listed  the
    companies for which he has  worked.   In  addition  to  his  scientific
    activity, he has worked extensively  for  the  media  during  the  last
    twenty  years.   He  works  as  a  Middle  East  specialist:   writing,
    broadcasting and as a journalist.  He claimed no political  affiliation
    and no involvement with any political organisations.  He described  his
    services as purely professional and in the realm of  education,  media,
    culture and travel.   He has held senior positions in a number of media
    outlets including being the managing director of KurdishMedia.com (from
    1998 until now). It is an internet provider  of  daily  information  on
    Middle East current affairs and culture. He  listed  his  writings.  He
    also listed a number  of  Tribunal  decisions  where  he  has  provided
    reports that were accepted (presumably omitting any where he was  not).
    He observed that some of his evidence  has  been  referred  to  in  the
    respondent's Country of Origin Information reports.   He  last  visited
    the KRG in November 2005.  He is a Kurd.  We were only  concerned  with
    those parts of the report dealing with risk to WCPI members in the KRG.
      At paragraph 222 Dr Fatah said this:

         '222. Most members of WCPI, as Mr Abdulrahman, are Kurds and  Kurds
             are condemned and persecuted by the Arabs  and  Islamic  world
             for partnering with the US/Britain led coalition to  remove  a
             Sunni Arab  government  in  Iraq,  the  government  of  Saddam
             Hussein.   Kurds  regarded  as   infidels   and   puppets   of
             imperialism (sic).


         223. The frankness and outspokeness with which the  WCPI  addressed
             such pressing issues added to its reputation as a party claims
             [sic] to be committed to  truth  and  the  greater  health  of
             Kurdish and Iraqi society in the face of  internal  corruption
             and the perceived political, social and  human  rights  abuses
             committed by the  three  main  parties  controlling  Kurdistan
             Autonomous Region.  This placed the WCPI in the position of an
             opposition the ruling Kurdish  and  Iraqi  administration  and
             ideologically at odds with the Islamic organisations, such  as
             IMIK ... and all other Islamic organisations.


         224. WCPI members have experienced direct persecution from the PUK,
             KDP and Islamic organisations, in particular IMIK.   Owing  to
             this persecution many of the WCPI members  have  fled  abroad,
             and very few have gone underground in the  KRG  and  in  Iraq.
             Many of the WCPI members are also currently  to  be  found  in
             London where  the  organisation  has  held  some  meetings  in
             greater safety than can be considered possible in Iraq  or  in
             KRG areas.   The members of the WCPI has [sic] pressurised the
             Iraqi and the Kurdish administration from their exiles.   They
             have embarrassed the administration; this in  turn  translated
             into  persecution  of  their  members  back  in  Iraq  and  in
             Kurdistan.


         225. The WCPI is a small organisation and once the PUK claimed  the
             WCPI has only fifteen members.  For such a small organisation,
             the number of causalities which is given  in  this  report  is
             very high. What is give [sic] here is not a definitive list at
             all.'

25.  That conclusion is based on earlier parts of the  report.   In  section
    2.5 'WCPI in the KRG Areas' a number of  examples  are  given.   It  is
    apparent that this  report  has  not  entirely  been  written  for  the
    appellant's benefit but is a development of earlier reports on  similar
    issues.  We do not say that in  any  way  critically  as  it  would  be
    unrealistic to expect an expert to start from the beginning  each  time
    he is asked to report on a particular topic.  However, that the  report
    is built on an earlier one is demonstrated from paragraph 24  where  it
    is said:  'Thus the WPI (Worker Communist Party of Iran) has  issued  a
    press release announcing the WPI's Congress is to be held during  18-19
    September 2004'.  The fact that this section, not a quotation,  written
    by Dr Fatah is in the  future  tense  shows  that  there  were  earlier
    versions of this report. That also accounts for the fact that  many  of
    the examples given in section 2.5 are quite old.  Some examples predate
    the KRG and refer to the separate KDP and PUK areas of  what  was  then
    the KAZ.

26.  We are concerned particularly  with  events  since  mid-2004  when  the
    Tribunal, in case AM (IWCP - Conditions in Mosul) Iraq CG [2004]  UKIAT
    00263, concluded that there was  no  sufficient  evidence  of  violence
    targeted at members of the WCPI.  At paragraph 31 of Dr Fatah's  report
    there is reference to  the  WCPI,  in  the  UK  making  claims  (on  25
    September 2006) about the  party's  activities  being  banned  and  the
    assassination of two members.  However, the assassinations were in 1998
    and the alleged ban was in 2000.   At paragraph 36 there  is  reference
    to a communication from  the WCPI in Kurdistan referring to an incident
    on 12 April 2006, when an active member was arrested and imprisoned  in
    Sulaymaniyah for distributing leaflets.   It is said that the following
    day a member of the political  bureau  of  the  WCPI  was  arrested  in
    Sulaymaniyah.  Both of these incidents were in  the  build  up  to  the
    Anfal memorial day.

27.  At paragraph 38 there is reference to WCPI members being  arrested  for
    distribution of leaflets in the four months up to May 2006.   There  is
    no mention of what happened to them or what the  leaflets  were  about.
    It is said in paragraph 39 that on  21 March  2006, at  9  pm,  a  WCPI
    member was arrested leaving an Internet caf�  and  detained  overnight.
    The 'WP Iraq' website refers  to  him  being  tortured  physically  and
    psychologically during his overnight detention. Paragraph  40,  sourced
    from  the  same  website,  gave  details  of  a  person  in  charge  of
    distributing WCPI publications being shot by an unidentified gunman but
    surviving. There is reference to the person responsible  for  the  WCPI
    Arbil office  being  arrested  in  December  2005,  twice,  by  Kurdish
    security.  It does not say what happened to him and it should be  noted
    that this tends to indicate that the WCPI have (or had) offices in  the
    KRG.  This information is said to come from  a  WCPI  communiqu�  about
    attacks on party  members  which  was  published  on  1  January  2006.
    Curiously the three  incidents  referred  to  in  that  communiqu�  all
    postdate January 2006 and it is possible that the footnotes  are  wrong
    and this was meant to be January 2007.  The other two incidents are the
    kidnapping of an activist on 21 March 2006 when  the  victim  was  held
    overnight and ill-treated, and a shooting on 23 March 2006  of  a  WCPI
    activist responsible for communications in Arbil (paragraph 43  of  the
    report). On 24 November 2005 a person was arrested for distributing the
    party  periodical,  investigated  and  released   after   three   hours
    (paragraph 44 of the report). That is sourced  to  Jamawar,  a  Kurdish
    weekly. In paragraph 45 it is said that on 25  September  2005  Kurdish
    security arrested a member of WCPI who was collecting signatures in  an
    attempt to improve public  services.   He  was  accused  of  having  no
    licence to operate and it is said  that  he  was  verbally  abused  and
    physically mistreated in detention.  On 23 June 2005 another member  of
    WCPI was arrested by security in Qala Diza distributing  leaflets,  but
    it is not said that anything adverse happened to him (also sourced from
    the WCPI).  In May 2005, according to  the  WP  Iraq  website,  a  high
    ranking member of WCPI was arrested and released after a week.   It  is
    that detention which Amnesty International report on but which makes no
    mention of the reason for the arrest, nor that he was a member  of  the
    WCPI.  (Paragraph 47 of the report).


28.  In brief evidence-in-chief, Dr Fatah was asked about the  small  bundle
    of documents produced by the respondent.  The first document was a list
    of committee members and representatives of  the  Kurdistan  Referendum
    Movement ('KRM'), an organisation which described  itself  as  'Working
    for self-determination for Kurdistan'. The UK representative  was  said
    to be Dr Rabwah Fatah, with an e-mail address.  Dr Fatah, agreeing that
    was his name and his correct e-mail address, was adamant  that  he  was
    not a member of the organisation, nor even affiliated to  it.   He  had
    become aware that his name appeared on the document  and  said  he  had
    asked to have it removed.  He had not authorised  his  name  being  put
    there.  He does not know anything about the KRM and believes it is  the
    work of an individual, who is trying to promote himself.

29.  He was then taken to an article, published on 24  April  2007,  by  the
    KRM. Dr Fatah agreed that this was written by him. He said he  had  not
    sent it to the KRM and had not authorised them to distribute it.   This
    was equally true of articles dated 13 April 2006 and 15  January  2004.
    Cross-examined about the articles, he said  he  had  written  over  two
    hundred   articles   which   he   published   on   his   own   website,
    KurdishMedia.com, and as a columnist.  He said there are more than  one
    hundred thousand links to his name on the internet, over which  he  has
    no control.

30.  Dr Fatah told us that, in 2003, Kurds gathered  two-and-a-half  million
    signatures on a petition in support of a referendum to be held  in  the
    Kurdish area, before the constitution of the KRG was written.   He  had
    been asked to take the petition to the United Nations in Geneva.  That,
    he said, was the only action he had taken in relation to anything which
    could be described as a referendum movement.  He was  asked  because  a
    personality, who  was  well  known,  was  wanted  to  deliver   to  the
    document.  His communications to the KRM webmaster, asking for his name
    to be removed, have not produced any reply. He first  became  aware  of
    his name on the KRM website six  to  seven  months  ago  when  somebody
    noticed it and told him. There is also a reference to KRM in  Wikipedia
    which he has unsuccessfully tried to remove. Some of the  other  people
    listed by KRM as representatives are prominent people  of  whom  he  is
    aware.  He said that his e-mail address, and mobile  telephone  number,
    are correctly given at the end of the article of the 24 April 2007  and
    were at the end of the article when  he  originally  wrote  it.   Those
    details appear on his website.  He puts his mobile telephone and e-mail
    details at the end of his articles because he  works  with  the  media.
    They need to be able to make contact and talk to him as an Iraqi  Kurd.



31.  Mr Blundell turned to Dr Fatah's  article,  dated  24  April  2007.  It
    starts:

         'I am lucky.  For doing what I do, my  brother  did  not  pass  his
         forty-second birthday. I did.'


    Dr Fatah explained that his brother was a freelance journalist.  He was
    arrested in 1989, by Saddam's security forces.  It was not  known  then
    what happened to him.  After the  uprising,  papers  were  found  which
    showed he had been executed in 1989.   Mr  Blundell,  noting  that  the
    article was about attempts to silence KurdishMedia.com, asked  who  the
    enemies of the website were.   Dr Fatah said it  was  Iran  and  Syria.
    They do not want information to reach their people.  He said there were
    also individuals, such as corrupt Kurdish and Iraqi people, who do  not
    want a free media in the Middle East. He said they  were  not  so  much
    enemies of his, but of free media.

32.  Dr Fatah was taken by Mr Blundell to SM and Others (Kurds -  protection
    - relocation) Iraq CG [2005] UKIAT 00111, and in  particular  paragraph
    250.  There the Tribunal considered Dr Fatah's evidence to them.   They
    said:

         '250. On the whole we consider that  Dr  Fatah's  evidence  can  be
             taken as being reliable.  We note  the  extent  to  which  his
             reports are sourced and that clearly assists.  We do, however,
             find ourselves in agreement with Mr Kovats that at times in Dr
             Fatah's evidence his commitment to the Iraqi  Kurds  gave  the
             impression of affecting his judgment. This  is  in  particular
             found in his comments at paragraphs 214 and 215 of  his  first
             report. These comments are made in the context  of  a  section
             headed "The prospect of an Iraqi election for  Kurds"  and  no
             paragraphs in that section are sourced.  In paragraphs 214  to
             215 Dr Fatah surmises that the parliament were mostly Shia and
             Shia concepts are not compatible with democracy and voting and
             they simply watch the lips of the Ayatollahs  to  give  fatwas
             and those fatwas will become decrees. He speculates  that  one
             of these fatwas could be genocide of infidel Kurds.   He  goes
             on to state that the Iraqi  parliament  through  a  democratic
             process can deprive all the rights the Kurds gained  and  that
             Kurds have no international protection.  He  states  that  the
             Kurds are back to square one;   look for an Arab  solution  to
             the Kurdish issue. He goes on to state the following  "and  we
             all know, throughout the painful  history,  what  this  means,
             genocide".


         251.  We  do  not  consider  that   this   paragraph   demonstrates
             objectivity.  It may well reflect Dr Fatah's private  concerns
             about what may happen to Kurds in Iraq, but it is not  sourced
             evidence and as such must be  taken  as  detracting  from  the
             overall view that we could otherwise come to  that  he  is  an
             objective source of information  on  the  situation  in  Iraq.
             ...'

33.  Having reminded him of that passage,  Mr  Blundell  took  Dr  Fatah  to
    passages in the article he had written, dated 15 January 2004 and which
    was published by the KRM.  Mr Blundell quoted the following passages:

         'American game  in  the  Middle  East:  "Heads  Kurds  lose;  tails
         regional powers win."

    and

         'America has been keen to meet the demands of her partners  in  the
         region but this does not seem to be extended to the Kurds  and  the
         view that Kurds can be used and then forgotten seems to linger on.'

         'Every US or British politician and official  deprives  Kurds  from
         their historic  homeland  by  terming  Kurdistan  "Northern  Iraq",
         despite the fact that almost half of it has not been part  of  Iraq
         since at least 1991'

    and

         'And still the US have even more plans to destroy  Kurdistan  as  a
         political entity'

    and

         'The US terminated the "Kurdish currency" known as the Swiss dinar,
         a fundamental pillar of the Kurdistan  political  entity.  Now  the
         same currency is used all over Iraq.   Then  the  US  proposed  the
         "political process" which would transform Iraq into a  governorates
         federation, similar to the US  federal  system.  This  filthy  plan
         sought to erase the Kurds and Kurdistan from the historical map.'

    and

         'Was this yet another chapter in the divide and  rule  policy  that
         the US and other colonial powers, such as Britain, have carried out
         in Kurdistan?'

    and

         'In the dawn of the 20th century, British Empire moulded  Kurdistan
         such that eight decades of  ethnic  cleansing  and  genocide  would
         follow.  However, in the dawn on the 21st century, Britain, with no
         empire, returns to Kurdistan as an insignificant ally  of  the  new
         superpower.  Some religious Kurds believe that the British loss  of
         their empire was  a  punishment  by  God  for  the  injustice  they
         inflicted on the Kurds. To every Kurd's surprise, Britain does  not
         return to rectify a historical mistake, but  to  instead  build  on
         it.'

34.  Dr Fatah was asked to comment on his objectivity in the light of  those
    passages, and the comments in SM.   He said that the use  of  the  word
    'genocide' came from Human Rights Watch terminology and referred to the
    chemical attack on the Kurds. He said the Kurds had been  subjected  to
    genocide and he did not think that the observations in SM were fair  to
    him in that respect.  He had been analysing the  history  of  Iraq  and
    thinks that he was correct. He observed that Iraq is not  now  in  good
    shape and it could have been better.  He described the situation as  he
    understood it.  Referring to the  expression  'this  filthy  plan',  Mr
    Blundell again questioned his objectivity, and asked whether he was fit
    to give evidence as an expert. Dr Fatah said he has opinions, but  they
    do not affect his professional work. He reminded Mr Blundell that he is
    a freelance writer.  As such his opinions can go one way or the  other,
    but his report does not reflect his personal opinions.

35.  He was taken to paragraphs 69, of  his  expert  report  where  he  said
    that:

         'Talibani, the PUK leader and current President of Iraq, is a close
         ally of Iran and has conducted contract killing for Iran before  on
         a number of known occasions'.

     It was put to him that this observation  was  entirely  unsourced.   Dr
    Fatah said that it was a reference to  the  killing  of  Communists  in
    1987. He said that seven members of the WCPI were killed in 2001, and a
    number of other Communists in the  1980s.    He  acknowledged  that  he
    should have put in a source, but said what he  was  talking  about  was
    public knowledge.  He agreed that Talibani is a Kurd and head of state.
     Dr Fatah said he is aware of opinions on all sides  and  the  fact  he
    said that shows he is objective.  Even though  Talibani  is  the  first
    Kurdish head of Iraq, he is still critical of him.

36.  Mr Blundell turned to paragraph 10 of the report where  Dr  Fatah  said
    that, in preparation for the report, he had conducted  interviews  with
    three high ranking members of the WCPI (Aso Kamal, said to be a  member
    of the WCPI politburo; Dashti Jamal, said to be a senior member of  the
    WCPI and leader of the Federation of Workers Council and Union in  Iraq
    and the Union of the Unemployed in Iraq (UUI); and Nuri Bashir, said to
    be a member of the politburo, responsible for the WCPI  outside  Iraq).
    He interviewed Aso Kamal a few months ago,  and  Jalal  and  Bashir  in
    London on 16 May 2007.  Asked how he knew them, he said that  the  WCPI
    send out a raft of publications and he just  asked  if  he  could  meet
    them. They have an office in Kings Cross.  He thought it would be  more
    helpful if he had seen high profile people.  He acknowledged  that  the
    three are politically biased but said they still have  knowledge  which
    could assist.  Had he not been honest about his  researches,  he  would
    not have given the names.  He felt we should know how he had gone about
    producing his report.  He did not know how Jalal and Bashir come to  be
    in London.  He says he did not tell them why he was interviewing  them,
    merely that he was doing research for  an  organisation.   He  said  he
    works for a number of organisations such as the Belgian government, the
    Home Office, and lawyers in Sweden, the  Netherlands,  Switzerland  and
    Austria.

37.  He was asked why, as he did not know the status of those three  in  the
    United Kingdom, and as large numbers  are  here  claiming  asylum,  the
    Tribunal should consider that their evidence should be relied upon.  Mr
    Blundell said they had vested interests.  Dr Fatah said his report  was
    not just based on the three interviews, it is forty-seven  pages  long,
    with one-hundred-and-thirty-five citations. Mr Blundell had just picked
    out three of the people that he had  spoken  to.   He  hoped  that  his
    report would be given more credit than would be the case if he had only
    spoken to the three people. He said that if you take the  KDP  and  PUK
    views, it is also necessary to get the views of the other side.

38.  Dr Fatah was taken to AM (WCPI - conditions in Mosul) Iraq,  an  appeal
    in which Dr Fatah did not give evidence.  The extract relied upon by Mr
    Blundell is:

         '31. The problem with this approach by Mr Jorro is that if he  were
             correct and WCPI were in reality to be so  disliked  by  other
             parties that its members at any level were at real risk in the
             post-Saddam era, there should be by now some clear evidence of
             it that goes beyond the jockeying  for  position  by  all  the
             political partners within the new democratic  process.   There
             is not.  There is considerable violence  being  undertaken  by
             those opposed to the democratic process, which is, as shown in
             GH, targeted at the coalition forces,  westerners,  emanations
             of the Iraqi state, and very recently at  Christian  churches.
             There is however no evidence of violence targeted  at  members
             of  the  WCPI.   We  are  in  reality  being  asked  to   make
             assumptions about what might happen in the  future,  but  that
             would be speculation and is not the  proper  function  of  the
             Adjudicator or of the Tribunal.'

39.  The case was concerned with risk to WCPI members.  Mr  Blundell,  in  a
    long question, explained to Dr Fatah that in view of the  lack  of  any
    information at the time of the promulgation of that  decision  in  mid-
    2004, this Tribunal needed to look at subsequent  material  to  see  if
    WCPI members were at risk.  He referred to page 8 of his report  where,
    at paragraphs 36-47, Dr Fatah  dealt  with  up-to-date  material  which
    would support the idea of  risk  to  the  WCPI  members.   However,  Mr
    Blundell said that in relation to paragraphs 36 and 37, 38 and 39,  the
    cited source in each case was a WCPI communiqu�.    He  said  that  was
    equally true of the sources for paragraphs 40 to 46.  In  paragraph  47
    the  source  is  Amnesty  International  but  he  noted,  the   Amnesty
    International source related to a person called  Rebwar  Arif  who  was
    said to be a  prominent  activist  with  the  WCPI  (a  member  of  its
    politburo and in charge of asylum seekers and refugee affairs  for  the
    party). Mr Blundell observed that,  at  page  B31  of  the  appellant's
    bundle (the cited Amnesty International report) there is no mention  of
    Rebwah Arif being connected with WCPI. Mr Blundell, apologising for the
    length of the question, observed that when Dr Fatah's report looks  for
    an objective basis to show risk to  WCPI  members,  the  only  evidence
    cited was from WCPI itself.   Dr Fatah was asked to comment.   He  said
    that he could have supported his assertions with other sources.   Asked
    why he did not, he said he only wanted to use one source if  he  could.
    He said that he knew that Rebwar Arif was the founder of WCPI and asked
    rhetorically whether it  was  necessary  for  him  to  go  through  and
    reference everything.

40.  Dr Fatah was asked why, when he acknowledged  that  the  evidence  from
    the three witnesses from WCPI could only carry low weight because  they
    were politically biased, only low weight should not  be  given  to  the
    WCPI documents used as his sources.  Dr Fatah said that he knew some of
    'these things' himself and that some sources were in Kurdish  and  were
    more difficult for him to refer to (he did not  say   why  they  should
    be).  He gave as an example paragraph 29 of his report.  That  referred
    to a Norwegian and Swedish delegation, which had  visited  the  KRG  in
    April 2003, and stated that since the conflict with the PUK in 2000 the
    WCPI had not had an office in Sulaymaniyah .  Dr  Fatah  said  he  knew
    that himself.  He said it was well known. It was put to him again that,
    over the last four years, the only source showing that WCPI members may
    be at risk is the WCPI itself. Dr Fatah  said  they  are  not  a  legal
    organisation and have nearly been eliminated both in the KRG, and  Iraq
    itself.   WCPI had asked the KRG authorities for a licence, but it  was
    refused.  Now they operate through different  organisations.   He  said
    their offices in Kirkuk and Baghdad had been attacked and  the  members
    disappeared. The party does not exist officially in Iraq  at  all.  (Dr
    Fatah does not appear to include the KRG when he  makes  reference   to
    Iraq.)

41.  He was asked about the current status of the group known as IMIK.    He
    said that they have been described as the 'mother of all fundamentalist
    Islamists'. He described how Mullah Krekar started  Ansar-i-Islam,  and
    which had grown from Jund-e-Islam, which in turn grew  from  splintered
    parts of IMIK.  That group has amalgamated with others.  He said it  is
    not known how Ansar-i-Islam has now become so influential.  Some  think
    that it has links with Al Qaeda.  He accepted that IMIK has become part
    of the Kurdish coalition in the last government and is a  partner  with
    the KDP and the PUK, not only in the KRG but also in Iraq  itself.   He
    was asked whether any part of his report  suggests  that  there  is  an
    objective basis for asserting that the IMIK have targeted the  WCPI  in
    the last four years.  Dr Fatah said it was difficult because WCPI  does
    not now exist as an organisation, only as  individuals  and  subgroups.
    He said they do not come to the attention of IMIK  and  other  Islamist
    organisations, they come more to the attention  of  PUK  and  the  KDP.
    That is because the WCPI does not  challenge  IMIK  any  more,  largely
    because the IMIK does not exist in the way it did in the  days  of  the
    Halabja incident.

42.  Dr Fatah was taken to an article which  had  appeared  on  the  Workers
    Liberty website. The article had been badly printed from  the  internet
    on 22 May 2007 and was missing the right hand section of the page.   It
    is no longer available.   The article was submitted by  the  appellant.
    From it, it appears that one Nadia Mahmood, said to be a member of  the
    WCPI, was in Sulaymaniyah when she spoke to one Martin Thomas. She told
    him that the party was still able to run a weekly literature stall on a
    street in Baghdad and has offices in  Baghdad,  close  to  the  Tigris.
    There is also a reference, in that article, to the many Kurds living in
    Sadr city.  Mr Blundell said that the article suggested that  the  WCPI
    does still exist in Iraq and is visible.  Asked to  comment,  Dr  Fatah
    said that the organisation is a Workers Union.  He said the  WCPI  used
    to have a base in Baghdad but it has closed.  Despite what we noted  he
    said (in paragraph 41 above) he said that it had re-established  itself
    as a different organisation, the name of which he  had  forgotten.   He
    said Baghdad is in chaos and WCPI cannot claim that they have an office
    there, or anywhere else in Iraq, now.  He did  not give any  evidential
    basis for  his assertion contradicting the appellant's own evidence  to
    the contrary.

43.  Dr Fatah was asked if he was aware of any evidence, in the  last  three
    years, that does not come from  the  WCPI,  suggesting  that  WCPI  are
    targeted by IMIK.  Dr Fatah said that the IMIK are now part of the  KRG
    administration. They have Members of Parliament in that  administration
    and can now do things through political channels.  Prior  to  that,  he
    said, it seemed that IMIK had more power on its own but they are  still
    able, for example, to  run  a  substantial  demonstration  against  the
    Danish cartoons. He said that when someone recently published a book of
    poetry, with a woman on  the  cover,  IMIK  organised  a  demonstration
    against that, in Arbil.  He said that IMIK still  flex  their  muscles,
    and push their interpretation of Islam and, if they wish, they can  now
    use official channels to do so.

44.  Dr Fatah was asked about whether the appellant could,  if  at  risk  in
    the KRG, relocate to other parts of Iraq in order to  avoid  the  IMIK.
    He said his conclusion is at paragraph  193 of his report.    There  he
    said:

         'It is not realistic to expect Kurds to relocate to Arab  parts  of
         Iraq as they would not receive sufficient protection because  Kurds
         are regarded as pro-American by Arabs'.

    It was put to him that that sentence is not attributed or sourced.   It
    was also put to him that, in an article which  he  wrote  on  13  April
    2006, he had referred to the one-and-a-half  million  Kurds  living  in
    Baghdad as an important 'string to the bow of the Kurdish influence  in
    Iraq'.  Mr Blundell referred Dr Fatah to the Workers Liberty  reference
    to the Kurds in Sadr city, and asked whether  there  are  still  mainly
    Kurdish streets in Baghdad.  Dr Fatah  said  that  one  needs  to  look
    separately at the Kurds in Baghdad, because they are most fairly  Feyli
    (Shia) Kurds. There is evidence that in the elections they mostly voted
    for Shia candidates,  and  only  twenty-five  thousand  voted  for  the
    British or Kurdish list.  He said that some sources say that they  have
    been there for hundreds of years and do not speak Kurdish.  A Kurd from
    the KRG would stick out in Baghdad.   He said it would not be realistic
    for the appellant to go to Baghdad as there are extensive  examples  of
    robbery and kidnapping. He said that only the previous  day  there  had
    been reports of seventy thousand Kurds being displaced from Mosul  into
    the KRG.  He added that, in Kirkuk, the administration makes  life  for
    Kurds difficult.

45.  In re-examination Dr Fatah  was  reminded  that  he  had  said  he  has
    personal opinions which he keeps out of his reports.   Asked  what  his
    personal view was about the WCPI, he said he believed that they were as
    dangerous  as  the  Islamic  fundamentalists  because   they   take   a
    fundamentalist view.  He has no sympathy for their  beliefs.   He  said
    that they tend to undermine everything. When he was referred  again  to
    SM he said that, although he was criticised, he believed  the  decision
    also gave him a lot of credit. He had been subjected to a  considerable
    personal attack by the respondent in that case and feels he  'got  away
    lightly'. He had answered all the questions as best he could. Asked  to
    comment on the observation that, on the whole he was reliable  but  not
    wholly objective, Dr Fatah said he had learned a great  deal  from  his
    experience in SM.  He said it had been a useful experience and  he  had
    learned how to approach things.  He said now he relies on opinion less,
    and evidence more.  He argued that he had lived in the region which  is
    now the KRG for twenty-four years and that experience was very  useful.
    He wished the court had been more flexible in its approach to  him.  He
    complained that in many cases a journalist can go  to  visit  an  area,
    stay in a five star hotel, and yet come away and give evidence which is
    accepted, whereas his evidence would be rejected.  He  also  complained
    that there had been instances when he had said something, for  example,
    to the BBC which was reported and then accepted,  but  if  he  said  it
    himself it was questioned.

46.  He said that the petition which  he  handed  over  in  Geneva  was  not
    organised by an organisation called the KRM.  It was organised by an ad
    hoc  independent  group  of  ordinary  people.   They  had  neither   a
    collective name, nor a central command and control.  Asked  to  clarify
    the situation about the IMIK and Mullah Krekau, and  who  he  is,    Dr
    Fatah said he was a Shura member of IMIK and went to extremes.   He  is
    an Afghan Arab Muslim who left the IMIK 2001.   After  he  did  so,  it
    became like a sect.  He said Mullah Aziz was the founder and  spiritual
    leader.  He is a member of Jund-al-Islam. Jund-al -Islam  was  strongly
    against the PUK. It had two villages on the Iranian  border  under  its
    control. One village was accused of supporting it and  having  beheaded
    twenty-seven PUK members.   The organisation evolved to become Ansar-e-
    Islam which means supporters of Islam.  He said it was one of the  main
    fundamentalist Islamic groups which later became  Ansar  al-Sunna.   He
    said that it may have amalgamated with other groups  and  some  suggest
    that it gets help from Al Qaeda.  It sometimes goes under the banner of
    Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.   Although Ansar al-Sunna had its  origins  in
    Kurdistan, it is now everywhere, although its leader is safely in exile
    in Finland.

The Secretary of State's submissions
47.  Mr Blundell started by saying that he was no longer suggesting that  Dr
    Fatah's objectivity was undermined by his  apparent  representation  of
    KRM. He accepted Dr Fatah's explanation that his name was there without
    his authority. But, he said we should still attach limited weight to Dr
    Fatah's evidence generally.  He reminded us  of  the  note  of  caution
    expressed in GH (Former KAZ - country  conditions  -  effect)  Iraq  CG
    [2004] UKIAT 00248, on the subject of expert evidence.    Dr Fatah  had
    not been involved in that case. The  Tribunal  said,  at  paragraph  4,
    referring to expert evidence:

         '... the weight to  be  accorded  to  such  evidence  depends  upon
         demonstrable impartiality  and  objectivity,  in  addition  to  the
         requisite expertise in the subject.  If the witness is partial,  so
         that he becomes  an  advocate  for  the  person  commissioning  his
         report, or shows a lack of objectivity in his approach to the  body
         of evidence on which he draws to form his opinions, then the weight
         to  be  given  to  his  opinion  as  an  expert  witness  will   be
         substantially diminished if not altogether  eroded.   Nevertheless,
         such testimony may remain of value on a factual basis arising  from
         the witnesses' expert knowledge even where the weight to  be  given
         to expressed opinion is so reduced or eroded.'

48.  He reminded us that the Tribunal had previously heard from Dr Fatah  in
    AM where, at paragraph 31, the Tribunal had said that they  would  have
    expected some clear evidence that members of  the  WCPI  were  at  real
    risk, if that were the case.  He also referred to the  observations  in
    SM and Others  (paragraphs 250 and 251) where the Tribunal  found  that
    although Dr Fatah's evidence was reliable on  one  level,  he  did  not
    demonstrate objectivity on another.  Mr Blundell argued that that still
    seemed to be the situation as he had demonstrated by reference  to  the
    supplementary bundle and the documents that he  had  referred  to.   He
    argued that Dr Fatah's articles showed an overriding commitment to  the
    Kurdish cause as is demonstrated by the language he used.  He said  the
    writings were not those of a man who should be giving evidence  to  the
    Tribunal as an objective and independent expert.  Even the  heading  on
    the document  written  on  15  January  2004:  'British  Empire  carved
    Kurdistan,  the  American  superpower  tries  to  dissolve  it'  is  an
    indication of, and should necessarily lead to,  greater  concerns  than
    the Tribunal had in GH.  The reference, in the body of the text, to the
    United States 'filthy plan ... to erase the Kurds  and  Kurdistan  from
    the historical map' is an illustration of polemic and of his  trenchant
    criticism of the United States and the United Kingdom and their foreign
    policies, and of the transitional administration in Iraq  as  a  whole.
    Although Dr Fatah said that he separates the  articles  he  writes  and
    distributes by e-mail, from his professional life and independence,  Mr
    Blundell argued that he vents his spleen through his  articles  and  it
    would be impossible to separate those views when they are  so  defined.
     He said that Dr Fatah was not as objective as he  should  be,  and  we
    should give very little weight to his report.

49.  Mr Blundell said that Dr Fatah was  evasive  when  asked  to  point  to
    objective material to substantiate the risk to the WCPI from IMIK.   He
    argued that both groups have splintered but two  things  are  apparent.
    First, the WCPI does still exist, or did in June 2006 as is illustrated
    by the appellant's own evidence at page B38 of the bundle. He asked  us
    to find that there is an organisation, even  if  it  is  affiliated  to
    others, which is distinct and in Iraq.  He  said  that  was  the  first
    fixed point for us to consider.

50.  He said there is also still an organisation called  IMIK  in  Iraq  and
    that is the second fixed point.  He said that, according to  Dr  Fatah,
    IMIK is part of the administration in the  KRG.  Mr  Blundell  accepted
    that was the case.  Dr Fatah said that, if there was persecuting to  be
    done, IMIK could use official channels.  But, since AM, there has  been
    no objective evidence at all to substantiate the assertions  that  WCPI
    members are at risk from IMIK.  He emphasised that he said that with no
    caveat.

51.  He referred again to the Tribunal in AM having  said  that  they  would
    have expected clear evidence of risk to members of WCPI.  Whilst  there
    may now be some evidence in Dr Fatah's report, it all postdates AM.  It
    was to be found from  paragraph  35  of  his  report  and  was  largely
    premised on information said to come from  WCPI  itself.   He  accepted
    that, in the footnotes giving the sources, there were  two  exceptions.
    One was from Jamawar, Kurdish Weekly.    It  mentions  the  KDP  having
    arrested a WCPI member, who  was  released  three  hours  later.  That,
    argued Mr Blundell, did not demonstrate persecution.  The  other  is  a
    quotation from the Amnesty International report, a copy of which is  in
    the appellant's bundle.  The report makes no reference  to  the  person
    whose arrest is mentioned by the WCPI being a member of it.  He  argued
    that whether he was, a member does  not  matter  because  there  is  no
    suggestion that he was arrested because he was a member  of  WCPI.   Mr
    Blundell argued that there is a complete lack of acceptable evidence of
    risk, although he acknowledged that there is plenty of evidence  in  Dr
    Fatah's report that WCPI is a group  that  has  been  disliked  by  all
    sides. He mentioned paragraph 51, which referred to  trouble  emanating
    from the PUK in the past.  A document called Kurdish Life, found in the
    New York-based Centre for Research of the  Kurdish  Library  in  summer
    2000, reported  WCPI  members  being  shot.   That  incident  was  also
    mentioned in 1999 Amnesty International report.  There was also mention
    of the group in April 2000 in a UNHCR report (referred to by  Dr  Fatah
    at paragraphs 70 and 71 of his report). Mr Blundell said there has been
    nothing similar to those statements in the last three or four years.

52.  He referred to Dr Fatah being asked why he saw fit to  speak  to  three
    WCPI members when he was researching his report. He reminded us that Dr
    Fatah said it would be helpful, even he  said  we  should  give  little
    weight to their opinions as they were politically biased.   Mr Blundell
    said it is not clear, if that is the line which Dr Fatah takes, why  he
    accepted  what  WCPI  said  in  the  communiqu�s  referred  to  in  his
    footnotes,  uncritically.    Mr  Blundell  said  Dr  Fatah's   research
    methodology was lacklustre. In sum, he  said,  the  report  amounts  to
    little more than saying that the WCPI are at risk because they say they
    are.  Mr Blundell relied particularly on the  appellant's  document  at
    page B38 of the appellant's bundle which shows that the WCPI  have  the
    ability to run a literature stall in Baghdad, which in turn shows  they
    are not targeted.

53.  Mr Blundell accepted that if we were to find  that  there  is  risk  to
    WCPI members, from IMIK or its successor, within  the  KRG,  then  that
    would be the case throughout the KRG.  However, he  said,  outside  the
    KRG the situation is different.  He referred to the US State Department
    Report, published on 6 March 2007, referring to events in 2006.   There
    it is said that the Constitution of Iraq provides  the  right  of  free
    movement in all parts of the country, and the right  to  travel  abroad
    and return freely.   It says 'However there were  some  limitations  in
    practice'.   We asked Mr Blundell whether that was not something of  an
    understatement, coming from that source. His response was that whatever
    limitations there are, they are  not  sufficient  to  prevent  internal
    relocation to Baghdad.  He reminded us of SM and Others, the case where
    Dr Fatah had given evidence, in which the Tribunal said (in  2005)  (in
    paragraph 279):

         'We also consider that relocation to the south for a  Kurd  can  in
         general be effected without this being  unduly  harsh  and  without
         giving rise to a real risk in all but  the  most  exceptional  high
         profile cases of their relocation being brought to the attention of
         one of the two political parties i.e. the KDP or the PUK,  of  whom
         they had a fear.'

    There is no question of fear of the PUK in this case.

54.  Mr Blundell finally looked  at  the  reach  of  the  influence  of  the
    Islamists in the KRG and in the rest of Iraq.  ECRE (page B129  of  the
    appellant's bundle), reporting in April 2007, on  Northern  Iraq  (i.e.
    the KRG) said:

         'Despite the fact that the three  northern  governorates  that  are
         controlled by the Kurdish Regional Government are safer compared to
         the rest of Iraq, there are certain groups that remain at  risk  of
         persecution, such as those who risk being suspected of belonging to
         militant Islamist groups, women who risk  honour  related  violence
         and female genital mutilation and minorities.'

    There was, said Mr Blundell, no mention of the WCPI in that list.

Appellant's submissions
55.  Mr Briddock asked  us  to  accept  Dr  Fatah  as  an  expert  on  Iraqi
    Kurdistan.  He reminded us that he had set out his expertise  in  eight
    paragraphs at the beginning of the report.  He has reported  and  given
    evidence in a number of cases; and assisted, for example,  the  Belgian
    government.  We should accept  there  are  large  areas  where  he  can
    properly be accepted as an expert.   He reminded  us  of  the  positive
    things which were said about Dr Fatah in SM, and reminded  us  that  Mr
    Blundell had concentrated on the negative aspects of what was  said  in
    that case.  We should bear in mind what Dr Fatah said about a  tendency
    to accept opinions of reporters who stay in five star  hotels,  but  to
    reject the evidence of Dr Fatah who was brought up  in  Kurdistan.   He
    said there were two matters we should bear in mind.   First,  Dr  Fatah
    clearly has strong views as to what should happen in Iraq, and about US
    and UK policy, but that does not mean his opinion as an  expert  should
    be disregarded. Second, he had told us that he did not like  the  WCPI,
    which he regards as fundamentalist and  dangerous.   Neither  of  those
    things means that he would write his report unobjectively.

56.  He also said that an expert is a witness whose professional opinion  is
    admissible.  He was there to give his opinions  and  we  should  accept
    them unless there is a reason not to. He reminded us that  the  experts
    referred to in GH did not include Dr Fatah, and that  he  is  certainly
    not an advocate for the WCPI.  He  suggested  that  it  was  a  massive
    generalisation to suggest that because the appellant is Kurdish, and Dr
    Fatah is Kurdish, that they must share the same causes and aspirations.
     He said that was far  too  simplistic.   He  argued  that  Dr  Fatah's
    evidence had not  been  evasive,  it  was  comprehensive.   There  were
    occasions when he did not answer the questions, but Mr Briddock invited
    us to look at our notes of the hearing and observe  that  some  of  the
    questions simply could not be answered directly. The  cross-examination
    had been designed to discredit him as an expert and, although  many  of
    the questions were pertinent, if Dr Fatah had not been so  well  versed
    in the situation his answers would not have been so credible.  When the
    Tribunal in SM found him  to  be  generally  reliable,  his  publishing
    activities were not hidden.  They  made  that  finding  notwithstanding
    them.

57.  Addressing  the  suggestion  that  there  is  little  or  no  objective
    evidence about members of the WCPI,  he  reminded  us  that  it  is  an
    illegal and small organisation.  It  is  therefore  difficult  to  find
    objective evidence. The smaller the  organisation,  the  less  evidence
    there will be. The question we have to answer is, are  members  of  the
    group perceived to be in opposition to the Islamlists and therefore  at
    risk?   He said there are many groups  who  are  extremely  hostile  to
    elements that they perceive as hostile to Islam.   The  events  of  the
    Danish cartoons illustrates that.  Nobody would have  believed  that  a
    cartoonist in Denmark would be at risk simply for a cartoon.  One needs
    to keep a broad mind.  The appellant's  beliefs  are  in  communism,  a
    secular society, and against the veil; all contrary to the  beliefs  of
    the Islamists.  Mr Blundell had said that there is no  truly  objective
    evidence of persecution of WCPI members.  Mr Briddock accepted all  the
    references were from the WCPI itself but, he argued, that does not mean
    they are not true. They have been published over a  period.   Both  the
    Tribunal, and the respondent, accept that the WCPI exists.   He  argued
    that it would be extraordinary if the WCPI had set out to  deceive  the
    United Kingdom authorities by  issuing  these  press  releases  over  a
    period of time.

58.  On the accepted facts, Mr  Briddock  argued,  the  appellant  has  been
    persecuted in the past. That was shown by the three incidents.  To  say
    now that there is no evidence of continuing persecution of WCPI members
    is wrong.  Dr Fatah said that he knows that it has happened.    He gave
    reasons for not citing sources other than the WCPI, including the  fact
    that some documents were in Kurdish.   He said that the  sources  given
    on pages D8 and 9, and referred to in the footnotes, relate to dates in
    2005/2006. He argued that the IMIK is still in the KRG  and  refers  to
    its metamorphosis.   He said that if we were to accept  that  Dr  Fatah
    has the expertise, and is reliable, we should put greater weight on his
    report and accept that it is difficult to give examples.   Mr  Briddock
    was not suggesting that if the appellant were to  return  he  would  be
    sought at roadblocks, but rather in his home area would  be  identified
    as an activist with [not Islamic] fundamentalist views.   As  a  result
    the risk which he fears is  well-founded,  bearing  in  mind  what  has
    happened to him in the past.  Mr  Briddock  reminded  us  that  if  the
    appellant has to relocate the respondent has accepted that he could not
    do so within the KRG.  As to the rest of Iraq,  he  argued  that  if  a
    region is in chaos, a person cannot be protected from  people  who  are
    looking for power.   He said that, although Dr Fatah's evidence  refers
    to the one-and-a-half million Kurds who are assimilated in Baghdad,  he
    also said they would not be identifiable as such because the second and
    later generations would  have  lost  their  Kurdish  accents.   On  the
    subject of  relocation  generally,  he  referred  us  to  his  skeleton
    argument.  Much of the material he referred to dealt with the situation
    in Iraq, outside the KRG.  Because we find later that there is no  real
    risk to the appellant, as a member of the WCPI, within the KRG,  we  do
    not need to deal with the question of relocation to the  rest  of  Iraq
    and have not therefore dealt with the submissions on that aspect.    We
    understand that the Tribunal will be considering  the  current  general
    situation in Iraq outside the KRG in a future  Country  Guidance  case.
    We do not  therefore  propose  to  deal  with  that  issue  here.   The
    appellant will be returned direct to the KRG and not to Baghdad.

59.  At the end of the  submissions  the  parties  agreed  that,  Convention
    reasons apart, the question of a breach of Article 3,  the  entitlement
    to humanitarian protection and recognition as a refugee, would stand or
    fall together.  Mr Blundell accepted that if the appellant is  at  real
    risk of persecution within the  KRG,  that  would  be  because  of  his
    political opinion.

60.  We asked both parties to confirm that all the documents they relied  on
    had been expressly  referred  to  either  in  submissions  or,  in  the
    appellant's case, Mr Briddock's skeleton argument.   We did not wish it
    to be suggested that there was  material  within  the  copious  bundles
    which had not been referred to but which could have furthered the cause
    of one side or the other.  As a result of that, Mr Briddock referred to
    an article dated 2 February 2005 (page B31) headed 'Plot by the Islamic
    Republic of Iran to liquidate the leadership of Workers Communist Party
    of Iraq in the city of Basra  has  been  detected'.   He  mentioned  an
    article by David Bacon (on page B22); and an article dated  18  January
    2007 from the 'Organisation of Australia - Workers Communist  Party  of
    Iraq' which was largely a criticism of the Australian  authorities  for
    protecting the editor and staff of a newspaper called the Ferat  Arabic
    Daily which had threatened Hussein Khoshnow.

61. Mr Blundell referred to the current COIS report saying that  there  had
    been little new about IMIK since 2001. On page 210 it said:


         'Founded in 1987.  Its founder and leader was Sheikh Uthman Abd al-
         Aziz.'


   On page 212 there is reference to the WCPI.  That brief reference  is  to
   the party having been founded in 1993 by Mansoor Hekmat, and having  held
   its first congress in July 2004.   The COIS reports that there is a  note
   in 'Political Parties of the World  2005'  that  the  WCPI  is  based  in
   Kurdistan and:-

         'Although the party considers Kurdish autonomy is a regression into
         non-progressive nationalism, it demands a referendum on  the  issue
         of Kurdish autonomy so that "the people of Kurdistan control  their
         own destiny".   ... In 2003 it launched ferocious  verbal  assaults
         on and arranged large demonstrations against the  US  "annihilation
         war" against Iraq.'

62.  The extract describes the WCPI as an illegal party,  in  both  the  PUK
    and KDP controlled areas. It was said  to  be  opposed  to  the  Saddam
    regime, as well the PUK and KDP administrations.   Interestingly,  that
    extract makes reference to Dr Fatah who had claimed in a  report  dated
    28 November 2005 that members of the WCPI were at risk from persecution
    in the PUK and KDP controlled areas.  It also refers to him  as  having
    said that, as most members of the WCPI are Kurds, there  was  a  strong
    possibility that they were not generally safe in the rest of  Iraq.  We
    say 'interestingly' because there was no mention of threats  from  IMIK
    or other Islamists.  The extract goes on, still using  Dr  Fatah  as  a
    source, to say that the:

         'WCPI were very critical of honour killings as well as the  Quaran.
         They also publicly condemned Islamic beliefs, replacing  them  with
         autistic  and  western  ideas,  including  freedom  of  gender  and
         equality.  This angered many Islamists.'

    There is no mention of serious risk as a result of that.   It said that
    the WCPI publish a newsletter called Iraq Weekly and that its leader is
    Rebwar Ahmad.  We were referred to paragraph 3.17  of  the  Operational
    Guidance Note issued by the  respondent  on  12  February  2007,  which
    refers to general fear of Islamic militants but is not of assistance in
    this particular case.

63.  Paragraph 6.18 of the COIR deals  with  the  political  system  in  the
    Kurdish Regional Government areas.  It said that the Kurdistan  Islamic
    Group (IMIK) came second with 4.9% of the vote and has six seats in the
    Kurdistan National Assembly.

Conclusions
64.  We base this determination on the accepted evidence  of  the  appellant
    that, in July 2001, he was attacked by two men with long beards wearing
    Islamic dress; that on 9 October 2001 a document, referred  to  by  the
    Immigration Judge as an arrest warrant purporting to  come  from  IMIK,
    was thrown into his house; and that on 29 October 2001 the  appellant's
    brother was killed by shots fired from a passing vehicle in which  were
    men with long beards and Islamic  dress.   For  the  purposes  of  this
    determination we are prepared to accept  that  those  involved  in  all
    these incidents were members of the IMIK.   We  accept  that,  although
    IMIK never had any authority to issue an arrest warrant as it would  be
    understood in this country, the  document  to  which  we  have  earlier
    referred  contained  death  threats  and  was  intended  to  at   least
    intimidate the appellant.  In view of the subsequent  shooting  of  the
    appellant's brother the document was apparently not an idle threat.

65. The task of this Tribunal is to consider whether there is a  real  risk
    to the appellant were he to return to the Kurdish Regional  Governorate
    now.  The burden of proof is upon the appellant.  It is six years since
    he was last in Iraq, and much  has  changed.   Paragraph  339K  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC395 provides:
        339K.  The  fact  that  a  person  has  already  been  subject   to
        persecution  or  serious  harm,  or  to  direct  threats  of   such
        persecution or such harm, will be regarded as a serious  indication
        of the person's well-founded fear of persecution or  real  risk  of
        suffering serious harm, unless there are good reasons  to  consider
        that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated.
66.  The first issue is how to deal with Dr  Fatah's  evidence.   We  accept
    that, in general terms, an expert who is  also  an  active  participant
    (for example as a human rights activist) can sometimes be both  capable
    and better placed to give an accurate analysis than others.  But,  that
    assumes that such a person is able to either demonstrate detachment and
    objectivity, or make transparent what his basic  assumptions  or  value
    judgments are.  (For example,  some  would  argue  that  the  US  State
    Department  reports  have  a  foreign  policy  agenda,  but  are  still
    considered to be empirically based.)  We have concluded that in general
    we agree with the approach of the Tribunal in SM.  Dr Fatah was brought
    up in the Kurdish area of Iraq.  He takes a  considerable  interest  in
    events in Iraq.  He has been in the United Kingdom since  1982  and  is
    now a British citizen.  His formal academic qualifications are science-
    based and have no bearing on his  expertise  to  report  on  Iraq.   In
    addition to his scientific activity, he is known as  a  commentator  on
    Kurdish Iraqi affairs and is called upon by  the  media  to  give  them
    assistance. He has his own website dealing with Kurdish issues  and  he
    writes  articles  which  are  published  there  and  elsewhere  on  the
    internet.  We accept  that  he  has  no  connection  with  the  Kurdish
    Referendum Movement because Mr Blundell accepted he did not.  We cannot
    help but feel  that  there  is  more  to  his  name  appearing  on  the
    movement's website than we have been told, but that is not an issue for
    this occasion.   However, the articles  which  were  published  by  the
    Kurdish Referendum Movement under his name are all acknowledged  by  Dr
    Fatah to have been written by him.  He says  there  are  a  very  large
    number of references to him on the internet including Wikipaedia and he
    has no control over them.   We  were  concerned  about  the  views  and
    attitude which Dr Fatah has expressed in some of those articles.   They
    were described by Mr Blundell in submissions as Dr  Fatah  venting  his
    spleen.  He referred to them as polemic.   They are.  The references we
    quoted earlier, including those about the  United  States,  and  United
    Kingdom's policies, the reference to a 'filthy plan'  and  the  general
    tenor of the articles are those of a political  campaigner  and  not  a
    calm and objective observer of events.

67.  Dr Fatah argued that he can  separate  his  political  views  from  his
    professional views and that, when he comes to write  a  report,  he  is
    objective.  He said that, although he interviewed three senior  members
    of WCPI, not much weight should be given to their  views  because  they
    were politically biased and not independent or objective.  It therefore
    seemed curious that he  did  not  apply  the  same  test  to  the  WCPI
    documents.  They  are  the  sources  supporting  most  of  his  opinion
    evidence about risk to WCPI members since the  Tribunal's  findings  in
    GH.  There, the Tribunal said there was little or no objective evidence
    about WCPI members  being  at  risk.   When  cross-examined  about  the
    quality of his sources about the WCPI over the last two or three years,
    Dr Fatah said that there were other sources.  He  said  he  could  have
    quoted them but did not.  That is not good enough.   If  he  wished  to
    persuade us that his evidence is sourced  or  corroborated,  elsewhere,
    then those sources need to be identified.  Similarly it is  not  enough
    for Dr Fatah to say that he also knows things to be correct.  He should
    say how or why he knows that.

68.  Dr Fatah said that the WCPI is a small group  and  therefore  there  is
    little  evidence  about  it.   Mr  Briddock  emphasised  that  in   his
    submissions.   However, it is clear from the little background evidence
    there is, that the WCPI does have a  presence,  at  least  in  Baghdad,
    where it has a literature stall.  Thus it is clear  that  the  lack  of
    background evidence about problems for  WCPI  members  does  not  arise
    solely from the fact that the organisation is very small and almost non-
    existent.

69.  Dr Fatah said he disliked the WCPI and what it stands for, and  regards
    it as a dangerously fundamentalist organisation.  Mr  Briddock  argued,
    that being the case, Dr  Fatah  would  not  lose  his  objectivity  and
    effectively campaign for a WCPI member in his report.  Whilst that  may
    be the case, it is not a particularly persuasive argument.

70.  We accept, as did  the  Tribunal  in  SM,  that  Dr  Fatah  has  useful
    information to give about Iraq, and in particular the KRG.  He was last
    there in 2005.  However, in SM it was recognised that in some respects,
    he is not an objective expert.  The Tribunal in  GH  cautioned  against
    experts  who  become  advocates  in  the  cause  of  the   person   who
    commissioned the report, or who show  a  lack  of  objectivity  in  the
    approach to the body of evidence from which opinions are drawn.

71.  Insofar as WCPI is concerned, we start from the Tribunal's view  in  AM
    that if there had been a risk to WCPI members  in  2004,  because  they
    were so disliked by other parties in the post-Saddam era,  there  would
    be some clear evidence of that.  We then observe that the only evidence
    adduced of risk arising since that date, comes from WCPI  sources.   We
    agree with Dr Fatah that the WCPI members  he  interviewed  are  people
    whose evidence should be given very little  weight,  because  they  are
    from the WCPI itself.   Exactly the same applies to  the  WCPI  sources
    quoted by Dr Fatah.  They are almost certainly advocates in  their  own
    cause.  We look for independent evidence to support what the WCPI  said
    in their communiqu�s, and there is none.  Indeed, the  little  evidence
    there is, is to the contrary in the  sense  that  there  is  background
    evidence, provided by  the  appellant,  of  WCPI  operating  freely  in
    Baghdad.  The situation is therefore effectively still the same  as  it
    was when AM was decided.  There is no satisfactory  objective  evidence
    of risk to WCPI members either from militant Islamists or anyone  else.
    We are not satisfied on the lower standard of proof  that  there  is  a
    reasonable likelihood that WCPI members are at real  risk  either  from
    militant Islamists or others within the  KRG.   There  is  insufficient
    satisfactory evidence to support the proposition, notwithstanding  that
    Dr Fatah professes to dislike WCPI.  His WCPI sources are not  reliable
    as even he, almost, admitted.

72.  The sources that have been referred to are almost entirely WCPI  based.
     For the appellant, it was suggested that the WCPI was unlikely to have
    set about distributing a series of wrong or misleading communiqu�s  and
    website entries.  We do  not  say  that  what  the  WCPI  has  said  is
    deliberately misleading or false, but we do make the  observation  that
    the WCPI is a political party and a campaigning  organisation  bent  on
    furthering its own cause.  The concept of spin, that is to say, putting
    the best possible gloss on evidence, is now well  known  and  the  WCPI
    evidence has to be looked at in that  light.   Some  of  the  incidents
    referred to were relatively insignificant and we are  led  to  question
    why they were put into  the  public  domain,  if  not  for  campaigning
    purposes.  It is particularly interesting to note that in the one  case
    where Amnesty International were used as a source, there was no mention
    of the 'victim' being a member of WCPI or, even if  he  was,  that  his
    detention was because of that membership or activities  in  support  of
    it.

73.  Taken at face value, the sources indicate a  rather  greater  level  of
    WCPI activity than Dr Fatah would have us believe.   He said  that  one
    of the reasons there is so little information about WCPI is that it  is
    illegal and almost non-existent. The sources say that there WCPI has an
    office in Arbil.  They make  reference  to  a  considerable  amount  of
    leafleting in Sulaymaniyah  and  to  a  number  of  members  and  their
    positions within the party hierarchy.  We are  not  persuaded  that  Dr
    Fatah's description of the organisation  as  almost  non-existent  fits
    comfortably with the sources which he quotes.  They  tend  to  indicate
    that the WCPI does have a presence in the KRG.

74.  We should also look at the IMIK.  Whilst some years ago  the  IMIK  was
    renowned for enforcing its views by violent means,  we  have  not  been
    referred to any recent evidence that it continues to do so.  We  accept
    that the document thrown into the appellant's house contained a serious
    threat of violence and we also accept that, in 2001, it was  reasonable
    to assume that the threat might be carried out.  However a considerable
    time has passed and IMIK has clearly changed.  It is difficult to  know
    what has happened to it but we were  shown  little  current  background
    evidence about it.  Such evidence as there is does not suggest that  it
    is active in enforcing its views in the violent way it did in the past.
     As Dr Fatah said, it can now enforce its views legitimately, at  least
    to some extent, because it  is  in  government.  Whilst  other  Islamic
    movements  may  have  grown  from  splinters  of  IMIK,  there  is   no
    satisfactory evidence about their activities and certainly  nothing  to
    suggest that they target members of the WCPI.  IMIK now have six  seats
    in the KRG Parliament.  Whilst it is generally  thought  that  militant
    Islamists in the main body of Iraq, outside the  KRG,  are  responsible
    for at least some of the violence, there is no evidence  of  a  similar
    degree of violence within the KRG.

75.  In summary, there is little or no satisfactory evidence that  the  IMIK
    are conducting themselves in  a  way  that  would  cause  a  reasonable
    likelihood of real risk to persons with whom they disagree, within  the
    KRG.  They are in government and although it has been  said  that  they
    have splintered, there is no satisfactory evidence that  other  Islamic
    groups have replaced them in such a way as to  cause  a  real  risk  to
    those with whom they disagree, and in particular WCPI members.

76.  There is no satisfactory evidence of  risk  to  members  of  the  WCPI.
    Although there is reference in Dr Fatah's report to such  difficulties,
    there is no sourced background evidence to support the assertions  made
    other than evidence from the WCPI itself which cannot  be  regarded  as
    objective. The two sources, quoted by Dr Fatah within that  section  of
    his report, which are not WCPI sources, do not support what he says. It
    may appear that in this determination we have referred to little in the
    way of background evidence.  That is not an oversight.  It is  because,
    other than the material which we have mentioned, there  is  nothing  to
    which our attention has been  drawn  which  deals  with  risk  to  WCPI
    members from Islamists, now.

77.  It therefore follows there is no satisfactory evidence that members  of
    the WCPI are at real risk from Islamists, or at all, in the KRG.   This
    determination supersedes DH (Risk -  IMIK-KAA)  Iraq  CG  [2002]  UKIAT
    05099 and makes fresh findings about IMIK.   DH  should  no  longer  be
    followed and is no longer country guidance.  No other country  guidance
    cases are affected as none dealt with the  issues  considered  by  this
    Tribunal.  SM and Others should be read in the light of  this  decision
    insofar as Dr Fatah's evidence is concerned.

78.  The Immigration Judge found that the appellant, as  a  member  of  WCPI
    was not at risk from the PUK.  That was not successfully challenged  in
    the Court of Appeal.  We have not, for that  reason,  dealt  with  risk
    from the PUK.

79.  Because there is no real risk of serious harm to the appellant  in  the
    KRG, it is not necessary for  us  to  deal  with  internal  relocation,
    whether in or out of the KRG.

80.  As to the appellant personally, we acknowledge that he was the  subject
    of persecution in the past in the KRG.  That was  in  2001,  six  years
    ago.  In the context of the recent history of Iraq that is a long time.
     Of course, we acknowledge that evidence of  past  persecution  can  be
    indicative of a real risk of future  persecution.   However,  Iraq  has
    changed considerably and that applies as much to the  Kurdish  Regional
    Governorates as it does to the rest of Iraq.  For the reasons  we  have
    given there is no satisfactory evidence that the  risks  to  which  the
    appellant was exposed in 2001 are continuing, or have existed for  some
    time.  The fact that the appellant was persecuted in the past does  not
    help him.

81. The Court of Appeal  found  that  the  Immigration  Judge  had  made  a
    material error of law in his assessment of the risk  to  the  appellant
    from IMIK.  It therefore fell upon us to reconsider that aspect of  the
    appeal.   We  have  given  the  reasons  why  we   have   limited   our
    reconsideration to that issue.   Having  reconsidered  the  appeal  the
    following decision is substituted:

         The appeal is dismissed on refugee and human rights grounds.
         The appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection.
