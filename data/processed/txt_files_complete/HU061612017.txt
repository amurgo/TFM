                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    I. Ross, promulgated on 25th June 2018, following a hearing before  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 6th June 2018.  In the determination, the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Saudi Arabia, and was born on  26th  July
    1990, and is a female.   She  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent refusing her application for entry clearance  as  a  partner
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the UK.

 3. The application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on  7th  May
    2017 in relation to the financial requirement of Appendix  FM,  because
    the Appellant relied on capital in the form of savings, rather than  on
    the income of her Sponsor's husband.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed that the evidence consisted of  a  letter  from  the
    Riyadh Bank showing a balance of �41,000,  but  the  requirement  of  a
    capital required under Appendix FM had to be one that could be shown to
    be in an account for six months, and this was  not  done,  and  so  the
    application was refused.

 5. The judge observed how the Grounds of Appeal stated that the  Appellant
    had a letter from the Riyadh Bank, that she also had  an  account  with
    the Albilad Bank, the statement for which was not  submitted  with  the
    application.  Her argument was that the combination of the  amounts  in
    both different bank accounts exceeded the capital threshold requirement
    of �62,500 that she would have to demonstrate.

 6. The judge observed how the ECM maintained  the  refusal  on  the  basis
    that, whilst it was accepted by the ECM that the combined total of  the
    two  bank  accounts  exceeded  the  threshold  requirement,  "still  no
    evidence was provided that the level of savings had been maintained for
    a period of six months before the date of the application  as  required
    under Appendix FM" (paragraph 5 of the determination).

 7. The judge, however, went on to say  that  "no  further  information  in
    support of the appeal has been  provided"  (paragraph  6).   The  judge
    refused the appeal.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that contrary to what  the  judge  had
    stated at paragraphs 5 to 7 of the decision, the fact  was  that  there
    had been much documentation submitted with the  application  which  the
    judge had not referred to.  The documents are set out in the grounds of
    application.

 9. On 3rd October 2018 permission  to  appeal  was  granted,  and  it  was
    observed that the judge's decision:-

         "is only a few paragraphs long.  It  appears  that  the  Appellants
         (sic) documentary evidence was not before him.  If so she  has  not
         had a fair hearing.  The Appellant lists  the  documents  that  she
         said had been provided but not considered.  The few  paragraphs  in
         the decision barely engage with the issues and  evidence  that  was
         provided.  It is arguable that there have been  procedural  errors,
         if evidence was not before the judge, leading to an unfair result".

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 17th May 2019, the  Appellant  was  not  in
    attendance, as she  was  in  Saudi  Arabia,  but  there  was  no  legal
    representation either on her behalf.  The Respondent was represented by
    Mr C Williams, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.   He  submitted
    that this application as a partner for  entry  clearance  was  properly
    refused, for the  reasons  that  were  given  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager, namely, that, although there were two combined bank  accounts,
    which showed that the Appellant had the equivalent of some �83,000 (see
    page 26 of the Appellant's bundle  and  the  ECO's  review),  the  fact
    remained that it was not the case that the Appellant had been  able  to
    show that these funds had been held for six months, as required by  the
    Rules.

11. Accordingly, even now much other documentation that  she  had  supplied
    had not been considered by the judge, the inevitable result would  have
    been that the judge was bound to have refused it in any event.

12. As there was no representation on behalf of the Appellant, I had proper
    regard to the detailed grounds  of  application  from  the  Appellant's
    point of view.

No Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007), such that I should set aside the decision.  My reasons  are
    as follows.  I note that there is a humanitarian basis to this  appeal,
    in that the Appellant states in the grounds of application that she has
    sought to escalate the process of the appeal being heard, by contacting
    the Birmingham MP as well.

14. This is because her child was born with a congenital  disorder  of  the
    urethra, so that it was essential for her to get a visa to come to  the
    UK and to have the child undertake surgery at the Birmingham Children's
    Hospital.  However, the fact remains that the Appellant has  not  dealt
    with the core issue which the judge does expressly focus on.

15. This is that even though there are two bank accounts  which  bring  the
    total capital amount to what had originally been conceived by the Entry
    Clearance Officer, the  fact  remains  that,  as  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager pointed out,  although  the  two  bank  accounts  exceeded  the
    threshold requirement there was "still no evidence  provided  that  the
    level of savings had been maintained for a period of six months  before
    the date of application" (paragraph 5).

16. Nowhere in the documentation has that issue been addressed.  Given that
    this is the case, the Appellant would not have succeeded.

17. Accordingly there is no error of law.

Notice of Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  The decision shall stand.

19. No anonymity order is made.
