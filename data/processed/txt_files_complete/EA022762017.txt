For the Appellant:     Mr Khan
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Zahid Farooq, was born on 25 January 1985 and is a  male
    citizen of Pakistan.   By  a  decision  dated  20  February  2017,  the
    Secretary of State refused the appellant's application for a  permanent
    residence card on the basis of retained rights of  residence  following
    his divorce from his former partner, an EEA  national.   The  appellant
    appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Khawar),  which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on  2  March  2018,  dismissed  the  appeal.   The
    appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant's application  to  the  respondent  was  made  under  the
    provisions of the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016, paragraph 15:

         15.- (1) The following persons acquire the right to reside  in  the
             United Kingdom permanently-

                  (a)  an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom
                  in accordance with  these  Regulations  for  a  continuous
                  period of five years;

                  (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not an  EEA
                  national but who has resided in the  United  Kingdom  with
                  the EEA national in accordance with these Regulations  for
                  a continuous period of five years;

                  (c)  a worker  or  self-employed  person  who  has  ceased
                  activity;

                  (d)  the family member of a worker or self-employed person
                  who has ceased activity, provided-

                      (i)  the person was the family member of  the  worker
                      or self-employed person at the point  the  worker  or
                      self-employed person ceased activity; and

                      (ii) at that point, the family member enjoyed a right
                      to reside on the basis of being the family member  of
                      that worker or self-employed person;

                  (e)  a person who was the family member  of  a  worker  or
                  self-employed person where-

                      (i)  the worker or self-employed person has died;

                      (ii) the family member resided  with  the  worker  or
                      self-employed person immediately  before  the  death;
                      and

                      (iii)     the  worker  or  self-employed  person  had
                      resided continuously in the  United  Kingdom  for  at
                      least two years immediately before dying or the death
                      was  the  result  of  an  accident  at  work  or   an
                      occupational disease;

                  (f)  a person who-

                      (i)  has resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance
                      with these Regulations for  a  continuous  period  of
                      five years; and

                      (ii) was, at the end of the period, a  family  member
                      who has retained the right of residence.

             (2)  Residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  result  of  a
             derivative right to reside does not constitute  residence  for
             the purpose of this regulation.

             (3)  The right of permanent residence under this regulation is
             lost through absence from the  United  Kingdom  for  a  period
             exceeding two years.

             (4)  A person who satisfies the criteria in this regulation is
             not entitled to a right to permanent residence in  the  United
             Kingdom where the Secretary of State or an immigration officer
             has made a decision under regulation 23(6)(b),  24(1),  25(1),
             26(3) or 31(1), or an order under regulation 23(5)  (exclusion
             order) or 32(3) (deportation order), unless that  decision  or
             order, as the case may be, is set aside, revoked or  otherwise
             no longer has effect.

 3. At the hearing before  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  5  November  2018,  Mr
    Diwnycz, who appeared for the Secretary of  State,  accepted  that  the
    judge incorrectly applied the provisions of paragraph  15(1)(a)  rather
    than the provisions concerning retained rights of residence  (paragraph
    15(1)(f)).  I note in passing that  the  judge  has  applied  the  2006
    Regulations rather than the correct  2016  Regulations.   Further,  the
    judge has sought  to  identify  whether  his  former  spouse  had  been
    exercising treaty rights for a period of 5 years prior to the  date  of
    application; the judge need only have considered whether the  appellant
    was a family member who at the end of  the  5  year  period  enjoyed  a
    retained right of residence.  In his conclusion at [20],  Judge  Khawar
    wrote:

         "Therefore, on the above documentary evidence I  am  not  satisfied
         the appellant established that his  former  spouse  was  exercising
         Treaty Rights for a continuous five year period because she clearly
         was not doing so.  In addition, there was no evidence that she  was
         actually in employment at the date of the decree absolute."

 4. The decree absolute is dated 16 August 2016.  The couple married on  27
    May 2011.  The Secretary of State appears to have been  unclear  as  to
    whether he had before him a decree nisi or a  decree  absolute  but  it
    appears that the same document was before the Secretary  of  State  and
    that is categorially a decree absolute.  Judge Khawar's  conclusion  at
    [20] arguably addresses the test under paragraph 15(1)(a) and  that  in
    respect of retained residence.  The parties now agree that what had  to
    be proved by the appellant was that his former  spouse  was  exercising
    treaty rights on 16 August 2016.  Notwithstanding the "belt and braces"
    approach adopted by Judge Khawar, I am not satisfied that the judge has
    focused upon the correct test.  I cannot be sure  that  the  judge  has
    separated the two tests; much of his analysis  focuses  on  periods  of
    time during which it was not necessary for the appellant to  show  that
    his former wife was exercising  treaty  rights.   On  account  of  that
    uncertainty, I have set aside the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  and
    remade the decision.

 5. Mr Khan drew my attention to a number of items of documentary  evidence
    which, he submitted, showed that the former wife was exercising  treaty
    rights as at 16 August 2016.  At page 45 of the bundle there is an HMRC
    tax calculation summary for the tax year 2016/17 (the tax year in which
    16 August 2016  falls).   This  shows  that  the  former  wife  of  the
    appellant was self-employed during that tax year and earnt ï¿½7,039.  She
    did not pay any income tax but did pay National Insurance.  Mr  Diwnycz
    did not seek to persuade me that this evidence fails to establish  that
    the former wife of the appellant was exercising treaty rights as a self-
    employed person.  Clearly, the sums shown in the  tax  calculation  may
    have been generated by the former wife's business prior  to  16  August
    2016 and that she may have not been  operating  her  business  actively
    earning money on that date.  However, I am satisfied that the appellant
    has shown that it is more  likely  than  not  that  his  former  wife's
    business was in operation and that she was exercising treaty rights  at
    the material date.  Given that both parties accept that  the  appellant
    himself has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of at
    least 5 years, it follows that  he  has  established  a  right  to  the
    permanent residence card by virtue of retained rights of residence.

Notice of Decision

 6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  which  was  promulgated  on  2
    March 2018 is set aside.  None of the findings of fact shall stand.   I
    remake the decision.  The appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State dated 20 February 2017 is allowed.

 7. No anonymity direction is made.
