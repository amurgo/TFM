Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Razzaq-Siddiq of Counsel instructed by Universal
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant entered the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) student
    on August 26, 2009 with leave to remain until January 1, 2012. When his
    leave expired the appellant remained in the United Kingdom and was
    encountered working illegally on June 10, 2015 and served with
    paperwork as an overstayer. On April 26, 2018 the appellant claimed
    asylum.


 2. The respondent refused his application under paragraphs 336 and 339F HC
    395 on October 9, 2018. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on
    October 19, 2018 under section 82 (1) Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The appellant's appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Jones QC on November 19, 2018 and in a decision promulgated on November
    29, 2018 the Judge dismissed his appeal.

 4. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on December 12, 2018 arguing the
    Judge had failed to give adequate or proper reasons  for  refusing  the
    appellant's appeal and had incorrectly assessed the evidence raised  by
    the appellant in his evidence. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Buchanan on the basis that  the  Judge
    failed to give reasons for concluding that this was an  "old  fashioned
    punch-up" which was not necessarily motivated  by  differing  political
    views.

 5. No anonymity direction is made.

    The Submissions

 6. Mr Razzaq-Siddiq submitted that  the  Judge  had  materially  heard  in
    finding that the dispute involving the appellant  amounted  to  an  old
    fashioned and treatment between gangs. He highlighted pages 23  and  24
    of the CPIN January 2018 which  evidenced  political  violence  between
    2012 and 2017 and  submitted  that  if  returned  the  appellant  faced
    detention, false  imprisonment  and  possible  death.  He  adopted  the
    grounds of permission which had been granted.

 7. Mr Avery opposed the application and submitted that the Judge had given
    adequate reasons for his conclusions. The Judge was  entitled  to  find
    that this was simply a fight and he had gone on to give his reasons for
    disbelieving the appellant. The material relied on in the CPIN  had  no
    relevance to what happened in 2006 as the political situation  in  2006
    was fundamentally different to the situation after 2012.

 8. Mr Razzaq-Siddiq reiterated that if the dispute had been as a result of
    political violence then the outcome could have been  different  despite
    the appellant's poor immigration history.

 9. I reserved my decision.

    Findings

10. Permission to appeal had  been  granted  because  it  was  said  to  be
    arguable that the Judge's finding in paragraph 34 of his  decision  was
    flawed because the Judge did not explain the source of evidence  giving
    rise to his judgement on the similarity between old-fashioned  punch-up
    in the street in the United Kingdom and the claim made by the appellant
    about politically motivated clashes in Bangladesh.

11. During oral submissions from the  representatives,  I  raised  with  Mr
    Razzaq-Siddiq the fact that the country evidence he  was  directing  my
    attention to had no relevance  to  the  appellant's  case  because  the
    incident he complained about occurred in 2006. I also pointed out  that
    this was not simply a case that the Judge concluded it was akin  to  an
    old-fashioned street fight as the decision demonstrated engagement with
    the evidence.

12. At paragraph 34 of his decision, the Judge made a number  of  findings.
    In assessing credibility he  attached  weight  to  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had been here unlawfully since January 2012 during which time
    he had worked illegally. The Judge noted that  he  had  used  a  forged
    document to remain and work here  and  when  he  was  detained  by  the
    authorities in June 2015 did not make any claim for asylum.  The  Judge
    went on to consider his evidence and he did not accept the truthfulness
    of the allegation.

13. The appellant was found to be a  witness  who  lacked  credibility  and
    having rejected his claim the Judge thereafter went on to give  reasons
    why the rest of his claim was rejected.

14. This was a decision in which the Judge made findings that were open  to
    him and supported those findings with reasons.  There  is  no  material
    error in law.

    Notice of Decision

I uphold the decision and I dismiss the appeal.
