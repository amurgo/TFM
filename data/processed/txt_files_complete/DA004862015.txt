                         DECISION AND REASONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge N  J
     Osborne, promulgated on 27 January  2016,  in  which  he  allowed  the
     respondent's appeal against a decision to deport him.



                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016





     Background


  2. The respondent, originally a Croatian national, last  arrived  in  the
     United Kingdom during 1996. He was issued a residence card  in  August
     1999, following his marriage to an  EEA  national.  A  further  5-year
     residence card was issued on 16 February 2005. The appellant  acquired
     Italian citizenship and was issued with  an  Italian  passport  during
     October 2006.

  3. Following a conviction for affray and possessing an offensive  weapon,
     the respondent was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. There had also
     been a number of previous convictions, which did  not  result  in  the
     respondent's imprisonment.

  4. In deciding to deport the respondent, the Secretary of State  accepted
     that permanent residence had been acquired but not that the respondent
     had been continuously resident for a 10-year period.  With  regard  to
     the assessment of the threat said  to  be  posed  by  the  respondent,
     reliance was placed on an OASYS assessment, which  concluded  that  he
     posed a medium risk of harm to the public. Reference was also made  to
     the respondent's offending history, the link with alcohol misuse and a
     lack of  evidence  to  show  that  he  had  adequately  addressed  his
     offending behavior. Consequently, the Secretary of State  was  of  the
     view that there remained a risk of re-offending and a risk of harm  to
     the public. The Secretary of State accepted that  the  respondent  had
     settled into and integrated into United Kingdom society, but not to  a
     degree sufficient as to render his  deportation  disproportionate.  In
     terms  of  rehabilitation,  it  was  noted  that  the  respondent  had
     undertaken a relevant programme and engaged  with  the  Turning  Point
     charity.

  5. Article 8 ECHR was considered by the Secretary of  State  outside  the
     Rules, however it was not accepted that the respondent had  a  genuine
     and subsisting relationship with his children or that  it  was  unduly
     harsh for the children to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  while  the
     respondent  was  deported.  There  were  said  to  be  no  exceptional
     circumstances as the respondent's  mental  health  concerns  could  be
     treated in Croatia.

     The hearing before the First Tier Tribunal Judge


  6. The First Tier Tribunal Judge heard  an  application  to  adjourn  the
     appeal in order to enable the respondent to seek and obtain  treatment
     for  his   "well-established"   mental   health   difficulties.   That
     application was withdrawn owing to the judge's view  that  the  matter
     could proceed with only brief evidence from the respondent. The  judge
     heard oral evidence from the respondent and his wife which he accepted
     as  credible  and  concluded  that  the  respondent  had  been  living
     continuously in the United Kingdom from May 1997 until the date of the
     hearing and was therefore entitled to the highest level of  protection
     under the Regulations. The First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  accepted  the
     presenting officer's concession that the offences in question did  not
     reach the threshold  of  seriousness  for  deportation  on  imperative
     grounds and concluded that the residence issue  was  determinative  of
     the appeal both under the Regulations and Article 8 ECHR.







      Error of law


    7. There were two grounds of application. The first was that  the  judge
       had erred in his approach to the issue  of  continuous  residence  in
       view of the judgment in Warsame v SSHD [2016] EWCA  Civ  16.  It  was
       argued that the First Tier Tribunal Judge had taken  "any"  10-  year
       period as his starting point rather than calculating the period  back
       from the decision in question. It was said  that,  following  Warsame
       the judge failed to consider the level of integration achieved by the
       respondent in the 10 years prior to his imprisonment,  including  his
       history of offending. In this, reference was  made  to  the  Advocate
       General's opinion in Onuekwere v SSHD [2013] EUECJ C-378/12.  It  was
       said that the First Tier Tribunal Judge implied that  the  respondent
       constituted a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat,  as
       there would have been no material need  to  consider  the  length  of
       residence if Regulation 21(5)(c)  was  not  met.  The  second  ground
       briefly commented on the judge's failure to apply sections 117B and C
       of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).

    8. Designated Judge Peart granted permission on the basis sought.


    9. The respondent's Rule 24 reply of 8 March  2016  indicated  that  the
       application was opposed, that  the  FTTJ  had  considered  the  total
       period of the respondent's continuous presence in the United  Kingdom
       and not just the  period  between  1997  and  2007.  With  regard  to
       Warsame, it was noted that this judgment was dated after the decision
       in the instant case was promulgated. Nevertheless, it was argued that
       the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  considered  factors  relevant   to
       integration as well as the respondent's  offending  history.  It  was
       disputed  that  the  judge  had  found,  by  implication,  that   the
       respondent constituted a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious
       threat. With regard to the second ground, it was said that the  judge
       did not need to address the last two stages  in  R  (Razgar)  v  SSHD
       [2004] UKHL 27, as he had allowed the appeal under the Regulations.



 The hearing



 10. Ms Fijiwala clarified that it was not disputed that the respondent had
     been residing in the United Kingdom continuously since  1997,  however
     the Secretary of State's argument was that the judge had not  made  it
     clear that the respondent's links to the United Kingdom had  not  been
     broken by his period of imprisonment.  She argued that there had  been
     no overall assessment of the  respondent's  circumstances  other  than
     that his relationship with his wife had been taken into account.  With
     reference to headnote  3  of  MG  (prison-Article  28(3)  of  Citizens
     Directive) Portugal [2014] UKUT 392 (IAC), Ms Fijiwala said  that  the
     judge failed to take  account  of  past  convictions  in  relation  to
     breaking integration links. In relation  to  the  second  ground,  she
     accepted that this was dependent on the first ground.







 11. For his part Mr Sellwood reiterated what was stated  in  the  Rule  24
     response and drew our attention  to  various  parts  of  the  decision
     where, he argued, the judge had considered various factors relating to
     integration. He commented that there had been reference in the grounds
     to Onuekwere,  however  this  was  not  an  authority  to  support  an
     assertion that previous convictions  broke  continuity  of  residence,
     particularly where there had been no previous imprisonment as in  this
     case.

 12. With regard to ground two, Mr  Sellwood  stated  that  the  judge  was
     plainly entitled to halt his Article  8  consideration  at  the  third
     stage as he had allowed the appeal under the Regulations.

 13. In reply, Ms Fijiwala emphasised that the First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge
     had not asked the correct question, that is, whether the  respondent's
     integration links had been broken. He had only addressed the length of
     residence. She argued that  the  judge  had  not  taken  into  account
     relevant factors such as that the respondent was  now  separated  from
     his wife and that he had been convicted of soliciting  services  as  a
     taxi driver. She added that the judge ought to have taken evidence  as
     to the details of the relationship with his daughters.  When  referred
     by the panel to the detailed witness statements of the respondent  and
     his wife, which were before the judge, Ms Fijiwala did not pursue this
     line of argument further.

 14. At the end of the hearing, and after brief  discussion,  we  indicated
     that we were content that the decision did not  contain  any  material
     errors of law and we would, therefore, be dismissing the appeal.

Error of Law


 15. The decision in Warsame was not available to the judge at the time  of
     writing his decision and reasons and therefore it is unsurprising that
     he made no reference to it. The case of MG was, however, available and
     we have been guided by what was said by the Upper Tribunal,  following
     the European Court of Justices' preliminary ruling in the  same  case.
     As indicated by Ms Fijiwala, the following extract from  the  headnote
     is relevant

                 "(3) The judgment should be understood as  meaning  that  a
                 period of imprisonment       during those 10 years does not
                 necessarily prevent a person from qualifying  for  enhanced
                 protection  if  that  person  is  sufficiently  integrated.
                 However, according  to  the  same  judgment,  a  period  of
                 imprisonment must have a  negative  impact  in  so  far  as
                 establishing integration is concerned."

 16. The judge found that the respondent  was  sufficiently  integrated  at
     [25] of his decision where he  said  as  follows;  "I  find  that  the
     (respondent) is integrated in the  UK  and  that  he  has  obtained  a
     protected right of residence and that he has been resident in  the  UK
     for more than ten years  before  the  deportation  decision."   It  is
     abundantly clear from the three,  separate,  aforementioned  findings,
     that the judge did not merely calculate the length of the respondent's
     residence but separately considered the level of his integration prior
     to  finding  that  he  had  obtained  enhanced  protection  under  the
     Regulations.



 17. The judge carried out an overall assessment  as  to  the  respondent's
     level of integration prior to reaching his conclusion.  The factors he
     considered included, at [24], the total  length  of  the  respondent's
     residence in the United Kingdom, which at the time of the hearing  was
     a period of eighteen years. At [18] of the decision, he discusses  the
     respondent's marriage to his wife. While there is no  express  mention
     of the fact that the couple were separated, this evidence  was  before
     the judge in the form of highly detailed witness statements from  both
     the respondent and his wife.

 18. Also relevant to the issues of integration were the respondent's  many
     years of employment in the United Kingdom  as  well  as  his  previous
     studies, mentioned at [19]  of  the  decision.   At  [25],  the  judge
     explores the respondent's relationships  with  his  children  in  some
     detail and concludes that he has an active parental relationship  with
     his eldest daughter but not with his youngest daughter.

 19. It was argued on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State  that  the  judge
     failed to consider the respondent's  criminal  convictions,  including
     those, which preceded the index offence but which did  not  result  in
     him serving custodial sentences. This is not the case.  At  [23],  the
     judge considers each and every one of these matters  and  at  [23]  he
     assesses the seriousness of that offending. At [2] the judge sets  out
     the detail of the index offence under the heading "Substantive  issues
     under Appeal." Additionally, at [26] the  full  circumstances  of  the
     index offence are considered in the context  of  the  remarks  of  the
     sentencing judge.

 20. The judge heard arguments from the presenting officer, which  included
     reliance on the reasons for the decision in question provided  in  the
     refusal letter; indeed he says as much at  [10-11]  of  the  decision.
     Consequently, we find that the judge was aware that  the  respondent's
     offending would have a negative impact on the degree to which he could
     be said to be integrated, given that this is part of the Secretary  of
     State's  case  which  he  has  confirmed  that  he  has   taken   into
     consideration. Ultimately, the judge did not agree with the  Secretary
     of State's view that the respondent's offending meant that he was  not
     sufficiently integrated in the United Kingdom.  We  find  that  was  a
     conclusion he was entitled to reach.

 21. As we found no material error of law in relation to the  first  ground
     of appeal, it follows that the judge did not err in  his  decision  to
     end his Razgar consideration at stage three.

 22. The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.

 23.  No anonymity direction was made by the First Tier Tribunal Judge  and
     we see no reason to make one now.  This decision is the decision of us
     both.






















Conclusions


     The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
     the making of an error on a point of law.

     The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.
