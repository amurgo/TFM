Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr K Kumar, Kumar Legal Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines and her date of birth  is
    10 May 1978.

2.   The appellant entered the UK on 13 July  2008  as  a  student.   On  17
    February 2012 she was granted limited leave to remain until 22 December
    2013.  On 18 November 2013 she made an application to vary her leave to
    remain in the UK on the basis of her relationship with her partner, now
    husband, Mr  Ramess  Seeballuck.       The  appellant's  husband  is  a
    British citizen and his date of birth is 16 June 1945.  The  respondent
    refused the appellant's application in a decision of 16 January 2014.

3.   It was accepted by the decision maker that the appellant has a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship and that relocation may cause a  degree  of
    hardship for her husband; however, it was not accepted that there would
    be insurmountable obstacles preventing the appellant  and  her  husband
    having a family life together in the Philippines.  The  decision  maker
    considered that there were no exceptional circumstances  in  this  case
    which would warrant the grant of leave outside the Rules.

4.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and her appeal was  dismissed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Rowlands in  a  decision  which  was  promulgated  on  20  August  2014
    following a hearing on 24 July 2014.  The appeal was dismissed pursuant
    to the Immigration Rules and under Article 8 outside of the Rules.  The
    appellant was granted permission to appeal against the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal in a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy of
    9 October 2014.  Thus the matter came before me.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

5.   Judge Rowlands made the following findings:-

       "18.   Factually I am satisfied that despite what her husband said at
             the hearing it is a genuine and subsisting marriage.   Clearly
             he wanted to try and persuade both the respondent  and  myself
             that removal of her would be an end to their relationship  but
             I don't think that is necessarily the case.  The  evidence  is
             clear that they have been together for a substantial period of
             time and  that  she  has  stuck  by  him  notwithstanding  his
             illnesses.  I am satisfied therefore that there is  a  genuine
             and subsisting relationship between them.  It seems to be that
             the one and only issue is whether or not removal of her  would
             be an unlawful interference with her and his right  to  family
             life.


       19.    The appellant argues that the respondent's decision under  the
             Immigration Rules is wrong because it was  wrong  to  consider
             whether the requirement of paragraph EX.1 apply.  I cannot see
             how that argument can be because Appendix FM R-LTRP1.1  states
             that an applicant must not  fall  for  refusal  under  various
             sections and that  paragraph  EX.1  applies.   Paragraph  EX.1
             applies only where an applicant has children in the  UK  which
             clearly  this  appellant  does  not   or   where   there   are
             insurmountable obstacles preventing her and her  husband  from
             continuing their relationship in the Philippines.  Clearly the
             respondent  considers  that  there   are   no   insurmountable
             obstacles and for that reason paragraph EX.1 applies.


       20.    So far as that particular issue  is  concerned  I  agree  that
             there are no insurmountable obstacles.  The appellant and  her
             husband are a wealthy couple and there is no reason to believe
             that their income  of  about  �70,000  a  year  would  not  be
             maintained  if  they  were  to  have  to   relocate   to   the
             Philippines.  I am certain that an income of  �70,000  a  year
             for a retired couple in the Philippines would mean  that  they
             would live perfectly adequately and there is no evidence  that
             any of the prescribed drugs that the appellant's husband is in
             receipt of would not be readily available in the  Philippines.
             His health does not prevent him from relocating with  her  and
             clearly there is no  basis  for  saying  that  paragraph  EX.1
             applies.


       21.    The respondent then went on to consider the issue  of  whether
             the refusal of the appellant's claim amounted to a breach of a
             right to a private life under the Immigration Rules.  This  is
             not  specifically  covered  by   paragraph   276ADE   of   the
             Immigration Rules which outlines  the  requirements.   Of  the
             requirements the respondent could only argue that she  fulfils
             sub-Section (iv) which applies to applicants who are 18  years
             or above and have lived continuously in the UK for  less  than
             twenty years and who have no ties (including social,  cultural
             or family to the country to which she  would  have  to  go  if
             required to leave the United Kingdom).  On the appellant's own
             admission her parents and  two  siblings  still  live  in  the
             Philippines and it is not that long since she came here.   She
             clearly does  have  ties  with  her  home  country  and  could
             therefore not fulfil any of the Rules in relation  to  private
             life.


       22.    I have then considered the case of Gulshan [2013]  UKUT  00640
             which states that 'only if there were  arguably  good  grounds
             for  granting  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules  was  it
             necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider  whether
             there   were   compelling   circumstances   not   sufficiently
             recognised under the Rules.'


       23.     Paragraph  3.2.8  of   the   guidance   covers   'exceptional
             circumstances,'  where  an  applicant  does   not   meet   the
             requirements of the Rules under Appendix FM.  If  it  is  that
             that the case refusal of the  application  would  normally  be
             appropriate, but leave can be granted  outside  the  Rules  if
             exceptional circumstances apply.  The guidance continues  that
             exceptional circumstances does not mean unusual or unique  but
             that it means circumstances in which refusal would  result  in
             unjustifiably harsh consequences for  the  individual  or  the
             family such that refusal  of  the  application  would  not  be
             proportionate.  It further goes  on  to  point  out  that  the
             circumstances around the applicant's entry to the UK  and  the
             proportion of the time that they have been in the  UK  legally
             as  opposed  to  illegally  and  whether  they  formed   their
             relationship with their partner at a time  when  they  had  no
             immigration status or this was  precarious  then  family  life
             which involves the applicant putting down roots in the  UK  in
             the full  knowledge  that  their  stay  here  is  unlawful  or
             precarious should be given less weight when  balanced  against
             the factors weighing in favour of removal than the family life
             formed by a person lawfully present in the UK.


       24.    Having considered all of this and bearing in mind  the  public
             policy of requiring a person to apply  under  the  Immigration
             Rules from abroad then I am satisfied that in this case  there
             are no exceptional circumstances.  It may  well  be  that  the
             appellant would fulfil the Immigration Rules but I can see  no
             reason  why  she  should  not  be  made  to  go  back  to  the
             Philippines in order to come back to the  United  Kingdom.   I
             can equally see no reason why her husband could  not  go  back
             with her whilst those applications are pending.  The  decision
             is perfectly correct and proportionate."

The Grounds Seeking Leave to Appeal and Oral Submissions

6.   The grounds seeking leave  to  appeal  argue  that  the  Judge  made  a
    mistake.  The sponsor's annual income is �17,000 not �70,000.   He  has
    been living in the UK for more than 45 years and  he  sees  his  family
    here every week.  The Judge did not  consider  the  harsh  consequences
    should he have to go to the Philippines to live with his wife.  He  has
    no friends or family there and he is unable to speak the language.

7.   At [21] of the determination the Judge failed to  appreciate  the  ties
    that the appellant has made here in the UK and her private  life.   The
    Judge failed to consider EX.2 of the Rules which states as follows:

       "EX.2   For  the  purposes  of  paragraph   EX.1(b)   'insurmountable
             obstacles' means the very significant difficulties which would
             be faced by the appellant or their partner in continuing their
             family life together outside the UK and  which  could  not  be
             overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious  hardship  for  the
             applicant or their partner."


8.   The Judge found at [24] that it may be  the  case  that  the  appellant
    would be able to satisfy the Immigration Rules however this was not the
    case because the income threshold is �18,600 and the  sponsor's  income
    is only �17,000.

9.   The Judge failed to consider Izuazu (Article  8  -  New  Rules)  [2013]
    UKUT 45 and distinguish between the appellant and someone whose conduct
    has been criminal.

10.  I heard oral submissions from  both  Mr  Melvin  and  Mr  Kumar.     Mr
    Melvin submitted that there  was  no  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or indeed before the Upper Tribunal  that  �17,000  per  annum
    would not be sufficient in the  Philippines.   Indeed  in  Mr  Melvin's
    opinion the couple would be  considered  wealthy.   The  error  is  not
    material.  There was no Chikwamba argument as far as the  Secretary  of
    State is concerned (Chikwamba and SSHD [2008] UKHL 40).  The  appellant
    does not meet the private life Rules and the requirements  of  Appendix
    FM.  There was no evidence before the Judge that the  sponsor  saw  his
    grandchildren regularly.  The appellant has  extensive  family  in  the
    Philippines.

11.  Mr Kumar confirmed that the appellant was not relying  on  any  further
    evidence should a material error of law be found such that the decision
    of the Judge is set aside.

Conclusions

12.  The Judge made a mistake.  The sponsor's  income  is  �17,000  and  not
    �70,000.  However, in my view, this error does not infect  the  Judge's
    decision in relation to insurmountable obstacles and or  Article  8  of
    the 1950 Convention on Human Rights.

13.  The Judge considered whether  or  not  there  were  any  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK in  accordance  with
    EX.1.(b) of Appendix FM.  The Judge  took  into  account  all  relevant
    factors including the sponsor's health condition (he has had two  heart
    attacks and he also suffers from a bad back and he  takes  medication).
    The Judge was also aware that the sponsor sees his  family  here  every
    week. The sponsor's income of �17,000 is from a pension and the  couple
    would  receive  this  income  should  they  relocate  together  to  the
    Philippines.  There was no  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge that an income of �17,000 would not be sufficient for the  couple
    to live comfortably in the Philippines.  In my view the decision of the
    Judge is not irrational or perverse and there is no material  error  of
    law. The mistake did not lead to unfairness and was not material in  my
    view to the decision.

14.  In relation to the appellant's private life here, the Judge's  decision
    under paragraph 276ADE is lawful and sustainable.  There is no error of
    law contained therein.

15.  The Judge  decided  that  there  were  no  arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules. The  Judge  concluded  that
    there were no exceptional circumstances in this case.  In my view,  the
    Judge took into account all relevant circumstances to a proportionality
    assessment in concluding that the appellant could not succeed under the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge was entitled to  take  into  account  the
    appellant's precarious immigration status  and  did  not  consider  the
    issue on the basis that the appellant was  here  illegally.  The  Judge
    noted the appellant's evidence that she has family in  the  Philippines
    including a 9 year old son. In my view the Judge's decision is one that
    was open to him on the evidence before  him  and  the  grounds  do  not
    establish that it was irrational or perverse.

16.  The Judge went on to  comment  on  the  possibility  of  the  appellant
    making an application for entry clearance.  I have considered  this  in
    the context of the Judge's error in relation to the sponsor's income in
    light of the grounds seeking permission because it seems that the Judge
    was wrong to conclude that the appellant  would  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the  rules.  However,  in  this  context  there  is  no
    material error. The Judge refused  the  application  under  substantive
    Article 8 and there was no need for him  to  go  on  and  consider  the
    possibility of the appellant making a  further  application  for  entry
    clearance.

17.  The decision of the Judge to dismiss the appeal  under  the  Rules  and
    Article 8 of the 1950 Convention on Human Rights is maintained.
