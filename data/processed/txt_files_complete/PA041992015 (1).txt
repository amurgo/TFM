Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Bonavero Counsel instructed by Kirby Jones
Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Albania,  date  of  birth  2  March  1994,
    appealed against the Secretary of State's decision, dated  15  December
    2015, to refuse asylum and/or humanitarian protection  and  rejected  a
    claim to be  at  risk  on  return  on  the  basis  that  she  had  been
    trafficked.

2.   The matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian  who,  on  29
    June 2016, dismissed the Appellant's appeal, made  an  anonymity  order
    and concluded that  the  Appellant  was  simply  not  credible  in  any
    material respect.  It is accepted that a key part of the  analysis  was
    the extent to which the Appellant was judged to be  incredible  because
    she did not know  the  surname  or  the  birthday  of  the  person  who
    trafficked her and also because the judge rejected that the  trafficker
    would have given gifts and been pleasant to the Appellant as a means of
    inducing her into subordination.  The conclusions are in some  respects
    at odds with the background evidence before the judge.

3.   It is accepted by Mr Kotas that the importance  of  those  matters  was
    such that the judge's decision cannot be regarded as  safe  and/or  was
    founded upon factual errors.  In those circumstances, it is accepted by
    the parties  that  the  judge  made  material  errors  of  law  in  the
    assessment of the Appellant's credibility on the  facts  that  he  took
    into account: The  matter  needs  to  be  returned  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be  dealt  with  completely  again.   I  agree  with  those
    submissions but reluctantly do so.  It may be that  great  hope  should
    not be held out to a different outcome but a person must be entitled to
    a fair and reasoned  decision  and  to  that  extent  therefore  it  is
    unfortunate, but necessary, that the matter  be  dealt  with  all  over
    again.  The Original Tribunal decision contains material errors of  law
    and can not stand. The matter must be remade.

DIRECTIONS

1.   List for hearing not before First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian.

2.   Time estimate - 1ï¿½ hours.

3.   Albanian interpreter required.

4.   The Appellant's representatives to serve a fresh  bundle  of  documents
    upon the IAC not later than 14 working days before  the  date  for  the
    further hearing is given.

ANONYMITY
An anonymity order having been made, I direct that it be continued.

DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY - RULE 14 OF  THE  TRIBUNAL  PROCEDURE  (UPPER
TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Signed                                  Date 12 October 2016


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey
