Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Brown of Counsel, instructed by David Gray,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Mangion, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal with permission against a  decision  by  Judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal Holmes dismissing an appeal against refusal of  entry
   clearance as a spouse.  This appeal was heard on 7 April 2014  against  a
   refusal decision of 21 November 2012.  There was  an  earlier  appeal  in
   August 2011 against a refusal decision of 30 November 2010.

2) The appellant is a  national  of  Bangladesh.   The  sponsor  is  both  a
   British citizen and a national of Bangladesh.  At the time of the refusal
   decision the sponsor and the appellant had no children together but on 28
   February 2014 the sponsor gave birth to a son.

3) There were two reasons given by the respondent for the  refusal  decision
   of 21 November 2012.  The first of these was that the appellant  did  not
   have a satisfactory qualification in the English language and the  second
   that the  sponsor  and  the  appellant  would  not  be  able  to  support
   themselves adequately without recourse  to  public  funds,  in  terms  of
   paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules.  The application  was  considered
   under paragraph 281, having been made on 5 July 2012.  By the time of the
   appeal before the First-tier Tribunal, the respondent accepted  that  the
   appellant did have the required level of  qualification  in  English  and
   this was no longer in issue in the appeal.  The sole issue therefore  for
   the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal to consider  under  the  Immigration
   Rules was that of maintenance.

4) The judge  found  that  the  sponsor  was  wholly  dependent  upon  state
   benefits.  At the date of the  decision  appealed  against  she  received
   �82.60 per fortnight by way of Employment  and  Support  Allowance.   The
   judge accepted that it was more likely than not that  she  also  received
   Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit although these benefits were  not
   the subject of documentary evidence.  At the same date, 21 November 2012,
   the judge found that the Income Support rate for a  married  couple  both
   over 18 was �111.45, to which was added the family premium of  �17.40  to
   make a minimum requirement  of  �128.85  per  week.   Having  regard,  in
   particular, to the sponsor's bank statements, the judge was not satisfied
   that the sponsor had given an accurate or  complete  explanation  of  her
   financial affairs but found that the income she received in benefits  was
   less than the Income Support rate for a married couple.

5) The judge had before him  medical  evidence  relating  to  the  appellant
   which appeared to show  that  she  had  mild  learning  difficulties  and
   suffered from moderate depression.  She had previously been married  from
   1992 until 2004.  There were 4 children from the first  marriage  but  it
   seems that they were taken into the care of  the  local  authority.   The
   sponsor blamed the breakdown of her  marriage  upon  physical  abuse  she
   suffered at the hands of her ex-husband.  The sponsor was married in 1992
   in Bangladesh but entered the UK in 1995 to live with  her  husband,  who
   was a British citizen.

6) The judge took into account a job offer made to the appellant.  This  was
   an offer of employment in the kitchen of a  restaurant  called  "Saathi",
   the owner of which was a company called Dulabhai Ltd.  The judge  had  to
   consider whether this was a genuine offer of employment.  The judge noted
   that this offer had been before the previous Tribunal in  the  appeal  in
   August 2011.

7) The judge noted that the company concerned operated two  restaurants  and
   two  take-away  businesses  in  Northumberland  but  the  only  financial
   information disclosed was a VAT return for the period from  May  to  July
   2013.  This did not answer the question  of  whether  the  company  could
   afford to extend a genuine offer of employment to the  appellant  at  the
   date of decision.

8) The judge heard evidence from the  director  of  Dulabhai  Ltd.   In  his
   evidence he said the business was always short of staff and  the  vacancy
   remained open.  The judge nevertheless found the  vacancy  had  not  been
   offered at a wage higher than the national  minimum  wage,  and  had  not
   indeed been advertised either at a job centre or elsewhere.  He had given
   evidence in the previous appeal in August 2011.  The  director  said  the
   vacancy had never been filled since then and that it continued to  exist.
   He acknowledged that when he first made the offer he had never spoken  to
   the appellant but he had since spoken to him by telephone.  He said  that
   as well as receiving the minimum wage for a 37 hour week,  the  appellant
   would get a share of tips and this could amount in  an  average  week  to
   �250 in cash to be shared out.

9) The judge found the vacancy was  not  genuine.   If  the  business  could
   either in 2011 or subsequently genuinely afford to employ someone to fill
   that vacancy it was absurd to suggest that it would still  be  held  open
   for the appellant to take 3 years later.  The appellant  had  an  earning
   capacity but unemployment in the north east of  England  was  high,  even
   within the Bangladeshi community.  The appellant would appear to have few
   transferable skills  and  would  be  bound  to  experience  a  period  of
   unemployment before he found work.

10) Upon finding that the offer of employment was not a  genuine  offer  the
   judge  found  that  the  appellant  could  not   meet   the   maintenance
   requirements of paragraph 281(v).

11) The judge then went on to consider  Article  8  with  reference  to  the
   appellant and the sponsor's child.  The judge noted that  all  4  of  the
   sponsor's previous children had been taken into care, even though at  the
   time the sponsor was living with her first  husband.   This  appeared  to
   point to the sponsor being at least a source (if not the source) of  risk
   to the safety of those children.  Upon the  limited  evidence  available,
   having regard to these  circumstances,  the  judge  could  not  make  any
   findings as to the best interests of the child.  The judge accepted  that
   the appellant and the sponsor were married but both the appellant and the
   sponsor knew at the time they entered into the marriage that in order  to
   live together in  the  UK  the  appellant  would  need  to  obtain  entry
   clearance.  The sponsor had dual nationality and was capable of  visiting
   and living in Bangladesh in safety should  she  choose  to  do  so.   Her
   parents continued to live in Bangladesh in the  family  home,  which  was
   next door to the family home of the appellant.  At the date  of  decision
   she did not have contact with her children.   The  sponsor  was  able  to
   travel to Bangladesh to visit the appellant whenever she chose to  do  so
   and the couple and their child would appear to  be  able  to  live  there
   together  if  they  chose  to  do  so.   The  refusal  decision  was  not
   disproportionate.

Submissions

12) In his submission at the hearing  before  me  Mr  Brown  relied  on  the
   application for permission to appeal.  According to this, the  director's
   evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that recruiting  through  the
   community was more reliable in his experience than using  other  methods.
   The job centre did not yield the calibre of employee that he was  looking
   for.  It was submitted that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did  not
   engage with this evidence.  The director had explained why he  considered
   the appellant was a suitable candidate.

13) The second ground of the application was that the sponsor had now  given
   birth to the appellant's child.  The judge's decision was not  consistent
   with the case of Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.  The child was British and  it
   was in her best interests to remain in the UK.   She should  be  able  to
   grow up in a household with both parents.  The Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal did not take into account the birth of the  child,  particularly
   in light of the vulnerability of the sponsor and the  fact  her  children
   had previously been taken into care.

14) At the hearing Mr Brown said he would expand  upon  these  grounds.   He
   confirmed that the sole issue under the Immigration  Rules  was  that  of
   maintenance.  In relation to the evidence of the director, the judge  had
   found that the vacancy had not been filled.  In making this  finding  the
   judge did not appreciate the nature of  the  evidence  of  the  director.
   Reference was made to a letter of 12 November  2013  from  the  director,
   which was before the First-tier  Tribunal  (page  9  of  the  appellant's
   bundle).  This pointed out that the job on offer  to  the  appellant  had
   been done by two temporary students.  The evidence was that the post  had
   been covered by two people and no full time employee had been  appointed.
   Reference was also made to an earlier letter dated 19 June 2012 from  him
   (page 139 of appellant's bundle) and a  letter  dated  17  December  2012
   (page 230).  Nowhere did the judge deal with  this  evidence,  which  was
   material.  The judge appeared to have been under a  misapprehension  that
   the work had not been covered but it had been covered by two people on  a
   temporary basis.

15) Although Mr Brown acknowledged that this was not in the application,  he
   further submitted that the judge had  disregarded  the  evidence  of  the
   sponsor's brother.  A letter from him dated 22 June 2012  indicated  that
   he had given the sponsor �1000 as a gift (page  171  of  the  appellant's
   bundle).  This evidence was material and should have been addressed.

16)  Mr  Brown  continued  that  there  was  sufficient  material   in   the
   application and the oral submissions to show that the judge's findings on
   maintenance were unsafe.

17)  The  second  issue  was  Article  8.   The  judge  had  suggested   the
   appellant's child could travel to Bangladesh.  At the same time the judge
   had raised the issue of whether social services were concerned  with  the
   child's welfare.  If there was an order by social services in respect  of
   the child this would be an insurmountable  obstacle  to  her  travelling.
   The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal on this point was silent.  Mr
   Brown questioned whether it was open to the judge to make findings  about
   the child's ability to travel.  A proper assessment was required  of  the
   best interests of the child.  The judge's  treatment  of  Article  8  was
   erroneous.

18) On behalf of the respondent, Mr Mangion referred to the letter  from  Mr
   Ahad of 12 November 2013.  It was not clear from this letter whether  the
   temporary students who were providing cover were doing the  work  of  one
   full time employee or not.  The judge had pointed  out  at  paragraph  27
   that it was absurd if the director had been looking for someone  to  fill
   the vacancy for two years and had not succeeded in doing so.  In relation
   to Article 8, it was not for the judge to consider whether there were any
   orders for the care of the child but up to  the  appellant  to  make  his
   case.  The appellant had been represented by  experienced  counsel.   The
   points raised in the application were minor.  The judge was  entitled  to
   find the appellant would face a period of unemployment.

19) Mr Mangion appeared to accept that it would be in the best interests  of
   a British child to have her father with her but he pointed  out  that  it
   was possible for the father to make a further application.  The issue was
   whether any period of delay would be disproportionate.   There  was  also
   the question of whether the child was likely to be taken into care.   The
   judge had looked at these issues in paragraphs 44 and 49.  There  was  no
   evidence from the local authority before the judge.

20)  In  response  Mr  Brown  pointed  out  there  had  been   no   specific
   consideration by the judge of the letters to which he had referred.   The
   director had been telling the truth in his oral evidence when he said  he
   had not filled the full time post.   The  judge  did  not  consider  this
   aspect of the evidence.

Discussion

21) I note that the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  heard  oral  evidence
   from the director.  He found this evidence unsatisfactory  for  two  main
   reasons.  The first was the difficulty he had in believing that  the  job
   in the kitchen of the  Saathi  restaurant  had  been  available  for  the
   appellant since August 2011, when the director gave  evidence  previously
   before the First-tier Tribunal.  The evidence he gave in April  2014  was
   that this vacancy had never been filled and continued to  exist  after  a
   period of nearly 3 years.  The judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  this
   assertion lacked credibility.

22) The second main issue  with  which  the  judge  was  concerned  was  the
   financial viability of the director's  business.    He  had  no  evidence
   before him in relation to the ability  of  the  business  to  employ  and
   remunerate the appellant.

23) In response Mr Brown referred to the three  letters  from  the  director
   specified above.  Reference was also made in the application to  extracts
   from his oral evidence.

24) To what extent do the letters from the director assist  the  appellant's
   case?  The letter of 12 November 2013 (item 9), on which Mr Brown  placed
   considerable store, states that the vacancy in November  2013  was  being
   covered by two temporary students.  This suggests, far from  the  vacancy
   not having been filled, as the director  said  in  his  evidence  at  the
   hearing, the vacancy was filled,  even  if  not  on  a  permanent  basis.
   Although the director in his letter  refers  to  the  students  as  being
   "temporary" it is not clear what was meant by  this  in  the  context  of
   employment law.

25) In addition, the director asserts in the letter that it would  be  "more
   financially viable for one person to  fulfil  the  role".   There  is  no
   reasoning in support of this assertion.   The  director's  oral  evidence
   quoted in the application for permission to appeal seems  to  indicate  a
   preference to recruit restaurant employees from abroad rather  than  from
   within the UK but that personal preference is was not a matter  to  which
   the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal was required  to  have  regard  when
   considering whether this job offer represented a  genuine  vacancy.   The
   judge found on the evidence before him that the vacancy was  not  genuine
   and there is nothing in the evidence to which I was referred by Mr  Brown
   to suggest that the judge was not entitled to make this finding.   It  is
   correct that the judge did not  refer  to  the  three  letters  from  the
   director cited by Mr Brown but the judge was not  required  to  refer  to
   every item of evidence, particularly when he had heard oral evidence from
   the witness who wrote the letters.

26) As I have indicated, I do not consider that the letter  of  12  November
   2013 assists the appellant and the question of whether  the  vacancy  was
   genuine or not is not assisted by the assertion that there was a  vacancy
   having been repeated three times by the  director  in  correspondence  as
   well as in his oral evidence.  The judge was entitled to make the finding
   which he did in relation to  the  vacancy  and  did  not  misconstrue  or
   disregard the evidence in so doing.

27) Mr Brown raised a  further  point  about  the  support  offered  by  the
   sponsor's brother by way of  a  gift  of  �1000.   I  note  that  in  the
   determination, at paragraph 22, the judge  recorded  that  the  sponsor's
   bank statement showed an unexplained deposit of �500 on 23 February 2012.
    The judge indicated that the sponsor's bank statement suggested that she
   was living well within the amount of benefits  that  she  was  receiving.
   The judge was clearly aware of the possibility of third party support and
   directed himself correctly with regard to this  at  paragraph  9  of  the
   determination in terms of the  Immigration  Rules  at  the  date  of  the
   application for entry clearance.  The gift of �1000  referred  to  by  Mr
   Brown would not be adequate to make up the  shortfall  in  the  sponsor's
   income and it does not appear to have been submitted  before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal that it would do so.  Again I find the evidence to which Mr
   Brown has referred in his submission would not have  materially  affected
   the judge's conclusions.

28)  The final issue concerns Article 8 and the birth  of  the  sponsor  and
   the appellant's  child.   Here  the  judge's  decision  as  to  the  best
   interests of the child  is  entirely  clear.   At  paragraph  49  of  the
   determination  the  judge  states  that  on  the  very  limited  evidence
   available he cannot make any finding to the best interests of the  child.
   The judge had previously noted, at paragraph 45, that the sponsor in  her
   evidence denied that she had her own social worker although she  accepted
   that one was appointed before the baby was born and that social  services
   had taken an interest in her since they learned she was pregnant and  had
   taken an interest in her baby.  She said in her evidence  that  a  social
   worker had been appointed to the child and she was to attend on  9  April
   2014 at a meeting with social services.  This meeting  would  have  taken
   place two days after the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.

29)  The  judge  had  before  him  evidence  about  the  sponsor's   medical
   conditions and the difficulties she had  had  coping  with  her  previous
   children.   In  these  circumstances  the  judge  was  entitled  to  draw
   attention to the limited nature of the evidence before him as to the best
   interests of the child.  At the date of the hearing  the  child  was  5-6
   weeks old.  In the normal course of events  the  judge  was  entitled  to
   suppose that there would have been involvement with  the  baby's  welfare
   not only by medical services but also by social  services.   The  sponsor
   herself acknowledged there was social work involvement but there  was  no
   evidence from the local social work department.  In  these  circumstances
   it was proper for the judge to  conclude  that  he  could  not  make  any
   finding as to the best interests of the child.

30) For the purposes of  attempting  to  establish  an  error  of  law,  the
   appellant has concentrated on the judge's  comments  as  to  whether  the
   sponsor and the child would be able to travel to  Bangladesh.   Mr  Brown
   submitted that the child would not be able to do this if  there  was  any
   care or protection order made in respect of her but there was no evidence
   before the First-tier Tribunal  of  any  such  order,  although  evidence
   relating to this is now available.  Mr Mangion acknowledged that it would
   normally be expected that a child would be brought up by both parents but
   in the circumstances of this appeal the child  has  never  had  a  direct
   relationship with her father.  Article 8 requires respect for family life
   but this is subject to the interests of effective immigration control and
   the  test  of  proportionality.   The  judge  considered  the  issue   of
   proportionality and for the  reasons  which  he  gave  he  found  on  the
   evidence  before  him  that  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  was  not
   disproportionate.  There is nothing in the application for permission  to
   appeal or in Mr Brown's  submission  which  shows  that  this  assessment
   contained an error of law.  I should add that  I  was  not  addressed  by
   either party on whether the birth  of  the  child  could  be  taken  into
   account by the judge, in terms of s 85A(2) of the 2002 Act, according  to
   which in an appeal against entry clearance the Tribunal may consider only
   the circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision.

31) There was additional evidence available for the purpose of  the  hearing
   before the Upper Tribunal, although no application for its admission  was
   made under rule 15(2A).  This  additional  evidence  included  a  set  of
   accounts for Dulabhai Ltd for the period ending 31 December 2013.   There
   were also letters about benefits and tax credits for the sponsor, as well
   as a medical report on the sponsor's child and a  letter  dated  17  June
   2014 from the Social Work Department of Newcastle City Council.

32) None of this evidence was before the First-tier Tribunal and it  becomes
   material only if it can be shown that there was an error of  law  in  the
   decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that the judge's decision should
   be set aside.  I have not found any such error.

33) Finally, I note that the judge referred  in  his  determination  to  the
   case of MM [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).  Since the hearing before the First-
   tier Tribunal this case has been considered by the Court  of  Appeal  and
   reported under the name MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  The  Judge  of
   the First-tier Tribunal clearly took the view that the  decision  of  the
   High Court would not materially affect the  outcome  of  the  appeal  and
   indeed the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal indicates that  the
   judge was entitled to take this view.

34) The position is that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  was  entitled
   to make the findings which he did, in  relation  to  both  the  issue  of
   maintenance and the nature of the supposed job vacancy for the appellant,
   as well as in relation to Article 8.  Whether a different decision  might
   be reached in relation to the best interests of the sponsor's child based
   on evidence which is now available, or which may become available, is not
   a matter within the scope of the current proceedings.

Conclusions

35) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

36) I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

37) The  First-tier  Tribunal  made  an  order  for  the  anonymity  of  the
   proceedings and I continue  that  order  (pursuant  to  Rule  14  of  the
   Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
