Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent in this matter is a citizen of Ghana.   His  application
    for leave to enter the UK as a visitor was refused by the Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department (by an Entry  Clearance  Officer)  on  24
    July  2014.   In  refusing  the  application  the  respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant had met the requirements  under  paragraph
    41(i), (ii), (vi) and (vii).  It was contended that the respondent  had
    made three previous applications.   His  birth  certificate  which  was
    dated as issued  32 years after the birth was not a true reflection  of
    his age and identity and the evidence in support of the  personal  cost
    of the visit stated as ï¿½500 was challenged.

2.   The appeal was heard before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Shiner)
    ("FtT") who in a decision and reasons promulgated  on  21  August  2015
    allowed the appeal with reference to the Immigration Rules and  refused
    the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

Grounds of Application for Permission to Appeal

3.   The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal on the  grounds
    that the FtT made a material misdirection of  law.   The  Secretary  of
    State cited the enactment of Section 52 of the Crimes and Courts Act on
    25 June 2013 which restricted the appeal rights for visitors coming  to
    the UK, and which applied to applications made  on  or  after  25  June
    2013.  Section 88A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
    removed the right of  appeal  for  persons  visiting  specified  family
    members. Their appeal rights were  limited  to  grounds  under  Section
    84(1)(b) and (c) of the 2002  Act  namely  on  human  rights  and  race
    relations grounds.

4.   In considering the  appeal  the  FtT  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    restricted rights of appeal.  It did not follow the guidelines set  out
    in Razgar and/or reach any proportionality  assessment  and  failed  to
    have regard to public interest considerations under Section 117B of the
    2002 Act (as amended).

5.   By allowing the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  the  FtT  acted
    outside its jurisdiction which amounted to an error of law.

6.   It was further submitted that Article 8 was not engaged  in  any  event
    because there was no evidence of the necessary  element  of  dependency
    between adult relations such as to constitute family life  (see  Advic,
    Kugathas and Ghisling).

Permission to Appeal

7.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Pooler granted permission  on  29th  December
    2015 in terms that it was arguable that the FtT misdirected  itself  as
    to the availability  of  the  ground  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the Rules.  It was arguable that the appeal could  only
    be brought on limited statutory grounds.

Rule 24 Response

8.   There was no response submitted by the respondent in this matter.

Error of Law Hearing

9.   There was no attendance by or on behalf of the respondent at the  error
    of law hearing.  I was satisfied that the notice of hearing giving  the
    date and time of the Tribunal hearing was sent to the  respondent,  his
    solicitors and to the sponsor.  There was no  communication  by  or  on
    behalf of the appellant and there was no application for an adjournment
    and no explanation for the reasons for the absence of  the  parties  at
    the hearing before me.  Accordingly having satisfied myself that notice
    of the hearing was duly served I proceeded to hear  the  appeal  having
    regard to Rule 38 Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2018.

10.  Mr Bramble submitted that the FtT erred in law by deciding  the  appeal
    on the basis of the applicability of the Immigration  Rules  which  was
    outside its jurisdiction having regard  to  the  restricted  rights  of
    appeal for visit visa applications.

11.   Mr  Bramble  further  submitted  that  at  [31]  the  FtT  had  itself
    considered Article 8 ECHR  and concluded that family life under Article
    8 between a parent and an adult child could only arise where there were
    conditions of particular dependency and/or  emotional  support  between
    the parties following Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31.

Discussion and Decision

12.  I accepted the submissions made by Mr Bramble.  I  was  satisfied  that
    the grounds of appeal were made out in full.  The FtT materially  erred
    in law by reaching a decision that was  outside  of  its  jurisdiction.
    The FtT was restricted by statute to consider the  appeal  under  human
    rights only.

13.  Insofar as the FtT went on to consider Article 8 ECHR, I  am  satisfied
    that the decision reached was correct.  The FtT found that there was no
    family life under Article 8 ECHR between a parent and  an  adult  child
    where there was no evidence of dependency above and beyond  the  normal
    family ties.

14.  Accordingly I find that there  is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision and reasons.  I set aside the decision  to  allow  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.  I substitute a decision  to  dismiss  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.  The appeal is also dismissed under
    Article 8 ECHR.

No anonymity direction is made.
