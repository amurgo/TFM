For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant is a national of the United States  of  America  born  on  the
20th February 1965.  He appeals  with  permission[1]  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal (Judge RBL  Prior)  to  dismiss  his  appeal  against  a
decision to  refuse  to  grant  him  entry  clearance  for  the  purpose  of
settlement.

The Appellant's case was that he is  in  a  long-term  relationship  with  a
British woman, Ms Elaine Davis.  The met in the United States  in  1993  and
have been in a continuous relationship since then. They have  two  children,
Jared who was born in 1996 and Western, born in 1999. Jared was born in  the
United States and so has dual British and American nationality. Western  was
born in the UK and is British.   The family have always  lived  between  the
United States and the United Kingdom.   The  Appellant  has  maintained  his
family relationships by lengthy visits, always returning to  America  before
the time permitted by his visa elapsed.  They in turn have  visited  him  in
America.   They had been happy to continue with this  arrangement  until  in
2013 two matters arose which made them  decide  that  they  needed  to  stay
together  permanently.  The  first  was  that  Western  started   exhibiting
behavioural problems and difficulties at school. The Appellant  visited  him
during the first part of 2013 and observed that during the  period  that  he
was in the UK Western's behaviour stabilised; he was awarded  a  certificate
for being the "most improved student" in the school.  The  second  was  that
Elaine was diagnosed with throat cancer.  So it was that in August 2013  the
Appellant made an application to settle permanently with his family  in  the
UK.

The Respondent considered the application under Appendix FM.  It  was  found
that the Appellant could not meet the eligibility  requirements  because  he
was not a "partner". GEN 1.2  defines  that  term  as  being  limited  to  a
spouse, a civil partner, a fiancï¿½, or at (iv):

         "a person who has been living together  with  the  applicant  in  a
         relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for  at  least
         two years prior to the date of decision"

Since the Appellant and Ms Davis had failed to  demonstrate  that  they  had
been living together "at any time apart from during [his] visits to the  UK"
he was not a "partner"[2].

When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant  submitted
that the application could and should have been considered  under  paragraph
295A of the Immigration Rules:
         295A. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
         the United Kingdom with a view to settlement as the unmarried or
         same-sex partner of a person present and settled in the United
         Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement, are
         that:
         (i) (a)(i) the applicant is the unmarried or same-sex partner of a
         person present and settled in the United Kingdom or who is on the
         same occasion being admitted for settlement and the parties have
         been living together in a relationship akin to marriage or civil
         partnership which has subsisted for two years or more; and
         --(ii) the applicant provides an original English language test
         certificate in speaking and listening from an English language test
         provider approved by the Secretary of State for these purposes,
         which clearly shows the applicant's name and the qualification
         obtained (which must meet or exceed level A1 of the Common European
         Framework of Reference) unless:
             ...
         --(iii) the applicant is a national of one of the following
         countries: Antigua and Barbuda; Australia; the Bahamas; Barbados;
         Belize; Canada; Dominica; Grenada; Guyana; Jamaica; New Zealand; St
         Kitts and Nevis; St Lucia; St Vincent and the Grenadines; Trinidad
         and Tobago; United States of America; or
         ...
         (ii) any previous marriage or civil partnership (or similar
         relationship) by either partner has permanently broken down; and
         (iii) the parties are not involved in a consanguineous relationship
         with one another; and
         (iv) DELETED
         (v) there will be adequate accommodation for the parties and any
         dependants without recourse to public funds in accommodation which
         they own or occupy exclusively; and
         (vi) the parties will be able to maintain themselves and any
         dependants adequately without recourse to public funds; and
         (vii) the parties intend to live together permanently; and
         (viii) the applicant holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance
         for entry in this capacity; and
         (ix) the applicant does not fall for refusal under the general
         grounds for refusal.
The Appellant submitted that he and Ms  Davis  had  lived  together  for  an
aggregate total of  13  years  in  the  preceding  20  years  and  in  those
circumstances they were in a relationship  of  sufficient  constancy  to  be
considered unmarried partners. In the alternative  the  Appellant  submitted
that the appeal should be allowed on Article 8 grounds.

The Tribunal found that the terms of GEN 1.2 and  paragraph  295A  (i)(a)(i)
were in the "present not the pluperfect tense" and that the Appellant  could
not qualify as  an  unmarried  partner  under  either  provision.  That  was
because there had not been a period of two  years  continuous  co-habitation
immediately  preceding  the  application.   It  was  noted  that  since  the
Appellant had returned to the United States in August 2013  there  had  been
no relapse in  Western's  behaviour  and  that  they  had  maintained  their
relationship over  the  phone.   That  long-distance  relationship  was  "no
longer contrary" to Western's best interests. In her illness  Ms  Davis  had
the  emotional  support  of  her  mother  and  friends  and  there  were  no
exceptional or compassionate circumstances to justify  allowing  the  appeal
under Article 8.

The Appellant now has permission to appeal  against  that  decision.  It  is
submitted that:

        i) The determination contains a material  misdirection  in  law  in
           that there is nothing in either 295A (i)(a)(i) or GEN.1.2  which
           requires that the parties have  been  living  together  for  two
           years immediately prior to the application  being  made  or  the
           decision being reached;


       ii) Nor does either  rule  require  that  the  two  year  period  is
           continuous;

      iii) The purpose of the Rule is only to admit  those  for  settlement
           who are in a relationship akin to marriage;

       iv) Failure to consider the  "serious  compassionate  circumstances"
           raised by the family's current circumstances. The  children  are
           separated from their father at a time of crisis for their family
           viz their mother's illness.

Mr Tarlow was not able to direct me to  any  other  material,  for  instance
ministerial statement of policy guidance, which  might  support  the  narrow
reading of the Rule which the First-tier Tribunal imposed.



My Findings

The only issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant can be said to be  Ms
Davis' "partner" within the meaning of the Rules. The other matters  in  the
original refusal have been resolved in his favour. If I find that the First-
tier Tribunal erred in its approach to this question, it  follows  that  the
appeal will be allowed.

The  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Entry  Clearance  Manager  and   First-tier
Tribunal have all applied the same rationale in  rejecting  the  Appellant's
interpretation of the Rule. Each  of  these  decision-makers  have  found  a
requirement, in both 295A and  GEN.1.2,  that  the  "two  years"  must  mean
continuous cohabitation, and that it must immediately precede  the  date  of
application, or decision.

I cannot find any justification for either of  these  conclusions.   GEN.1.2
requires that the sponsor has been living together with the applicant  in  a
relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for at least two  years
prior to the date of decision.  Paragraph 295A (i)(a)(i) is drafted in  very
similar  terms:  the  parties  must  "have  been  living   together   in   a
relationship akin to marriage or civil partnership which has  subsisted  for
two years or more". I can find no  reference  in  either  provision  to  the
period in question being continuous, or to  it  falling  immediately  before
the application. It simply states that there must, in the  past,  have  been
such cohabitation.

In respect of continuity, there are two points to be made.   In  her  review
dated the 19th March 2014 the Entry  Clearance  Manager  H.  Norman  accepts
that there can be "gaps" in the cohabitation but that it must be  for  "good
reasons".  It would seem from the conclusion that the decision of the  adult
parties to conduct their private and family life in  a  manner  that  suited
them did not, in the view of the ECM, constitute such  "good  reasons".    I
cannot see why. Modern family life  can  take  on  many  and  varied  forms.
Committed couples are often separated by work or  family  commitments;  that
does not stop them being committed couples.  The second point to be made  is
that the accepted facts of this case are that in the preceding 20 years  the
sponsor and  Appellant  spent  a  total  of  13  years  together,  thus  far
exceeding the "two year" mark.

At paragraph 18 of the determination the First-tier Tribunal finds that  the
rule is expressed in "the perfect rather than pluperfect"  tense,  and  that
as a result there must be a requirement that the  cohabitation  in  question
is current at the date of application. As  Ms  Tinubu  rightly  points  out,
this would make little sense in respect of applicants  for  entry  clearance
who seek to join spouses already settled in the UK. It is  implicit  in  the
Rule that one of the parties can already be in the UK, thus  precluding  the
cohabitation being current, or immediately preceding the application.

I find that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  its  interpretation  of  the
Rules. There is nothing on the  face  of  the  provisions  themselves  which
support the narrow reading they are given in the determination. If there  is
ambiguity in the Rules, they must be given a purposive  interpretation.  The
purpose is plainly "to allow genuine long-term  relationships  to  continue"
(paragraph 11.72 MacDonald's Immigration Law and Practice 8th ed.). This  is
a  long-term,  stable  and  committed  relationship  of  some  twenty  years
standing, and it should be allowed to continue.

I allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules. I do not therefore  need  to
address the Article 8 arguments in the grounds.




Decisions

The determination contains an error of law and it is set aside.

The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

[1] Permission was refused on the 19th January 2015 by First-tier Tribunal
Judge Chambers but granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Keki |[pic] on the 1st
May 2015.
[2] The application was also refused on the ground that the Appellant had
failed to supply specified evidence of Ms refused on the 19th January 2015
by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers but granted by Upper Tribunal Judge
Keki? on the 1st May 2015.
[3] The application was also refused on the ground that the Appellant had
failed to supply specified evidence of Ms Davis' income, or written
consent from the landlord agreeing that he could live in her property with
her and the children.  In a review conducted by an Entry Clearance Manager
on the 19th March 2014 this reason for refusal was withdrawn.
