                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Proceedings

   1. The Appellants are both citizens of India. The first Appellant who was
      born on 8th of June 1984 and who I shall refer to as the Appellant  is
      the father of the 2nd Appellant who was born on 11th  of  April  2014.
      They appealed against  decisions  of  the  Respondent  dated  14th  of
      January 2016 to refuse them entry clearance as a partner in  the  case
      of the Appellant and as a child in the case of the 2nd Appellant under
      Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. Their appeals  were  allowed  by
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Majid sitting at Taylor House on 22nd
      of May 2017. The Respondent appeals with leave against  that  decision
      and for the reasons which I  have  set  out  below  I  have  set  that
      decision aside. Thus, although the matter comes before me initially as
      an appeal by the Respondent, for the sake of convenience I continue to
      refer to the parties as they were known at first instance.


   2. The Appellant wished to join his wife Shymamol Puthiyodathel  who  had
      been  granted  permanent  residence  in  the  United   Kingdom   ("the
      Sponsor"). The 2nd Appellant was the couple's child and  was  applying
      to enter at the same time as his father. The application  was  refused
      by  the  Respondent  on  the  grounds  that  the  Sponsor  could   not
      demonstrate that  she  met  the  income  threshold  derived  from  her
      employment with Olive Business Services.  It  was  a  near  miss,  the
      Sponsor had to show an annual income before tax of  at  least  �22,400
      allowing for the Appellant and  the  couple's  child.  The  Respondent
      refused the  application  on  the  basis  that  the  Sponsor's  income
      amounted to �22,285.71p just  under  �115  short  of  the  limit.  The
      Respondent also took issue  with  the  payslips  from  Olive  Business
      Services which showed 3 months in 2015 all as tax period 6.  The  bank
      statements produced  by  the  Sponsor  were  said  not  to  be  in  an
      acceptable format.


   3. The grounds of appeal against the Respondent's  decision  argued  that
      the relevant six-month period ran from June  to  November  (inclusive)
      2015 because the applications for entry clearance  were  submitted  on
      7th of December 2015 and therefore  the  earnings  in  May  2015  were
      irrelevant. This calculation  produced  an  income  of  �12,000  which
      doubled produced an annual  income  of  �24,000,  which  exceeded  the
      requirements.  The  Respondent,  it  was  argued,  should  have   used
      discretion to investigate the problem  of  the  bank  statements.  The
      reference to tax period 6 was a minor clerical error  which  had  been
      overlooked by the Sponsor's employer.  There  was  a  mistake  in  the
      refusal of the 2nd Appellant which referred to another  individual  as
      the 2nd Appellant's mother.


   4. The Judge allowed the appeal in the First-tier  noting  the  Sponsor's
      evidence at [6] that  she  earned  at  least  �24,000  per  annum  and
      therefore met the financial threshold. The difficulty in this case  is
      that the Judge did not go on to make a finding  on  whether  that  was
      indeed the case. Had he done so and  given  a  finding  on  this  core
      issue, with adequate reasons the appeal may well  have  stopped  there
      subject to an Article 8 assessment. Unfortunately,  despite  the  fact
      that the Judge spent 3 pages under the heading "The Relevant  Law"  he
      did not come to grips with this issue. At [16] the  Judge  stated:  "a
      review of all the evidence adduced by the Appellant convinces me  that
      the appeal should be allowed". That conclusion needed to be explained.
      The Judge said that he would not spend time giving reasons for matters
      he deemed to be marginal. It  is  not  clear  from  the  determination
      whether he regarded the Sponsor's earnings as marginal. If he did that
      was clearly an error.


   5. The Respondent appealed against the Judge's decision arguing that  the
      First-tier had made no findings on the relevant passage in the  notice
      of refusal which was then cited in the  grounds.  The  Respondent  had
      simply no idea why he had lost the appeal. The Judge had also  made  a
      number of political statements in the determination which quite  apart
      from their irrelevance to  the  issues  in  the  case,  concerned  the
      Respondent as to whether the Judge had approached  the  case  with  an
      open mind.


   6.  Permission to appeal was refused by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
      Grimmett on 26th of July 2017. She conceded that the decision was very
      difficult to follow and had failed to consider any specified  evidence
      but as the appeal was on human rights grounds and the Sponsor appeared
      to have been earning �24,000 at the time of decision she felt it would
      not be proportionate to keep the family apart.


   7. The Respondent renewed his request for permission to appeal and  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Kamara granted permission on  25th  of  September  2017
      stating it was arguable  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  adequately
      address the issues identified by the  Respondent  in  the  refusal  of
      entry clearance or give adequate reasons for allowing the appeal.


   8. When the matter came  on  before  me  on  20th  of  December  2017  to
      determine whether there was a material error of law in  the  decision,
      it was conceded by counsel that the determination  of  the  First-tier
      was inadequate in certain  respects  although  the  principle  of  the
      appeal was not conceded. I indicated I found a material error  of  law
      in the determination and set it aside.   There  was  no  objection  by
      counsel or the Presenting Officer to the matter being remitted back to
      the First-tier to be reheard.

Findings

   9. The issues in the case were; (i) whether the Sponsor  could  meet  the
      financial requirements and (ii) since the  appeal  was  on  Article  8
      grounds only, whether  the  decision  represented  a  disproportionate
      interference with the family life of the Appellant, Sponsor and  their
      child. On the Respondent's case, this was  a  "near  miss"  under  the
      Immigration Rules and there were no exceptional circumstances to allow
      this appeal outside the Rules. On the Appellant's case, the  financial
      requirements were met  and  the  interference  with  family  life  was
      disproportionate.


  10.  The refusal of permission to appeal by the First-tier  Judge  assumed
      that the financial requirements were met but it is not  at  all  clear
      that that was a finding made by the First-tier Judge. It needs  to  be
      made alongside a careful assessment of Article 8. Before  deciding  to
      remit this case back to the First-tier I  considered  whether  it  was
      appropriate for me to proceed to remake the  decision  on  the  appeal
      having established that there was a  material  error  of  law  in  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal by reason of the factors I set out
      at [4] above. I considered that that was not appropriate in this  case
      since no facts had been found and the Article  8  assessment  had  not
      been properly carried out or at all. In  those  circumstances  and  in
      accordance with the Senior President's Practice Direction I remit this
      appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard at Taylor House  by
      any Immigration Judge (save Dr Majid). It would be  of  assistance  to
      the Judge who will be hearing this appeal de novo to be given a  clear
      statement of what the Sponsor's earnings were in the period running up
      to the application and full details of the Article  8  claim  in  this
      case.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making  of  a  material
    error of law and I have set it aside. I remit this  case  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal to be heard by any Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    de novo.

I make no anonymity orders as there  is  no  public  policy  reason  for  so
    doing. No anonymity orders were made at first instance.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the decision has been set aside so has the  fee  award  and  this  matter
will need to be dealt with by the Judge who re-hears this appeal de novo  in
the First-tier.
