                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms J Todd, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chana, promulgated on 22 November 2016.

 2. The grounds make several complaints.  The  more  significant  ones  are
    summarised in the grant of permission as (1) not taking  account  of  a
    medical report, going to memory, when  assessing  credibility;  (2)  no
    account taken of evidence about conditions in Greece, Italy and France,
    as to not claiming there; (3) no  consideration  of  conclusions  in  a
    medical report about scarring; and (4) absence of any consideration  of
    a linguistic report obtained by appellant.

 3. Although not specifically attacked in the grounds, ï¿½44 of the  decision
    should be noted, "Given that I do not find the appellant credible on so
    many issues, I accept the report of the [respondent's] language analyst
    ... I therefore find that the appellant is an  Egyptian  not  a  Syrian
    national".  That is,  at  least,  an  unfortunate  error  of  phrasing.
    That report, like the rest of the evidence, was for assessment  on  its
    merits as well as in context.

 4. As an incidental further matter, it was not for  the  judge  to  decide
    what nationality the appellant has, but only whether he established  to
    the necessary standard the case he advanced.

 5. The Presenting Officer conceded error of law, such as  to  require  re-
    hearing.

 6. That concession was correctly and  fairly  made.   While  each  of  the
    grounds might not have been found individually  to  require  a  setting
    aside, there is no doubt of their cumulative effect.

 7. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said  at  the  hearing.   The
    nature of the case is such that it is appropriate in terms  of  section
    12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice Statement 7.2 to remit  the
    case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.  The  member(s)  of  the
    FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include Judge Chana.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
