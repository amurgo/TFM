Representation:

For the Secretary of State:                  Mr Paul Duffy, Specialist
Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:        Ms A Seehra, Counsel instructed by
                                   Fitzpatrick & Co, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal  against  the
    decision by the Secretary of State to refuse  to  grant  her  leave  to
    remain as an adult dependent relative outside the Rules. The First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and I do  not  consider  that
    such an order is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.



 2. On 6 July 2012 Cleveland & Co Solicitors submitted  an  application  on
    behalf of the appellant, who is a Ghanaian national and whose  date  of
    birth is 11 September 1944.  In a covering letter, they said they  were
    instructed that the appellant had initially arrived in the UK on 13 May
    2003 as a visitor and was granted six months' leave  to  enter.   As  a
    result of unscrupulous legal advice from a  legal  representative,  she
    had overstayed through no fault of hers.  The basis of her  application
    for ILR was that firstly she was a widowed mother over the age  of  65.
    Secondly,  she  was  living  in  the  most  exceptional,  compassionate
    circumstances before coming to the UK in  2003.   She  was  financially
    wholly and mainly  dependent  on  relatives  and  friends  present  and
    settled in the UK.  She had no-one to care or her if she was forcefully
    returned to Ghana.  Her family here  had  provided  her  with  all  the
    amenities of life and love, abundant care  and  happiness.   She  would
    continue to be maintained and accommodated adequately without  recourse
    to public funds in accommodation owned or occupied exclusively  by  the
    family in the UK.  Above all, their client had no relatives in Ghana to
    whom she could turn to for financial support. In the alternative, their
    client relied on Article 8 by virtue of the fact  she  had  established
    private and family life in the UK.  Her children were settled here, and
    her grandchildren would dearly miss her if she was removed from the UK.
     Her removal would be disproportionate.

 3. On 15 May 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing the
    claimant's application.  She had remained in the United Kingdom  beyond
    the period of her permitted leave, and  she  was  a  person  liable  to
    administrative removal in accordance with Section 10 of the Immigration
    and Asylum Act 1999.  Notice to that effect (IS15A, notice to a  person
    liable to removal) was enclosed. Her application for settlement did not
    fall within the Immigration Rules, published  policies  or  concessions
    outlined in the IDIs.  She was seeking a variation of leave to enter or
    remain for a purpose not covered by the Rules, and so  her  application
    was refused under paragraph 322(1) of HC 395 as amended.

 4.  Consideration  had  been  given  to  her  rights  in  respect  of  any
    family/private life she may have established in the UK.  She  said  she
    had established family life in the UK with her 40-year-old daughter and
    her 37-year-old son.  Paragraph A277C and Appendix FM of the Rules  set
    out the criteria the government expected a person to fulfil in order to
    establish a right to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of their
    family life.  She did not meet the requirements of Appendix FM.

 5. Regard also had been given to paragraph 276ADE of the Rules in order to
    address any private life factors that she  had  raised.   She  had  not
    lived continuously in the UK for at least twenty  years.   Furthermore,
    she had resided in Ghana for the majority of her life, and it  was  not
    accepted she  had  severed  all  ties  with  Ghana,  including  social,
    cultural and family ties.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Del Fabbro  sitting  at  Taylor
    House in the First-tier Tribunal on 19 March 2014.   The  claimant  was
    represented by Miss  Seehra  of  Counsel,  and  an  unnamed  Presenting
    Officer appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State.

 7. The judge heard submissions on  a  preliminary  issue  raised  by  Miss
    Seehra.  This was  that  the  decision  appealed  against  was  not  in
    accordance  with  the  law.   Miss  Seehra's  reasoning  was  that  the
    application  had  been  made  before  the  introduction  of   the   new
    Immigration Rules, which came into force on 9 July 2012, and  therefore
    the application should have been assessed as against  the  criteria  of
    the old Rules.  The judge ruled in  favour  of  the  claimant  on  this
    issue.  He found that the decision was not in accordance with the  law,
    and held that he could reconsider the application under paragraph  317;
    and that if  he  found  that  the  claimant  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 317, he  could  allow  the  appeal.   Alternatively,  if  the
    claimant did not meet the requirements of paragraph  317,  he  said  he
    would need to consider her position as  regards  to  Article  8  rights
    according to the criteria which existed prior to the coming into  force
    of paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM.

 8. The judge received evidence from  the  claimant,  her  daughter  and  a
    family friend, Mr Desmond Can-Abaidoo.  He was  a  finance  manager  in
    local government, and had provided evidence of his financial  standing.
    He lived alone and out of his salary he regularly paid ï¿½100 towards the
    claimant's financial support.  He regarded the claimant as he would his
    own parents.  The judge also received oral evidence from the claimant's
    son, Mr Marcus Larson.

 9. In closing  submissions  of  the  respondent,  the  Presenting  Officer
    submitted that the claimant did not meet the criteria of the old Rules.
     As for her Article 8 claim, her Article 8 rights  have  been  properly
    considered in the refusal  letter.   She  deliberately  overstayed  for
    eleven years, and in that context acquired very  limited  rights  to  a
    private and family life in the UK.  She had not demonstrated  that  she
    had no ties to Ghana.  She had  cultural  and  social  ties  which  she
    maintained to this day.  There were telephone calls to classmates where
    they exchanged news about mutual friends.  There was also  inconsistent
    evidence about her contact with her sons who lived with her  in  Ghana.
    There was no evidence of their status in Nigeria,  and  no  reason  why
    they could not have returned  to  Ghana.   Her  husband's  brother  had
    family there and several nephews and nieces still lived in  Ghana.   As
    far as maintenance and accommodation was concerned, the  local  housing
    authority had not formally noted  that  she  occupied  and  shared  her
    current accommodation with her daughter.  Her position  was  precarious
    in relation to her housing.  She was not wholly or  mainly  financially
    dependent on her daughter.  Mr Desmond Can-Abaidoo was a  good  friend,
    but not a family member.  Financial support from him appeared to  be  a
    haphazard arrangement.  The claimant had failed to make out a case that
    there was adequate support and maintenance for her in the UK.

10. In reply, Miss Seehra submitted that even  if  she  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 317, then this was a case where  the  removal
    of the claimant after having lived in the United Kingdom for the better
    part of eleven years would be disproportionate.  There was no  evidence
    of family members living in Ghana to whom she could turn for  financial
    support.

11. The judge's findings are  set  out  in  paragraphs  23  to  29  of  his
    subsequent determination.  He found that the evidence he  had  received
    from the claimant  and  her  supporting  witnesses  was  credible.   He
    thereby concluded that in all the circumstances the  claimant  met  the
    criteria of paragraph 317.

12. He went on to consider Article 8 in the alternative.  He observed  that
    at the date of decision there was apparent overlap between Rule  276ADE
    and Article 8 rights and jurisprudence.   Ogundimu  (Article  8  -  new
    Rules)  Nigeria  [2013]  UKUT  0060  provided  some  insight  into  the
    requirement of Rule 276ADE(vi).  Although the claimant had  lived  most
    of her adult life in Ghana and only left there in 2003,  the  substance
    of her existing ties and her advanced age meant that she was now likely
    to have lost those ties.  She had not lived in Ghana for at  least  ten
    years and was nearly 70 years of age.  Her family's social network  was
    rooted in the United Kingdom as evidenced in  the  bundle  before  him:
    "She no longer enjoys any ties of substance in Ghana".

13. Even if she did not meet the requirements of Rule 276ADE, consideration
    had to be given as to whether she qualified for leave to remain outside
    the Rules.  The guidance which was contained in the Long Residence  and
    Private  Life  Guidance  valid  from  11  November  2013  showed   that
    exceptional circumstances were considered by the Secretary of State  to
    mean  circumstances  where  refusal  and  removal   would   result   in
    unjustifiably harsh  consequences  for  the  individual;  and  that  an
    overall  consideration  of  facts  and  all  relevant  factors  in  the
    particular  case  before  him  would  suggest  that  there   would   be
    unjustifiable harsh consequences for a 70-year-old widow with no social
    ties trying to re-establish her  life  in  Ghana.  He  had  taken  into
    consideration  the  relevant  authorities  of  Razgar,  Huang  and   MF
    (Nigeria), and other decisions  when  considering  the  impact  on  the
    family unit as a whole.  It was clear that there would be a significant
    impact felt by the claimant and the family unit including the children.
     Evidence before him, including  letters  written  by  those  children,
    suggested they had a very close relationship with  the  claimant.   She
    had a direct input into their daily lives.

14. The judge concluded at paragraph 29 that the claimant would  be  placed
    in an unjustifiably harsh situation in Ghana.   Although  she  probably
    would still be able to rely on financial support from her family in the
    United Kingdom, the practical  help  and  emotional  support  that  was
    available here from family and friends could not  be  replicated.   The
    interference with the Article 8 right to a private and family  life  in
    the UK would be in all the circumstances disproportionate.





The Application for Permission to Appeal

15. The Secretary of State applied for permission to  appeal,  raising  two
    grounds.  Ground 1 was that the judge had materially  directed  himself
    in law  in  holding  that  the  claimant's  application  needed  to  be
    considered under the old Rules.  The Statement of Changes  referred  to
    by him made it  clear  that  someone  such  as  the  claimant  who  had
    overstayed her permitted stay by a number of years did not qualify  for
    consideration under the Immigration Rules in  force  prior  to  9  July
    2012.

16. Ground 2 was that the judge failed to give reasons or adequate  reasons
    for findings on material matters.  The  judge  had  failed  to  provide
    adequate reasons as to why the claimant would be  living  in  the  most
    exceptional compassionate circumstances.  He failed to consider whether
    her family could hire care for her in  Ghana,  or  whether  her  family
    could send her money and find accommodation for her.

17. The judge also failed to provide adequate reasons for  the  finding  in
    paragraph 27 that she had no ties to Ghana, where  she  had  spent  her
    youth and formative years and almost all her adult life.  She would  be
    fully familiar with the culture and customs in Ghana.  Even if  she  no
    longer had any family there, she would have  friends  and  connections.
    It would not be unusually harsh for her  to  resume  contact  with  her
    friends there.

18.  Finally,  any  Article  8  assessment  should  only  be   made   after
    consideration under the new Rules.  It was made clear in Gulshan [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC) that the Article 8 assessment should only  be  carried
    out when there were compelling circumstances not recognised by the  new
    Rules.  In this case, the Tribunal did  not  identify  such  compelling
    circumstances,  and  therefore  the  findings  under  Article  8   were
    unsustainable.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

19. On 20 June 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher granted permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

         "The  evidence  appears  to  be  that  she   lived   in   difficult
         circumstances in Ghana, but it  is  arguable  that  the  judge  has
         conflated her lack of means and a pension with the circumstances in
         which she was living.

         I conclude that this is an arguable error of  law  in  the  judge's
         reasoning which is capable of affecting the decision made."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

20. At the hearing before me, Mr Duffy withdrew ground 1 of the appeal.  He
    could find nothing to support the proposition  that  the  Statement  of
    Changes made it clear that someone such as the claimant did not qualify
    for consideration under the Rules in force prior to 9 July 2012.

21. He submitted that the judge had  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
    claimant met all the requirements of paragraph 317.  He had  not  given
    adequate reasons for finding that at the date of the hearing before him
    the claimant would have been wholly or mainly financially dependent  on
    her relatives in the UK if she had been in Ghana, whereas the  evidence
    was that the main source of funding for  the  claimant  in  the  United
    Kingdom was Mr Can-Abaidoo.

22. With regard to the judge's Article 8 assessment, he submitted that  the
    judge's finding on Rule 276ADE(vi) was inadequately reasoned.

23. In reply, Miss Seehra relied on her written Rule 24  response  opposing
    the appeal.  The judge was correct to find the new Rules did not apply,
    as this was supported by Edgehill & Another v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 402.
     The argument that the judge had failed to give  adequate  reasons  for
    his findings was perverse.  Overall, the  judge's  decision  was  clear
    that  the  proposed  removal  was  disproportionate  and  resulted   in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences.

24. The argument raised by Mr Duffy with regard to  subparagraph  (iii)  of
    paragraph 317 has not been raised in the Secretary of  State's  grounds
    of appeal, and it was too late for him to raise it  now.   She  opposed
    any addition to the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal at this late
    stage.

Discussion

25. At the time of application, the claimant was already over  the  age  of
    65.  So if she was eligible for consideration under Rule 317,  she  did
    not need to satisfy the hypothetical requirement that, if she had  been
    in Ghana at the date of decision, she would have been living  alone  in
    the most exceptional, compassionate circumstances.

26. Under Appendix FM, the requirements that have to be satisfied to obtain
    entry clearance or leave to remain as an adult dependent  relative  are
    much more onerous than those contained in Rule 317,  and  the  claimant
    would not satisfy the new requirements.

27. Accordingly, it is an issue of central  importance  whether  Judge  Del
    Fabbro was right to consider her application under Rule  317,  although
    she was an overstayer at the date  of  application.   Even  though  the
    claimant's former legal representatives did not invoke  Rule  317  when
    making the application, and expressly stated that the  application  was
    being made outside the Rules, Mr Duffy said  that  he  could  not  find
    anything to support the position taken in the grounds  of  appeal  that
    the claimant was debarred from qualifying for leave to remain under the
    old Rule.  He further stated that in his experience Rule 317  had  been
    invoked in the past in in-country appeals not only  by  those  who  had
    extant leave (of whatever type) at the date of application, but also by
    overstayers.

28. At paragraph 25 of his determination, the judge held that the appellant
    was living in exceptional, compassionate circumstances in  Ghana  prior
    to coming to the UK, given that her adult sons had  left  their  shared
    rented home, and she had no means of support and no pension.

29. As was intimated by the  judge  granting  permission  to  appeal,  this
    finding is tendentious and inadequately reasoned.  Her circumstances in
    2003 were alleviated by the fact that she  was,  as  the  judge  found,
    receiving financial support from her family present and settled in  the
    United Kingdom.  Moreover, her evidence, as recorded in paragraph 9  of
    the judge's determination, was simply that she was living in  difficult
    circumstances before she came  to  the  United  Kingdom.   So  her  own
    evidence fell short of asserting that she was living alone in the  most
    exceptional, compassionate circumstances in 2003.   Moreover,  if  this
    was in fact the case, then it would follow that she had  misrepresented
    her circumstances to the Entry Clearance Officer  in  order  to  obtain
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a visitor.   Finally,  if  she
    was still in contact with old school friends in Ghana  even  now,  many
    years after she had left Ghana, it was reasonably to be  inferred  that
    she was not living in a state of social isolation in Ghana prior to her
    arrival in the United Kingdom on 13 May 2003.

30. But the  judge's  finding  on  the  claimant's  situation  in  2003  is
    irrelevant, as it was her hypothetical situation in Ghana at  the  date
    of decision and/or hearing that determined whether  she  qualified  for
    leave to remain under Rule 317.  The finding was  also  irrelevant  for
    another reason, which was that the claimant was over the age of  65  at
    the date of the decision/hearing.  So she did not need to show that she
    would  be  living  alone  in  the   most   exceptional,   compassionate
    circumstances if she was currently in Ghana.

31. Mr Duffy submits that the judge has  not  given  adequate  reasons  for
    concluding in paragraph 26  that  she  would  continue  to  be  totally
    dependent on her UK relatives for financial support if she  was  living
    in Ghana, and that  the  lack  of  adequate  reasoning  on  this  topic
    undermines the conclusion that the appellant met  the  requirements  of
    Rule 317.

32. While it is true that a friend of the claimant's was providing her with
    financial support in the United Kingdom, it does not  follow  that  the
    same  financial  arrangements  would  apply   if   the   claimant   was
    hypothetically in Ghana.  The judge found that, following the departure
    of the adult sons to Nigeria, the  claimant  became  wholly  or  mainly
    financially dependent on her family present and settled in  the  United
    Kingdom at that time.  It was a reasonable inference for the  judge  to
    draw that, if the claimant was hypothetically in Ghana now, there would
    be a restoration of the status quo ante,  and  the  claimant  would  be
    wholly or mainly financially dependent on  her  family  in  the  United
    Kingdom as before.  In any event, the judge does  not  make  a  finding
    that Mr Can-Abaidoo is the claimant's main source of financial  support
    in the UK.  He simply records evidence  from  Mr  Can-Abaidoo  that  he
    regularly pays ï¿½100 towards the claimant's support,  but  there  is  no
    information given as to whether this payment is monthly or weekly.

33. The Presenting Officer below questioned whether there was  satisfactory
    evidence that the claimant would be maintained and accommodated without
    recourse to public funds if she was allowed to stay.  Given the lack of
    clarity over the extent of Mr Can-Abaidoo's support,  I  can  see  some
    force in this argument.  But there is no challenge in the Secretary  of
    State's grounds of appeal  to  the  judge's  findings  on  adequacy  of
    maintenance and accommodation.

34. Accordingly, I find that the Secretary of State's limited error of  law
    challenge to the judge's finding under Rule 317 is not  made  out,  and
    that the decision allowing the appeal under Rule 317 does  not  contain
    an error of law.

35. In view of this conclusion, the challenge  to  the  judge's  Article  8
    assessment becomes academic.  But I do not in any event  consider  that
    an error of law is made out.  The judge has effectively followed a two-
    stage approach, considering the appellant's Article 8 claim under  Rule
    276ADE, before going on to consider whether she qualifies for leave  to
    remain outside the Rules on the grounds of  exceptional  circumstances.
    Although the judge's finding under Rule 276ADE(vi) could be said to  be
    a generous one, it is nonetheless sustainable,  having  regard  to  the
    guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in Ogundimu, to  which  the  judge
    makes reference.  While it is true, as argued in the grounds of  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal, that the claimant cannot  be  said  to  have  no
    social  or  cultural  ties  to  Ghana  in  a  literal  sense,  Ogundimu
    illuminated the importance of ascertaining whether  the  applicant  has
    "effective" ties to the country of return, such that he or she can lead
    an adequate private life there,  and  such  that  the  consequences  of
    returning him or her would not be unjustifiably  harsh.   Although  the
    judge addressed the question of unjustifiably harsh consequences  as  a
    separate consideration outside the Rules, his findings on that question
    underpin his finding under Rule 276ADE(vi).

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  The Secretary  of  State's  appeal  to
the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
