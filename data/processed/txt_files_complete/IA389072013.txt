                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is  an  Indian  citizen.   She  appeals  with  permission
    against the determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parker  on  9
    April 2014 who dismissed her appeal against the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to refuse to vary her leave to remain in the United Kingdom on
    private and family life grounds under Article 8 ECHR, and to remove her
    by way of directions under Section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 2. At the date of application the appellant still had valid student  leave
    in the United Kingdom which is extended by operation of Section 3C.

 3. The appellant has a spouse in India and two children now aged 13 and 6;
    no divorce proceedings are underway.  She has,  however,  also  entered
    into a relationship while  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  a  Ukrainian
    citizen who has indefinite leave to remain here. At  the  date  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing she had borne him a child, who was  then  4
    months old.

First-tier Tribunal determination

 4. The appeal in the First-tier Tribunal turned on Article 8  outwith  the
    Immigration Rules only, it being accepted that  the  Immigration  Rules
    could not be met.  At paragraph 29 of the determination the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge directed himself as follows:

         "I note  the  guidance  uses  the  word  exceptional.   This  means
         circumstances in which refusal would result in unjustifiably  harsh
         consequences for the individual or their family such  that  refusal
         of the application would not be proportionate.  That is  likely  to
         be  the  case  only  very  rarely.   The  appellant's  partner  has
         indefinite leave and the child is a British  citizen.   The  stated
         intention of the appellant and [her partner] is that they  wish  to
         remain in this country.  Therefore, [if she is returned  to  India]
         they will only be separated for a short period  of  time.   If  she
         wishes to use that time in India to file for  divorce  and  make  a
         contact application [for her Indian children] that is  her  choice.
         In law those issues may be regarded as mere hardship and not unduly
         harsh consequences, given the fact that the appellant's  father  is
         in well-paid employment.  There is no suggestion that she  will  be
         abandoned by her partner and she will be supported  by  him  whilst
         she returns to India to make the application.  If the child remains
         behind with the father then childcare arrangements will have to  be
         made.  I therefore do not find that the appellant has satisfied the
         test set out in Gulshan."

Basis of appeal

 5. The appellant challenged the determination on the basis that the First-
    tier Tribunal had failed properly to apply Zoumbas v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department  [2013] UKSC 74,  Sanade  and  others  (British
    children - Zambrano - Dereci) India [2012] UKUT  48  (IAC)  and  Azimi-
    Moayed and others (decisions affecting children; onward  appeals)  Iran
    [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC) or to give proper weight to  the  status  of  her
    child as a British citizen.

 6.  She  also  contended  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in   its
    interpretation of the weight to be given to R ota Zhang v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department  [2013] EWHC 891 in the light of  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2012] UKUT  640  (IAC)  and
    that at paragraph 30 of  the  determination,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in stating that Article 8 did not need to be  considered  in  the
    determination, that being the only issue  which  was  live  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hemingway
    on all grounds.



Rule 24 Reply on behalf of respondent

 8. The respondent in her Reply  contended  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge had directed himself appropriately and that, in particular:

         "3.  The Judge was aware that he was dealing with a British citizen
         child and took the view that it was not be disproportionate in  the
         circumstances to expect the appellant to return to  India  with  or
         without the child  to  obtain  the  necessary  entry  clearance  to
         return.  He applies [sic] the case of Gulshan, and takes  the  view
         that there are no compelling or exceptional circumstances.  He  was
         entitled to arrive at this conclusion."

 9. The respondent opposed the appeal and requested an oral hearing.

Appellant's Rule 24 Response

10. On 14 August 2014, the appellant's representatives filed a response  to
    the respondent's Reply.  That response was not filed in time but I have
    treated it as a skeleton argument for the appellant.

11. In addition to the matters already pleaded, the  appellant  now  relied
    upon R ota MM (Lebanon) and others v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2014] EWCA Civ 985, published on  11  July  2014,  arguing
    that the effect of paragraphs 128-129 thereof was to overturn the 'two-
    stage' Gulshan test and substitute a consideration as to whether in any
    particular case the Rules were a complete code, failing  which  a  full
    Razgar proportionality assessment was required.

12. The appellant argued that the respondent's Reply was  no  more  than  a
    mere disagreement with the grant of  permission  and,  by  implication,
    that it should be disregarded.  The appellant relied  on  the  case  of
    Nixon (permission to appeal - grounds) [2014] UKUT 000368  which  deals
    with  inadequately   particularised   permission   applications.    The
    relevance of Nixon is unclear in relation  to  the  respondent's  Reply
    and, although brief, I do not find that the Reply lacks clarity  as  to
    the reasons for sustaining the decision under challenge.

13. Finally, at paragraph 9, the Response states that:

         "9.  In accordance with the Procedure Rules he also applies to rely
         on further evidence why she cannot return home to India."

    For the appellant, Mr Chohan accepted that no such  evidence  had  been
    provided and that paragraph 9 did  not  amount  to  a  proper  Rule  15
    request to adduce further evidence.

14. That was the basis on which the appeal came before me.

Upper Tribunal hearing

15. For the appellant, Mr Chohan relied on his grounds  and  his  Response.
    He argued, as set out in the Response, that after MM there was no  two-
    stage Gulshan test and that the Upper Tribunal should proceed simply to
    deal with Article 8 outwith the Rules.  He relied on Azimi-Moayed.   He
    asked me to set aside the  First-tier  Tribunal  determination  and  to
    allow the appeal.

16. For the respondent, Mr  Melvin  argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination was not erroneous.  In particular, he sought to  persuade
    me that there was no error of law in considering that the appellant had
    a choice between taking her 4-month old child back to India  with  her,
    or leaving the child in the United Kingdom with the father.  He did not
    consider that any particular weight should be placed on the very  young
    age of the baby at the date of hearing.

Legal framework

17. I begin by reminding myself of the guidance available from the  decided
    cases relied upon by the appellant.  The cases relied  upon  deal  with
    two points, the proper approach  to  the  best  interests  of  children
    pursuant to s.55 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 (whether
    citizen or non-citizen children); and the correct approach to Article 8
    overall,  applying  either  the  Nagre/Gulshan  approach  or,  as   the
    appellant argued, considering Article 8  in  the  round,  following  MM
    (Lebanon) and Zhang.

The best interests of children

18. The first case on  which  the  appellant  relies  concerning  the  best
    interests of children is Zoumbas,  in  which  Lord  Hodge,  giving  the
    judgment of the  court,  at  paragraph  [10]  set  out  the  principles
    applicable to the removal of children from the United Kingdom with  (or
    without) their parents:

         "(1) The best interests of a child are  an  integral  part  of  the
         proportionality assessment under article 8 ECHR;
         (2) In making that assessment, the best interests of a  child  must
         be a primary consideration, although not always  the  only  primary
         consideration; and the child's best interests do not of  themselves
         have the status of the paramount consideration;
         (3) Although the best interests of a child can be outweighed by the
         cumulative effect of other considerations, no  other  consideration
         can be treated as inherently more significant;
         (4) While different judges might approach the question of the  best
         interests of a child in different ways,  it  is  important  to  ask
         oneself the right questions in an orderly manner in order to  avoid
         the risk that the best interests of a child  might  be  undervalued
         when other important considerations were in play;
         (5) It is important to have a clear idea of a child's circumstances
         and of what is in a child's best interests before one asks  oneself
         whether those interests  are  outweighed  by  the  force  of  other
         considerations;
         (6) To that end there is no substitute for a careful examination of
         all relevant factors when the interests of a child are involved  in
         an article 8 assessment; and
         (7) A child must not be blamed for matters for which he or  she  is
         not responsible, such as the conduct of a parent."

19. The Zoumbas case did not concern citizen  children:   the  parents  and
    children were all citizens of the Republic of  Congo  and  were  to  be
    removed together as a family unit.  At paragraphs [24]-[25] of Zoumbas,
    Lord Hodge said this:

         "24. There is no irrationality in the conclusion that it was in the
         children's best interests to go with their parents to the  Republic
         of Congo. No doubt it would have been possible to have stated that,
         other things being equal, it was  in  the  best  interests  of  the
         children that they and their parents stayed in the  United  Kingdom
         so that  they  could  obtain  such  benefits  as  health  care  and
         education which the decision-maker recognised might be of a  higher
         standard than would be available in the  Congo.  But  other  things
         were not equal. They were not British citizens. They had  no  right
         to future education and health care in this country. They were part
         of a close-knit family with highly educated parents and were of  an
         age when their emotional needs could only be fully met  within  the
         immediate family unit. Such integration as had occurred into United
         Kingdom society would have been predominantly  in  the  context  of
         that family unit. Most significantly, the decision-maker  concluded
         that they could be removed to the Republic of Congo in the care  of
         their parents without serious detriment  to  their  well-being.  We
         agree with Lady Dorrian's succinct summary of the position in  para
         18 of the Inner House's opinion.

         25.  ... It was legitimate for the decision-maker  to  ask  herself
         first whether it  would  have  been  proportionate  to  remove  the
         parents if they had no children and then, in considering  the  best
         interests of the children  in  the  proportionality  exercise,  ask
         whether their well-being altered that provisional balance. When one
         has regard to the age of the children, the  nature  and  extent  of
         their integration into United Kingdom  society,  the  close  family
         unit in which they  lived  and  their  Congolese  citizenship,  the
         matters on which Mr Lindsay relied did not  create  such  a  strong
         case for the children that  their  interest  in  remaining  in  the
         United Kingdom could have outweighed the  considerations  on  which
         the  decision-maker  relied  in  striking  the   balance   in   the
         proportionality exercise (paras 17 and 18 above). The assessment of
         the children's best interests must be read in the  context  of  the
         decision letter as a whole."

20. In the Supreme Court judgment in ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4, at [32]-[33] in the opinion of  Lady
    Hale, the Supreme Court emphasised the importance for citizen  children
    of growing up in the country of their citizenship:

         "32.          Nor should the intrinsic importance of citizenship be
         played down. As citizens these children have rights which they will
         not be able to exercise if they move to another country. They  will
         lose the advantages of growing up and being educated in  their  own
         country, their own culture and their own language. They  will  have
         lost all this when they come back as adults.  As  Jacqueline  Bhaba
         (in 'The "Mere Fortuity of Birth"? Children, Mothers,  Borders  and
         the  Meaning  of  Citizenship',  in  Migrations   and   Mobilities:
         Citizenship, Borders and Gender (2009), edited  by  Seyla  Benhabib
         and Judith Resnik, at p 193) has put it:

             'In short, the fact of belonging to  a  country  fundamentally
             affects the manner of exercise of a child's family and private
             life,  during  childhood  and  well  beyond.   Yet   children,
             particularly young children, are often considered parcels that
             are easily movable  across  borders  with  their  parents  and
             without particular cost to the children.'

         33.      We now have a much greater understanding of the importance
         of these issues in assessing the overall well-being of  the  child.
         In making the proportionality assessment under article 8, the  best
         interests of the child must be a primary consideration. This  means
         that they must  be  considered  first.  They  can,  of  course,  be
         outweighed by the cumulative effect  of  other  considerations.  In
         this case, the  countervailing  considerations  were  the  need  to
         maintain firm  and  fair  immigration  control,  coupled  with  the
         mother's appalling immigration history and  the  precariousness  of
         her position when family life was created.  But,  as  the  Tribunal
         rightly pointed out, the children were not to be blamed  for  that.
         And the inevitable result of removing their primary carer would  be
         that they had to leave with her. On the facts, it is  as  least  as
         strong a case as Edore v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         [2003] 1 WLR 2979, where Simon Brown LJ held that "there really  is
         only room for one view" (para  26).  In  those  circumstances,  the
         Secretary of State was clearly right to concede that there could be
         only one answer."

21. The decision of the Upper Tribunal in Sanade in February 2012  predates
    the  introduction  of  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph  276ADE  into   the
    Immigration Rules.  There was then no  codification  of  Article  8  in
    United Kingdom law.  The guidance given in Sanade, so far as it relates
    to the factual matrix here, is at paragraph 6 of the judicial headnote:

         " 6. Where in the context of Article 8 one parent ("the  remaining
         parent") of a British citizen child is also a British  citizen  (or
         cannot be removed as a family member or in their  own  right),  the
         removal of the other parent does not mean that either the child  or
         the remaining parent will be required to leave, thereby  infringing
         the Zambrano principle, see C-256/11  Murat  Dereci.  The  critical
         question is whether the child is  dependent  on  the  parent  being
         removed for the exercise  of  his  Union  right  of  residence  and
         whether removal of that  parent  will  deprive  the  child  of  the
         effective exercise of residence in the United Kingdom or  elsewhere
         in the Union."

22. In Azimi-Moayed in 2013, the Upper Tribunal gave  further  guidance  on
    the position of children, summarised in the judicial headnote thus:

         "Decisions affecting children

          (1)  The case  law  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  identified  the
         following principles to assist  in  the  determination  of  appeals
         where children are affected by the appealed decisions:
             i)      As a starting point it is in  the  best  interests  of
             children to be with both their parents and if both parents are
             being removed from the United Kingdom then the starting  point
             suggests that so should dependent children who  form  part  of
             their household unless there are reasons to the contrary.
             ii)    It is generally in the interests of  children  to  have
             both  stability  and  continuity  of  social  and  educational
             provision and the benefit of growing up in the cultural  norms
             of the society to which they belong.
             iii)  Lengthy residence in a country other than the  state  of
             origin  can  lead  to  development  of  social  cultural   and
             educational ties that it would be inappropriate to disrupt, in
             the absence of compelling reason to the contrary. What amounts
             to lengthy residence is not clear cut  but  past  and  present
             policies have identified seven years as a relevant period.
             iv)   Apart from the terms of published  policies  and  rules,
             the Tribunal notes that  seven years from age four  is  likely
             to be more significant to a child that the first  seven  years
             of life. Very young children are  focussed  on  their  parents
             rather than their peers and are adaptable.
             v)     Short periods of residence, particularly  ones  without
             leave or the reasonable  expectation  of  leave  to  enter  or
             remain, while claims are promptly considered, are unlikely  to
             give rise to private life deserving of respect in the  absence
             of exceptional  factors.  In  any  event,  protection  of  the
             economic well-being of society amply justifies removal in such
             cases."

23. The remaining three cases on which the  appellant  relied  concern  the
    proper approach to Article 8 after July 2012.   The  conclusion  of  Mr
    Justice Sales (as he then  was)  in  Nagre  was  that  in  relation  to
    deportation, the post-July 2012 Rules constituted a complete code  such
    that only in  exceptional  or  compassionate  circumstances  would  the
    respondent be required to grant leave to remain  outside the Rules.

24. That approach was followed by the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Gulshan,  which
    summarised the state of the  authorities  as  at  December  2013.   The
    judicial headnote says this:

         "On the current state of the authorities:

              (a)    the maintenance requirements of E-LTRP.3.1-3.2 stand,
             although Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said
             that they could constitute an unjustified and disproportionate
             interference with the ability of spouses to live together;  he
             suggested that an appropriate figure may  be  around  �13,400,
             and highlighted the position of  young  people  and  low  wage
             earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;
             (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules,  only  if
             there may be arguably  good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to
             remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes  to
             go on to consider whether there are  compelling  circumstances
             not sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the  application
             of) Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]
             EWHC 720 (Admin);
             (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions  such
             as Section EX.1 are not  obstacles  which  are  impossible  to
             surmount: MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  393
             (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013]  UKUT  45  (IAC);
             they concern the practical possibilities of relocation. In the
             absence of such insurmountable obstacles, it is  necessary  to
             show other non-standard and particular features  demonstrating
             that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

         The Secretary of State addressed the Article 8  family  aspects  of
         the respondent's position through the Rules, in particular EX1, and
         the private life aspects through paragraph 276ADE. The judge should
         have done likewise, also paying attention to the Guidance. Thus the
         judge should have considered the Secretary  of  State's  conclusion
         under EX.1 that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  preventing
         the continuation of the family life outside the UK. Only  if  there
         were arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the
         rules was it necessary for him for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to
         consider  whether   there   were   compelling   circumstances   not
         sufficiently recognised under the Rules."

25. In Zhang, Mr Justice Turner sitting in the Administrative Court decided
    that the rule that a person with limited leave to remain in the UK  had
    to leave and re-apply to return and remain as a spouse was likely to be
    a disproportionate interference with the Article 8 rights of  the  vast
    majority of ordinary cases. Turner J said that this could not be  cured
    by an applicant asking the SSHD to exercise a  discretion  outside  the
    Rules.  He declined to strike down rule 319C(h)(i) but disapplied it to
    the applicant before him.

26. Finally, in MM (Lebanon),  published on 11  July  2014,  the  Court  of
    Appeal considered the position of three settled husbands  (two  British
    citizens and a refugee with indefinite  leave  to  remain)  whose  non-
    citizen spouses were not settled in the United Kingdom.   None  of  the
    couples could meet the new �18600 income  requirement.   The  Court  of
    Appeal considered Gulshan, Nagre, and Zhang in analysing  the  legality
    of that requirement.

27. The paragraphs in the judgment of Lord Justice Aikens which are  relied
    upon by the appellant in this case, [128] and [129], do not  form  part
    of the ratio decidendi of MM  (Lebanon).   At  paragraphs  [132]-[134],
    Aikens LJ summarises the legal position thus:

         "132.  What is the  upshot  of  all  these  decisions?  First,  the
         Secretary of State plainly is  under  a  common  law  duty  not  to
         promulgate an IR that is discriminatory, manifestly unjust, made in
         bad faith or involves "such oppressive or  gratuitous  interference
         with the  rights  of  those  subject  to  them  as  could  find  no
         justification  in  the  minds  of  reasonable  men".  If  she  does
         promulgate such an IR, it can be struck down or the offending  part
         can be severed. Secondly, I think that Huang, Baiai, Quila and Bibi
         all support the proposition that it is the duty of the Secretary of
         State to formulate an IR in a way that means that even if  it  does
         interfere with a relevant Convention right, it has to be capable of
         doing so in a manner which is not  inherently  disproportionate  or
         inherently unfair. Otherwise it will not be "rational", or it could
         be stigmatised  as  being  "arbitrary"  or  objectionable",  or  be
         characterised  as  being  "arbitrary  and  unjust".   Thirdly,  the
         analysis of the Supreme Court in Quila and of this  Court  in  Bibi
         make it clear that if  the  relevant  IR  is  challenged  as  being
         contrary to a Convention right, then the Huang  tests  have  to  be
         applied. The only difference, when  it  is  an  IR  that  is  being
         challenged in principle, as opposed  to  an  individual  Article  8
         decision, is  that  the  "proportionality"  questions  have  to  be
         considered in principle. In that case, it seems to me the test must
         be whether, assuming the relevant IR  constitutes  an  interference
         with a Convention right, the IR and its application  to  particular
         cases, would be inherently disproportionate or unfair. Another  way
         of putting the test  is  whether  the  IR  is  incapable  of  being
         proportionate and so is inherently unjustified.

         133.     Where does that  leave  the  statements  made  in  the  AM
         (Ethiopia),  Pankina  and  Nagre  line  of  cases,  viz.  that  the
         Secretary of State's duty is to protect an  immigrant's  Convention
         rights whether or not that is done through the medium of the IRs so
         that "it follows that the Rules are not of themselves  required  to
         guarantee compliance with the [relevant Article]".[  I  think  that
         the reconciliation must be along the following lines:  first,  Laws
         LJ was dealing with the principles of construction of IRs. IRs  are
         not to be construed upon the presumption that they  will  guarantee
         compliance with the relevant Convention right. Secondly, therefore,
         a particular IR does not,  in  each  case,  have  to  result  in  a
         person's Convention rights  being  "guaranteed".  In  a  particular
         case, an IR may  result  in  a  person's  Convention  rights  being
         interfered  with  in  a  manner  which  is  not  proportionate   or
         justifiable on the facts of that case. That will not  make  the  IR
         unlawful.  But  if  the  particular  IR  is  one  which,  being  an
         interference with the relevant Convention right, is also  incapable
         of being applied in a manner which is proportionate or  justifiable
         or is disproportionate in all (or nearly all  cases),  then  it  is
         unlawful.

         134.   Where  the  relevant  group  of  IRs,  upon   their   proper
         construction, provide a "complete code" for dealing with a person's
         Convention rights in the context of a particular  IR  or  statutory
         provision, such as in the case of  "foreign  criminals",  then  the
         balancing exercise and the way the various factors are to be  taken
         into account in an individual case must be done in accordance  with
         that code, although references to  "exceptional  circumstances"  in
         the code will nonetheless entail a proportionality exercise. But if
         the relevant group of IRs is not such a "complete  code"  then  the
         proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided  by  the
         Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law."

Discussion

28. The judge in the  present  appeal  did  not  have  the  benefit  of  MM
    (Lebanon) when preparing his decision.  He did consider the guidance in
    Azimi-Moayed  and  apply  the  Nagre/Gulshan  approach.   He  addressed
    himself briefly to Zhang and Gulshan at  paragraphs  [24]-[25],  albeit
    without reaching a conclusion as to whether they are  compatible.    He
    failed, however, to place any weight at  all  on  the  British  citizen
    status of the child, save to note it at paragraph  23.   Crucially,  he
    failed to address the approach of Lady Hale in ZH (Tanzania).   He  did
    not make any finding as to whether, in the context of a marriage  where
    one spouse is settled and the other  not,  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE  constitute  a  complete  code  such  that  the  exceptional  or
    compassionate circumstances approach in  Nagre  and  Gulshan  might  be
    ousted and Article 8 applied as it was before July 2012.

29. The judge found as a fact that settlement applications from India  take
    sixty days to process.  He considered that the appellant  could  either
    take her child with her, or make  alternative  arrangements,  for  that
    short period, while she applied to rejoin her  United  Kingdom  partner
    from India.  In reality, the appellant could not be expected to leave a
    four month old child in the United Kingdom with her husband.   At  that
    age, the mother is the child's principal carer and it follows  that  at
    the date of hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, in  order  for  the
    appellant to be removed to India it would have been necessary  for  her
    citizen child to be deprived of the benefit of growing up in the United
    Kingdom, for however long it might take her to get entry  clearance  to
    return and rejoin her partner in the United Kingdom.

30. It is unclear on what basis such  a  settlement  application  would  be
    made:  the appellant is still married to her  Indian  husband  and  has
    three children with him.  She is not free to marry her  United  Kingdom
    partner and therefore cannot apply to enter as his spouse  or  fianc�e.
    It might well take significantly longer for her to sort out her marital
    affairs and be in a position to make an application within the Rules to
    rejoin her partner here, particularly since the  accepted  evidence  is
    that she does not know where in India her husband  and  three  children
    from her marriage are living.

31. The failure to give weight to the young age and British citizenship  of
    the baby does amount to a material error of  law.   This  determination
    must be set aside and remade and at the hearing  I  indicated  that  it
    would be necessary for there to be a further oral  hearing,  since  the
    child is now approximately one year  old.   I  considered  that  to  be
    necessary principally because of the insertion  of  Part  5A  into  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on 28 July 2014 by s.19  of
    the Immigration Act 2014.   The determination will therefore be  remade
    in the First-tier Tribunal  at  the  Birmingham  hearing  centre  on  8
    October 2014.



Directions

32. The appellant has leave to file amended grounds of appeal dealing  with
    part 5A (limited to four A4 pages), within 7  days  of  receiving  this
    decision.

33. The respondent may serve and file a Reply to any such  amended  grounds
    (limited to four A4 pages), if so advised, within 21 days thereafter.

34. Any other relevant directions for the  remaking  of  the  determination
    will be made by the Birmingham Hearing Centre.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point  of  law.   I  set  aside  the  decision.  The
decision will be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.
