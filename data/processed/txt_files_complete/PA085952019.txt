Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Spurling, Counsel instructed by Barnes Harrild &
Dyer
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                CONSENT ORDER

   1. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
      2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:



        a. Upon the parties agreeing that the decision of First-Tier
           Tribunal Judge Page promulgated on 22 April 2020 discloses a
           material error of law and should be set aside.




        b. And upon the parties agreeing that the appeal should be remitted
           to the First-tier Tribunal.



        c. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for legal
           error and the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to
           be made afresh by a different judge with no findings preserved.



   2. I make the observation that, pursuant to a consent order dated 16
      February 2021, SMO, KSP & IM (Article 15(c); identity documents) Iraq
      CG [2019] UKUT 00400 (IAC) was remitted by the Court of Appeal to the
      Upper Tribunal in respect of a finding that is relevant to this
      appeal. It may be appropriate for this appeal to not be heard until
      the SMO decision in the Upper Tribunal is promulgated. However, this
      is entirely a matter for the First-tier Tribunal.
