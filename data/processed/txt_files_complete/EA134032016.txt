Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Waheed, counsel, instructed by BWF solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan on 10th December 2018, Mr T Melvin on

                    Officers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of  Ms  Donkor  against  a  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Neville  who  for  reasons  set  out  in  a   decision
    promulgated  on  29  March  2018  dismissed  her  appeal  against   the
    respondent's decision to refuse to grant her a permanent residence card
    under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

    Error of law - (decision given ex tempore)

2.   The application had been made on two bases.  First of all that she  was
    a divorcee but had retained her rights of residence and  secondly  that
    in any event she was entitled to a permanent residence card because she
    had completed five years' residence in  the  UK  with  her  partner  in
    accordance with the Regulations.  The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  found
    that the appellant and her husband had not actually been  divorced  and
    therefore the issue of obtaining permanent residence through that route
    was not applicable.  That decision  has  not  been  challenged  by  the
    Secretary of State.

3.   The significant issue in this case is whether or  not  the  appellant's
    husband was exercising treaty rights for the five years  prior  to  the
    decision.  Reliance is placed on his schedule of  work.   He  is  self-
    employed and there was no challenge or dispute that he had  earned  and
    paid taxes on the sums that he had given evidence of.  During 2010/2011
    he earned �5,400, 2011/2012  he  earned  �3,535,  2012/2013  he  earned
    �8,100, 2013/2014 �1,100, 2014/2015 �14,540 and 2015/2016 �17,746.  The
    appellant and  her  husband  had  each  been  granted  their  residence
    certificates in 2010.  Five years therefore ran from that first year of
    self-employed earnings of �5,400  through  to  the  2015/2016  year  of
    �17,746.

4.   Mr Tufan submitted that for the year  2013  to  2014  the  earnings  of
    �1,100 were neither effective nor adequate to amount  to  self-employed
    earnings.  It is correct that during the first two  years  the  sponsor
    earned less than �6,000 per annum and in the third year he earned  over
    �8,000.  Mr Waheed submitted that the earnings  had  to  be  looked  at
    overall and that in a good year somebody could, as  he  puts  it,  take
    their foot off the pedal and have a bit of a  relaxing  time  and  just
    work a little bit but that when looked at overall the sponsor  was,  in
    the period leading up to 2014, earning enough.  He had earned over that
    four year period some �17,000 or �18,000.  In the third  year  of  that
    period he had earned just slightly less than he had earned the previous
    two years and therefore when those figures are taken  into  account  it
    was apparent when looked at overall that the sponsor was  self-employed
    and his earnings were effective and appropriate.  They  were  not  what
    could be called pin money.

5.   One of the difficulties however is that the bank  statements  that  had
    been produced to the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  include  the  bank
    statements for the year 2013/2014  save  for  February  2013  where  he
    starts January with a balance in  his  account  of  �851.63  and  on  4
    February ends up with �921.63, having had one deposit  of  �300  during
    that time.  The next bank statement starts on 17 April  2014  where  he
    shows having a balance of �67.96.  So, during two and a half months  he
    seems to have spent some �850.

6.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge  in  his  decision  was  concerned  about
    those  earnings.   He  says  in  paragraph  18  that  it   demands   an
    explanation.  He refers to the lack of bank statements for that  period
    of time, but he says that given the omission of  those  statements  and
    the lack of any evidence from the sponsor to explain his  low  earnings
    in that year he could not be satisfied that the appellant had satisfied
    her burden of proof.   The  decision,  he  says,  was  put  before  the
    applicant and those evidential deficiencies were apparent to  her.   He
    goes on to say that the Tribunal is entitled to attribute  significance
    to her failure to meet those deficiencies.  Whether  that  is  strictly
    correct or not is actually not the point.  The fact is that looking  at
    the figures of earnings between 2011 and 2014  the  sponsor  cannot  be
    said to have been earning effective earnings  that  would  prevent  him
    from needing to show some other source of income to  be  able  to  show
    that he was exercising his treaty rights.

7.   On that basis, I am satisfied that the decision of  the  respondent  to
    dismiss the appeal is not infected by an error of law.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal was justified in dismissing the appeal on the grounds that the
    sponsor had not shown that he was exercising treaty rights for the five
    years in question such that the appellant could claim to be entitled to
    a permanent residence card.

8.   The other ground of appeal upon which permission  was  granted  however
    was that the First-tier Tribunal Judge ought, in  accordance  with  MDB
    and Others (Article 12, 1612/68) [2010] UKUT 161  have  considered  not
    only whether the appellant was entitled  to  permanent  residence,  but
    also whether she was entitled to a  residence  card.   The  grounds  of
    appeal quote from paragraph 44 of MDB and say "where the decision is  a
    refusal to issue a permanent residence card that  may  necessitate,  in
    the event that  refusal  is  found  correct,  considering  whether  the
    appellant was entitled nonetheless to an extended right of  residence".
    And then goes on to say that even though MDB would not have had  enough
    time to qualify for permanent  residence  it  would  have  sufficed  to
    qualify them for an extended right of residence under Regulation 14(2).
     That of course was the old Regulations.

9.   Mr Tufan makes the point that there has not been an application for  an
    extended right of residence and that is correct.  It is therefore quite
    possible that this appellant could not have had her application for  an
    extended right of residence considered in the appeal  that  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal but in the light of MDB, which has not  so  far
    as I know  been  overturned  by  anything  subsequent  to  2010,  I  am
    satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did err in law in  failing
    to consider whether on the basis of the evidence that was in  front  of
    him at that time the appellant was entitled to a residence card.

10.  Of course the position has moved on now and so  although  I  set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal insofar as the judge failed  to
    reach a decision on whether she was entitled to a residence card,  some
    two years have now passed and whether the appellant's sponsor is or  is
    not currently exercising treaty rights is a matter for evidence  as  of
    today.

11.  In the circumstances therefore I have  considered  whether  or  not  to
    remit this to the First-tier Tribunal for further evidence to be  taken
    or whether to retain this before me and grant leave to the appellant to
    file and serve further evidence  on  where  the  sponsor  is  currently
    living and whether he is currently exercising treaty rights and so  for
    that reason I will remit it to be heard before me on 14 January.

12.  The appellant has leave to file and serve such further evidence as  she
    wishes to rely on, such evidence to be filed by Monday 31 December.

    Remaking the decision on 14th January 2018

13.  The appellant filed a bundle of  documents  including  wage  slips  and
    bank statements. Mr Melvin confirmed that no issue was taken with their
    genuineness. He  made  no  submissions  but  invited  the  Tribunal  to
    consider the documents and make a decision on whether the appellant was
    entitled to a residence card on the basis of the documents.

14.  I have considered the documents. No adverse matters were  drawn  to  my
    attention. I am satisfied the appellant meets the requirements  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 for the issue  of
    a residence card.

15.  I allow the appeal.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it such as to find the
    appellant meets the EEA Regulations for the grant of a residence card.
