                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is citizen of Portugal. His date of birth is 30 May 1997.



 2. On 1 March 2018 the Secretary of State made a deportation order against
    the Appellant  pursuant  to  Regulation  23(6)(b)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the 2016 Regulations").  On
    22 May 2017 (8  days  before  his  20th  birthday)  the  Appellant  was
    sentenced  to  30  months  imprisonment  for  the  following  offences;
    possession of cocaine with intent to supply, possession of heroin  with
    intent to supply, possession of an offensive weapon  and  assaulting  a
    police officer.  The offences were committed on  30  March  2017.   The
    Appellant was released on licence on 5 July 2018. However, he  remained
    in immigration detention until 10 October 2018. His licence expires  on
    5 October 2019.

 3. The Appellant appealed against the deportation  order  on  the  grounds
    that the decision breached EU law.  His appeal came  before  FtT  Judge
    Gurung-Thapa on 5 December 2018.  The  judge  allowed  the  Appellant's
    appeal under the 2016 Regulations.  The Secretary of State was  granted
    permission to appeal by Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins on 6  March  2019.
    Thus, the matter came before me. I set aside the decision  of  the  FTT
    having found a material error of law.  I found that the FTT did not err
    in respect of the finding that the Appellant  had  permanent  residence
    and the level of protection that this entitles him to  under  the  2016
    Regulation. However, I found that  there  was  a  material  error  when
    assessing the risk posed by the Appellant. The error  of  law  decision
    reads as follows:-

         "22. The Secretary of State's application is  that  when  assessing
             risk the judge did not take into account material matters  and
             the decision is inadequately reasoned.  I  had  some  sympathy
             with  Ms  Jaja's  helpful  submissions.   The  judge  properly
             directed herself.  It is not clear why the Secretary of  State
             failed to obtain a risk assessment or  why  evidence  of  some
             importance was served on the day of the hearing.  However,  in
             my view, the judge did not take into account the nature of the
             offences that were committed by  the  Appellant  and  did  not
             consider risk in the light of the Appellant's criminal record.
              There  had,  on  the  face  of  it,  been  an  escalation  in
             seriousness of the offences and I do not accept that the judge
             adequately engaged with this point at [55].  The  judge  found
             that the Appellant was genuinely remorseful and  that  he  was
             motivated  to  avoid  further  offending.   She  accepted  the
             Appellant's evidence unquestioningly.  She was entitled to  do
             so; however, she erred  because  she  did  not  give  adequate
             reasons.  There was  no  independent  supporting  evidence  of
             remorse.  Whilst the judge was entitled to  attach  weight  to
             the sentencing remarks of the judge about the Appellant having
             been under pressure, when one considers remorse in the context
             of   the   Appellant's   criminality   including   the   three
             adjudications against him (which he accepted), it is difficult
             to understand from the judge's decision why she found that  he
             was remorseful and motivated.  Although the Appellant may have
             taken steps to start rehabilitative work  whilst  in  custody,
             the evidential value of this was limited because  he  did  not
             undergo rehabilitative work relating to  offending  whilst  in
             prison.  The evidence of "rehabilitative work" referred to  by
             the judge at [71] can only relate to other  courses  that  the
             Appellant completed whilst in custody which were not  directly
             related to risk or criminality.

         23.  The judge attached weight to the  Appellant  being  supervised
             whilst on licence and that he would have the  support  of  his
             mother and elder brother.  Whilst she was entitled  to  attach
             weight to their evidence about the impact  of  prison  on  the
             family, it is not clear from the decision how this  materially
             undermined the presentation of  risk,  in  the  light  of  the
             failure of his family to give him  effective  support  in  the
             past.  The Appellant may be supervised whilst on licence which
             expires on 5 October 2019; however, he had been released  only
             six weeks before the hearing.  It is difficult to see how  any
             inference as to  risk  could  be  gleaned  from  this.   I  am
             concerned that the judge took into account immaterial matters;
             namely, the prospect of rehabilitation  in  Portugal  and  the
             length of time the Appellant  has  been  here.   This  may  be
             material  when  assessing  proportionality,   but   not   when
             assessing risk.

         24.  Whilst the Secretary of State had produced evidence  (the  CID
             notes relating to  incidents  that  had  occurred  during  the
             Appellant's time in custody) on the day of the hearing,  there
             was no application for an adjournment.  Whilst the  judge  was
             entitled to accept the Appellant's  evidence  on  the  matters
             disclosed in this evidence, it was incumbent on the  judge  to
             give adequate reasons for doing so.  The reason given  by  the
             judge is "there  was  a  ring  of  truth  in  the  Appellant's
             explanation".  This is not adequate, in my view."

 4. I directed that the Respondent serve and file a probation  report/OASys
    assessment    relating to this Appellant not later than 21 days  before
    the hearing. Whilst acknowledging that the burden of proof  is  on  the
    Respondent, considering  that  he  was  still   on  licence  and  under
    supervision of a probation officer, I decided that it  was   reasonable
    to expect him to produce an up-to-date assessment of risk and  directed
    that he did so no later than 21 days before the hearing.

The Law

 5. Regulation 27 of the 2016 Regulations reads as follows:-

         '27. (1) In this regulation, a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
             decision  taken  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health.

             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.

             (3)  A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
             person with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
             except  on  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  and   public
             security.

             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                  period of  at  least  ten  years  prior  to  the  relevant
                  decision; or

                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                  is in the best  interests  of  the  person  concerned,  as
                  provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the  Child
                  adopted by the General Assembly of the United  Nations  on
                  20th November 1989(17).

             (5)  The public policy and public security requirements of the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                  proportionality;

                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;

                  (f)  the decision may be taken  on  preventative  grounds,
                  even in the absence of  a  previous  criminal  conviction,
                  provided the grounds are specific to the person.

             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
             public policy and public security  in  relation  to  a  person
             ("P") who is resident in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision
             maker must take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,
             state of health, family  and  economic  situation  of  P,  P's
             length of residence in the  United  Kingdom,  P's  social  and
             cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of
             P's links with P's country of origin.

             (7)  In the case of a relevant decision taken  on  grounds  of
             public health-

                  (a)  a disease that does not have  epidemic  potential  as
                  defined by the relevant instruments of  the  World  Health
                  Organisation or is not a disease listed in Schedule  1  to
                  the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010(18);
                  or

                  (b)  if the person concerned is in the United Kingdom, any
                  disease occurring after the three month  period  beginning
                  on the date on which the  person  arrived  in  the  United
                  Kingdom,

             does not constitute grounds for the decision.

             (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the  requirements
             of this regulation are met must (in particular) have regard to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations  of
             public policy, public security and the  fundamental  interests
             of society etc.)[1].'

 6. In SSHD v  Straszewski  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1245  the  court  of  appeal
    considered factors to be taken into account when deciding  whether  the
    removal of an EEA national  who  has  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence is justified on serious grounds of public  policy  or  public
    security. The court considered deportation in the context of  the  2006
    EEA Regulations and said as follows:

         "12. One important purpose of  the  Citizenship  Directive  was  to
         protect and support the Treaty right of free movement of  nationals
         of Member States and, by extension, nationals of other EEA  states.
         The origin and purpose of  the  Regulations  are,  therefore,  both
         fundamentally different from those of section 32 of the UK  Borders
         Act, which is directed to removing from  this  country  aliens  who
         have no right to be here other than in  accordance  with  leave  to
         remain granted by the Secretary of State.  Leaving  aside  whatever
         protection against removal the European Convention on Human  Rights
         may afford them, their position in law is  inherently  less  secure
         than that of EEA nationals who  are  entitled  to  exercise  Treaty
         rights. In a case where the removal of an EEA national would  prima
         facie interfere with the exercise of his Treaty rights  it  is  for
         the member state to justify its action. It is for this reason  that
         I am unable to accept Ms Chan's submission that in a  case  of  the
         present kind the burden of showing that  the  decision  is  not  in
         accordance with the law lies on the person who is to be deported.

         13.  Given the fundamental difference between the  position  of  an
         alien  and  that  of  an  EEA  national,  one  would  expect   that
         interference with the permanent right of residence would be subject
         to  more  stringent  restrictions  than  those  which  govern   the
         deportation of nationals of other states. Moreover, since the right
         of free movement is regarded as a fundamental aspect of the  Union,
         it is not surprising that  the  Court  of  Justice  has  held  that
         exceptions to that right based on public policy are to be construed
         restrictively: see, for example Van Duyn v Home Office (Case 41/71)
         [1975] 1 C.M.L.R. 1 and Bonsignore v  Oberstadtdirektor  der  Stadt
         K�ln (Case 67/74) [1975] 1 C.M.L.R. 472.

         14.  Regulation 21(5)(b) and (d) provide that a decision to  remove
         an EEA national who enjoys a permanent right of residence  must  be
         based exclusively on the personal conduct of the  person  concerned
         and that matters that do not directly relate to the particular case
         or which relate to considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not
         justify a decision to remove him. On the  face  of  it,  therefore,
         deterrence, in the sense of measures designed to deter others  from
         committing similar offences, has of itself no part  to  play  in  a
         decision to  remove  the  individual  offender.  Similarly,  it  is
         difficult to see how a desire to reflect public  revulsion  at  the
         particular offence can  properly  have  any  part  to  play,  save,
         perhaps, in exceptionally serious cases. As far  as  deterrence  is
         concerned,  the  CJEU  has   held   as   much   in   Bonsignore   v
         Oberstadtdirektor der Stadt K�ln.

         ...

         22.  Our attention was not drawn to any case in which the CJEU  has
         considered the kind of conduct that is likely  to  be  sufficiently
         serious to justify deportation of an  EEA  national  who  enjoys  a
         permanent right of residence but has not lived in the member  state
         concerned for a period of at least ten years. Ms Chan did, however,
         draw our attention to the decision in I v  Oberb�rgermeisterin  der
         Stadt Remscheid, in  which  the  claimant  had  been  convicted  of
         multiple offences of sexual abuse, sexual coercion and rape of a 14
         year old girl in respect of which  he  had  been  sentenced  to  7�
         years' imprisonment. The CJEU  was  asked  to  decide  whether  the
         expression "imperative grounds of public security" referred only to
         conduct which threatened the security  of  the  state  itself,  its
         population and the survival of its institutions or was  broader  in
         scope.

         23.  In giving its judgment the court emphasised that member states
         retain the freedom to determine the requirements of  public  policy
         and public security in accordance with their  national  needs,  but
         that the requirements of the Directive must  still  be  interpreted
         strictly. Criminal offences which constitute a particularly serious
         threat to one of the fundamental interests of society or which pose
         a  direct  threat  to  the  calm  and  physical  security   of  the
         population may  fall  within  the  concept  of  "imperative  public
         security", as long as  the  manner  in  which  such  offences  were
         committed discloses particularly serious characteristics.  However,
         the court also emphasised that even then deportation  will  not  be
         justified unless the conduct of the person concerned  represents  a
         genuine, present threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
         of society, which normally implies that he has a propensity to  act
         in the same way in the future (see paragraphs 17-30).

         24.  I do  not  find  that  case  to  be  of  great  assistance  in
         determining whether in any  individual  case  there  are  "serious"
         grounds of public policy or public security sufficient  to  justify
         deportation.  It  is  clear,  as  the  court  confirmed,  that  the
         expression "imperative  grounds  of  public  security"   creates  a
         considerably stricter test than  merely  "  serious"  grounds,  but
         since the application of the test is primarily for the member state
         concerned, which must take into account social conditions  as  well
         as the various factors to which the Directive  itself  refers,  the
         question is likely to turn to a  large  extent  on  the  particular
         facts of the case. It would therefore be unwise,  in  my  view,  to
         attempt to lay down guidelines. In the end, the Secretary of  State
         must give effect  to  the  Regulations  which  themselves  must  be
         interpreted against the background of the right  of  free  movement
         and the need to ensure  that  derogations  from  it  are  construed
         strictly. In that context it is worth noting that even  in  a  case
         where it is considered that removal is  prima  facie  justified  on
         imperative grounds of  public  security,  the  decision-maker  must
         consider, among other things, whether the offender has a propensity
         to re-offend in a similar way (judgment, paragraph 30)."

 7. The burden of proving that a person represents a genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society rests on the Secretary of State. The standard  of  proof  is
    the balance of probabilities:  Arranz (EEA Regulations - deportation  -
    test) [2017] UKUT 00294 (IAC)

The Evidence

 8. By way of  letter  dated  18  April  2019  the  Appellant's  solicitors
    submitted an OASys report dated 5 December 2018. It was completed on  9
    November 2018. The solicitors refer to a risk  assessment  having  been
    carried out in May 2019. No assessment was produced by either party.  I
    expressed my concern about the absence of such evidence. I was told  by
    both representatives that efforts  had  been  made  to  obtain  further
    evidence from the probation service.  These  efforts  had  been  to  no
    avail.  I was not given any further details of  the  attempts  made  by
    either party to obtain up to date evidence.  Neither party asked for an
    adjournment to obtain further evidence. Ms Jaja could not explain to me
    why the Appellant had not made a further witness  statement  which  may
    have assisted me to  make  an  up  to  date  assessment  of  risk.  The
    Appellant attended the hearing  with  his  mother.  He  relied  on  the
    evidence that was before the FTT and in addition the OASys  assessment.
    The matter proceeded by way of submissions only.

The OASys report

 9. The Appellant was subject to an  immediate  sentence  of  imprisonment.
    There was no pre-sentence report (PSR) as far as I am aware before  the
    sentencing judge. The OASys report was prepared after  the  Appellant's
    release. He had returned home and was living with his  family.  He  was
    supported by his mother.  He was unemployed because of his  immigration
    status.  He was released  on  licence  and  was  to  complete  "offence
    focused work" during supervision appointments. He was to be referred to
    a relevant agency by his offender  manager  to  reduce  the  risk.   He
    showed a willingness to participate in a "Thinking  Skills"  programme.
    At R11.12   it is stated that the Appellant is  "motivated  to  engage,
    and has shown willingness to partake in the Thinking Skills  programme,
    for which a referral has been made. He has accepted full responsibility
    for the offence and was able to identify what led him to committing the
    offence."

10. The author of the report describes the circumstances of  the  offences.
    The Appellant is said to have violently pushed a police officer  having
    been told that he would be searched for drugs. He was seen to  throw  a
    knife into the road. Whist in police custody he  swallowed  drugs.  The
    caused him to have a heart attack and to be taken to hospital.  He  was
    arrested with another male who was also charged with drug offences. The
    Appellant accepted responsibility for the offences.  He  accounted  for
    his criminal saying that it was as a result of his drug habit. There is
    a previous conviction for possession  of  a  knife.  According  to  the
    author of the reports this represented a pattern of offending and  that
    the offences represented a propensity to carry weapons.  There  was  an
    escalation in seriousness of the offending.  Educational and  financial
    issues were linked with offending as  were  lifestyle  and  associates.
    Drug use was also linked as was thinking and behaviour  and  attitudes.
    The Appellant presented a medium risk of reoffending and a medium  risk
    of harm to the public (and staff).  The risk of harm to members of  the
    public, himself and police officers is not  imminent.  The  risks  will
    increase if he returns to cannabis use, comes  into  contact  with  the
    police and associates with pro-criminal peers. The risk will be reduced
    if he is able to involve himself with  pro-social  activities  such  as
    training courses and if he were to gain employment and  if  he  engages
    during supervision sessions.

11. Whilst there is no suggestion that the Appellant has failed  to  comply
    with the conditions of his licence, there was no further evidence  from
    the probation service indicating the level of compliance and whether he
    has completed any courses and significantly no up to date assessment of
    risk.  The Appellant is still on licence.

The Evidence before the FTT

12. The Appellant  relied  on  the  bundle  before  the  FTT.  This  bundle
    comprises 253 pages and includes the Appellant's witness  statement  of
    the 18 July 2018.  It is his evidence that he came here 9 years ago. He
    attended  Newham   College   where   he   obtained   some   educational
    certificates,  copies  of  which  he  produced.    He   explained   his
    criminality by the saying that he had poor associates. He regretted his
    actions. He said that he was frightened  of  repercussions  if  he  had
    refused to deal in drugs.  He undertook several courses in  prison  and
    has gained further qualifications.

13. The Appellant's mother, [SS], also made  a  witness  statement.  It  is
    undated. Her evidence is that she has been here for 8 years  and  works
    as a cleaner. Prior to the Appellant's incarceration he was  living  in
    the family home.  There was an undated witness statement from [FD], the
    Appellant's brother. His evidence is that the Appellant has matured and
    changed. He has rehabilitated and "firmly resolved never  to  associate
    with the wrong people again". He has  learnt  lessons  from  the  past.
    There is a witness statement from the Appellant's aunt, [NS], dated  17
    July 2018. Her evidence is scant.

14. The Appellant, his mother and brother gave  oral  evidence  before  the
    FTT. The salient parts of the  evidence  are  that  the  Appellant  had
    "applied to be referred to the Thinking Skills Programme" and  was  not
    accepted because he was released.  He completed IT courses in  custody.
    He had enrolled on a City and Guilds Course which started at the end of
    January 2019. He told the FTT that he was a reformed  character.   Much
    of the Appellant's mother's evidence related to her status  here  as  a
    worker. The evidence in respect of the Appellant's  partner  [AS],  was
    not accepted by the  FTT.  It  was  not  accepted  that  he  was  in  a
    relationship. There was no challenge to this  finding  and  no  further
    evidence adduced before me on this issue.

Conclusions

15. Whilst I do not criticise the representatives who appeared  before  me,
    the Tribunal has not been assisted by either party in this case.  There
    was no up to date evidence of risk.  However, the OASys report  put  me
    in a better position than the FTT  to  evaluate  risk.   I  heard  full
    submissions from both parties. I shall engage with them  whilst  giving
    my reasons for concluding that in this case, having  conducted  a  fact
    sensitive assessment of the evidence before me, the Respondent has  not
    established the Appellant's conduct represents a genuine,  present  and
    serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interest of society and
    that there are no serious grounds of public policy of  public  security
    justifying  the deportation of the Appellant.

16. The offences committed by the Appellant  are  undoubtedly  serious.  He
    supplied class A drugs and assaulted a Police Officer in the  execution
    of duty. Mr Tufan did not try to persuade me that the this was  a  most
    exceptional  case  so  that  past  conduct  alone  may   suffice.   The
    Respondent's case was advanced on the basis that the Appellant posed  a
    future risk. Mr Tufan  said  that  he  is  a  persistent  offender.  He
    submitted that whilst for the purposes of the 2016 Regulations risk  of
    re-offending does not have to be imminent, in Mr Tufan's view there was
    probably an imminent risk in this case.  Mr Tufan relied  on  the  risk
    assessment in the OASys report and  addressed  me  in  some  detail  in
    respect of Schedule 1.

17. The thread going through the  evidence  of  the  Appellant  and  family
    members is that the sentence of imprisonment has served as  a  salutary
    experience for the Appellant. This is not surprising  in  my  view  and
    supported by what the sentencing judge  said.  The  Appellant  suffered
    heart failure following his arrest,  having  swallowed  a  quantity  of
    drugs. The sentencing judge stated that the Appellant nearly died as  a
    result.  He accepted that the Appellant was under extreme pressure  (to
    sell drugs), albeit this did not amount to an offence  of  duress.   He
    accepted that the Appellant who was  arrested  with  another  played  a
    lesser role. In respect of the supply of drugs, the starting point  was
    a custodial sentence of three years. He was  given  two  years,  having
    been given credit for pleading guilty.  In  the  light  of  a  previous
    conviction for  possession  of  a  blade  the  Appellant  was  given  a
    mandatory 6- month  sentence.  He  was  given  a  concurrent  3-  month
    sentence for assaulting a police officer.   Whilst the Appellant has  a
    previous conviction in 2015  for  possession  of  a  blade,  I  am  not
    satisfied that he is a persistent offender. He  was  not  sentenced  on
    this basis of him being a persistent  offender.   From  the  sentencing
    comments, it is clear that the judge did  not  consider  him  to  be  a
    persistent offender.  There is no  reason  for  me  to  go  behind  the
    comments of the sentencing judge. Mr Tufan did not ask me to do so.

18. Ms Jaja drew my attention to certificates  in  the  Appellant's  bundle
    which establish that the Appellant undertook courses whilst in custody.
    These were before the FTT. Contrary to the findings of the FTT, they do
    not amount to rehabilitative work; however, they do establish that  the
    Appellant kept  himself  busy  in  prison  and  successfully  undertook
    courses. In some, he achieved excellent results.  This  is  undoubtedly
    capable of helping him to find work in the future. It supports that the
    Appellant is motivated to find work.

19. Whilst there was no evidence  that  the  Appellant  has  completed  the
    Thinking Skills programme, there is a certificate  in  the  Appellant's
    bundle (p.36) to which I was not directed at the error of  law  hearing
    and which  the  FTT  did  not  refer  to.   It  is  a  "certificate  of
    completion" of a safeguarding course which comprised  four  units.  One
    unit is described as "coping with change" and another "managing  anger,
    aggression and stress". Whilst Mr  Tufan  correctly  pointed  out  that
    there was no evidence about what the  course  entailed  to  assess  its
    significance, it  is  capable  of  supporting  that  the  Appellant  is
    motivated to change. I consider the evidence in the round.

20. At the error of law hearing Ms Jaja told me that the evidence was  that
    the Appellant had signed up on the Thinking Skills programme whilst  in
    prison but was released before he was able to start.   From  the  OASys
    report it seems that he was required to complete the course  after  his
    release and while on licence. Regrettably there was no  evidence  about
    this before me. However, there is no suggestion that the Appellant  has
    failed to comply with the terms of licence or that  he  has  failed  to
    cooperate with the probation service since his release. He is still  on
    licence and has not been recalled. It can reasonably be  inferred  that
    he has cooperated with requirements including any  rehabilitation  work
    he has been required to undertake. I find that the assessment  of  risk
    of re-offending/ serious harm in the OASys report in November 2018,  is
    not sufficient in itself to justify deportation.  I  find  that  it  is
    reasonably likely that the risk has reduced since the assessment.  This
    would not only accord with the probability percentages in the report at
    R11.12, but such a conclusion  can  be  reasonably  inferred  from  the
    evidence and consideration  of  the  risk  factors  identified  in  the
    report.

21. At the hearing before  the  FTT,  the  Respondent  produced  CID  notes
    relating to incidents the Appellant was involved in whilst in prison. I
    did not have sight of these. Neither party was  able  to  produce  this
    evidence. In any event, Mr Tufan did not seek to directly rely  on  it.
    He accepted that the author of the OASys factored these incidents  into
    the assessment of risk. I am  unable  to  draw  conclusions  about  the
    evidence and make findings of  fact  about  the  circumstances  of  the
    incidents without having sight of the evidence. I am however  satisfied
    that there was evidence before the FTT pointing to the Appellant having
    a problem with authority and aggression  which  got  him  into  trouble
    whilst in prison. This would accord with the assessment of risk in  the
    OASys report. I take into account that in 2015 the Appellant received a
    community order for possession of a blade. He  failed  to  comply  with
    this. In addition,  he  has  been  convicted  of  assaulting  a  police
    officer. I  attach  significance  to  the  evidence  of  escalation  in
    offending identified in the OASys report.  These are all  matters  that
    weigh against the Appellant. However, they do not  present  a  complete
    picture.  I must consider all the evidence.

22. I attach some weight to the Appellant  having  not  re-offended  having
    also considered that he was released less than 12 months ago, and he is
    still on licence with the prospect of deportation hanging over him.

23. I must make an evaluation of the likelihood of the Appellant  offending
    and the consequences should he do so. I attach  significant  weight  to
    the OASys assessment of risk of  re-offending  and  serious  harm.   In
    addition, I consider the judge's sentencing comments and  the  evidence
    of the Appellant and family members. I have considered the risk factors
    identified in the OASys assessment.   The Appellant has gone  some  way
    to prepare himself for employment, having undergone courses  whilst  in
    custody. Whilst now dependent on his mother, he is  not  able  to  work
    because of his status.  There is no evidence that he is a drug user. At
    the time of the OASys assessment he had not relapsed and there  was  no
    evidence suggesting that he was currently taking  drugs.  No  doubt  if
    this was the case, he would have been recalled  to  prison.   I  accept
    that the Appellant now resides with his mother in Barking. Prior to his
    incarceration and when he committed the trigger  offences,  the  family
    was living in Newham.  These are matters which will, according  to  the
    OASys report, reduce risk.

24. I have had regard to the factors in Schedule 1.  I  am  satisfied  that
    there has been some rehabilitation. This  is  made  out  in  the  OASys
    report (R11.12). The Appellant  was  sentenced  to  a  medium  term  of
    imprisonment. He is not a persistent offender,  albeit  I  accept  some
    evidence of escalation in seriousness between the offence in  2015  and
    the trigger offences.   I  have  taken  into  account  the  fundamental
    interests of society and what they comprise (maintaining public  order,
    preventing social harm, tackling offences which cause wider social harm
    caused by the misuse of drugs and the need to protect  the  public).  I
    accept that the crimes  committed  by  the  Appellant  are  capable  of
    amounting to a threat to the fundamental interests of society,  subject
    to the level of risk presented by  the  Appellant.  In  this  case  the
    Respondent has not established that the threat is genuine, present  and
    sufficiently serious. The Respondent has not established that there are
    serious grounds of public  policy  justifying  deportation  under  2016
    Regulations.

25. The appeal is allowed under the 2016 EEA Regulations.


Signed            Joanna McWilliam                    Date 29 August 2019

Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam
-----------------------
  [1]    Considerations of public policy and public security
  1. The EU Treaties do not impose a uniform  scale  of  public  policy  or
  public security values:  member  States  enjoy  considerable  discretion,
  acting within the parameters  set  by  the  EU  Treaties,  applied  where
  relevant by the EEA agreement, to define their own  standards  of  public
  policy and public security, for purposes  tailored  to  their  individual
  contexts, from time to time.
  Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom
  2. An EEA national or  the  family  member  of  an  EEA  national  having
  extensive  familial  and  societal  links  with  persons  of   the   same
  nationality or language does not amount  to  integration  in  the  United
  Kingdom; a significant degree of wider cultural and societal  integration
  must be present before a person may be  regarded  as  integrated  in  the
  United Kingdom.
  3. Where an EEA national or the family member  of  an  EEA  national  has
  received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent  offender,  the  longer
  the sentence, or the more  numerous  the  convictions,  the  greater  the
  likelihood that the individual's continued presence in the United Kingdom
  represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat  affecting
  of the fundamental interests of society.
  4. Little weight is to be attached to the integration of an EEA  national
  or the family member of an EEA national within the United Kingdom if  the
  alleged integrating links were formed at or around the same time as-
    (a)  the commission of a criminal offence;
    (b)  an act otherwise affecting the fundamental interests of society;
    (c)  the EEA national or family  member  of  an  EEA  national  was  in
    custody.
  5. The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national or  the  family
  member of an EEA national who is able to provide substantive evidence  of
  not demonstrating a threat (for example, through demonstrating  that  the
  EEA national or the family member of an  EEA  national  has  successfully
  reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely to be proportionate.
  6. It is consistent with public policy and public  security  requirements
  in the United Kingdom that EEA decisions may be taken in order to refuse,
  terminate or withdraw any right otherwise conferred by these  Regulations
  in the case of abuse of rights or fraud, including-
    (a)  entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person to enter
    or to attempt to  enter,  a  marriage,  civil  partnership  or  durable
    partnership of convenience; or
    (b)  fraudulently obtaining  or  attempting  to  obtain,  or  assisting
    another to obtain or to attempt to obtain,  a  right  to  reside  under
    these Regulations.
  The fundamental interests of society
  7. For the purposes of these Regulations, the  fundamental  interests  of
  society in the United Kingdom include-
    (a)  preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of the immigration laws,
    and maintaining the integrity  and  effectiveness  of  the  immigration
    control system (including under these Regulations) and  of  the  Common
    Travel Area;
    (b)  maintaining public order;
    (c)  preventing social harm;
    (d)  preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;
    (e)  protecting public services;
    (f)  excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of  an  EEA
    national with a conviction (including where the conduct of that  person
    is likely to  cause,  or  has  in  fact  caused,  public  offence)  and
    maintaining  public  confidence  in  the  ability   of   the   relevant
    authorities to take such action;
    (g)  tackling offences  likely  to  cause  harm  to  society  where  an
    immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify but where there
    is wider societal harm (such as offences related to the misuse of drugs
    or crime with a cross-border dimension as mentioned in Article 83(1) of
    the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union);
    (h)  combating the effects of  persistent  offending  (particularly  in
    relation to offences, which if taken in  isolation,  may  otherwise  be
    unlikely to meet the requirements of regulation 27);
    (i)  protecting the rights and freedoms of  others,  particularly  from
    exploitation and trafficking;
    (j)  protecting the public;
    (k)  acting in the best interests of a child (including where doing  so
    entails refusing a child admission to the United Kingdom, or  otherwise
    taking an EEA decision against a child);
    (l)  countering terrorism and extremism and protecting shared values.
