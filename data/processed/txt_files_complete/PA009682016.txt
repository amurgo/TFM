Interpreter:  Miss Mehter


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity order.

 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan. She entered the United Kingdom
    most recently as a visitor on May 6, 2005. When she entered the  United
    Kingdom she had with her two children. Both children had been  born  in
    America and were therefore citizens of the United  States  of  America.
    Since being here she has also given birth to her youngest son.

 3. Shortly after being served with Form  IS  151A  as  an  overstayer  her
    husband applied for asylum on behalf of himself and their two sons  but
    he was refused by the respondent on March 26, 2010.

 4. She then made an application on family/private life grounds for limited
    leave to remain but this was refused on June 1, 2015.

 5. On October 22, 2015 the appellant lodged a protection and human  rights
    claim but this was refused by the respondent on January 15,  2016.  The
    appellant appealed that decision on February 1,  2016  and  her  appeal
    came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Williams on May  15,  2017
    and in a decision promulgated on June 14, 2017 the Judge dismissed  all
    her claims.

 6. Grounds of appeal were lodged on July 7, 2017 and Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Adio granted  permission  to  appeal  on  July  19,  2017
    identifying that the Judge had  erred  in  his  approach  to  paragraph
    276ADE HC 395 as he had  failed  to  have  regard  to  the  eldest  two
    children in his consideration.

 7. A rule 24 statement dated August 7, 2017 opposed  the  application  but
    when the matter came before me on the above date  Mr  McVeety  accepted
    that there was an error in law because firstly the Judge had  taken  as
    his starting point a decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Nicholson as his starting point, even though that decision was almost 6
    years old, and secondly; the Judge should have considered the  position
    of the two eldest children who had been in the United Kingdom for  over
    12 years when he heard  the  appeal.  The  failure  to  consider  their
    interests under the Immigration Rules was, he  conceded,  an  error  in
    law.

 8. Having considered the grounds of appeal and Mr McVeety's submissions  I
    agreed there was an error in law. Whilst a previous decision from  2011
    could be relevant to an asylum claim I was  satisfied  that  the  human
    rights position would have substantially changed between 2011 and  2017
    when this appeal was reheard. Taking the earlier findings as a starting
    point  for  human  rights  purposes  amounted  to  an  error  in   law.
    Additionally, the Judge should have considered the position of the  two
    eldest children as they were the appellant's dependants.  They  clearly
    came within paragraph 276ADE(iv) HC 395 and in such circumstances  that
    consideration  should  have  been  addressed  before  any   article   8
    consideration. There was merit therefore in both grounds of appeal.

 9. The representatives agreed that this decision could be  remade  in  the
    Upper Tribunal and I was informed  by  the  appellant's  representative
    that the eldest two children, in particular, were taking  various  GCSE
    examinations and had established a  considerable  private  life.  Their
    primary carer remained their mother.

10. The starting point of any reconsideration is whether the appellant  can
    establish that the Immigration Rules were met. The  appellant  had  two
    children who were aged three and four  when  they  entered  the  United
    Kingdom with her. They had been here ever since  and  had  spent  their
    formative part  of  their  lives  in  this  country  attending  school,
    establishing themselves within the community and learning the language.



11. There was evidence contained within the papers that  they  were  taking
    exams and both were intent on taking  A-levels.  There  was  a  younger
    sibling who was born on December 13, 2010 who was a Pakistani national.
    The weight to be attached  to  that  child  is  less  than  the  weight
    attached to the older two  children  who  effectively  have  lived  the
    majority of their lives in this country and who were born in America.

12. Paragraph 276ADE HC 395 had  to  be  considered  in  this  appeal.  The
    starting point in any human rights appeal is  whether  the  Immigration
    Rules were met. Both children came within paragraph 276ADE(iv)  HC  395
    as they had lived here  for  more  than  seven  years.  The  issue  was
    therefore whether it would be reasonable to expect them  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.

13. The respondent's own policy from February 2018 places  an  emphasis  on
    whether a child would have to leave the United Kingdom in the event  of
    a refusal decision. These children were dependants of the appellant and
    it therefore follows that if she had to leave the United  Kingdom  they
    would have to follow with her. The children would be unable  to  remain
    if their primary carer would have to leave.

14. Taking into account all the background and the time these two children,
    in particular, had been in the  United  Kingdom  I  am  satisfied  that
    requiring them to leave the United Kingdom would be unreasonable.

15. Whilst the appellant herself would not have succeeded  under  paragraph
    276 ADE HC 395 I am satisfied that her  two  dependent  children  would
    have succeeded and it therefore follows that it would  be  unreasonable
    to require the appellant to leave the United Kingdom.

16. Having established that the Immigration Rules would had been met so far
    as the children were concerned it follows the appellant  also  succeeds
    as she is their primary carer.

17. On the basis the Immigration Rules  were  met  the  appellant  succeeds
    under article 8 ECHR as the public interest does  not  require  removal
    where a person meets the Immigration Rules.

18. For the record, Mr McVeety did not disagree with this approach in light
    of the evidence presented in this case to the Tribunal.

    DECISION

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

20. I have set aside the original decision only insofar as  the  article  8
    ECHR decision is concerned. In  all  other  respects  the  decision  is
    upheld.

21. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal under article 8 ECHR.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I make no fee award  as  the  appeal  has  been  allowed  following  further
evidence been submitted after the initial refusal decision.
