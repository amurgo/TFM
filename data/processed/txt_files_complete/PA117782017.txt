Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss Mensah, Counsel, instructed by AJO Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I extend the anonymity order under Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and direct that unless and until a Tribunal
    or court directs otherwise, the  appellant  is  granted  anonymity.  No
    report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly  identify  her
    or any member of  her  family.  This  direction  applies  both  to  the
    appellant and to the respondent. Failure to comply with this  direction
    could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. The appellant is an Afghan national who had entered the United  Kingdom
    illegally on June 30, 2014 after a journey that had lasted 2 ï¿½  months.
    His original claim for asylum had been refused  by  the  respondent  on
    February 26, 2015 and following an appeal hearing on September 10, 2015
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ransley dismissed his appeal. She made
    a number of findings including:

      a) She accepted that the appellant's answer in his screening interview
         had been wrongly interpreted and the correct answer  was  that  the
         Taliban had killed his uncle not his father.

      b) The appellant was unable to give a satisfactory  explanation  about
         his father's role within the army despite talking to him  about  it
         over a three/four-year period.

      c) The appellant gave inconsistent evidence  about  his  uncle  having
         been killed by the Taliban.  In  his  first  witness  statement  he
         stated that he had learnt  of  his  uncle's  death  from  villagers
         whereas in his substantive interview he claimed that he  discovered
         his uncle's death when the Taliban came to his home. In his  second
         witness statement he reaffirmed that he learnt his uncle  had  been
         killed by villagers. The Judge concluded  that  if  she  had  heard
         about his uncle's killing in this way he would have said as much in
         his interview. This was a material inconsistency.

      d) The Judge did not find it credible the appellant would have  waited
         for three warnings from the Taliban before leaving the country.

      e) He gave an inconsistent history of when he left Afghanistan. During
         his age assessment interview, the appellant claimed  he  left  five
         days after his paternal  uncle  had  been  killed  whereas  in  his
         witness statement he claimed it was 5/6 months after  his  paternal
         uncle's killing.

      f) The Judge was not prepared to attach weight to his foster  parent's
         evidence that they thought he had been consistent.

      g) It lacked credibility that if his family had paid a substantial sum
         to traffickers to bring him to the United Kingdom that  his  family
         would not have provided him with contact details to let  them  know
         he had arrived safely in the United Kingdom.

      h) The respondent had not been in a position to trace the  appellant's
         family because the appellant claimed he  did  not  know  where  his
         family lived.

 3. In refusing the appellant's current application the  respondent  relied
    on  these  findings  although  accepted  the  appellant   had   adduced
    sufficient evidence to justify a new claim.

 4. His appeal came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Holt  on
    December 13, 2017 and in a decision promulgated on January 17, 2018 she
    dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  on  protection  and  human  rights
    grounds.

 5. The appellant lodged an application for permission to appeal on January
    31, 2018 and Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Landes granted permission
    to appeal on February 22. The Judge's comments  about  the  appellant's
    demeanour was not a finding as such but it is arguable the Judge should
    have considered the evidence of the appellant's  former  foster  carers
    when considering his behaviour and presentation. It was  arguable  that
    the Judge should have put any concerns about Mr J's role to the witness
    and her approach to the Red Cross letter was possibly coloured  by  the
    fact she believed the appellant had kept vital evidence  from  his  own
    representative.

    SUBMISSIONS

 6. Miss Mensah relied on the grounds of appeal that had  been  drafted  by
    former counsel and submitted that  the  Judge  had  erred  (a)  in  her
    assessment of the appellant's demeanour, (b) her approach  to  the  new
    evidence from the Red Cross and the witness Mr J,  (c)  by  failing  to
    attach weight to the expert report of Dr  Fateh  and  (d)  the  Judge's
    approach to the appellant's screening interview in which  she  appeared
    to depart from what had been previously accepted by Judge Ransley.

 7. At the FTT hearing counsel had highlighted the fact that the  appellant
    was a minor and a vulnerable witness and whilst the Judge  acknowledged
    these factors she went on to make personal findings about his demeanour
    which go contrary to the approach recommended in cases such as  KB  and
    AH (credibility-structured approach) Pakistan [2017] UKUT 491 (IAC) and
    MM (DRC, plausibility) DRC [2015] UKIAT 00019. She submitted  that  the
    Judge erred in assessing the  appellant's  demeanour  in  circumstances
    where he was giving evidence for an interpreter.

 8. Miss Mensah argued the Judge had also erred  in  her  approach  to  the
    evidence of Mr J and the letter from the Red Cross about Mr A. Mr J was
    employed by social services and was entrusted to look after minors.  He
    was not appearing as a friend but simply providing information that was
    known to him. Mr J gave clear  evidence  that  he  had  spoken  to  the
    village leader because there was a phone number on Mr A's letter  which
    he had called. The Judge was wrong to make the findings she  did  about
    Mr J. She submitted that his evidence had not been considered  and  the
    Judge's finding  that  Mr  J  had  acted  inappropriately  was  without
    foundation.

 9. The Judge stated that the report of Dr Fateh took the case  no  further
    because his account had been rejected. Miss Mensah submitted  that  the
    report should have been given weight when considering  the  appellant's
    account.

10. Finally, Miss Mensah submitted  that  the  Judge  materially  erred  by
    placing weight on an apparent discrepancy in his screening interview in
    circumstances where the previous Judge  had  accepted  his  version  of
    events.

11. Mr McVeety relied on the Rule 24 response and submitted  there  was  no
    material error in law. He submitted the grounds  of  appeal  failed  to
    recognise that the starting point was the previous  decision  of  Judge
    Ransley which had been upheld by the Upper  Tribunal.  The  Judge  (and
    Upper Tribunal) had rejected his  claim  and  consequently  the  expert
    report took the case no further. The only new evidence that  the  Judge
    had to consider was the letter from the Red Cross and the  evidence  of
    Mr J. He submitted that the appellant claimed he had gone almost  daily
    to the Red Cross and had not been able to  locate  his  family  and  he
    submitted that the Judge was entitled to  be  sceptical  about  Mr  J's
    evidence that he had managed to speak to the village leader and confirm
    the appellant's account. The Judge was entitled to make the finding she
    did about that document and evidence. Weight was a matter for the Judge
    and ultimately in view of the late  disclosure  of  this  document  the
    Judge was entitled to reach the conclusions she did.

12. Turning to the issue of demeanour the  Judge  made  findings  that  the
    appellant did not appear vulnerable or overwhelmed. She did not say the
    appellant was a liar or that his demeanour meant he was untruthful  but
    her observation about the appellant's demeanour was not  a  finding  as
    such. He  submitted  that  this,  contrary  to  the  strong  submission
    advanced, did not amount to an error in law.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

13. This was the appellant's second appeal against a decision to refuse him
    protection. His first appeal had been heard by Judge Ransley and I have
    already set out in paragraph 2 above her core findings.

14.  Following   the   decision   in   Devaseelan   (Second   Appeals-ECHR-
    Extraterritorial Effect) Sri Lanka [2002]  UKIAT  007092  the  Tribunal
    provided guidance on how  second  appeals  should  be  approached.  The
    Tribunal stated:

      a) The first Adjudicator's determination should always be the starting-
         point. It is the authoritative assessment of the Appellant's status
         at the time it was made. In principle issues such  as  whether  the
         Appellant was properly represented, or whether  he  gave  evidence,
         are irrelevant to this.


      b) Facts happening since the  first  Adjudicator's  determination  can
         always be taken into account by the second  Adjudicator.  If  those
         facts lead the second Adjudicator to the conclusion  that,  at  the
         date of his determination and  on  the  material  before  him,  the
         appellant makes his case, so be it. The previous decision,  on  the
         material before the first Adjudicator and  at  that  date,  is  not
         inconsistent.



      c) Facts happening before the first  Adjudicator's  determination  but
         having no relevance to the issues before him can  always  be  taken
         into account by the second Adjudicator. The first Adjudicator  will
         not have been concerned with such facts, and his  determination  is
         not an assessment of them.

15. The appellant unsuccessfully appealed Judge Ransley's decision and  his
    appeal rights were deemed exhausted on November 12, 2015.

16. The respondent was satisfied there was new evidence to consider  as  he
    was given a further  right  of  appeal.  The  appellant  had  submitted
    additional evidence in connection with his mental health, the Red Cross
    and his article 8 claim.

17. The appellant adduced further news reports to support  his  claim  that
    Afghanistan was too dangerous for him. I note  such  evidence  did  not
    form part of Miss Mensah's submission to me although she  did  rely  on
    the expert report of Dr Fatah dated November 21,  2017.  This  document
    was not considered by the respondent as it post-dated the date  of  his
    application and whilst Judge Holt did consider the report she concluded
    that as he was not at risk the report took his case no further.

18. Miss Mensah argued that the failure to  consider  this  report  was  an
    error in law but I disagree with this  submission.  This  was  not  the
    appellant's first appeal on  protection  grounds.  It  was  his  second
    appeal and following the decision  in  Devaseelan  the  Judge  was  not
    required to revisit issues that had already been dealt with unless  the
    new evidence altered the previous evidence.

19. The fact Judge  Ransley  had  made  a  number  of  adverse  credibility
    findings  against  him  meant  Dr  Fatah's  report  added  nothing   to
    appellant's claim. The report was prepared on the  basis  of  what  the
    appellant had told him but Judge Ransley's findings meant Judge  Holt's
    approach to the report cannot be faulted.

20. Miss Mensah also submitted the Judge  had  erred  in  her  approach  to
    whether the appellant's father or uncle had been killed by the Taliban.
    Whilst I accept the Judge was wrong to refer in  paragraph  16  of  her
    decision to the inconsistency between  the  appellant's  screening  and
    asylum interview the Judge made it clear later in paragraph 16 that she
    only revisited this issue because the appellant  mentioned  it  in  his
    December 2017 statement. She did  not  however  go  behind  what  Judge
    Ransley had stated so there is no error in law of this issue.

21. Before Judge Holt the appellant relied on the evidence of Mr K and Mr S
    and the letter from the Red Cross.  The  remaining  grounds  of  appeal
    centred on the Judge's approach to this evidence  and  the  appellant's
    demeanour at the hearing.

22. Miss Mensah submitted that the Judge had erred in her approach  to  the
    appellant's demeanour.

23. In MM the Tribunal set out the approach  to  be  taken  in  respect  of
    credibility, plausibility  and  oral  testimony  and  made  clear  that
    relying  on  demeanour  to  decide  the  issues  of   credibility   and
    plausibility amounted to an error in law.

24. Ms Mensah submitted that the Judge had erred in law  by  commenting  at
    paragraph 17 that the appellant was a  "confident,  very  self-assured,
    polite and mature individual, irrespective of the vagueness when he was
    talking about the key issues in his case."

25. In KB & AH the Tribunal made clear that when  assessing  credibility  a
    structured approach should be undertaken and regard should  be  had  to
    the respondent's own Asylum Policy Instruction,  Assessing  credibility
    and refugee status Version 3.0, 6 January 2015. The Tribunal noted that
    where an account was internally consistent  and  then  consistent  with
    objective material then these are positive factors  to  be  taken  into
    account when considering credibility.

26. However, when considering the core of the appellant's  claim  I  remind
    myself that his claim had already been rejected by the Tribunal because
    the Judge found  that  his  account  contained  a  number  of  internal
    inconsistencies.

27. Having read paragraph 17 I am satisfied  she  did  not  rely  on  these
    comments when assessing the appellant's credibility. Her comments  were
    based not only on how the appellant was before her but  also  based  on
    the  reference/statement  provided  by  Mr  W.  In  other  words,   her
    assessment mirrored what she perceived to be the views of  someone  who
    knew him much better than she did. This was not a case where the  Judge
    looked at the appellant, listened  to  him  give  evidence  through  an
    interpreter and then made the observations she did.  This  was  a  case
    where someone who  knew  the  appellant  much  better  than  the  Judge
    provided a statement about the appellant and Judge Holt attached weight
    to that statement and ultimately came to the same  conclusion.  In  any
    event the issue of whether he was at risk had already been addressed at
    the previous hearing and formed no part of that decision  making.  Miss
    Mensah's submission that the Judge  wrongly  approached  the  issue  of
    demeanour does not amount to an error in law.

28. Miss Mensah has submitted that the Judge erred in her approach  to  the
    evidence provided by  Mr  J  and  Mr  S.  This  then  impacted  on  her
    assessment of the Red Cross letter. The Judge set out the  evidence  of
    Mr S and Mr J in paragraphs 18 and 19 respectively.

29. The Judge considered Mr S's statement dated December 13, 2017  (day  of
    hearing). The Judge noted that  the  witness  was  an  interpreter  who
    assisted Sefton Social  Services  and  regularly  interpreted  for  the
    appellant when dealing with social services and at school. He described
    the appellant as being confident and going from "strength to strength".
    The Judge concluded Mr S was more of a character  reference  and  added
    nothing to the appellant's appeal. I see nothing wrong with the Judge's
    conclusion.

30. The Judge then considered Mr J's evidence and she stated  at  an  early
    stage her concerns about his evidence. Miss Mensah submitted  that  the
    witness was called as he had dealings with two Afghan  minors  and  had
    valuable evidence to give about his contact with a  village  leader  in
    Afghanistan. Mr McVeety submitted the Judge was tasked with considering
    the evidence  and  making  findings.  The  Judge  was  entitled  to  be
    sceptical about Mr J's evidence in light of the fact the appellant  had
    regularly visited/contacted the Red Cross and had been unable  to  find
    out anything about his family.

31. Mr J gave oral evidence and adopted a  letter  he  had  provided  dated
    December 4, 2017. He referred to a Red Cross letter that had been  only
    produced on the day of hearing. This letter related to  another  Afghan
    and provided contact details for a Mr G who was a  village  leader  who
    also, coincidentally, knew the appellant and Mr J.

32. Having listened to the appellant's evidence about  the  Red  Cross  the
    Judge rejected Mr J's evidence. Paragraph 22 of her decision is central
    as she explained that she did not find it credible that Mr J  was  able
    to speak to the village leader  but  the  Red  Cross,  with  all  their
    resources  and  the  same  information,  were  unable  to  confirm  the
    information. There was no evidence before Judge Holt that the Red Cross
    had been contacted or had failed  in  their  attempts  to  contact  the
    village leader. The Judge therefore rejected the evidence of Mr  J  and
    gave detailed reasons for her findings.

33. This was not a case where the Judge had  not  considered  the  evidence
    from Mr J but it was more a case that the Judge rejected  the  evidence
    and gave reasons for her conclusions. These findings were clearly  open
    to her and her findings were well reasoned.

34. I therefore conclude there was no error in law.

    DECISION

35. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.  I uphold the decision.
