For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In a decision sent on 7 September 2017 Judge  Griffith  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (FtT) dismissed the appeal for want  of  jurisdiction  by
    reference  to  the  reported  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal,  Sala
    (Extended family members - right of appeal) [2016] UKUT.  At  the  time
    the grounds were drafted Sala was awaiting  hearing  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal.  Since then, of course, the Court of  Appeal  has  handed  down
    judgment in Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 overturning Sala.

2.   Both parties are  in  agreement  with  me  that  the  result  of  these
    developments should be that the case is remitted to the FtT for  it  to
    make a substantive decision  in  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal of a residence card dated 9 June 2016.

3.   The  FtT  Judge's  decision  cannot  stand  in  the  light  of  binding
    authority concluding that extended family members do have  a  right  of
    appeal.  Accordingly I set aside that decision for  material  error  of
    law.

4.   The case is remitted to the FtT to be heard afresh on  the  basis  that
    it does have jurisdiction.


No anonymity direction is made.



Signed:                                 Date: 28 January 2018
