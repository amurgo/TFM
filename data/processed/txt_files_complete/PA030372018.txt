     DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. The appellant,  a  citizen  of  Nigeria,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT") against a decision dated 19  December  2018,  being  a
    decision to refuse a protection and human rights claim in  the  context
    of a decision to make a deportation order pursuant to section 32(5)  of
    the UK Borders Act 2007. Within the decision the respondent also issued
    a certificate under section 72  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002. The FtT dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 2. At the hearing before me on 11 December 2019 it was agreed between  the
    parties that the FtT erred in law  for  the  reasons  advanced  in  the
    grounds of appeal upon which permission to appeal was granted.

 3. It was further agreed between the parties that the errors  of  law  are
    such as to require the decision of the FtT to be set aside and for  the
    appeal to be remitted to the FtT for a hearing de novo.

 4. In the circumstances, I set aside the decision of the FtT for error  of
    law and remit the appeal to the FtT for  a  hearing  de  novo,  on  all
    grounds, before a judge other than  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lucas,
    with no findings of fact preserved.

 5. In remitting the appeal I have had  regard  to  paragraph  7.2  of  the
    Practice Statement of the Senior President of Tribunals.

 6. Pursuant to rule 40(3)(a) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the  decision
    being made with the consent of the parties.
