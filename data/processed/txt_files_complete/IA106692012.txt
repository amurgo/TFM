Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Niyi Aborisade of OA Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Allan of the Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a Nigerian citizen, born on  15th  January  1960,  who
    came to this country on a visitor's visa  in  September  2005  and  has
    since overstayed.  In November 2011 he applied for a residence card  as
    the family member of a Dutch national, Carmen Canto Pimentel,  whom  he
    said he had married by  proxy  in  Nigeria  on  13th  July  2011.   The
    application was refused on 26th April  2012,  on  the  basis  that  the
    evidence provided did not prove Ms Pimentel to be a 'qualified  person'
    in terms of reg. 6 of the EEA Regulations 2006, while the  validity  of
    the Nigerian certificate adduced as proof  of  the  marriage  was  also
    queried.

2.   Notice of appeal was received by the First-tier  Tribunal  on  4th  May
    2012,  the  grounds  of  appeal  being  that  the   Nigerian   marriage
    certificate was indeed a genuine document and that the appellant's wife
    was indeed exercising 'Treaty rights'.  The decision was also  said  to
    constitute an unlawful interference with the Article 8 right to private
    and family life.  It was indicated on the notice of appeal that an oral
    hearing was requested, but the administrative staff wrote back  to  say
    that the appeal form had not been accompanied by a fee,  and  that  the
    requisite fee for an oral hearing was �140.  Mr Igbede  responded  that
    he had never requested an oral hearing and that he wanted his appeal to
    be determined 'on the papers', for which he attached the  fee  of  �80.
    OA Solicitors were now instructed, and they confirmed that  the  appeal
    should be determined on the papers.

3.   When the papers were  put  before  Judge  Nicholls  on  4th  September,
    however, he directed that the case be adjourned for  an  oral  hearing,
    and this was duly listed for 28th September 2012.  This appears to have
    been done without asking Mr Igbede whether he wanted  an  oral  hearing
    and whether he was willing to pay the extra fee.  The extra fee was not
    in fact paid, and the appeal went ahead with a Yoruba interpreter being
    booked for Mr Igbede and a Spanish interpreter for his wife, who  hails
    originally from the  Dominican  Republic.   It  would  seem  that  this
    arrangement was not contrary to the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Immigration
    and Asylum Chamber) Fees Order 2011, which at Article  5(4)  stipulates
    that where, having paid the �80 fee for  a  paper  determination,  "the
    appellant withdraws  their  consent  to  the  appeal  being  determined
    without a  hearing",  the  balance  of  �60  "becomes  payable  on  the
    withdrawal of that consent."  In this instance, however, it was  not  a
    matter of the appellant withdrawing his consent.   Rather,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal decided of its own motion to list the appeal for an  oral
    hearing.

4.   Mr Igbede and Ms Pimentel both gave evidence at the hearing,  it  being
    confirmed that a customary wedding ceremony had taken  place  in  their
    absence and that it had  been  registered  the  following  day  at  the
    customary court by the appellant's  brother.   The  Presenting  Officer
    could adduce no evidence that the  marriage  certificate  was  a  false
    document, and Judge Nicholls was satisfied  on  the  evidence  that  Ms
    Pimentel was a worker for the purposes of regulation 6.  But the  issue
    was now raised whether the marriage attested by the  certificate  could
    be recognised under English law.  The judge acknowledged that it  might
    be valid in the local area where it had been registered, but he was not
    satisfied that it was valid according to the laws of the Nigerian state
    itself.  He therefore concluded that the appellant was not entitled  to
    a residence card as the family member  of  an  EEA  national.   In  the
    alternative, it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the decision
    to refuse a  residence  card  breached  the  appellant's  rights  under
    Article 8, but that argument was rejected  by  Judge  Nicholls  because
    there had been no decision to remove the appellant.

5.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was now sought on the  basis
    that the First-tier judge had misunderstood the position  of  customary
    marriages within the federal law of Nigeria.  It was also asserted that
    the judge had ignored Article 3.2(b) of the Citizens  Directive,  which
    enjoins the Member States to facilitate the entry and residence of  the
    partner with whom a Union citizen  has  a  durable  relationship,  duly
    attested.  This ground was not included in the notice of appeal to  the
    First-tier Tribunal, nor was it raised  at  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Nicholls.  Nor was  it  mentioned  by  Judge  Chohan  when  he  granted
    permission to appeal.  His grant was confined to the issue  of  whether
    proxy marriages are valid in Nigeria, on which issue it was  said  that
    "cogent evidence" would be needed that such marriages are recognised.

6.   On 16th January 2013 the appeal came before Upper Tribunal Judge  McKee
    and  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Grimes,  when  the  appellant  was
    represented by Mr Aborisade and the respondent by Mr  Deller.   It  was
    decided  that  the  case  would  be  suitable  for  listing  before   a
    Presidential or Vice-Presidential panel, as  it  was  one  of  a  large
    number of similar cases which had come before the First-tier  Tribunal,
    where Nigerian men with irregular immigration status  had  applied  for
    residence cards on the basis of marriage to nationals of Member  States
    by proxy in Nigeria.  It was clearly desirable that guidance  be  given
    on whether such marriages could confer rights under European law.   The
    case was accordingly adjourned without a decision being made on whether
    there had been an error of law at first instance, and in due course  it
    was listed before a Vice-Presidential panel of the Upper Tribunal.

7.   For the hearing, OA Solicitors provided an Appellant's Bundle in  which
    was reproduced an Affidavit sworn on 14th July 2011 by the  appellant's
    brother, who declares himself head of the  Igbede  family  and  deposes
    that a customary marriage took place by  proxy  the  previous  day,  at
    which the bride was represented by a Mr Morina Sabina (no  relation  of
    hers), and a dowry of a  goat  and  500  Naira  was  collected  by  the
    representative.  Also reproduced was a certificate issued on 14th  July
    2011 by the Registrar of the Customary Court Central Registry  at  Mapo
    Hill, Ibadan, expressing satisfaction  that  the  traditional  marriage
    conducted the previous day between Mr Igbede and Ms Pimentel "conformed
    with the native law and  custom  of  the  land."   The  basis  for  the
    Registrar's satisfaction was an oral motion moved on 14th July 2011  by
    Mr Igbede's brother at the customary court, supported by the  Affidavit
    already mentioned.

8.   The rest of the Appellant's Bundle consists largely of  Nigerian  cases
    concerning customary marriage, but none concern  proxy  marriage  where
    one of the parties is not Nigerian and is not represented by  a  member
    of her family.  There is also an "Expert Opinion" by one Prince  Lateef
    O. Fagbemi, a Senior  Advocate  of  Nigeria  practising  from  Temitope
    Chambers in Abuja.  Emphasizing the continuing importance of  customary
    law in a wide range of matters, he lists the "essential ingredients" of
    a customary marriage, as settled by a long time  of  decisions  by  the
    superior courts of Nigeria, as follows :
         (i)   capacity of either party to marry;
         (ii)  consent of the parties and of their parents;
         (iii) payment of dowry by the intending husband to the  parents  of
    the bride; and
         (iv) a ceremony of marriage according to the custom of the people,
         and handing over of the woman to the man's family,  except  in  the
         case of marriage by proxy.

9.   Regarding marriage by proxy, Mr Fagbemi  explains  that  customary  law
    allows this, provided the  parents  of  both  parties  consent  to  the
    marriage and that they or their  representatives  are  present  at  the
    wedding ceremony, so that the dowry can be handed over to  the  bride's
    parents and the bride (if she is present, but not her husband)  can  be
    handed over to the groom's parents.

10.  At the hearing, we raised the question whether the law of  the  country
    of Ms Pimentel's nationality (the Netherlands, not  Spain,  her  mother
    tongue having given this mistaken impression) or of  her  domicile,  if
    that  is  different,  permits  entry  into  a  potentially   polygamous
    marriage, such as a Nigerian customary  marriage.   Since  the  Private
    International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 this has not been
    a problem for people domiciled in England and Wales,  so  Mr  Aborisade
    sought to argue that Ms Pimentel has acquired a domicile of  choice  in
    this country.  He founded on one  sentence  in  Ms  Pimentel's  witness
    statement : "Our marriage is based on mutual love and we intend to live
    permanently together in the UK."  That is very far from dislodging  the
    presumption that Ms Pimentel has retained her domicile of  origin,  and
    we have no evidence before us concerning the law of that domicile.

11.  In any event, two of the "essential ingredients" of a  valid  customary
    marriage, identified in the Expert Report provided to us,  are  clearly
    missing in the present case.  The Affidavit sworn  by  the  appellant's
    brother, Paul Lawal,  includes  an  assertion  that  the  marriage  was
    conducted with the consent of the bride's  parents,  but  there  is  no
    confirmation from them that their consent had  been  obtained.   It  is
    also asserted that the bride was represented by a Mr Morina Sabina, but
    there  is  no  confirmation  from  the  bride's  parents  that  he  was
    authorised to represent them.  In short, there is no reliable  evidence
    that the consent of Ms Pimentel's parents was  obtained  or  that  they
    were represented at the wedding by someone whom they had appointed.  On
    the basis of the expert evidence provided by Mr Fagbemi, we  cannot  be
    satisfied that the requirements of a valid customary marriage were  met
    in this instance.

12.  It follows that Judge Nicholls did not err at first  instance  when  he
    concluded that "the Appellant has not demonstrated that his marriage to
    his wife is a valid marriage in accordance with the laws of the Federal
    State of Nigeria."   Insofar  as  customary  marriages  are  lawful  in
    Nigeria, there was not been a valid customary marriage in  the  present
    case, for want of essential ingredients of such a  marriage.   Nor  did
    Judge Nicholls make an error of law when he found that  Article  8  was
    not engaged in the present appeal, because the refusal of  a  residence
    card did not prevent the appellant and Ms Pimentel from  continuing  to
    live together.  Mr Aborisade contended that no consideration was  given
    to whether the appellant was in a "durable relationship"  with  an  EEA
    national, such as to make him  an  "extended  family  member"  for  the
    purposes of reg. 8 of the EEA Regulations 2006.  But  this  was  not  a
    contention which was raised in the notice of appeal to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or at the hearing before Judge Nicholls.  So he cannot be said
    to have made an error of law by not considering it.

     DECISION

     The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld, and the  appeal
    is dismissed.
