For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  1.  This  has  been  a  remote  hearing  to  which  both   parties   have
     consented. The form of remote hearing was video by  Microsoft  Teams
     (V). A face  to  face  hearing  was  not  held  because  it  was  not
     practicable and all issues could be determined in a remote hearing.  I
     did not experience any difficulties, and neither party  expressed  any
     concern, with the process.

  2. The appellant is a citizen of India born on  6  August  1982  who  has
     lived in the UK since 2008. He is appealing against  the  decision  of
     Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cartin ("the judge") promulgated on 6
     May 2020 dismissing his human rights appeal.

Background and the decision of the respondent  dated  8  August  2017  ("the
refusal decision")

  3. On 24 March 2016 the appellant applied for indefinite leave to  remain
     (ILR) as a Tier 1 (General) migrant. On 8 August 2017 the  application
     was refused. Four reasons were given by the  respondent  for  refusing
     the application:

        a. First, there was a discrepancy between the  income  declared  by
           the applicant to the respondent in an application for leave made
           in 2011 and the income he declared to HMRC in the  corresponding
           tax years. I will refer to this as "the 2011 discrepancy";

        b. Second, there was a discrepancy between the income  declared  by
           the applicant to the respondent in an application for leave made
           in 2013 and the income he declared to HMRC in the  corresponding
           tax years. I will refer to this as "the 2013 discrepancy";

        c. Third, the applicant failed to declare a police caution; and

        d. Fourth, the applicant had been absent from the  UK  for  lengthy
           periods  which  were  inconsistent  with  the  requirements   of
           paragraph 245AAA(c) of the Immigration Rules.

  4. The judge accepted the appellant's explanation for the first and third
     reason identified in paragraph 3 above. As there  is  no  cross-appeal
     from the respondent on  these  issues  they  will  not  be  considered
     further.

  5. The decision of the respondent in respect of the  second  reason  (the
     2013 discrepancy) and the fourth reason (absence  from  the  UK)  will
     need to be considered further.

The 2013 discrepancy

  6. In a Tier 1 application made on 17 May 2013, the appellant claimed  to
     have self-employment net profit of �20,331 for the period 1  May  2012
     to 30 April 2013. This corresponds to  the  2012/13  and  2013/14  tax
     years. However in  his  2012/13  tax  return  the  appellant  declared
     �10,972 self-employment income  and  he  did  not  declare  any  self-
     employed net income for 2013/14. He subsequently, in 2016, amended the
     2012/13 tax declaration to  show  self-employment  income  of  �20,331
     (i.e. a figure which matches that which he provided in respect of  the
     Tier 1 application).

  7. In the refusal  decision,  the  respondent  noted  that  there  was  a
     difference  of  �9,359  between  the  declarations  to  HMRC  and  the
     respondent. The respondent observed that the appellant had stated,  in
     a completed questionnaire submitted on 30 March 2017, that he had made
     a mistake and "misinterpreted the details"  of  the  tax  return.  The
     respondent stated that the onus was on the appellant to submit correct
     figures and she was not satisfied he had given a credible account  for
     the "clear discrepancy".  The  respondent  also  stated  that  if  the
     earnings declared to the respondent had  been  consistent  with  those
     declared to HMRC he would not have been granted leave to remain.

Absences from the UK

  8. Paragraph 245AAA(c) of  the  Immigration  Rules  stipulates  that  any
     absence from the UK must have been for a purpose  that  is  consistent
     with the appellant's basis to stay in the UK,  including  paid  annual
     leave or for serious or compelling reasons. In the  refusal  decision,
     the respondent stated that paragraph 245AAA(c) was contravened because
     the appellant was outside of the UK for two substantial  periods:  one
     of 46 days  excluding  weekends  and  another  of  42  days  excluding
     weekends. The respondent observed  in  the  refusal  letter  that  the
     appellant's absences were not verified by an employer as being part of
     his annual leave.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

  9. A representative for the respondent did not attend  the  hearing.  The
     judge directed himself to the Surendran Guidelines, which are appended
     to the decision in MNM (Surendran guidelines for Adjudicators) Kenya *
     [2000] UKIAT 00005. As observed by the judge in paragraph  27  of  the
     decision, the Surendran Guidelines provide guidance to judges  on  how
     to proceed when the respondent is not represented.

 10. As noted above, the  judge  rejected  two  of  the  respondent's  four
     contentions in the refusal decision:  (i)  that  the  appellant  acted
     dishonestly in respect of the 2011  discrepancy;  and  (ii)  that  the
     appellant failed to disclose a  police  caution.  However,  the  judge
     agreed with  the  respondent  in  respect  of  two  others:  that  the
     appellant (i) had been dishonest in respect of the  2013  discrepancy;
     and that (ii) he had failed to adequately explain  his  absences  from
     the UK for the purposes of paragraph 245AAA(c).

The 2013 discrepancy

 11. The appellant's explanation for the 2013 discrepancy before the First-
     tier Tribunal was entirely different to that  which  he  gave  to  the
     respondent in  the  30  March  2017  questionnaire  response.  In  the
     questionnaire response, he claimed that the discrepancy was due  to  a
     mistake he had made. In contrast, before the  First-tier  Tribunal  he
     argued that there had not in fact been  a  mistake  and  the  apparent
     discrepancy was explained by (i) a refund to a customer made after the
     2013 application was made; and (ii) income received  between  6  April
     2013 and 30 April 2013, which was subsequently,  in  the  2013/14  tax
     return, offset by a loss arising because of  expenses  incurred  after
     the application. The appellant claimed that  he  was  mistaken  (as  a
     result of poor advice) when he made the "corrections" to  his  2012/13
     tax return, as there was in fact nothing wrong with the return.

 12.  The  judge  rejected  the  appellant's  new   explanation   for   the
     discrepancy. The judge  found  there  to  be  multiple  flaws  in  the
     appellant's explanation. These include that:

        a. It was unlikely that  the  appellant  would  have  made  such  a
           substantial refund (paragraph 53);

        b. There was contradictory information about when the payment,  for
           which  the  refund  was  said  to  have  been  given,  was  made
           (paragraph 54).

        c. The document relied on by the appellant to show that he  paid  a
           refund could easily have been forged and he had not submitted  a
           complete set of bank statements which would more authoritatively
           show that the refund had been  paid.  The  judge  described  the
           absence of complete bank statements as "telling" (paragraph 55).

        d. As complete bank statements were not provided, the full  picture
           of the appellant's activity could not be seen  and  it  appeared
           that the appellant may have engaged in "recycling  of  the  same
           money to give the appearance of money received"  (paragraphs  58
           and 64).

        e. Several payments into the appellant's account  showed  the  same
           reference number, and did not appear to come from bank  accounts
           bearing the names of customers (paragraph 59).

        f. The appellant appeared to  have  "counted  twice"  some  of  the
           claimed income (paragraph 60).

        g. It is "surprising" that the appellant's income  in  2013/14  tax
           year was all in the first month of the tax year and it "begs the
           question" as to why his expenses were so high for the  remainder
           of the tax year (paragraph 61-63).

Absences from the UK

 13. In respect of the appellant's absences from the UK,  the  judge  found
     that a letter produced by  the  appellant,  dated  24  December  2012,
     purporting to be from his employer, had not been  submitted  with  the
     appellant's application and was  not  authentic.  The  primary  reason
     given by the judge for finding that it was not authentic was that  the
     date of the letter (24 December 2012) was "remarkably  strange"  given
     that the appellant would not have  needed  such  a  letter  until  his
     application in May 2013.



Grounds of Appeal

 14. Multiple grounds were initially advanced.  Permission  to  appeal  was
     refused by both the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal.  Following
     a judicial review  application  to  the  High  Court,  permission  was
     granted on a single ground, which is  that  the  judge  erred  by  not
     "putting to" the appellant his concerns and  therefore  the  appellant
     was deprived of the opportunity to respond to  those  concerns  before
     adverse findings were made.

 15. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Gajjar and Mr  Whitwell  agreed  that
     the scope of the appeal before  me  was  limited  to  this  procedural
     fairness issue.

Analysis

 16. There is a tension between, on the one hand,  a  judge  not  appearing
     biased by "entering the arena" and putting points to a party; and,  on
     the other, the need for a party to know the case against  him  when  a
     judge is minded to make findings adverse to him which  have  not  been
     squarely put to him.  This  tension  is  particularly  acute  in  this
     jurisdiction in cases where the  respondent  is  not  represented  and
     therefore there has been no cross examination of the appellant.

 17. This issue was addressed almost two  decades  ago  in  WN  (Surendran;
     credibility; new evidence) Democratic Republic of Congo  [2004]  UKIAT
     00213. In paragraphs 39 - 40 of WN Mr Justice Ouseley stated:

        "39. There is a tension, reflected in the  [Surendran]  guidelines,
        between fairness in enabling a party to know the points on which an
        Adjudicator may be minded to reach conclusions adverse to him where
        they have not directly otherwise been raised, and fairness  in  the
        Adjudicator not appearing to be partisan, asking questions that no-
        one  else  has  thought  it  necessary  to  ask.  This  has  proved
        troublesome on a number of occasions.

        40. The tension should be  resolved,  so  far  as  practicable,  by
        recognising the following:

           1) It is not necessary for obvious points on credibility  to  be
              put, where credibility is generally at issue in the light  of
              the refusal letter or obviously at issue as a result of later
              evidence.

           2) Where the point is important to the decision but not  obvious
              or where the issue of credibility has not been raised or does
              not obviously arise on new material, or where an Appellant is
              unrepresented, it is generally better for the Adjudicator  to
              raise the point if it is not otherwise raised. He can  do  so
              by direct questioning of a witness in an appropriate manner.

           3) We have set out the way in which  such  questions  should  be
              asked.

           (4) There is no hard and fast rule embodied in (1) and  (2).  It
              is a question in each case for a judgment as to what is  fair
              and properly perceived as fair.

        The Surendran guidelines and MNM should be read with what  we  have
        set out above."

 18. Mr Gajjar  submitted  that  the  guidance  enunciated  in  WN  is  not
     applicable in this case. He gave three reasons: first, he argued that,
     in contrast to WN, which was an asylum appeal, in this case the burden
     of proof was on the respondent; second, he argued that the  allegation
     of dishonesty was more serious in this case; and third, he argued that
     there have been advances in the law. He  relied,  in  respect  of  the
     latter argument, on Balajigari and others v SSHD [2019] EWCA  Civ  673
     and Ashfaq (Balajigari: appeals) [2020] UKUT 00226 (IAC), as  well  as
     AM (fair hearing) Sudan [2015] UKUT 00656 (IAC).

 19. I disagree with Mr Gajjar  on  this  issue.  Firstly,  Balajigari  and
     Ashfaq concern an entirely different issue (the opportunity to respond
     to an allegation by the respondent)  which  has  nothing  to  do  with
     procedural fairness in a hearing, and AM is also concerned a different
     issue (independent judicial research). Secondly, in WN the honesty  of
     the appellant was also in question.  In  that  case,  the  appellant's
     account was not  believed.  The  significance  of  not  believing  the
     appellant was, if anything, even more significant in WN than  in  this
     case, as a consequence was the refusal of  his  protection  claim  and
     potential removal to a country where,  if  he  had  been  telling  the
     truth, he would face a very serious risk. Thirdly, there is nothing in
     WN to indicate that it is limited to cases in which the burden  is  on
     the appellant and there is no reason in principle why that  should  be
     the case.

 20. In my view, the guidance given by Justice Ouseley in paragraphs  39  -
     40 of WN is authoritative and clear, is applicable to this  case,  and
     is not undermined by subsequent case law. In  this  respect,  I  agree
     entirely with Mr Whitwell,  who  drew  my  attention  to  Muhandiramge
     (section S-LTR.1.7) [2015] UKUT 00675 (IAC), where reliance was placed
     on the same passages in  R  (on  the  application  of  Maheshwaran)  v
     Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] EWCA  Civ  173  that
     were cited in WN, which state:

        "4. Undoubtedly a failure to put to a party to litigation  a  point
        which is decided against him can be  grossly  unfair  and  lead  to
        injustice. He must have a  proper  opportunity  to  deal  with  the
        point. Adjudicators must bear  this  in  mind.  Where  a  point  is
        expressly conceded by one party it will usually be unfair to decide
        the case against the other party on the basis that  the  concession
        was wrongly made, unless the tribunal indicates that it  is  minded
        to take that course. Cases can occur when fairness will require the
        reopening of an appeal because some point of significance - perhaps
        arising out of a post - hearing decision of  the  higher  courts  -
        requires it. However, such cases will be rare.

        5. Where much depends on the credibility of a party and  when  that
        party makes several inconsistent statements which  are  before  the
        decision maker, that party manifestly has a forensic problem.  Some
        will choose to confront the inconsistencies straight  on  and  make
        evidential or forensic submissions on them. Others will  hope  that
        'least  said,  soonest   mended'   and   consider   that   forensic
        concentration on the point will only make matters worse and that it
        would be better to try and switch the tribunal's attention to  some
        other aspect of the case. Undoubtedly it is open  to  the  tribunal
        expressly to put a particular inconsistency to a witness because it
        considers that the witness may not  be  alerted  to  the  point  or
        because  it  fears  that  it  may  have  perceived   something   as
        inconsistent  with  an  earlier  answer  which  in  truth  is   not
        inconsistent. Fairness may in some circumstances require this to be
        done but this will not be the usual  case.  Usually  the  tribunal,
        particularly if the party is represented, will  remain  silent  and
        see how the case unfolds."

 21. In addition to making  submissions  about  where,  in  principle,  the
     balance lies between staying out of the fray and putting points to  an
     appellant in an appeal  where  the  respondent  is  unrepresented,  Mr
     Gajjar and Mr  Whitwell  took  me  through  several  passages  of  the
     decision: with Mr Gajjar arguing that it was evident from  these  that
     the core reasons the judge did not  accept  the  appellant's  innocent
     explanation were not put to the appellant (and it was not possible for
     the appellant to have anticipated that these  points  would  be  taken
     against him); and with Mr Whitwell arguing that it was  (or  ought  to
     have been) sufficiently clear to the appellant what points  he  needed
     to address.

 22. Although I disagree with Mr Gajjar about the applicability  of  WN,  I
     accept his argument that the  decision  is  undermined  by  procedural
     fairness. In this case, the appellant was  not  (and  could  not  have
     been) aware  of  the  judge's  core  reasons  for  not  accepting  his
     explanation for the 2013 discrepancy, as they were not included in the
     respondent's refusal decision and were not put to him either before or
     at the hearing. The judge's reasons for not  believing  the  appellant
     included that he appeared to have been "recycling  money"  to  give  a
     false appearance, counting income twice, and claiming money  was  from
     clients when it was not (as  indicated  by  the  same  bank  reference
     number appearing). These highly significant points were central to the
     reason the appellant was not believed, but the  appellant  would  have
     had no idea, until he read the decision, that these points were  being
     taken against him, and he had  no  opportunity  to  respond  to  them.
     Therefore, this case, in my  view,  is  precisely  the  type  of  case
     envisaged by WN where fairness  would  require  the  appellant  to  be
     notified of the adverse points in order for him to have an opportunity
     to address them.

 23. I reach the same conclusion in respect  of  the  appellant's  absences
     from the UK, as the judge found that the employer's letter adduced  by
     the appellant was not authentic without the appellant being aware that
     the authenticity of the letter was at issue.

 24. For these reasons, I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
     is undermined by procedural unfairness and cannot stand. In the  light
     of the nature of the error of law identified,  it  is  appropriate  in
     this case for the appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  to
     be made afresh by a different judge.



Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

The decision involved the making of a material  error  of  law  and  is  set
