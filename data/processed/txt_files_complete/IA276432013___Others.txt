For the Respondent:    Miss A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

 1. The appellants are citizens of Nepal  born  on  27  February  1975,  12
    November  1982  and  3  July  2010  and  they  appealed   against   the
    respondent's decision to refuse the first appellant's  application  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and the  second  and
    third appellants applications for leave to remain as  the  partner  and
    child of a Tier 1 Migrant.  They also appealed the decision  to  remove
    them from the United  Kingdom  under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration
    Nationality and Asylum Act 2006.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor dismissed the  appeals  and  an
    application for permission to appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was also  refused
    by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kebede  on  29th  April  2014  however   an
    application for judicial review was granted by Mr Justice  McGowan.  On
    10th December 2014  Vice  President  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Ockleton
    granted permission to appeal.  The matter was listed before me  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 3. The Secretary of  State's  refusal  dated  from  20th  June  2013.  The
    appellant's application was dismissed because the appellant  could  not
    fulfil the Rules  in  relation  to  Appendix  A  for  25  points  under
    provision D of Table 4 of Appendix A of the  Immigration  Rules.  Under
    that provision he had supplied sufficient evidence  to  demonstrate  he
    had access to at least  ï¿½50,000  but  it  was  also  a  requirement  to
    demonstrate that he met the following additional criteria:

         "(iv)    are engaged in  business  activity  other  than  the  work
             necessary to administer his business in  an  occupation  which
             appears  on  the  listed  skills  to  national  qualifications
             framework level 4 or above as stated in Codes of Practice  and
             Appendix J and provides the specified evidence in paragraph 41-
             SD."

 4. The advertisement produced by the appellant did not  contain  his  name
    and therefore did not meet the requirements as specified  in  paragraph
    41-SD(C)(iii) of Appendix A.  As a result he had not demonstrated  that
    he had met the requirements of the Rules to be awarded the points under
    provision D of Table 4 of Appendix A.

 5. Application for permission to appeal  was  made  essentially  on  three
    grounds as outlined by Mr Malik.  First, that the  current  version  of
    paragraph 245AA would have assisted the appellant but  the  Immigration
    Rules which were current at the time of the hearing would have applied.
    Mr Malik conceded that the duties in respect of paragraph 245AA were in
    respect of the Secretary of State rather than duties on the  First-tier
    Tribunal and he had to accept that those duties were not  in  existence
    as at the date of decision which was the relevant date.   I  also  find
    that  the  judge  carefully  explored  this  issue  [57  -58]  of   the
    determination and there is no error of law in that respect.

 6. In relation to ground 3, and the lawfulness of the Section 47 decision,
    Mr Malik wished to reserve his position in relation to Castro  (Removal
    of Section 47 as amended) [2014] UKUT 00234 (IAC).  He conceded that he
    was obliged  to  follow  Castro  wished  to  note  that  there  was  an
    application for permission to appeal pending in the higher courts.   As
    present I find I am obliged to follow Castro and I find no error of law
    in this regard either.

 7. The crux of the matter related to ground 2.  It  was  argued  that  the
    failure of the appellant to provide his name in  the  advertisement  as
    required by paragraph 41-SD(C)(iii) of Appendix A  of  the  Immigration
    Rules was de minimis (the law is not concerned with small things).   MD
    (Jamaica) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA  Civ
    213 and Miah v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 261 were cited.

 8. Mr Malik drew my attention to page 14 of the appellant's bundle  before
    the  First-tier  Tribunal.  What  was  missing  in  relation   to   the
    advertisement, was the appellant's name. Mr Malik  submitted  that  the
    name of the business had been  submitted.   This  was  sufficient.  The
    rules should be construed in a sensible way and read as  a  whole.  The
    applicant  was  a  director  of  the  company  as  set  out.   In   the
    circumstances it would be irrational and not sensible  to  insist  that
    his name be included.

 9. The Rules 24 response from the respondent accepted that the order of Mr
    Justice McGowan stated 'It is reasonably arguable that  the  fact  that
    the initials SKT appear in  the  advertisement  is  enough  in  law  to
    satisfy the requirements that the applicant's name  appear'.   However,
    it was submitted that, the rule was clear that a name was required  and
    initials were not a name.  This could not possibly be construed as a de
    minimis failure.

10. Mr Malik submitted that in the context of the material presented to the
    judge the matter was de minimis.  The Rule was directed  towards  those
    who were self-employed whereby putting  the  name  was  sufficient.  If
    there was a non-compliance it was so inconsequential that it did equate
    to a de minims non compliance.

11. I agree that the Immigration Rules must  be  construed  in  a  sensible
    manner but I cannot agree that it would be irrational to insist on  the
    naming of the  appellant  within  the  advertisement.  As  Miss  Holmes
    pointed out, there is nothing in the determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge to indicate that he had made an  error.  The  judge  had
    considered  the  matter  with  considerable  care  and  had  noted  the
    stringent nature of the Rules at paragraph 37 of the decision.  He  had
    noted that it may be pedantic but it was mandatory and there was a need
    to ensure the connection between the applicant and the business and was
    not a de minimis issue. This conclusion by the judge was open to him on
    the fact before him.

12. I cannot accept Mr Malik's submissions that because the appellant is  a
    director of the company or his initials are present this is sufficient.
    The  Rule  is  clear  as  set  out  at  paragraph  42  of  the  judge's
    determination that the advertising or marketing material relied on must
    show the applicant's name (and the name of the business if applicable).

13. The rule at paragraph 41-SD(C)(3) of Appendix A and applicable  at  the
    date of the respondent's decision stated as follows:

         (c) if the applicant is applying under the  provisions  in  (d)  in
         Table 4 he must provide

         ...

         (iii) one or more of the following specified documents:-

           1) Advertising or marketing  material,  including  printouts  of
              online  advertising  that  has  been  published  locally   or
              nationally, showing the applicant name (and the name  of  the
              business if applicable) together with the business activity

           2) Article(s) or online links to Articles(s) in a  newspaper  or
              other publication showing the applicant's name (and the  name
              of the business if  applicable  together  with  the  business
              activity,

           3) Information from a trade fair (s) at which the applicant  has
              had a stand or given a presentation to market  his  business,
              showing the applicant's name (and the name of the business if
              applicable) together with the business activity , or

           4)

           5) Personal registration with  a  trade's  body  linked  to  the
              applicant's occupation

14. There was no indication that the appellant had complied with the  other
    alternative limbs of the rule. On the application  form  the  appellant
    had ticked G22 to show that he was relying on advertising or  marketing
    material.   The  first  requirement  under  (1)  above  was  that   the
    applicant's name should be shown and the name of  the  business  was  a
    secondary requirement  and  indeed  place  in  brackets.   Clearly  the
    identity of the appellant is a key factor in  the  application  and  he
    must be linked to the business itself.  I do not accept that this is  a
    de minimis requirement. That the appellant is linked personally to  the
    business is a fundamental requirement. A sensible reading of the  rules
    would indicate that the identity of the appellant is  critical  in  any
    such application.

15. Nor do I accept that the mere initials of the appellant which  are  the
    same as the company name can link the appellant to  that  company.   As
    pointed out the company will have a separate legal identity  hence  the
    importance of specifying the appellant's name  in  the  advertising  or
    marketing material.  The judge stated that  the  rule  maybe  pedantic,
    which I do not agree, but this is not a material error.  It is a  clear
    rule and was applicable at the date of the respondent's decision.

16. MD Jamaica was cited where the court held that  there was

         'nothing absurd in giving the rule its plain and ordinary  meaning.
         The principle de minimis non curat lex (the law  is  not  concerned
         with very small things)'.

    That case however addressed a temporal issue as the application was one
    day late and differed in nature and quality from the consideration here
    which was one of identity.  Nor is this even a 'near miss'.   The  name
    of the applicant was simply omitted from  the  marketing  material  and
    this  was  not  just  a  requirement  but  a  fundamental   requirement
    particularly as a company has, as I say, its  own  legal  identity.  As
    stated in Miah a rule is a rule and if a departure from a rule is truly
    de minimis the rule is considered to have been complied with  and  that
    is not the case here.

17. I find that there is no error of law in the judge's  determination  and
    that determination shall stand.
