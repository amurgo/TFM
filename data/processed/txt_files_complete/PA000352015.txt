                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Ms K McCarthy, instructed by Irving & Co.
Solicitors.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent, whom we shall call "the  claimant",  is  subject  to  a
    deportation decision made on 31 March 2015.  He gave notice  of  appeal
    to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  s.  82(1)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as  amended  by  the  Immigration  Act
    2014), as the decision letter invited him to do.   His  arguments  were
    successful before Judge Bird, who issued a determination  allowing  his
    appeal.
 2. The Secretary of State sought and obtained permission to appeal to this
    Tribunal on grounds based on an assertion that Judge  Bird  had  failed
    properly to apply the decision of the Supreme Court in HJ (Iran) v SSHD
    [2010] UKSC 31.  We heard submissions  on  6  July  2016.   During  the
    course of them it was drawn to the attention of the  parties  that  the
    decision under appeal appeared to fall within the 'Nkomo gap' (Nkomo  v
    SSHD [2016] UKUT 285 (IAC)).  We allowed the parties seven days to make
    any submissions persuading us that there was a right of appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal in this case.

 3. No such submissions have been made.  In this case, as in Nkomo and  for
    the same reasons, the Secretary of State  failed  to  make  a  decision
    carrying a right of appeal at the time it was made.  No doubt she  will
    wish to put the matter right now, and Mr Walker indicated  as  much  at
    the hearing.  For the present, however, our decision  has  to  be  that
    Judge Bird erred in determining the appeal.  We set her decision  aside
    and substitute a decision dismissing the claimant's appeal for want  of
    jurisdiction.
