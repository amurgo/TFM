                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The appellant is a male citizen of Libya born on [ ] 1940.  He  arrived
    in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2015 with a visit visa,  having  left
    Libya in the same month.  It is not in dispute that he originates  from
    Tripoli and has relatives in the village of Zuwara.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the  decision
    of the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  ("SSHD")  of  30
    October 2015 refusing his protection  and  human  rights  claims.   The
    appellant's wife, born January 1951, is a dependant on this appeal.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 3. For detailed reasons given in a decision promulgated on 9 January  2017
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  on  all
    grounds.   The  following  two  paragraphs  of  that  decision  are  of
    particular relevance:

         "80. I accept that Libya is not currently a country at  peace  with
             itself, and that there are areas  where  the  violence  is  so
             intense that it reaches the level anticipated by Article 15(c)
             of the Qualification Directive.  I also accept that  outbreaks
             of violence can occur in all areas of Libya but these  do  not
             pose such a severe risk so as to engage Article 15(c).  On the
             basis of the appellant's evidence I  find  that  the  area  in
             which he lives is not one where he would be at such a risk  of
             serious harm or death such as would engage Article 15(c).  The
             appellant has lived without problem in Tripoli  and  travelled
             freely through checkpoints without encountering problems. ...

         87.  I accept that the appellant may not want  to  live  in  Zuwara
             because it is a small village and there is  nothing  happening
             there but that is not a  sufficient  reason  for  a  grant  of
             international protection.  The appellant  and  his  wife  have
             always lived in Tripoli and although they are now of advancing
             years both had continued to work until they came to the UK  in
             April 2015.  I do not accept the appellant's evidence that  he
             no longer has any money because  he  provided  verified  proof
             when he applied for a visa to come to the UK  that  he  had  a
             pension income of ï¿½1,000 per month.  His two daughters live in
             Zuwara and he has extensive  extended  family  living  in  and
             around the area of Zuwara and Tripoli who  would  be  able  to
             assist them on return".

Setting aside of First-tier Tribunal's decision

 4. Upper Tribunal Judge Coker granted permission to appeal on 18 May  2017
    in the following terms:

         "2.  Although the First-tier Tribunal Judge correctly considers  FA
             (Libya: Article 15(c)) Libya CG [2016] UKUT  413  in  that  he
             acknowledges that it is  necessary  to  consider  the  current
             situation in Libya, it  is  arguable  the  judge  reached  his
             decision on the basis of the applicant's experiences  and  the
             situation at the time when he was last in Libya rather than in
             the light of the current situation i.e. at  the  date  of  the
             hearing".

 5. In her 'Rule 24' response  of  6  June  2017  the  Secretary  of  State
    asserted, inter alia, that "it did not appear that the appellant  [had]
    relied on any specific evidence in respect to the current situation  in
    Libya and the Secretary set out in detail her view...  in  her  refusal
    letter"

 6. This assertion is though, in part, inaccurate.  The appellant  produced
    a bundle of documents before the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  included
    within it reports relating to the situation in Libya.

 7. In particular the bundle contains a report of June 2016 from  the  Home
    Office headed "Country Information and  Guidance  Libya:  Security  and
    humanitarian protection" This report presents a  grim  picture  of  the
    humanitarian situation in Libya, identifying  a  deterioration  in  the
    general situation and, significantly, that certain categories of people
    are particularly vulnerable, including "the elderly".  A  later  report
    produced by the Home Office of March 2017, and served by the  Secretary
    of State on the First-tier Tribunal, did not identify  any  improvement
    in the situation.

 8. Given the evidence identified above  Ms  Isherwood  accepted  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in  failing  to  set  the  appellant's
    circumstances in the proper and  relevant  context  of  the  background
    country evidence that it had  before  it.  In  particular,  there  were
    aspects of that evidence that showed a  deteriorating  situation  since
    the time of the appellant's departure and that  "the  elderly"  were  a
    vulnerable group, a matter not alluded to by the FtT.

 9. It was undoubtedly incumbent upon the First-tier Tribunal  to,  at  the
    very least, engage with the aforementioned evidence  and  identify  why
    this appellant (and his wife), who can both quite properly be described
    as elderly, could not make out their case to be at risk, in the Article
    15(c) sense, upon return. It did not do so. It is clear that the First-
    tier Tribunal carried out the assessment of risk faced by the appellant
    on the basis of his past experiences  in  Libya  without  setting  this
    assessment in the context of the changing situation in that country.

10. For these reasons, I set aside  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Re-making of the decision under appeal

11. At the hearing, I directed that the decision under appeal be re-made by
    the Upper Tribunal

12. In this regard, I observe that subsequent to the date of the First-tier
    Tribunal's decision the Upper Tribunal has given detailed consideration
    to the situation in Libya, in ZMM (Article 15(c)) Libya CG [2017]  UKUT
    263, the head note to which reads as follows:

         "The  violence  in  Libya  has  reached  such  a  high  level  that
         substantial grounds  are  shown  for  believing  that  a  returning
         civilian would, solely on account of his presence on the  territory
         of that country or region, face a real risk of being subject  to  a
         threat to his life or person".

13. It is to be recalled, as identified above, that the appellant  and  his
    wife are in a particularly vulnerable category of person.  It  is  also
    relevant to identify, from paragraph 93 of the decision in ZMM, that:

         "We do not doubt that there are in Libya today towns  and  villages
         which are relatively calm  where  notwithstanding  the  absence  of
         effective government, people are going about  their  normal  lives.
         We cannot however be satisfied that the peace  in  these  oases  is
         stable or durable or that the notional returnee to Libya  would  be
         able to safely access such locations".

14. Given the terms of  the  decision  in  ZMM,  and  in  particular  those
    passages which I have identified above, Ms Isherwood indicated that she
    did not seek to resist a finding that the appellant would  be  entitled
    to a grant of humanitarian protection. I concur. When the  decision  in
    ZMM is applied to this appellant's  circumstances,  and  in  particular
    taking account the appellant's age, it is plain  that  the  appellant's
    return to Libya would be in breach of Article 15(c).

15. There is no Refugee Convention reason in this case and Mr  Hussain  did
    not seek to persuade me otherwise. In all the circumstances, the appeal
    is dismissed insofar as it was pursued on Refugee  Convention  grounds,
    but allowed on humanitarian protection grounds.

Decision

For the reasons given above:

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside

Upon the decision under appeal being re-made  by  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the
appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  on  humanitarian  protection  grounds  and
dismissed on all other grounds.
