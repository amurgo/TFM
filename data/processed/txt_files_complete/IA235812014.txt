Law


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  her
    decision to refuse leave to remain on family and private  life  grounds
    either under the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) or  outside  the
    Rules.



First-tier Tribunal decision

 2. The First-tier Tribunal heard the appeal in January 2014 and found,  so
    far as material, that the claimant was a Bangladeshi  citizen  born  in
    1980 who came to the United Kingdom as a student in December 2006. That
    visa expired on 31 August 2008.  An application  to  remain  under  the
    Tier  1  Post-Study  scheme  was  unsuccessful,  appeal  rights   being
    exhausted in January 2012.

 3. On 8 January 2012, the claimant and her partner, a British  citizen  of
    Bangladeshi origin, contracted an Islamic marriage at the  East  London
    Mosque. On 20 August 2012, the claimant lodged an application for leave
    to remain on family and private life grounds, based on her relationship
    with her husband. On 5 October 2012, the couple married in  a  registry
    office. The August 2012 application was refused with no right of appeal
    on 22 August 2013.

 4. On 13 May 2014, following judicial review proceedings, the Secretary of
    State made a further, appealable, decision refusing leave to remain  on
    Article 8 grounds, both under Appendix  FM  and  paragraph  276ADE  and
    outside  the  Rules  on  exceptionality  grounds.   The  basis  of  the
    exceptionality element of the  claim  was  the  care  provided  by  the
    claimant and her husband to his elderly parents living  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 5. The Judge found that there were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    couple relocating to Bangladesh, save for their role in caring for  the
    claimant's father-in-law. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that  the
    claimant's parents-in-law were supportive of the marriage.  Her father-
    in-law is registered disabled.  The claimant  and  her  husband  -  but
    principally the  claimant  -  looked  after  both  her  parents-in-law,
    cooking, cleaning, and helping with mobility in and outside  the  home.
    A same-sex carer was considered important for Islamic reasons.

 6. The claimant was taking anti-depressants because she was  stressed  and
    depressed by her lack of lawful status in the United Kingdom.  She  had
    suffered blackouts, suicidal ideation and memory difficulties, and  was
    referred for counselling by her GP.  She had seen a psychotherapist  to
    assist her. There is no up to date evidence about her mental health.

 7. The  claimant's  evidence  was  that  her  father  disapproved  of  her
    marriage: her husband  was  from  a  village  in  Sylhet,  whereas  the
    claimant was a city girl from Dhaka.  There were cultural and  language
    difficulties.  Her own mother, and her maternal aunt and uncle  in  the
    United Kingdom, supported the marriage, but  her  father  continued  to
    oppose it.  She feared that if she  were  removed  to  Bangladesh,  her
    father would prevent her getting entry clearance to return,  and  might
    try to make her  marry  elsewhere.   Her  understanding  was  that  her
    husband would not accompany her because  he  needed  to  care  for  her
    parents-in-law.  The couple would try for children of  their  own  once
    her status was resolved.

 8. The claimant's husband has lived in the United Kingdom all his life and
    all his friends are here.  The husband had a good  job  in  IT  in  the
    United Kingdom, with a salary of �30,000, and had held that job  for  8
    years:  he did not think he would get such a good  one  in  Bangladesh.
    He stated that although he was able to speak some Sylheti and  Bengali,
    he did not feel he spoke them well enough to live in Bangladesh.

 9. He had travelled to Bangladesh on 5 occasions in his lifetime, the last
    time in 2014 when he accompanied his father on a visit  to  their  home
    village.  The husband's family had a property in Sylhet, an  unoccupied
    flat in his home village, which was looked after there by a  caretaker.
    His evidence was that he  might  be  entitled  to  inherit  the  family
    property in Bangladesh when his  father  died,  but  that  he  was  not
    interested in doing so.

10. The husband had shoulder and knee problems, and blepharitis, for  which
    treatment in Bangladesh would not be free.  He had  3  brothers  and  2
    sisters in the United Kingdom and Germany, but the  claimant's  husband
    was the only one living in London. The couple  had  moved  out  of  his
    parents' home because they needed additional space: they went  to  live
    with the claimant's aunt for a time, and now had their own rented home.

11. The First-tier Tribunal's findings concerning  the  claimant's  parents
    are set out at paragraphs 38-40:

         "38. [The claimant's father-in-law'] says in his letter...that  the
         [claimant] is part of his family following her marriage to his son.
          He says that  the  [claimant]  visits  them  every  day  and  does
         cooking, cleaning and household jobs.  He and  his  wife  are  both
         unwell.  He had a traffic accident with a  serious  injury  to  his
         right leg and now permanently uses crutches to get around  and  his
         wife is due to have an operation on her  right  hand  shortly.   He
         says there is no one else to provide support except  the  [claimant
         and her husband].  The GP notes for [the claimant's  father-in-law]
         ...corroborate that he had a fracture of the femur and also set out
         that he has had a number of heart attacks and other heart problems,
         chronic kidney disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and epilepsy.
           [The  claimant's  father-in-law]  is  68  years   old.    ...[the
         claimant's husband] supports his father's day to day  needs;  helps
         him with his appointments and to manage  his  finances.   There  is
         also a letter from the DWP in the [Secretary  of  State's]  bundle,
         confirming [that the claimant's father-in-law] receives  Disability
         Living Allowance including elements for personal care  and  getting
         around.

         29.  I find that [the claimant's  father-in-law]  is  an  extremely
         unwell elderly  gentleman  with  multiple  care  needs,  which  are
         currently provided for on a daily basis by [the  claimant  and  her
         husband].  I accept that his wife is also elderly and not  able  to
         meet her husband's care needs. I find the evidence of [the claimant
         and her husband] that his siblings are not able to meet these needs
         as they do not live in London and have family commitments credible.
          I accept that [the claimant's parents-in-law] would be  distressed
         if these needs were met in their own home  by  non-family  members,
         particularly if the carers were of the opposite sex.  Whilst social
         services would no doubt make sure that medications were  taken  and
         make brief visits to ensure that [the claimant's father-in-law] was
         safe, they would not offer the complete service performed  by  [the
         claimant and her husband], for instance including the  managing  of
         finances. Social services could  not  provide  the  same  level  of
         individualised care - for instance buying the precise shopping  and
         making the precise  meals  [the  claimant's  parents-in-law]  like.
         Social services carers certainly  could  not  offer  the  level  of
         companionship which [the claimant and her husband] provide  through
         their family  relationship  and  by  virtue  of  understanding  and
         speaking Sylheti/Bengali and the time they are able to give.

         40.  I find that given  the  long-term,  daily  commitment  to  the
         personal care for [the claimant's parents-in-law] in the context of
         [the claimant's father-in-law's] very  serious  ill  health  it  is
         right to conclude that  this  is  an  exceptional  case  where  the
         relationship of both  [the  claimant  and  her  husband]  to  these
         elderly parents and the role they perform in their lives means that
         there would  be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  their  family  life
         continuing outside the United Kingdom. "

12. The Judge allowed the appeal within the Rules, holding  that  the  care
    given to the claimant's parents-in-law amounted  to  an  insurmountable
    obstacle to her removal to Bangladesh and that she met the requirements
    of Appendix FM.  At paragraph 41 of her decision, she noted the factors
    under section 117B of the 2002 Act, prefacing  her  remarks  with  'for
    completeness' but it is plain from that language and from  the  context
    that she did not take into account the part VA factors before  reaching
    her conclusion on Appendix FM and Article 8 within the Rules.

Permission to appeal

13. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal  on  the  basis
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had arguably erred  in  law  in  the
    application of the criteria in section 117B of the 2002 account and the
    weight attached to those criteria at  paragraph  41  of  the  decision.
    When granting permission, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  PJM  Hollingworth
    considered that 'an arguable error of law arises in relation to whether
    the statutory criteria should permeate the reasoning in the decision to
    a greater extent than being noted for completeness'.

14. That was the basis on which the appeal came before me, initially for  a
    decision on material error of law, and now for substantive remaking  of
    the decision.

Upper Tribunal proceedings

Material error of law decision

15. On 24 July 2015 I found a material error of law and gave directions for
    the future conduct of this appeal.  I did so for  two  reasons:  first,
    because at paragraph 32 of her decision, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    had misdirected herself in treating as spent the claimant's  conviction
    for shoplifting, contrary to the provisions of section 56A of the Legal
    Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO  2012),  and
    second, because I considered that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
    failed correctly to direct herself by reference to  the  provisions  of
    part VA of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended), in particular sub-paragraphs 117B(4) and 117B(5).

16. The error in respect of section  56A  of  LASPO  2012  means  that  the
    Secretary of State was entitled to find that  the  claimant  could  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules since as a convicted shoplifter, the
    Secretary of State was entitled to find that she did  not  come  within
    the suitability requirements.

17. The claimant has not challenged the First-tier Tribunal's finding  that
    there were no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  her  returning  with  her
    partner to Bangladesh other than the circumstances of  her  parents-in-
    law.

18. The question remains whether the circumstances  of  her  parents-in-law
    are such as to  bring  into  play  Nagre/Gulshan  exceptionality.   The
    remaking of the appeal was expressly limited to  the  question  whether
    the support which the claimant and her partner provide for his  parents
    in the United Kingdom amounts to exceptional circumstances  in  respect
    of which the Secretary of State should have exercised her discretion to
    grant leave to remain outside the Rules pursuant to Article 8 ECHR.

19 November 2015 hearing

19. The appeal came before me for hearing on 19 November 2015.  It was  not
    ready for hearing, due principally to the claimant's solicitors failure
    to follow the 24 July directions and agree a bundle  of  documents  for
    the  hearing  with  the  Secretary  of  State's  representative.    The
    directions given at the 24 July 2015 hearing, with the agreement of the
    parties, were as follows:

         "(1) The appeal will be listed for the first available date with  a
         time estimate of 2 hours.  No interpreter is required.

         (2)  Not later than 7 days before the resumed hearing, the  parties
         shall file skeleton arguments setting out all arguments and matters
         on which they seek to rely at the hearing, together  with  a  joint
         bundle of documents, not to exceed  150  pages  without  the  prior
         leave of the Tribunal. "

20. As the hearing was to be on 19 November  2015,  the  agreed  bundle  of
    documents should have been filed by 12 November 2015 and efforts should
    have been made on behalf of the  claimant  to  agree  it  before  then.
    Nothing happened.

21. On Friday 13 November 2015, Mr  Parkinson,  who  had  conduct  of  this
    appeal, endeavoured to discover whether further  documents  were  being
    produced, by telephoning the claimant's solicitors.  No documents  were
    then forthcoming.  Mr Parkinson was unable to appear for the  Secretary
    of State on Thursday 19 November 2015, and she was  represented  by  Mr
    Tufan.

22. Two bundles of documents were filed by the claimant's solicitors on  16
    November 2015, without any attempt to agree them or make them available
    to the Secretary of State in advance.  They were linked  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal file in my possession  on  18  November  2015.   Both  parties
    handed up skeleton arguments at the hearing.

23. It became clear that the claimant intended to  call  2  witnesses,  the
    claimant and her husband, and to rely on a significant  number  of  new
    documents  not  previously  seen  by  Mr  Tufan  or  Mr  Parkinson.   I
    considered that the only proper course having regard to the  overriding
    objective was to  adjourn  this  hearing  for  as  short  a  period  as
    possible.

24. I therefore directed that the appeal be relisted before me on the first
    open day with reference to the availability of Counsel, Mr Burnett, and
    made further relevant directions, reserving the question  of  costs  to
    the substantive hearing. The hearing was relisted for  remaking  on  21
    December 2015.

21 December 2015 hearing

25. At this hearing, the Secretary of State  was  represented  by  Mr  John
    Parkinson.  The claimant and her husband gave oral  evidence  and  were
    cross-examined.  The skeleton arguments served at  the  hearing  on  19
    November 2015 stood as skeleton arguments for the 21 December hearing.

26. In reaching my decision, I have had regard to all of  the  written  and
    oral evidence  before  me,  whether  or  not  I  have  referred  to  it
    expressly.  I have  also  taken  into  account  the  written  and  oral
    submissions of Mr Parkinson for the Secretary of State and  Mr  Burnett
    for the claimant.

Claimant's evidence

27. The claimant adopted her witness  statement  of  November  2014.   That
    statement was the one which was before the First-tier Tribunal  and  is
    taken into account in the First-tier Tribunal's findings.  There is  no
    need therefore to set it out in detail  here.   The  claimant  had  not
    prepared an updated statement, but she had prepared what she  described
    as a Care Plan, with the assistance of her  husband,  setting  out  the
    kind of tasks that they both carry out for her parents-in-law.

28. In cross-examination, the claimant said that she had come to the United
    Kingdom in 2006 to study and had done so. Her father had paid  for  her
    studies. The claimant confirmed that she had another sponsor, an  uncle
    in Bangladesh, whose business was good and who was able to produce  the
    required evidence of �50,000 in a bank  account.   Her  uncle  and  her
    father were in business together but the  funds  were  in  her  uncle's
    account, not her father's, so he had to help. The claimant had 7  aunts
    and 6 uncles in Bangladesh, including that uncle.

29. The claimant's father in Bangladesh spoke both Bengali and English; his
    written English and his understanding of the language were better  than
    his spoken English.  Her aunt, who had also supplied  an  affidavit  in
    English, spoke the language.  The claimant had 2 maternal aunts  living
    in Birmingham.  They had not approved  of  her  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom as a single woman, considering that  unsafe:  they  would  have
    preferred for her to come with a husband.  She  had  not  accepted  any
    help from them until 2009/2010 when the relationship  between  her  and
    her aunts had improved.

30. The claimant stated that she was scared of her father  and  had  always
    hidden things from him, including the missing  �1500  which  her  first
    college asserted it had not received  for  her  fees,  causing  her  to
    transfer  her  studies  to  Cambridge  College  of  Learning,  on   the
    recommendation of a friend.  She had undertaken a Business  Information
    Technology Diploma course at Cambridge College of Learning, then  begun
    studying Chartered Accountancy at  Kaplan  Financial  in  approximately
    2008, or perhaps January or February 2009, she could not be sure.   She
    agreed that her Tier 1 application had been made on 29 August 2008.

31. Asked whether the reason that application had been refused  related  to
    the Cambridge College of Learning course, which the Secretary of  State
    did not accept was genuine, the claimant asserted that she had  studied
    it as claimed.  She was unaware of the problems with that college.  She
    had gone there on the recommendation of a  friend  and  studied  for  a
    Postgraduate Diploma in Information Technology.  She  believed  herself
    to be an honest witness in this respect.

32. The claimant expanded on the difficulties with her father in Dhaka.  He
    had identified a suitable husband for her there.  The claimant had  not
    returned to her family: she wanted to  fight  to  stay  in  the  United
    Kingdom and her application was pending.  She wanted  to  resolve  that
    and then make a decision about whether to return  to  Bangladesh.   Her
    father had asked her to leave everything in the United Kingdom and come
    home,  but  she  had  refused.   Fortunately,  the  proposed   marriage
    arrangement in Bangladesh had broken down and now her relationship with
    her father was improving.

33.  She  had  not  read  her  father's  affidavit,  which  she  considered
    'pathetic', and she wondered how he could say  such  things.   She  was
    surprised and disappointed to learn that her father considered that she
    had begun to have a bad life, was beyond his control, and had left  for
    England without informing him and without his consent:  her father knew
    perfectly well that he was her financial sponsor for her  studies  here
    and that she came with his consent and permission.  She  had  not  read
    the affidavit at all.

34. The claimant had represented herself  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    relation to the Tier 1 application and won.  However,  when  notice  of
    the decision came through, she was  staying  in  Birmingham  where  her
    grandmother was visiting her aunt, and she did not  receive  notice  of
    the Upper Tribunal hearing until after it had taken place.   She  lost.
    She attempted to appeal in person to the Court of Appeal but again  was
    unsuccessful. She did not embark, despite having no leave: in 2010, she
    met her now husband and wanted to marry him. He  proposed  in  February
    2011 and the Islamic  marriage  was  in  January  2012.  Her  husband's
    paternal relatives were all in the  United  Kingdom  and  his  maternal
    relatives in America.  As far as she knew, her husband had no relatives
    in Bangladesh.

35. After the Islamic marriage, she approached a barrister to get a  spouse
    visa.  She had been working all the time  up  to  this  point  but  the
    barrister told her that as she did not have leave to remain, she should
    not do so, and the claimant then stopped working.  She stated that  she
    had never worked more than 20 hours a week.  If she  were  again  given
    leave which entitled her to work, the claimant would leave it up to her
    husband whether she should continue to care for her parents-in-law,  or
    go to work.

36. The couple did not need wages from the claimant:   her  husband  earned
    good money and maintained her well, so she  had  no  need  to  work  at
    present.  It was true that as a couple they did  have  some  loans  and
    credit card bills, telephone bills and so  on,  but  they  were  paying
    those off gradually.  The  claimant  was  asked  about  the  Individual
    Voluntary Arrangement into which her husband had entered: she said  she
    understood that it would be a criminal offence if they did not keep  up
    the payments.  She knew they had debts but her husband dealt  with  the
    banking and financial matters.

37. The claimant and her husband had not contacted social services  to  see
    what additional help might be available for her parents-in-law.  He was
    entirely against that.  Social services help was already in  place  for
    her father-in-law but not her mother-in-law.   Her  husband  complained
    all the time of the way his father was treated by social services:  the
    nurse came once a day to look after her  father-in-law's  legs,  change
    bandages and so forth.  Her  mother-in-law  helped,  but  it  needed  a
    professional to deal with the leg ulcers.  At present, no  visits  were
    required because her father-in-law had been  admitted  to  hospital  on
    Thursday or Friday of the preceding week: her husband had  stayed  with
    him all night when he was admitted.   His  doctor  considered  that  he
    needed observation for 2 weeks at least.

38. The claimant is pregnant, as evidenced by documents in the bundle.  She
    underwent an antenatal combined test on 10 November 2015, and  said  in
    answer to questions from me that she was then about 11 weeks  pregnant.
    The claimant's expected date  of  delivery  may  be  deduced  from  her
    maternity exemption certificate which is due to expire a year after the
    birth and bears an expiry date of 22 May 2017,  so  that  the  baby  is
    expected to arrive in May 2016.

Claimant's husband's evidence

39. The claimant's husband adopted his statement of 15 May 2015, which  was
    supplemental to the statement before the First-tier Tribunal.   In  his
    new statement, the husband set out the circumstances as  they  were  in
    May 2015.

40. The husband had been looking after both of his parents and  caring  for
    them since he was 18 years  old.   If  he  and  his  wife  returned  to
    Bangladesh, he did not see why his parents should be forced  to  choose
    between their care and that of social services.  It was well documented
    in national media that social  services  are  at  breaking  point,  and
    family care was much better.  He and his wife cared  for  his  parents'
    physical and emotional needs, which social services would not do.

41. His father had suffered a transient ischaemic attack (a type  of  heart
    attack) and was partially paralysed on his left side.  He  had  in  the
    past had several heart attacks and had 3 arterial stents.  He had  been
    diabetic for almost two decades and required insulin injections to cope
    with that and now had a chronic diabetic leg ulcer  requiring  surgical
    debridement, blood transfusion, and a two week stay in  the  specialist
    vascular ward at the Royal London Hospital.  His father also had  Stage
    3 chronic kidney disease and chronic  pancreatitis,  and  labile  blood
    pressure of long standing, which required close  monitoring  given  the
    number of medicines required to regulate it.

42. His father's femur fracture after the car accident had required lengthy
    surgery and 5 weeks at the Royal London Hospital, but due to the  onset
    of osteoporosis and vascular disease, it had healed poorly. His  father
    had a pronounced limp and exceptional pain levels for  many  years.   A
    bone graft was being discussed but would not be appropriate  until  his
    father was in better health.  The  claimant's  husband  understood  all
    these conditions well and knew what was required to alleviate his pain:
    he would be surprised if any other carer could quickly  understand  and
    take responsibility for all of them.

43. His parents, both British citizens  for  many  decades,  could  not  be
    expected to accompany him and the claimant  if  they  left  the  United
    Kingdom: they had 5 children here, including  the  claimant's  husband,
    and if they  left,  the  rest  of  his  siblings  would  have  to  make
    arrangements to live in Bangladesh too, or take their  annual  holidays
    only there, in order to maintain contact.  His parents had no family in
    Bangladesh now. His parents would not be able to move to Bangladesh due
    to their health, and if they did, he was unlikely to earn enough to pay
    for  their  medical  care  in  Bangladesh.  The  treatment  his  father
    currently received, including operations, would not be free there as it
    is in the United Kingdom.

44. His father had travelled to  Bangladesh  in  2014  against  family  and
    medical advice,  and  that  was  when  his  ulcerated  leg  had  become
    infected.  Appropriate medical care was unavailable in Bangladesh  when
    his father tried to access it. His father had  had  to  return  to  the
    United Kingdom for proper care.  The infection continued  and  remained
    dangerous to his father's health, but his father was  slowly  improving
    under their care. Social  services  could  not  cope  with  his  father
    unaided: his wife had to help the nurse every day  as  they  could  not
    spare 2 nurses to change the bandages.  His  father  now  accepted  his
    doctor's advice that he would never be able to travelling  outside  the
    United Kingdom again.

45. The claimant and her husband had moved out of his parents' home because
    his father needed one bedroom  and  his  mother  another,  due  to  his
    father's health problems.  The small remaining bedroom was insufficient
    for the claimant and her husband to sleep, or for him to work from home
    when he needed to.   They  had  managed  to  cope  in  those  difficult
    circumstances for over a year.   They  remained  actively  involved  in
    caring for his father, particularly  the  claimant,  now  that  she  no
    longer worked, and they lived only a short drive away.

46. The husband claimed not to speak the languages of Bangladesh or to have
    any knowledge or experience of the country.  He had never  lived  there
    and could not understand why he was expected to do so,  simply  because
    his wife was in the United Kingdom illegally when he married  her.   He
    would be like a foreigner, and the lifestyle was not at all  what  they
    were used to.  His evidence was that the claimant's father objected  to
    the marriage on the basis that they were of different castes.

47. In the United Kingdom, the husband had worked for  City  and  Islington
    College for 8 years and had professional  friendships  with  colleagues
    there, as well as having attended numerous courses to help him  improve
    his work and be a better person. He had  professional  responsibilities
    at work, as well as personal  responsibilities  to  his  parents.   The
    claimant had applied for a promotion and was waiting for an  interview.
    If he were successful, his salary would be increased, which would  help
    his life and that of his wife and family.  Interviews were due to  take
    place in July 2015.

48. If he were to leave the United Kingdom, which, he stated, he could  not
    and  would  not  do,  it  was  unclear  who   would   take   over   his
    responsibilities.  His siblings had all moved away from London to study
    and would not know how to look after his parents,  even  if  they  were
    willing to do so, and they had their own  responsibilities.   The  Home
    Office should suggest where they could live in Bangladesh,  given  that
    they had no family support available on either side and  there  was  no
    welfare system in Bangladesh.

49. The couple's financial position in the United  Kingdom  was  difficult.
    They had many debts, about �8000 in total.  His United  Kingdom  family
    were not under any legal obligation to pay these debts.  He set out his
    commitments, which included a direct debit for his  outstanding  credit
    card debt and another for a loan from City and Islington College.   The
    couple wished to pay off their debts as soon as they  could  but  would
    not be able to do so if they left the United Kingdom.

50. The husband was awaiting surgery on his injured shoulder, in  which  he
    had torn a muscle and cracked a shoulder blade.  That surgery would  be
    free in the United Kingdom but would not be free in Bangladesh: because
    of the need to repair the shoulder blade, his rehabilitation time would
    be long.  In the meantime, the husband was receiving regular injections
    from the hospital to control the pain.

51. The husband was then tendered for cross-examination.  He stated that he
    was an IT manager in a higher education college.  He had 5 siblings but
    they were not really in touch.  His  older  sister  lived  in  Scotland
    somewhere, and he was  estranged  from  his  other  sister,  who  lived
    somewhere in Germany.  His mother's  family  were  all  in  the  United
    States.  His father only had one brother: his paternal uncle had died a
    couple of years ago.   He confirmed that his only contact  with  social
    services was in relation to his father's care plan for wound  dressing.
    He also had to contact them often about  missed  appointments.   Social
    services said they did not have enough staff to provide more  care  and
    that his father was not a priority for them.  He had  never  approached
    social services to see what would be available if his wife were not his
    father's carer.

52. The husband stated that he was providing for his wife and that both  of
    them cared for his parents.  They lived 5-10 minutes away and  were  at
    his parents' home every single day.  The claimant was there  from  when
    the husband went to work, until his return in the evening.  His  mother
    did very little, because now she  had  cysts  in  her  wrists  so  that
    movement was quite restricted.  Her mother was everything to his father
    but she herself needed help with bathing and could not walk far. If the
    claimant were granted leave to remain and could work, she would not  do
    so.

53. His father had been destroyed by the leg ulcer:  he could not now  walk
    properly and was in hospital with fluid on his lungs, liver,  and  both
    his legs.  His leg ulcer had returned to the way it was before  it  was
    debrided,  he  had  stage  3  kidney  disease,  and  the  doctors  were
    considering what options remained.  His father had experienced 4  heart
    attacks and 2 strokes: the last heart attack had been 5 years  ago  and
    the strokes even longer ago.

54. The husband's father suffered from varicose veins, high blood pressure,
    and took around 30 tablets 3 times a day.  He had type 2  diabetes  and
    needed 4 insulin injections a day.  His medication was constantly being
    changed by the GP: the GP would visit, or the claimant would  take  her
    father-in-law  to  the  surgery.   His  father  was   taking   diuretic
    medication to deal with the fluid on his lungs and liver.  Recently, he
    had not taken his medication for almost 2 weeks  and  that  had  caused
    spasms.

55. His parents' home had been flooded but the  council  would  not  assist
    them with the damage. The medical evidence in the bundle concerning the
    claimant's father-in-law was wrong.  The assessment was out of date and
    he was now in much worse health. His father needed help to  dress,  and
    no longer went outside to pray, saying his prayers on the sofa instead.
     He could still go to the lavatory and perform both functions  himself.



56. If the claimant were returned to Bangladesh,  the  husband  said  first
    that he would have to stay and care for his parents.   If  he  went  to
    Bangladesh, he would lose his college job.   He  was  being  forced  to
    choose between his parents, his wife, and his unborn child.  He had not
    really considered what he would do, but 'if push came to shove I  would
    have to do something'.

57. There was no re-examination.

Submissions

58. For the Secretary  of  State,  Mr  Parkinson  relied  on  his  skeleton
    argument.  There were significant issues of immigration control in this
    appeal and the Secretary of State did not  accept  that  people  should
    fail to attend college when admitted to do so then  simply  do  nothing
    about it.  The claimant's father's affidavit should not  be  given  any
    weight since it was factually inaccurate: the claimant had not got into
    bad ways and left for the United Kingdom without his permission, on the
    contrary, her father and uncle had sponsored her to come here  and  she
    had done so with their knowledge and approval.

59. He relied on the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  NA  &  Others
    (Cambridge College of Learning) Pakistan [2009] UKAIT 00031 in relation
    to the course which the claimant said she had attended.   NA  &  Others
    found that:

         "Cambridge College of Learning  (CCOL)  never  ran  a  Postgraduate
         Diploma in Business Management course or a Postgraduate Diploma  in
         IT course. Accordingly for a person applying for  leave  to  remain
         under the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) scheme to rely on a  certificate
         of an award of such a diploma following a course will amount  to  a
         false representation and so will fall foul of para 322(1A)  of  the
         Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC  395.  Such  a  person
         will also be unable to meet the requirements of para  245Z  because
         he or she could never have undertaken such a course."

    The claimant's statement that she had studied for a Diploma in IT there
    could not be relied upon and it followed that she had used deception in
    order to gain further leave.

60. The connection between the claimant and her parents-in-law amounted  to
    private life, not family life, and had been developed while she was  in
    the United Kingdom  unlawfully,  or  at  best,  precariously.  It  must
    therefore be given little weight, applying section  117B(4)(a)  of  the
    2002 Act.  Further, it was clear from the claimant's witness  statement
    that she began looking after  her  parents-in-law  only  once  she  was
    unable to work.

61. Neither the claimant nor her husband had made any attempt  to  discover
    what social care packages might be  available  to  her  parents-in-law.
    They had no right to expect to receive care from someone with no  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom, and appropriate care would, he argued,
    be available from social services. There was  no  up  to  date  medical
    evidence about the condition of the claimant's father-in-law or mother-
    in-law: the evidence before the Tribunal was a series of assertions  in
    written and oral evidence, and the medical evidence in the  bundle  was
    acknowledged to be out of date.  As at 11  November  2015,  the  letter
    from the claimant's father-in-law stated that  she  'helped'  his  wife
    with chores and shopping, not that she undertook them exclusively.

62. Mr Parkinson noted that the 'no insurmountable  obstacles'  finding  in
    relation to the couple relocating to  Bangladesh  had  been  preserved.
    This was not a Chikwamba case:  the claimant here  had  a  particularly
    poor immigration history and had remained for many years without leave.
     There was no certainty that an application for entry  clearance  as  a
    spouse would succeed: the Secretary  of  State  would  be  entitled  to
    refuse to grant entry clearance on the basis that she had intentionally
    frustrated immigration control and  used  deception.  He  asked  me  to
    dismiss the appeal.

63. On the question of costs, the claimant's conduct  in  relation  to  the
    previous hearing was a plain breach  of  directions  and  Mr  Parkinson
    asked the Upper Tribunal to order the claimant to pay the Secretary  of
    State's costs of that hearing.

64. For the claimant, Mr Burnett sought to persuade me that I was not bound
    by, nor entitled to rely upon, the Upper Tribunal's finding in  NA  and
    others that Cambridge College of Learning had never taught  the  course
    the claimant said she studied.  He asked  me  to  accept  the  father's
    affidavit as genuine and a truthful representation of a salient and key
    issue, that he had formally disowned her.  It  need  not  be  factually
    accurate: her father might have heard  that  the  claimant  was  to  be
    removed to Bangladesh and need to justify  his  position  before  other
    family members there.  The question turned on the  credibility  of  the
    claimant overall.

65. The evidence was now that the claimant was pregnant and if removed  she
    would have to cope with her  pregnancy  without  family  support.   Her
    father had disowned her, she was married to a British citizen, and  she
    was involved in caring for her parents-in-law.  The test of exceptional
    compassionate circumstances was made out and the claimant, on Chikwamba
    principles, should not have to make an application from Bangladesh  for
    re-entry to the United Kingdom.  Her  husband  was  earning  enough  to
    support her and enough to satisfy the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  They  were  in  a  valid,  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage.

66. In relation to costs, he relied on the statement of  truth  from  Abdul
    Hasad Chowdhury and on the small Costs Submission Bundle.  The claimant
    should not have to pay  the  costs  of  that  hearing  and  indeed,  Mr
    Chowdhury's statement sought the claimant's costs of the adjournment to
    be paid by the Secretary of State.

Discussion

67. I deal first with the costs point.  The claimant was represented at the
    hearing on 24 July 2015 and throughout.  There was a plain direction to
    agree a bundle of documents which  could  not  be  met  by  serving  an
    unagreed bundle, even had that taken place 7 days before the hearing as
    I directed.  The lateness of the bundle, and the failure to  agree  it,
    was the sole reason why that hearing was adjourned.

68. The statement of Mr Chowdhury indicates that his firm did not begin  to
    prepare bundles for the substantive  hearing  until  4  November  2015.
    However, as stated at paragraph 7, on  11  November  2015  the  husband
    provided scanned copies of the documents to be adduced at  the  resumed
    hearing.  Those documents could have been disclosed by email and agreed
    by Mr Parkinson on 12 November 2015, especially as the evidence is that
    Mr Parkinson was actively  preparing  the  appeal  and  telephoned  the
    claimant's solicitors on 13 November seeking to agree the bundle or  at
    least discover what evidence would be relied upon at the hearing 6 days
    later.

69. I am not remotely satisfied by Mr Chowdhury's explanation of his firm's
    failure to comply with the direction made on 24 July 2015. Put  at  its
    highest, in paragraph 18 he says the unagreed bundle was  delivered  to
    the Secretary of State 3 days before the resumed hearing. As  indicated
    at the hearing, and having regard to the guidance in Secretary of State
    for the Home Department v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387  and  JA
    (Ghana) v The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 1031 regarding compliance with directions, I am satisfied  that  it
    is appropriate to order the claimant to pay the  Secretary  of  State's
    costs of the hearing on 19 November 2015, to be assessed if not agreed.

70. Turning to the substance of this appeal, the first point  is  that  the
    claimant cannot succeed under the Rules.  That is no longer in dispute:
    she has a  shoplifting  conviction  and  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    entitled to rely upon that.  It also appears that she used deception in
    relation to the Cambridge College of Learning diploma which she alleges
    she studied.

71. The finding that there are no insurmountable obstacles to the  claimant
    and  her  husband  living  in  Bangladesh,  save  in  relation  to  the
    circumstances of her parents-in-law, was expressly preserved.

72. I turn, therefore, to consider whether  the  care  which  the  claimant
    provides for her parents-in-law is such as  to  amount  to  exceptional
    circumstances.  I remind  myself  that  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls is in the public interest and there is no doubt in
    my mind that this claimant has flouted those controls on more than  one
    occasion.  She has remained in the United  Kingdom  for  over  7  years
    since she last had extant leave in August 2008.

73. The claimant speaks English and is not a burden on  taxpayers,  because
    her husband keeps her.  The private life which she has established with
    her parents-in-law attracts little weight, because it  was  established
    when she was in the United Kingdom unlawfully, or at  best  (while  her
    Tier 1 application was pending), precariously.

74. Nor am I satisfied that the services which she performs for her father-
    in-law amount to exceptional or compelling circumstances.  It  is  true
    that he is not young, and that he suffers  from  a  number  of  medical
    conditions.  There is no proper medical report  on  his  condition  but
    there is an Adult Community Health  Team  Initial  Assessment,  showing
    that he has bilateral leg ulcers, adequate housing, and lives with  his
    wife.  He has 'family support', presumably a reference not just to  his
    wife but to his son and the claimant. Under 'mobility'  the  assessment
    indicates that the claimant's father-in-law is mobile at  home,  mobile
    outside the home with aid, can transfer independently from chair to bed
    and bathe himself.  He has a limited range of movement but he  had  not
    fallen in the last year.   He is independent in  the  toilet,  able  to
    perform personal care, and his family does his  shopping,  laundry  and
    housework. The copy report is incomplete since at  the  bottom  of  the
    second page there is a heading 'Roles and Routines' but the rest of the
    form, including the date  and  signature,  is  missing.   There  is  no
    evidence from the patient's GP  or  his  social  services  carers,  and
    nothing recent.

75. The evidence concerning the claimant's care for  her  father-in-law  is
    weak and what she does (as set out in  the  'care  plan'  she  and  her
    husband prepared) is not incapable of being performed by someone  else.
    The weakest point in this element of the case is that the parties  have
    made no attempt to discover what packages  could  be  put  together  to
    assist her father-in-law, when and if he is discharged  from  hospital,
    and that, in fact, at the date of hearing the obligation to look  after
    him was in abeyance since he was in hospital, not at home.  When he  is
    discharged in due course, there presumably will be a further assessment
    of his needs as they then stand.

76. The only other issue is the claimant's pregnancy.  I note that  in  her
    witness statement in October 2014, she stated that she and her  husband
    would start a family when her status was settled.  It appears that they
    have changed their mind and that the claimant  became  pregnant  in  or
    around the beginning of September 2015.   That  may  present  practical
    difficulties for the Secretary of State in removing her  to  Bangladesh
    but the Secretary of State has not yet had any opportunity  to  make  a
    decision about that because no further submissions have been made about
    the pregnancy and any attendant difficulties.

77. Pregnancy for a married woman is not an exceptional circumstance.   The
    claimant did not rely on her pregnancy in her evidence in chief  or  in
    cross-examination until I asked her about the dates, nor is  it  relied
    upon in her skeleton argument. Having regard to the husband's  evidence
    that he has not really considered what he would do if  this  appeal  is
    unsuccessful but that 'he would have to do something' and  the  finding
    that there are no insurmountable obstacles to them living in Bangladesh
    together, I do not consider that the claimant's  pregnancy  amounts  to
    Nagre exceptional or compassionate circumstances.

78. The evidence before  me  is  not  sufficient  to  establish  compelling
    exceptional and compassionate circumstances for which, on Nagre/Gulshan
    principles, the removal of this claimant from the United Kingdom  would
    be disproportionate and therefore unlawful.

Decision

79. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

80. I substitute a decision dismissing the appeal on all grounds.

81. The claimant shall pay the Secretary of State's costs of the hearing of
    19 October 2015, to be assessed if not agreed, on the standard basis.
