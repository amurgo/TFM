Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr H Pratt, WTB Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
Appellant or the children in this determination identified as EN, T1, A  and
T2. This direction applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to
comply  with  this  direction  could  give  rise  to   contempt   of   court
proceedings

      1. On 11th January 2018, I heard submissions from  both  parties  and,
         for reasons set out below in a decision promulgated on 12th January
         2018, I found an error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal and set aside the decision to be remade.


                            Error of law decision


               1. The appellant's human rights claim was considered  by  the
                  respondent in response to the service of a s120 notice and
                  was refused for reasons set out in a decision  dated  17th
                  November 2016. His human rights appeal  was  dismissed  by
                  First-tier Tribunal judge Brookfield for reasons  set  out
                  in a decision promulgated on 9th October 2017.


               2. The appellant sought and was granted permission to  appeal
                  on the grounds that, having found that the appellant had a
                  genuine and subsisting relationship  with  his  two  older
                  British Citizen  sons,  it  was  arguable  the  First-tier
                  Tribunal judge had  erred  in  law  because  he  had  then
                  dismissed the appeal on the basis that the  appellant  was
                  not  the  full-time  carer  and/or  did  not   have   sole
                  responsibility for them.  The judge  did  not,  in  terms,
                  address s117B(6) Nationality Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
                  2002.  Nor  did  he  make  a  clear  finding  whether  the
                  appellant was an illegal entrant or an overstayer and thus
                  fell to be able to be considered under paragraph  EX.1  of
                  Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


               3. The respondent's Rule 24 response referred  to  occasional
                  visits by the two children to the appellant  although  the
                  appellant's evidence that the two  children  spend  school
                  holidays with him was accepted by the judge.


               4. Mr Bates referred to the finding  by  the  judge  that  it
                  would not be unreasonable for the children to leave the UK
                  and/or to visit the appellant in  the  USA  and  that  the
                  findings  overall  were  such  as  to  fall   within   the
                  reasonable range of findings to be made by  a  judge  that
                  did not disturb the overall conclusion that the  appellant
                  should be dismissed.


               5. The decision by the judge is  lengthy  and  sets  out  the
                  evidence before him. The judge concludes the appellant  is
                  a US citizen rather than a Mozambique citizen.  There  has
                  been no finding whether the appellant is an overstayer  or
                  an illegal entrant. There is no consideration by the judge
                  of the respondent's  policy  in  connection  with  British
                  Citizen  children.  The  decision  is  predicated  upon  a
                  finding that the two children can visit the  appellant  in
                  whichever country he goes to  live  in  but  it  does  not
                  assess the reasonableness of such a course  of  action  or
                  whether that is in the  best  interest  of  the  children,
                  given the finding that they spend their holidays with him.


               6. The failure of the judge to consider and make findings  on
                  s117B(6), whether the appellant is or is  not  an  illegal
                  entrant and whether paragraph EX.1 applies and if so  what
                  the consequences of that are, is a material error  of  law
                  and I set aside the decision to be remade by me.


    2.   I made the following directions:


               1. The respondent to file and serve the PNC.


               2. Appellant have leave to file and  serve  updating  witness
                  statements and any supporting documentation, including any
                  documentation  relating  to  passport  applications,  such
                  witness statements whether by him or others  to  stand  as
                  evidence in chief.


      3. The respondent filed and served the PNC prior to 24th January 2018.
         The appellant's witness statement was filed on the morning of  24th
         January 2018; Mr Bates did not object to  its  late  filing  and  I
         accepted the late evidence. No other evidence was filed.


      4. Mr EN attended  the  hearing  but  was  not  called  to  give  oral
         evidence, the  issues  before  me  being  matters  for  submission.
         Findings by the First-tier Tribunal judge, who heard evidence  from
         the appellant and his ex-partner (the mother of  A  and  T1)  which
         were not challenged, and are preserved are as follows:


               i) The appellant has three sons: T2 born 11 November 2011;  A
                  born 13 April 2005 and T1 born 21 January 2002.
              ii) The appellant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
                  with A and T1 his two older sons, who spend  their  school
                  holidays  with  him  and  with  whom  he  maintains  daily
                  contact;
             iii) He does not have a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
                  with T2.
              iv) He is not the primary carer of  and  does  not  have  sole
                  responsibility for any of the children.


      5. The respondent in the reasons for refusal takes the view  that  the
         appellant is a US citizen. She has no record of his entry to the UK
         on  the  date  of  his  claimed  entry  namely  April  2000/1.  The
         appellant's evidence is that he was born in Zambia on 28 May  1976;
         his father was a National of Mozambique and was awaiting travel  to
         the USA where he had either been recognised as a refugee or was  in
         the process of being so recognised. He and his mother travelled  to
         the USA after his father, he thinks in 1978 when  he  was  2  years
         old. He confirms he had a Green card that he thinks  described  him
         as an "Alien resident". He  has  no  recollection  of  his  parents
         applying for him to become a naturalised US citizen and never  went
         to any citizenship ceremony. He recalls being issued with  a  white
         passport when he was in secondary school in  about  1990;  when  he
         travelled to the UK in 2000 he travelled  on  an  Emergency  Travel
         document which he had obtained at short notice  to  enable  him  to
         travel to Zimbabwe for a funeral. After that he travelled to the UK
         and says he was given 6 months leave to enter as a visitor. He says
         that given his length of absence from the USA, his green card  will
         have expired. His evidence was that he had tried to contact the  US
         Embassy to see if he could get a passport but had


             "... never got anywhere. They make it very hard just to get in
             touch and I have never been able to get an appointment."


      6. He says he contacted the Mozambique High Commission but  they  said
         that given his background they could not issue him with a  passport
         and they could find no trace of him.


      7. The extract from USCIS.gov website, accessed on 22 January 2018, on
         maintaining permanent residence sets out that  permanent  residence
         is lost, inter alia, if an individual  moves  to  another  country,
         intending to live there permanently or remains outside the  US  for
         an extended period  of  time.  The  extract  from  the  website  on
         passport information for non US travel documents,  accessed  on  22
         January 2018 refers to two different types of  US  Travel  document
         book being issued prior to 2003. A Permit to Re-Enter the US had  a
         White cover and a Refugee Travel Document had blue  cover,  lighter
         than the navy covers of US passports. A re-entry  Permit  is  valid
         for two years; a new one  can  be  applied  for  after  expiry  but
         reference is made to remaining outside the US  for  longer  than  a
         year might lead to the loss of permanent resident status.


      8. Travelling on a US issued  travel  document,  it  is  unlikely  the
         appellant would have required entry clearance to enter the  UK.  He
         would have been endorsed entry at port. In those circumstances,  it
         seems highly unlikely that there will be a record of his entry held
         by the UKBA. The respondent did not  submit  that  individuals  who
         enter without entry clearance are  nevertheless  recorded  on  some
         sort of system that would enable a search to be made for entry.  On
         the basis of this evidence  I  am  satisfied,  on  the  balance  of
         probabilities that the appellant is not a US  citizen.  Whether  he
         will be able to regain entry to the US is not a matter upon which I
         am able to reach a conclusion but I do express  the  opinion  that,
         after some 17 or 18 years absence, I  think  it  unlikely  that  he
         would regain his Green Card and thus his re-entry. That is a matter
         I have factored into my decision.


      9. I am not able to reach a conclusion on whether the appellant  is  a
         Zambian citizen or a Mozambique citizen,  in  the  absence  of  any
         evidence in connection with those countries and  their  citizenship
         legislation. Whatever he is, he has  no  personal  recollection  of
         either of those countries, having left when he was aged 2 and lived
         all his life either in the USA or the UK. I have factored this into
         my decision.


     10. The appellant has the following criminal convictions:

|                |Possession Class A (MDMA) |No separate penalty        |

     11. The respondent has not sought to deport the  appellant  because  of
         his criminal convictions. The respondent  states  in  her  decision
         that the appellant does not fall for refusal under the  suitability
         requirements although also noting that he has five convictions  and
         that these are matters that weigh heavily against the appellant  in
         determining whether his removal from the UK is justified. In  fact,
         the appellant had more than five convictions at  the  date  of  the
         decision and since the date of the decision he has  been  convicted
         of three  drugs  offences  for  which  he  received  a  fine.  But,
         nevertheless, the respondent does not reject the application on the
         basis of suitability and did not seek to resile  from  that  before
         me. There was no submission that I should go behind  that  decision
         of the respondent although Mr Bates submitted  I  should  take  his
         convictions into account.
     12. The respondent identifies T1 as an Irish citizen and the other  two
         children as British Citizens. T1 has an Irish passport. T1 and  A's
         mother is settled in the UK, if not a British citizen.


     13. Both T1 and A live in and have lived all their lives in the UK with
         their mother.







    Discussion

     14. In terms of the Immigration Rules, the appellant is not excluded on
         suitability grounds. He is separated from his earlier partners.  He
         does not meet the eligibility criteria for leave  to  remain  as  a
         partner. The general criteria to be met by the  appellant  and  the
         specific criteria to be met for eligibility as a parent are set out
         in Appendix FM GEN.1; E-LTRPT.2.2-2.4  and  3.1-3.2  and  EX1  must
         apply[i]. EN meets the suitability criteria.


     15. He is an overstayer and has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
         with a British Citizen child and a child settled in the UK;  he  is
         in the UK and the two children with  whom  he  has  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship have been living continuously in the UK for
         more than 7 years; their mother is settled in the UK; he is not  in
         a genuine and subsisting relationship with their mother and he does
         not live with their mother; the children  live  with  her.  He  has
         direct staying contact with  the  children  as  agreed  with  their
         mother.


     16. The two children spend their holidays with him. The very fact  that
         they spend such lengthy periods of time with him is  evidence  that
         he takes and is taking an active role in the children's upbringing.
         There is no evidence that such a role will or is  likely  to  cease
         within the foreseeable future.


     17. The two children are at school in the UK.  They  have  never  lived
         anywhere other than the UK.  It  cannot  possibly  be  successfully
         asserted that the best interests of the children are anything other
         than that they remain in the UK living with their mother  and  with
         the extensive staying contact that they currently have  with  their
         father, the appellant. It would be unreasonable and unduly harsh to
         expect the children to leave the UK and it  would  be  unreasonable
         and unduly harsh for them to lose the lengthy  periods  of  contact
         that they have with their father.


     18. The appellant is not the subject of a deportation order. Part 13 of
         the Immigration Rules does not apply.


     19. It is plain that EN meets E.LTRPT.2.2 - 2.4., 3.1-3.2 and  EX.1(a).
         Of course, this appeal is not an appeal against a decision that  he
         does not meet the criteria set out in the Immigration Rules but  is
         an appeal against a decision to refuse his human rights  claim.  EN
         meets the criteria of the  Immigration  Rules.  S117B  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 sets out the considerations  to  be
         taken account of when considering a human rights appeal.  S117C  of
         the 2002 Act does not apply. Mr Bates submits that  I  should  have
         regard to EN's convictions. In considering this submission and  the
         effect on the appeal it is important to bear in mind that EN  meets
         the criteria in the Immigration Rules and, taking  account  of  the
         considerations set out  in  s117B  of  the  2002  Act,  the  public
         interest in his removal from the UK is minimal. The convictions  do
         not over-ride the acceptance by the respondent that  EN  meets  the
         suitability criteria.


     20. In these circumstances, there can be no other finding but  that  EN
         succeeds in his appeal.


     21. Of course, should there be any further convictions  the  respondent
         may  take a different view  on  EN's  suitability  and  deportation
         action may ensue. But for now and on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
         before  me,  the  removal  of  EN  would  be   a   disproportionate
         interference in his family life and that of his two older  children
         and a breach of Article 8.


    Conclusion


    The First-tier Tribunal made an error  of  law  and  I  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal;


    I allow the appeal of EN.
