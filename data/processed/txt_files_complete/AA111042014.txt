For the Appellant:     Ms F Kadic, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Albania.  He is a minor having been  born
    on 4th November 1998.  The Appellant left  Albania  on  14th  September
    2013 and travelled by lorry arriving in the UK on 16th September  2013.
    Thereafter he was put in  contact  with  social  services  and  claimed
    asylum on 15th October 2013.  The Appellant's  application  for  asylum
    was based on a claim that he had a well-founded fear of persecution  in
    Albania on the basis of his involvement in a blood feud and thus on the
    basis of his membership of a particular social group.  That application
    was refused by the Secretary of State on 28th  November  2014.   Within
    that Notice of Refusal it was noted that the Appellant being  currently
    aged under 17ï¿½ and  adequate  reception  arrangements  in  Albania  not
    having been established that he qualified for leave  to  remain  as  an
    unaccompanied asylum seeking child until 3rd May 2016.

 2. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Callender Smith sitting at Taylor  House  on  17th  March
    2015.  In a decision and reasons promulgated  on  7th  April  2015  the
    Appellant's appeal was dismissed on asylum and human rights grounds and
    the Appellant was found not to be in need of humanitarian protection.

 3. On 21st April 2015 Grounds of Appeal were  lodged  on  the  Appellant's
    behalf to the Upper Tribunal.  On 5th May  2015  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Murray granted permission to appeal.  Judge Murray noted
    that the grounds stated that the judge used  too  high  a  standard  of
    proof when considering the minor discrepancies in the evidence and  did
    not  properly  take  into  account  the  Appellant's  young  age   when
    considering his evidence.  Further  although  the  judge  mentions  the
    authority of EH (Albania) [2012] UKUT 348 (IAC) the grounds state  that
    there is no explanation of how it was considered.  He  noted  that  the
    grounds  contend  that  the  judge  appears  to   have   been   seeking
    corroboration which is not necessary in an asylum  claim  and  that  he
    placed undue weight on immaterial matters and  thereafter  went  on  to
    state that Article 8 had not properly been considered.

 4. Judge Murray noted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  referred  to
    paragraph 74 of EH relating to blood feuds and the details set  out  in
    the body of that case.  He further noted that the judge had been  aware
    of the  Appellant's  young  age  and  that  he  had  not  rejected  the
    Appellant's evidence about why he has not tried to find his  family  in
    Albania but he does not agree with what  the  Appellant  has  done  and
    finds it  goes  against  the  Appellant's  credibility.   Judge  Murray
    considered that it was  not  for  the  judge  to  put  himself  in  the
    Appellant's position and decide what the Appellant should have done and
    that the judge may well have used too high a  standard  of  proof  when
    reaching his decision.  With regard to Article 8 he considered that  it
    was not  clear  what,  if  anything,  was  before  the  judge  in  this
    connection and in such circumstances  overall  found  that  there  were
    arguable material errors of law.

 5. On 18th May 2015 the Secretary of State responded  to  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal under Rule 24.  That response opposed  the  Appellant's  appeal.
    The response points out that the Respondent had attempted to verify the
    Appellant's claim and had not been able to do so and further the person
    [MG] who it was claimed had been murdered by his uncle was recorded  as
    having committed suicide.   The  Secretary  of  State  noted  that  the
    Appellant had made no attempt to deal with these matters or to  contact
    his family in Albania and that it was open to  the  judge  to  conclude
    that the Appellant's refusal to engage with the Red Cross and  maintain
    contact by telephone with his family was to prevent any attempt at  the
    Respondent seeking corroboration.  Further the Rule 24  response  notes
    that the Appellant's claim was not believed and the Appellant  provided
    no evidence to deal with material inconsistencies and that it was  open
    to the judge to dismiss the appeal.  Further there was no  evidence  to
    support a consideration of Article 8 which could  be  resolved  in  the
    Appellant's favour.

 6. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The Appellant appears by his  instructed  Counsel
    Ms Kadic.  The Secretary of State appears by her Home Office Presenting
    Officer Mr Avery.

Submissions/Discussion

 7. Ms Kadic relies on the Grounds of Appeal submitting that  the  Tribunal
    has applied an unduly high burden of proof.  She acknowledges  that  at
    paragraph 24 and thereafter the judge has set out the correct  standard
    of proof  but  submits  that  the  standard  imposed  by  the  Tribunal
    particularly with regard to corroborative evidence is  too  high.   She
    contends that no  consideration  has  been  given  to  the  Appellant's
    circumstances/narrative and how difficult it is to obtain evidence from
    Albania.  She submits that the judge did not give  due  weight  to  the
    narrative and that whilst the judge has  acknowledged  the  Appellant's
    tender age (at paragraph  44)  that  the  judge  has  not  treated  his
    evidence as that of a minor.  She states that the Appellant  has  given
    reasons as to why he is having difficulty contacting  his  parents  and
    submits that the reasoning of the judge has been subjective rather than
    objective.  She asked me to find that there is a material error of law,
    to set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and to  remit  the
    matter back to the First-tier for rehearing.

 8. Mr Avery opposes the application.  He points out that the Appellant has
    had the whole of the period that he has  been  in  the  UK  to  produce
    corroborative evidence and none has been produced and  in  making  that
    submission he takes into account  the  Appellant's  tender  years.   He
    submits it is wrong to say the Appellant was not aware of the report of
    the British Embassy as set out in the Notice of Refusal and that it was
    open to the Appellant to have taken steps to obtain  such  evidence  as
    was needed regarding the feud if he had been able to.   He  points  out
    the issue is that the information provided by the British  Embassy  and
    the Appellant's account are irreconcilable.  He  points  out  that  the
    Albanian authority have confirmed that although MG had  died  that  was
    reported as being a suicide and that  the  authorities  had  taken  the
    matter no further.  He emphasises that pointing out that there  was  no
    investigation  for  murder  being  carried  out  by   any   prosecuting
    authorities and  that  this  is  fundamentally  incompatible  with  the
    Appellant's account.  In such circumstances he submits that  the  judge
    has looked fully at the evidence, made findings that he was entitled to
    and that the findings at paragraph 42 to 44 are ones that the judge was
    entitled to reach.

 9. In very brief response Ms Kadic contends that the judge has  failed  at
    paragraph 42 to make findings regarding the blood feud.

The Law

10.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

11. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

12. A proper approach to credibility requires an assessment of the evidence
    and of the general claim.   In  asylum  claims,  relevant  factors  are
    first, the internal consistency of the claim;  secondly,  the  inherent
    plausibility of the claim; and thirdly, the consistency  of  the  claim
    with external factors of the sort typically found in country  guidance.
    I acknowledge that it is theoretically correct that a claimant need  do
    no more than state his claim, but that claim still needs to be examined
    for consistency and inherent plausibility.  Further it is necessary  to
    give due and proper consideration to the Appellant's age.

13. In this appeal the judge has given, albeit scant, consideration to  the
    country guidance given in EH.  He has noted the authority at  paragraph
    33 and has made findings to the effect that there is not any blood feud
    in existence and in reaching those findings he has given due and proper
    consideration to the position relating  to  blood  feuds  generally  in
    Albania as set out at paragraph 74 of EH.

14. The question herein is whether or not the judge has put himself in  the
    position of the Appellant and therefore applied too high a standard  of
    proof or whether the Grounds of  Appeal  posed  on  his  behalf  amount
    effectively to mere disagreement.  This is a judge who has acknowledged
    clearly throughout that he has taken account of  the  Appellant's  age.
    He has heard the evidence.  He has made a finding at paragraph 39  that
    there is almost no objective or independent evidence in support of  the
    Appellant's claim.  He has recited the evidence and has  made  findings
    which he was perfectly entitled to having considered that  evidence  at
    paragraphs 42 to 44 firstly that he is not satisfied about anything the
    Appellant states about the alleged blood feud and secondly the evidence
    that has  been  produced  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  which  is
    reiterated to me by Mr Avery today that the death of MG was  due  to  a
    suicide and not as a result of a blood feud.  I note that there  is  no
    objective evidence whatsoever that was before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    or indeed available now to support the Appellant's contention  that  MG
    was murdered and was a victim of a blood feud.

15. Further the judge has gone on to consider at paragraphs 45 and  46  the
    seeming failure of the Appellant to involve the Red Cross to locate and
    contact his immediate family  in  Albania  and  has  made  findings  at
    paragraph 47  with  regard  to  the  damage  done  to  the  Appellant's
    credibility.  In such circumstances I find this  is  a  judge  who  has
    carried out a full and thorough analysis and I am  not  satisfied  that
    the judge has in any way imposed too high a burden of proof.   In  fact
    the judge has addressed this matter in a careful and considered manner.
     In such circumstances the decision discloses no material error of law.
     Nor does it disclose any material error of law in the manner in  which
    the judge has addressed Article 8, this  being  properly  addressed  at
    paragraph  49  of  the  determination.   In  such   circumstances   the
    Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses no material error  of  law
and is dismissed and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is maintained.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
