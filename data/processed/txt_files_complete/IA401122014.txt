                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Adio  promulgated  25.4.16,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated
    22.9.14, to refuse his application  for  a  derivative  residence  card
    pursuant to regulation 15A of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006,
    as amended.  The Judge heard the appeal on 14.4.16.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.9.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 24.10.16 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons summarised below, I found such  error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Adio to be set aside and  remade  by  dismissing  the
    appeal.

 5. There is a lengthy history to this appeal.  On  13.1.14  the  appellant
    applied for a derivative residence card as the carer of his  mother,  a
    British citizen resident in the UK.  The  appeal  against  the  refusal
    decision of 22 September 2014 came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Howard on to January 2015. The appeal was dismissed, the  Tribunal  was
    not satisfied that the requirements of regulation 15A and 18A were  met
    and not satisfied that the appellants sister was not living in the  UK.
    Permission to appeal was granted in February 2015,  which  came  before
    the Upper Tribunal on 14.9.15. The Upper Tribunal found an error of law
    and set aside the decision, remitting it to be reheard  afresh  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 6. In the First-tier Tribunal decision of 25.4.16, Judge Adio  found  that
    the appellant's sister was not living in the UK and that there had been
    no communication between his mother and his brother, whose  whereabouts
    were unknown. At paragraph 25 the judge stated: "I  am  therefore  left
    with the situation that the appellant  is  the  primary  carer  of  his
    mother and I find that the  quality  of  care  that  the  appellant  is
    providing is such that his mother will be left and vulnerable in  terms
    of her quality of life if the appellant is unable to reside in  the  UK
    do continue to care for her."

 7.  At paragraph 26 judge Adio stated, "On a balance of probability  I  am
    satisfied that the extent of care given by the appellant is  such  that
    if it is taken away from his mother the quality of  her  life  will  be
    affected and deteriorate and suitable  care  cannot  be  obtained  from
    social services in  the  UK  bearing  in  mind  the  closeness  of  the
    relationship between the appellant and his  mother.  I  find  that  the
    appellant  satisfies  the  conditions  for  issuance  of  a  derivative
    residence card."

 8. Although at paragraph 23 the decision states, "I now go on to deal with
    the issue whether the appellant's mother who is a British citizen would
    be unable to reside in the UK or another EEA State if she was  required
    to leave," it is clear that the judge omitted to resolve that issue.  I
    note that at �6 of the error of law decision of the Upper  Tribunal  it
    was found that the previous First-tier Tribunal Judge  failed  to  make
    any finding as to whether or not the appellant's mother would  have  to
    leave the United  Kingdom  if  the  appellant  is  not  issued  with  a
    derivative residence card. This was the crucial issue in the appeal. It
    appears that having identified the relevant issue,  Judge  Adio  became
    distracted by issues of the quality of life of the appellant's  mother.
    Whilst the appellant may well be the primary carer of his mother  under
    regulation 15A(7), having primary  responsibility  for  her  care,  the
    judge overlooked the preceding qualifying requirement under  regulation
    15A(4A)(c), that not only must the appellant be the primary carer of  a
    British citizen residing in the UK, but that the British citizen  would
    be unable to reside in the UK or in another EEA state if the  appellant
    were required to leave.

 9. Whilst the quality of care may be reduced if the appellant is  required
    to leave, that is not the correct test for a derivative right under EEA
    regulations.  The fact that the appellant and the sponsor may prefer to
    continue with their arrangement is also irrelevant, as is made clear in
    MA & SM (Zambrano: EU children outside EU) Iran [2013] UKUT 380,  where
    the Upper Tribunal stated, "the right of residence is a right to reside
    in the territory of the EU. It is not a right to any particular quality
    of life or to any particular standard of living."

10. Further, Judge Adio also erred in finding at �26 that if the  appellant
    were required to leave the UK, suitable care could not be obtained from
    Social Services. This was mere speculation and is inconsistent with the
    case law of Ayinde and Thinjom (Carers - Reg  15A  -  Zambrano)  [2015]
    UKUT 00560 (IAC), in which the Upper Tribunal  found that as a  British
    citizen has the option of going into residential or nursing care, there
    can be no valid claim that they would be unable to remain  in  the  UK.
    The carer has to establish as a fact that the British citizen would  be
    forced to leave the territory of the Union.  The  Upper  Tribunal  also
    held, "A comparison of the British citizen's standard of living of care
    if the appellant remains or departs is material only in the context  of
    whether the British citizen will leave the UK."

11. It is clear that the decision of the first-tier Tribunal was made under
    fundamental errors of law and cannot stand.

12. It follows from the above and the materials and evidence  submitted  in
    the application and the appeal process  that  there  is  absolutely  no
    credible evidence before the Tribunal that the appellant's mother would
    be forced to leave the UK, or unable to reside in another EEA state  if
    the appellant were required to leave the UK.

13.  In the circumstances, the appellant cannot succeed in his  application
    for a derivative residence card, whether or not he is the primary carer
    of his mother. The appeal should have been dismissed in the  first-tier
    Tribunal.

14. Article 8 ECHR issues do not arise in an EEA appeal.

Conclusions:

15. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
