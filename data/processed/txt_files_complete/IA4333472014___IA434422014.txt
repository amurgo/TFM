                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Cooper sitting at Taylor House  on  30  June
    2015) dismissing their appeals against the refusal of leave  to  remain
    as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  on  non-point  scoring  grounds  of
    refusal  under  paragraph  245DD(h)  of  the  Rules,  and  against  the
    Secretary of State's concomitant decisions to remove them from the  UK.
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and we  do
    not  consider  that  the  appellants  require   anonymity   for   these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 2 February 2016 Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  for
    the following reasons:

         1.   At paragraph 36 of the decision the judge has referred to  the
             Appellants on their own best  case  having  only  secured  one
             contract at the date of application.  The  Judge  goes  on  to
             refer at the  conclusion  of  paragraph  36  to  the  position
             whereby at the date of the hearing there had  been  no  future
             potential contracts. At paragraph 22 of the decision the Judge
             reminded himself of the scope of admissible  evidence  in  the
             case.

         2.   It is arguable, given  the  credibility  findings  which  were
             adverse to the Appellants reached by the  Judge,  that  it  is
             unclear to what extent these findings have  been  affected  by
             the taking into account of  the  factor  referred  to  at  the
             conclusion  of  paragraph  36.  It  is   arguable   in   these
             circumstances that an error of law has been made.

         3    It is further  arguable  that  insufficient  weight  has  been
             attached to the actual investment of �50,000 into  a  separate
             legal entity/business in  the  overall  consideration  of  the
             credibility of the appellants and the Rule to be applied.

Relevant Background

 3. The appellants are nationals  of  Pakistan.  They  entered  the  UK  as
    students, and they both obtained leave to remain as Tier  I  post-study
    work migrants. On 31 July 2014 they made a combined application  as  an
    entrepreneurial team  for  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  I  Entrepreneur
    Migrants. They said they intended to operate a  management  consultancy
    business through a company they had set up called Ibas Consulting Ltd.

 4. A significant change to the Rules relating to Tier I entrepreneurs  was
    introduced by HC 943 on 30 January 2013. This was the introduction of a
    genuine entrepreneur test  to  operate  alongside  the  points  scoring
    regime, whereby the applicant needs to score inter alia a minimum of 75
    points under paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix  A  (Attributes).  On  the
    archived version of the  Rules  in  force  at  the  date  of  decision,
    Paragraphs 245DD(h) to (k) provided as follows:

         (h) ...The Secretary of State must be satisfied that:

             (i)  the applicant genuinely;

                  (1)  intends and is able to establish, take over or become
                      a director of one or more businesses in the UK within
                      the next six months, or

                  (2)  has established, taken over or become a  director  of
                      one or more businesses in the  UK  and  continues  to
                      operate that business or businesses; and

             (ii) the applicant  genuinely  intends  to  invest  the  money
                  referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A in  the  business  or
                  businesses referred to in (i);

             (iii)    that the money referred to in Table 4 of  Appendix  A
                  is genuinely available  to the applicant, and will  remain
                  available to him until such time as it  is  spent  by  his
                  business or businesses.

             (iv) that the applicant does not intend to take employment  in
                  the United Kingdom other than under the terms of paragraph
                  245DE.

          i) In making the assessment in (h), the Secretary of  State  will
             assess on the balance of probabilities. The Secretary of State
             may take into account the following factors:

             (i)  the evidence the applicant has submitted;

             (ii) the viability and credibility  of  the  source  of  money
                  referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;

             (iii)    the viability  and  credibility  of  the  applicant's
                  business plans  and  market  research  into  their  chosen
                  business sector;

             (iv)  the  applicant's  previous  educational   and   business
                  experience (or lack thereof);

             (v)  the applicant's immigration history and previous activity
         in the UK;

             (vi) where the applicant has already registered in the  UK  as
                  self-employed or as the director of a  business,  and  the
                  nature of the business requires  mandatory  accreditation,
                  registration and/or insurance, whether that accreditation,
                  registration and/or insurance has been obtained; and

             (vii)    any other relevant information.

         (j)   The  Secretary  of  State  reserves  the  right  to   request
             additional information and evidence to support the  assessment
             in (h), and to refuse the application if  the  information  or
             evidence is not provided.  Any  requested  documents  must  be
             received by the Secretary of State at the address specified in
             the request within 28 working days of the date of the request.

         (k)   If  the  Secretary  of  State  is  not  satisfied  with   the
             genuineness of the application in relation to a points-scoring
             requirement in Appendix A, those points will not be awarded.

 5. At G20 of the application form which they were  required  to  complete,
    the appellants were informed that, following the  introduction  of  the
    genuine entrepreneur test in  January  2013,  it  might  help  if  they
    provided the information "listed below"  with  their  application.  The
    list included "Your business plan". They were asked to note that it was
    not a requirement for them to provide this information,  but  it  might
    help if they did so. The appellants did not  provide  a  business  plan
    with their respective applications.

 6. On 2 October 2014 the  appellants  were  separately  interviewed  about
    their applications, and on 15  October  2014  their  applications  were
    refused. The reasons for the refusal were the  same,  except  that  the
    first appellant, Mr Javed,  was  also  refused  on  a  distinct  ground
    arising  under  Appendix  A.  He  had  not  shown  that  he  had   been
    continuously engaged in business activity since before 11 July 2014 and
    up to the date of application, as the trading  contract  which  he  had
    submitted had been signed by his partner, but  not  by  him.  The  non-
    points scoring reasons for refusal common to both appellants were:

      a) The failure to submit a business plan with the application;

      b) The contract with Bella Pizza shop was not credible;

      c) The failure to provide credible evidence (either in interview or in
         documentary form) of having undertaken any market research;

      d) Their  website  was  very  basic  and  it  contained  spelling  and
         formatting errors;

      e) Their failure at interview to outline the services offered by their
         business, how they had identified potential  investment,  how  they
         had formulated revenue and growth projections, and  what  processes
         they needed to implement in  order  to  establish  and  grow  their
         business;

      f) The failure to demonstrate relevant business experience;

      g) The failure to  use  their  PSW  leave  to  develop  a  consultancy
         business.

 7. Based on the above considerations, the Secretary of State  refused  the
    applications because the appellants had failed to demonstrate that they
    genuinely intended or were able to establish the  business  within  six
    months; or that they  genuinely  intended  to  invest  �50,000  in  the
    proposed business.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The substantive hearing of the appeal was  originally  listed  to  take
    place on 18 May 2015.  It was adjourned at the appellants'  request  as
    they said they did not have at Court a copy of the business plan  which
    they said they had taken to the interview on 2 October  2014,  and  had
    offered to the interviewer for her to  take  into  account.  Designated
    Judge Shaerf made directions for the appellants to file their  business
    plan and for the respondent to confirm whether it had been offered on 2
    October 2014, or to produce a transcript of the interviews.

 9. The substantive hearing took place before Judge Cooper on 30 June 2015.
    The appellants were represented by  Counsel,  and  the  respondent  was
    represented by a Home Office Presenting Officer.

10. At the outset of the hearing, the judge noted that the  respondent  had
    not complied with the direction to confirm that the business  plan  had
    been offered, or to provide a transcript of the interviews to show that
    it had not been offered. There was an interview  template  showing  the
    questions asked, and the responses, but not a  transcript  showing  the
    additional exchange which was said by  the  appellants  to  have  taken
    place.

11. The judge received oral evidence from the appellants on  the  topic  of
    the business plan. The first appellant's evidence was that his  partner
    had taken a three page plan business plan (Plan 1) to the interview  on
    2 October 2014, but the female interviewer had refused to take it.  The
    second appellant's evidence was that he had taken a  21  page  business
    plan (Plan 2) to the interview, not the 3 page plan (Plan 1) which  was
    an earlier draft which he happened to have on his mobile  phone  on  18
    May 2015.  Neither plan had been included in the bundle for the hearing
    on 18 May 2015.

12. In  his  subsequent  decision,  the  judge  gave  detailed  reasons  at
    paragraphs [26]-[34] for finding that neither Plan 1  nor  Plan  2  had
    been offered to the interviewer on 2 October 2014, and that Plan 2  had
    not come into existence by the time of the interview.

13. At paragraph [36] the judge  rejected  Counsel's  submission  that  she
    should take the business plan tendered to the interviewer into account.
    But if she was wrong about that, she  held  that  Plan  1  was  neither
    comprehensive nor credible, and its financial projections  were  wildly
    optimistic.  The appellants anticipated sales of �50,000 in  the  first
    year of trading rising to �120,000 in year three. However, at the  date
    of application, "on their  own  best  case"  the  appellants  had  only
    secured one contract from Bella Pizza worth �750; and they had provided
    evidence of work for EMCOM over a two week period in September 2014  at
    �7.50 per hour; and, by the date of the hearing, "no  future  potential
    contracts".

14. At paragraphs [37] to [41] the judge gave her reasons for finding  that
    the contract with Bella Pizza was not genuine.

15. At paragraph [42] the judge gave  her  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    second appellant's work for EMCOM  was  not  related  to  the  business
    consultancy, but was likely to have related to his previous business.

16. At paragraphs [43] to [53] the judge addressed the other matters relied
    on by the respondent for not accepting that the appellants were genuine
    entrepreneurs, and gave his reasons for  finding  in  the  respondent's
    favour on points (c), (e), (f) and (g) set out at paragraph 6 above.

17. At paragraphs [54] to [61] the judge gave her reasons for finding  that
    the respondent was also justified in rejecting  the  first  appellant's
    application on the distinct ground that he had not produced a  contract
    which he had signed in order to show evidence of trading, although this
    was a mandatory piece of evidence which was stipulated in Appendix A at
    Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv).

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

18. At the hearing before us, Mr Abbas, who did not appear below, developed
    the grounds of appeal advanced in the application  for  permission.  Mr
    Clarke opposed the appeal for the reasons given by him in the  Rule  24
    response which he had settled following the grant of permission to  the
    first appellant.  The core bundle also contains a Rule 24  response  to
    the same effect in respect of the second appellant's appeal.

Discussion

19. Ground 1 is that the appellant has been a  victim  of  unfairness,  and
    that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  not  taking  this  into  account.
    Permission to appeal was not specifically granted on this  ground.  But
    the judge granting permission also did not  specifically  exclude  this
    ground from being argued.

20. The asserted unfairness is  that  the  appellants  were  not  asked  to
    provide a business plan, but it was held against them  in  the  refusal
    decision that they had failed to provide one.

21. We do not consider there is any merit in this ground. At paragraph [23]
    the judge noted the complaint made by the appellants in their evidence,
    and also by Counsel in submissions, that the appellants  had  not  been
    asked to provide a business  plan.  She  observed  that  there  was  no
    obligation on the Secretary of State to make such a request,  referring
    to subparagraph 245DD(j), and she  found  that  the  onus  was  on  the
    appellants to consider what evidence they should submit to persuade her
    that their business was genuine and viable. At paragraph [24] the judge
    set out the contents of G20 of the application form, and she thus  drew
    attention to the fact that the  appellants  had  been  advised  of  the
    desirability of submitting a business plan,  even  though  it  was  not
    mandatory.

22. The judge returned to the issue at paragraphs [62] to  [67]  where  she
    gave her reasons for rejecting  Counsel's  submission  that,  "fairness
    required the Respondent  to  have  requested  documents  before  making
    adverse findings". She held that the appellants  knew  from  the  rules
    what was required. They knew they had to satisfy the Secretary of State
    that they had  a  genuinely  viable  and  credible  business,  and  the
    necessary educational and professional experience to run it.

23. We consider that the judge has given ample and sustainable reasons  for
    rejecting the case that  the  decision  appealed  against  was  not  in
    accordance with the law because it was vitiated by unfairness. Mr Abbas
    did not engage with the judge's reasons in oral argument. He simply re-
    argued the case which had been run below. He sought  to  buttress  this
    case by reference to internal policy guidance which  he  said  directed
    the case worker to consider making a request for further  documents  at
    the same time as asking the applicant to attend an interview. But  this
    does not avail the appellants on the particular facts of these appeals.
    The genuine entrepreneur test had been in force for over a year at  the
    date of application; they had  the  benefit  of  legal  advice  at  all
    material times; and, at  the  very  latest,  they  were  aware  of  the
    desirability of producing and presenting a business plan by the time of
    the interview. For, in addition to noting the contents of  G20  of  the
    application form, the judge found at paragraph [31] that  a  person  by
    the name of Mr Shahid had forwarded Plan  1  by  email  to  the  second
    appellant at 9.55am  on  2  October  2014,  with  the  interview  being
    scheduled to start at 11am.

24. There is no error of law challenge to the judge's finding that  Plan  2
    did not exist at the time of the interview; and that Plan  1,  although
    in existence, was not tendered to the interviewer.

25. Ground 2 is that the judge  wrongly  took  into  account  post-decision
    evidence contrary to section 85A(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 and Ahmed (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT  00365
    (IAC).

26. This error of law challenge ignores the fact that the judge's  findings
    in paragraph [36] are predicated on  the  alternative  hypothesis  that
    Plan 1 was made available to the Secretary of State at the time of  the
    interview. The judge's primary finding of fact was that it had not been
    made available, and therefore it was not admissible in evidence, as the
    Presenting Officer submitted. But in case she was wrong  to  find  that
    Plan 1 had not been put  before  the  Secretary  of  State,  the  judge
    addressed  the  question  of  its  impact  on  the  central  issue   in
    controversy, which was whether the evidence available to the  Secretary
    of State at the date of decision was such  as  justify  her  not  being
    satisfied about  the  genuineness  of  the  application.  As  Mr  Abbas
    acknowledged in oral argument, Counsel for the appellants  ushered  the
    judge down this path.

27. Mr Abbas submits that Counsel was wrong to invite the judge to consider
    the business plan on its merits, and that the judge was wrong to accept
    the invitation. We reject this submission.  We  consider  that  it  was
    entirely legitimate for the Judge to ask herself whether Plan 1,  which
    was the only business plan which could have been tendered at interview,
    actually assisted the appellants in the overall assessment  of  whether
    they were genuine entrepreneurs. It was open to the judge to find  that
    it did not.

28. Her final reason given for reaching this conclusion is that by the date
    of the hearing  there  were  no  further  potential  contracts  in  the
    pipeline. We accept that if there had been new  contracts  between  the
    date of the interview and the date of the hearing, the  Tribunal  would
    not have been permitted to take these  into  account  as  demonstrating
    that the business was in fact credible and viable.  So  the  fact  that
    there have not been any new contracts cannot be relied on to show  that
    the business is not viable. But the  remaining  reasons  given  by  the
    judge  for  finding  that  the  business  plan  is  not   credible   or
    comprehensive are  sustainable  ones.  So  the  error  at  the  end  of
    paragraph [36] is not material, and does not reveal any  overall  error
    of law in the judge's conclusions.

29. The appellants have not been prejudiced by the exercise  undertaken  at
    paragraph [36]. If the exercise had not been undertaken, their  appeals
    would still have failed for the other free-standing  reasons  given  by
    the judge, none of which are the subject of an error of law  challenge.
    We do not consider that there is  any  risk  of  these  findings  being
    contaminated by what the judge said at the end of paragraph [36].

30. Ground 3 is that the judge and the respondent failed to apply paragraph
    245DD(h) correctly, as the paragraph assumes that the applicant has not
    yet invested his funds in the  business,  whereas  the  appellants  had
    already invested �50,000 in the Company which they set up.

31. Ground 3 is  misconceived.  The  evidence  shows  that  each  appellant
    deposited �25,000 into a bank account of the Company  over  which  they
    had complete control as the only two directors of, and shareholders in,
    the Company.  The fact that �50,000 was sitting  in  the  Company  bank
    account did not of itself prove that the appellants genuinely  intended
    to establish the business, or to  invest  this  sum  of  money  in  the
    business, or that this sum of money would  remain  genuinely  available
    until such time as it was  spent  for  the  purpose  of  the  business.
    Depositing money into a company bank account does not give  rise  to  a
    presumption that the applicant is a genuine entrepreneur, nor  does  it
    preclude the Secretary of State from undertaking  an  assessment  under
    paragraph 245DD(h), as Ground 3 implies.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  these  appeals  did  not
contain an error of  law,  and  accordingly  the  decision  stands  and  the
appellants' appeals to the Upper Tribunal are dismissed.


No anonymity direction is made.
