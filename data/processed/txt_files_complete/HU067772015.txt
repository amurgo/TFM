Representation

For the Appellant:     No representative
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This appeal arises from the decision of the respondent, made on 3
   September 2015, to refuse the appellant's application for entry clearance
   under Paragraph EC-P1.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules as the
   partner of a British citizen. The appellant's ensuing appeal was heard by
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Agnew. In a decision promulgated on 22 April
   2016, the judge dismissed the appeal under both the Rules and Article 8
   ECHR. The appellant now appeals that decision.


2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 17 December 1985. On 23
   December 2014 he married a British citizen in Pakistan ("the sponsor").
   The sponsor would like the appellant (her husband) to live permanently
   with her in the UK, and on 7 June 2015 an application under paragraph ECP
   1.1 was made.


3. The respondent refused the application on the basis that the financial
   requirements under Appendix FM had not been met. The Refusal Notice
   states that, from the documents submitted, the sponsor's annual income
   was �14,426.48, which falls short of the required threshold of �18,600 a
   year. The Notice also states that a bank statement for March 2015 was
   omitted and that the statements supplied did not demonstrate salary
   payments between February and May 2015.


4. In addition, the respondent found that the financial requirements could
   not be met by relying on the sponsor's savings, as bank statements for
   the full six months prior to the application had not been submitted.
   Specifically, it was stated that a statement covering January 2015 had
   been omitted.


5. The application was also rejected on the basis that there were not
   exceptional circumstances to warrant a grant of entry clearance under
   Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration Rules.


6. The appellant's appeal was decided on the papers by Judge Agnew. The
   judge dismissed the appeal under Appendix FM on the basis that the
   appellant had failed to provide the required evidence under Appendix FM-
   SE to demonstrate that for six months preceding the application his
   sponsor had the required savings. The judge also found there had been a
   failure to comply with the requirement specified in Appendix FM-SE to
   declare the source of the savings.


7. The grounds of appeal argue that the appellant submitted with his
   application savings account statements covering the requisite period and
   that the sponsor explained the source of the funds (which were a gift
   from her parents).


8. The appellant was not represented at the error of law hearing and I
   heard submissions from his sponsor (with the assistance of family
   members). In sum, the appellant's argument was that the required
   documents had been submitted and the judge was in error to find they had
   not been. Mr Whitwell was hindered by not having the complete file and he
   was unable to comment on the dates documents in the Tribunal's file were
   submitted.

Error of Law

9. At paragraph 14 of the decision, the judge found that the appellant had
   only submitted bank statements to demonstrate the sponsor's savings up to
   2 February 2015 even though he was required to submit statements covering
   the period between December 2014 and May 2015.  However, in the Notice of
   Refusal the respondent stated that the appellant had submitted statements
   covering the period 23 February to May 2015 and the only issue raised in
   respect of omitted savings account statements was the absence of a
   statement for January 2015.


10. The judge decided the appeal on the papers and it may be that the file
   before him did not contain the savings account statements covering
   February to May 2015. However, having regard to the respondent's
   acceptance in the Refusal Notice that savings account statements were
   submitted that covered this period and my review of the Tribunal's file
   which indicates such statements were submitted, I find that the judge has
   made a material error of law by deciding the case on the basis that the
   aforementioned bank statements were not submitted when the respondent
   accepted (and the evidence indicates) that they were.


Remade decision

11. Having identified a material error of law in the decision, I will now
   proceed to remake the appeal.


12. In order to succeed under the Immigration Rules, the appellant must
   meet the evidential requirements specified in Appendix FM-SE as well as
   the substantive conditions in Appendix FM. It was common ground that the
   sponsor's income alone was insufficient to satisfy the financial
   requirements under Appendix FM. It will therefore be necessary to
   consider both her income and her savings.


13. Under paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE, in order to evidence the sponsor's
   gross income, the appellant was required to submit payslips covering a
   period of 6 months prior to the date of application, a letter from the
   sponsor's employer confirming her employment and salary, and bank
   statements corresponding to the same period as the payslips.


14. The appellant submitted payslips covering the requisite period along
   with the required letter from the employer (stating the sponsor's annual
   salary was �16,702.40). He also submitted his sponsor's P60 for the year
   ending April 2015 (which shows a gross income of �15,770.90). However, he
   only submitted bank statements for the sponsor's NatWest current account
   ending ***532 (which is the account into which her salary was paid) up to
   19 February 2015. Statements for the period between February and May
   2015, which he was required to submit, were omitted.


15. In respect of the sponsor's savings, pursuant to paragraph 11 of
   Appendix FM-SE, the appellant was required to submit bank statements
   showing the level of cash relied upon for six months prior to the date of
   the application and to provide a declaration by the sponsor as to the
   source of the savings.


16. The appellant submitted statements from an account of the sponsor
   (NatWest account ending ***744) which showed savings in excess of �36,000
   for the six month period leading up to the application. I am satisfied,
   having reviewed the Tribunal file, that the bank statements submitted
   with the application covered the full six month period and it is not the
   case, as stated in the Refusal Notice, that a statement for one of the
   months was omitted. A declaration was made by the sponsor as to the
   source of the savings, which were said to primarily comprise of a gift
   from her parents.


17. The evidence that was before the respondent unambiguously demonstrates
   that the substantive requirements of E-ECP.3.1.(b) of Appendix FM were
   satisfied. These require the appellant to have specified savings of
   �16,000 and additional savings of an amount equivalent to 2.5 times the
   amount which is the difference between the gross annual income and
   �18,600. Given the sponsor's savings of �36,000 and annual income of
   around �16,000, the threshold is comfortably met.


18. However, it is not sufficient to meet the substantive conditions of
   Appendix FM. The Rules in Appendix FM-SE, which specify the type of
   evidence that must be submitted to substantiate the claim, must also be
   met.


19. I am satisfied that the appellant complied in full with the
   requirements of Appendix FM-SE in respect of her savings. As explained
   above, he provided the required savings account bank statements and
   declaration from his sponsor.


20. With regard to evidencing the sponsor's income, the appellant provided
   most of the required information but failed to include statements
   covering a four month period (February - May 2015). This was the only
   omission.


21. The appellant submits (and I accept) that these statements were omitted
   by mistake as the sponsor inadvertently included statements for an ISA
   account instead of her current account for the period between February
   and May 2015.  The appellant argues that if the mistake had been drawn to
   his attention by the respondent it could easily have been rectified.


22. Paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE ("Paragraph D") sets out circumstances in
   which the respondent will apply evidential flexibility. It provides that
   the decision maker may contact an applicant in certain circumstances such
   as if a sequence of documents (like bank statements) have been submitted
   and some of the documents in the sequence have been omitted.  Paragraph D
   also stipulates that decision makers will not request documents where
   they do not anticipate that addressing the omission will lead to a grant
   because the application will be refused for other reasons.


23. This is a case where it was appropriate for the respondent to apply the
   evidential flexibility provided for in Paragraph D. The appellant had
   submitted a sequence of documents to satisfy the requirement under
   paragraph 2(c) of Appendix FM-SE (provision of six months of bank
   statements showing salary being deposited) but some of the bank
   statements in the sequence were omitted. Having seen the sponsor's
   payslips, P60 and employer's letter it would have been clear to the
   decision maker that the omitted bank statements were likely to show her
   salary being paid into the account and that the omission was probably
   inadvertent. As the missing bank statements were the only deficiency in
   the application, addressing the omission would have led to a grant of
   entry clearance as there was no other reason for the application to be
   refused.


24. In the Notice of Refusal the respondent stated that paragraph D had
   been considered but it was not deemed appropriate to exercise evidential
   flexibility as the appeal would be refused for other grounds. As I have
   explained, there were, in fact, no other grounds to refuse the
   application. Accordingly, the respondent's reason for not applying
   Paragraph D was misconceived.


25. The failure to exercise discretion under Paragraph D renders the
   decision to refuse the appellant's application for entry clearance as a
   partner under Appendix FM not in accordance with the law.

Decision

26. The decision of the First Tier Tribunal contains a material error of
   law and is set aside.


27. I remake the said decision by allowing the appellant's appeal to the
   limited extent that the decision of the respondent was not in accordance
   with the law and the appellant's application remains outstanding.
