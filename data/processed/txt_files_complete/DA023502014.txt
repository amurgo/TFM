Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr T Bobb. Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       On 30 June 2014 I granted permission to appeal to the  Secretary
      of State in respect of the determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      Cockrill of 14 May 2014 allowing the appellant's  deportation  appeal.
      The matter now  comes  before  me  for  hearing.  For  convenience,  I
      continue to refer to the Secretary of State as the respondent  and  to
      Mr Smith as the appellant.

   2.       The appellant is a Jamaican national born on 10  November  1969.
      He first entered the UK in November or December 1999 as a visitor.  He
      claims to have then varied his leave in order to study until  20  June
      2000. He then overstayed until early 2003 when he  left  the  country.
      On 15 May 2003 he sought to return  but  his  passport  was  found  to
      contain a counterfeit ILR endorsement. He was also in possession of  a
      counterfeit letter from the Home Office notifying him of  a  grant  of
      indefinite leave to remain. As a result he was refused leave to enter.
      The appellant claimed he knew nothing of the falsity of the documents,
      that he had met someone whom he thought was a Home Office employee who
      had offered to process his  application  for  him,  and  that  he  had
      travelled back and forth between the  UK  and  Jamaica  several  times
      using that passport without any problems until 2003.

   3.       On 12 April 2004 he married Lorna Cummings in Jamaica. Her  date
      of birth is 29 July 1962. They had met previously in the  UK  and  she
      travelled to Jamaica in July 2003, March  2004  and  January  2005  to
      spend time with him and  to  marry  him.  Although  her  parents  were
      originally from Jamaica, she herself was born and brought  up  in  the
      UK.

   4.       On 19 May 2005 the appellant's application for  entry  clearance
      as  a  spouse  was  refused.  The  ECO  was  not  satisfied  that  the
      relationship was genuine or subsisting or that the appellant could  be
      maintained without recourse to public funds. An appeal was lodged  but
      was dismissed by a judge on  4  February  2006  following  a  hearing.
      Challenges  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the   High   Court   proved
      unsuccessful.

   5.       On 5 September 2006 the appellant made a further application for
      entry clearance but this was also refused on  28  February  2007.  His
      appeal was dismissed on 14 November  2007  and  a  High  Court  review
      refused on 4 December 2007.

   6.       On 8 December 2008 the appellant was granted a visa to join  his
      wife on compassionate grounds following her stroke earlier that  year.
      He entered the UK on 9 January 2009 with leave to  enter  until  March
      2011. He then sought ILR which was granted on 19 December 2011.

   7.       On 28 November 2011 the appellant was convicted at Croydon Crown
      Court of two counts  of  being  knowingly  concerned  in  fraudulently
      evading prohibition/restriction on the importation of controlled drugs
      (Class B) on 19 August 2010 and 9  September  2010  and  sentenced  to
      three and four years in  prison  to  be  served  concurrently.  He  is
      currently on licence until 27 November 2015.

   8.       On 26 January 2012 the Secretary of State notified the appellant
      of his liability to deportation under section 32(5) of the UK  Borders
      Act 2007 and sought information from him as to why he  should  not  be
      deported. There is written confirmation that the papers were  received
      by the appellant on 30 January 2012 but he refused to sign  for  them.
      Nevertheless, a completed copy of the questionnaire dated 14  February
      2012 is to be found at Annex U. The appellant maintained that his wife
      worked as a probation officer but had heart problems, that he was  the
      only one supporting her and that he had no family in  his  country  of
      origin.  There is no reference to  Mrs  Smith's  diagnosis  of  Cardio
      Vascular Dementia some two years  earlier.  Representations  from  his
      solicitors were also made on 6 August  2012  (Annex  V).  Whilst  they
      refer to the appellant being unable to return to Pakistan  (V2),  they
      also argue that return to Jamaica would interfere with his private and
      family life.

   9.       An undated NOMS report (requested on 3  October  2013)  assesses
      the appellant as posing a low risk of serious harm to others and a low
      risk of reoffending (S6) but  notes  his  behaviour  as  reckless  and
      questions whether he was ever involved of such activity in the past or
      whether it was a single incident of such offence (S4). The  author  of
      the report also expresses concern that the appellant had expressed his
      wish to travel to other countries after  his  release  to  pursue  his
      musical career. The appellant was told that he was  not  permitted  to
      travel whilst on licence and that his request for such a privilege was
      not supported (S8). The appellant was also questioned on how he  could
      care for his wife if he was travelling for his  work;  no  explanation
      was offered. The appellant maintained this was the only way  he  could
      earn money (S9).

  10.       On 11 November 2013  a  deportation  order  was  signed  by  the
      Secretary of State. This was served on the appellant  on  15  November
      2011. In the accompanying notice of decision, the Secretary  of  State
      considered  the  appellant's   immigration   history,   his   criminal
      convictions, the public interest and the Article 8  factors  that  had
      been put forward.

  11.       The appellant challenged the decision and his appeal was allowed
      by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cockrill who found that  the  appellant's
      wife's condition was an exceptional factor which  took  priority  over
      the public interest.

Appeal hearing before the Upper Tribunal

  12.       Ms Holmes relied on the Secretary of State's grounds. These  can
      be summarised as under:
      1)    The  appellant's  circumstances  do  not  establish  exceptional
      circumstances that would outweigh  the  pressing  public  interest  in
      deportation and the judge misdirected himself in allowing  the  appeal
      on this basis because
      i)    The severity of the appellant's wife's condition is unclear from
      the determination; there are imprecise and contradictory  findings  on
      her ability to drive, to care for herself and the extent of  care  she
      requires from others;
      ii)   Mrs Smith has access to professional care and has  an  extensive
      network of family members who have provided care and could continue to
      do so. Her desire to be looked after by the appellant does not  amount
      to an exceptional circumstance;
      iii)  It has not been established that it is unjustifiably  harsh  for
      the appellant and his wife to make a choice about whether  they  would
      live in Jamaica or would continue a relationship via modern  means  of
      communication.
      2)    The judge did not  adequately  deal  with  the  public  interest
      element in that
      i)    The severity  of  the  offence  and  the  legitimate  aims  that
      deportation engages were not afforded the appropriate weight;
      ii)    The judge did not consider the circumstances  of  the  offences
      and why the appellant offended;
      iii)  The correct approach to the public interest was not followed;
      iv)   The assessment of the public interest was fundamentally flawed.

  13.       Ms Holmes expanded on the grounds. She  referred  to  paragraphs
      118 and 74 and argued that the appellant's wife's driving ability  was
      unclear and that the appellant only had a provisional driving licence.
      She submitted that  the  findings  on  the  Mrs  Smith's  health  were
      unfocused and did not clearly spell out the nature  of  her  problems.
      The clinical needs mentioned in paragraph 129 were  unidentified.  Mrs
      Smith's evidence failed to suggest any cognitive impairment. She could
      dress  and  shower  herself  and  she  was  able  to  care   for   her
      grandchildren. The judge should have made clear and full findings  and
      he failed to do so. Whilst of course Mrs  Smith  would  prefer  to  be
      cared for by her husband, there were others who could look after  her.
      The judge failed to take account of the fact that  the  appellant  had
      relatives in Jamaica. Although he found that Mrs Smith's  needs  could
      all be met by the appellant in the UK, he failed to  explain  why  the
      same care would not be provided by  the  appellant  in  Jamaica.  With
      regard to the public  interest  issue,  the  judge  had  not  properly
      grappled with the SS Nigeria principles (at paragraphs  51-54).  There
      was no acknowledgment of the weight accorded  by  legislation  to  the
      policy of deporting foreign criminals. That warranted far more serious
      consideration that was found in the determination.  The  circumstances
      of the offence had not been considered  either.  Fresh  findings  were
      necessary  and  the  matter  should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal.

  14.       Mr Bobb replied. He submitted that the  determination  was  well
      balanced and that the judge had set out the reasons why he  considered
      the case to be exceptional. The judge had  a  great  deal  of  medical
      evidence with respect to the appellant's wife. She  had  suffered  two
      strokes, had dementia and problems with mobility and memory. She would
      not have mobility aids available to her in Jamaica. The judge accepted
      her evidence that she could not and would  not  go  to  Jamaica.  That
      meant there would be a nullification of family  life  as  her  illness
      progressed. Mrs Smith's daughter had her own life and could  not  give
      her full attention to her mother. Nor could Mrs Smith's siblings.  The
      findings were open to the judge. They were not perverse and  so  could
      not be dislodged. The right test was set out in the determination. The
      judge found that the appeal succeeded only because of Mrs Smith's  ill
      health. There were insurmountable difficulties in the continuation  of
      life  outside  the  UK.  The  question  was  whether   it   would   be
      unjustifiably harsh to deport the appellant in circumstances where  it
      was unreasonable to expect his wife to accompany him.  The  judge  had
      had regard to the public interest. Despite the strong public  interest
      in deporting foreign criminals, there were cases where  this  was  not
      justified.  The  appellant's  case  was   one   such   example.    The
      respondent's grounds were no more than a disagreement with the judge's
      findings and the decision should be upheld.

  15.       Mr Holmes responded. She submitted that the grounds were  not  a
      disagreement. The  judge's  findings  on  the  sponsor's  health  were
      unclear and  the  decision  lacked  a  consideration  for  the  public
      interest in the wider sense.

  16.       At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  determination
      which I now give.

Findings and Reasons

  17.        I  have  had  careful  regard  to  the  submissions  made,  the
      determination of the First-tier Tribunal and the evidence to  which  I
      was referred. My decision has not been taken lightly  but  only  after
      consideration of all the evidence and I  have  given  thought  to  the
      submission forcefully made by Mr Bobb on the appellant's  behalf  that
      the respondent's grounds amount to no more than  a  disagreement  with
      the findings and decision of the judge.  After  much  deliberation,  I
      reach the conclusion that the judge's finding  that  Mrs  Smith's  ill
      health was an "exceptional" factor which displaced the public interest
      in deportation was not adequately reasoned and did not properly engage
      with the pressing  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of  foreign
      criminals.

  18.       Whilst it was argued for the appellant that there was nothing in
      the nature of the offence for the judge to have had  regard  to  other
      than the conviction itself, the respondent was  entitled  to  maintain
      that the circumstances surrounding the offences  were  a  matter  that
      should have been considered. The appellant continues to  maintain  his
      innocence  in  the  involvement  of  the  importation  of  drugs;  his
      explanation is that he unwittingly became involved whilst  doing  some
      friends some favours. As can be seen from the sentencing remarks,  the
      appellant was found to have been part of  the  organisation  behind  a
      commercial operation to import two significant shipments  of  cannabis
      valued at �100,000, controlling the couriers  involved,  fetching  and
      carrying them, providing them with tickets  and  hotel  accommodation.
      This led the judge to deal with him more harshly  than  the  couriers,
      having noted that he had no mitigation to put forward, no plea and  no
      remorse (O2-3).  This raises issues over what the appellant  has  done
      to take responsibility for his behaviour  and  address  his  offending
      behaviour (it may be seen from the NOMS assessment  that  nothing  has
      been done and from the OASys report that no  responsibility  has  been
      taken and that he does not recognise the impact  and  consequences  of
      offending on the community) and entirely conflicts with the  claim  in
      his grounds of appeal that  he  is  remorseful  for  his  actions  (at
      paragraph 9). These are matters which should have  factored  into  the
      judge's assessment.

  19.       Also relevant is the appellant's previous conduct with regard to
      the deception practised with regard to a false Home Office letter  and
      vignette. The appellant's claim that he did not know  the  endorsement
      or the letter were forgeries, that he had met a man whilst socialising
      who purportedly worked for the Home Office and offered  to  process  a
      student renewal application for him which turned into a grant of  ILR,
      apparently for no charge (A1, B1; respondent's bundle) is contradicted
      by his entry clearance interview on 19 May 2005 where he  is  recorded
      as stating to the ECO that "a guy at the  school  got  me  the  forged
      thing" (D).

  20.        Given  the  appellant's  conduct,  his  criminality   and   the
      substantial weight to be given to public policy,  the  Article  8  put
      forward for the appellant had to be very compelling indeed in order to
      succeed. It is plain from the determination that the only factor which
      the judge found "exceptional" was Mrs Smith's ill health. He failed to
      consider whether the  appellant  and  his  wife  should  be  separated
      despite the latter's condition based on the  public  interest  factors
      and given the focus on Mrs Smith, there is merit is  the  respondent's
      submissions that his findings in that respect needed to be clearer.  I
      accept that there was medical evidence before  the  judge  albeit  the
      majority of it was some two years out of date.  It  is  not  disputed,
      however, that Mrs Smith suffered two strokes and  was  diagnosed  with
      cardio vascular dementia in 2010 or thereabouts. What  the  respondent
      finds lacking in the  determination  are  clear  and  non  conflicting
      findings on, for example, the extent of help Mrs Smith  requires,  the
      activities she is able to undertake on her  own,  the  extent  of  her
      memory problems and the care available to her from others.  It has  to
      be said that the 'findings' made on these matters  could  be  clearer.
      There is also some concern expressed over the  appellant's  intentions
      which could usefully be addressed. The Secretary of  State's  decision
      letter cites the  concern  of  the  Probation  Officer  and  questions
      whether the appellant had used his  wife's  ill  health  in  order  to
      obtain his release when his intention was to travel Europe  to  pursue
      his music career.  As the entire  appeal  rests  on  Mrs  Smith's  ill
      health, the respondent is entitled to  expect  a  determination  which
      addresses the issue in a more focused and thorough way. Whilst I  have
      sympathy  with  Mrs  Smith's  situation,  there  needs  to  be  better
      engagement with why that single factor overrides all  the  other  very
      compelling public interest factors.

  21.       For  these  reasons,  I  find  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
      complaint is more than simply a disagreement with the outcome  of  the
      appeal. Both parties agreed that if an error of law were  found,  then
      the matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing
      afresh and that is what I have therefore decided to do.

Decision

  22.       The First-tier Tribunal made errors of  law  which  require  the
      decision to be set aside. The matter shall be heard by a panel of  the
      First-tier Tribunal which shall be tasked with making  fresh  findings
      and re-making the decision.

Anonymity

  23.       The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity  order  and  I
      see no reason to make one.
