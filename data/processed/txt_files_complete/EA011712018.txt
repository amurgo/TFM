Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity should have been granted at an earlier stage  of  the  proceedings
because the case involves child welfare issues. For  this  reason,  we  find
that it is appropriate to make an order. Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or
court directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of
these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member
of his family. This direction applies both  to  the  appellant  and  to  the
respondent.

Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr R. A Jafar instructed by Kothala & Co.
For the respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica whose date and method  of  entry
    is unknown. On 24 October 2002 he applied for  asylum.  The  claim  was
    refused on 19 December 2002. He remained in the UK without leave  until
    18 April 2007 when he applied for a residence card recognising a  right
    of residence as the family member of an EEA national.  The  application
    was initially refused, but after a successful  appeal,  he  was  issued
    with a residence card on 10  January  2011.  On  21  December  2015  he
    applied for a permanent residence card. The application was refused  in
    a decision dated 14 June 2016. There is no evidence  to  indicate  that
    the appellant appealed the decision.

2.    The appellant has a son from his relationship with the  EEA  national.
    We were told that he is a Swedish national who was born in the UK on 25
    June 2010 (nine years old). Although there is no direct evidence of his
    nationality it does not appear to be disputed. The appellant donated  a
    kidney to his EEA partner  in  early  2014  but  says  that  she  still
    requires regular treatment. Their relationship ended  in  2015  but  he
    continues to have regular contact with his son. In particular, he looks
    after him when his mother attends hospital for dialysis.

3.    The appellant established a relationship with a British citizen.  They
    have a daughter who is a British citizen born  on  03  June  2017  (two
    years old). Although the appellant is no longer in a relationship  with
    her mother, he says that he continues to have regular contact with  his
    daughter.

4.    The appellant appealed the  respondent's  decision  dated  16  January
    2018 to administratively  remove  him  with  reference  to  regulations
    23(6)(a)  and  32(2)  of  The  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations 2016") on  the  ground  that  he
    ceased to have a right to reside in the UK under EU law. The respondent
    was not  satisfied  that  he  had  acquired  a  right  of  a  permanent
    residence. The notice of decision stated that the appellant had a right
    to appeal and went on to provide the following information:

         "The appeal must be made on one or more of the following grounds:

           .  That  the  decision   is   unlawful   because   it   racially
             discriminates against you;

           . That the decision is unlawful because it is incompatible  with
             your rights under the European Convention on Human Rights;

           . That the decision breaches rights which you  have  as  an  EEA
             National or member of  such  a  person's  family  under  Union
             Treaties relating to entry or residence in the UK;

           . That the decision is otherwise not in accordance with the law;

           . That your removal from the United Kingdom as a result  of  the
             decision would:

                o breach the United Kingdom's  obligations  under  the  1951
                  Refugee Convention;

                o be  incompatible  with  your  rights  under  the  European
                  Convention on Human Rights.

         You should not appeal on grounds which do not  apply  to  you.  You
         must also give arguments any supporting  evidence  which  justifies
         your grounds."

5.     Pausing  there,  it  becomes  apparent   from   our   discussion   on
    jurisdiction below, that the notice of decision was  out  of  date  and
    misleading in  relation  to  the  information  provided  regarding  the
    grounds of appeal that might be available to the appellant. Having been
    told that one available ground of appeal  might  be  that  his  removal
    would be incompatible with his rights under  the  European  Convention,
    the appellant proceeded to appeal  the  decision  citing  human  rights
    grounds. He raised family life issues with his children in the sections
    of the appeal form entitled "Human Rights Decision", "EEA Decision" and
    "New Matters".

6.    A note from the respondent's GCID records printed  on  11  March  2019
    indicates  that  the  appellant  was  interviewed  after   the   police
    encountered him on 15 January 2018. In that interview he  notified  the
    respondent that he had two children in the UK. The GCID entry  from  13
    November 2018 shows that the appeal was adjourned on 06 September  2018
    for the Home Office Presenting Officer to take instructions and for the
    Secretary of  State  to  consider  further  evidence  relating  to  the
    appellant's family life in the UK. At  the  hearing  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Mr Melvin confirmed that he could find no evidence to suggest
    that a further decision was made in relation to the family life  issues
    raised by the appellant.

7.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll ("the judge") dismissed  the  appeal
    in  a  decision  promulgated  on  25  March  2019.  Inaccurately,   she
    identified the decision that was the  subject  of  the  appeal  as  the
    earlier decision to refuse a permanent residence card [1] although  she
    noted that a subsequent decision was made to remove the appellant on 16
    January 2018 [7]. In relation to the  jurisdiction  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to consider the human rights issues the judge said: "By virtue
    of removal directions being in  force,  the  appellant  relies  upon  a
    breach of Article 8 in the context of  his  family  and  private  life,
    principally his relationship with his two children..." [9].  The  judge
    noted that limited evidence had been produced from the mothers  of  the
    two children, but after  having  heard  evidence  from  the  appellant,
    concluded:

         "15.     The limited evidence before me falls  very  far  short  of
         demonstrating that the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         parental relationship with his two children in the UK.  Insofar  as
         he sees those children, his role appears to be that of a babysitter
         and I have referred above to the discrepancies between the  written
         and the oral evidence as to the frequency of  contact  between  the
         appellant and the children. The evidence from [the oldest  child's]
         school is now very out of date (June 2018) and not supported by any
         evidence from his mother.

         16.      I was referred by the appellant's  Counsel  to  the  Upper
         Tribunal decision in JG (Section 117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK)
         Turkey [2019] UKUT 00072. The factual matrix in  that  decision  is
         entirely different from that in the appeal before  me.  In  JG  the
         Upper Tribunal considered the position of a nuclear family. In this
         case, the appellant is no longer in a relationship with the mothers
         of either of his two  children  and  there  is,  quite  simply,  no
         expectation that either of the children  should  leave  the  United
         Kingdom."

8.    Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal on the following grounds:

      i) It was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal failed to have  regard
         to the nature of a relationship between a parent and a minor child,
         where family life is normally presumed, in circumstances  where  it
         appeared to be accepted that the appellant had  contact  with  both
         children. It was arguable that the judge  erred  in  characterising
         the appellant's  role  as  a  "babysitter"  rather  than  having  a
         parental relationship with his children.

     ii) It was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal's finding relating  to
         JG (Section 117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey  [2019]  UKUT
         00072 was contrary to the findings made in that  case.  The  First-
         tier Tribunal was required to  conduct  a  hypothetical  assessment
         whether or not the children would in fact be expected to leave  the
         UK.

    iii) Although it was not pleaded in the grounds of appeal to  the  Upper
         Tribunal, Judge Jackson noted that consideration might need  to  be
         given to  whether  the  First-tier  tribunal  had  jurisdiction  to
         consider human rights grounds in  light  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
         decision in Amirteymour v SSHD  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  353  given  that
         removal directions had not been set and there was  no  evidence  to
         suggest that the appellant was issued with a notice  under  section
         120 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  ("NIAA
         2002"). After the hearing, the Upper Tribunal also made  directions
         to the parties requesting further submissions on the scope  of  the
         appeal in light of the recent decision  in  Munday  (EEA  decision:
         grounds of appeal) [2019] UKUT 00091.



LEGAL FRAMEWORK

Rights of European citizens

9.    Article 20 of the Treaty on the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union
    (TFEU) (ex Article 17 TEC) sets out rights arising from citizenship  of
    the Union.

         "1.      Citizenship of the  Union  is  hereby  established.  Every
             person holding the nationality of a Member State  shall  be  a
             citizen of the  Union.  Citizenship  of  the  Union  shall  be
             additional to and not replace national citizenship.

         2. Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights and be  subject  to
             the duties provided for in  the  Treaties.  They  shall  have,
             inter alia:

             (a) the right to move and reside freely within  the  territory
                  of the Member States;

             ...

         These rights shall be exercised in accordance with  the  conditions
         and limits defined by the Treaties  and  by  the  measures  adopted
         thereunder."

10.   Article 21 (ex Article 18 TEC) states:

         "1.      Every citizen of the Union shall have the  right  to  move
         and reside freely  within  the  territory  of  the  Member  States,
         subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties
         and by the measures adopted to give them effect. ..."

11.   In Baumbast and R (Free Movement of  Persons)  [2002]  EUECJ  C-413/99
    the Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  (CJEU)  outlined  the
    underlying importance of the rights arising from  European  citizenship
    even if the citizen was not exercising rights of  free  movement  as  a
    worker.

         "94.     The answer to the first part of the  third  question  must
             therefore be that a citizen  of  the  European  Union  who  no
             longer enjoys a right of residence as a migrant worker in  the
             host Member State can, as a citizen of the Union, enjoy  there
             a right of residence by direct application  of  Article  18(1)
             EC. The exercise of that right is subject to  the  limitations
             and  conditions  referred  to  in  that  provision,  but   the
             competent  authorities  and,  where  necessary,  the  national
             courts must ensure that those limitations and  conditions  are
             applied in compliance with the general principles of Community
             law and, in particular, the principle of proportionality."

12.   The principle was  summarised  by  Mrs  Justice  Lang  in  R  (on  the
    application of Gureckis) v SSHD [2018] EWHC 3298 (Admin).

         "89.     Freedom of movement for workers was one  of  the  founding
         principles of the EU, now found in Article  45  TFEU.  Its  primary
         purpose was to promote the economic objective of a  common  market,
         together with the  freedom  of  movement  of  goods,  services  and
         capital. This was reflected in the earlier cases relied upon by  Mr
         Eadie QC, such Case 53/81 DC Levin v Secretary of State for Justice
         [1982]  2  CMLR  454,  at  [17].  However,  since  the  Treaty   of
         Maastricht, which introduced the  notion  of  EU  citizenship,  the
         concept of freedom of  movement  has  broadened  into  a  right  to
         freedom of movement  and  residence  for  EU  citizens,  and  their
         families, without a requirement to be economically active, provided
         that they do not seek social assistance from the host Member State.
         Articles 20 and 21 of TFEU grant EU citizens "the right to move and
         reside freely within the territory of the Member  States",  subject
         to the limitations and conditions laid down  in  the  Treaties  and
         Directives. These principles are reflected in  Recitals  (1),  (2),
         (3), (5) and (11) to the Directive. See also Case C-413/99 Baumbast
         v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] 3  CMLR  23  at
         [81] - [84]."

13.   Article 7 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the  European  Union
    protects the right to respect for 'private and family life'. Article 51
    of the Charter makes clear that the provisions of the Charter apply  in
    the following circumstances:

         "The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the  institutions,
         bodies, offices and agencies of the Union with due regard  for  the
         principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only  when  they
         are implementing  Union  law.  They  shall  therefore  respect  the
         rights, observe the principles and promote the application  thereof
         in accordance with  their  respective  powers  and  respecting  the
         limits of the powers of  the  Union  as  conferred  on  it  in  the
         Treaties."



Rights of European citizen children

14.   In Ruiz Zambrano v Office national de l'emploi [2011]  EUECJ  Case  C-
    34/09  the  CJEU  considered  the  circumstances  of  European  citizen
    children living in their country of nationality (Belgium) whose parents
    were third country  nationals.  The  court  noted  that  the  Citizens'
    Directive did not apply to the children because they had not  exercised
    rights of free movement. However, the court observed  that  Article  20
    TFEU conferred the status of citizen of the Union on every national  of
    a Member State. As the court had stated on several occasions, including
    in Zhu and Chen, citizenship  of  the  Union  is  intended  to  be  the
    fundamental  status  of  nationals  of  the  Member  States.  In  those
    circumstances, Article 20 TFEU precluded national  measures  that  have
    the effect of depriving citizens of the Union of the genuine  enjoyment
    of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of their  status  as
    citizens of the  Union.  Article  20  precluded  a  Member  State  from
    refusing a residence  permit  to  third  country  national  parents  in
    circumstances where the refusal would lead to  a  situation  where  the
    children would have to accompany their parents. The children  would  be
    unable to exercise the substance of the rights  conferred  on  them  by
    virtue of their status as citizens of the Union.

15.   In Alfreso Rend�n Mar�n v Administraci�n del Estado  [2016]  EUECJ  C-
    165/14 the CJEU considered a case involving a  Colombian  national  who
    was the sole carer for  two  European  citizen  children  (Spanish  and
    Polish citizens). The applicant was refused a residence card on  public
    policy grounds. The  CJEU  emphasised  that,  as  Union  citizens,  the
    children had the right to move and reside freely within  the  territory
    of the European Union and that any limitation on that right fell within
    the scope of EU law. In so far as Mr Mar�n's situation fell within  the
    scope of EU law, the assessment of his situation must take  account  of
    the right to respect for private and  family  life,  as  laid  down  in
    Article 7 of the Charter, an article which must be read in  conjunction
    with the obligation to take  into  consideration  the  children's  best
    interests, recognised in Article 24(2) of the Charter.

16.   In Chavez Vilchez v Raadvanbestuur van der Sociale Verzekeringsbank  &
    others [2018] QB 103 the CJEU considered a number  of  cases  involving
    the proposed removal of third country national  parents  who  were  the
    primary carers of European citizen children, where the  other  European
    citizen parent was either absent  or  played  a  minimal  role  in  the
    child's life. The court considered what weight should be given  to  the
    best interests of the child and concluded:

         "1.      Article 20 TFEU must be interpreted as  meaning  that  for
             the purposes of assessing whether a child who is a citizen  of
             the European Union would be compelled to leave  the  territory
             of the European Union as a whole and thereby deprived  of  the
             genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred  on
             him by that article  if  the  child's  third-country  national
             parent were refused a right of residence in the  Member  State
             concerned, the fact that the other  parent,  who  is  a  Union
             citizen,  is  actually  able  and  willing  to   assume   sole
             responsibility for the primary day-to-day care of the child is
             a relevant factor, but it is not in itself a sufficient ground
             for a conclusion that there is not, between the  third-country
             national  parent  and  the  child,  such  a  relationship   of
             dependency that the child would indeed be  so  compelled  were
             there to be such a refusal of a right of  residence.  Such  an
             assessment must take into account, in the  best  interests  of
             the child concerned, all the specific circumstances, including
             the age of the  child,  the  child's  physical  and  emotional
             development, the extent of his  emotional  ties  both  to  the
             Union citizen parent and to the third-country national parent,
             and the risks which separation from the  latter  might  entail
             for the child's equilibrium.

         2. Article 20 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding  a  Member
             State from providing  that  the  right  of  residence  in  its
             territory of a third-country national, who is a  parent  of  a
             minor child that is a national of that Member State and who is
             responsible for the primary day-to-day care of that child,  is
             subject to the requirement  that  the  third-country  national
             must provide evidence to prove that a refusal of  a  right  of
             residence to the third-country national parent  would  deprive
             the child of the genuine enjoyment of  the  substance  of  the
             rights pertaining to the child's status as a Union citizen, by
             obliging the child to leave  the  territory  of  the  European
             Union, as a whole. It is however for the competent authorities
             of the Member State concerned to undertake, on  the  basis  of
             the evidence  provided  by  the  third-country  national,  the
             necessary enquiries in order to be  able  to  assess,  in  the
             light of all the specific  circumstances,  whether  a  refusal
             would have such consequences."

17.   The Court of Appeal in Patel v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  2028  considered
    the effect of Chavez-Vilchez and concluded:

          "25.    It seems clear therefore that the underlying principle  in
             Zambrano is undisturbed by Chavez-Vilchez, albeit that in  the
             case of a child dependent on one parent who is a third country
             national with no right of residence, the State must  ensure  a
             careful  process  of  enquiry.  However,   the   third-country
             national bears the evidential burden of establishing that  the
             child citizen will, in practice, be compelled to leave the EU,
             unless rights of residence  are  granted  to  the  (principal)
             carer parent."

18.   The Home Office Policy  Guidance  "Free  Movement  Rights:  Derivative
    Rights of Residence" (Version 5.0 - 02 May  2019)  says  the  following
    about the best interests of children in the context of  derived  rights
    of residence.

         "The duty in section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration
         Act 2009 to have regard to the need to safeguard  and  promote  the
         welfare of children who are in the UK means that  consideration  of
         the  child's  best  interests  is  a   primary   consideration   in
         immigration cases.

         You must carefully consider all of  the  information  and  evidence
         provided concerning the best interests of a child in  the  UK  when
         assessing whether a relevant child would be unable to remain, or to
         continue to be educated, in the UK, if the applicant  left  the  UK
         for an indefinite period."



DECISION AND REASONS

Jurisdiction

19.   We made further directions and invited submissions from  both  parties
    on the issue of jurisdiction in light of the  decision  in  Munday.  In
    response to directions the respondent asserted that  Munday  should  be
    followed and that the scope of the appeal did not include consideration
    of human rights issues under Article 8 of the European Convention.  The
    appellant made general submissions asserting that the  Tribunal  should
    have regard to human  rights  issues  without  tackling  the  technical
    changes to the statutory appeal  framework  highlighted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Munday  or  the  wider  changes  to  the  appeal  framework
    introduced by the Immigration Act 2014 ("IA 2014").

20.   Some background may assist in understanding the  decision  in  Munday.
    The earlier decision of the Court of Appeal in Amirteymour  involved  a
    decision to refuse to issue a  residence  card  under  The  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations  2006")
    recognising a derived right of residence. The case was similar in  that
    the EEA national child could remain in the care of his  mother  in  the
    UK. No notice was issued under  section  120  NIAA  2002  requesting  a
    statement of additional grounds. The decision gave rise to a  right  of
    appeal against  the  EEA  decision  under  regulation  26  of  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006. At the relevant time paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of the
    EEA Regulations provided that the grounds contained  in  section  84(1)
    NIAA 2002 (except (a) and (f)) had effect  in  relation  to  an  appeal
    brought under the regulations. The grounds of appeal  available  in  an
    appeal brought  under  the  EEA  Regulations  2006  therefore  included
    sections 84(1)(c) and (g), which allowed for an appeal against  an  EEA
    decision to be brought on the ground that the decision, or  removal  in
    consequence of the decision, was unlawful under section 6 of the  Human
    Rights Act 1998 ("HRA 1998") i.e. a breach of the European Convention.

21.   However, the Court of Appeal concluded that there  was  a  fundamental
    difference between an appeal brought against  an  'EEA  decision'  made
    under the EEA  Regulations  2006  and  an  appeal  brought  against  an
    'immigration decision' under section 82 NIAA 2002. The cross  reference
    from paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of  the  EEA  Regulations  2006  to  the
    grounds of appeal contained in section 84(1) NIAA 2002 was intended  to
    give effect to human rights considerations  only  in  so  far  as  they
    related to the EEA decision under appeal. It did not  give  rise  to  a
    broader jurisdiction to consider "a  general  case"  under  Article  8,
    which would normally come under the ambit of an immigration decision.

22.   If the Secretary of State only made a decision in relation to a  right
    asserted under EU law, and did not  made  an  immigration  decision  in
    relation to a human rights claim, the only way in which  the  statutory
    appeals provisions, as they  then  stood,  provided  for  human  rights
    issues to be considered by the Tribunal in an  appeal  against  an  EEA
    decision was:

          i) If the EEA decision was to remove the applicant in which  case
             the appeal against the EEA  decision  directly  engaged  human
             rights issues; or

         ii) Wider human rights  issues  outside  the  context  of  an  EEA
             decision could only be raised if  a  statement  of  additional
             grounds under section 120 NIAA 2002  had  been  completed.  In
             such circumstances section  85(2),  as  it  was  then  worded,
             allowed the Tribunal to consider any matter that was raised in
             the statement which constituted a ground of appeal of the kind
             listed in section 84(1).

23.   The decision in Amirteymour predated the major  changes  made  to  the
    broader appeals provisions contained in Part 5  NIAA  2002  by  the  IA
    2014. It also predated the introduction of paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 of
    the EEA Regulations 2016. In Munday the Upper  Tribunal  explained  the
    effect of those changes in so far as they related to the  scope  of  an
    appeal brought under the EEA Regulations 2016. The two main changes  to
    the legal framework were:

          i) Paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 did not cross  reference  an  appeal
             brought under the EEA  Regulations  2016  to  the  grounds  of
             appeal contained in section 84 NIAA 2002; and

         (ii)     The grounds of appeal  under  section  84  could  only  be
             relied upon  in  appeals  against  the  specified  immigration
             decisions outlined in section 82 e.g. immigration decisions to
             refuse protection or human rights claims.

24.   The Tribunal concluded that the effect of these  changes  was  that  a
    person could  no  longer  rely  on  the  ground  that  the  removal  in
    consequence of an EEA decision made  under  the  EEA  Regulations  2016
    would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human  Rights  Act  1998.  The
    amended grounds of appeal under section 84(1)  are  only  available  in
    appeals against decisions to refuse protection and human rights  claims
    and do not apply to EEA  decisions.  The  wording  of  paragraph  1  of
    Schedule 2 of the EEA Regulations 2016 does not maintain  the  previous
    bridge between the human rights grounds of appeal in section 84 and  an
    appeal against an EEA decision under the regulations. However,  section
    85(2) still gave the Tribunal scope to consider any  matters  contained
    in a statement made under section 120 if they constituted a  ground  of
    appeal under section 84.

25.   In light of these changes the Upper Tribunal in Munday concluded  that
    there is no longer a provision permitting an appellant to  raise  human
    rights grounds in an appeal against an EEA decision  unless  a  section
    120 notice has been considered or an immigration decision to  refuse  a
    human rights claim has been made [81].

26.   Turning to the facts of this case,  the  respondent's  interview  with
    the appellant clearly raised  human  rights  issues  that  engaged  the
    operation of Article 8 of the European Convention. The  respondent  was
    aware that the appellant had two children in the  UK  when  considering
    whether to make a removal decision. However, the respondent  failed  to
    consider the interests of the children  in  accordance  with  her  duty
    under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009
    ("BCIA 2009"). Nor did she consider whether the decision to remove  the
    appellant might engage issues relating to the appellant's  family  life
    with his children  under  Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  in
    accordance with her duty under section  6  of  the  HRA  1998.  In  the
    circumstances it would have been appropriate to issue  a  notice  under
    section 120 asking the appellant to return a  statement  of  additional
    grounds before the decision was made.

27.   In response to directions, the respondent confirmed that there  is  no
    record of a section 120 notice being issued. The only  decision  before
    the First-tier Tribunal was a decision to  remove  the  appellant  with
    reference to regulations 23(6)(a) and  32(2)  of  the  EEA  Regulations
    2016. The structure of the new appeals system no longer  permits  human
    rights grounds under section 84 NIAA 2002 to be  raised  in  an  appeal
    against a removal decision under the EEA Regulations 2016. No statement
    of additional grounds was made by the appellant under section 120  that
    would enlarge the scope of the appeal with reference to section  85(2).
    No decision to refuse a human rights claim was  made  that  would  give
    rise to an appeal under section 82.

28.   It follows from the above analysis that the sole permitted  ground  of
    appeal in this case was that  the  decision  breached  the  appellant's
    rights under the EU Treaties in respect of his entry to or residence in
    the United Kingdom. It was not open to  the  appellant  to  argue  that
    removal in consequence of the decision would be unlawful under  section
    6 of the  HRA  1998  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention.



Error of law

29.   We are satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal  decision  involved  the
    making of errors of law and  must  be  set  aside.  The  appellant  has
    contact with both children. Like many parents who  are  separated,  his
    children do not live with him and he does not have daily  contact.  The
    fact that he provides less day to day care for the children than  their
    mothers, who are the primary carers, does not diminish the fact that he
    has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  the  children.
    It was not within a range of reasonable responses to the  evidence  for
    the judge to describe such contact as "babysitting". In any event,  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge determined the appeal on an  incorrect  legal
    basis She made no findings in respect of  the  sole  ground  of  appeal
    under EU law.



Remaking

Best interests of the children

30.   The appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with
    two children in the UK. The first is a Swedish citizen;  the  second  a
    British citizen. Although the appellant is not the primary carer, it is
    in the interests of the children to continue  their  family  life  with
    their father. His son's mother has  a  serious  medical  condition  and
    still requires regular dialysis. The  appellant's  role  in  his  son's
    life, and the care he provides when his mother is receiving  treatment,
    is even more important in this  context.  The  children  would  not  be
    forced to leave the UK if the appellant was removed. It is likely  that
    both children would remain in the care of their respective mothers.  It
    would place his son in  a  precarious  situation  during  his  mother's
    treatment and/or at times when her  health  is  poor.  The  appellant's
    removal from the UK would separate the children from their father on  a
    long-term basis. We conclude that the best interests  of  the  children
    point clearly towards them being brought up by both parents in the  UK.



Rights under the EU Treaties

31.   The appellant  does  not  have  a  derived  right  of  residence  with
    reference to Zambrano principles because  the  children  would  not  be
    forced to leave the area of EU if the appellant is removed. However, he
    can rely on the broader rights his son has under Article 20  TFEU.  His
    son's rights as a European citizen  are  engaged,  which  must  include
    consideration of  the  best  interests  of  the  child  (Article  24(2)
    Charter) and his right to private and family life (Article 7  Charter):
    see Rend�n Mar�n. The appellant has a  genuine  and  subsisting  family
    life with his son. His removal would lead to long term separation  from
    the child, which would not be in his son's best interests, particularly
    given his mother's health problems. For these reasons, we conclude that
    the decision to remove the appellant would not be  proportionate  under
    EU law. The appellant derives a right of residence under EU  law  based
    on his family life with an EEA national child.

Human Rights

32.   Although we have found that the appeal is confined to EU law  grounds,
    we indicated at the hearing that, even if this was an appeal that could
    be brought on human rights  grounds  with  reference  to  the  European
    Convention,  we  would  conclude  that  removal  would  amount   to   a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's right to family life
    under Article 8 of the European Convention. This finding is not binding
    upon the Secretary of State, but given  the  confusion  caused  by  the
    respondent's failure to consider obvious human rights issues raised  in
    interview, and the misleading nature of the notice of  decision,  which
    suggested that human rights grounds could be raised in this appeal,  it
    is appropriate to express our view.

33.   Section 117B(6) NIAA 2002 is not  specifically  tailored  to  European
    citizen children. Both children meet the definition  of  a  'qualifying
    child'. The appellant's son, because he has been continuously  resident
    in the UK for a period of seven years, and his daughter, because she is
    a British citizen. If this was a  human  rights  appeal,  we  would  be
    satisfied that the appellant has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with both children. The 'real  world'  situation  is  that
    both children would remain in the UK with their mothers and  would  not
    be  expected  to  leave  the  UK.  However,  the  consequence  of   the
    appellant's removal would be the long-term separation of  the  children
    from their father. For the purpose of the hypothetical assessment under
    section 117B(6), in so far as it is said to be compliant with Article 8
    of the European Convention, we conclude that it would  be  unreasonable
    to expect the children to leave the UK.

34.   The decision breaches the appellant's rights under the EU Treaties  in
    respect of entry to or residence in the United Kingdom.
