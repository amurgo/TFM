Respondent  Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of  Pakistan.  The  appellant  entered  the
    United Kingdom on May 14, 2007 as a visitor and on September  14,  2007
    he submitted an application for leave to remain  but  that  application
    was rejected on September 28, 2007. He made a  further  application  of
    October 22, 2007 and this was granted on November 9, 2007  and  he  was
    given a short period of leave until February 9, 2008. An application to
    extend that leave was refused on March 5, 2008 and on July 16, 2009 and
    August 10, 2010 he was served with form IS151A as an overstayer.

 2. On August 12, 2010 he requested a reconsideration of the March 5,  2008
    decision but this was rejected and he thereafter submitted  a  judicial
    review application. By agreement that  application  was  withdrawn  and
    following reconsideration he was granted leave to remain as  a  visitor
    on November 8, 2010 until February 8, 2011.

 3. His applications for leave to remain outside of the Rules  on  February
    5, 2011 and January 28, 2013  were  both  refused  on  March  2011  and
    December 2013.

 4. On April 8, 2014 he submitted an application outside  the  Rules  under
    article 8 and this was refused on June 26,  2014  and  directions  were
    given to his removal under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum act
    1999.

 5. On July 16, 2014 the appellant appealed under section  82  (1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (hereinafter  referred  to
    as the "2002 Act").

 6. The matter came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Williams  on
    October 13, 2014 and in a decision promulgated on November 28, 2014 the
    Tribunal upheld the refusal and dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 7. The appellant applied for permission to appeal  on  December  11,  2014
    submitting the Tribunal had erred. Permission to appeal was refused  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mailer on January 26,  2015  but  when
    those grounds were renewed to the Upper Tribunal Deputy Upper  Tribunal
    Judge McGinty he granted permission finding it is arguable the Tribunal
    had erred in its approach to  section  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  and  had
    thereafter approached its article 8 consideration incorrectly.

 8. No Rule 24 response was filed by the respondent  and  when  the  matter
    came before me on the above date the parties were  represented  as  set
    out above.

 9. No anonymity direction is required.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

10. Mr McVeety accepted the  Tribunal  had  approached  its  assessment  of
    section EX.1 incorrectly  in  light  of  the  decision  of  R  (on  the
    application of Chen) v SSHD (Appendix FM-Chikwamba-temporary separation-
    proportionality)  IJR  [2015]  UKUT  00189  (IAC).   He  accepted   the
    Tribunal's approach to "temporary separation" was incorrect because  at
    paragraph [10] of its determination the Tribunal proceeded on the basis
    that there are no insurmountable obstacles when parties are required to
    return to the appellant's country for a limited  period  only.   Whilst
    initially approaching this matter on the basis that that  decision  may
    not  be  material  Mr  McVeety  conceded,  having  heard  Mr  Karnick's
    submissions, that there was a material error both in  the  approach  to
    Section EX.1 and section 117B of the  2002  Act  because  the  decision
    under the Immigration Rules was flawed.

11. In light of this concession I raised with Mr Karnick whether he  wanted
    this case retained in the Upper Tribunal but having taken  instructions
    he requested that the Tribunal remit the matter back to the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a hearing on the basis that the  whole  determination  was
    flawed and the appellant was entitled to a full right of appeal.

12. I considered Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement.

13. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

         "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
         Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
         Tribunal finds that the making of the decision  concerned  involved
         the making of an error on a point of law, the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         set aside the decision and, if it does so, must  either  remit  the
         case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  or
         proceed (in accordance with relevant Practice  Directions)  to  re-
         make the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).

         The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
         make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½

          a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

          b) the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."

14. In light of the Practice  Direction  whilst  I  had  some  concerns  in
    remitting this matter back to  the  first  Tier  Tribunal  due  to  the
    inherent delays existing in the jurisdiction  at  the  present  time  I
    reluctantly accepted those submissions.

15. It goes without saying that once that date has been fixed the appellant
    should serve on both the tribunal and the respondent and updated bundle
    of evidence that is to be relied on.

    DECISION

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set aside the decision.

17. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.
