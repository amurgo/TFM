For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the  appellant.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and  a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on [  ]  1988.   He
    first arrived in the United Kingdom  on  25  January  2011  with  entry
    clearance as a Tier 4 Student  valid  until  30  April  2013.   Further
    applications for leave were refused in 2013 and 2015.  On 2 April 2017,
    the appellant was  encountered  and  served  with  a  removal  decision
    (RED.0004) and detained.

 3. On 6 April 2017, the appellant claimed asylum.  He claimed that he  had
    been falsely accused of being gay by his brother-in-law as a result  of
    his refusal to marry his  brother-in-law's  sister.   He  claimed  that
    warrants for his arrest had been issued and there was a fatwah.

 4. On 7 June 2017, the Secretary of State refused the  appellant's  claims
    for asylum, humanitarian protection and on human rights  grounds  under
    the ECHR.

 5. The appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Housego
    dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.   Whilst  he  accepted
    that the appellant's brother-in-law was angry about the  appellant  not
    marrying his sister, he  rejected  the  remainder  of  the  appellant's
    account and that he would be, as a consequence, at risk  on  return  to
    Pakistan.  In addition, the judge found that the appellant would obtain
    effective protection from  the  Pakistan  state  and  could  internally
    relocate.

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
    permission was granted by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Keane)  on  25
    July 2017.

 7. On 7 August 2017, the Secretary of State filed a Rule 24 notice seeking
    to uphold the judge's decision.

The Appellant's Case

 8. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Olphert relied on three grounds.

 9. First, he submitted that the proceedings were unfair as the  judge  had
    refused to adjourn the hearing in order that the appellant could obtain
    new legal representatives; his previous representatives  having  ceased
    to act for him on 23 June 2017 shortly before the appeal hearing  on  3
    July 2017.

10. Secondly, the judge was wrong in law not to apply the  approach  in  HJ
    (Iran) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 31 in determining whether the  appellant  had
    established a well-founded fear of persecution on  the  basis  that  he
    would be perceived to be gay.

11. Thirdly, the judge erred in law in applying out of date  guidance  from
    the Home Office in finding that there would be effective protection and
    internal relocation was possible.

Discussion

12. The principal ground relates to the fairness of the proceedings  before
    the judge.

13. The position put forward at the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  by  the
    appellant, who was unrepresented at the hearing, was that his  previous
    solicitors (Prestige Solicitors) had stopped acting for him on 23 June
    2017 because he  was  unable  to  pay  �2,000  for  a  barrister.   The
    appellant was in detention and had approached  the  welfare  department
    and had booked an appointment with a new  firm  of  solicitors  (Duncan
    Lewis) for 5 July 2017.  The appellant sought an adjournment  in  order
    to obtain legal advice, which he said would be available on  legal  aid
    from Duncan Lewis, and pointed  out  to  the  judge  that  he  had  not
    prepared a witness statement and, although two witnesses  had  attended
    the hearing, there were no witness statements in relation to them.

14. The judge dealt in some detail with the appellant's application for  an
    adjournment at paras 19-23 of his determination as follows:

         "19. The appellant applied for an adjournment.  He  said  that  his
             solicitor had made  a  lame  excuse  and  let  him  down  last
             Thursday, saying  that  he  needed  more  money.   He  had  an
             appointment with a new solicitor.  He requested an adjournment
             to be able to be represented.   He had  2  witnesses  who  had
             attended today.  He had an appointment with a solicitor for 05
             July  2017.   The  solicitor  had  been  Prestige   Solicitors
             Manchester who said they needed time to prepare the case.   He
             now had an appointment booked with Duncan Lewis.  I asked  for
             the appellant's comments on a letter contained in the Tribunal
             file, dated 23 June 2017, stating that they  had  received  no
             further instructions from the appellant and so were unable  to
             proceed with representing him.  The appellant  said  this  was
             not the case.  They said they wanted more money.  Duncan Lewis
             would deal with the matter on legal aid.  Prestige  Solicitors
             had let him down and refused to come without more money.  This
             was �2000 to pay for a barrister.  He would not  have  to  pay
             this if he used Duncan Lewis.

         20.  The Home Office Presenting Officer opposed  this  application.
             The appellant had ample time to prepare.  There was nothing to
             say that  Duncan  Lewis  had  accepted  instruction  from  the
             appellant.  The appellant was able to give  his  evidence  and
             his witnesses were already in  attendance.  Cross  examination
             would be brief.  One had  only  to  look  at  the  immigration
             history.  The appellant had come in 2008  and  claimed  asylum
             only after being detained.  This was a stalling tactic.

         21.  I enquired of the appellant whether he had told  Duncan  Lewis
             of the hearing today.  He had not.  He had been to the welfare
             department and booked an appointment, which  was  on  05  July
             2017.

         22.  I declined to adjourn the  hearing.   The  appellant  had  his
             witnesses present.  There was nothing from Duncan Lewis to say
             that there were instructed.  There was no complex law in  this
             case, for the Home Office case was about  credibility.   There
             was a public interest in getting appeals such  as  this  heard
             swiftly.

         23.  The appellant said that  he  needed  more  time  and  had  not
             prepared a witness statement and although he had witnesses  he
             was not able to proceed.  I indicated that I had  decided  the
             hearing would proceed."

15. Mr Olphert relied on the fact that the appellant was in  detention  and
    had had difficulties dealing with his representatives.  He had been let
    down  at  the  last  moment  by  Prestige  Solicitors  and  he  had  an
    appointment fixed for two days after the hearing.   His  case  had  not
    been properly prepared but this was not a case where the appellant  was
    'sitting on his hands' and  it  was  unfair  in  the  circumstances  to
    proceed.

16. Mr Richards, who represented the Secretary of State submitted that  the
    proceedings were not unfair.  Mr Richards submitted that the judge  had
    conflicting accounts as to why the appellant was no longer  represented
    by Prestige Solicitors.  There was no evidence that  Duncan  Lewis  had
    been instructed other than that an  appointment  had  been  fixed  with
    them.  Mr Richards relied upon para 24  and  25  of  the  determination
    where, he submitted, the judge had been scrupulously  fair  in  reading
    through the interview and ensuring that the  appellant  understood  the
    proceedings.

17. The First-tier Tribunal Procedure Rule (the Tribunal Procedure  (First-
    tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules  2014   (SI
    2014/2604)) provide in the case management powers in  rule  4  at  rule
    4(3)(h) that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  may  "adjourn  or  postpone  a
    hearing".  Those case management powers are subject to  the  overriding
    objective set out in rule 2 to deal with a case "fairly and justly".

18. It has been recognised both in relation to the present 2014  Rules  and
    the previous Rules applicable  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    legality of the exercise of discretion not to adjourn a hearing must be
    measured  by  the  requirements  of   "fairness",   rather   than   the
    reasonableness or rationality of the decision not to adjourn (see, e.g.
    Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC) (McCloskey J)).
     There is no "inalienable right to representation"  (see  AK  (Iran)  v
    SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 941 at [25]).  Each case must necessarily be fact-
    sensitive having regard to all the circumstances, including the conduct
    of the appellant and the issue raised in the appeal.

19. Here, the evidence before the judge was at least  consistent  with  the
    appellant  having  been  "dropped"  by  his  previous   representatives
    (Prestige Solicitors) because he was unable to put  them  in  necessary
    funds to pay for a barrister.   The  letter  from  Prestige  Solicitors
    dated 23 June 2017 addressed to the Tribunal  stated  that:  "we  write
    further to receiving  no  further  instructions  from  our  client  and
    therefore are unable to proceed with representing the  above  mentioned
    individual."  That letter is  not  inconsistent  with  the  appellant's
    claim that Prestige Solicitors declined to  represent  him  because  he
    could not provide the funds to pay for a barrister.  Indeed, the 'legal
    speak' that they  had  received  "no  further  instructions"  from  the
    appellant is consistent with the appellant's explanation given  to  the
    judge.

20. In addition, the appellant was in detention.  That necessarily impacted
    upon his ability to instruct lawyers and to prepare his own appeal.

21. Further, the material  before  the  judge  did  not  suggest  that  the
    appellant had been dilatory or, as the HOPO submitted before the Judge,
    had sought an adjournment as a "stalling tactic".   He  had  sought  to
    contact new potential representatives (Duncan Lewis) after his previous
    solicitors withdrew on 23 June 2017 and had arranged an appointment for
    two days after the hearing.

22. The issues in the appeal were not legally complex but  the  appellant's
    credibility was in issue and it is clear from  the  judge's  Record  of
    Proceedings that he was subject to sustained cross-examination  by  the
    HOPO.  He was undoubtedly disadvantaged because  no  witness  statement
    had  been  prepared  for  him  and,  as  appears   from   the   judge's
    determination, there were no witness statements for the  two  witnesses
    who spoke on his behalf.  The interview notes  were  not,  in  form  or
    substance, a wholly adequate substitute for a  witness  statement  from
    the appellant.  Although, at para 24 the judge took the interview notes
    as representing the appellant's witness statement, even  if  the  notes
    were correct and the appellant  did  not  wish  to  amend  them,  their
    fullness  and  form  fell  short  of  what  might  be  expected  of   a
    professionally prepared witness statement.  There was,  of  course,  no
    possible substitute for a witness statement in relation  to  the  other
    two witnesses.

23. There had been no previous  adjournment  of  the  appeal.   Indeed  the
    appeal was heard less than one month after the claim was refused  on  7
    June 2017.

24. The appellant, in  my  judgment,  found  himself  unexpectedly  without
    representation at the hearing.  In AK  (Iran),  Sedley  LJ  (with  whom
    Waller and Dyson LJJ agreed) said at [30]: "... it must be very  rarely
    that an Immigration Judge can legitimately decide  that  representation
    and advice could not possibly improve an appellant's  case."     It  is
    apparent to me that professional representation  would  have  been,  at
    least, of some benefit to him.  He had  at  least  the  possibility  of
    obtaining legal representation in the near future.

25. In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that  it  was  unfair
    for the judge to proceed to hear  the  appeal,  rather  than  grant  an
    adjournment, which would in all likelihood have been  of  a  relatively
    moderate  length,  in  order  for  the  appellant   to   obtain   legal
    representation to present his case in its best light.

26. Having reached that conclusion, the  only  possible  disposal  of  this
    appeal is to set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision and to  remit
    it to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing  before  a  different
    judge.

27. It is not necessary, therefore, to address in any detail the other  two
    grounds relied upon by the appellant as  they  are  immaterial  to  the
    disposal of the appeal.  However, I would note that it does appear that
    the judge applied the  out-of-date  Country  Information  and  Guidance
    Policy at para 58 (which was against the appellant's case), rather than
    the up-to-date policy guidance set out at para 10  of  the  appellant's
    grounds (which was in favour of the appellant's  case)  in  respect  of
    sufficiency of protection.   The  remaining  ground,  relying  upon  HJ
    (Iran) has no merit given  the  judge's  adverse  credibility  finding,
    which is not challenged in the grounds, that he did  not  believe  that
    the appellant's brother-in-law had falsely accused him  of  being  gay.
    The appellant's claim, therefore, to fear persecution  as  someone  who
    would be perceived as gay simply could not succeed.

Decision

28. For the reasons I have given the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    involved the making of an error of law and that decision is set  aside.



29.  Having  regard  to  para  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's   Practice
    statements, the appellant has not had a fair hearing and is entitled to
    a de novo hearing before the First-tier Tribunal before a  judge  other
    than Judge Housego.  The appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
    on that basis.



                                                                      Signed
