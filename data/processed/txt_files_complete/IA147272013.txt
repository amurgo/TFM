For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was  made  by  the  respondent
    although for the purposes of this determination I  will  refer  to  the
    parties as they were described before the First Tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 20th April 1980  and  she
    appeals against the respondent's decision to refuse to vary  her  leave
    and extend her leave to remain as a partner of a British citizen.   The
    appellant entered the UK on 2nd February 2011 with entry clearance as a
    Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant that  was  valid  until  15th  October
    2012.  She studied towards a masters degree in  business  economics  at
    London Metropolitan University and met her husband  David  Waijhaka  in
    October 2011.  He is a British citizen.  She  subsequently  married  on
    8th November 2012.

 3. The reasons  for  refusal  letter  did  not  dispute  the  genuine  and
    subsisting nature of the relationship.  The reasons for refusal  letter
    refused the appellant's application for limited leave to  remain  as  a
    partner further to paragraph E-LTRP.4.1 of Appendix  FM  on  the  basis
    that she had failed to provide a valid English  language  qualification
    and it also  appeared  that  the  application  was  refused  under  the
    financial requirements further to E-LTRP.3.1.  It was acknowledged that
    her partner had lived in the UK all his life and was in  employment  in
    the UK but the appellant  had  failed  to  show  that  there  would  be
    "insurmountable obstacles" to them  continuing  their  relationship  in
    Nigeria.  The appellant did not  meet  the  private  life  requirements
    contained in paragraph 276ADE.  Because she failed to produce  evidence
    to show she met the financial requirements the appellant could not show
    that she met all of the eligibility requirements E-LTRP.1.2-4.2.   This
    is a requirement of R-LTRP.1.1(c).  (Indeed Judge Canavan  recorded  at
    [8] that it was conceded that  at  the  date  of  the  application  the
    appellant's husband was not earning the required  income  to  meet  the
    threshold contained in paragraph E-LTRP3.1).

 4. Further to paragraph R-LTRP.1.1(d) it is possible for an application to
    be considered only if the appellant meets the relationship requirements
    and the immigration status requirements further to E-LTRP.2.1.  EX.1(b)
    applies where a person is in a genuine subsisting relationship  with  a
    partner who is settled in the UK and where  there  are  "insurmountable
    obstacles" to family life with that partner.

 5. First-tier Tribunal determination  Judge  Canavan  in  a  determination
    dated 12th February 2014 found that at paragraph 22

         "Whilst the appellant's husband is a British citizen who has been a
         resident in the UK for a long period of time  I  find  that,  apart
         from those two facts, there are very few other  circumstances  that
         would indicate that he would face any real difficulties if  he  did
         have to relocate to Nigeria with his wife.  Whilst he may not  wish
         to relocate I find that there is insufficient evidence before me to
         show that there would in fact be any 'insurmountable obstacles'  to
         him doing so for the purposes of EX.1 of Appendix FM."

 6. Judge Canavan cited Sanade & Others  (British  Children  -  Zambrano  -
    Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048 and she also quoted Mahmood  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2001] INLR 1 which stated that  a  state
    does not have a general obligation to respect the choice  of  residence
    of a married couple.

 7. However, Judge Canavan proceeded to allow the appeal  under  Article  8
    stating that the Tribunal had made clear that judges were  still  bound
    by their duties under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998  and  that
    there was still a freestanding  human  rights  assessment  outside  the
    Immigration Rules arising from statutory requirements MF (Article  8  -
    new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393.

 8. She stated "although I have found  that  there  are  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to the  couple  continuing  their  family  life  together  in
    Nigeria within the meaning of paragraph EX.1 the test is still quite  a
    high one".

 9. The judge then proceeded to apply  the  questions  posed  in  Razgar  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 349.

10. She took into account the fact that paragraph GEN.1.1 of Appendix FM of
    the Immigration Rules states that

         "The requirements of the Rules reflect how the  balance  should  be
         struck between the right to respect for private and family life and
         the legitimate aims of protecting national security, public  safety
         and the economic wellbeing of the UK...".

11. She proceeded at paragraph 27 of her determination to state that  "some
    provisions to the new Immigration Rules do not 'perfectly  mirror'  the
    common law principles developed over the past few years".

12. At paragraph 29 the judge found that circumstances  had  changed  since
    the application and stated if she were deciding the case nearer to  the
    date she perhaps would have found that requiring her to make a  further
    application would be reasonable although she proceeded

         "However at the date of the hearing the  appellant's  circumstances
         have changed in that her husband is  now  in  work.   The  evidence
         before me shows that he is likely to be earning an annual salary in
         excess of the ï¿½18,600 required in Appendix FM.  The appellant is an
         educated woman who has also been offered work."

13. In essence the judge found that the couple were now in  a  position  to
    support themselves without recourse to public funds.

14. At paragraph 30 the judge  also  found  that  the  appellant  had  been
    awarded a masters degree from a UK university which was  sufficient  to
    satisfy the English language requirements of Appendix FM.  She gave her
    evidence in English at the hearing without any apparent problem.

15. The judge then proceeded to consider Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL where
    the House of Lords concluded that it would only be comparatively rarely
    certainly in family cases involving children that an Article  8  appeal
    should be dismissed solely on the basis that it would be  proportionate
    for the appellant to apply for entry clearance abroad.

16. The judge therefore found at paragraph 32, that, on the evidence before
    her at the date of the hearing, the appellant would likely to  be  able
    to meet the substantive requirements of the Immigration Rules  relating
    to partners and that she did not have a poor immigration  history  such
    that it would be reasonable to expect her to return to Nigeria  "solely
    in order to make an application for entry clearance".



Application for Permission to Appeal

17. The Secretary of State made an application for permission to appeal  on
    the basis that MF Nigeria confirmed that the Immigration Rules  were  a
    complete code from the starting point  for  the  decision  maker.   Any
    Article 8 assessment should only  be  made  after  consideration  under
    those Rules.  It was made clear in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) that
    the Article 8 assessment should only be carried  out  when  there  were
    compelling circumstances not recognised by these Rules.  In  this  case
    the Tribunal did not identify such  compelling  circumstances  and  its
    findings were therefore unsustainable.

18. Gulshan also made clear that an appeal should  only  be  allowed  where
    there were exceptional circumstances (Nagre [2013]  EWHC  270  (Admin))
    and endorsed the Secretary  of  State's  guidance  on  the  meaning  of
    exceptional  circumstances  namely  where  refusal  would  lead  to  an
    unjustifiably harsh  outcome.   The  Tribunal  had  not  followed  this
    approach and therefore erred in law.

19. The judge  had  not  provided  any  adequate  reasons  as  to  why  the
    appellant's circumstances were either compelling or exceptional to make
    her removal disproportionate.  The  appellant  and  her  husband  began
    their relationship in the knowledge that she may be required  to  leave
    the UK and it was submitted the Tribunal therefore found there were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to the appellant and  her  partner  continuing
    their family life in Nigeria.

20. Permission to appeal was granted by Tribunal Judge Reed  on  3rd  March
    2014 on the basis that the judge had failed to adequately identify what
    compelling circumstances were not recognised by the Rules and had  also
    failed  to  adequately  explain  why  the  refusal  would  lead  to  an
    unjustifiably harsh outcome.

The Hearing

21. At the hearing Mr Tarlow relied  on  the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal. Further to Gulshan and  MF  there  needed  to  be
    exceptional or exceptionally harsh grounds in order  to  proceed  under
    the substantive Article 8.  There was nothing within  this  appeal,  as
    reflected in the determination, that reached such a level of difficulty
    for the appellant that the old style Article 8 would apply.   This  was
    simply a case where an application should be made from abroad  and  the
    appellant could return and make that application.

22. Miss Dogra stated that paragraph 32 of the determination had been taken
    out of context.  The determination should be read as  a  whole  and  in
    particular paragraphs 23 to 33 set out the reasons in  detail  why  the
    judge allowed the appeal.

23. First and foremost at the date of the hearing the appellant would  have
    satisfied the Immigration Rules and the judge made detailed findings on
    this.

24. Further the judge had taken into account the immigration history of the
    appellant and noted that she was here lawfully.  Further to  E-LTRP.1.1
    she was not in the UK as a visitor and thus at the date of the  hearing
    she could have  satisfied  R-LTRP1.1(c).   The  appellant  had  a  good
    immigration history and thus there were grounds that she could consider
    beyond the Rules.

25. Also there was no good reason why the  appellant  should  go  back  and
    Judge Canavan  at  paragraph  31  had  given  a  valid  explanation  of
    Chikwamba and had addressed her mind to this and did not consider  that
    it was proportionate to ask the appellant to make  an  out  of  country
    application.

26. Mr Tarlow  submitted  that  there  was  nothing  which  came  into  the
    compelling circumstances of paragraph 24 of Gulshan.

Conclusions and Findings

27. In particular I note paragraph 24(b)  of  Gulshan  which  states  after
    applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may  arguably  be
    good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them is it  necessary
    for Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them  Nagre.



28. I find that the judge had quite clearly  gone  into  an  assessment  of
    whether the appellant could satisfy the Immigration Rules and  this  is
    set out at paragraphs 9 to 22  of  her  determination.   She  noted  at
    paragraph 10 the exact Immigration Rule  R-LTRP1.1  and  she  noted  at
    paragraph 11 the reasons why the  appellant  could  not  succeed  under
    paragraph 1.1(c) because of the financial requirements.  The  appellant
    had also failed the English language requirement and thus fell short of
    meeting all the eligibility requirements for the purposes of R-LTRP1.1.
     It is clear that the judge was fully aware of Gulshan and indeed  this
    is cited at paragraph 19.

29. However I can appreciate that the  judge  referred  to  the  phrase  of
    insurmountable obstacles as cited in  MF  Nigeria  and  indicated  that
    there were no insurmountable obstacles.

30. She nevertheless went on to make a consideration outside the Rules.

31. Gulshan sets out the term

         "Insurmountable obstacles were not obstacles which were  impossible
         to surmount but concerned the practical possibilities of relocation
         and 'in the absence of such insurmountable obstacles, if removal is
         to be disproportionate it is necessary to show  other  non-standard
         and  particular  features  demonstrating  that  removal   will   be
         unjustifiably harsh...' Nagre."

32. However as the judge stated by the time that the matter came before her
    the appellant would have satisfied the requirements in her view  of  R-
    LTRP1.1 and it was on this basis  that  she  took  the  matter  forward
    particularly in view of the appellant's good  immigration  history  and
    found  further  to  Chikwamba  v   Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2008] UKHL 40 that

         "Whilst it acknowledged that there may  be  some  cases  where  the
         immigration history is so  poor  that  it  might  be  necessary  to
         require them to apply from abroad, the  House  of  Lords  concluded
         that it would only be comparatively  rarely,  certainly  in  family
         cases involving children,  that  an  Article  8  appeal  should  be
         dismissed solely on the basis that it would  be  proportionate  for
         the appellant to apply for entry clearance abroad."

33. Although the judge did not specifically spell out what  she  considered
    were "arguably be good grounds for granting leave  to  remain  outside"
    the rules she nevertheless made it clear from an overall reading of the
    determination, not least through the application of Chikwamba, which is
    still good law.

34. I therefore find that there was in  essence  a  disagreement  with  the
    judge's decision which, although it may have been generous, was open to
    the judge on the findings made by her.

35. I therefore find there is no error of law in this determination and the
    determination shall stand.
