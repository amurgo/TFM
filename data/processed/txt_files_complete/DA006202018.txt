Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Hussain instructed by Alison Law Solicitors LLP

For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. Following a hearing on 19 March 2019 the Upper Tribunal found a judge
       of the First-Tier Tribunal had erred in law for the reasons  set  out
       in the Error of Law Finding and Reasons decision  promulgated  on  22
       March 2019, a copy of  which  is  set  out  at  Appendix  A  of  this
       decision.

    2. The matter comes back before the  Upper  Tribunal  to  enable  it  to
       reconsider this matter with a view  to  substituting  a  decision  to
       either allow or dismiss the appeal.

Background


    3. The issue at large is a narrow one but one of fundamental importance,
       namely whether or not withstanding the fact the appellant has been in
       the United Kingdom since April 2006, and acquired 12 years  residence
       before the date of the decision to deport him from the United Kingdom
       on 25 September 2018, his conduct based primarily upon  his  acts  of
       criminality has been sufficient to break his integration links to the
       United Kingdom.

    4. Mr Diwnycz in his final submissions clarified his  position  that  he
       could not concede on the evidence that such ties had not been  broken
       but did not claim they had been fully broken, asserting they had been
       lessened. The question is whether  when  considering  the  extent  to
       which such ties exist the appellant has established he is entitled to
       the higher level of protection under EU law. As noted in the error of
       law finding it was not disputed that if it was found the appellant is
       entitled to the higher level of protection the appeal must succeed.

    5. Despite the clear directions having given regarding the provision  of
       all evidence upon which the  appellant  was  seeking  to  rely  by  a
       specified date, Mr Hussain advised the Tribunal  that  the  appellant
       had written a further statement and that family members had  attended
       who he wish to ask additional questions.  Such  an  approach  in  not
       putting in statements that a witness is seeking to  rely  upon,  when
       there is no reason made out why the solicitors did  not  comply  with
       directions, containing what may be fresh evidence by way  of  answers
       to questions put  in  evidence  in  chief,  is  that  the  responding
       advocate, in this case the Senior Presenting Officer, has  no  notice
       of the nature of such evidence. Mr Hussain was therefore  invited  to
       use the time available to the Tribunal to draft additional statements
       which could be considered by Mr Diwnycz to see whether admitting  the
       same presented any specific  difficulties.  As  a  result  a  further
       letter from the appellant dated  20  August  2019  together  with  an
       additional witness statement of 21 August 2019 was handed up together
       with a further statement from the appellant's girlfriend,  [LH]  also
       dated 21 August 2019, and a statement from [LH]'s  father,  Mr  [BH],
       also dated 21 August 2019.  Mr  Diwnycz  had  no  objection  to  such
       statements  being  admitted  and  all  witnesses  present  were  made
       available for the purposes of cross-examination re-examination.

    6. In addition to the case law set out in the error of law  finding  one
       further development is handing down  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  its
       decision in Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v  Franco
       Vomero [2019] UKSC 35.

    7. The  additional  written  evidence  from  the  appellant  is  in  the
       following terms:

           Letter 20 August 2019

           Dear, Excellency

           Your honour I appreciate you taking your time to read my  letter
           as I understand you are an exceptionally busy individual.

           You will be more than aware of my case, there are some aspects I
           want to address. I moved to England from my native Portugal when
           I was 10 years  old  for  a  better  way  of  life.  I  attained
           education in the United Kingdom, this  allowed  me  prosper  and
           become integrated into a better way  of  life.  I  have  made  a
           numerous amount of friends in my  community  also  not  so  good
           friends, which has caused my incarceration in the future, I will
           not associate with these people, wherever they may be.  If  they
           approach me I will use assertiveness further if necessary I will
           notify my local police  authorities.  I  have  been  in  regular
           employment and contributed by paying my taxes.

           I believe it is imperative to mention my stepmother is a  United
           Kingdom resident, she is my sole supporter without her  I  would
           be lost. Understandably if  I  was  deported  this  would  cause
           separation with my family.

           Throughout my sentence I have completed my sentence  plan  which
           is a requirement to  be  completed  whilst  in  HMP  custody.  I
           requested courses which may benefit to me, however  due  to  not
           meeting the criteria, I am unable to do this. This  is  open  to
           discussion with my probation officer, I am more than willing  to
           complete these additional courses in the community on release.

           My NOMIS will clarify this, my incentives was to  gain  enhanced
           status through this I have earned privileges  continuously  over
           the past 2 years. Wing staff consider me  to  be  polite  and  I
           always engage with prison regime. I have used my time in  prison
           productively by  gaining  additional  numerous  educational  and
           vocational qualifications,  which  will  give  me  advantage  in
           helping me get a job when I am released.

           I deeply regret my actions which led to my offence. I am  honest
           enough to admit I deserved to be imprisoned this  has  given  me
           time to reflect. Indisputably I have learnt my lesson  and  have
           no intentions of returning to jail. In the future I  would  like
           to become a role model in my community explaining  to  teenagers
           the perils of  becoming  involved  in  criminal  activities  and
           breaking the law. I would explain to them this is not  the  best
           pathway to choose along with spelling out the harsh  reality  of
           prison life.

           Intrinsically I believe I am a  decent  hard-working  individual
           who quite simply made a life changing mistake. Therefore I  will
           be extremely grateful if you could have mercy on me by  allowing
           me to remain in the United Kingdom with my family.




           Witness statement 21 August 2019

           Whilst in prison I have seen directly the impact of  drugs.  For
           example a number of prisoners addicted  to  drugs,  having  been
           sentenced to crimes committed in order to fund their addiction.

           It has given me insight that  selling  drugs  has  far  reaching
           implications for society at large.

           This week I have been given a trusted prisoner status on account
           of my exemplary record as an inmate.

           Whilst in prison I have been visited by my family on the maximum
           number of times allowed and have maintained a close relationship
           with my partner, stepmother, father, siblings and friends.  They
           have all been very consistent in maintaining contact with me and
           supporting me during my sentence.

           Since in prison I have a new baby brother, [J] who is 10  months
           old. I've been very fortunate that my stepmother and father  had
           bought my siblings to visit me - [V] (21), [L] (11) [D] (6)  [E]
           (4) which has allowed me to maintain close links with all of  my
           family.

           In addition to that [LH] has visited me every two weeks (maximum
           allowed) without fail, and we very much remain a couple and plan
           to continue our life together, once I am released.

    8. Prior to his imprisonment the appellant  had  established  what  many
       would see as a good and productive  life  as  a  young  man  who  had
       received an education, obtained employment, had a strong relationship
       with his girlfriend and with the  family  available  to  him  in  the
       United Kingdom. This is reflected in the comments of  the  Sentencing
       Judge, Judge Tremberg, who in the sentencing remarks of 14  September
       2017 stated:

           "You pleaded guilty, at what I accept  as  the  first  available
           opportunity, on a written basis and, in broad terms, I  sentence
           you broadly in accordance with it. You are a man who has several
           advantages that most of the defendants who appear in the dock of
           criminal courts never have.  You  come  from  a  supportive  and
           decent family, some of whom are still here standing  by  you  at
           court today. You are well educated, intelligent, you are in work
           - or you were - and you have a circle of decent friends who  the
           court sees in  the  public  gallery,  young  gentleman  who  are
           clearly from, themselves, decent backgrounds. And yet, over  the
           past months of your life, your life appears to  have  unravelled
           as you have pressed  the  self-destruct  button  not  once,  not
           twice, but three times."

    9. The appellant was sentenced for supplying Crack  Cocaine  to  another
       between 23 June 2017 and 25 July 2017 and an  offence  of  possession
       with intent to supply Cocaine on 25 July 2017. The  Sentencing  Judge
       noted that these offences were  committed  after  the  appellant  had
       appeared in court in May 2017 and received a  sentence  of  9  months
       imprisonment suspended together with 250 hours  of  unpaid  work  for
       attacking another man. The sentence handed down to the  appellant  by
       the Crown Court was therefore both in relation to the drugs  -related
       offences which on the first count the appellant  received  40  months
       imprisonment, the second count  56  months  concurrent  and  for  his
       breach of the suspended sentence 7 months consecutive, making a total
       of 63 months in total or 5 years 3 months imprisonment.

   10. The chronology shows that the appellant acquired 10  years  residence
       in the United Kingdom prior to his arrest in May 2017 but that he was
       known to the authorities prior to this - see [21] of the Error of Law
       finding.

   11. The OASys assessment of 5 July 2018, at page 229 of  the  appellant's
       appeal bundle, which sets out the Review Sentence Plan -  Motivation,
       capacity to change and positive  factors;  confirms  the  appellant's
       motivation has changed during his period of imprisonment and that  he
       is very motivated to address his offending and that his  capacity  to
       change and to reduce offending has changed by the appellant accepting
       full responsibility for his actions in  recognising  the  impact  his
       actions have had on himself and his family. The  report  records  the
       appellant being issued with the victim awareness pack which he was at
       that stage still to complete. There is no evidence that the appellant
       has been the subject of adjudications or of concern  in  relation  to
       his behaviour in the prison environment. The report records that  the
       appellant has a very positive and constructive attitude towards using
       his time in custody  in  a  very  positive  way,  being  warning  and
       adjudication free.

   12. The attendance of the family at prison visits is evidence not of  the
       establishment of fresh strands of integration  but  evidence  of  the
       continuation of the strong links the appellant had formed within  the
       United Kingdom prior to his imprisonment.

   13. It cannot be disputed that the  appellant  has  through  his  conduct
       demonstrated a disregard for the laws of the United Kingdom but there
       is nothing from the prison regarding further offending and it is  not
       disputed the appellant has spent most of his life in the UK.

   14. The appellant's claim to have maintained strong family ties was  also
       supported by the witnesses who gave their evidence and  who,  despite
       detailed  but  appropriate  cross  examination   from   Mr   Diwnycz,
       maintained their stance that strong family bonds exist which have not
       been broken or substantially reduced by the appellant's behaviour.

   15. Two statements handed down on the day were from [LH], the appellant's
       girlfriend, and her father Mr [BH]. Both are dated 21 August 2019.

   16. [LH]'s statement is in addition to her earlier statements which  have
       been taken into account together with all the other written evidence.
       In her most recent statement [LH] states:

           "Whilst Nivaldo has been in prison, I  have  been  visiting  him
           every two weeks which is the maximum allowed.

           Since the last hearing my business has grown considerably to the
           point we are moving premises. I had  stated  previously  that  I
           would move to Portugal with Nivaldo, however this position is no
           longer as clear-cut, because  of  the  uncertainty  of  life  in
           Portugal, leaving my  family  in  the  UK,  having  never  lived
           abroad, and Brexit. I still live at home with my parents and  my
           financial situation does not permit me to live independently  as
           the business does not bringing sufficient money to do so.

   17. In his witness statement 21 August 2019 Mr [BH] wrote:

           "Nivaldo and my daughter  have  been  in  a  relationship  since
           2014/15. During that time Nivaldo was staying at our home 4 or 5
           nights a week. They were very much and still remain a close  and
           loving couple.

           I have discussed with [L] the prospect of her moving to Portugal
           with Nivaldo and share her concerns about the sustainability  of
           this (cost, language, employment prospects, Brexit  uncertainty,
           for example).

           When Nivaldo is released he is very much welcome to live with us
           and I'm prepared to  support  him  in  establishing  himself  in
           employment and as a couple."

   18. The oral evidence of Mr [H] confirmed he has the financial  resources
       and sufficient accommodation to enable his proposal to be implemented
       and sustained. Mr [H] is clearly devoted to his daughter  and  family
       and confirmed that whilst he was willing  to  do  what  he  could  to
       assist if the appellant was able to remain in the United  Kingdom  he
       would not provide financial assistance to the  appellant  if  he  was
       deported and his daughter remained  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  his
       resources are best utilised meeting the needs of his family. I do not
       take this as a statement  of  a  lack  of  strong  ties  between  the
       appellant and this family unit, Mr [H] in particular, but recognition
       by Mr [H] as a father that it is his children and  family  that  come
       first and who are his priority.

   19.  The  appellant's  educational  achievements  are  evidenced  by  the
       documents in the bundle as is his employment history.  Whilst  it  is
       accepted as a convicted prisoner the appellant may have  difficulties
       in the job market he is clearly committed to rebuilding the  life  he
       had previously which was only lost to him as a result of his criminal
       conduct.

   20. The Secretary  of  State's  representative  in  the  application  for
       permission to appeal asserted in this case the appellant had shown no
       desire to integrate into the United Kingdom. I do not find this  made
       out on the evidence. The appellant clearly integrated and developed a
       strong settled life in the UK prior to his imprisonment.  Whilst  the
       period of  incarceration  resulting  from  his  stupid  behaviour  of
       fighting and being injured involved in drugs is relevant to assessing
       whether such integration was lost, the assertion in the grounds  that
       such integration had been broken was not made out on the evidence and
       was not a stance adopted by Mr Diwnycz who,  realistically,  accepted
       that this is a person who has spent most of his life  in  the  United
       Kingdom.

   21. When looking at the integration question, in addition to the  factual
       matrix which I find the appellant has established as asserted in  the
       evidence it is necessary to consider the quality and strength of  the
       same and the nature of ties to the United Kingdom. An  assessment  of
       that as the starting point  clearly  shows  that  the  appellant  has
       established quality family, education, and  employment  ties  to  the
       United Kingdom. The  family  ties  remain  very  strong  despite  the
       appellant's  acts   of   criminality   and   subsequent   period   of
       imprisonment. Not only was the strength of such  ties  recognised  by
       the Sentencing Judge it is clear such ties continue to exist  at  the
       date of this hearing.

   22. I find on the basis of the evidence that the appellant has  made  out
       that his level of integration into the United Kingdom  is  sufficient
       to establish the requisite 10 years such that any decision to  remove
       him may not be taken  except  on  imperative  grounds.  His  conduct,
       whilst relevant to the strength of such ties, does not demonstrate he
       does not have the required strength and depth of integrative links or
       has lost the same.

   23. As noted above, it was  accepted  that  if  the  requisite  10  years
       continuous residence is made out  imperative  grounds  would  not  be
       established on the facts and accordingly I substitute a  decision  to
       allow this appeal.

   24. All parties to this case, those involved professionally,  and  family
       members hope this will be the last time Mr [M] is involved in acts of
       criminality leading to him  coming  before  the  courts.  Brexit  was
       mentioned in the evidence and it may be that if  the  United  Kingdom
       leaves the EU he will not have the benefit of the protection found in
       the Immigration (EEA) Regulations in  the  future.  Had  UK  domestic
       legislation been applicable, pursuant to the  UK  Borders  Act  2007,
       there is a strong possibility the appellant's appeal will have failed
       and he would be deported. This is the stark choice the appellant  may
       face in the future.

Decision

   25. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is allowed.

  Anonymity.

   26. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Representation:
For the Appellant: Mrs R Petterson - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent: Mr T Hussain instructed by Alison Law Solicitors.


                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS

    1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission a decision  of  First-
       Tier Tribunal Judge Saffer promulgated on 9 January 2019 in which the
       Judge allowed the above respondent's appeal against the  decision  to
       deport him from the United Kingdom pursuant to the Immigration  (EEA)
       Regulations 2016.

Background


    2. The above respondent is a citizen of  Portugal  born  on  5  December
       1995. On 25 September 2018 the Secretary of State made a  Deportation
       Order as a result of the above respondent being jailed for a total of
       5 years and 3 months on 14 September 2017, the total  sentence  being
       composed of:

        a. 3 years and 4 months for being concerned in the supply of  crack
           cocaine  with  a  street  value  of  �150,000,   that   to   run
           concurrently with

        b. 4 years and 8 months for possessing crack cocaine with intent to
           supply it, and

        c. a further 7 months to run concurrently for an assault  where  he
           breached a suspended prison sentence of 9 months from  May  2017
           (he was 21).

    3. The Judge accepted the record of convictions.  It  was  accepted  the
       above respondent moved to the United Kingdom in April 2006 and was in
       full-time education until July 2012,  exercising  EEA  Treaty  Rights
       during this period as accepted by the Secretary of State.  The  Judge
       found the  evidence  from  the  schools  compelling  which  was  also
       supported by evidence of the above respondent, his father and a  Miss
       Stevens [36]. The Judge accepted the above respondent enrolled  on  a
       BTEC Course and worked at Scunthorpe United until mid-2014  until  he
       was imprisonment in September 2017. The Judge was satisfied the above
       respondent was exercising EEA treaty rights from 2012 to 2017 [37].

    4. At [38] the Judge finds:

           "38.    Accordingly,  he  was  exercising  EEA   Treaty   Rights
                continuously and lawfully from 2006 to 2017 and had acquired
                the  highest  level  of  EEA   protection   prior   to   his
                imprisonment. Given that finding  his  appeal  must  succeed
                given the concession by Mr Spence  and  as  the  deportation
                letter does not asserts that the "imperative" test is met."

    5. The Judge finds at [39] it was not necessary to go through the  above
       respondent's offending behaviour or life in the UK  or  Portugal  but
       that had he been required to, or if he was wrong in relation  to  the
       length of the time the  applicant  has  been  exercising  EEA  Treaty
       rights, then [40 - 48] of the decision under challenge  would  apply.
       On the basis of findings made, which will be applicable if  only  the
       first or second levels of protection applied, the above  respondent's
       appeal under the EEA Regulations would  have  been  dismissed  as  it
       would pursuant to article 8 ECHR.

    6. The Secretary of  State  asserts  the  Judge  has  not  undertaken  a
       holistic approach when assessing the appellant's qualifying period of
       residence in the United Kingdom applying a purely binary  calculation
       to justify the heightened protection. The Secretary of State  asserts
       that a period of imprisonment in principle breaks the continuity when
       calculating the 10-year period necessary for protection from  removal
       on imperative grounds, such 10-year period to be  counted  back  from
       the date of the deportation/expulsion decision and not  the  date  of
       sentence of imprisonment. The grounds argue on that basis  the  above
       respondent cannot rely upon that provision.

    7. The grounds acknowledge that it is possible to rely in principle on a
       10 year period of residence before the first custodial  sentence  but
       it is argued the above respondent showed no desire to integrate prior
       to the custodial sentence handed down on 14  September  2017  as  the
       above respondent has been frequently involved  in  criminality  since
       2008, which the Secretary of  State  argues  breaks  any  integrative
       links. It is also argued  the  period  of  incarceration  would  have
       broken any integrative links that existed and that for those  reasons
       the above respondent cannot rely on "imperative" protection which  is
       not an absolute right. The grounds argue the Judge  has  fallen  into
       material misdirection by failing to  assess  the  imperative  grounds
       test adequately or in accordance with the case law and that there  is
       no assessment of the above respondent's integrative  links  and  that
       had the matter been properly assessed under regulation 27(3) based on
       'serious grounds' only the Secretary  of  State  argues  it  will  be
       proportionate to  deport  the  above  respondent  despite  his  long-
       standing connections with the UK.

    8. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of  the  First-Tier
       Tribunal on 29 January 2019 on the basis it was  arguable  the  Judge
       erred as stated in the grounds relating  to  the  assessment  of  the
       level of protection capable of affecting the outcome.

    9. The above respondent's position set out in the Rule 24  response,  as
       pleaded as follows:

           10 year residency

             i) It is the Respondent's case that the  Appellant's  claim  is
                misconceived in respect of the facts previously having  been
                presented to the FTT.

            ii) The Respondent relocated from Portugal to the United Kingdom
                in April 2006, aged 11 years.

           The Respondent had remained within the  United  Kingdom  as  his
           main residence until his arrest in May 2017 (a total duration of
           11 years). The Respondent avers that the conviction in September
           2017 was the  first  instance  of  when  he  was  subject  to  a
           custodial sentence and thereby his residence of 11  years  prior
           to the same clearly suffices in respect of proving his right  to
           permanent residency.

           iii) For reasons  aforementioned,  as  the  Respondent  had  duly
                resided within the UK for a continuous period  of  10  years
                before  any  time  of  imprisonment,  the  correct  test  to
                consider  would  have  been   'deportation   on   imperative
                grounds', which was applied by the FTT Judge accordingly.

           Integrative Links

            iv) The Appellant has also raised the  Respondent's  integrative
                links within the application, the Respondent avers that  his
                integration links had been discussed and considered  by  the
                FTT Judge within the initial appeal.

             v) It is the Respondent's  case  that  his  family  in  the  UK
                consists of the following: Biological Father,  Step  Mother,
                Biological  Sister,  4  Half  Brothers   and   her   Partner
                (relationship  spanning  over  3  years).  The  Respondent's
                Biological Mother resides in Angola and the only connections
                that the Respondent has in  Portugal  are  of  his  Father's
                cousins to which the Respondent  has  never  been  in  touch
                with.

            vi) The Respondent has completed his education in the UK as well
                as taking part in extracurricular activities  i.e.  training
                Younger players at Scunthorpe United Football Club.

           vii) The Respondent was also working at British  Steel  prior  to
                his arrest with a view to  collate  savings  to  purchase  a
                house with his Partner.

          viii) It is the Respondent's case that the above  said  assertions
                are sufficient to establish the  Respondent's  integrity  of
                links with the United Kingdom and its people.

           The Respondent also relies upon the requirement for  deportation
           to comply with the notion of proportionality  and  consideration
           should be given to the age/family/economic  situation/length  of
           residence/social cultural integration and links with country  of
           origin.

Error of law


   10. By virtue of Regulation 23(6) 2016 regulations an  EEA  national  who
       has entered the United  Kingdom  or  the  family  member  of  such  a
       national who has entered the United Kingdom may be  removed  if:  (a)
       that person does not have or ceases to have a right to  reside  under
       these Regulations; or (b) the Secretary of State has decided that the
       person's removal is justified on the grounds of public policy, public
       security or public health in accordance with regulation  27;  or  (c)
       the Secretary of State has  decided  that  the  person's  removal  is
       justified on grounds of misuse of rights under regulation 26(3).

   11. By virtue of Regulation 27(4) a decision to remove may not  be  taken
       except on imperative grounds of public security in respect of an  EEA
       national who (a) has resided in the United Kingdom for  a  continuous
       period of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision;  or  (b)
       is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision is necessary  in
       his best interests, as provided for in the Convention on  the  Rights
       of the Child adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on
       20th November 1989.

   12. The general approach is  in  two  stages  (i)  does  the  Appellant's
       conduct satisfy the applicable "public policy" criterion (whether the
       general one or the more or most stringent one); and (ii) if it  does,
       is  the  decision  to  remove  a  "proportionate"  one  in  all   the
       circumstances.

   13. In LG (Italy) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2008]
       EWCA Civ 190 the Court of Appeal confirmed that an EEA  national  who
       had been here for 10 years can only be deported on imperative grounds
       of public security, which bear a qualitative difference to  the  less
       stringent grounds applicable to deportation  of  those  with  shorter
       residence. Imperative connoted a very high threshold and  the  ground
       requires an actual and compelling risk  to  public  security,  though
       public security need not be equated to national security.  The  Court
       of Appeal said that "risk to the safety of the public or a section of
       the public" seemed reasonably consistent with the ordinary meaning of
       the test and seemed to be of the opinion that  the  severity  of  the
       offence  committed  was  not  necessarily   one   to   make   removal
       "imperative".

   14. In VP(Italy) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA
       Civ 806 the Court  of  Appeal  endorsed  LG  (Italy)  and  said  that
       imperative grounds of public security required not simply  a  serious
       matter of public policy but an actual  risk  to  public  security  so
       compelling that  it  justified  an  exceptional  course  of  removing
       someone who had become integrated by many years residence in the host
       state.  The severity of the offence could be  a  starting  point  for
       consideration but there  had  to  be  something  more  to  justify  a
       conclusion that that removal  was  imperative  to  the  interests  of
       public security.

   15. No arguable legal error arises from an analysis of  the  evidence  or
       findings if the Judge's conclusion  that  the  above  respondent  was
       entitled to the higher level of protection stands. The core issue  is
       therefore whether the finding the above respondent is entitled to the
       enhanced protection against expulsion is infected by  material  legal
       error.

   16. It is not challenged that the above respondent will have  acquired  a
       right of permanent residence, a  pre-requisite  to  establishing  the
       higher level of protection on the facts as found by the Judge,  which
       was conceded by the Secretary of State.

   17. The authorities relevant to  the  question  under  consideration  are
       Vomero [2016] UKSC 49 in which the  Supreme  Court  referred  to  the
       European Court of Justice the question  whether  enhanced  protection
       against deportation under Directive 2004/38 art.28(3)(a) depended  on
       an EU citizen's possession of a right of permanent  residence  within
       art.16 and art.28(2). It further asked  how  the  time  period  under
       which enhanced protection could be acquired was to be calculated, and
       the Judgement of the Grand Chamber following such a request.

   18. The CJEU decided in Vomero (C-316/16  and  C-  424/16)  that  it  was
       necessary for the EU citizen to have a right of  permanent  residence
       to benefit from the 10 year protection.  They clarified that the  10-
       year period does run back from the date of the expulsion decision but
       where a Union citizen had already resided in  the  MS  for  10  years
       before detention that did not automatically mean that the person  was
       deprived of the benefit  of  the  enhanced  protection.   An  overall
       assessment of the person's situation may lead to the conclusion  that
       notwithstanding the detention,  the  integrative  links  between  the
       person and the host MS have not been broken.  Those  aspects  include
       the strength of the integrative links forged  before  detention,  the
       nature of the offences which resulted in detention, the circumstances
       in which the offence was committed and  the  conduct  of  the  person
       during the period of detention.   The EEA regulations have  now  been
       amended to clarify that a permanent right of residence is needed  for
       the 10 year protection to be available.

   19. At [70 - 83] the Grand Chamber state:

           "70.   As to whether periods of imprisonment may, by  themselves
           and irrespective of periods of  absence  from  the  host  Member
           State, also lead, where appropriate, to a severing of  the  link
           with that State and  to  the  discontinuity  of  the  period  of
           residence in that State, the Court has held  that  although,  in
           principle, such periods of imprisonment interrupt the continuity
           of the period of residence, for the purpose of Article  28(3)(a)
           of Directive 2004/38, it is nevertheless necessary - in order to
           determine whether those periods of imprisonment have broken  the
           integrative links previously forged with the host  Member  State
           with the result that the person concerned is no longer  entitled
           to the enhanced protection provided for in that provision  -  to
           carry out an overall assessment of the situation of that  person
           at the precise time when the question of  expulsion  arises.  In
           the context of that overall assessment, periods of  imprisonment
           must be taken into consideration together with all the  relevant
           factors in each individual case, including, as the case may  be,
           the circumstance that the person concerned resided in  the  host
           Member State for the 10 years preceding his  imprisonment  (see,
           to that effect, judgment  of  16  January  2014,  G.,  C-400/12,
           EU:C:2014:9, paragraphs 33 to 38).

           71.    Indeed, particularly in the case of a Union  citizen  who
           was already in a position to satisfy the condition of 10  years'
           continuous residence in the host Member State in the past,  even
           before  he  committed  a  criminal  act  that  resulted  in  his
           detention, the fact that the  person  concerned  was  placed  in
           custody by the authorities of that State cannot be  regarded  as
           automatically breaking the integrative links  that  that  person
           had previously forged with that State and the continuity of  his
           residence in that State for the purpose of Article  28(3)(a)  of
           Directive 2004/38 and, therefore, depriving him of the  enhanced
           protection against expulsion provided  for  in  that  provision.
           Moreover, such an interpretation would deprive that provision of
           much of its practical effect, since an  expulsion  measure  will
           most often be adopted precisely because of the  conduct  of  the
           person concerned that led to his conviction and detention.

           72.    As part of the overall assessment, mentioned in paragraph
           70 above, which, in this case, is for  the  referring  court  to
           carry out, it is necessary to take into account, as regards  the
           integrative links forged by B with the host Member State  during
           the period of residence before his detention, the fact that, the
           more those  integrative  links  with  that  State  are  solid  -
           including from a social, cultural and family perspective, to the
           point where, for example,  the  person  concerned  is  genuinely
           rooted in the society of that State, as found by  the  referring
           court in the main proceedings - the lower the probability that a
           period of detention could have resulted  in  those  links  being
           broken and, consequently, a discontinuity of the 10-year  period
           of residence  referred  to  in  Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
           2004/38.

           73.    Other relevant factors in  that  overall  assessment  may
           include, as observed by the Advocate General in  points  123  to
           125 of his Opinion,  first,  the  nature  of  the  offence  that
           resulted in the period  of  imprisonment  in  question  and  the
           circumstances  in  which  that  offence  was   committed,   and,
           secondly, all the relevant factors as regards the  behaviour  of
           the person concerned during the period of imprisonment.

           74.    While the nature of the offence and the circumstances  in
           which it was committed shed light on the  extent  to  which  the
           person concerned has, as the case may  be,  become  disconnected
           from the society of the host Member State, the attitude  of  the
           person concerned during his detention may,  in  turn,  reinforce
           that disconnection or, conversely, help to maintain  or  restore
           links previously forged with the host Member State with  a  view
           to his future social reintegration in that State.

           75.    On that last point, it should also be borne in mind that,
           as the Court has already pointed out, the social  rehabilitation
           of the Union citizen  in  the  State  in  which  he  has  become
           genuinely integrated is not only in his  interest  but  also  in
           that of the European Union in general (judgment of  23  November
           2010, Tsakouridis, C-145/09, EU:C:2010:708, paragraph 50).

           76.    As regards the concerns expressed by the referring  court
           that taking into account the  period  of  imprisonment  for  the
           purposes  of  determining  whether  it   has   interrupted   the
           continuity of the 10-year period of residence in the host Member
           State prior to the expulsion measure could lead to arbitrary  or
           unfair results, depending on when that measure is adopted, it is
           appropriate to provide the following clarifications.

           77.    It is true that, in  some  Member  States,  an  expulsion
           measure may be imposed as a penalty or legal  consequence  of  a
           custodial sentence, a  possibility  expressly  provided  for  in
           Article 33(1) of Directive 2004/38. In such a case,  the  future
           custodial  sentence  cannot,  by  definition,  be   taken   into
           consideration for the purposes of assessing  whether  or  not  a
           Union citizen has been continuously resident in the host  Member
           State for the 10 years preceding the adoption of that  expulsion
           measure.

           78.    The result may therefore be, for example,  that  a  Union
           citizen who has already resided continuously for 10 years in the
           host Member State at the date on which he receives  a  custodial
           sentence accompanied by an expulsion measure is entitled to  the
           enhanced protection against expulsion provided  for  in  Article
           28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38.

           79.    Conversely, as regards a citizen  against  whom  such  an
           expulsion measure is adopted after his detention, as in the main
           proceedings, the question arises whether or not  that  detention
           had the effect of interrupting the continuity of the  period  of
           residence in the host Member State  and  depriving  him  of  the
           benefit of that enhanced protection.

           80.    However, it should be pointed out, in that regard,  that,
           where a Union citizen has already resided  in  the  host  Member
           State for a period of 10 years when his  detention  begins,  the
           fact that the expulsion measure is adopted during or at the  end
           of the period of detention and the  fact  that  that  period  of
           detention thus forms part of the 10-year  period  preceding  the
           adoption  of  that  measure  do  not  automatically   entail   a
           discontinuity of that 10-year period as a result  of  which  the
           person concerned would be deprived of  the  enhanced  protection
           provided for under Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38.

           81.    Indeed, as is apparent from paragraphs 66 to 75 above, if
           the expulsion decision is adopted during or at the  end  of  the
           period of detention, the situation of the citizen concerned must
           still, under the conditions laid down in  those  paragraphs,  be
           subject to an overall assessment in order to  determine  whether
           or not he can avail of that enhanced protection.

           82.    Thus, in the situations referred to in paragraphs  77  to
           81 of this judgment, whether  or  not  the  enhanced  protection
           provided for in Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 is granted
           will still depend on the duration of residence and the degree of
           integration of the citizen concerned in the host Member State.

           83.    In the light of all the  foregoing,  the  answer  to  the
           first three questions in Case C-316/16 is that Article  28(3)(a)
           of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the
           case of a Union citizen who is serving a custodial sentence  and
           against whom an expulsion decision is adopted, the condition  of
           having 'resided in the host Member State for  the  previous  ten
           years' laid down in that provision may  be  satisfied  where  an
           overall  assessment  of  the  person's  situation,  taking  into
           account all the relevant aspects, leads to the conclusion  that,
           notwithstanding that detention, the  integrative  links  between
           the person concerned and the host Member  State  have  not  been
           broken. Those aspects include, inter alia, the strength  of  the
           integrative links forged with the host Member State  before  the
           detention of the person concerned, the  nature  of  the  offence
           that  resulted  in  the  period  of   detention   imposed,   the
           circumstances in  which  that  offence  was  committed  and  the
           conduct  of  the  person  concerned  throughout  the  period  of
           detention.

   20. The date of the expulsion decision is 25 September  2018.   10  years
       back takes us to 25 September 2008. By that date the Judge accepts 12
       years residence in the United Kingdom exercising treaty rights (April
       2006 to September 2017).

   21. The Secretary of State's case is that the above respondent's  history
       of criminality clearly demonstrates a lack of integration based  upon
       acts contrary to the laws of the United Kingdom and  expectations  of
       how  individuals  who  have  integrated  will  behave.  The  document
       produced by the Criminal Casework Directorate reveals the following:

           "The appellant first came to the attention of the authorities in
           the United Kingdom  on  5  October  2008,  when  he  received  a
           reprimand from Humberside  Police  for  common  assault.  On  17
           January 2010 the appellant received a  warning  from  Humberside
           Police for 2 counts of battery.

           On 16 September 2010, at North Lincolnshire Juvenile Court,  the
           appellant was convicted of common assault  and  sentenced  to  a
           referral order of 6 months, with costs of �120  in  compensation
           of �100.

           On 22 December 2011, at North Lincolnshire Juvenile  Court,  the
           appellant was convicted of  assault  occasioning  actual  bodily
           harm. He was sentenced to a youth rehabilitation order, with  an
           activity requirement of 90 days and a supervision requirement of
           12 months.

           On 28 November 2013, at North Lincolnshire Juvenile  Court,  the
           appellant was convicted of an aggravated vehicle taking (taking)
           accident causing damage to property  other  than  vehicle  under
           5000GBP. The appellant was sentenced to  an  order  to  continue
           unpaid  work  requirement  consecutive  with  �20   costs.   The
           appellant was also convicted of using vehicle when uninsured and
           failing to report an accident.  He  was  sentenced  to  a  youth
           rehabilitation order with an unpaid  work  requirement  and  his
           driving licence was endorsed.

           On 16 May 2017, at Great Grimsby Crown Court, the appellant  was
           convicted of assaulting a person thereby occasioning them actual
           bodily harm. He was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended
           for 24 months, with an unpaid work requirement of 250 hours.

           The appellant first came to the attention of the Home Officers a
           result of a conviction on 14 September 2017 have been  concerned
           in supplying Class A controlled drug -  "Crack"  and  possessing
           with intent to supply a controlled drug of Class  A  -  Cocaine.
           The appellant was sentenced to 56 months  imprisonment.  He  was
           also given 7 months imprisonment consecutive for  breaching  the
           suspended sentence 16 May 2017.

           Consequently on 15 February 2018 he was served with  the  notice
           of liability to deportation.

   22. The Judge was aware of the above respondent's  offending  history  as
       that is clearly  referred  to  at  [4].  The  Judge  also  notes  the
       Sentencing Remarks at [5].

   23. There is no reference in the decision to information  concerning  the
       above respondent's conduct in prison.

   24. Whilst it is argued the Judge does not appear between [35  -  38]  to
       have considered  or  undertaken  an  examination  of  the  impact  of
       applicants  offending  behaviour  upon  any  break  in  period(s)  of
       integration, the Judge may have found no such breaks  occurred  as  a
       result of the finding at [38] that  the  above  respondent  has  been
       exercising treaty rights continuously lawfully from 2006 to 2017, but
       that could only be inferred as there is  no  express  examination  or
       finding upon this particular point, hence  the  Secretary  of  States
       challenge that the assessment of entitlement to  the  high  level  of
       protection is based upon a linear calculation and no more.

   25. Even though  from  [39]  the  Judge  examines  the  position  in  the
       alternative which is not his primary  finding,  some  of  the  points
       raised in the latter part of  the  decision  are  indicative  of  the
       Judges thought process. These include it being found the appellant is
       a serious and persistent offender who presents a genuine, present and
       sufficiently serious threat to society given his propensity to offend
       which appears to be a lifestyle choice  [40].  It  is  arguable  that
       somebody who deliberately chooses to flaunt the laws  of  the  United
       Kingdom is choosing not to integrate and be bound by such  laws.  The
       Judge finds prospects of rehabilitation in Portugal would  have  been
       better than those in the United Kingdom  as  those  in  the  UK  have
       failed [41].  The Judge  finds  the  respondent  has  a  genuine  and
       subsisting relationship with Ms Harding.  The  Judge  also  finds  no
       compelling reasons above those found in the Immigration Rules  as  to
       why the above respondent should  not  be  deported  indicating  those
       issues he was seeking to rely upon at that stage,  which  would  have
       included degree of integration, were not sufficient to  override  the
       public interest: although the Immigration Rules and not applicable to
       EEA matters.

   26. The Judge also notes the trigger offences were  not  committed  as  a
       child and were more serious  than  the  above  respondent's  juvenile
       offending.

   27. The decision in  this  case  was  reserved  following  completion  of
       submissions as it is clearly not a straightforward case. Even if  the
       decision of the Judge eventually proves to be the correct one I  find
       there is merit in the grounds relied upon by the Secretary  of  State
       that the Judge in concluding the above respondent is entitled to  the
       higher level of protection fails  to  properly  consider  and  assess
       whether the above respondent has shown no desire  to  integrate  into
       society of the United Kingdom or whether any integrating  links  that
       have been formed have been broken and, if so, to what extent.

   28. It was accepted at the hearing that that if that is  the  finding  of
       this Tribunal it would not be appropriate to revert  to  the  Judge's
       finding in the alternative as Mr Hussain indicated there are  further
       matters that he wished the Upper Tribunal to consider  when  deciding
       on the appropriate order when remaking the decision.

   29. On that basis the following directions  shall  apply  to  the  future
       management of this appeal (reference to the appellant below being  to
       Mr [M]):

        a. The decision of the  Judge  shall  be  set  aside.  Findings  in
           relation  to  the  appellants  family,  immigration,  education,
           employment, and criminality shall be preserved.

        b. The appellant's representative shall advise the  Upper  Tribunal
           no later than 14 days from receipt of this  decision  whether  a
           Production Order is required on the basis of the  need  for  the
           appellant to give oral evidence. If so the representative  shall
           also advise the Upper Tribunal if an interpreter is required and
           if so in which language.

        c. The appellant shall file a consolidated, indexed, and  paginated
           bundle no later than Friday, 19 April 2019  containing  all  the
           documentary evidence upon which he intends to rely and  serve  a
           copy of the same upon the representative  of  the  Secretary  of
           State. Witness statements in the bundle are to be signed, dated,
           contain a declaration of truth, and shall stand as the  evidence
           in chief of the maker, who shall be tendered for the purposes of
           cross-examination and re-examination only.

        d. The appeal shall be listed on the first available date  after  1
           May 2019, subject  to  the  availability  of  Mr  Hussain,  time
           estimate 3 hours. The venue of the hearing to be at  a  suitable
           centre in light of the appellant serving a custodial sentence.

Decision

   30. The First-tier Judge  materially  erred  in  law.  I  set  aside  the
       decision of  the  Judge.   This  appeal  shall  be  case  managed  in
       accordance with the above provisions to enable the Upper Tribunal  to
       substitute a decision to either allow or dismiss the appeal.

  Anonymity.

   31. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson
