Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms C Bexson (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Stephen Whitwell (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Wyman, promulgated on 4th September 2014, following a hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 20th August 2014.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed  the  appeal,  to  a  limited  extent,  of  Habeeb  Zain.   The
    Respondent subsequently applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen  of  India,  who  was  born  on  8th
    October 1986.  He  appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State to refuse  his  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student, such decision having been made on
    13th January 2014.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he was originally granted entry clearance
    on 5th May 2011, and his current leave to remain in the UK  expires  on
    29th July 2013.  However, on 19th July 2013, he made an application for
    further leave to remain.  He would like to study a diploma in  business
    studies at the London School of Business and Accountancy  which  is  an
    NQF level course.  He has passed his English test as  required  and  he
    has paid his course fees of ï¿½2,500.  However, the  Appellant  does  not
    have a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies [CAS]  because  this  has
    been withdrawn by his Tier 1 Sponsor because he did not attend  classes
    at his college when he suffered a serious assault on 8th  August  2013,
    that led to him being admitted to hospital,  and  receiving  treatment,
    with further appointments at that hospital.  The facts to  this  extent
    are uncontested.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge heard evidence and heard submissions.   The  submission  from
    the HOPO was that the Appellant had shown no real desire to  commit  to
    his studies.  He did not attend college until  December  2013,  and  he
    made no contact with the college between September and  November  2013,
    even though he had suffered the serious assault  on  8th  August  2013.
    The judge took the view that "this approach is a little harsh"  because
    the Appellant had been the victim of a serious assault in August  2013,
    and his nose had been broken, and he had suffered severe  bruising  all
    over his face, and there was documentary evidence to this  effect  (see
    paragraph 30).

 5. The judge also took the view that, although  the  bruising  would  have
    gone down, he "may have suffered from psychological problems  following
    the assault" because the attack was a completely unprovoked one in  his
    own home (paragraph 32).  The  judge  found  that  "there  are  serious
    mitigating circumstances in this case" and went  on  to  conclude  that
    "the appeal is remitted back to the Home Office with the recommendation
    that the Appellant is granted a limited period of 60 days in  which  to
    enrol at college" (paragraph 34).  He did not proceed  to  consider  an
    Article 8 claim in any detail (see paragraph 35) because he allowed the
    appeal.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge erred  in  law  because
    there is no basis in the Immigration Rules to grant leave to remain  as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant to the limited extent  of  requiring
    the Secretary of State to consider granting a 60-day period  to  enable
    the Appellant to enrol at college.  The judge may have been sympathetic
    to the Appellant, and he may  have  found  that  there  are  mitigating
    factors, but  there  was  no  power  of  discretion  conferred  by  the
    Immigration Rules to make a recommendation to the  Secretary  of  State
    that she grant a 60-day period to enable him to enrol at a college.

 7. On 15th October 2014, permission to appeal was  granted  on  the  basis
    that no discretion exists to remit the matter back to the Respondent to
    review its decision and permit the 60-day extension.

Submissions

 8. Mr Whitwell, appearing on behalf  of  the  Respondent,  submitted  that
    there was no power conferred on a judge to make recommendation that the
    Secretary of State grant a period of 60 days  in  which  the  Appellant
    could find a college.  This was not the kind of situation envisaged  in
    Patel where a previously authorised college,  is  then  taken  off  the
    register  by  the  Secretary  of  State,  thus  placing  a  student  in
    difficulty through no fault of his own.

 9. Rather, what this was, was an issue between the Appellant  student  and
    his college.  He had not attended the college.  The college  could  not
    let him recommence his studies until the new academic year began.  This
    was not a matter in which the Secretary of State was remotely involved.
     If there was no CAS, it was not for the Secretary of State to grant  a
    60-day period to enable an Appellant student to get a CAS.

10. For her part, Ms Bexson submitted that the judge did ask the Presenting
    Officer at the hearing to  make  a  telephone  call  and  take  further
    instructions from the department as to whether the Appellant  could  be
    granted a 60-day period of grace.  This was  raised  as  a  preliminary
    issue at the outset of the  hearing.   But  the  Respondent  Presenting
    Officer did not make the telephone call.  Therefore,  the  judge  heard
    evidence.  After hearing the evidence, the judge was of the  view  that
    the Appellant was credible in what he said, and that  the  decision  of
    the Respondent with respect to his predicament  was  "a  little  harsh"
    (paragraph 30).  In the circumstances, it was not a material error  for
    the judge to remit the matter to the Secretary of  State  because  this
    was not interfering with the discretion of the Secretary  of  State  in
    any way but only requesting that she reconsider the matter.

11. In reply, Mr Whitwell submitted that if one considers  the  information
    at pages 11 to 15, it is clear that the injuries, the attendance at the
    GP, and the involvement of the Metropolitan Police, was a  time  period
    in which the Appellant could have informed his college of his injuries,
    but chose not to do so, thereby  raising  a  question  mark  about  his
    commitment as a student.

Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision and remake the decision
    (see  Section  12(2)  of  TCEA  2007).   I  come  to  this   conclusion
    notwithstanding Ms Bexson's very  persuasive  and  elegant  submissions
    before me.

13. Whilst I accept that the judge was entitled to come to the findings  of
    fact that he did, having heard the evidence, and was even  entitled  to
    properly conclude that the position taken by the Secretary of State was
    one whereby "this approach is a little harsh" (paragraph 30), the  fact
    is that the judge did not have the power to make "a recommendation that
    the Appellant is granted a limited period of 60 days" (paragraph 34) in
    this case.  The Appellant did not have a CAS because he did not  attend
    his college.

14. The suggestion that there be a recommendation of 60 days was to put his
    position on par with that where a college has had its  favoured  status
    withdrawn by an act of  the  Secretary  of  State  herself,  such  that
    provision is made to enable a student in those  circumstances  to  find
    another college during a period  of  60  days.   This  is  a  different
    situation.  There is no such power available.

Remaking the Decision

15. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am dismissing the  appeal  for  the  reasons  already  given,
    namely, that there is no power to recommend that leave be granted for a
    "limited period of 60 days in which to enrol at college", as  there  is
    no statutory or rule-based basis for the exercise of such power.

16.  If it can be said to exist in  these  circumstances,  it  is  just  as
    easily arguable that it can exist in any other  set  of  circumstances.
    Such a conclusion can properly only be drawn if a Rule can be found for
    the exercise of such discretion.  None exists.  None  was  referred  to
    me.

Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    dismissed.

18. No anonymity order is made.
