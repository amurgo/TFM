                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

1.   This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FTT), which dismissed his appeal against the refusal  of  the
    respondent to grant him further leave to remain.

2.   By way of background the appellant was given leave to enter the  UK  as
    a student until 1 January 2011 and on 16  September  2010  he  obtained
    leave to remain as a student until 30 March 2012.  He  was  then  given
    further leave to remain on 7 August 2012 as a Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)
    Migrant until 7 August 2013. Therefore, 7 August  2014  was  a  crucial
    date for him, because his leave was due to expire on that date.

3.   On 7 August 2014, the appellant  applied  form  for  further  leave  to
    remain.  There is an issue as to what then happened.  According to  the
    Immigration Judge who determined the appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge of the First-tier Tribunal N Lodge - the Immigration Judge)  the
    application was presented for payment on 8 August  2014.   However,  it
    was accepted by both parties at the hearing in the Upper Tribunal  that
    this date is incorrect. The correct date for  presentation  of  payment
    was in fact 11 August 2014.  Pausing there, one of the  crucial  issues
    in the case is whether  that  makes  any  material  difference  to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

4.   The respondent's decision under appeal was the decision on 19  November
    2014 to refuse further leave to remain. The background to that is  that
    the original application was made on 7 August 2014 but due to the  lack
    of the correct fee it was rejected on 14 August. The Appellant  had  to
    submit a fresh application  on  27  August  2014.  By  that  time,  the
    appellant's leave had already expired on 8 August 2014.

5.   The appellant's  appeal  came  on  for  hearing  on  8  March  2017  at
    Birmingham before the Immigration Judge. Miss R Ramsey, a  Home  Office
    Presenting  Officer  appeared  for  the  respondent  at  that  hearing.
    Despite being represented by a firm of solicitors,  the  appellant  did
    not attend the hearing or  make  any  written  representations.     The
    appellant submitted a fresh application on 27 August but by that  stage
    his leave had  expired.   The  Immigration  Judge  was  presented  with
    representations by the respondent but very little information from  the
    appellant's representative.  He did have  the  grounds  of  appeal  and
    additional grounds of appeal.  Those grounds of appeal state  that  the
    refusal notice  contained  no  assessment  of  the  evidence  about  to
    attributes.  Secondly, the Secretary of State had awarded no points for
    maintenance/funds. It is alleged that was  erroneous  because  he  held
    funds of the Regulated Financial Institution. It was  averred  that  if
    the Secretary of State had assessed the evidence to support  investment
    funds which the appellant held she would have concluded that he  scored
    the necessary points under  both  Appendices  A  and  C  and  that  the
    appellant provided sufficient  evidence  to  demonstrate  that  he  had
    access to the funds of over �50,000.

6.   I have been helpfully provided with an attendance note of  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  I am conscious  that  the  appellant's
    representative had not had prior sight of that and obviously was not at
    the hearing to which it related, but it appears from that document that
    there was a brief outline of  the  application  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The explanation for the rejection of the application given to
    the Immigration Judge was that there  had  been  an  unpaid  fee.   The
    appellant's leave then expired and there was a new application with  no
    leave and no right of appeal. The appellant then sought  to  judicially
    review of that  refusal  to  recognise  the  right  of  appeal.   Upper
    Tribunal Judge  Grubb  refused  permission  to  judicially  review  the
    decision on 14 October 2014.

7.   Mr Bramble went on to explain that there had been no attendance at  the
    Case Management Review and no indication prior to the hearing that  any
    documents were to be submitted.  The relevant bank  statement  appeared
    to have been provided in support of the  judicial  review  application.
    The appellant held the account in the joint names of himself and  a  Mr
    Singh. It has a sort code of 20-58-83 and the last four digits  of  the
    account number are 6383.  It is clear from the bank statement  that  as
    at 11 August, when it is contended the application was presented, there
    was �1,409.99 in the account; more than sufficient funds to  cover  the
    respondent's fee which was �1,093.   However,  it  is  clear  from  the
    attendance  note  that  there  was  no  one  in  attendance  from   the
    appellant's side.

8.   The Immigration Judge was referred to the case of  Basnet  [2012]  UKUT
    113. The  Immigration  Judge  regarded  the  burden  as  being  on  the
    appellant to show that he did have sufficient funds  to  discharge  the
    debt to the  Home  Office  at  the  material  date  (the  date  of  the
    application). Otherwise, the appellant would have had no leave  at  the
    time of that application. Therefore, it was clear  to  the  Immigration
    Judge that this was an  invalid  application  and  on  that  basis,  he
    decided to dismiss the appeal.

Discussion

9.   I did not find the law in this area straightforward, or  clear,  but  I
    have had an opportunity to fully consider the case of  Basnet.  It  was
    submitted that the Immigration Judge was wrong to  have  dismissed  the
    appeal as the original application had  been  valid.  Ms  Victor-Mazeli
    submitted that at the date the application was  considered,  11  August
    2014, there ought  to  have  been  sufficient  funds  in  the  account.
    However, she accepted that the  bank  rejected  the  application.   She
    could not explain why, but she  accepted  that  no  evidence  had  been
    supplied to the respondent from the bank to explain why it had rejected
    the application.

10.  Mr Bramble for the respondent on the other hand,  considered  that  the
    documents supplied by the appellant were wholly inadequate in terms  of
    discharging the burden which, he said, rested on the appellant to  show
    why the bank had refused the application for payment.  He accepted that
    the burden rested upon the respondent to show that the application  had
    indeed been rejected.  That in fact was not in issue and therefore  the
    burden effectively shifted to the appellant to show why  the  bank  had
    rejected the application.  The appellant had been unable  to  discharge
    that burden, but had  placed  no  material  before  the  court  or  the
    Tribunal  on  the  previous  occasion.  In   the   circumstances,   the
    Immigration Judge was entitled to come to the decision he  came  to  on
    the evidence and arguments presented to him.  It would have  been  open
    to the  appellant,  either  to  attend  the  hearing  and  explain  his
    position, produce documents in support of his arguments  or  put  in  a
    written submission or write a letter, but he did not do so.

11.      The appellant's representative said in  reply  that  the  8  August
    2014 was not  the  relevant  date.  The  issue  was:  what  funds  were
    available at the correct date i.e. 11 August 2014? Ms Victor Mazeli did
    not accept Mr Bramble's submission  that  it  was  incumbent  upon  her
    client, or her client's representatives, to  present  the  evidence  or
    facts before the Immigration Judge on the previous occasion so he could
    make a decision.  At the end of the hearing I retired for a short  time
    but then announced my decision to dismiss the appeal.  My  reasons  now
    follow.

My Conclusions

12.  Having carefully considered the arguments I have had to  remind  myself
    of the principles in the case of Basnet.  In the case of  Basnet  there
    was an application made by the applicant and the issue was  whether  it
    was accompanied by the relevant  fee.   It  is  right  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal in that case did place the burden of  establishing  the  facts
    upon the party who asserts them and they said at paragraph  27  of  the
    decision:

         "The party that asserts a fact  should  normally  be  the  one  who
         demonstrates it; and because the respondent is responsible for  the
         procedure to be used in postal cases, and the features noted  above
         prevent both the issue of a prompt receipt and  an  opportunity  to
         understand why payment was  not  processed.  An  applicant  is  not
         present when an attempt to process payment is made, and has no  way
         of later obtaining the relevant information."

13.  The burden therefore rests on the Secretary of State to show  that  the
    relevant fee has not been paid. However, the circumstances of that case
    are slightly different from those in this case. The important point  to
    make is  that  the  applicant  must  provide  information  as  to  what
    information he supplied at the time of making the application  so  that
    payment may be obtained by the respondent. Whether it is by  sending  a
    cheque in the post or by submitting a direct debit  or  whatever  other
    means of payment is used, it is difficult to see  that  the  respondent
    can investigate the matter at all if  an  application  for  payment  is
    simply rejected  by  the  bank  and  the  applicant  then  proffers  no
    explanation.  At paragraph 30 of the same decision  the  appellant  was
    described as an intelligent  young  man  who  was  well  aware  of  the
    importance of  accurately  completing  the  application  form.  He  had
    satisfied the respondent that he had the funds in the  account  at  all
    material times and he made a statement  that  he  is  certain  that  he
    provided the correct financial data.  Those facts were  different  from
    these.

14.  In this case there is no evidence at all as to why,  when  payment  was
    asked for on 11 August 2014, it was not forthcoming.  The present  fees
    structure came into force on 6 April 2013 and had therefore been around
    for some time.  Information could have  been  obtained  from  the  Home
    Office website as to exactly how to make payments and what  information
    was needed in support of an application.  The box that  was  ticked  on
    the original refusal (on 14 August 2014) was the box which said that:

         "Although credit and debit  card  details  had  been  provided  the
         issuing  bank  rejected  the  payments.   There   may   have   been
         insufficient funds in the account or details provided did not match
         the information held by the bank.  For security  reasons  the  card
         holder's name,  address  and  expiry  date  and  the  issue  number
         supplied on the payment form must  correspond  to  the  information
         held by the issuing bank.  If the details fail to match  the  bank,
         the bank will reject the payment.  Your fresh application should be
         returned to the address given on the application form."


15.  I take the view that it was incumbent on the appellant  to  attend  the
    hearing or provide some written representation before  the  Immigration
    Judge to explain why the original payment had not been made.  The  fact
    of whether or not the correct fee was supplied was exclusively  in  his
    possession. This is not a case where, like  in  Basnet,  the  appellant
    completed the correct form and  gave  evidence  that  he  supplied  the
    correct fee which was payable from  an  account  in  which  there  were
    adequate funds. It was not good enough simply to supply bank statements
    which indicated a sufficient balance in an account.  Bank accounts  can
    show a credit balance but there may be  a  set-off,  which  may  go  to
    reduce the overall balance in that account. The  explanation  may  well
    have been that he failed to put a correct digit on the form or internet
    application when he submitted his application form to  the  respondent.
    It is impossible to see how the respondent could  have  the  burden  of
    showing the nature of the mistake or  deficiency.  The  respondent  has
    discharged  the  burden  of  showing  that  the  application  was   not
    accompanied by the correct fee and there must then be a burden  on  the
    appellant to establish that in fact he supplied all the information  he
    should have supplied.

16.  In those circumstances, as the  Immigration  Judge  was  provided  with
    very limited evidence by the appellant, he was placed  in  a  difficult
    position. He did his best to decide the case on the limited information
    he was given and due to the appellant's failure to attend  the  hearing
    or place any submissions or documents before the Immigration Judge,  it
    is difficult to see how he could have come to  a  different  conclusion
    than the one he came to. In particular, it appears that the Immigration
    Judge had before him an application form completed by the appellant  on
    7 August 2014 and a Home Office printout, which stated  that  the  'fee
    (had) not (been) paid'.  It is clear looking at the bank account for  7
    August 2014 that he did not have such funds at the  time  he  submitted
    the application on that day and he therefore took a grave risk that  it
    would be rejected.  It is right to say that within a few  days  he  may
    well have had the  funds  but  all  he  needed  to  do  was  to  obtain
    information from his bank explaining  why  the  payment  had  not  gone
    through. Had he done that, it may  well  be  that  he  would  be  in  a
    different position than the position he is in.

17.  Whilst I have  got  some  sympathy  for  the  appellant,  I  find  that
    although the Immigration Judge's decision contains an error in relation
    to the factual details and the date the payment was presented, it  does
    not contain a material error. Even if the  appellant's  application  to
    pay was presented on 11 August  2014,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant had given information  to  justify  the  appellant's  factual
    assertion that he did have the funds at that date. On  the  balance  of
    probabilities, as the respondent was able to show that the  application
    was rejected for lack of funds it  was  for   the  appellant  to  show,
    nevertheless, that had the required funds available and that state  was
    one for which he was not responsible, for  example,  by  his  bank.  He
    failed to provide the respondent with all  the  information  he  should
    have supplied to enable the respondent to draw down those funds.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is by the appellant to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  dismissed.  The
decision of the First-Tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appeal  against  the
respondent's decision of 19 November  2014  to  refuse  to  grant  leave  to
remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
