For the Respondent:    Mr R Singer of Counsel instructed by Sriharans
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application  for  permission  to  appeal  was  made  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, nevertheless I shall refer to the  parties  as  they
    were  described  before  the   First-tier   Tribunal,   that   is   Mrs
    Kanakarathinam as the appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer as  the
    respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, born on 3 June  1987  and  she
    made an application on 13 February 2013 for a spousal visa  further  to
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 3. This application was refused on 28 May 2013  with  an  Entry  Clearance
    Manager decision of 6 December 2013.  The  refusal  was  based  on  the
    genuineness of the relationship further  to  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  In addition it was stated by the
    Entry Clearance Officer that the appellant had not  provided  specified
    documents  as  evidence  of  the  sponsor's  gross  income  from  their
    employment, such as a letter  from  the  employer  containing  all  the
    specified information, specifically confirmation as to  the  nature  of
    the sponsor's employment such as whether it was a  permanent  contract,
    wage slips for the six months prior to the application, the most recent
    of which should be dated within 28 days of the  application  (the  most
    recent of those was 26 January 2013) and also bank statements  for  the
    same period as the wage slips showing deposits consistent with the  net
    salary shown on the wage slips submitted.

 4. The appellant had submitted bank statements for  Sponsor's  Lloyds  TSB
    covering the period 7 June 2012 to 8 January 2013 only, and none of the
    net salary figures shown on the payslips submitted  were  reflected  in
    the bank statements submitted.  Nor were there deposits to the  account
    around the dates shown on her wage slips broadly  consistent  with  the
    sums detailed on her wage slips suggesting a significant portion of the
    wages  had  been  deposited  to  the  account.   These  documents  were
    specified as being required in the Immigration Rules at Appendix  FM-SE
    and should be provided.  The application was therefore refused under EC-
    P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules E-ECP3.1.

 5. The Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the  appellant  had
    satisfactory accommodation.

 6. Application for permission to appeal was made by the respondent on  the
    basis that First-tier Tribunal Judge Finch had allowed  the  appeal  on
    the basis of Article 8 but had failed to undertake any assessment  with
    regards  to  Article  8.   The  Rules  and  specified   evidence   were
    comprehensively set out in Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules  and
    covered the periods and the formats that the evidence should take.  The
    Tribunal had no regard to this at paragraph 15 of the determination and
    the Tribunal had failed to comply with the Immigration  Rules  and  the
    findings were unsustainable.  For example wage slips covering a  period
    of six months at  the  date  of  application  should  be  provided  and
    personal bank statements corresponding to the same period as  the  wage
    slips at paragraph 2(a) showing the  salary  had  been  paid  into  the
    account in the name of the person or their partner jointly.

 7. The appellant could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE for the
    six month period prior to the date of the application as the  sponsor's
    wages were not shown to be deposited into his bank account.  These were
    mandatory  requirements  and  must  be  fulfilled   and   are   clearly
    stipulated.

 8. The appellant could not succeed under the Rules.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes
    who acknowledged that the judge found  the  marriage  was  genuine  and
    subsisting and the appellant and sponsor intended  to  live  with  each
    other but the judge had not regard to paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE and
    the evidence to be provided in support of  the  mandatory  requirements
    had not been met.

10. The determination did not contain a proper analysis of the  Immigration
    Rules or an explanation why it was appropriate to consider the position
    outside the Immigration Rules under Article 8.

11. A response was submitted by Guy Davison of Counsel who  submitted  that
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Finch's judgment was an obvious misprint  and
    she did not include any earlier discussion of  Article  8  and  clearly
    intended to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.   (Paragraphs
    12, 15 and 16).

12. In the light of the above findings it was submitted that, and  contrary
    to the appellant's contention it was not correct that Judge  Finch  had
    no regard for the requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.

13. Rule 2(c) of Appendix FM-SE required the respondent sponsor to  provide
    bank statements showing his salary being paid  into  his  bank  account
    over a period of six months prior to the application.   There  was,  it
    was argued, no requirement that all of the sponsor's salary  must  have
    been paid into this account or that he could not show that some of  his
    salary was refused to make direct rental payment.

14. Judge Finch found that  the  appellant  had  produced  bank  statements
    showing the salary being paid into the account, albeit not on a regular
    day and in a regular amount.  She accepted  the  sponsor's  account  of
    these irregularities.  The respondent was illegitimately attempting  to
    challenge the finding of fact.

15. Alternatively, the respondent sought to rely on Article 8  in  addition
    to the Immigration Rules in any re-hearing.

Conclusion

16. I accept in accordance with the submissions of both Mr Davison  and  Mr
    Singer that Judge Finch  had  merely  by  way  of  typographical  error
    referred to allowing the appellant's appeal  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights as opposed to under the Immigration
    Rules and this was clear from a reading of the  decision  as  a  whole.
    There was no substantive discussion of Article 8 and the judge set  out
    at paragraph 7 that she had taken into account the  criteria  contained
    in Section E ECP 3.1 of Appendix FM.

17. At the outset I will set out that Mr Tufan conceded that the judge  had
    accepted  that  the  relationship  was   a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship and that there was no challenge by the respondent save for
    the challenge in relation to the financial requirements.

18. I therefore have set out the Immigration Rules in relation to  Appendix
    FM-SE.

         "In  respect  of  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:

          (a) Pay slips covering:

             (i)  a period of 6 months prior to the date of application  if
                  the person has been employed by their current employer for
                  at least 6 months  (and  where  paragraph  13(b)  of  this
                  appendix does not apply); or

             (ii) any period of salaried employment in  the  period  of  12
                  months prior to the date of application if the person  has
                  been employed by their current employer for  less  than  6
                  months...

         (b)  A letter from the employer(s) who  issued  the  pay  slips  at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming:

              (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;

             (ii) the length of their employment;

             (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid the
                  level of salary relied on in the application; and

             (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or
                  agency).

         (c)  Monthly Personal bank statements  corresponding  to  the  same
         period as the pay slips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the  salary
         has been paid into an account in the name  of  the  person  or  the
         name of the person and their partner jointly".

19. The Entry Clearance Officer specifically stated that the appellant  had
    not provided specified documents as evidence  of  the  sponsor's  gross
    income, for example "a letter from  his  employer  containing  all  the
    specified information, such as confirmation as to  the  nature  of  the
    sponsor's employment (whether a permanent contract) and  further  noted
    that the letter was not on company headed paper and the sum quoted  for
    the sponsor's gross annual income was  inconsistent  with  the  monthly
    gross salary shown on the wage slips submitted.

20. As pointed out in the hearing before me by Mr Singer the letter was not
    required to be on company headed paper and this is not a requirement of
    the Regulations.  I dismiss this objection.

21. The judge at paragraph  14  stated  that  she  found  that  the  letter
    provided by the husband's employer dated 4 February 2013  confirmed  he
    worked on a full-time basis as supervisor at Kingsway Store Londis  and
    that his annual gross salary was �20,800.  It also  explained  that  he
    had been employed on a part-time basis from 3  May  2006  until  August
    2010 when he was employed on a full-time  basis  and  when  his  annual
    gross salary was increased to �20,800.  The  judge  accepted  that  the
    appellant's husband was working under a contract of employment and that
    his gross annual salary was �20,800.  This however did not address  the
    type of employment of the appellant such as whether the employment  was
    permanent or temporary and although it might  be  inferred  this  is  a
    specific  requirement  and  this  letter  did  not  comply   with   the
    Immigration Rules.

22. The Entry Clearance Officer also took issue with the fact that the bank
    statements covered the period 7 June 2012 to 8 January  2013  only  and
    that none of the net salary figures  on  the  payslips  submitted  were
    reflected in  the  bank  statements  submitted.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer submitted that there were not deposits to  the  account  around
    the dates shown on the wage slips  broadly  consistent  with  the  sums
    detailed on the wage slips.  At paragraph 13 the judge found  that  the
    appellant had submitted six months' work payslips which were dated from
    16 June 2012 to 3 November 2012 and she found that the appellant had in
    fact submitted an application dated 13 February 2013.  This was a point
    challenged by the respondent.  It was pointed out  in  the  application
    for permission to appeal that the wage slips should cover the period to
    the date of the application.

23. At paragraph 13 the judge also found that there were  further  payslips
    and she could not  take  them  into  account.   However  the  appellant
    sponsor gave evidence that in fact  although  the  judge  recorded  the
    application was made on 13 February 2013  his  wife  did  not  in  fact
    attend and the payment was not made for  the  application  until  March
    2013.  The judge does not address this issue and I find that the  rules
    are clear that the wage slips should be  produced  for  the  six  month
    period prior to the application  and  they  were  not.   Even  by  13th
    February 2013 the documentation was out of date.

24. Another aspect in issue was Appendix FM-SE, paragraph 2(c) which states
    "personal bank statements corresponding  to  the  same  period  as  the
    payslips at paragraph 2(a) showing that the salary has been taken  into
    an account in the name of the person or in the name of the  person  and
    their partner jointly."  The judge made a finding at  paragraph  15  in
    the following terms:

         "15.  There  were  also  a  number  of  bank  statements  for   the
             Appellant's husband's account with Lloyds  TSB.   The  Sponsor
             explained in his witness statement that he was  paid  in  cash
             and only paid some of his income into  his  bank  account  and
             that he did not do so  on  the  same  date  every  month.   In
             addition, he explained that his employer deducted his rent  of
             �450 from the cash he paid him each month.  The fact  that  he
             was renting his room from his  employer  was  confirmed  in  a
             tenancy agreement, dated 11th October 2011.  He explained that
             there was no standing order for this rent,  even  though  this
             was required in the agreement.  He said that this was  because
             initially Joshua Alcasas was also renting a room in  the  flat
             and his rent of �325 was paid to the Sponsor as  part  of  his
             income.  This arrangement was confirmed in  a  further  letter
             from Mr. Pushparajah, dated 16th July 2014, in which  he  said
             that this arrangement was in force between 16th July 2012  and
             January 2013.  Taking this and the totality  of  the  evidence
             and applying a  balance  of  probabilities  I  find  that  the
             Appellant had  met  the  necessary  financial  and  evidential
             requirements as a spouse.

25. What is required under paragraph 2(c) is that personal bank  statements
    are provided corresponding to the same periods as the  payslips.   Does
    this require that exactly the same amount from the payslips  should  be
    paid into the bank statements and does this require that  the  employer
    directly transfers money to the employee's account?   The  question  is
    what does "the" refer to in terms of the salary.  Does  this  mean  the
    whole salary or does it mean part of the salary?  The Immigration Rules
    allow for cash to be paid into the account  and  which  would  indicate
    that there is some leniency. However, even if only part of  the  salary
    could be included, I note at paragraph 1(m) only cash income  on  which
    the correct tax has been paid may  be  counted  as  income  under  this
    Appendix subject  to  the  relevant  evidential  requirements  of  this
    Appendix.  The evidence given was that the sponsor received  a  benefit
    from his employer by way of rent and thus the exact sum  was  not  paid
    into his account. There was no confirmation from the HMRC as to whether
    tax was paid on this 'benefit'. Therefore in accordance with the  rules
    only the net amount paid into the account could be taken  into  account
    and this did not fulfil the financial requirements.

26. Mr Singer referred me to Appendix FM(D)(b)(i)(dd) which states that  if
    an applicant has submitted a document which does not contain all of the
    specified information then the decision maker may contact the applicant
    or his representative in writing.   The  appellant  did  in  fact  make
    contact with the Entry Clearance Officer indicating  that  her  husband
    was paid in cash.  I am not persuaded that the appellant's  sponsor  is
    precluded from being paid in cash or that it is a requirement  for  him
    to have a bank account which on the reading of the Immigration Rules as
    the respondent wishes me to read it would be a requirement.

27. Nonetheless I find that even if the Entry Clearance Officer might  have
    made a  request  under  the  Immigration  Rules  this  would  not  have
    assisted. It is not for the ECO to request information confirming  what
    tax was in fact paid. Indeed the visa application form completed by the
    appellant states that the sponsor was paid  '�400  a  week'  [5.1]  and
    makes no mention, at this stage, particularly in the application to the
    ECO, of a deduction for rent.  I note the P60 for the tax  year  ending
    2013 but this was produced by  the  employer  and  not  an  independent
    document produced by the HMRC.  There was HMRC documentation  available
    for the year 2013 to 2014 but not 2012 to 2013.

28. For the reasons given above namely the defects in the employer's letter
    and the difficulties with the financial evidence provided  relating  to
    the salary, such that the salary deposits in the bank account were  not
    consistent with the wage slips and that the  correct  income  had  been
    paid on the income.  Finally, paragraph 1 (l) of Appendix  FM  requires
    that

         'where this Appendix requires the applicant to  provided  specified
         evidence  relating  to  a  period  which  ends  with  the  date  of
         application, that evidence, or the most recently dated part of  it,
         must  be  dated  no  earlier  than  28  days  before  the  date  of
         application'.

    Even if the application was made on 13th February 2013, the judge found
    that the wage slips ended on 3rd November 2012.

29. For the reasons given above I find that the Judge  did  not  apply  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules correctly,  that  there
    was an error of law and remaking the decision the appellant  could  not
    fulfil the requirements of the Immigration Rules. Bearing in  mind  the
    variety of defects in the evidence provided with the application  I  do
    not find that the paragraph D(b)(i)(dd)  would  assist  the  appellant,
    that is that the ECO should call for 'a document which does not contain
    all of the specified information'.

30. I turn to the question of whether there is an Article 8 claim  in  this
    matter outside the Immigration Rules.  It was conceded by Mr Tufan that
    there was a genuine and subsisting  relationship  and  I  preserve  the
    findings of Judge Finch with  respect  to  the  accommodation  and  the
    English language test which were not challenged  by  the  Secretary  of
    State.

31. In view of her failure under the Immigration Rules  I  have  considered
    the matter with reference to in  Razgar  v  SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27.   I
    acknowledge case law which considers that there is either an Article  8
    case or not  and  the  Immigration  Rules  cannot  displace  Strasbourg
    jurisprudence.  I can accept  that  the  appellant  has  established  a
    family life as it was accepted that the relationship  was  genuine  and
    subsisting.  Clearly by  preventing  the  appellant  from  joining  her
    spouse there are consequences of such gravity as to cause  interference
    with family life.  I find that there the  decision  was  in  accordance
    with the law.

32. Once there is an interference with family or private life, the decision
    maker must justify  that  interference.   Hayat  (Nature  of  Chikwamba
    principle) Pakistan [2012] Civ 1054 at paragraph 18 confirmed:

    "It may at first blush seem odd that Article 8 rights may be  infringed
    by an unjustified insistence that the applicant should return  home  to
    make the application, even though a subsequent decision to  refuse  the
    application on the merits will not. The reason is that once there is an
    interference with family or  private  life,  the  decision  maker  must
    justify that interference. Where what is relied upon is  an  insistence
    on complying with formal procedures that may be insufficient to justify
    even a temporary  disruption  to  family  life.  By  contrast,  a  full
    consideration of the merits may readily identify features which justify
    a refusal to grant leave to remain".

33. I note however the decision of Patel and ors  v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72
   1. 'Although the context of the rules may be relevant to the
      consideration of proportionality, I agree with Burnton LJ that this
      cannot be equated with a formalised "near-miss" or "sliding scale"
      principle, as argued for by Mr Malik. That approach is unsupported by
      Strasbourg authority, or by a proper reading of Lord Bingham's words.
      Mrs Huang's case for favourable treatment outside the rules did not
      turn on how close she had come to compliance with rule 317, but on the
      application of the family values which underlie that rule and are at
      the heart also of article 8. Conversely, a near-miss under the rules
      cannot provide substance to a human rights case which is otherwise
      lacking in merit'.
   Further

    'It is important to remember that article 8 is not a general dispensing
power'

34. The sponsor is a British citizen who is integrated in society  here.  I
    take into account the impact on the partner of the appellant's removal,
    following Beoku Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39, nonetheless  I  find  that
    the status quo will be preserved. The appellant and sponsor  knew  when
    marrying that they would have  to  go  through  the  process  of  entry
    clearance.  At paragraph 100 of MM Lebanon & Ors v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ
    985 the court confirmed that the ECtHR had  repeatedly  recognised  the
    general right of states to control the  entry  and  residence  of  non-
    nationals and 'repeatedly acknowledged that the Convention  confers  no
    right on individuals or families to choose where they prefer to live'

35. I have also considered whether the  appellant  should  be  expected  to
    return to make an entry clearance application.

36. I take into account that the appellant made an application over a  year
    and half ago  but  Chikwamba  v  SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  40  accepted  that
    maintaining immigration control for the protection of  the  rights  and
    freedoms of others was  a  legitimate  aim  and  not  objectionable  in
    itself.  In that case the court referred to those having to  leave  the
    United Kingdom in order to make an application from abroad,  stating
   1. Now I would certainly not say that such an objective is in itself
      necessarily objectionable. Sometimes, I accept, it will be reasonable
      and proportionate to take that course. Indeed, Ekinci still seems to
      me just such a case. The appellant's immigration history was appalling
      and he was being required to travel no further than to Germany and to
      wait for no longer than a month for a decision on his application.
      Other obviously relevant considerations will be whether, for example,
      the applicant has arrived in this country illegally (say, concealed in
      the back of a lorry) for good reason or ill. To advance a genuine
      asylum claim would, of course, be a good reason. To enrol as a student
      would not. Also relevant would be for how long the Secretary of State
      has delayed in dealing with the case-see in this regard EB (Kosovo) v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 41. In an
      article 8 family case the prospective length and degree of family
      disruption involved in going abroad for an entry clearance certificate
      will always be highly relevant'.
   Further

    'Rather it seems to me that only  comparatively  rarely,  certainly  in
    family  cases  involving  children,  should  an  article  8  appeal  be
    dismissed on  the  basis  that  it  would  be  proportionate  and  more
    appropriate for the appellant to apply for leave from abroad.

37. I can  accept  that  this  principle  can  apply  to  families  without
    children, which is the position here, and that the appellant claimed to
    live as a refugee in India but I note she had continued to do so  since
    2009.  There was no evidence that the appellant was being returned to a
    place or living in a place of poor  conditions  such  as  the  case  in
    Chikwamba.  The status quo can effectively  be  maintained  whilst  the
    appellant makes a further application. I am not  persuaded  that  there
    was evidence of such delay on the part of the  Secretary  of  State  in
    dealing with an application.

38. The rules are indicative of the balance to be struck and at the date of
    the decision the appellant  could  not  comply  with  the  rules.   The
    question was raised by Mr Singer was that by  the  date  of  the  ECO's
    decision the appellant could comply with  the  financial  requirements.
    The level of income was indicated by the HMRC documentation. There  was
    indeed HM Revenue and Customs annual tax summary  dated  2013  to  2014
    produced indicating that for the financial year in which  the  decision
    of the Entry Clearance Officer was made the appellant did  indeed  earn
    �20,800 although there is a requirement  to  show  that  from  the  six
    months preceding the application

39. Indeed although there was an indication that  the  sponsor  now  earned
    above the required level I am not satisfied that  the  requirements  as
    set out in the Immigration Rules had been fully complied  with.   There
    are  specific  financial  requirements  to  be  satisfied   under   the
    Immigration Rules and I have highlighted the deficiencies above.  It is
    not merely  the  case  that  the  appellant  has  shown  that  all  the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules  have  been  met  save  for  the
    bureaucratic requirement of  entry  clearance.   In  addition  for  the
    purposes of Article 8 the date for my decision is 30th May  2013.   The
    bank statements of the sponsor produced which were closest to this date
    ended on 10th December 2012 and showed that the sponsor had  a  deficit
    in his Lloyds TSB account of �2,684.51.  There was reference to a later
    balance as I  note  below  but  this  was  not  supported  by  detailed
    statements and was a snapshot of one date on 9th January 2013.

40. I am enjoined by Section 117B (3) to consider the public interest   and
    to take into account  that  It  is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in
    particular in the interests of the economic well-being  of  the  United
    Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
    are financially independent, because such persons-
    (a)are not a burden on taxpayers, and  (b) are better able to integrate
into society.


41. Although the sponsor produced HMRC information to show at  the  end  of
    the tax year (2012-2014) in which the date of the ECO decision fell, he
    was earning above the level specified by the Immigration Rules for  the
    entry of a spouse, he nonetheless produced no bank statement as at  the
    date of the decision itself was considerably overdrawn (over 10% of his
    claimed income) and had been so since September 2012 ato 11th  December
    2012 although the balance on 9th January 2013 was recorded as  �286.72.
    This does not persuade me that at the relevant date the appellant would
    be financially independent.  She claimed that she had jewellery but  no
    specific or independent valuation was produced.

42. Taking all of the considerations above into account, I have  considered
    the appellant's right to a family and private life and have  considered
    the matter with reference to Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11  and  whether
    the decision

         'prejudices  the  family  life  of  the  applicant  in   a   manner
         sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental right
         protected by article 8'

    and I find that it does not.  It is open to the appellant to renew  her
    application from abroad and in the meantime  the  couple  can  continue
    their relationship as they have done since 2012 to date.

43. For the reasons given above I find an error of law in the  decision  of
    Judge Finch and set it aside but preserve the findings with respect  to
    paragraphs 16 and 17 which were not challenged.  I remake the  decision
    and find that the appellant cannot fulfil the financial requirements of
    the Immigration Rules and I dismiss the appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on Article 8 grounds.
