For the Appellant:     Mr A Shajko, of Visa & Immigration UK Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The Appellant is a national of Kosovo, born on 29 November 1982.  His
       appeal against a refusal of entry clearance dated 24 April  2014,  as
       the partner of Ms S. Potter (the sponsor),  a  British  citizen,  was
       allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lebasci (the Judge) in  a
       determination promulgated on 12 March 2015. The  Respondent  appealed
       to the Upper Tribunal against that decision on  the  basis  that  the
       Judge failed to consider or apply provisions of the immigration rules
       (paragraph  1(n)  of  Appendix  FM-SE)  dealing  with  cash  deposits
       identified in the sponsor's bank account statements.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted and I heard the Respondents'  appeal
       on 09 July 2015. In a determination promulgated on  15  July  2015  I
       found that the First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in  law  by
       failing to consider the financial evidence relating to the  sponsor's
       income within the framework of the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE
       1(m) and (n). While there were a number of large  deposits  into  the
       sponsor's bank account statements during the relevant period prior to
       the date of the application these  did  not  correspond  to  her  net
       income as disclosed in her salary slips as required by  Appendix  FM-
       SE(1)(n).

    3. I additionally found that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in  law
       by taking account of the sponsor's premium bonds, which where to  the
       value of �10,000, when assessing whether she had 'specified'  savings
       for the purpose of Appendix FM and paragraph 11A of  Appendix  FM-SE.
       The bonds could only be taken into account if they were cashed-in  to
       provide savings. Nor, in the alternative, had any consideration  been
       given by the First-tier Tribunal to the fact that the sponsor had not
       met the documentary requirements relating to any income she  received
       from the bonds held (she had produced no portfolio report or dividend
       voucher). In these  circumstances  I  was  satisfied  the  First-tier
       Tribunal materially erred in law and that  the  Appellant  could  not
       succeed in his entry  clearance  application  under  the  immigration
       rules.

    4. Mindful of the fact that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  not  gone
       on  to  consider  whether  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance   could
       constitute a disproportionate interference  with  Article  8  ECHR  I
       adjourned the hearing to  enable  further  evidence,  both  oral  and
       documentary, to be provided in this regard.

Further evidence

    5. The  Appellant  provided  a  further  bundle  of  documents  for  the
       adjourned hearing on 03 September 2015. Much of this  evidence  post-
       dated both the Respondent's decision under appeal  and  the  previous
       appeal hearings. The additional documentary evidence included,  inter
       alia, P60s for the year ending April 2015 relating to  the  sponsor's
       employment with both Hart Stores & Costessey Post Office and West End
       Cue Club, further wage slips relating to these two jobs, further bank
       account statements, further  evidence  of  the  sponsor's  visits  to
       Kosovo, and birth certificates relating to the  sponsor's  two  adult
       children.  I  additionally  received  skeleton  arguments  from  both
       representatives.

Oral evidence form the sponsor

    6. The sponsor adopted her earlier statement of 19 January 2015. In this
       statement the sponsor reiterated the genuineness of her  relationship
       with the  Appellant,  a  matter  no  longer  in  issue.  The  sponsor
       additionally identified  the  financial  documents  provided  to  the
       Respondent relating to her employment, her savings, her bonds and her
       mortgage.

    7. In her oral evidence the sponsor explained that she now deposited her
       cash income straight into her bank account and this was reflected  in
       her new bank account statements. As this early juncture  I  indicated
       to Mr Shajko that,  pursuant  to  section  85A  of  the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and following  the  House  of  Lords
       decision in AS (Somalia) (FC) and another (Appellants) v Secretary of
       State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2009] UKHL  32,  I  could
       only consider evidence appertaining to circumstances at the  date  of
       the refusal of entry clearance, which was 24 April 2014.  Mr  Shajko,
       in reply, submitted that the amount of money received by the  sponsor
       at the date of decision was exactly the same as that reflected in the
       post-decision evidence, the  only  difference  being  that  the  full
       income was now deposited into her bank account statements,  and  that
       she had now 'cashed-in' her bonds.

    8. The sponsor stated that both her sons lived in Norwich and  that  she
       was very close to them. She was also close to  her  mother,  who  had
       recently been hospitalised and who would be staying with the  sponsor
       upon her discharge.   She  did  not  want  to  leave  her  mother  or
       children. She had also previously lost a baby daughter. She could not
       move to Kosovo because she had two jobs and a home. There was no work
       for the Appellant in Kosovo, let alone for  the  sponsor.  She  could
       only speak the odd word of Albanian. The separation from her  husband
       was  affecting  her  emotionally  and  she  now  felt  she  had  done
       everything that was required of her.

    9. In cross-examination the sponsor said she was not sure how  long  the
       Appellant had lived in the United Kingdom prior to meeting  him.  She
       did not at first know that he  was  present  in  the  United  Kingdom
       illegally but she became aware  of  this  before  they  married.  She
       thought that her youngest son may have lived with her at the date  of
       decision because he had split up  with  his  girlfriend  around  that
       time.

   10. In response to questions from me the sponsor said her sons were  both
       in employment at the date of the Respondent's decision and that  they
       were neither dependent nor  reliant  on  her.  At  the  date  of  the
       Respondent's decision her mother was in good  health.  The  sponsor's
       mother lived by herself in a normal residence  about  6  or  7  miles
       away. The Appellant had his parents in Kosovo, two married sisters, a
       brother, nephews, aunts and uncles and cousins. The sponsor had twice
       been to Kosovo this year and four times  previously.  In  Kosovo  she
       stayed in her in-law's home.

Submissions

   11. Both representatives relied on their skeleton  arguments.  Mr  Jarvis
       submitted that the documentary requirements in  Appendix  FM-SE  were
       set within specific time lines and that I was not  entitled  to  take
       account of financial  evidence  outside  the  requisite  periods.  He
       submitted that the application under the immigration rules was doomed
       to failure and queried why no further application had  been  made  in
       the meantime. He referred me to the authority of  SS  (Congo)  [2015]
       EWCA Civ 387 and submitted that the failure of the Appellant to  meet
       the financial requirements by  �1,200  was  not  a  'near-miss'.  The
       sponsor's British nationality, her life long residence in the  United
       Kingdom and her job could not amount to insurmountable obstacles. The
       relationship was formed when the Appellant's immigration  status  was
       precarious.

   12. Mr Shajko took issue with the requirement in the immigration rules to
       meet have an income of �18,600. He pointed out that the sponsor spent
       very  little  on  her  mortgage  and  could  afford  to  support  the
       Appellant. He referred to the fact that the premium  bonds  were  now
       cashed-in. He took issue with the failure of the immigration rules to
       designate premium bonds as specified savings. He submitted  that  the
       P60s for the year ending April 2014 showed only a  �1,200  difference
       between the sponsor's income and  the  requirements  of  Appendix-FM.
       This was sufficient to amount to  a  'near  miss'.  The  sponsor  had
       experienced a lot of hassle and the  appellant's  circumstances  were
       'exceptional within the terms of SS (Congo). She had  lived  all  her
       life in the United Kingdom, had jobs here, her extended  family,  and
       owned property.

   13. I indicated that I would reserve my decision.

Discussion

   14. The sponsor  has  produced  a  significant  amount  of  new  evidence
       relating to her income, which I have outlined at paragraph 5 of  this
       decision. As I had indicated to Mr Shajko, pursuant to section 85A of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  and  the  House  of
       Lords decision in AS (Somalia) I  am  simply  not  entitled  to  take
       account of this new evidence. Although the new  documentary  evidence
       may  indicate  that  the  Appellant  does  now  meet  the   financial
       requirements of Appendix  FM  and  Appendix  FM-SE  (and  I  make  no
       specific finding on the point) the fact remains that, at the date  of
       decision (24 April 2014), he  did  not  meet  those  requirements.  I
       cannot  take  the  new  financial  evidence  into   account   in   my
       consideration of the compliance of the  refusal  of  entry  clearance
       with Article 8.

   15. Adopting the 5 step approach in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 I am  satisfied
       there is family life between the Appellant and the sponsor  and  that
       the interference with that  family  life  by  the  refusal  of  entry
       clearance is of sufficient severity  to  attract  the  protection  of
       Article  8.  Having  found  that  the  Appellant  cannot   meet   the
       requirements of the immigration rules I am satisfied the decision  is
       lawful. I am further satisfied that the decision is in pursuit  of  a
       legitimate aim (the economic well-being of the United Kingdom and the
       rights and freedoms of others, as protected by immigration  control).
       The remaining issue for my determination is that of proportionality.

   16. Following a long line of authorities, including R (Nagre) v Secretary
       of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC  720  (Admin),  Singh  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015]  EWCA  Civ  74  and
       SSHD v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387, in order for the Appellant  to
       succeed in his application for leave to enter outside the immigration
       rules pursuant to Article 8, I must be satisfied there are compelling
       circumstances not sufficiently recognised under those rules.  As  was
       stated in paragraph 44 of SS  (Congo),  "If  there  is  a  reasonably
       arguable case under Article 8 which has not already been sufficiently
       dealt with by consideration of the application under the  substantive
       provisions of the Rules (cf Nagre, para. [30]), then  in  considering
       that case the individual interests of the applicant and others  whose
       Article 8 rights are in issue should be balanced against  the  public
       interest, including as expressed in the Rules, in order  to  make  an
       assessment whether refusal to grant LTR or LTE, as the case  may  be,
       is disproportionate and hence unlawful by virtue of section  6(1)  of
       the HRA read with Article  8."  This  is  a  fairly  demanding  test,
       reflecting the reasonable relationship between the  rules  themselves
       and the proper outcome of the application of Article 8 in  the  usual
       run of cases (paragraph 44 of SS (Congo)). It is  therefore  apparent
       that, in assessing the proportionality of the decision, I  must  look
       at the circumstances of the Appellant and  his  sponsor  through  the
       prism or lens of the Immigration Rules, which have not been met.

   17. As I have set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  have
       embarked on  remaking  that  decision,  pursuant  to  YM  (Uganda)  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ  1292  (at
       paragraph 38) I am obliged to consider paragraphs 117A to  D  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  when  assessing  the
       proportionality of the decision to refuse entry clearance.

   18. I  note,  pursuant  to  section  117B(1),  that  the  maintenance  of
       effective immigration control is  in  the  public  interest.  Section
       117B(2)  indicates  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in
       particular the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  the
       Appellant is able to speak English. I note the Appellant has obtained
       an ESOL Entry 1 is Speaking and Listening. It is in the  same  public
       interest that the Appellant is financially independent. There  is  no
       evidence of any skills  or  qualifications  that  the  Appellant  may
       possess. I note that the sponsor is employed in two jobs but, at  the
       date of the decision, she did not earn �18,600  as  required  by  the
       immigration rules. I do note however that she had �10,000 in  premium
       bonds. The necessary documentation to  prove  an  income  from  these
       bonds were not however provided.  I further note that in AM (S  117B)
       Malawi [2015] UKUT  0260  (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that  an
       appellant can obtain no positive right to a grant of leave to  remain
       from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever the degree of his  fluency  in
       English, or the strength of his financial resources.

   19. Section 117B(4) indicates that little weight should  be  given  to  a
       relationship formed with a qualifying partner (such as  the  sponsor)
       if the relationship was established when the  Appellant  was  in  the
       United Kingdom unlawfully. It was not disputed that the Appellant was
       in the United Kingdom  unlawfully  when  his  relationship  with  the
       sponsor was formed. I must therefore attach  little  weight  to  that
       relationship.

   20. The existence of any 'insurmountable obstacles' is  a  factor  to  be
       taken into account in the  broader  Article  8  assessment.  In  this
       regard I note that the sponsor has two jobs in  the  United  Kingdom,
       and that she owns (mortgaged)  property  in  the  United  Kingdom.  I
       additionally note that she is British, that  she  was  born  in  this
       country and has always lived here. I additionally note that  she  can
       speak only the 'odd word' of Albanian. However, in Agyarko &  Ors,  R
       (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
       [2015] EWCA Civ 440 the Court of Appeal held that it was not unlawful
       for the Secretary of State for the Home Department to hold there were
       no insurmountable obstacles to the appellants in that case, who  were
       British citizens, had lived all their lives in the United Kingdom and
       had jobs here, to relocate. Although they might find it difficult and
       might be  reluctant  to  do  so  these  factors  did  not  amount  to
       insurmountable obstacles. I further note that the sponsor appears  to
       have had a significant amount of equity in  her  property  and  which
       could be used to support both her and the Appellant should she choose
       to relocate to Kosovo, and that they would have available to  them  a
       network of family support from the Appellant's  family,  the  sponsor
       having already stayed in with her in-laws when visiting  Kosovo.  The
       Appellant is clearly fluent in Albanian and could assist the  sponsor
       in  communicating  until  she  reached   a   reasonable   degree   of
       proficiency.

   21. I accept that the sponsor has a good relationship with her  two  sons
       and that they live nearby. I additionally accept that the sponsor has
       a good relationship with her mother. Following the authority of Singh
       v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ  630
       I note that there is no  legal  or  factual  presumption  as  to  the
       existence or absence of family life for  the  purpose  of  Article  8
       between adult children and their  parents.  It  all  depends  on  the
       particular facts. The love and affection between  an  adult  and  his
       parents will not of itself justify a finding of  family  life.  There
       has to be something more. The sponsor's evidence  was  that,  at  the
       date of the Respondent's decision, her children were both adults, and
       working, and at least one of them was living separately. The  sponsor
       indicated that her sons were not dependent or reliant upon  her.  The
       sponsor further indicated that, at the  date  of  the  decision,  her
       mother was living alone, some 6 or 7 miles  away,  and  was  in  good
       health. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that, at  the  date
       of the decision, the relationships the sponsor had with her family in
       the United Kingdom was sufficient to  render  the  refusal  of  entry
       clearance disproportionate. I  additionally  find  that  the  sponsor
       could maintain contact  with  her  family  through  remote  forms  of
       communication and through periodic visits. I note  that  she  lost  a
       baby daughter but there does not appear to be anything preventing her
       from visiting the place where her daughter rests if based in Kosovo.

   22. I have considered the Appellant's financial circumstances,  including
       her stated income from the P60s as of the date of  the  decision  and
       the funds  she  held  as  premium  bonds.  I  am  not  satisfied  the
       difference of �1,200 between the income disclosed in the P60s and the
       required amount of �18,600 is such as to render the failure  to  meet
       the financial  requirements  a  'near  miss'.  The  difference  is  a
       significant amount. Nor am I entitled to take into account the  post-
       decision evidence that the sponsor  has  now  cashed-in  her  premium
       bonds.

   23. Having holistic regard to  the  aforementioned  factors,  and  having
       regard to the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed  by  the  state  in
       determining the conditions for leave to enter through  the  exclusion
       of EX.1 as a basis for  the  grant  of  entry  clearance,  I  am  not
       satisfied there exist compelling reasons relating  to  the  Appellant
       and the sponsor such as to require the grant of entry clearance under
       Article 8 ECHR.

  Decision

  The appeal is dismissed
