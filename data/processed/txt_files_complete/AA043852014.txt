For the Respondent/Claimant:    Miss Kyakwita, Legal Representative,
                           Immigration Practitioner Service


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing the claimant's appeal against the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  to  recognise  her  as  a
    refugee, but allowing on Article  8  grounds  her  appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's concomitant decision to remove her  under  Section
    10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The First-tier Tribunal did
    not make an anonymity order, and I do not consider that such  an  order
    is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

2.   The claimant is a national  of  Uganda,  whose  date  of  birth  is  13
    January 1982.  She entered the United Kingdom on 8 August 2008  with  a
    visit visa that was valid from 31 July 2008 until 31 January 2009.  She
    did not leave the  UK  before  this  visa  expired,  and  she  made  no
    application to extend her leave to remain or otherwise  regularise  her
    stay in the UK until she claimed  asylum  on  10  November  2011.   Her
    asylum claim was refused on 10 June 2014, and a decision to remove  her
    as a person subject to administrative removal was  served  on  17  June
    2014.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

3.   The claimant's appeal came before Judge Geraint  Jones  QC  sitting  at
    Hatton Cross in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  4  August  2014.   Miss
    Kyakwita appeared on behalf of the claimant.  The judge  received  oral
    evidence from the claimant and also from  the  claimant's  partner,  Mr
    Edwin Asafu-Adjaye.  He said he had met the claimant  in  October  2012
    and he described how their relationship had blossomed  thereafter  with
    them starting to live  together  in  April  2013.   He  was  a  British
    citizen, and he would not want to go and  live  with  the  claimant  in
    Uganda.  He also would not take his daughter by the claimant to  reside
    in that country.

4.   The judge went on to dismiss the appeal against the refusal of  asylum,
    but to allow the claimant's appeal on Article 8 grounds.  He found that
    the claimant had maximised her position by having a child by a  British
    citizen father, so that the child was also a British citizen.  Although
    the claimant would be gaining her desired outcome because she had given
    birth to a child fathered by a British citizen, the burden of authority
    was presently in favour of allowing such immigration tactics to prevail
    in favour of those who deployed  them.   He  referred  to  ZH  Tanzania
    [2011] UKSC 4. That line of authority, which  gave  precedence  to  the
    interests of children, prevailed in  this  appeal  by  driving  him  to
    conclude that it would be disproportionate to require the  claimant  to
    depart the United Kingdom.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

5.   The Secretary of State applied for  permission  to  appeal,  submitting
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had misdirected himself  by  failing
    to apply the correct approach to  Article  8  as  set  out  in  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct  approach)  UKUT  640.   Head  note  B
    stated as follows:

         "After applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may be
         arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them  is
         it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to  consider  whether
         there are compelling circumstance is  not  sufficiently  recognised
         under them; R (on the application of) Nagre v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).

6.   The judge had not applied the Immigration Rules at all to  any  of  the
    findings made in respect of the Article 8 claim.   The  judge  had  not
    followed the correct approach in deciding if the claimant  met  or  did
    not meet  the  Immigration  Rules;  and  if  the  latter,  whether  the
    claimant's circumstances were compelling  enough  that  they  were  not
    sufficiently recognised under them.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

7.   On 28 August 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes  granted  permission
    to appeal for the following reasons:

         "The judge appears to have considered Article 8  without  reference
         to the relevant Immigration Rules or the financial ability  of  the
         child's father to support the [claimant].  The grounds are  clearly
         arguable and permission to appeal is granted."

The Error Law Hearing on 17 October 2014

8.   After receiving submissions from both parties, I ruled  that  an  error
    of law was made out. My reasons for so finding are set out below.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

9.   The difficulty faced by the judge below was that Miss Kyakwita had  not
    sought to make out a case under Appendix FM,  and  only  relied  on  an
    Article 8 claim outside the Rules.  Nonetheless, the  judge  needed  to
    follow the approach set out in Gulshan.  Failure to do  so  means  that
    his decision on the Article 8 claim is vitiated by a material error  of
    law such that it has to be set aside and remade.  By not following  the
    two stage approach set out in Gulshan, the judge has engaged in a  free
    wheeling Article 8 assessment which has not been permissible since  the
    introduction in July 2012 of the  new  Rules  relating  to  family  and
    private life claims.

10.  While the judge may ultimately be proved right  in  his  conclusion  on
    Article 8,  he  has  not  given  adequate  reasons  for  reaching  that
    conclusion.  One of the functions of a determination is to  inform  the
    losing party why he/she has lost, and the  failure  to  follow  Gulshan
    means that this  function  has  not  been  discharged  so  far  as  the
    Secretary of State is concerned.

The Resumed Hearing on 5 December 2014

11.  At the resumed hearing, Miss Kyakwita relied on a supplementary  bundle
    of documents in addition to the  bundle  of  documents  that  had  been
    placed before the First-tier Tribunal.  In her skeleton  argument,  she
    submitted the basic facts were not in dispute.  The  appellant's  child
    and partner were both British citizens.  They all lived together  as  a
    family.  The appellant had started living with  her  partner  in  April
    2013.  He worked full-time as a bus driver, and his  P60  for  the  tax
    year ended April 2014 showed that  he  earned  more  than  ï¿½42,000  per
    annum.  The claimant came within the scope  of  EX.1.   She  was  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a child, who was under the age
    of 18, was in the UK, and was a British citizen.  The  child  had  been
    born on 12 October 2013,  and  she  was  still  being  breastfed.   The
    claimant's partner worked full-time as a bus driver, and all his shifts
    were at night.  While he was at work, the  claimant  looked  after  the
    baby.  It would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the  UK
    with her mother.  Equally it would be reasonable to expect  the  mother
    to leave the UK without the child.  The father was  not  able  to  look
    after a child just over the age of 1 who  still  needed  breastfeeding,
    and  who  certainly  needed  her  mother.   There  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life with the partner continuing  outside  the  UK.
    Her partner was born here, and he had lived in the UK all his life.  He
    had never been to Uganda.

12.  In reply, Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  not  all  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE were met.  An employer's letter had not  been  provided.
    He accepted that it would not be reasonable to separate the child  from
    her mother, and he did not dispute that it  would  be  unreasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the UK.  But the  claimant  could  not  bring
    herself within EX.1 as she was not  eligible  for  consideration  under
    EX.1.

The Remaking of the Decision

13.  The claimant is not yet eligible for leave to remain under the  partner
    route in  Appendix  FM  as  Mr  Asafu-Adjaye  does  not  yet  meet  the
    definition of a partner given in GEN.1.2.  He is not a person  who  has
    been living together with the  applicant  in  a  relationship  akin  to
    marriage for at least two years.

14.  Although it is accepted by Mr  Bramble  that  the  claimant  meets  the
    exemption criteria contained in EX.1(a), he rightly  submits  that  the
    claimant is disqualified  from  relying  on  these  exemption  criteria
    because of the relationship requirements contained in E-LTRP.2.3.   She
    does not have sole responsibility for her British  citizen  child,  and
    the child does not normally live with her, rather than  with  both  her
    parents, one of whom is a British citizen.

15.  However, it is not disputed by Mr  Bramble  that  the  claimant  has  a
    viable claim outside the Rules, applying Gulshan.  I refer to the  five
    point Razgar test.  Questions 1 and 2 in the Razgar test  clearly  fall
    to be answered in the claimant's favour, as the removal of the claimant
    will split up a family.  Questions 3 and 4 of the Razgar test should be
    answered in favour of the SSHD, and so the crucial  issue  is  that  of
    proportionality.

16.  The claimant has a poor immigration history.  She  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on a visit visa on 8 August  2008,  and  overstayed  after  the
    expiry of her visa on 31 January 2009.  She did not seek to  regularise
    her status until she claimed asylum on 10 November  2011.   The  asylum
    claim was rejected by the Secretary of State on 10 June 2014, and Judge
    Geraint Jones QC found that her core account was false,  including  her
    claim to have been an active lesbian in Uganda.  However in her  favour
    is the fact that she speaks English and that, with the  support  of  Mr
    Asafu-Adjaye, she is financially independent.  The  main  and  decisive
    consideration in her favour under Section 117B of the 2002 Act is  that
    she has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  a  British
    citizen child, and it would not be reasonable to expect that  child  to
    leave the United Kingdom with her, as is  accepted  by  Mr  Bramble  on
    behalf of the  Secretary  of  State.   Accordingly,  I  find  that  the
    proposed removal of the claimant  is  disproportionate,  and  that  her
    Article 8 claim succeeds outside the Rules.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error  of  law  in  the
disposal of the claimant's Article 8 claim, and accordingly the decision  on
Article 8 is set aside  and  the  following  decision  is  substituted:  the
claimant's appeal against removal is allowed under Article 8 ECHR.
