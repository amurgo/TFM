                                                                  Respondent


                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh who appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against the decision of the respondent  of  25  September
    2013. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal in  a  determination
    promulgated on 13 April 2015. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Levin  granted
    the appellants permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By way of a letter dated 10  March  2015  the  appellants'  solicitor's
    state requested that it be treated as withdrawn by the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the respondent was the successful party  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the appellants'  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.
