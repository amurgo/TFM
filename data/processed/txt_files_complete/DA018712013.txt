                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This determination refers to parties  as  they  were  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

2) The  SSHD  appeals  against  a  determination  by  a  panel  of  the  FtT
   comprising Judge P A Grant-Hutchison and Mrs E Morton, promulgated  on  9
   December 2013.  The panel allowed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
   respondent's decision of 30 August 2013 to deport  him  to  Poland  under
   Regulation 19 of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
   2006.

3) The first substantial point raised in the SSHD's  grounds  of  appeal  to
   the UT is at paragraph 2:

    The FtT fails to grasp the seriousness of  the  appellant's  offending.
    It is perverse to refer to the  appellant  having  a  minimal  criminal
    record in the UK (paragraph 23) when that record includes a  conviction
    for the illegal supply of drug resulting in a 30 month prison sentence.


4) Paragraph  22  of  the  determination  quotes  the  Sheriff's  sentencing
   remarks, which refer to  the  courts  dealing  with  such  matters  "very
   seriously"; to the significant amount of illegal drugs involved,  and  to
   the fact that significant amounts  of  harm  and  significant  amount  of
   misery are caused thereby; and to the appellant  pleading  guilty  to  "2
   serious charges" regarding drugs "of significant value" [ï¿½63,000.00].

5) Ms Speirs pointed out that the respondent's  decision  was  made  on  the
   basis that the appellant was involved in supply of Class A drugs, whereas
   the copy indictment which the  appellant  produced  showed  that  he  was
   involved in supplying Class B drugs only.  She accepted that this did not
   mean that the offence was less than serious.  She was unable  to  suggest
   how paragraph 22 could be reconciled with paragraph 23, where  the  panel
   says, "We accept that the appellant has a minimal criminal record in  the
   UK, although he has a more problematic conviction in Poland."

6) Paragraph 3 of the SSHD's grounds appeal to the UT says:

    The [panel] fails to give any reason for taking a lenient view  of  the
    appellant's offending in Poland,  described  in  paragraph  25  as  "an
    unfortunate one-off event".


7) Ms Speirs (who appeared also in the FtT) observed  that  the  appellant's
   conviction in Poland was known only because he disclosed it in course  of
   preparation of a criminal justice report and in  his  witness  statement.
   She explained that there had been both evidence and submissions going  to
   the nature of the offence in Poland.  However, she was unable to refer to
   any reasoning in the determination to  justify  its  description  of  the
   Polish offence.

8) I note that the appellant describes the Polish offence in  his  statement
   as a "minor assault", but it was sufficient for the Polish government  to
   extradite him and for the Polish court to impose a sentence of  2  years'
   imprisonment.  There is at paragraph 10(a) of the determination a  record
   of the appellant's evidence in cross-examination that he did not know the
   person he assaulted, and that he kept telling the authors of the criminal
   justice report that it was "a minor assault".  The only explanation to be
   drawn from the determination is that the  offence  was  to  be  minimised
   because the appellant  said  so.   That  is  a  point  which  might  more
   obviously have counted against him.

9) I cannot find reasoning in the determination to  explain  the  conclusion
   that the Polish conviction, which attracted a significant sentence, could
   effectively be written off.   Such  a  finding  may  have  been  tenable,
   although at first sight unlikely; but it  is  not  one  which  can  stand
   without an adequate explanation.

10) The fourth paragraph of the grounds of appeal is as follows:

    The judge erred in finding at paragraph 25  that  the  respondent  "has
    provided no evidence  of  how  the  appellant's  offence  represents  a
    sufficiently serious threat to British society  in  the  future".   The
    judge had evidence of  the  appellant's  record  of  offending  and  in
    particular his most recent drugs offence, the gravity of which was  not
    given adequate weight.


11) Mr Mullen submitted that the criminal justice report  disclosed  a  risk
   of re-offending, even if it was a low one, and that  the  nature  of  the
   appellant's offending  was  a  manifest  threat  to  society.   Ms  Friel
   submitted that the above was a passing observation open to the panel, and
   not a misconception about a legal test.

12) On the point arising from the fourth paragraph,  I  do  not  think  that
   either the determination or the ground of appeal  is  clearly  expressed.
   It might have been open to the  panel  to  conclude  that  there  was  no
   significant threat to the public.  I do not find it necessary to  analyse
   this any further, because of the errors disclosed at paragraphs 2  and  3
   of the grounds.

13) The grounds identify another error,  in  that  the  panel  purported  to
   allow the appeal "under the Immigration Rules".  The case did not involve
   the Immigration Rules,  but  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
   Regulations 2006.  That would have required correction, if  the  rest  of
   the determination was sound.

14) The determination reads rather as if something may have  gone  wrong  in
   its preparation, not picked up before it was  promulgated.   The  finding
   that  the  appellant's  UK  criminal  record  as   "minimal"   is   self-
   contradictory on its face, and not one properly open to any panel to have
   reached.   There is no sustainable explanation of why the Polish criminal
   record was thought to be an insignificant matter.  These  are  errors  of
   law, such that the determination has to be set  aside  in  its  entirety.
   The case is not of a nature whereby the Upper Tribunal could  proceed  to
   substitute a fresh decision, based upon the evidence which was before the
   FtT and upon submissions.  A fresh  judicial  fact  finding  exercise  is
   required, of a nature and extent such that under section  12(2)(b)(i)  of
   the 2007 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 it is appropriate  to  remit  the
   case to the First-tier Tribunal.  The members of the First-tier  Tribunal
   chosen to reconsider the case  are  not  to  include  Judge  P  A  Grant-
   Hutchison or Mrs Morton.
