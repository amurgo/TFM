                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This determination refers to parties as they  were  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. The ECO appeals against a determination by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Wallace, promulgated on 12th February 2014,  allowing  the  Appellant's
    appeal against refusal of entry clearance as a spouse.

 3. Grounds of  Appeal  (a)  and  (c)  are  directed  against  the  judge's
    conclusion that the marriage between the Appellant  and  Sponsor  is  a
    subsisting one in which they intend to live permanently together in the
    UK.  However, the grant of permission indicated that those grounds were
    not promising, and Mr Mullen (rightly, in my view) did not insist  upon
    them.

 4. Ground (b) is this:

         Looking at the Appellant's circumstances, it  appears  that  he  is
         unable to meet the maintenance requirements of  the  Rule  ...  the
         Sponsor was earning only �210  a  week  and  there  is  a  lack  of
         satisfactory documentary evidence to substantiate the  claimed  job
         offer.  The judge has  failed  to  properly  establish  why  it  is
         accepted that the maintenance requirements of the Rules are met.

 5. Mr Mullen submitted as follows.  The judge reached no properly reasoned
    conclusion that the Appellant would have such earnings as  to  maintain
    and accommodate the parties without  recourse  to  public  funds.   The
    Sponsor's income is from benefits [not earnings, as  suggested  by  the
    wording of the grounds], and any earnings of the Appellant would result
    in a corresponding reduction.  Without clear evidence of  the  earnings
    the Appellant was likely to have in the UK, it could not be shown  that
    he and the Sponsor and their three children would have an income  above
    the benefits level, which was something over �200 per week.  There  was
    evidence of possible employment but that post-dated the decision and so
    was irrelevant, and in any event it was not a specific  offer  and  did
    not specify the number of hours or the hourly rate.   It  was  accepted
    that there was evidence that while in the UK previously  the  Appellant
    worked 58 hours per week at �6.35 per hour.

 6. Mr Khan's submissions were these.  The items submitted by the Appellant
    to support his application to the ECO included  items  8  and  9  of  a
    schedule.  The schedule but not the items themselves were copied by the
    Respondent in the bundle provided  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    Appellant through his agents requested copies, but these had never been
    supplied, and the Appellant and Sponsor had  not  kept  copies  of  the
    originals.  That is shy new evidence of the job offer was put in.   The
    test was whether there would be additional recourse  to  public  funds.
    The judge gave adequate reasons for concluding that such would  not  be
    the case.  There were elements of third party support, even if only  of
    a helping and not of a legally obligatory  nature,  but  it  came  from
    close family members, and so could be relied upon.  The  Appellant  had
    shown ability to secure  a  job  because  he  had  a  good  history  of
    employment when in the UK, and he had presented an offer of  employment
    if he returned.  Even if the case  had  not  succeeded  on  maintenance
    grounds, it should have been allowed in terms of Article 8 of the ECHR,
    including the best interests of the two children in the UK, taken along
    with absence of any adverse immigration history, a subsisting marriage,
    and a network of family relationships.

 7. Mr Mullen in response said that he could  not  fairly  argue  that  the
    employer's letter indicating a possibility of future employment  should
    be left out of account, given that it appeared to be  the  Respondent's
    responsibility that the original evidence was not before the First-tier
    Tribunal.  He submitted that it was an offer too vague to  support  the
    judge's conclusion on maintenance.  As to Article 8, the Appellant  had
    not been bound to leave the UK (while estranged  from  his  wife).   He
    could have applied to remain here, or to return for  contact  with  the
    children.  The appeal should have been dismissed under the  Immigration
    Rules, and there was no basis for allowing it under the ECHR.

 8. I reserved my determination.

 9. The judge had to decide the issue of maintenance.  She rightly  thought
    that the offers of family financial support were genuine, but that they
    were not such as to enable the appeal to succeed on the basis of  third
    party support.  At paragraph 50 she gave her reasons  -  the  Appellant
    had received offers of employment, and he had been in  employment  when
    previously in the UK.  She was entitled to conclude that  it  was  more
    likely than not that he would secure similar employment if he returned.
     The figures relating to that past employment were enough to  take  the
    family above income support  levels.   The  judge's  reasoning  is  not
    detailed or elaborate, but it is sufficient to support  the  conclusion
    reached.

10. Whether there was enough in the case to succeed under Article 8 outwith
    the Immigration Rules is doubtful; but that is immaterial.

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
