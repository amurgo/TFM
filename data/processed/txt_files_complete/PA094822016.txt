                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a national of Iran, born in January 1995. He made a
       claim for protection on the basis he is Gay and was seen having sex
       with another man in his home country and fled out of fear. The
       respondent rejected his claim on the basis his account was not
       credible.

    2. His appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Hanlon at
       Bradford on 29 June 2018. In a decision promulgated on 17 July 2018
       the appeal was dismissed. The judge did not find his account to be
       credible.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
       judge failed to conduct a holistic assessment and focused upon
       specific incidents.it was arguable the judge did not adequately
       analyse the detailed statement from the appellant in which he set out
       his awareness of his sexuality.

The Upper Tribunal

    4. The central issue in the appeal was whether the appellant really was
       Gay as he claimed. He said he had two Gay relationships in Iran. The
       1st was with a schoolfriend, [V], who lived in the same street. He
       said they would go to his house and watch pornographic CDs and then
       have sex. He described how on one occasion they were very nearly
       caught when his grandmother came home unexpectedly. After that he
       began a relationship with Massoud. He claimed in November 2015 they
       were discovered naked and having sex in Massoud's family home whilst
       a Gay pornographic film was being shown. First-tier Tribunal Judge
       O'Hanlon did not find the incident with Massoud occurred and referred
       to the appellant's claim of an earlier incident with [V] as a reason
       for not believing the subsequent incident and the lack of precautions
       involved.

    5. The grounds contend that the judge did not give reasons for rejection
       of his account with [V] and that there was limited engagement with
       the claim about his homosexuality in Iran.

    6. Mr Tan accepts shortcomings in the decision about the claimed
       relationships in Iran. In light of this he did not oppose an error of
       law finding on this basis and the matter being remitted for a
       rehearing.

    7. Mr Wood had appeared for the appellant in the First-tier Tribunal. He
       submitted that there was no engagement by the judge with the
       appellant's detailed witness statement.

    8. The parties agree that this is a case where the decision of the First-
       tier tribunal must be set aside. No further written reasons are
       required. The requirements of subparagraph 40(3)(a) and (b) of the
       rules are met. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier
       Tribunal.

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Hanlon is set aside and the
matter remitted for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.


                    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly.
