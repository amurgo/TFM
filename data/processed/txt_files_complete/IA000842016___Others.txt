Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Z Malik, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW



 1. The appellants are citizens  of  Pakistan.  The  first-named  appellant
    (hereinafter "the appellant") appealed a  decision  of  the  respondent
    made on 3 November 2015 to refuse his application for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur). The  other  appellants  are  his  wife  and
    children who appealed as his dependants.

 2.  The  respondent  refused  the  appellant's  application  primarily  by
    reference to paragraph 322(1A)[1] of the Immigration Rules because:

    "For the purposes of  your  application  dated  07th  March  2013,  you
         submitted a TOEIC  certificate  from  Educational  Testing  Service
         ("ETS") to the Home Office. According to  information  provided  to
         the  Home  Office  by   ETS,   you   obtained   TOEIC   certificate
         0044203504013006 as a result of a test that you took  at  Universal
         Training Centre on 24 April 2013.

    ETS has a record  of  your  speaking  test.  Using  voice  verification
         software, ETS is able to detect when a single person is undertaking
         multiple tests. ETS undertook a check of your test and confirmed to
         the SSHD that there was significant evidence to conclude that  your
         certificate was fraudulently obtained by the use of  a  proxy  test
         taker. ETS have declared your test  to  be  "Invalid"  due  to  the
         aforementioned presence of a proxy  test  taker  who  sat  in  your
         place, and the scores have therefore been cancelled by ETS.

    On the basis of the information provided to her by  ETS,  the  SSHD  is
         satisfied that your certificate was fraudulently obtained."

 3. The fact the  application  was  refused  under  the  mandatory  general
    grounds for refusal meant the application could not succeed  under  the
    rules of the Points-Based System. The English language requirement  was
    not met because of the ETS matter. In any event,  the  application  was
    also refused because the appellant had not provided sufficient evidence
    to show he was engaged in business activity. Nor were  his  advertising
    materials considered to be sufficient to satisfy the specified evidence
    rules. Next, the letter provided from the Bank of Azad Jammu &  Kashmir
    did not contain the mandatory information showing it was  regulated  by
    the appropriate body, such that the appellant had failed to show he had
    access to ï¿½50,000. Finally, the maintenance  requirement  was  not  met
    because the bank statements provided by the appellant did not show  his
    name.

 4. The appellant's solicitors submitted lengthy grounds  of  appeal  which
    maintained that the appellant had sat  the  TOIEC  test  himself.  With
    regard to the other reasons given not to award  the  appellant  points,
    the grounds argued the  respondent  had  not  properly  considered  the
    documents provided. The respondent had not acted fairly and  evidential
    flexibility should have been applied.

 5. The appeal was heard in Birmingham on 24 July  2017  by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Parkes. Counsel for the appellant  indicated  that,
    if he was successful on the ETS deception point,  the  appellant  would
    seek to  argue  that  he  had  accrued  ten  years'  lawful  residence,
    entitling him to a grant of settlement. However, if he  failed  on  the
    deception point, his article 8 claim would  become  "unrealistic".  The
    appellant gave evidence. The judge concluded the respondent  had  shown
    the appellant had used deception in taking the test and  dismissed  the
    appeal.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal in relation
    to all four of the grounds advanced on behalf of the  appellant.  These
    can be summarised as follows:

          1) The judge did not  follow  the  three-stage  approach  to  the
             application of the burden of proof set out  in  SM  and  Qadir
             (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC);

          2) The judge failed to make findings on all the  matters  he  was
             required to do in line with SM  and  Qadir  and  Majumder  and
             Qadir [2016] EWCA Civ 1167;

          3) The judge relied on his understanding that the  appellant  had
             failed to approach ETS following the allegation  of  deception
             but this ignored evidence before him that  the  appellant  had
             emailed ETS on 17 December 2015; and

          4) The judge's reliance on Professor French's opinion on the rate
             of false positives was inconsistent with  the  conclusions  of
             the Upper Tribunal in MA (ETS -  TOEIC  testing)  [2016]  UKUT
             00450 (IAC).

 7. The respondent has not filed a rule 24 response opposing the appeal.

 8. I heard detailed submissions from the representatives on  the  question
    whether the Judge made a material error of law in  his  decision.  They
    are recorded in my record of the proceedings. The  submissions  covered
    all four grounds. Mr Malik, who had represented the  appellant  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal, expanded on his written grounds. Mr  Avery  argued
    that none of the grounds showed the judge had made a material error  of
    law.

 9. It is only necessary  for  one  of  the  grounds,  which  are  mutually
    exclusive, to show that the judge made a material error for the  appeal
    to succeed and for his decision to be set aside. I indicated at the end
    of  the  hearing,  having  listened   to   the   submissions   of   the
    representatives, that I found the judge had erred in  relation  to  the
    third ground. I shall therefore only  set  out  the  arguments  and  my
    reasons in relation to that ground.

10. The judge gave a number of reasons for his ultimate conclusion that the
    respondent had established that the  appellant  had  gained  his  TOEIC
    certificate by means of deception. Among them, he  gave  the  following
    reason:

    "16.     It is not clear if the ETS  issue  was  raised  in  the  first
         Refusal Letters that were issued to the Appellants.  In  any  event
         the ETS issue was raised  as  the  central  issue  in  the  Refusal
         Letters of the 5th of November 2015 and the  Appellants  have  been
         aware since then what the attitude of the Secretary of State was to
         the test results and how it is said that they were obtained. It was
         not until the 27th of February  2017  that  the  Home  Office  were
         approached for the ETS  voice  recognition  file,  some  15  months
         later, there is no evidence to show that ETS have  been  approached
         and there has been  no  application  for  an  adjournment  for  the
         evidence to be obtained and analysed."

11. Evidently, the judge drew an adverse inference from what  he  perceived
    to be delay on the part of the appellant in taking the obvious step  of
    contacting ETS on learning that the respondent believed he had  used  a
    proxy to sit the speaking test.

12. Mr Malik characterised that approach  as  "irrational"  and  "perverse"
    because the appellant had filed evidence in his first  bundle  that  he
    had emailed ETS on 17 December 2015. In fact, there  was  a  series  of
    emails going between the appellant  and  ETS  in  which  the  appellant
    sought to establish what the problem was.

13. Mr Avery accepted there had been an error but argued it was immaterial.
    It would not have affected the outcome.

14. In my judgment,  it  is  not  possible  to  say  that,  had  the  judge
    considered this evidence, he would have come to the same conclusion. It
    is plain the judge proceeded on an incorrect basis in that he  believed
    the appellant had not contacted ETS  on  receiving  the  decision.  His
    conclusion on the deception point was based on  a  mistake  as  to  the
    state of the evidence. The error was material.

15. The  appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  and  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision to dismiss the appeal is set aside.

16.  It  was  not  possible  to  proceed  to  re-make  the  decision.   The
    representatives were in agreement that the appropriate course  was  for
    the appeal to be heard again in the First-tier Tribunal  with  none  of
    the judge's findings preserved.

17. It is unclear why the appeal was listed in Birmingham as the  appellant
    lives in Harrow and his legal team are in London. The appropriate venue
    for the remitted appeal is Hatton Cross.

Notice of Decision

The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error of  law  and  his
decision dismissing the appeal is set aside. The appeal is remitted  to  the
First-tier Tribunal to make fresh findings on the deception allegation.

No anonymity direction is made.
