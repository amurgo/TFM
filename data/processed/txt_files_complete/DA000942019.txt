                            DECISION AND REASONS

This decision has been made on the papers, under Rule  34  of  The  Tribunal
Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, in accordance with the  agreement  of
the parties at a remote hearing on 1 July 2020.

The appellant is a citizen of Portugal born on 4 November  1993.  He  claims
to have arrived in the United Kingdom on 22 July  2011  at  the  age  of  17
years, although there is no evidence of his date of entry. He  arrived  with
his mother and was issued  with  an  EEA  registration  certificate  as  her
dependant on 21 December 2012.

The appellant first came to the adverse attention of the authorities  on  30
December 2013 when he was arrested under the Theft Act and  Police  Act  and
was given a caution  for  shoplifting  and  resisting/obstructing  a  police
constable. Between 8  June  2015  and  15  February  2018  he  received  two
convictions for ten offences, including eight theft  offences,  one  offence
relating to police/courts/prisons and one drugs offence. On 8 June  2015  he
was convicted of possessing a controlled drug class A and given  a  fine  of
ï¿½50; on 5 September 2017 he was convicted on  two  counts  of  burglary  and
theft-dwelling, attempted burglary with  intent  to  steal,  two  counts  of
handling stolen goods, three counts of burglary with  intent  to  steal  and
failing to surrender to custody; and on 15 February 2018  he  was  sentenced
to a total consecutive period of imprisonment of three years and one month.

On 28 January 2019 the respondent made a decision to  deport  the  appellant
pursuant to  regulation  23(6)(b)  and  regulation  27  of  the  Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations").

In making that decision, the respondent did not  accept  that  the  evidence
produced by the appellant was sufficient to demonstrate  that  he  had  been
residing in and exercising treaty rights in the UK in  accordance  with  the
2016 regulations for a continuous period of five  years  and  therefore  did
not accept that  he  had  acquired  a  permanent  right  of  residence.  The
respondent noted that the circumstances of the appellant's offence  involved
burglary of his neighbour's flat when his neighbour had  gone  out  and  two
other  burglaries  whilst  the  householders  were  in  the  premises.   The
respondent observed that the appellant's criminal  offences  were  committed
for monetary gain and considered  that  he  was  likely  to  revert  to  re-
offending if he did not find employment. The respondent considered that  the
appellant represented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  to
the public to justify his deportation  on  grounds  of  public  policy.  The
respondent did not accept that the appellant  was  socially  and  culturally
integrated in the UK and considered that  there  were  no  very  significant
obstacles to his integration into Portugal.  Although  he  had  sickle  cell
anaemia, an inherited condition, and required a blood transfusion every  six
to eight weeks, he could continue with his treatment in Portugal. There  was
no evidence that  the  appellant  had  undertaken  any  rehabilitative  work
whilst in custody and it was  considered  that  his  deportation  would  not
prejudice the prospects of his rehabilitation. The decision  to  deport  him
was  considered  to  be  proportionate  and  in  accordance  with  the   EEA
Regulations.

The respondent went  on  to  consider  Article  8  and  concluded  that  the
appellant could not meet the requirements for the exceptions to  deportation
in paragraph 399(a) or (b) or paragraph 399A of the  immigration  rules  and
that there were no very  compelling  circumstances  outweighing  the  public
interest  in  his  deportation  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  398.  The
respondent concluded that the appellant's deportation would not  breach  his
Article  8  rights  under  the  ECHR.  The  respondent  also  certified  the
appellant's case under regulation 33  on  the  basis  that  his  deportation
during the appeals process would not be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
Human Rights Act 1998 and would not give rise to serious irreversible harm.

The appellant appealed against that decision and his  appeal  was  heard  in
the First-tier Tribunal on 31 October  2019  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
Housego. The judge accepted that the  appellant  had  acquired  a  permanent
right of residence in the UK, but found that he was  a  persistent  offender
whose offences had caused serious harm and who was a danger to  society.  He
dismissed the appeal under the  EEA  Regulations  and  on  Article  8  human
rights grounds.

The appellant was granted permission to appeal Judge Housego's  decision  to
the Upper Tribunal and,  at  an  error  of  law  hearing  on  1  July  2020,
conducted remotely by way of Skype for Business, Ms Cunha, on behalf of  the
Secretary of State, relied upon a further Rule 24 response  from  Mr  Jarvis
conceding that the judge had made material errors of law  in  his  decision.
It was accepted by the respondent that the judge  had  erred  by  conflating
matters under the EEA  Regulations  with  Article  8  matters,  contrary  to
relevant caselaw,  and  had  made  errors  in  his  references  to  previous
offending and to the dates of offences, such that the  decision  had  to  be
set aside. Both parties confirmed that they were content  for  the  decision
to be re-made on the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal and by  way  of
written submissions, without a further hearing. Ms Cunha  had  no  objection
to  the  appellant  obtaining  and  producing  a  current  report  from  his
probation officer.

I therefore set aside Judge Housego's decision and made directions  for  the
service of  skeleton  arguments  and  bundles,  for  the  re-making  of  the
decision.   In   accordance   with   those   directions,   the   appellant's
representatives  made  written  submissions  and  produced  a  supplementary
bundle containing an OASys report and a medical report. The  respondent  has
not, however, provided any submissions or skeleton argument.

The matter has now come back to me to re-make the decision  in  the  appeal.
The time limit for the filing of  the  respondent's  skeleton  argument  has
passed by a significant period of time  and  despite  the  respondent  being
given further  opportunities  to  respond  to  the  directions  and  to  the
evidence filed by the appellant, there has still been no response. I see  no
reason why matters should be delayed further by the  respondent's  continued
failure to comply with my directions, although it would  have  been  helpful
to have submissions from both parties. In any event I have  the  appellant's
written submissions and supplementary bundle, together with  the  bundle  of
documents before the First-tier Tribunal which contains  skeleton  arguments
from both parties.

The respondent did not make any challenge to Judge  Housego's  finding  that
the appellant had acquired a permanent right of residence in the UK  and  it
is therefore accepted that the relevant level of protection afforded to  the
appellant under the EEA Regulations 2016 is that  of  "serious  grounds"  in
Regulation 27(3), namely that: "A relevant decision  may  not  be  taken  in
respect of a person with a right of permanent residence under regulation  15
except on serious grounds of public policy and public security".

The relevant considerations appear in Regulation 27(5) and (6):

    "(5) The public policy and public security requirements of the  United
    Kingdom  include  restricting  rights  otherwise  conferred  by   these
    Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests  of  society,
    and where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy  or
    public security it must also be taken in accordance with the  following
    principles-

         (a) the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;

         (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal  conduct
         of the person concerned;

         (c) the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a  genuine,
         present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society, taking into account past  conduct
         of the person and that the threat does not need to be imminent;

         (d) matters isolated from the particulars  of  the  case  or  which
         relate to considerations of general prevention do not  justify  the
         decision;

         (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not  in  themselves
    justify the decision;

         (f) the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even in  the
         absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the grounds are
         specific to the person.

    (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public  policy
    and public security in relation to a person ("P") who  is  resident  in
    the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must   take   account   of
    considerations such as the age, state of health,  family  and  economic
    situation of P, P's length of residence  in  the  United  Kingdom,  P's
    social and cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the  extent
    of P's links with P's country of origin."


Further  relevant  considerations  appear  in  Schedule   1   to   the   EEA
Regulations.

The first question is whether the appellant represents  a  genuine,  present
and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the  fundamental  interests
of society.

Submissions have been made for the appellant asserting,  at  [17],  that  he
was remorseful and had not been in trouble since his  release  from  prison,
that his offences took place over a brief period in 2017, that he was not  a
persistent offender or career criminal and that the  offences  were  out  of
character. Further positive submissions are made at [19] to [23]  about  the
appellant's engagement with the probation services, his  rehabilitation  and
his integration into the community. However, there is  an  unfortunate  lack
of  supporting  evidence  to  that  effect.  I  have  had  regard   to   the
certificates of achievement, at section E of the appeal  bundle  before  the
First-tier Tribunal, in respect  of  courses  undertaken  by  the  appellant
whilst in prison, and to the two supporting letters at pages 233 and 234  of
the bundle, for which due credit is  given,  but  there  is  an  absence  of
evidence of his progress  and  rehabilitation  since  his  release,  despite
having been released from immigration detention around December 2019.

I now have the benefit of  an  OASys  report,  dated  27  July  2020,  which
provides  further  information,  but  there  is  unfortunately  no   further
supporting evidence from his probation  officer  as  to  his  progress.  The
OASys report itself provides little assistance to the  appellant,  referring
at 2.11 to his reluctance to speak  about  his  offences;  at  4.10  to  the
uncertainty that he  has  been  putting  in  the  required  effort  to  find
employment; at 8.9 and R8.3.1 to the possibility of being  on  the  edge  of
relapse in relation to his previous cannabis addiction and  to  having  used
the drug since his release; and at R10.6 to him remaining a medium  risk  to
the public. Although it is submitted on  the  appellant's  behalf  that  his
offences took place over a short period of time in 2017,  there  is  limited
weight that can be given to that submission, since  he  remained  in  prison
and detention from that time until a few months ago. Further, the  appellant
was referred by the judge who sentenced  him  in  February  2018  as  having
become a "professional burglar" and Judge Housego,  when  referring  to  the
appellant as a "persistent offender" recorded his  mother's  acceptance,  at
[57], of him being a career criminal living on the proceeds of crime.  Other
than the record of the appellant's claim to be motivated  to  change,  there
is little within the OASys report to inspire confidence that that  situation
had permanently changed, despite his apology in his statement of 19  October
2019 at [5].

I have taken account of  the  appellant's  medical  condition,  sickle  cell
anaemia, in the  assessment of the risk of re-offending, but note  that  his
previous offences were committed at a time when his condition  was  no  less
serious, having suffered  a  stroke  in  2012  and  having  from  that  time
received  regular,  six-weekly  blood  transfusions.  A   previous   medical
assessment dated 27 April 2016 (page 220 of the appeal  bundle)  recommended
that he be housed with his family who could  look  after  him.  However  the
medical report of 12 June 2019 at page 199 of the appeal  bundle  refers  to
the appellant's own indication that he was experiencing  fewer  consequences
from his stroke and the latest report dated 26 May 2020 at page  45  of  the
supplementary bundle refers to him not having  been  seen  by  the  hospital
since March 2020 despite being called numerous times. I  cannot,  therefore,
find anything in his medical circumstances to suggest that the risk that  he
poses to the public has been reduced on that basis.

With regard to the appellant's family, in particular his mother and  sister,
and their role in preventing him from re-offending, it is relevant  to  note
that they were unfortunately not able to prevent him offending in the  past.
Supporting statements were provided from both for  the  hearing  before  the
First-tier Tribunal in October 2019, but there is no further  evidence  from
either of them explaining his situation since his release from detention.

Having had regard to the  nature  of  the  appellant's  criminal  offending,
invading people's homes whilst they were sleeping and  stealing  from  them,
and even committing such an offence whilst awaiting trial and on  bail,  and
having considered the sentencing judge's comments on the seriousness of  the
offending and the length of the sentence given, and taking  account  of  the
limited evidence supporting  a  claim  as  to  remorse,  rehabilitation  and
change, it seems to me that the only conclusion from the  evidence  is  that
the appellant continues to represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.

The same considerations apply equally to the assessment of  proportionality.
The most significant and weighty factors in favour of the appellant are  his
family ties in the UK, namely  his  mother  and  sisters,  and  his  medical
condition. However, as I have stated above,  the  evidence  in  relation  to
both is very limited and provides little weight in  the  balance.  There  is
nothing to suggest that the appellant would not  be  able  to  continue  his
medical treatment in Portugal. Furthermore, whilst the  appellant  has  been
away from Portugal for several years, that was the country of his birth  and
was where he lived for 17 years of  his  life.  The  evidence  before  Judge
Housego, as  recorded  at  [53]  and  [54],  was  that  he  retained  family
connections there. There is therefore no reason why he could  not  integrate
back into society there and complete his rehabilitation in that country.

Accordingly, I have to conclude that the  respondent's  decision  to  deport
the appellant is in the fundamental interests of  society,  to  protect  the
public, and is justified on serious grounds  of  public  policy  and  public
security. The decision is in accordance with the EEA  Regulations  2016  and
the appeal is dismissed on that basis.

No separate submissions were made in relation to Article 8 and,  indeed,  on
the findings I have already made above,  the  appellant  cannot  succeed  on
that basis. He does not meet the requirements of paragraphs 399 or  399A  of
the immigration rules on the basis of family and private life and  that  was
conceded in the skeleton argument before the First-tier Tribunal.  There  is
nothing in the appellant's circumstances which can  be  considered  as  very
compelling for the purposes of paragraph 398 of the immigration  rules.  The
most compelling feature of the  appellant's  circumstances  is  his  serious
medical condition, as discussed above, but for the reasons already given  at
[17] above, that is not  a  sufficiently  weighty  factor  to  outweigh  the
public interest in his deportation. Accordingly  the  respondent's  decision
is a  proportionate  one  and  the  appellant's  deportation  would  not,  I
conclude, be in breach of his human rights.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error  on
a point of law requiring it to be set aside.  The  decision  is  re-made  by
dismissing Mr Azevedo's appeal.
