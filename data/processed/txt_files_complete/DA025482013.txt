Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr P Nath a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Ms S Praisoody of counsel instructed by Calices
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
         ("the Secretary of State"). The respondent is a citizen  of  Sierra
         Leone born on 24 August 1971 ("the  claimant").  The  Secretary  of
         State has been given permission to appeal the  determination  of  a
         panel consisting of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Fitzgibbon QC and non-
         legal Member Mr G Getlevog ("the FTT") who allowed  the  claimant's
         appeal against the Secretary of State's decision of 3 December 2013
         to deport him pursuant to the automatic deportation  provisions  in
         section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.


      2. The claimant claimed to have arrived in the UK on 17  August  1998.
         It was not until May 2001 that his  then  representatives  made  an
         application on  his  behalf  for  asylum.  10  September  2001  the
         Secretary of State refused the application, on the  basis  of  non-
         compliance. The claimant lodged notice  of  appeal  but  failed  to
         attend the appeal hearing. An Adjudicator dismissed  his  appeal  5
         April 2002. His appeal rights became exhausted on 24 April 2002.


      3. In October 1998 the claimant married his wife  ("his  wife")  by  a
         proxy ceremony in Ghana. They have four children together. His wife
         has a daughter from a previous relationship.


      4. On 28 July 2005 the claimant was arrested in possession of a forged
         Dutch passport. On 30 October 2005 he was convicted at Inner London
         Crown Court of the offence of using  a  false  instrument  and  was
         sentenced to 4 months imprisonment. He was released on 25  November
         2005.


      5. On 30 October 2006 his wife made an application  under  the  family
         ILR exercise. On 23 May 2007 the Secretary  of  State  refused  the
         application  on  the  basis  that  the  claimant  had  an   unspent
         conviction. His wife contacted a MP who got in touch with the  Home
         Office and the decision was reviewed. His wife  and  children  were
         granted ILR on 22 October 2008 and naturalised as British  citizens
         on 20 November 2009.


      6. On 13 October 2013 the claimant  pleaded  guilty  at  Inner  London
         Crown Court to conspiracy to import a Class B drug  (cannabis)  and
         was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. This was the index offence
         which triggered the deportation decision.


      7. The claimant appealed and the FTT heard his  appeal  4  July  2014.
         Both parties were represented. The claimant gave  evidence  as  did
         his wife. The FTT heard oral submissions and considered a  skeleton
         from the claimant's representatives submitted  after  the  hearing.
         The FTT assessed the index offence. It related to an  agreement  to
         import by post just over 2 kg of cannabis from Ghana.  The  package
         was intercepted and replaced by dummy consignment.  The  claimant's
         role was to act as the addressee and recipient of the package.  The
         judge described his role as akin to that of a "courier" who  helped
         by providing a safe address for receipt of the  drugs  which  would
         then have been passed on to  others.  Sentence  was  passed  on  an
         agreed basis that the claimant was not involved in the organisation
         or importation but only in the first stage of receiving and passing
         on the drugs.  His  role  was  "very  much  at  the  lower  end  of
         significant".


      8. The claimant was given a 10% discount for his late guilty plea  and
         other mitigating factors. The normal starting  point  for  sentence
         would have been 18 months but was reduced to 12 months. There was a
         2013 pre-sentence report which made  reference  to  the  claimant's
         visible remorse and assessed an 8% risk of reoffending  within  two
         years. It was considered that he presented a low risk  of  harm  to
         the public. The claimant said that he  had  agreed  to  commit  the
         offence for a payment of ï¿½500. He agreed to do this for  the  money
         because he was unable to work, felt useless and wanted to help  his
         wife financially and especially with the  forthcoming  birthday  of
         one of his children.


      9. The claimant said that he obtained the  forged  Dutch  passport  in
         2005 because he needed documentation in order  to  get  a  job.  He
         pleaded guilty.


     10. The claimant relied on Article 8 human rights and in particular his
         family life with his wife and their  children.  The  four  children
         were a boy born in 1999 (aged 15), a girl born in 2000 (aged 13), a
         son born in 2003 (aged 11) and a son born in  2007  (aged  7).  His
         stepdaughter was born in 1994 (aged 20).


     11. The Secretary of State had accepted that the decision to remove the
         claimant to Sierra Leone would interfere with his Article  8  human
         rights and might not be in the best interests of the  children  but
         was satisfied that the interference  was  in  accordance  with  the
         permissible aim of the prevention of disorder and crime.


     12. During the hearing the Secretary of State's representative withdrew
         the  contention  that  the  claimant  was  not  in  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship with each of the children for  the  purpose
         of paragraph 399 (a) of the Immigration Rules. The FTT  found  that
         there was such a relationship.


     13. The FTT found the claimant's wife to be an impressive witness.  His
         second period in prison had tested her commitment to  him  but  she
         had forgiven him and believed that he would not re-offend. The  FTT
         concluded that the claimant was fully engaged with his children  as
         a parent and that they had lived together as  a  family  throughout
         their lives save for his two periods of imprisonment. The  claimant
         and his wife were in a devoted and subsisting relationship and  his
         remorse for his offending was sincere.


     14. After setting out the Article 8 provisions  under  the  Immigration
         Rules in paragraph 21 and 22 the FTT found that as the claimant was
         sentenced to less than four years imprisonment  paragraph  399  and
         399A applied. It was necessary to  consider  whether  the  claimant
         could bring himself within the requirements of the Rules and if not
         whether  his  deportation  would  result  in  "unjustifiably  harsh
         consequences for be  individual  or  their  family  such  that  the
         deportation would not be proportionate".


     15. The FTT found that the  children  were  British  citizens  and  the
         claimant complied with the requirements of paragraph 399  (a)  (i).
         There was a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  each
         of them. The Secretary of State  had  conceded  that  it  would  be
         unreasonable for them to leave the UK. In that event his wife would
         be able to care for them in the UK which meant that  he  could  not
         comply with paragraph 399 (a) (ii) (a).


     16. The claimant  and  his  wife  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship for the purposes of paragraph 399 (b) but the claimant
         did not meet the requirements of paragraph 399 (b) (i)  because  he
         had not "lived in the UK with valid leave continuously for at least
         15 years immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision
         (discounting any period of imprisonment)". He  had  not  been  here
         long  enough  to  comply  with  the  alternative   long   residence
         provisions in paragraph 399B.


     17. The FTT reached the conclusion that the appeal  could  not  succeed
         under the Immigration Rules. However, there were  arguable  grounds
         for concluding that the deportation would result  in  unjustifiably
         harsh  consequences  for  the  claimant  and  his  family.   As   a
         consequence the FTT went on  to  consider  the  Article  8  grounds
         outside the Rules.


     18. In paragraph 29 and 30 the FTT took into  account  the  pre-eminent
         public interest in the deportation of foreign  criminals  and  that
         the importation of controlled drugs  into  the  UK  was  a  serious
         matter.  Considerable  weight  was  given  to  the  views  of   the
         sentencing judge as to the limited involvement of the claimant. The
         drugs were Class B (cannabis) not the far more dangerous  Class  A.
         The 12 month sentence was the starting point for the  operation  of
         the automatic deportation process. The claimant was not a dedicated
         drug dealer. His previous conviction was  for  a  wholly  different
         type of offence. He represented a low risk of reoffending  and  his
         reintegration into the family  life  might  help  divert  him  from
         offending not least because his wife had made  it  clear  that  she
         would not tolerate more criminal conduct and he  did  not  want  to
         jeopardise his marriage or his life with the children. The offences
         were not so serious that deterrence was a major  consideration  and
         did  not  call  for  deportation  to  be  used  to  mark  society's
         revulsion.


     19. In paragraph 31 the FTT found that the claimant enjoyed a deep  and
         subsisting relationship with his wife and children and  was  taking
         an active part in their upbringing. She worked as a care  assistant
         for at least three nights a week and often overtime  as  well.  The
         claimant stayed at home and was responsible for the  children  when
         his wife was not there. His wife could not read or write which left
         the claimant with responsibilities for domestic paperwork.  It  was
         concluded that the lives of his wife and children would become much
         more difficult if he was not there to help. Deportation would sever
         the essence of the family ties between the claimant and his family.
         The FTT considered the facts of this  case  against  those  of  the
         authorities referred to.


     20. The Article 8 claim was strong. The best interests and  welfare  of
         the children were a matter of prime concern.  Whilst  there  was  a
         high public interest in the deportation of  foreign  criminals  the
         FTT was satisfies that the effect of deportation would be so severe
         as to outweigh the public interest and would lead to  unjustifiably
         harsh consequences for the claimant and his family.  The  Secretary
         of State had not shown that his deportation would be  proportionate
         interference under Article 8 (2).


     21. The appeal was allowed on Article 8 human rights grounds.


     22. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  which  was
         refused by a judge in the  First-Tier  Tribunal.  However,  it  was
         granted on renewal by a judge in the Upper Tribunal.


     23. In her application to the Upper Tribunal  the  Secretary  of  State
         relied on the grounds of appeal to the First-Tier  Tribunal  and  a
         supplementary ground. The grounds are formulaic and could  usefully
         have been  broken  down  into  separate  grounds  rather  than  run
         together. Distilling them as best I can they submit  that  the  FTT
         erred in law in a number of ways.  Firstly,  by  "failing  to  give
         genuine and proper regard as to the government's view on  what  are
         exceptional circumstances". Secondly, by failing to have regard  to
         the case law which should have  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the
         claimant's circumstances were not exceptional and that  there  were
         no factors which set him apart from an ordinary family life  claim.
         Thirdly, by failing to give adequate consideration to the Secretary
         of State's public interest  policies  given  the  severity  of  the
         offence committed or to the fact that the claimant's  circumstances
         were essentially the same now as they were  when  the  offence  was
         committed. Fourthly, by failing to have regard to not only the risk
         of reoffending by the claimant but also the  purpose  of  deterring
         other foreign criminals. Fifthly, by minimising the serious of  the
         offence to an impermissible extent by observing that  the  claimant
         was not involved with "the far more dangerous Class A" drugs. There
         was no authority or  evidential  basis  for  the  observation  that
         cannabis was less dangerous than a Class A drug.


     24. Mr Nath relied on the grounds of appeal. He questioned whether  the
         Secretary of State's representative at the hearing before  the  FTT
         had conceded that there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship. However, he dropped the point when I asked whether it
         had been raised in the grounds of appeal. It  has  not.  He  agreed
         that the FTT's finding that the claimant could  not  succeed  under
         the Rules was correct. He emphasised that the claimant's  wife  had
         said that she could cope if he was sent back to Sierra  Leone.  The
         claimant had never made any effort to regularise his stay  in  this
         country and still had ties  to  Sierra  Leone.  He  relied  on  the
         observations of the sentencing judge.


     25. Mr Nath submitted a copy of the pre-sentence Probation  Report.  He
         argued that  the  evidence  of  the  claimant's  children  was  not
         individually set out in the determination. In reply to my question,
         he was unable to point me to any part of the grounds of  appeal  in
         which this was raised. I was asked to find that the  FTT  erred  in
         law and to set aside the decision which  could  be  remade  in  the
         Upper   Tribunal   without   adjournment,   further   evidence   or
         submissions.


     26. The essence of Ms Praisoody's submissions was that the FTT had  set
         out the appropriate tests and correctly applied them. She  took  me
         through the findings of fact. All the relevant  evidence  had  been
         given proper consideration. She emphasised that the claimant's wife
         was unable to read or write. Appropriate weight to  been  given  to
         the public interest and the FTT carried out the  correct  balancing
         exercise. I was asked to find that there was no error  of  law  and
         uphold the decision.


     27. In his reply Mr Nath directed my attention to the evidence  in  the
         Probation Report as to the propensity to reoffend. Were it not  for
         his guilty plea and other factors  the  claimant  would  have  been
         sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.


     28. I reserved my determination.


     29. I find no merit in the submission that the FTT failed to take  into
         account the  passage  in  the  Probation  Report  relating  to  the
         question whether the claimant could reoffend if he considered  that
         he needed money. Firstly, this is not in  the  grounds  of  appeal.
         Secondly, I find that the panel made a  proper  assessment  of  the
         contents and conclusions in this report.


     30. I find no  merit  in  the  additional  ground  of  appeal  that  in
         paragraph 29 the FTT went behind the index conviction and sought to
         minimise the seriousness of  the  offence  by  observing  that  the
         narcotics the appellant were involved in were  "not  the  far  more
         dangerous Class A drugs". It is also submitted that the  FTT  erred
         because there was no legal authority or evidential  basis  for  the
         observation that cannabis was less dangerous than a Class  A  drug.
         This is not a complete quotation from the  determination.  The  FTT
         said; "the drugs were Class B drugs (cannabis), not  the  far  more
         dangerous Class A". I regard it as self-evident that a Class B drug
         (cannabis) is less dangerous than a Class A drug or at  least  that
         legislation and the Secretary of State treat them in  this  way.  I
         wonder whether the Secretary of State would  continue  to  publicly
         support the submission that cannabis is as dangerous as a  Class  A
         drug.


     31. I find that the FTT did give genuine and proper regard  as  to  the
         government's view as to what are exceptional circumstances not only
         in the reasoning leading up to the  conclusion  that  the  claimant
         could not succeed under the Rules but in paragraphs 28, 29, 30, 33,
         34 and the final summing up in 35. Clear reasons were given for the
         conclusion that the claimant's circumstances were  exceptional  and
         there were factors which set him apart although I find  that  there
         is a lack of clarity as to what the Secretary of State considers to
         be "an ordinary family  life  claim".  Adequate  consideration  was
         given to the Secretary of State's public  interest  policies  given
         the FTT's assessment of the  severity  of  the  offence  committed.
         There are valid reasons for the findings as to  the  propensity  to
         reoffend in the light of current circumstances. Proper  regard  was
         had  to  society's  revulsion  and  the  deterrence  other  foreign
         criminals in paragraph 30.


     32. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and can see no
         good reason to do so.


     33. I find that the grounds are in essence no  more  than  disagreement
         with conclusions properly reached by the FTT on all  the  evidence.
         There is no error of law. I dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal
         and uphold the determination.
