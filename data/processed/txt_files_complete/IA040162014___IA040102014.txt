                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr A Otchie, Counsel, instructed by M-R Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Specialist Appeals Team

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing their appeal against the decision by the
    Secretary of State to refuse to issue them with EEA residence cards  as
    extended family members of an EEA  national  exercising  treaty  rights
    here.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and
    I do not consider that the appellants should be accorded anonymity  for
    these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The first appellant, Mrs Haleema Afandi, was born on 16 December  1990.
    The second appellant, Mr Ishan  Ellahi,  is  her  husband,  born  on  4
    November 1975.  Both of them are Pakistani nationals, as is  their  son
    who was born in the UK on 23 January 2013.  As the first  appellant  is
    the main appellant in this appeal,  I  shall  hereafter  refer  to  her
    simply as the appellant save where the context otherwise requires.

 3. Mr Ellahi first entered the United Kingdom  in  2008,  apparently  with
    valid entry clearance as a work permit holder.  He returned to Pakistan
    in 2009 for a visit, during which he married the appellant on 8 October
    2009.  Towards the end of her husband's work  permit  employment  as  a
    tailor, the appellant joined him in the UK on 29 January  2012.   After
    her husband's job as a tailor finished, he started working in what  the
    appellant described as a chicken  shop.   He  was  encountered  by  the
    authorities working there, and  the  Home  Office  cancelled  his  work
    permit.  On 26 February 2013 both husband and wife were served  with  a
    form IS15A notice notifying them of their liability  to  administrative
    removal for the husband's breach  of  employment  restrictions.   On  6
    March 2013 the appellants  applied  for  leave  to  remain,  but  their
    applications were refused with no right  of  appeal.   A  human  rights
    application was also lodged, but this was also refused with no right of
    appeal.

 4. On 2 September 2013 the appellant applied for a residence card  as  the
    family member of an EEA national exercising treaty  rights  here.   She
    included her husband and son as dependants on her application.  Her EEA
    national sponsor was Noman Ali Liaqat, a French national, whose date of
    birth was 27 June 1989.  He was related to her as a cousin, and he  had
    been in full-time employment with a firm of accountants in London since
    1 May 2013.

 5. On 30 December 2013  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing to issue the appellant with a residence  card.   She  had  not
    provided sufficient evidence of her  dependency  on  her  EEA  national
    sponsor whilst in Pakistan.  She also had  not  provided  any  evidence
    that she was dependent on her EEA national sponsor immediately prior to
    her entering the United Kingdom, as required under Regulation  8(2)(a).
    She stated that she also wished to  rely  on  family  or  private  life
    established in the UK under Article 8 of the ECHR.  If she  wished  the
    UK Border Agency to consider her application on this basis she  had  to
    make a separate charged application  using  the  appropriate  specified
    application form for the five year partner  route,  or  the  five  year
    parent or ten year partner or parent route, or  the  ten  year  private
    life route.  Since she had not made a valid application for  Article  8
    consideration, it had not been decided whether her removal from the  UK
    would breach Article 8 of the ECHR.  Additionally, it was  pointed  out
    the decision not to issue her with a residence card did not require her
    to leave the United Kingdom if she could otherwise demonstrate that she
    had a right to reside under the Regulations.

 6. The accompanying notice of immigration decision stated she was entitled
    to appeal against the decision under Section  82  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Regulation 26  of  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006.  An appeal had to be made on one or more of the
    following grounds, which the Secretary of State went on to  list.   The
    grounds listed did not include a human rights ground.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The appellants' appeals came before  Judge  Clough  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on the First-tier Tribunal on 12 September  2014.   Both  parties
    were legally represented.  The judge received oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant and her cousin.  In her subsequent decision, she  found  that
    the appellant was maintained in Pakistan after  her  marriage  in  2009
    until she came to the UK in  January  2012  by  her  husband,  who  was
    working in the UK as a tailor with a valid work permit to allow him  to
    do so.  Her evidence was that he sent her the equivalent  of  ï¿½100  per
    month.  This continued until she came to the UK and she lived with  him
    in his flat at an address in Forest Road, London, E17.   Following  his
    arrival in the UK as a dependant on his work permit, her husband was in
    work until his work permit  was  cancelled  after  he  was  encountered
    working in February 2013 a chicken shop. This  was  in  employment  not
    covered by his work permit conditions.

 8. She accepted the sponsor may  have  sent  money  to  the  appellant  in
    Pakistan, but even if it were for the appellant, rather than the  joint
    family in Pakistan, "by no stretch of  the  imagination  could  she  be
    considered dependent on Noman Ali Liaqat considering the money remitted
    to her by her husband."

 9. It was not clear from the sponsor's  evidence  if  he  was  in  the  UK
    exercising his treaty rights until he started trading in  his  shop  in
    Camden Town.  There was no evidence as to his working before that date.
     If he had he been working with Hamad & Co (a firm of  accountants)  as
    claimed, she would have expected him to be able to produce payslips,  a
    P60, or at least some written evidence  from  Hamad  &  Co  as  to  his
    earnings.

10. In addition, she found the sponsor was evasive in giving his  evidence.
    In particular, it was not until he gave oral evidence that he stated he
    was sending money to Pakistan when he was still at school.  She had  no
    doubt that he was aware that what he  said  in  his  witness  statement
    about maintaining the appellant and her  family  in  Pakistan  was  not
    truthful; and  that  she  was  a  married  woman  who  was  financially
    dependent on her husband and maintained by him from earnings in the UK.

11. It was for the appellant to show she was financially dependent  on  her
    sponsor before and after she came to the  UK.   The  judge  was  wholly
    satisfied that she came nowhere near to doing so from  the  information
    before her.  The judge continued in paragraph [22}:

         The appellant has claimed Article 8 is in issue.  This is not so as
         no removal directions have been sent.

The Application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

12. The appellants applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,
    arguing that the judge  did  not  take  into  account  the  exceptional
    circumstances of their case.  The documentary  evidence  needed  to  be
    considered again, and Article  8  had  not  been  considered  properly.



The Eventual Grant of Permission to Appeal

13.  On  21  November  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chambers  refused
    permission to appeal, on the ground that there was no arguable error of
    law arising.  But upon a renewed application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Archer granted permission on 30 March  2015
    in respect of the Article 8 claim.  He  found  there  was  no  arguable
    material error of law in the decision under the Regulations.  But there
    was an arguable material error of law  on  the  basis  that  the  judge
    should have considered Article 8 and permission to appeal  was  granted
    on that ground alone.  His reasoning was that Schedule 1,  paragraph  1
    of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 as read with Section 84(1)(g)
    of the 2002 Act granted the appellants a right of appeal against an EEA
    decision on  the  ground  that  a  hypothetical  removal  would  breach
    protected rights under ECHR.

The Rule 24 Response

14. On 21 April 2014 Karen Pal, a member of the  Specialist  Appeals  Team,
    settled a Rule 24 response opposing  the  appeal.   She  submitted  the
    judge was correct in not dealing with Article  8.   The  appellant  was
    required to make a separate charged application for a consideration  of
    paragraph 276ADE or Appendix FM.  The application was only refused with
    respect to the EEA Regulations and a removal decision was not made.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

15. At the hearing before me, Ms Fijiwala took a different line  from  that
    taken by her colleague.  She accepted that the  statutory  jurisdiction
    of the Tribunal to consider a human rights claim  pursuant  to  Section
    84(1)(g) was engaged, and to that extent the judge was in  error.   But
    the error was not material, as the Tribunal needed only  to  conduct  a
    light touch review.  I asked her what that would involve in this  case.
    She answered it would simply involve the judge directing  herself  that
    questions 1 and 2 of the Razgar test should be answered  in  favour  of
    the respondent, as the appellant's enjoyment of private and family life
    in the United Kingdom was not under any immediate threat.  But  if,  as
    Mr Otchie contended, the appellant  was  entitled  to  a  comprehensive
    review of her Article 8 rights, on the facts the proposed  interference
    was plainly proportionate, and therefore the error of law was still not
    material to the outcome.

Discussion

16. The line taken by Ms Pal of the Specialist Appeals Team in the Rule  24
    response has the virtue of clarity and simplicity, and it is consistent
    with the Court of Appeal decision in Lamichhane [2012] EWCA Civ 260.

17. On the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Lamichhane, Judge Clough was
    right not to entertain an Article 8 claim by the appellant as  (a)  the
    appellant was not facing removal; and (b) the appellant  had  not  been
    served with a Section 120 notice enabling  her  to  appeal  on  Section
    84(1)(g) grounds.

18. Giving the leading judgment of the court, Stanley Burnton LJ  expressly
    disapproved the earlier Court of Appeal decision in Mirza  &  Others  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 159.

19. In Mirza, the court found that the Secretary of State  had  a  duty  to
    serve a one-stop notice because it  had  "duties  of  fairness  towards
    individuals whose lives are on hold, and who may well be  committing  a
    criminal offence by their mere presence, while they await an appealable
    decision".

20. Stanley Burnton LJ described this approach as judicial legislation, not
    interpretation.  He rejected the submission that the Secretary of State
    was under a duty to serve a Section 120 notice, or indeed that she  was
    under such a duty unless there was a good reason not  to  do  so.   The
    Section conferred a discretionary power, as held in AS (Afghanistan).

21. He went on to conclude at paragraph [41] that an appellant on  whom  no
    Section 120 notice has been served may not raise  before  the  Tribunal
    "any ground for the grant of leave to remain different from that  which
    was the subject of the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  appealed
    against".

22. However, in the light of  the  stance  taken  before  me  today  by  Ms
    Fijiwala (which is also apparently the same stance that has been  taken
    by the Secretary of State in a pending decision by a Presidential panel
    on this difficult area of law) I will not  dispose  of  the  appeal  on
    Lamichanne grounds.  Following the route map outlined by Ms Fijiwala in
    her extensive skeleton argument, the question which I have to decide is
    whether the judge's failure to conduct a light touch review  translates
    into a material error of law.

23. Mr Otchie does not accept  the  underlying  premise  of  Ms  Fijiwala's
    skeleton argument which is that only a light touch review is  required.
    But on the facts of this case, the distinction between the two types of
    review (light  touch  versus  comprehensive)  is  irrelevant.   On  the
    evidence relied upon before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  no  reasonable
    Tribunal properly directed could have reached any other conclusion than
    that the alternative claim under Article 8 should be dismissed.

24. For the appellant did not seek to argue before the First-tier  Tribunal
    that either she or any other member of her family came within the scope
    of Appendix FM or Rule 276ADE.  So  for  a  putative  Article  8  claim
    outside the Rules to have any traction,  there  had  to  be  compelling
    circumstances: see SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [33]:
         In our judgment, even though a  test  of  exceptionality  does  not
         apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it  is
         accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of
         special contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances
         would need to be identified to support a claim  for  grant  of  LTR
         outside the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  In  our  view,  that  is  a
         formulation which is not as strict as a test of exceptionality or a
         requirement of "very compelling reasons"  (as  referred  to  in MF
         (Nigeria) in the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to  foreign
         criminals), but which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
         consideration of public interest factors as finds expression in the
         Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in  Appendix  FM.
         It also reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which has
         been  tested  and  has  survived  scrutiny  in  this  court:   see,
         e.g., Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ.

25. The appellant did not identify any arguably compelling circumstances.

26. Mr Otchie submitted that it could be inferred from  the  evidence  that
    the appellant has established family  life  with  her  cousin  for  the
    purposes  of  Article  8  because  it  could  be  inferred   that   the
    relationship between them went beyond the normal ties  to  be  expected
    between adult relatives.  But the witness statement evidence before the
    First-tier Tribunal only asserted financial dependency.  There  was  no
    suggestion of emotional dependency. It was not part of the  appellant's
    case that she had established family  life  with  her  cousin  for  the
    purposes of Article 8 ECHR.

27. In the absence  of  compelling  circumstances  militating  against  the
    appellant returning with her husband and child to Pakistan, the  public
    interest was decisively weighted in favour of the  family  leaving  the
    country voluntarily or accepting the Secretary of State's invitation to
    make a separate charged application for leave to remain  on  Article  8
    grounds.

Conclusion

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
