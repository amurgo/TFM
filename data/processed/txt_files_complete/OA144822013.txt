Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms N Mallick, instructed by RLegal Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Shurong Wang, date of birth 23.11.65, is  a  citizen  of
    China.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Carroll promulgated 22.9.14, dismissing her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 14.6.13, to refuse entry clearance to
    the United Kingdom for settlement as the spouse of Michael Holmes,  the
    respondent relying on paragraph 320(11) of the Immigration Rules.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 14.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Simpson  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    22.9.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 7.1.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Carroll should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  briefly  summarised  as
    follows. The appellant came to the UK with leave as a domestic  worker,
    limited until 15.11.07. She did not leave and thus became an overstayer
    illegally present in the  UK.  She  met  the  British  citizen  sponsor
    Michael Holmes in 2009. They began a relationship in  March  2010,  and
    lived together for some 2 years. As her  visa  had  expired  they  were
    unable to marry in the UK. Consequently she left  for  China  in  March
    2012, with the intention to apply to return  as  a  spouse.  They  were
    married in China on 2.6.12.

 7. Judge Carroll considered the refusal on 320(11), referencing PS and the
    Statutory Guidance, reaching the conclusion at  �21  that  the  refusal
    decision was entirely lawful. The judge then went on  to  consider  the
    circumstances of the appellant and Mr  Holmes  in  an  article  8  ECHR
    private and family life assessment, reaching the conclusion at �22 that
    the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was proportionate to  those
    rights. In the circumstances, the appeal was dismissed.

 8. In essence, the grounds contend:

      a) The judge was mistaken in regarding the burden of proof to fall  on
         the appellant  in  relation  to  320(11),  when  it  falls  on  the
         respondent to demonstrate  that  the  appellant  has  contrived  to
         frustrate the Rules;

      b) Erred in finding the refusal under 320(11) justified, the appellant
         relying on PS (paragraph 320(11)  discretion:  care  needed)  India
         [2010] 4UKUT 440 (IAC);

      c) Perversely found that the appellant's departure from the UK to sort
         out her immigration status was an aggravating factor;

      d) Failed to take into account the appellant's family  life  with  her
         husband;

      e) Failed to make credibility findings  in  relation  to  the  witness
         evidence;

      f) Failed to take into account that the sponsor had family  life  with
         his elderly widowed father in the UK.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Simpson pointed  out  that  the
    burden on proof in establishing 320(11) rests  on  the  respondent  and
    considered it arguable that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  not
    applied the correct  burden  and  standard  of  proof.  The  judge  was
    incorrect to suggest that the standard "is at the  higher  end  of  the
    balance of probabilities."  The  standard  is  simply  the  balance  of
    probabilities.

10. Judge Simpson also considered the reference to the appellant  having  a
    'premeditated intention  to  work'  was  arguably  not  an  aggravating
    feature when a person enters the UK with leave as  a  domestic  worker.
    "Finally, it is arguable that the appellant has not sought to frustrate
    the intention of the rules - indeed, by returning to China to make  her
    application from abroad she has complied precisely with the rules.  The
    decision reveals an arguable material error of law."

11. The Rule 24 response criticises the  grant  of  permission,  submitting
    that to characterise an intention to work outside the  requirements  of
    her visa as  not  an  aggravating  factor  is  arguably  perverse.  The
    appellant entered on a wholly false basis as a claimed domestic  worker
    when she never was and never intended to  be.  It  is  noted  that  the
    grounds of application for permission to appeal do  not  challenge  the
    appellant's immigration history. In the circumstances,  the  burden  of
    proof issue is irrelevant as the facts  speak  for  themselves.  It  is
    submitted that the findings were entirely open to the judge.

12. In what I find to  be  a  careful  and  well-reasoned  decision,  Judge
    Carroll set out the factual  background,  relevant  law,  findings  and
    conclusions.

13. At �19 Judge Carroll reached the conclusion that there was no  credible
    evidence that the appellant had  ever  within  the  conditions  of  her
    limited leave. In interviews she said she came to the UK with an  agent
    to work as a housemaid but she only ever had one job and did not change
    employment, working in a fish and chip restaurant in Malmesbury. In her
    first witness statement she said after entering the UK she  looked  for
    employment opportunities in order to support herself and found work  in
    a local fish and chip shop, where she met the sponsor Mr.  In  a  later
    witness statement produced for the appeal hearing, she claimed she came
    to the UK with her employer Mrs Birula, but as she  was  treated  badly
    she left shortly after arriving in the UK. It is clear  the  judge  did
    not accept that evidence. It is also clear that appellant never had any
    intention to leave and in this regard I note her reference to using  an
    agent to come to the UK.

14. I do not accept that the judge placed the burden on the  appellant,  as
    it seems to me that all the judge was doing at  �2  was  to  state  the
    general burden of proof. However, even if she did misplace the  burden,
    as the respondent has pointed out, on the facts of this  case  that  is
    irrelevant as her immigration history  has  not  been  challenged.  The
    standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, B [2008] UKHL 35.

15. In relation to the 320(11) criteria, the judge carefully considered the
    provision, the case law and the Guidance and noted that a  mere  breach
    of immigration law would not be sufficient; there has to be aggravating
    circumstances. It is clear from the decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer that reliance was placed on 320(11) for a  number  of  factors,
    including: overstaying; failure to notify any change in employment  for
    which leave to enter had been  given;  working  illegally;  absence  of
    evidence of payment of tax or National Insurance contributions.

16. It is relevant to point out that  there  was  also  a  Entry  Clearance
    Manager review following receipt of the grounds of appeal.  In  a  very
    lengthy consideration the Entry Clearance Manager analysed the  grounds
    of appeal and evidence. It is beyond doubt that  careful  consideration
    was given to the application of 320(11) and the article 8 assessment in
    the light of the circumstances of the appellant and Mr  Holmes.  It  is
    pointed out that the appellant not only overstayed but worked illegally
    in employment  she  had  not  notified  to  the  Home  Office,  thereby
    obtaining services and support, namely the employment, to which she was
    not entitled. The voluntary departure of the appellant  is  also  taken
    into account and assessed.

17. The Guidance itself sets  out  as  one  of  a  number  of  examples  of
    aggravating factors, previous working in breach of  visitor  conditions
    within a short time of arrival in the UK.  There is  no  merit  in  the
    submission that the  judge  was  perverse  by  finding  a  pre-mediated
    intention to work. What the  judge  was  relying  on  at  �20  was  the
    findings at �19 and �20 that not only  did  the  appellant  never  work
    within the terms of her domestic work visa, but she never  intended  to
    do so. In the circumstances, the  judge  was  entitled  to  regard  the
    appellant's behaviour as contrived in a significant  way  to  frustrate
    the intention of the immigration rules. She took and remained  in  non-
    authorised employment for a significant  period  of  time,  overstaying
    whilst working illegally for a period of over 4 years. Even  though  it
    is said that the appellant returned to China voluntarily, it  is  clear
    that she only did so because she was apparently unable to marry in  the
    UK. There is no doubt that the judge took the return into  account,  as
    it is referenced in �20 before the conclusion on 320(11) at �21.

18. In the circumstances, I find the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in
    relation to immigration grounds entirely justified as  a  decision  the
    judge was entitled to reach and for  which  cogent  reasons  have  been
    given. The circumstances were truly aggravating and comprised more than
    mere overstaying. The grounds of application for permission  to  appeal
    essentially seek to reargue the issues in the appeal and  are  no  more
    than a disagreement with the judge's findings.

19. I also find no error of law in relation to the article 8 assessment. In
    addition to those factors taken  into  account  by  the  Judge  in  the
    proportionality assessment, I pointed out to Ms Mallick  that  although
    section 117B had not come into force at the date of hearing, it was  in
    force before the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was promulgated on
    22.9.14. It follows that even though the judge did  not  apply  section
    117B when considering whether any error of law is sufficient to require
    the decision to be set aside and remade  it  is  a  matter  I  have  to
    consider as applicable to an assessment  of  the  public  interest.  In
    particular, 117B(4) provides that, "Little weight should be  given  to-
    (a) a private life, or (b) a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying
    partner, that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
    in the United Kingdom unlawfully." Added to those  factors  taken  into
    account by Judge Carroll, I fail to see how the decision of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer could be regarded as disproportionate. The  appellant
    and Mr Holmes entered into a relationship in 2010 at a  time  when  the
    appellant knew she was not entitled to remain in the UK. He  even  went
    to China to marry her after she had left the UK. Although she left  the
    UK voluntarily, that does not excuse the flagrant breach of immigration
    law by her coming to the UK in the first place under what can  only  be
    considered as false pretences and proceeding to benefit  from  life  in
    the UK over several years. Article 8 is not a  shortcut  to  compliance
    with Immigration Rules. As  with  the  appellant  AB  (Somalia)  in  VW
    (Uganda) [2009] EWCA Civ 5, this is not a case  of  enforced  break-up.
    The pairing and parting of Mr Holmes and the appellant  was  voluntary,
    as was his decision to continue the relationship even  though  she  was
    outside the UK. There was nothing unreasonable in  those  circumstances
    about expecting Mr Holmes to continue family life, if he so wishes,  by
    joining the appellant in China. He decided to form the relationship  at
    a time when he knew her status was precarious and decided to marry when
    it was far from clear that she would be able to meet  the  requirements
    to settle in the UK, given her poor immigration history. The judge took
    into account all relevant factors in reaching the conclusion  that  the
    decision was proportionate.

Conclusion & Decision:

20. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.








Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
