                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                     RR

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Gulvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss L Appiah of Counsel instructed by Charles Annon
& Co.

    1)  Article 32 of the Refugee Convention applies only to a refugee  who
    has been granted leave to enter and to stay in the  United  Kingdom  in
    accordance with para 334 of the Immigration Rules: Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department v ST (Eritrea) [2010] EWCA Civ 643 applied.


    2) As Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention itself  makes  clear,  in
    cases in which a claimant has more than one nationality,  he  will  not
    qualify as a refugee if he can  avail  himself  of  the  protection  of
    another country of which he is a national.


    3) In an asylum appeal in which the claimant has only  one  country  of
    nationality (country A), it is permissible for the Secretary  of  State
    to propose more than one country of destination (country B etc): see JN
    (Cameroon) [2009] EWCA Civ 643 [23].


    4) The question then, is whether by reference  to  A,  the  country  of
    nationality, the claimant is a refugee.  If  he  is  not,  the  Refugee
    Convention does not apply to him. If he is,  his  appeal  falls  to  be
    allowed only if his return to country B would be contrary to Article 33
    of the Refugee Convention.


    5) In any event, possible removal to a country  not  specified  in  the
    notice of decision under appeal is not a  matter  for  the  immigration
    judge.




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The respondent (hereafter "the claimant") is a national of Syria  born
    on 21 March 1977.  She is married to a national of Algeria.  They  have
    three children.  On 5 June 2008 the Secretary of State made a  decision
    to remove her from the United Kingdom  having  decided  to  reject  her
    asylum claim. The Secretary of State also indicated that the  intention
    was to remove the claimant either to Syria or Algeria.   She  appealed.
    In a determination notified on 25 July 2008 Immigration Judge (IJ) R  B
    L Prior allowed her  appeal  on  asylum,  humanitarian  protection  and
    Article 3 ECHR grounds.  That was on the basis that she  had  satisfied
    him she had a well-founded fear of persecution in Syria  and  that  she
    was "a refugee from Syria with no prospect of obtaining the  protection
    of a country other than the  United  Kingdom".   By  the  time  of  the
    hearing before the IJ, the Secretary of State had  clarified  that  the
    intention was to issue directions for her removal to Algeria.

2.    The reason  why  Algeria  was  identified  as  a  removal  destination
    stemmed from the claimant's threefold links with that country,  through
    her being married to an Algerian national, through having children  who
    were Algerian nationals and through having lived there  for  some  nine
    months immediately prior to flying to the UK in September 2007.

3.    The Secretary of State  was  successful  in  obtaining  an  order  for
    reconsideration.  Following a hearing on 29  October  2008  before  SIJ
    Storey the Tribunal found that the IJ had materially erred  in  law  in
    several respects.  In deciding that the claimant could not  be  removed
    to Algeria the  IJ  had  relied  merely  upon  the  acceptance  by  the
    Presenting Officer that "he had no  evidence  to  place  before  me  to
    satisfy me that the claimant had any prospect whatsoever  of  obtaining
    entry to Algeria".  That wrongly placed the  burden  of  proof  on  the
    Secretary of State. The IJ  had  also  failed  to  understand  that  in
    deciding the issue under s 84(1)(g) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") the question was purely a hypothetical
    one undertaken on the assumption that the appellant will  be  returned:
    see GH [2005] EWCA Civ 1182.  The IJ should not have treated the  issue
    of whether or  not  an  appellant/claimant  had  the  necessary  travel
    documentation as material, since  it  was  a  consideration  that  only
    became relevant at  the  stage  when  the  Secretary  of  State  issued
    (actual) removal directions.  (We would observe that in HH  and  Others
    (Somalia) [2010] EWCA Civ 426 the Court of Appeal  has  confirmed  that
    travel documentation is  not  a  material  issue:  see  [83];  also  MS
    (Palestinian Territories) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2010] UKSC 25, 16 June 2010, [26]-[27]).

4.    The  IJ  also  erred  in  allowing  the  appeal  on  both  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection grounds, as they are mutually exclusive.

5.    The case was listed for a stage 2  determination,  the  parties  being
    directed to adduce relevant authorities  on  the  issue  of  whether  a
    person accepted as being a refugee was entitled to  the  protection  of
    the Refugee Convention (Article 32(1) in particular) in the context  of
    a s 84(1)(g)  ground  of  appeal,  and  to  furnish  information  about
    Algerian law on family reunion.

6.    Much of the hearing before us was devoted to submissions  relating  to
    Articles 33 and 32(1). Article 33 (headed "Prohibition of expulsion  or
    return ("refoulement") states:

         "1.      No Contracting State shall expel or return ("refouler")  a
             refugee  in  any  manner  whatsoever  to  the   frontiers   of
             territories where his life or freedom would be  threatened  on
             account of his race, religion, nationality,  membership  of  a
             particular social group or political opinion.


         2. The benefit of  the  present  provision  may  not,  however,  be
             claimed by a refugee whom there  are  reasonable  grounds  for
             regarding as a danger to the security of the country in  which
             he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgement of a
             particular  serious  crime,  constitutes  a  danger   to   the
             community of that country."


7.    Article 32, headed "Expulsion", states:

         "1.      The Contracting States shall not expel a refugee  lawfully
             in their territory save on grounds  of  national  security  or
             public order.


         2. The expulsion of such a refugee shall be only in pursuance of  a
             decision reached  in  accordance  with  due  process  of  law.
             Except where compelling reasons of national security otherwise
             require, the refugee shall be allowed to  submit  evidence  to
             clear himself, and to appeal to and  be  represented  for  the
             purpose before competent authority  or  a  person  or  persons
             specially designated by the competent authority.

         3. The Contracting States shall allow the application of  the  safe
             third country concept shall be subject to rules laid  down  in
             national legislation, including "rules requiring a  connection
             such a refugee a reasonable period  within  which  seek  legal
             admission  into  another  country.   The  Contracting   States
             reserve the right to apply during that  period  such  internal
             measures as they may deem necessary."


8.    Although at the date of the hearing we sat as  judges  of  the  Asylum
    and Immigration Tribunal (AIT), we must now complete it  as  judges  of
    the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the Upper Tribunal  (UTIAC).  The
    effect of legislative changes in force from 15 February  2010  is  that
    our task now is to remake the decision.

9.    We pause before going further to make three  observations.  First,  we
    are not concerned here with every category of case in which immigration
    judges are required to consider a claimant's situation in more than one
    country. In particular, we are not dealing here with the situation that
    arises when a claimant  has  dual  or  multiple  nationality.  In  that
    category of case, even if a person can show he has a well-founded  fear
    of persecution in one of his countries  of  nationality,  he  will  not
    qualify as a refugee if he can  avail  himself  of  the  protection  of
    another country of which he is a national:  see  Sedley  J  in  R  v  A
    Special Adjudicator, ex p Abudine [1995] Imm AR 60 at 63. As stated  in
    the 1979 UNHCR Handbook at [106]:


         "In the case of a person who has more  than  one  nationality,  the
         term "the country of  his  nationality"[in  Article  1A(2)  of  the
         Refugee Convention]  shall mean each of the countries of  which  he
         is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be  lacking  the
         protection of the country of his nationality if, without any  valid
         reason based on well-founded fear, he has not  availed  himself  of
         the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national."


10.   Second, different considerations apply in cases (such as  the  instant
    case) in which the claimant has only one  country  of  nationality  but
    where the Secretary of State in the course of  the  appeal  proceedings
    has proposed more than one country of destination. The  fact  that  the
    respondent in this case has  proposed  in  a  notice  first  one,  then
    another country of removal does not affect our jurisdiction  to  decide
    the appeal or impair the appellant's ability to pursue her  appeal.  As
    stated by Richards LJ in JN (Cameroon) [2009] EWCA Civ 643 at [23]:

         "the required statement in the notice is no more than a proposal as
         at the time of the notice:  it  is  a  statement  of  the  proposed
         destination, and more than one destination may be proposed. What is
         and is not ultimately decided on as the actual destination and what
         is permissible as  an  actual  destination,  may  depend  upon  the
         outcome of any appeal process and any further consideration by  the
         Secretary of State."


11.   Third, the type of case with which we are  concerned  here,  involving
    intended expulsion of a refugee, tends only to arise  as  a  matter  of
    international state practice in situations where the  person  concerned
    has some connection with the third state which  is  said  to  be  safe,
    based  on  nationality,  prior  residence,  marriage,  entitlement   to
    residence, historical ties etc. it does not arise simply because  there
    is a safe third country somewhere. Within the EU, the requirement of  a
    connection is  now  stipulated  in  Council   Directive  2005/84/EC  on
    minimum standards on procedures  in  Member  States  for  granting  and
    withdrawing refugee  status  at  Article  27,  which  states  that  the
    application of the safe third country concept shall be subject to rules
    laid  down  in  national  legislation,  including  "rules  requiring  a
    connection between the person seeking  asylum  and  the  third  country
    concerned on the basis of which it would be reasonable for that  person
    to go to that country" (Article 27(2)(a)).


12.    Miss Appiah accepted that it had been clarified through  and  in  the
    course of the appeal process that the proposed country  of  removal  of
    the claimant had changed from Syria to Algeria.


13.   As things have transpired the principal arguments between the  parties
    concerning this type of case have now been  resolved  by  the  judgment
    handed down by the Court of Appeal on 9 June 2010 in Secretary of State
    for the Home Department v ST (Eritrea) [2010] EWCA Civ  643  (hereafter
    ST (Eritrea)). The Tribunal being made aware shortly after the  hearing
    that the Court of Appeal was soon to issue judgment in this  case  also
    explains some of the considerable delay on  our  part  in  promulgating
    this decision.  Even though both parties were aware of  the  concurrent
    proceedings in the Court of Appeal - and so must have expected that  we
    might delay to await their judgment - we do  regret  the  overall  time
    this case has taken.  We should also add  that  following  the  handing
    down of judgment in  ST  (Eritrea)  we  did  consider  whether  it  was
    appropriate  to  ask  the  parties  for  their   submissions   on   its
    implications for this appeal.  In the end we decided there would be  no
    point (and only more delay). ST (Eritrea) is binding  on  us.  Further,
    although Miss Appiah before us relied heavily on submissions which were
    subsequently rejected in ST (Eritrea); she also put forward a secondary
    submission to the effect that if those were  wrong,  the  claimant  was
    still entitled to succeed by virtue of the risks she faced in  Algeria.
    In the event we have found we agree  with  her  that  the  claimant  is
    entitled to succeed on the basis of this secondary argument, which does
    not depend on the Article 32(1) question.


Syria

14.   The Secretary of State does not challenge the IJ's  finding  that  the
    claimant has a well-founded fear of  persecution  in  Syria.  She  also
    accepts that  the  claimant  faces  persecution  there  for  a  Refugee
    Convention reason, namely political opinion. In essentials the IJ found
    that she faced a real risk of serious harm there because  she  was  the
    daughter of  a  long-standing  and  well-known  member  of  the  Muslim
    Brotherhood who had suffered imprisonment and torture at the  hands  of
    the Syrian authorities.  The IJ attached  significant  weight  to  "the
    detailed evidence of the extensive persecution of the claimant's family
    in Syria, prior to their flight to Turkey" and the claimant's  evidence
    that her sister had been imprisoned on return to Syria.

Algeria

15.   It is as well to delineate before going further the  IJ's  contrasting
    findings in respect of the claimant's experiences in Algeria and at the
    hands of the Algerian authorities.  The IJ did not accept her  evidence
    as to her experiences in Algeria following her arrival in that  country
    on 20 January 2007.  She had claimed that she had attracted the adverse
    attention of the Algerian authorities by using a false Syrian passport.
     She claimed that this led to her  being  questioned  and  subsequently
    arrested, raped and blackmailed and to her seeking funds to  bribe  two
    members of the Algerian security forces. In turn this led, she claimed,
    to her husband's family pressurising him to abandon and disown  her  as
    someone who had dishonoured the family.  This account, the IJ  decided,
    was not credible.  In the decision finding a material error of law  the
    Tribunal directed that the IJ's rejection of this part of the  evidence
    was not to be revisited at the next hearing and for  our  part  we  are
    satisfied that this direction should stand.   Having  said  that,  both
    parties agreed with us, especially in the light  of  the  new  evidence
    from the Honorary Legal Advisor to the British  Consulate  in  Algeria,
    that it had to remain  for us to  decide  whether,  even  taking  these
    adverse findings as a given, the appellant would be at risk of indirect
    refoulement from Algeria to Syria.

Discussion

16.   Mr Gulvin confirmed that it was conceded by the Secretary of State  at
    least for the purposes of this appeal that the claimant  fulfilled  all
    the requirements of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention and was thereby
    properly to be considered a refugee.  Pausing there, we note that in so
    conceding Mr Gulvin was doing no more than reflecting the correct legal
    position:  regulation  2  of  the  Refugee  or  Person   in   Need   of
    International Protection Regulations 2006 defines 'refugee' as  meaning
    "a person who falls within Article 1A of the Geneva Convention  and  to
    whom regulation 7 [which deals with exclusion] does not apply."

17.   ST (Eritrea) concerned a national of Eritrea who had been found by  an
    Adjudicator  in  February  2005  to  possess  a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution in Eritrea. The Adjudicator had nevertheless dismissed  her
    appeal because he considered she could safely be returned  to  Ethiopia
    where she had  formerly  resided.   On  reconsideration,  however,  his
    decision was found to be wrong in law and the AIT decided to substitute
    a  decision  allowing  her  appeal.   When  the  Secretary   of   State
    subsequently decided to issue fresh removal  directions  for  Ethiopia,
    the appellant sought judicial review of the refusal  to  implement  the
    decision of the Tribunal.  On  judicial  review  the  appellant  argued
    successfully before Deputy High  Court  Judge  Pitchford  that  as  the
    appellant had been found by the  Tribunal  to  be  a  refugee  and  the
    Secretary of State was bound by the unappealed decision of the AIT, the
    decision of the Secretary of State to decline to grant  refugee  status
    (because he considered she could be returned safely to Ethiopia) should
    be quashed and the Secretary of State should be ordered to recognise ST
    as a refugee and grant her leave to remain.

18.   In ST (Eritrea) Burnton LJ concluded:

          (i)       that a study of the international  authorities  revealed
             that:


               "... a refugee is not entitled to the protection  of  Article
              32 unless he or she has been  granted  the  right  of  lawful
              presence in the state in question. The phrase  "r�guli�rement
              sur leur territoire" in  the  French  text,  set  out  above,
              supports this interpretation. Whether a refugee  is  lawfully
              in the territory of a state is  determined  by  its  domestic
              law. However, any refugee is entitled to  the  protection  of
              Article 33, whatever the legal status of his  presence  under
              national law"([39]).


          ii) that on closer examination of UK legislation  and  case  law,
              Szoma v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005]  UKHL
              64 [2006] and JA (Ivory Coast) and ES (Tanzania) v  Secretary
              of State for the Home Department  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  1353  in
              particular, Article 32 applies only to a refugee who has been
              granted leave to enter and to stay in the United  Kingdom  in
              accordance with para 334 of the Immigration Rules (see  [40]-
              [52] of the judgment);


         iii) the ground specified in s 84(1)(c) and (g) of  the  2002  Act
              relate to  whether  a  person's  removal  would  breach  this
              country's obligations under the Refugee Convention  [and  the
              European Convention on Human Rights] (see [56]), and

          iv) the decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  Saad,  Diriye  and
              Osorio v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2002]
              EWCA Civ 2008  did  not  require  the  determination  of  the
              Tribunal to have the effect of a direction to  the  Secretary
              of State to grant asylum ([58]).


19.   In the light of the judgment in ST  (Eritrea)  it  is  unnecessary  to
    address submissions of the parties concerning the issue of whether  the
    IJ should or could have  allowed  the  appeal  solely  because  of  his
    finding that she was  a  refugee  (from  Syria).   ST  (Eritrea)  makes
    abundantly clear that the fact of being found to be a refugee does  not
    of itself entitle a claimant to the grant of asylum and that Article 32
    only applies to a refugee who has been given the right lawfully to stay
    in the Contracting State in question.  We would only add four comments.
     First, within days of judgment being handed down  in  ST (Eritrea)  a
    different panel of the Court of Appeal in Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department v IA (Turkey) [2010] EWCA Civ 625, 15 June 2010 came to
    the same conclusion on this issue: see [30].  It is perhaps unfortunate
    that neither panel appeared aware that the same point was being  raised
    in the other's case, but that  does  not  make  either  case  any  less
    binding on us.

20.   Second, if the Court in ST (Eritrea) had accepted ST's contentions  it
    would have created an inconsistency with the judgment  of  the  Supreme
    Court in ZN (Afghanistan) and  Ors v Entry Clearance Officer  (Karachi)
    [2010] UKSC 21 in which Lord Clarke, delivering  the  judgment  of  the
    court, approved observations made by Laws LJ in the court below that it
    is no part of the definition of "refugee" that the subject be  formally
    recognised as such in the form of a grant of asylum; the latter  was  a
    separate event: see  [28]-[32] of the SC judgment and  MS  (Somalia)  &
    Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA  Civ  1236
    [22]-[24].

21.   Third, it seems to us that (excluding the situation where  a  claimant
    has more than one  nationality)  the  judgment  in  ST  (Eritrea)  also
    clarifies how s 84(1)(c) and (g) are to be applied when  the  Secretary
    of State has indicated in the course of  the  appeal  proceedings  that
    there is more than one country  to  which  she  is  proposing  to  make
    removal directions. In ST (Eritrea), so far as the  appeal  proceedings
    were concerned, removal directions were  only  ever  proposed  for  one
    country (Eritrea), but the logic of what Burnton LJ said  in  [56]-[57]
    is that if the Secretary of State has identified an alternative country
    of proposed removal  (country  B)  in  the  context  of  asylum  appeal
    proceedings, then an immigration judge  should  only  allow  an  asylum
    appeal if satisfied not only that a claimant is a refugee from  country
    A but also that  return to country B would also be contrary to  Article
    33 of the Refugee Convention.

22.   Fourth, and conversely, if the Secretary of State has  only  indicated
    one country  of  proposed  removal  in  the  course  of  asylum  appeal
    proceedings and that country is found to be one in which  the  claimant
    faces a well-founded fear of persecution, it is no part of the function
    of an immigration  judge  to  dismiss  an  appeal  because  he  or  she
    considers there is another country which is safe.  That is, after  all,
    where the Adjudicator in the appeal proceedings in  ST  (Eritrea)  went
    wrong.

23.   If  the  claimant  is  entitled  to  succeed  in  her  appeal  to  us,
    therefore, it can only be on  the  basis  of  Miss  Appiah's  secondary
    submission that she was not only a refugee  from  Syria  but  was  also
    someone who would not be safe in Algeria,  the  country  to  which  the
    Secretary of  State now proposed to make removal directions.

24.   Both parties accept it as settled law  that  Article  33(1)  would  be
    breached by a removal whose effect would be, directly or indirectly, to
    return the appellant to a  country  or  territory  where  her  life  or
    freedom would be threatened. That  acceptance  reflects  the  principle
    established in leading cases that Article 33 prohibits both direct  and
    indirect refoulement. As Lord Hobhouse stated in R v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department ex parte Adan and Aitsegeur [2000] UKHL 67:

         "For a country to return a refugee to a state from  which  he  will
         then be returned by the government of that  state  to  a  territory
         where his life or freedom will be threatened  will  be  as  much  a
         breach of Article 33 as if the first country  had  itself  returned
         him there direct.  This is the effect of Article 33."

25.   This position was confirmed in R (Yogathas) [2002] UKHL 36 and by  the
    European Court of Human Rights in TI v United Kingdom [2000] INLR 211.

26.   On the Article 33 issue Mr Gulvin submitted that  the  claimant  would
    not face a real risk of persecution or  serious  harm  in  Algeria  and
    furthermore, she could obtain protection from Algeria.   In  regard  to
    the issue of protection, Mr Gulvin pointed out that the opinion now  at
    hand from the Honorary  Legal  Advisor  to  the  British  Consulate  in
    Algiers said that decisions should be made "on a case by  case  basis".
    The Algerian authorities would know, he submitted,  that  the  claimant
    was married to a national of Algeria; that she had three  children  who
    were also nationals of Algeria; that as the spouse  of  a  national  of
    Algeria she had a route for applying to reside there, if  not  also  to
    become in time naturalised as Algerian herself; that she had  lived  in
    Algeria for some nine months; and that (contrary to her own claims) she
    had not experienced  any  difficulties  previously  with  the  Algerian
    authorities.  If Algeria did make a request of  Syria  for  information
    about her, that would only reveal that she  was  someone  who  (on  the
    unchallenged findings of the IJ) had no political profile  of  her  own
    and that at most that she was only the family member of someone with  a
    political profile.  Further, the co-operation agreements between  Syria
    and Algeria dealing with extradition  and  deportation  were  concerned
    with either criminals or  terrorists;  there  was  no  suggestion  this
    claimant fell into either of these categories.

27.   Miss Appiah's submission in response was that the claimant  could  not
    be  returned  to  Algeria  because  she  would  face  a  real  risk  of
    persecution there and she had no prospect of obtaining  the  protection
    of that country.  In relation to the issue of  protection,  she  argued
    that not only was it a fact that  the  claimant  had  no  passport,  no
    entitlement to  Algerian  citizenship  and  no  significant  period  of
    residence in Algeria, but the Secretary of  State  had  stated  at  the
    hearing that he had "no evidence to place before me to seek to  satisfy
    me that the appellant had any prospect whatsoever of obtaining entry to
    Algeria."

28.   The Tribunal should attach particular weight, added  Miss  Appiah,  to
    the further evidence now to hand, in particular that from the  Honorary
    Legal Advisor to the British Embassy in Algiers.  This, she  said,  had
    twofold significance.  First, it strongly suggested that it would be  a
    breach of Article 33 to return the claimant to Algeria as the  claimant
    would be at risk there of indirect refoulement to  Syria.  Co-operation
    agreements between the two countries cover security aspects and, in the
    Honorary Advisor's own words, "Algeria would in this context, hand over
    opponents to the Syrian regime". Second, on the basis of this  person's
    evidence, the claimant would not be able to succeed in  an  application
    for Algerian nationality by naturalisation as the spouse of an Algerian
    national because she had not had the necessary period of  residence  in
    Algeria of at least two years.  Normally, as  a  Syrian  national,  she
    would need a visa to enter Algeria (she had not  needed  one  when  she
    entered previously on a Syrian passport albeit a false one), but as she
    did not now have a Syrian passport she  could  not  benefit  from  this
    facility. If, as it appears would be the case, she were  to  travel  to
    Algeria on a travel document issued  by  the  UK,  then  she  would  be
    subject to an entry visa requirement.  Whilst issuance of such  a  visa
    in such circumstances is made on a "case by case basis", the process is
    lengthy and it  was  certainly  more  difficult  than  a  normal  visa.
    Depending on the circumstances of the case her application  could  also
    be the subject of a request by the Algerian authorities to her  country
    of origin for information.

29.   Miss Appiah said it was important when considering  how  the  Algerian
    and Syrian authorities would perceive  the  claimant  after  consulting
    with each other to bear in mind that although the  IJ  disbelieved  the
    claimant's account of adverse experiences in Algeria, he  had  accepted
    she had relied on false Syrian and Mali passports.

Our Assessment

30.   We must, of course,  decide  the  appeal  on  the  basis  of  all  the
    evidence, not only that which was before the IJ,  but  that  which  has
    been furnished (in accordance  with  Tribunal  directions)  since.   It
    seems to us that considered as a whole this evidence demonstrates  that
    the claimant would face a real risk of persecution in  Algeria  against
    which she would not receive effective protection.  The  following  seem
    to us to be of particular importance:

         (a)       First, there is the claimant's father's accepted history.
         The IJ  considered  that  the  account  given  of  the  appellant's
         father's history was credible.  Her father had lived as a political
         exile in Yemen.  Before that, he and his family had  spent  periods
         of time in Turkey, Iraq and  Jordan.   In  Jordan  the  family  was
         forced to leave when the authorities  there  became  aware  of  the
         father's antipathy to the Syrian government.  Her father  had  also
         written a book (entitled Fil Qaa) condemning the brutality  of  the
         Syrian regime.


         (b) Second, there is the evidence that the Syrian  regime  targeted
         family  members  of  political  dissidents,  as   appears   to   be
         illustrated by what had happened to the appellant's sister, who was
         imprisoned on return to Algeria


         (c)       Next there is  the  claimant's  history  of  using  false
         passports.  Whilst not accepting that the claimant had  encountered
         any problems with the Algerian authorities, the IJ did  not  reject
         her evidence that she had made use of false passports and  that  in
         1999, when she submitted her Syrian passport for extension of leave
         in Ghana, the authorities in Ghana became aware that that  passport
         was forged.  This history was likely to increase the prospects that
         the claimant's  name  would  be  on  records  held  by  the  Syrian
         authorities.


         (d) There is also evidence from the Syrian Human  Rights  Committee
         about the reach of Syrian intelligence activities  indicating  that
         the Syrian authorities take a close interest in  Syrian  dissidents
         residing in other countries in the Middle East and Africa.


         (e)      Then there is the evidence relating  to  Algeria's  record
         regarding refugees. According to the US Department of State  report
         on Algeria for  2007  (11  March  2008)  UNHCR  reported  that  the
         government did not accept UNHCR determined refugee  status  for  28
         individuals from Sub-Saharan Africa.  This group  was  returned  to
         Mali at a border in the middle of  a  conflict  zone  -  they  were
         deported without trial and without legal Counsel.  Further, in  the
         same report there were  no  reports  that  the  government  granted
         refugee status and asylum during that year.


         (f)      In addition, there is the further evidence before us  from
         the Syrian Human Rights Committee ("SHRC")  in  a  letter  dated  9
         February 2009 stating that it had recorded  "several  incidents  in
         which the Algerian authorities have  handed  over  members  of  the
         Syrian Muslim Brotherhood to the Syrian authorities".   The  letter
         describes cases from 1982 (involving eight Syrian teachers  working
         in Algeria), 1987 (involving a Mr Sami Alawi) and  2001  (involving
         Mr Waleed Saleem).  All met with serious harm in  Syria  except  Mr
         Saleem who managed to escape.  On the strength of these  cases  the
         SHRC stated that it believed,  the  claimant's  repatriation  would
         "pose dangerous implications on her safety and  freedom".  Although
         this item of evidence did not identify any cases since 2001,  there
         was no evidence to suggest any significant change in  how  the  two
         countries would react to similar cases if they arose now.


         (g)      Perhaps the most telling item of evidence  is  that  which
         the Secretary of State in fact produced in response  to  directions
         from the Tribunal seeking her assistance in  obtaining  information
         from the Algerian Embassy.  The Secretary  of  State  was  able  to
         obtain an opinion from an Honorary Legal Advisor  to  the  Algerian
         Embassy which noted that co-operation agreements  between  the  two
         countries covered security aspects and, in the  Honorary  Advisor's
         own words, "Algeria would in this context, hand over  opponents  of
         the Syrian  regime".   Given  the  appellant's  family  profile  we
         consider it reasonably likely that the claimant could  be  seen  to
         fall under such agreements.


31.   In the light of the above we consider that there exists in  this  case
    a real risk to the claimant  of  indirect  (or  chain)  refoulement  by
    Algeria to Syria.  Algeria would not be for her a safe  third  country.
    Such a risk would make her removal to Algeria in  direct  contravention
    of Article 33(1) of the Refugee  Convention  and  so  contrary  to  the
    United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention.  Removal  to
    Algeria would also violate her Article 3 ECHR rights.

32.   For the above reasons:

The Immigration Judge materially erred in law.

The decision we remake is to allow the appeal of the claimant on asylum  and
Article 3 ECHR grounds.
