Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs Pettersen (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the  respondent  is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant, born September 19, 1988 is a  citizen  of  Pakistan.  He
    entered the United Kingdom as a student on January 21, 2010 with  leave
    to remain until July 31, 2011. He was granted further leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) student until December 31, 2012 and on  March  7,
    2013 he was granted further leave to remain until October 30, 2013.  On
    October 30, 2013 he applied for further leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) student but this was refused on December 4, 2013  because  he
    failed to demonstrate he held the correct amount of funds in  the  bank
    statements he had submitted. A decision to remove him under section  47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and nationality Act 2006 was also taken.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  on  December  19,
    2013.  On  May  23,  2014  Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Smith
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") heard his  appeal.  He  allowed
    the appeal under both the Immigration Rules and article  8  ECHR  in  a
    determination promulgated on June 6, 2014.

 4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on June 13, 2014  and  on  July
    22, 2014 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Page  granted  permission  to
    appeal finding it arguable the FtTJ had erred by admitting a  new  bank
    statement as further evidence and allowing it under article 8 ECHR.

 5. The appellant did not file a Rule 24 response and was notified  of  the
    hearing date on September 23, 2014. He had not attended by 2.20pm  when
    I called the case on and for the record he had not attended by 5pm that
    day.

    SUBMISSIONS


 6. Mrs Pettersen adopted the grounds of appeal and submitted:


      a. The FtTJ erred in his approach. The  appellant  had  submitted  his
         application on October 25, 2013 and in line with paragraph 1A(h) of
         Appendix C of the Immigration Rules the appellant has to provide  a
         bank statement where the end of the 28 day period will be taken  as
         the date of the  closing  balance  on  the  most  recent  specified
         document and must be no earlier than 31 days before the date of the
         application.


      b. The appellant had to demonstrate he had in his account funds for 28
         consecutive days prior to the date of the application, which  would
         mean September 27, 2013. This was a Tier 4 application  so  Section
         85A of the 2002 Act applied to documents submitted later. The  FtTJ
         erred by admitting a later bank statement because this  was  not  a
         case covered by paragraph 245AA of the  Immigration  Rules  because
         the respondent had the specified  document  before  him.  The  FtTJ
         erred  by  admitting  the  document  and  erred  by  allowing   the
         application under the Immigration Rules.


      c. He further erred by  allowing  the  appeal  under  article  8.  The
         decision of Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC)
         makes clear that article 8 ECHR should not  be  used  to  enable  a
         student to remain to complete his studies if  there  are  no  other
         factors to consider. The  FtTJ  therefore  erred  by  allowing  the
         appeal.


    MY FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

 7. The appellant did not attend the hearing and it may well  be,  although
    it was not confirmed, that he  has  already  left  the  country  as  he
    originally claimed he only wanted to extend his  stay  until  September
    2014 to complete his paper.


 8.  I am satisfied that both grounds of appeal have merit.

 9. In respect of the FtTJ's decision to admit a subsequent bank  statement
    this was contrary to Section 85A of the 2002 that limits the Tribunal's
    discretion to admit further documents. This was not a  case  where  the
    respondent  or  the  Tribunal  should  have  applied   any   evidential
    flexibility. This was not a missing  statement  because  the  statement
    provided covered the requisite period. It simply did  not  satisfy  the
    Rules because there as  a  three  day  shortfall.  The  FtTJ  erred  in
    admitting this document and I therefore set aside that  aspect  of  the
    decision.

10. With regard to the  allowing  of  the  appeal  under  article  8  I  am
    satisfied the appellant's only private life was his studies.  He  would
    not satisfy paragraph 276ADE and following the decision in Nasim  I  am
    satisfied there was no reason to consider this appeal  outside  of  the
    Rules. The Tribunal made clear at paragraph [21] of Nasim  extending  a
    student's leave under article 8 for purposes of study or work "lies  at
    the outer reaches of cases  requiring  an  affirmative  answer  to  the
    second of the five  "Razgar"  questions  and  that,  even  if  such  an
    affirmative answer needs to be given, the issue of  proportionality  is
    to be resolved decisively in favour of the respondent, by reference  to
    her functions as the guardian of the system  of  immigration  controls,
    entrusted to her by Parliament."

11. The FtTJ had nothing before him that should have led to the leave being
    extended and he should  have  dismissed  the  appeal  on  private  life
    grounds under the Rules and there were  no  exceptional  or  compelling
    circumstances that would make removal unjustifiably harsh.

12. In the circumstances I find the FtTJ erred  in  both  elements  of  his
    assessment.

13. The appellant did not meet the Rules and I dismiss his appeal under the
    Immigration Rules and I further set aside the decision under article  8
    ECHR and find  the  appellant's  private  life  appeal  is  covered  by
    paragraph 276ADE, which the appellant cannot meet.

    DECISION


14. There was a material error of law in so far  as  both  the  Immigration
    Rules and article 8 ECHR are concerned. I set aside both decisions  and
    I dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


15. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
