                           (anonymity order made)
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    respondent in this determination  identified  as  ASB.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings

      1. FtT Judge S Y Loke dismissed ASB's appeal against  the  refusal  of
         his international protection and human rights claim for reasons set
         out in a decision promulgated on 19th  March  2020.  Permission  to
         appeal was granted by FtT judge Mark  Davies  on  7th  April  2020.
         Directions for the further conduct of the appeal were sent  on  3rd
         July 2020 and, in the circumstances surrounding COVID 19, provision
         was made for the question of whether there was an error of law  and
         if so whether the decision of the FtT Judge should be set aside  to
         be determined on the papers.

      2. The respondent complied with  directions  and  stated  he  did  not
         request an oral hearing. The  SSHD  neither  made  submissions  nor
         identified whether she objected to a decision being  taken  on  the
         papers and nor did  she  request  an  extension  of  time  to  make
         submissions. Although the  grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal
         requested an oral hearing there was no  indication  in  the  papers
         before me that  the  appellant  maintained  that  position  or  the
         reasons for that position.

      3. I  am  satisfied  that  the  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the
         respondent together with the papers before me[1] are sufficient  to
         enable me to be able to take a decision  on  whether  there  is  an
         error of law in the decision of the  FtT  and  if  so  whether  the
         decision should be set aside, on the  papers  and  without  hearing
         oral submissions.

      4. The SSHD sought and was granted permission to appeal on the  ground
         that it was arguable (a) that the FtT judge erred in law in finding
         that s72 did not apply; and (b) that the FtT judge erred in finding
         that there were insurmountable obstacles to  ASB  integrating  into
         the DRC and that because one of the two  exceptions  was  not  made
         out, the judge erred in therefore the decision that there were very
         compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  exceptions  was
         flawed.

         Ground 1

      5. This ground is misconceived. The appellant did not pursue an appeal
         on the grounds that he was a refugee but on Article 3 and  8  only.
         The FtT judge referred to s72 not being of relevance but  proceeded
         to consider whether ASB had rebutted the presumption. The judge set
         out the correct jurisprudential  framework  and  the  evidence  she
         considered. The  SSHD  refers  to  the  crimes  being  particularly
         serious and submits the judge failed to take into account that  the
         appellant had failed to demonstrate remorse.

      6. The judge unhesitatingly found that ASB had committed  particularly
         serious crimes. In  reaching  her  conclusion  that  he  no  longer
         presents a danger to society  and  rebutted  the  presumption,  she
         refers to all the matters she took into account including his  role
         as a mentor and positive  role  model  to  young  people  to  avoid
         descending into crime. It is difficult to understand on what  basis
         the mere lack of a statement of remorse is such as to undermine the
         judge's findings. The  Ben  Kinsella  Trust  with  whom  ASB  works
         closely and from whom he had an  excellent  reference  has  as  its
         purpose the education of young people  about  the  consequences  of
         choices, so they stay safe and away from crime. The issue  of  lack
         of remorse was not put to ASB by the SSHD although ASB's actions in
         any event speak louder than words of remorse could.

      7. The judge has not erred in law in finding that the s72  certificate
         is of no relevance given that ASB was not pursuing a refugee  claim
         but in any event her findings that ASB has rebutted the presumption
         were  findings  that  were  open  to  her  on  the  evidence,  were
         adequately reasoned and sustainable. The SSHD is simply disagreeing
         with the conclusion reached.

         Ground 2

      8. The SSHD submits the judge diluted the elevated threshold  required
         to be met; that "mere hardship, mere hurdles and mere  upheaval  or
         inconvenience   even   where   multiplied,   will   generally    be
         insufficient".  She submits the matters  considered  by  the  judge
         whether in isolation or cumulatively  did  not  meet  the  required
         elevated  threshold,  that  the  judge  failed  to  identify   "any
         obstacles that would reach  the  definition  of  very  significant,
         [ASB] would face the same challenges that the majority of deportees
         would face and therefore  these  should  not  be  classed  as  very
         significant obstacles." The SSHD submits that the judge  failed  to
         consider the connection ASB has to the DRC through his  parents  or
         that his family could assist with reintegration and failed to  take
         account of the �1500 resettlement funds he would receive; erred  in
         law in factoring in that he had not committed further offences. The
         SSHD submits that because ASB did not meet one of  the  Exceptions,
         the finding that there were very compelling circumstances above and
         beyond was legally flawed.

      9. The judge did consider the �1500 fund that  the  respondent  states
         would be provided, although because ASB has exercised his right  of
         statutory appeal it is unclear that he would in fact receive this.

     10. The SSHD is incorrect in the submission that one  or  both  of  the
         Exceptions have to be met before consideration of whether there are
         very compelling circumstances can be considered. Although that  may
         be the case generally it is not a necessity - see  Akinyemi  [2017]
         EWCA Civ 236.

     11. The judge fully appreciated the seriousness  of  ASB's  criminality
         and gave significant weight to the public interest. She utilised  a
         'balance sheet' approach and lawfully considered the whole of ASB's
         circumstances, in  the  round,  in  the  context  of  that  serious
         criminality and the weight placed  upon  that.  Her  findings  were
         rational and adequately reasoned.

     12. The judge has not erred in law.

         Conclusion

     13. The decision read as a whole is not infected by error of  law  such
         that it is to be set aside to be remade. That the SSHD considers  a
         different conclusion should have been reached does not  render  the
         judge's decision infected by errors of law. She gave  rational  and
         sustainable reasons for finding that  ASB's  deportation  would  be
         disproportionate.







    Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set aside the decision; the decision of the FtT judge allowing
    the appeal stands.




    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an  order  pursuant  to  rule  13  of  the
    Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and   Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014.

    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
