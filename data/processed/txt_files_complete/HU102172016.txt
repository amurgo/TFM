Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Harding of Counsel, instructed by G Singh
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals against a decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which dismissed his appeal, on all grounds, against a decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to deport him from the United  Kingdom  to  Nigeria.
    The deportation  order  was  made  pursuant  to  Section  5(1)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971 and was on the basis that  his  presence  was  not
    conducive to the public good.  The Secretary of  State  relied  on  the
    appellant's convictions, specifically two counts of theft for which  he
    was convicted at Kingston Crown Court on 30th March 2005 and  sentenced
    to 42 months' imprisonment.

         "28.     ...

             (1) two counts of theft for which the Appellant was  convicted
                  at the Kingston Crown Court on the  30th  March  2005  and
                  sentenced to 42 months imprisonment.

             (2) On 25th July 1975 at Snaresbrook Crown  Court  convictions
                  for theft, forgery  of  valuable  security,  forgery,  two
                  counts of uttering forged documents and obtaining goods by
                  forged instrument, 12 months prison sentence suspended for
                  two years.

             (3) Convicted on the 21st January 1977  at  the  Inner  London
                  Crown Court for seven counts of uttering forged  documents
                  and breach of suspended sentence, for which he received  a
                  9 month prison sentence suspended for two years.

             (4) Convicted on the 3rd June 2003 at Tower Bridge Magistrates
                  Court for driving with excess alcohol sentenced to a  fine
                  of �175 and cost �50."

 2. The grounds for permission to appeal asserted that the  judge  rejected
    the expert report of Dr Mala Singh,  dated  27th  March  2017,  on  the
    question of whether the appellant suffered from  dementia.   The  judge
    did not consider that the expert had seen the  earlier  September  2016
    and  October  2016  medical  reports  and   as   such   this   omission
    "significantly compromised" the expert report.

 3. Mr Simon Harding, at the hearing before me, stated that this was not  a
    matter raised at issue in the hearing although I pointed out  that  the
    report  of  Dr  Singh  was  in   fact   served   by   the   appellant's
    representatives and that they would be well aware of the  content  (and
    any limitations) of the report.  There was ambiguity in the  report  as
    to what records were considered by the expert.

Conclusions

 4. The judge had this to say at paragraphs 68 and 69:

         "68.     Dr Singh refers to the sources of information s/he had as,
             'medical records made available to me', (she  does  not  state
             what these records were), her assessment of the Appellant, the
             letter of instruction  and  to  receiving  'corroborate  (sic)
             information from the son'.  I do not know which  of  the  Sons
             attended the appointment with Dr Singh.

         69.      However I note  that  Dr  Singh  does  not  refer  to  the
             September Report or assessment or to the October Report in her
             report.  This I find surprising because I  conclude  that  the
             October Report does not support a diagnosis  of  dementia  and
             provides relevant information  as  to  that  conclusion  -  in
             particular the MRI  scan.   I  find  the  MRI  scan  to  be  a
             significant diagnostic tool, I conclude so  from  the  October
             Report and the matters to which I have referred  to  above  at
             paragraphs 61 and 66.  Dr  Singh  does  not  report  obtaining
             his/her own MRI scan and therefore I conclude failed  to  have
             this significant diagnostic information."

 5. At paragraph 71 the judge, explored whether Dr Singh had a copy of  the
    September and October reports from the Memory  Service,  and  concluded
    finally that Dr Singh did not have the report.  That was an error.   Dr
    Singh referred to "medical records made available to me"  and  on  that
    basis it was not open to the judge to conclude, as he did at  paragraph
    71, that:

         "I am not satisfied therefore that Dr Singh had all the recent  and
         relevant medical records relating to  the  appellant.   I  conclude
         that Dr Singh undertook his/her  assessment  relying  significantly
         upon the appellant's and or the son's account.  In this regard  the
         reference by Dr Singh to 'corroborate information from the son',  I
         conclude to be, so far as the appellant's ability to meet his daily
         living activities, to be a reference to the son  corroborating  the
         appellant's account.  As such I am not satisfied that Dr Singh  was
         aware that the appellant was meeting his own daily living needs and
         working five days a week in September 2016."

 6. This conclusion by the judge, which was an error of fact, which led  to
    an error of law, as those reports were  indeed  before  the  expert  as
    confirmed by him.

 7. The judge continued in the decision to  accept  that  people  suffering
    from dementia could develop and  deteriorate  quickly  but  nonetheless
    appeared to reduce significantly the  weight  attached  to  Dr  Singh's
    report because of the lack of reference to the  September  and  October
    reports.  As Mr Harding pointed out and Mr Walker at the hearing before
    me agreed,  Dr Singh was indeed a psychiatrist and the dismissal of his
    report on the basis that it was rejected was inadequate.

 8. I note that although the judge pointed out  that  the  expert  did  not
    refer to anxiety or depression or dementia as an expertise,  the  judge
    was content that the doctor was able to  diagnose  conditions  such  as
    dementia [67].  Further the September and  October  2016  reports  were
    compiled by a community practitioner from the South London and Maudsley
    NHS not from a Consultant Psychiatrist,  as  Dr  Singh  is,  and  whose
    opinion was thus rejected without adequate reasoning.

 9. Mr Harding submitted that the consideration of the report went  to  the
    root of the findings in relation to the sons' evidence.  As  such  this
    would affect the further findings in relation to proportionality.    At
    the hearing before me Mr Walker conceded that there was indeed an error
    of law in the decision which was material and which ran to the heart of
    the findings.  I agree.

10. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
