Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.    The Appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 29th January  1994.  She
      appeals against the determination of the First-tier Tribunal dated 5th
      March 2014 dismissing her appeal against the Respondent's decision  of
      27th November 2012  to refuse entry clearance as the fiancï¿½ of  Albert
      Mustali,  the  Sponsor,  under  paragraphs  320(7A)  and  290  of  the
      Immigration Rules.



2.     Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Cruthers on 11th April 2014 on the grounds  that  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Devittie arguably erred in law in failing to make a  finding  on
      paragraph 320(7A) and the  Judge  had  not  adequately  explained  his
      reasons for rejecting the Appellant's claim  to  have  a  genuine  and
      subsisting relationship with the Sponsor.

3.    At the hearing before me, Ms Panagiotopoulou adopted  the  grounds  of
      appeal and submitted that the Judge had failed  to  make  findings  on
      paragraph 320(7A), having refused the Respondent's application for  an
      adjournment  to  obtain  translations.  The  case  had  already   been
      adjourned on this basis on a previous occasion. The Judge  had  failed
      to give adequate reasons for finding that the Appellant was not  in  a
      genuine and  subsisting  relationship  and,  given  the  abundance  of
      documentary evidence, the Judge's decision was perverse.

4.    Ms Panagiotopoulou submitted that there were also  factual  errors  in
      the Judge's findings at paragraph 9(i)  and  (iii).  The  Sponsor  had
      given the name of the person at whose wedding he met the Appellant and
      the Judge had  failed  to  take  into  account  the  second  time  the
      Appellant met the Sponsor in a village (question 44 of the Appellant's
      interview). The documentary evidence  could  only  have  lead  to  one
      conclusion and the Judge had failed to give adequate reasons  for  why
      it did not satisfy him.

5.    Mr Whitwell relied on the Rule 24  response  and  submitted  that,  at
      paragraph 9, the Judge found that there were unsatisfactory aspects to
      the evidence of the Appellant and the Sponsor  and  he  gave  adequate
      reasons for his decision. The documentary evidence was limited;  there
      were photographs, but few specified dates; the Sponsor  had  travelled
      to Albania on several occasions, but there was no evidence to show  he
      had visited the Appellant; the telephone records did not show that the
      Sponsor made calls to the Appellant. It was clear from the Appellant's
      interview that she wanted to get to the UK  first  before  considering
      the issue of marriage. The interview supported the Judge's findings at
      paragraph 9(ii) that no wedding plans had been made.  The  grounds  of
      appeal amounted to disagreements with the Judge's findings and did not
      disclose an  error  of  law.  The  factual  errors  relied  upon  were
      immaterial.

6.    Mr Whitwell accepted that the Judge had erred in  law  in  falling  to
      make findings on  paragraph  320(7A)  and  submitted  that  there  was
      sufficient evidence for me to remake the decision. The Respondent  had
      discharged the burden of proof.

7.    Ms Panagiotopoulou submitted that the decision could be remade on  the
      evidence before me today. The Sponsor had made a statement in relation
      to paragraph 320(7A) on the basis of the untranslated  documents.  His
      explanation was sufficient to rebut Respondent's assertion. The  Judge
      had failed to make clear findings on the oral evidence of the  Sponsor
      and had failed to identify any  unsatisfactory  feature.  On  balance,
      there was  ample  evidence  to  establish  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship.

Discussion and conclusions

8.    I find that the Judge erred in law in failing to  make  a  finding  on
      paragraph 320(7A). The email submitted by the Respondent  stated  that
      the Sponsor was not registered in the Civil Status Office  in  Kosovo.
      The Internal Ministry of Albania confirmed that an Albert Mustali with
      a different date of birth was an Albanian national who had not applied
      for an identify card.

9.    The Sponsor stated that the person referred to in the letter from  the
      Interior Ministry was not him because the date of birth was  different
      and the parents names were different. The Kosovo  authorities  had  no
      influence in Zvecan which was still under the influence of the Serbian
      authorities. There was background evidence supporting this claim.

10.   On the evidence before me, I find that the Respondent  has  failed  to
      show that the Sponsor has used a false document  in  the  application.
      The email was not authenticated and its provenance was unclear.  There
      was insufficient evidence to establish the assertions in  the  refusal
      notice. The Respondent has  failed  to  show  that  paragraph  320(7A)
      applied.

11.   The Judge found that there were  several  unsatisfactory  features  in
      the evidence of the Appellant and  the  Sponsor,  all  of  which  when
      considered in their totality,  pointed  to  the  conclusion  that  the
      Appellant  had  not  shown  that  the  relationship  was  genuine  and
      subsisting. This finding was open to the Judge on the evidence  before
      him for the reasons set out below.

12.   The evidence of how the parties met was vague. There were  no  details
      of the wedding they both attended, save that the Sponsor gave the name
      of his friend during oral evidence. The Appellant's interview and  the
      Sponsor's statement failed to supply this information or to  give  any
      other details of the wedding.

13.   All but four photographs were undated. The Facebook messages were  not
      translated save for 31st May, 8th June and 1st December 2012  and  9th
      June 2013. I accept that it was not cost effective to  translate  them
      all, but the  Judge  could  not  be  expected  to  place  reliance  on
      documents which were not translated.

14.   The telephone records did not show that the Sponsor  was  calling  the
      Appellant because there was no evidence to  show  what  her  telephone
      number was. The Sponsor claimed to have bought her  a  'pay-as-you-go'
      telephone so that she could call him at a reduced rate. There  was  no
      documentary evidence to support this and no evidence of any  telephone
      calls from the Appellant to the Sponsor. The top up receipts at  pages
      451 and 452 of the Appellant's bundle post-dated the decision and  did
      not identify who was using the telephone or to whom calls were made.




15.   The Sponsor had visited Albania on several occasions, but  the  stamps
      in his passport and his air tickets were insufficient to show that the
      Sponsor visited the Appellant.

16.   The factual errors referred to in submissions  were  not  material  to
      the decision. The description of how the parties met  was  lacking  in
      detail and the Sponsor made no mention of the second  meeting  in  the
      village, to which the Appellant referred in her interview at  question
      44.

17.   The Judge's reasons were set out at paragraph 9. They were  consistent
      with the Appellant's  interview  and  the  evidence  before  him.  The
      reasons were adequate to  support  his  overall  findings.  The  Judge
      considered the evidence  in  the  round  and  his  findings  were  not
      perverse.

18.   The Judge made no error on any point of law which  might  require  the
      determination to be set aside. The appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
      dismissed.  The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  dated  shall
      stand.
