Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Paul Turner instructed by Lee Valley Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr John McGirr, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Samimi,  dismissing  his  appeal   against   the
    respondent's refusal to grant him a residence permit  as  the  extended
    family member of his EEA citizen cousin.

 2. At paragraph 7 the judge set out serious concerns about the evidence of
    the sponsor as to his  finances  but  at  paragraph  10  he  fell  into
    significant error when he said this:

         "There is no evidence of the Appellant  having  been  supported  by
         [the sponsor] Mr [E] in  2010.   I  do  not  find  that  the  money
         transfer receipts provide credible  evidence  of  prior  dependency
         given that there are only  five  Western  Union  transfer  receipts
         relating to January/March and June 2011  and  August  and  November
         2012."

 3. At pages 21-25 of the appellant's bundle, he had  disclosed  5  further
    Western Union transfer receipts sent by Mr [E] to one [MH] amounting to
    a total sum of  Rs  1,202,021  (about  ï¿½9134  sterling),  a  record  of
    payments made on 10 August 2010 - 25 August 2010, 1 September 2010 -  5
    October 2010 and on 15 December 2010.  At the Upper  Tribunal  hearing,
    the appellant stated that [MH] is his father and  that  the  money  was
    sent for his support in Pakistan.

 4. It was therefore incorrect in fact to say that there was 'no  evidence'
    of payments made for the applicant's support in 2010.  The existence of
    the 2010 Western Union receipts  raises  questions  which  may  require
    further oral evidence.  I do not consider it  appropriate  to  seek  to
    remake the decision in this appeal today.

 5. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The decision will
    be remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
