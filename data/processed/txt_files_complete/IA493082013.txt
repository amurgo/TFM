Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Presenting Officer


                             DECISION AND REASON




      1. The appellant is a national of India. He was granted leave to enter
         the United Kingdom as Tier 4 (General Student) on 11 November  2010
         which was valid  until  21  September  2012.  His  application  for
         further leave to remain as Tier 4 (General Student) was refused  on
         14 November  2013  on  the  ground  that  the  respondent  was  not
         satisfied that  the  applicant  had  demonstrated  availability  of
         maintenance funds for 28 consecutive days  prior  to  the  date  of
         application. Reference was  made  to  Paragraph  1  A  (h)  of  the
         Appendix C of Immigration Rules.


      2. The appellant's appeal was heard by Judge James,  a  Judge  of  the
         First Tier Tribunal on 23 July 2014  at  Hatton  Cross.  The  Judge
         dismissed the appeal. In the  course  of  hearing  submissions  the
         Judge noted the HOPO's confirmation that further research had shown
         that the loan issued to the appellant had been made by a designated
         bank under the rules and guidance. However in dismissing the appeal
         Judge rejected the argument advanced on  behalf  of  the  appellant
         that as the guidance issued for  Appendix  C  refers  to  the  time
         period of 28 days for all other funds, and not for loans, it  means
         that the designated sum is not required to be held for 28  days  if
         it is a loan.


      3. The appellant sought and was granted permission to  appeal  to  the
         Upper Tribunal by Designated First-Tier Tribunal Judge Zucker on 15
         September 2014. In granting permission the Judge said, "The grounds
         include the submission that the decision of the Respondent was  not
         in accordance with  the  law,  because  it  was  made  against  the
         Respondent's own stated policy as set out in the  Policy  Guidance.
         It is submitted that as the Appellant was relying on a loan, he did
         not need to  demonstrate  that  the  funds  were  actually  in  his
         account, only that there was no condition to the release  of  funds
         other than the application being successful."


      4. At the hearing before me Mr Nath contended that  as  the  loan  was
         available as from 3 August 2013, the appellant  did  not  meet  the
         requirement under Paragraph 1 A  (h)  of  the  Appendix  C  of  the
         Immigration Rules and therefore the decision of Judge James was not
         in material error of law.


      5. Mr Hawkin argued that such interpretation is  not  consistent  with
         facts as well as logic. He pointed out  that  the  application  was
         made on 21 August. The loan had become available as from  3  August
         2013 and 28 days from 3 August meant that the appellant should have
         had the funds on 1 September reminding me that the date of decision
         was 14 November 2013. He asked that the decision of Judge James  be
         reversed and that the appeal be allowed.


      6. I reserved my decision which I now  give.  The  contention  of  the
         appellant that sub-para (d) of paragraph 1B  of  Appendix  C  which
         concerns applicants applying as a Tier 4 Migrant relying on a  loan
         letter from a designated financial institution makes  no  reference
         to the 28 day period but simply requires that the  loan  letter  is
         dated "no more than 6 months before the date of the application" is
         in my view well founded and logical. The rationale of  the  28  day
         period does not apply where maintenance requirement is supported by
         loan from a designated financial institution.  Such  interpretation
         makes good sense and takes care of any potential mischief. Also  in
         any event in this case the appellant's loan letter meant  that  the
         funds had been available to him for a 28 day period by the time  of
         the respondent's impugned decision.


      7. Accordingly the decision of Judge James is set aside  as  being  in
         material error of law and in remaking the decision this  appeal  is
         allowed for the reasons given above.

    TO THE RESPONDENT
    FEE AWARD


         As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee  has  been  paid,  I
         have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a whole
         fee award of ï¿½140.00 which has been paid for the  following  reason
         as the impugned decision has been found to have no real merit.
