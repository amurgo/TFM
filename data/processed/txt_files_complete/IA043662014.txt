Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Rashid Mahmood


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Howard in which  he  allowed
    the respondent's appeal against a decision made on 6 November  2013  to
    refuse to vary his leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant. The judge relied on Rodriguez [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC) to allow
    the respondent's appeal.

2.   The Secretary of State was granted  permission  to  appeal  on  grounds
    which argued that the judge made a material  misdirection  in  law,  in
    particular by relying on the case of Rodriguez [2013] UKUT 00042  which
    has now been set aside by the Court of Appeal in Rodriguez [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 2.

3.   The judge correctly recognised at paragraph  10  of  the  determination
    that this case concerns the evidence submitted to show the availability
    of �50,000.  The requirement for that amount is found in  Appendix   A.
    Appendix A requires the letter to meet the prescribed  requirements  of
    paragraphs 41-SD.  Paragraph 41-SD(b)(i)  requires  that  the  original
    declaration from the third party contains inter alia  "the  applicant's
    signature and the signature of the third party".  The  judge  said  the
    affidavit he had contained the signature of the third  party,  but  not
    that of the appellant.

4.   The judge said at paragraph 11  that  paragraph  41-SD(b)(ii)  requires
    that there is a letter from the  legal  representative  confirming  the
    validity of the signatures on the third  party  declaration.   In  this
    case there was no letter but the affidavit, which is  the  third  party
    declaration,  and  which  contains  all  the  information  required  by
    paragraph 41-SD(b)(ii) save that it cannot attest to the  signature  of
    the respondent because it is not thereon.

5.   Mr Wilding said that there was a further issue which, the judge  failed
    to consider and it is this; at page  2  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    refusal letter, it states that the respondent  i.e. claimant has stated
    that he has access to funds of �50,000  being  made  available  to  his
    business by Mr  Mohamed  Zariat.   As  evidence  of  this  he  provided
    Barclays Bank statements and a  declaration  from  Mr  Mohamed  Zariat.
    However the bank statements that he had provided  were  not  acceptable
    because they were for an account that was not in the  claimant's  name,
    as required by paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii) and (iv) of  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  For money held in the UK, the account  must  be  in
    the appellant's own name only, not in the name of a business  or  third
    party.

6.   Mr Wilding submitted that the judge did not deal with this issue.

7.   Mr.  Mahmood  confirmed  that  the  Barclays  Bank  statements  he  had
    submitted with his application were not in his name. They were  in  the
    name of his father, Mr Mohamed Zariat.  Consequently on  this  issue  I
    find that Mr. Mahmood's appeal could not succeed.

8.   However, there were other requirements Mr. Mahmood had  to  meet  given
    that the Barclays Bank statements were in the name of his  father,  the
    third party.  The  requirements  were  as  set  out  by  the  judge  at
    paragraphs 10 and 11 of the determination, as recorded above.

9.   Mr. Mahmood confirmed that  the  affidavit  from  his  father  did  not
    contain his signature.   His explanation was that he forgot to sign it.
     He had expected that the Secretary of State would  write  to   him  so
    that he could  remedy the defect.

10.   Mr.  Mahmood  said  he  submitted   a   declaration   from   a   legal
    representative to establish that the letter of permission supplied  was
    valid.  However, as the third party letter of support did  not  contain
    his signature, the letter from the legal representative did not confirm
    his signature.  Mr Wilding submitted that the further letter  from  the
    legal representative dated January 2014  post-dated  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision and the date of the claimant's application.

11.  I find on the evidence that was before the judge and confirmed  by  Mr.
    Mahmood at the hearing before me, that his appeal  could  not  succeed.
    The judge applied the wrong authority i.e. Rodriguez [2013] UKUT  00042
    which had been set aside by the Court of Appeal in  their  decision  in
    Rodriguez EWCA Civ [2014].  The Court of Appeal did not uphold  any  of
    the findings made by the Upper Tribunal.

12.  I find that had the judge applied the Court of  Appeal's  decision,  he
    would not on the evidence before  him  have  allowed  the  respondent's
    appeal.

13.  Accordingly, the judge's decision cannot stand.

14.  I remake the decision and dismiss Mr. Mahmood's appeal.

16.  It follows that the Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.
