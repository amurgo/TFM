                           MR MICHAEL GEORGE BOYD

                                                                  Respondent


    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Mr P Deller a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
          For the Respondent: Mr J Ren� of counsel instructed by
Hetheringtons

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department.  I
      will refer to her as the Secretary  of  State.  The  respondent  is  a
      citizen of Jamaica who was born on 1 June 1987. I will refer to him as
      the claimant.


   2. The Secretary of  State  has  been  given  permission  to  appeal  the
      determination of a panel (First-Tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell and  non-
      legal member Dr P L Ravenscroft) who  allowed  the  claimant's  appeal
      against the Secretary of State's decision of 2 April 2013  to  make  a
      deportation order under s 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.


   3. The claimant arrived in the UK on 25 December 1999 and was given leave
      to enter as a visitor for a period of six  months.  In  1999  Jamaican
      citizens did not require entry clearance to  visit  this  country.  At
      that date the claimant was 11 years old. The following year his mother
      made an application on his behalf for a grant of indefinite  leave  to
      him to remain as her dependant. The application was refused in January
      2003 and the appeal was dismissed on 25  March  2005.  The  claimant's
      appeal rights became exhausted on 15 April 2005. The claimant's father
      was deported to Jamaica in May 2001 following involvement in what  the
      Secretary  of  State  said  were  criminal  affairs   including   drug
      importation.


   4. On 28 April 2008 the claimant was served with a  notice  advising  him
      that he was an overstayer. However, was granted temporary admission on
      1 May 2008.


   5. On 21 October 2010 at Wood Green  Crown  Court  the  claimant  pleaded
      guilty to an offence of wounding with intent. He was sentenced  to  30
      months imprisonment and there was no appeal against  sentence.  Notice
      of his liability to automatic deportation was served  on  23  December
      2010 and he responded on 11 January 2011. The claimant claimed  asylum
      on 19 September 2012. The application for  asylum  was  refused  on  2
      April 2013 at the same time as the deportation order was made.


   6. The claimant appealed and the panel heard  his  appeal  on  23  August
      2013. Both parties were represented,  the  claimant  by  Mr  Ren�  who
      appears before me. The panel heard evidence from the claimant and four
      other witnesses. The panel concluded that to remove the claimant  from
      the UK would  infringe  his  Article  8  human  rights.  It  would  be
      disproportionate to require him to move to and live  in  Jamaica.  The
      appeal was allowed.


   7. The Secretary of State applied for  permission  to  appeal  which  was
      granted  by  a  judge  in  the  First-Tier  Tribunal.  The  claimant's
      representatives have submitted a Rule 24 response.


   8. Having checked the documents with Mr Ren� I understand that I have all
      the documents which were before the panel.


   9. At an early stage in Mr Deller's submissions it became  apparent  that
      he was seeking to put forward matters which were arguably  not  within
      the grounds of appeal. He made an application to amend  the  Secretary
      of State's grounds so that the first ground should include; "The First-
      Tier Tribunal has failed to perform a  proper  balancing  exercise  in
      that its determination is bereft of reference to any question  of  the
      weight to be afforded to the public interest. No regard is had, within
      or outside the  context  of  the  post  9  July  2012  Rules,  to  the
      seriousness  of  the  offence,  the  public  interest  in   expressing
      revulsion that such crime or the interest of deterrence of others". Mr
      Ren� did not object to the amended grounds and said that he was  in  a
      position to deal  with  them  without  adjournment.  I  permitted  the
      grounds to be amended.


  10. Mr Deller submitted that the panel had failed to apply the  Article  8
      provisions of the Immigration Rules. There was no suggestion that  the
      claimant met the requirements of these Rules. The panel concluded that
      the claimant had no family life in this country,  only  private  life.
      The main thrust of his submissions was  that  whilst  considering  the
      factors in favour of the claimant at great length the panel failed  to
      take into account any element of the public interest  in  deportation.
      The factors in favour of the claimant had been  over  emphasised.  The
      public interest elements were material and essential matters.  Without
      them there was no proper balance. The panel failed to demonstrate that
      it had any regard to the public interest and  did  not  even  consider
      whether the claimant had committed a serious offence.


  11. It was also submitted that the statement in the  last  four  lines  of
      paragraph 53 was partially but significantly incorrect. It was correct
      to say that paragraph 398 applied but not that paragraphs 399 and 399A
      did not. The panel set out the correct position in paragraphs 9 and 10
      but did not follow this and  instead  applied  an  incorrect  line  of
      reasoning in paragraph 53.  The  panel  lost  sight  of  what  it  was
      required to do. I was asked to find that the panel erred in law and to
      set aside and remake the decision.


  12. Mr Ren� relied on the claimant's Rule 24 reply. He submitted that  the
      panel had  carried  out  a  proper  balancing  exercise.  He  drew  my
      attention to the reference to the public interest and public  interest
      elements in paragraphs 52, 55 and 57. In paragraph 56 they  said  that
      all the factors before them had been considered on a cumulative basis.
      In response to my question, Mr Ren�  said  that  the  public  interest
      elements were dealt with in paragraphs 49 to 61 of the refusal letter.
      The panel summarised the relevant aspects of  the  refusal  letter  in
      paragraphs 9 to 11.


  13. Mr Ren� accepted that the claimant came within  paragraph  398(b)  but
      could not bring him within paragraphs 399 or 399A. He claimed and  the
      panel concluded that there were exceptional  circumstances  such  that
      the public interest in deportation was  outweighed  by  other  factors
      under paragraph 398(c). The panel had only taken  delay  into  account
      from 2010 and the issue of the  letter  indicating  the  claimant  was
      liable to be deported. The Secretary of State delayed from then  until
      April 2013 when the deportation order was issued.


  14. Mr Ren� argued that the second ground of appeal was  no  more  than  a
      disagreement with the findings properly  reached  by  the  panel.  The
      current jurisprudence was contained in MF  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 (08 October  2013).
      I was asked to find that there was no error of law and to  uphold  the
      decision. I asked Mr Ren� what course he submitted should be  followed
      if I found that there were errors of law and set aside  the  decision.
      He accepted that I would not need to hear any further evidence. He had
      made all the submissions he would wish to make in connection  with  my
      remaking the decision. I reserved my determination.


  15. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and I see no good
      reason to do so.


  16.  The panel set out its reasoning in  paragraphs  50  to  61.  All  the
      factors which assist the claimant are set  out.  I  need  to  consider
      whether the factors which go to the  public  interest  in  deportation
      have been equally or at least sufficiently considered.


  17. The principle that the  private  and/or  family  life  rights  of  the
      claimant need to outweigh the public interest in seeing  him  deported
      is referred to in paragraph 52. In paragraph 55 the  panel  said;  "we
      have  paid  careful  and  particular  account  to  the  terms  of  the
      respondent's deportation decision letter which set out the reasons why
      the  respondent  considered  that  it  was  appropriate  to   make   a
      deportation order." The relevant part of the decision letter refers to
      the legitimate aims of preventing disorder and crime  and  maintaining
      an effective immigration control, the public good and public  interest
      which would be served by the removal of the claimant, the  nature  and
      seriousness of the offence which the Secretary of  State  regarded  as
      serious and compelled her to give significant weight to  the  question
      of protecting society against crime.


  18.  In paragraph 57 the panel said; "the decision  and  the  consequences
      must be  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  and  lawful  aim  of  the
      respondent in  discharging  her  duty  with  respect  to  ensuring  an
      appropriate system of immigration control.  Accordingly  the  ultimate
      test is whether, on the facts, the same is proportionate  in  all  the
      circumstances. Of course we take into account issues involving  public
      interest and the economic interests of society."


  19. It would have been better if the  panel  had  spelt  out  the  factors
      relevant to the public interest in terms and not by  reference  but  I
      find that in a clear and detailed  determination  the  panel  did  pay
      sufficient regard to the factors going to  the  public  interest.  The
      panel considered and did more than  pay  lip  service  to  the  public
      interest factors which the Secretary of State had set out.


  20. The panel referred to MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria  [2012]  UKUT
      393 (IAC) (31 October  2012)  and  followed  a  two-stage  process  in
      considering Article 8 under the Immigration Rules and  the  Strasbourg
      jurisprudence. Since the hearing before the panel. The Court of Appeal
      have now heard the appeal in MF (Nigeria) and concluded  that  a  two-
      stage process is not required, although a one  stage  or  a  two-stage
      process are not likely to lead to different conclusions. MF  (Nigeria)
      in the Court of Appeal has since been revisited by the Upper  Tribunal
      in Kabia (MF: para 298 - "exceptional circumstances") 2013 UKUT  00569
      (IAC). This was not before me  or  addressed  at  the  hearing  but  I
      consider that it makes no material change to the guidance contained in
      MF (Nigeria) in the Court of Appeal.


  21. I find that the panel did have proper regard to the Immigration  Rules
      in making the Article 8 assessment. This is apparent from paragraph 53
      of the determination  and  the  reference  to  paragraph  397  of  the
      Immigration Rules in paragraph 61 which contains the same  exceptional
      circumstances test as paragraph 398(c).


  22. I find that the panel did not err in its consideration of  the  effect
      of delay by the Secretary of State and  that  the  criticisms  of  the
      panel's reasoning in the second ground of  appeal  are  no  more  than
      disagreements with findings properly made. They do  not  identify  any
      error of law.


  23. In paragraphs 43 to 45 of MF (Nigeria) the Court of Appeal said;

        "43. The word "exceptional" is often used to denote a departure from
        a general rule. The general rule in the present context is that,  in
        the case of a foreign prisoner to whom paras 399  and  399A  do  not
        apply; very compelling reasons will  be  required  to  outweigh  the
        public interest in deportation. These  compelling  reasons  are  the
        "exceptional circumstances".
        44. We would, therefore, hold that the new rules are a complete code
        and that the exceptional  circumstances  to  be  considered  in  the
        balancing exercise involve the application of a proportionality test
        as  required  by  the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence.   We   accordingly
        respectfully do not agree with the UT that the decision-maker is not
        "mandated or directed" to take all the relevant article  8  criteria
        into account (para 38).
        45. Even if we were wrong about that, it would be necessary to apply
        a proportionality test outside the new rules as was done by the  UT.
        Either way, the result should be the same. In  these  circumstances,
        it is a sterile question whether this is required by the  new  rules
        or it is a requirement of the general law. What matters is  that  it
        is required to be carried out if paras 399 or 399A do not apply."


  24. In paragraph 61, albeit as an alternative conclusion, the panel  found
      that the claimant's circumstances were exceptional and outweighed  the
      public interest in deportation. Taken  in  context  I  find  that  the
      exceptionality  test  which  the  panel  applied  was  not  materially
      different to the test of very compelling reasons which  the  Court  of
      Appeal  equated  to  exceptional  circumstances.  The  conclusion  was
      generous but one open to the panel on the all  the  evidence.  I  find
      that the panel did not err in law and I uphold the determination.
