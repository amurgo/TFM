               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                            MR RONALD Baldacchino
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)



                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. L Tarlow, Senior Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    None


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The Secretary of State appeals against a  decision  of  Judge  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal Cohen who in a  determination  promulgated  on  28
      July 2015 allowed the appeal  of  Mr  Ronald  Baldacchino,  a  Maltese
      national, against a decision of the Secretary  of  State  made  on  28
      October 2014 to make a deportation order  against  him  under  Section
      5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.


   2. Although the Secretary of State is the appellant before me I will  for
      ease of reference refer to her  as  the  respondent  as  she  was  the
      respondent in the First-tier.  I therefore refer to Mr Baldacchino  as
      the appellant as he was the appellant in the First-tier.

   3.  The appellant claims to have arrived in Britain in 2005  and  applied
      to the Home Office for a residence permit as an  EEA  national  on  22
      November that year. He was granted a residence  permit  with  validity
      for five years in February 2006.

   4.   In  May  2014  he  was  convicted  at  Snaresbrook  Crown  Court  of
      threatening a person with an offensive weapon in a  public  place  and
      sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment and ordered to pay  a  victim
      surcharge of ï¿½100.  He  did  not  appeal  against  his  conviction  or
      sentence.  On 20  May  2014  he  was  notified  of  his  liability  to
      deportation on the grounds of public  policy  or  public  security  in
      accordance  with  Regulation  19(3)(b)  of   the   Immigration   (EEA)
      Regulations 2006.  He made representations thereafter  as  to  why  he
      should not be deported.  Regulation 19(3) relates to a decision of the
      Secretary of State when it has been decided that the  removal  an  EEA
      national is justified on grounds of public policy, public security  or
      public health in accordance with Regulation 21.  Regulation  21  deals
      with the removal of EEA nationals who have committed crimes.  It makes
      a distinction between those who have permanent residence because  they
      have lived here  exercising Treaty  rights for 5 years, those who have
       permanent residence and have  lived here of 10 years  and  those  who
      have leave to remain for a limited period.

   5.   The judge found that the appellant had exercised not  Treaty  rights
      here for 10 years and that therefore was not entitled the higher level
      of protection.  What he stated was that "the appellant is  in  respect
      of regulation 21(5) of the  regulations".   I  consider  that  he  was
      focusing on the terms of Regulation 21  (5)  (c)  which  states   that
      revocation is justified  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
      security or public health and thereafter that can lead to the  removal
      of the EEA national.

   6.  The judge had before him a probation officer's report dated 10  April
      2015.  In it the probation officer states:


         "Upon his release Mr Baldacchino had  initially  been  assessed  as
         posing a high risk of harm to the public, an assessment  which  was
         purely based on the severity of the  offence.  However  due  to  Mr
         Baldacchino's willingness to accept and reflect  on  his  behaviour
         alongside the evidence of him being dedicated to living a  positive
         life Mr Baldacchino is currently assessed as posing a  medium  risk
         of harm to the general public.  This assessment  is  based  on  the
         fact the index offence is serious  in  nature.   However  there  is
         little evidence to suggest that Mr Baldacchino  may  be  minded  to
         react in this way again in the future.  I have considered  reducing
         this risk to low should Mr Baldacchino continue to demonstrate  the
         same attitude, acceptance  and  self-awareness  and  responsibility
         over a significant period."


7.   However, the judge in his determination did  not  quote  directly  from
    the report. Rather he lifted the part of the report which was  set  out
    in the skeleton argument before him and concluded  that  the  probation
    officer had indicated that the appellant posed no present risk and that
    "following  the  passage  of   additional   time   of   the   appellant
    demonstrating the same attitude, acceptance and self-awareness that  he
    had demonstrated to date would consider reducing this risk to low".  He
    goes on to say:

         "Based upon the appellant's significant period of time spent in the
         UK  one  offence  caused   during   unjustifiable   but   emotional
         circumstances the appellant's low sentence compared to the possible
         maximum  the  positive  comments  made  by  his  probation  officer
         indicating that the appellant potentially will be low at  posing  a
         low risk of harm to the public in the future and  no  reference  of
         continuing harm to the victim who has disappeared off the scene and
         having been dismissed by his previous employer who is  the  current
         employer of the sponsor I find that the appellant simply  does  not
         pose the relatively high risk that is  of  representing  a  genuine
         present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society I do not find that  the  appellant
         poses a significant risk of re-offending or that his deportation is
         justified and serious grounds of public policy."


 8.   The Secretary of State argued in the grounds of appeal that there was
    no basis on which the judge could have reached the conclusion that  the
    appellant had a permanent right of residence.  When granting permission
    Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds did not accept that assertion  and  referred
    to the fact that in the letter of refusal the respondent  had  accepted
    that the appellant  had  permanent  residence.  That  ground  has  been
    renewed before me by Mr Tarlow  but  for  the  same  reasons  as  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Reeds I consider that that ground has no merit. What  is
    relevant, is, of course, that the appellant does not have  the  highest
    level of protection as he has not exercised Treaty rights here  for  10
    years.


 9.   Be that as it may, however, the grounds of appeal  also  argued  that
    the judge was not entitled to reach the conclusion  that  the  personal
    conduct of the appellant did not  represent  as  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society: that is the test set out in Regulation 21(5)(c).


 10.  I can only conclude that that is correct. I consider that the judge's
    conclusions did not properly take into account the  clear  findings  in
    the probation officer's report which state in terms that the  appellant
    had been assessed as posing a high risk of harm to the public and  that
    that had been based obviously quite properly on  the  severity  of  the
    offence.  In any event he was currently assessed  as  posing  a  medium
    risk  of  harm  to  the  general  public:   that   simply   cannot   be
    characterised as not being a sufficiently serious threat affecting  one
    of the fundamental interests of society.  I  therefore  set  aside  the
    decision of the Immigration Judge.


 11. There has been no appearance by the appellant before me today  or  any
    appearance on his behalf.  I note that the appeal had  previously  been
    adjourned because it was said that  he  had  returned  to  Malta.   The
    appellant's solicitors have  written  in  to  say  that  they  have  no
    instructions.  It was for that reason that I considered it  appropriate
    to proceed to hear the issue of  the  error  of  law  in  this  appeal.
    Having made a decision on error of law  I  see  no  reason,  given  the
    evidence that the appellant is not here and is living in Malta and that
    indeed that in any event should he attempt to re-enter the  country  he
    could  be  refused  entry  on  public  interest  grounds  that  it   is
    appropriate that I should determine the appeal before me substantively.


 12. In doing that I take into account the terms of the probation officer's
    report dated 10 April 2015 and the fact that  the  appellant  had  been
    assessed as posing a high risk of harm to the public  -  an  assessment
    which had been based on the severity of the offence  -  and  that  that
    risk had only been lowered to a medium risk of harm. I also  take  into
    account the remarks of the sentencing Judge who referred to the  number
    of aggravating circumstances in this case which include the  fact  that
    the appellant had brought a machete to the scene of the crime and  that
    he had chased the victim down the road - the Judge pointed out  it  was
    fortunate that he had not made contact  with  the  victim.   Given  the
    seriousness and nature of the offence I consider that  serious  grounds
    of public policy and public security arise under  Regulation  21(3).  I
    have taken into account the   issue  of  the  appellant's  private  and
    family life here but the reality is that there is nothing  to  indicate
    to me that he has done anything other than  break these  ties  -  while
    his partner has children  here , he is not the father.


 13. In all, consider that the decision of the Secretary of State  to  make
    the deportation order was a decision which was fully open to her on the
    evidence before her.  I therefore in re-making this  decision  I  allow
    the appeal of the respondent and dismiss the appellant's appeal against
    the decision to make a deportation order.


 Decision
     The decision of the Judge in the First-tier is set aside.
        The  appeal  of  the  appellant  against  the  decision  to  make  a
   deportation order is dismissed.

Signed                                  Date 19 May 2016
