Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr N Kannangara (counsel) instructed by Malik Law
Chambers
For the Respondent: Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of the Appellants. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2. This is a resumed hearing in an appeal  by  the  Appellants  against  the
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Hussain  promulgated  on  7  December
2016,  which  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal.  The  First-tier  Judge's
decision was set aside by a decision of the Upper Tribunal dated  16  August
2017

Background


3. The first appellant was born on 8 March 1983. The  second  appellant  was
born on 4 August 1983. Both appellants are  Nigerian  nationals.  The  first
appellant entered the UK on 22 April 2005  as  a  student.  He  was  granted
variations of leave to remain which expired on 18 December 2011. The  second
appellant arrived in the UK on 12 August 2007 as a dependent  of  the  first
appellant. The appellants have two children. Their first child was  born  on
[ ] 2008. Their second child was born on [ ] 2010.

4. The appellants applied for variation of  leave  to  remain  before  their
existing leave expired on 18 December 2011. Parties  agree  that  the  first
appellant meets  the  notional  10-year  long  residence  rule  because  the
appellants  have  enjoyed  section  3C  leave  since  the  application   was
submitted in December  2011.  The  respondent  argues  that  the  appellants
cannot meet the requirements of paragraph 276B(iv) of the immigration  rules
because the first appellant cannot comply with the life in the UK test.

5. The appellants argued that the respondent has  refused  to  return  their
passports so that neither of them can sit the life  in  the  UK  test;  they
argue that the fact that the appellants have proved more than 10 years  long
residence is a  material  consideration  relevant  to  the  article  8  ECHR
grounds of appeal.

6. In a decision promulgated on 16 August 2017 Upper Tribunal Judge Coker
set the First-tier Tribunal's decision aside, and continued the case to
this resumed hearing.

The hearing

7. Mr Kannangara, counsel for  the  appellants,  asked  me  to  adjourn  the
hearing. He told me that both appellants have now sat and  passed  the  life
in the UK test, but neither appellant has  been  able  to  sit  the  English
language test required by paragraph 276B(iv)  of  the  rules  because  their
passports have not been released by the Secretary of State. He asked  me  to
adjourn the case and  ordain  the  respondent  to  release  the  appellant's
passports so that they can take the English language test.

8. Ms Isherwood, for the respondent opposed the application to adjourn.  She
told me that the  Secretary  of  State  will  not  release  the  appellant's
passports. She argued that the first appellant is in breach of  his  section
3C leave because he is now working full-time. She told me that she has  only
received a copy of the Upper Tribunal's decision dated 16 August  2017  this
morning, and  that  directions  had  not  been  complied  with  because  the
respondent was unaware of the directions.

9. I refused the application to adjourn this case. This case relates  to  an
application which was originally made in  December  2011,  and  already  has
significant procedural history. The application to adjourn comes  too  late.
It was made this morning, for the first time, no notice of  the  application
was given to the respondent.  Clear  directions  were  given  in  the  Upper
Tribunal decision dated 16 August 2017  which  both  parties  have  ignored.
This resumed hearing was transferred  by  interlocutor  dated  13  September
2017 because of concerns about the passage of time. There is no good  reason
to delay the determination of this appeal any further. I am  satisfied  that
I can justly determine  this  appeal  and  that  parties'  agents  have  had
adequate time to prepare for today's hearing.

10. (a) Mr Kannagara moved the appeal. He relied on the directions  made  by
the Upper Tribunal on 16 August 2017 and told me that he would lead  no  new
oral evidence. He told me that at [5] of the Upper Tribunal decision  (dated
16 August 2017) it is recorded that permission has already been  granted  to
amend the grounds of appeal to rely on both paragraphs 276B and 276  ADE  of
the immigration rules. He reminded me that at [6] of  the  Upper  Tribunal's
decision of 16 August  2017  the  respondent's  concession  that  the  first
appellant met the notional 10-year lawful residents is recorded.

(b) Mr Kannagara reiterated that the Senior Home Office  Presenting  Officer
clearly says that the appellants' passports will not be  released.  He  told
me that the respondents intransigence is the only thing  that  prevents  the
appellants from meeting all of the requirements of  paragraph  276B  of  the
rules. He told me that because it  has  already  been  accepted  before  the
Upper Tribunal  that  the  first  appellant  has  accrued  10  years  lawful
residence, and because the second appellant has now accrued 10 years  lawful
residence, the appeals should  be  allowed  under  paragraph  276A1  of  the
rules, which would grant both appellants an extension of stay so that  their
passports can be released, and they  can  submit  a  fresh  application  for
indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 276B of the immigration rules

11. For the respondent, Ms Isherwood told me that  the  first  appellant  is
working full-time, and so breaches the terms of 3C leave because  the  grant
of leave to remain that he had at the  date  of  application  was  leave  to
remain as a student. She told me that there is inadequate evidence  to  show
that the appellants meet the  requirements  of  paragraph  276B(ii)  of  the
immigration rules, so  that  the  appeals  cannot  succeed  under  paragraph
276A1. She told me  that  the  appellants  will  not  meet  the  maintenance
requirements of the immigration  rules,  and  that  the  evidence  that  the
appellants rely on indicates that the appellant still have ties to  Nigeria;
in particular, the first appellant's parents live in Nigeria.  Ms  Isherwood
urged me to dismiss the appeals.

My Findings of fact

12. (a) The first appellant entered the UK on 22 April 2005  as  a  student.
He was granted variations of leave to remain expiring on 18  December  2011.
The second appellant arrived in the UK on 12 August 2007 as a  dependent  of
the first appellant. The appellants have two  children.  Their  first  child
was born on [ ] 2008. Their second child was born on [ ] 2010.

(b) On 15 December 2011 the  appellants  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
remain in the UK. The respondent refused that  application  on  14  November
2012. The appellants appealed the decision of  14  November  2012,  and  the
respondent withdrew her decision.  The  respondent  made  a  fresh  decision
refusing the applications on 18 June  2013.  The  appellants  appealed  that
decision. Their appeal was successful to the extent that their  applications
were remitted to the respondent to issue a fresh  decision.  The  respondent
issued fresh decisions on 31 March 2015. It is  those  decisions  which  are
the subject of this appeal.

(c) The appellants have enjoyed s.3C  leave  since  18  December  2011.  The
first appellant has now accrued 12� years lawful residence in the  UK.   The
second appellant has now accrued 10 years and two  months  lawful  residence
in the UK.

(d) The appellants' children both attend primary school. They were  born  in
the UK and have not lived anywhere other than the UK.  They  are  happy  and
well settled at school, where they  are  making  good  progress.  They  each
enjoy a circle of friends. Neither child has ever visited Nigeria. They  are
both qualifying children in terms of s.117B of the Nationality,  Immigration
and Asylum Act 2002.

(e) The appellants  are  both  in  employment.  The  first  appellant  earns
�10,000  per  annum.  The  second  appellant  works  part  time  and   earns
approximately �800 per month.

(f) On 20 July 2017 the first appellant sat  and  passed  the  knowledge  of
life in the UK test. On 13 October 2017 the second appellant sat and  passed
the knowledge of life in the UK test.

Analysis

13. Paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules says

   276B. The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite leave  to
   remain on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom are that:
        (i) (a) he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in
        the United Kingdom.
        (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons why
        it would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave to
        remain on the ground of long residence, taking into account his:
              (a) age; and
              (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and
              (c) personal history, including character, conduct,
              associations and employment record; and
              (d) domestic circumstances; and
              (e) compassionate circumstances; and
              (f) any representations received on the person's behalf; and
        (iii) the applicant does not fall for refusal under the general
        grounds for refusal.
        (iv) the applicant has demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the
        English language and sufficient knowledge about life in the United
        Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.
        (v) the applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration
        laws, except that, where paragraph 39E of these Rules applies, any
        current period of overstaying will be disregarded. Any previous
        period of overstaying between periods of leave will also be
        disregarded where -
              (a) the previous application was made before 24 November 2016
              and within 28 days of the expiry of leave; or
              (b) the further application was made on or after 24 November
              2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied.

14. Paragraph 276A1 of the Immigration Rules says

      276A1.The requirement to be met by a person seeking  an  extension  of
      stay on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom is that the
      applicant meets each of the requirements in paragraph 276B(i)-(ii) and
      (v).

15. When the application which gives  rise  to  this  appeal  was  submitted
neither appellant had been in the UK for 10 years. By the time  this  appeal
called before the Upper Tribunal on 24 July 2017,  the  respondent  accepted
that the first appellant met the notional 10 year lawful  residence.  It  is
clear from [6] of the decision of the Upper Tribunal dated  16  August  2017
that the respondent's focus (in July  2017)  was  on  276B(iv)  because  the
first appellant had not passed the life in the UK  test.  By  the  time  the
Upper Tribunal's decision of 16 August  2017  was  promulgated,  the  second
appellant had been in the UK for 10 years.  By  the  time  this  case  calls
before me both appellants have sat and passed the knowledge of life  in  the
UK test, but neither of the appellants has sat and passed  English  language
test.

16. Because of the passage of time,  the  grounds  of  appeal  were  amended
before the First-tier Tribunal, so that arguments could be  presented  under
paragraph 276B and 276 ADE of the immigration rules.  When  the  application
to adjourn was made before me, parties agents could  not  agree  whether  or
not it was possible for the appellant's passports to be released.

17. As a matter of fact, the appellants  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of
paragraph 276B(iv) solely because they have not sat and passed  the  English
language test. They meet all of  the  remaining  requirements  of  paragraph
276B.

18. On the facts as I find them to be, both appellants have now  accrued  10
years continuous lawful residence in the UK. Although the respondent  argues
that the first appellant has breached section  3C  leave  because  he  works
full time, that is  not  an  argument  which  was  taken  before  the  Upper
Tribunal  in  July  2017,  when  the  respondent  conceded  that  the  first
appellant met the notional 10 year lawful  residence  because  he  had  been
subject to 3C leave since his application made in  December  2011.  In  July
2017 the respondent's position was solely that the first appellant  had  not
sat and passed both components of the life in the UK test.  Both  appellants
meet the requirements of paragraph 276B(i) of the rules.

19. The first appellant was born in 1983. He  has  lived  in  the  UK  since
2005. He left  Nigeria  when  it  was  22.  He  is  now  34.  He  has  spent
approximately 36% of his life in the UK. He has  spent  most  of  his  adult
life in the UK. The second appellant was born in 1983 and arrived in the  UK
in 2007. She left Nigeria when she was 24 years old  and  is  now  34  years
old. She has spent most of her adult life in the UK.

20. Both appellants have developed friendships in the  UK.  Their  home  and
their employment is in the UK. The documentary evidence indicates that  they
are both fluent in  the  English  language  and  they  have  both  past  the
knowledge of life in the UK test. There is insufficient evidence  before  me
to find that either of the appellants had  breached  immigration  laws.  The
weight of  reliable  evidence  indicates  that  neither  appellant  has  any
criminal  convictions.  The  weight  of  reliable  evidence  indicates  that
neither appellant has any pending prosecutions or outstanding  charges.  The
weight of reliable evidence indicates that both of the  appellants  children
were born in the UK, and are now in primary education in the  UK;  they  are
immersed in UK culture. Placing reliance on those factors I  find  that  the
appellants meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276B(ii)  &  (v)  of  the
immigration rules.

21. Since July 2017 it has been the respondent's  position  that  the  first
appellant meets all  of  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276B  other  than
paragraph 276B(iv). The respondent's position before the Upper  Tribunal  in
July 2017 was that the first appellant met  the  requirements  of  paragraph
276B(i)(ii) & (v). On the facts as I find them to be  both  appellants  meet
those requirements today.

22. As I find that  both  appellants  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
276B(i)(ii) & (v), by analogy I find that  they  meet  the  requirements  of
paragraph 276A1.

23. The passage of time created by the procedural history of this  case  has
changed both the nature of the application and the arguments  at  appeal.  I
find that the appellants both meet the requirements of  paragraph  276A1  of
the rules. The effect of that decision is that the appellants  are  entitled
to an extension of stay in the UK for up to two  years.  That  extension  of
stay  will  enable  both  appellants  to  attempt  both  components  of  the
knowledge of  life  in  the  UK  test  and  if  they  wanted  to  submit  an
application focusing on paragraph 276B of the immigration rules.

Article 8 ECHR

24 I am mindful of Section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration
Act 2009, and the case of ZH  (Tanzania)  v  SSHD  [2011]  UKSC 4.        I
remind myself of the cases of Azimi-Moayed and others  (decisions  affecting
children; onward appeals), [2013] UKUT 00197 and PW [2015] CSIH 36.  It has
long been established that it is in the  interests  of  children  to  remain
with their parents. I find that the appellants are entitled to an  extension
of stay on the grounds of long residence in accordance with paragraph  276A1
of the immigration rules. The appellants children should  not  be  separated
from their parents.

25. At the date of application neither of the appellants children  had  been
in the UK for seven years. Because of the procedural history  of  this  case
both of the children are now more than seven years of age. I  must  consider
section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which says

      Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

      (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
      interest.

      (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
      of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
      seek to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  are  able  to  speak
      English, because persons who can speak English-

           (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

           (b) are better able to integrate into society.

      (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
      of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
      seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
      independent, because such persons-

           (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

           (b) are better able to integrate into society.

      (4) Little weight should be given to-

           (a) a private life, or

           (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

      that is established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the
      United Kingdom unlawfully.

      (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by  a
      person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.

      (6) In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
      public interest does not require the person's removal where-

           (a)  the  person  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
           relationship with a qualifying child, and

           (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the
           United Kingdom.

26.  Both  of  the  appellants  children  are  qualifying   children.   Both
appellants have a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with  their
qualifying children. The question becomes whether or not  it  is  reasonable
to expect either of the appellants children to leave the UK.

27.  The  appellants  have  prevented  from  meeting  the  requirements   of
paragraph 276B by the respondent's intransigence. The respondent  resolutely
refuses to release the appellant's passport. I am told by  the  Senior  Home
Office Presenting Officer that their passports will  not  be  released,  but
that it might be possible to make certified  copies  available.  I  am  told
that the appellants have written  to  the  respondent  on  more  than  three
occasions asking for release of their passports so that  they  can  sit  the
English language test. I am told that the appellants  have  not  received  a
response to any of those requests.

28. The appellants' children know nothing of life  in  Nigeria.  There  were
born in the UK and have been brought up in the UK. They are well settled  in
primary school, where they are making good  progress.  The  only  life  that
they know is life in the UK.

29. In Treebhawon and others (section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 674 (IAC) it was
held that (i)  Section 117B (6) is a reflection of  the  distinction  which
Parliament has chosen to make between persons who are,  and  who  are  not,
liable to deportation. In  any  case  where  the  conditions  enshrined  in
section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  are
satisfied, the section 117B(6) public interest  prevails  over  the  public
interests identified in section 117B (1)-(3); (ii) Section 117B (4) and (5)
are not parliamentary prescriptions of the public  interest.  Rather,  they
operate as instructions to courts and tribunals  to  be  applied  in  cases
where the balancing exercise is  being  conducted  in  order  to  determine
proportionality under Article 8 ECHR, in cases where either of the  factors
which they identify arises.

30. In R(on the application MA  (Pakistan)  and  Others)  v  Upper  Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and Another [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705  it  was
held  that  when  assessing  the  best  interests  of  the  child,  it   was
inappropriate to treat the  child  as  having  a  precarious  status  merely
because that was true of the parents. The observation that  people  arriving
in the UK on a temporary basis could be expected to leave could not be  true
of a child. They were not to be blamed for the fact that their  parents  had
overstayed illegally, and the starting point was that  their  status  should
be legitimised unless there was good reason not to do so.

31. On the facts as I find them to be, if the appellants  were  given  their
passports it is more than likely that there were no difficulties in  passing
the English language test, but having done so it  is  more  likely  that  an
application under paragraph 276B will be successful. The  only  obstacle  in
their way is the  respondent's  refusal  to  release  their  passports.  The
appellants' children are immersed in UK culture. They are  now  immersed  in
the UK education system. Having made those findings, I can  only  find  that
it is not reasonable to expect the appellants' children to leave the UK.

CONCLUSION

32. On 16 August  20  217  the  Upper  Tribunal  set  the  Judge's  decision
(promulgated on 7 December 2016) aside.

33. I now substitute my own decision.

34. The appellants'  appeals  are  allowed  under  paragraph  276A1  of  the
immigration rules.

35. The appellants' appeals are allowed on article 8 ECHR grounds
