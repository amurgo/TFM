                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr G Ahmed, of Anderson Rizwan, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. First-tier Tribunal Judge R Sullivan dismissed the  appellant's  appeal
    by a decision promulgated on 18 April 2017.

 2. The judge explains at ï¿½10 - 12 that he  decided  to  proceed  with  the
    hearing on 10 April 2017  in  absence  of  the  appellant  and  of  his
    representatives, there having  been  no  message  or  communication  to
    explain their failure to attend, and no application for an  adjournment
    or for a transfer to another venue.

 3.  The  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT   say   that   the   appellant's
    representatives had sent a letter dated 28  March  2017  requesting  an
    adjournment and a change of venue, which had clearly  not  been  placed
    before the judge, and this led to the appellant not  receiving  a  fair
    hearing.

 4. The FtT refused permission, on the view that the  adjournment  had  not
    been granted, and so the appellant and his representatives should  have
    been prepared for the hearing to go ahead, and the judge  was  entitled
    to proceed as he did.

 5. On renewal, the UT granted permission,  on  the  view  that  there  had
    arguably been error or unfairness.

 6. There was a procedural mishap in that the letter of 28 March  2017  was
    not linked to the file for the attention of a judge prior to or even at
    the hearing date.

 7. Such a mishap does not  always  disclose  procedural  unfairness.   The
    request for adjournment and transfer was a reasonable one, which  might
    sensibly have been decided either way; but  the  professional  duty  of
    representatives is always  to  prepare  on  the  assumption  that  such
    applications are not granted, and that hearing dates and venues  stand,
    unless and until the court or tribunal advises otherwise.

 8. There was perhaps no fault by the appellant personally, but parties are
    generally fixed with the actions of their representatives, because  the
    machinery of justice would otherwise be unworkable.

 9. The notice of appeal to the FtT was faxed by  the  appellant's  current
    representatives to the FtT on 17 March 2017,  with  a  covering  letter
    asking for listing at Glasgow and not  at  Harmondsworth.   The  letter
    mentioned that the appellant  had  been  resident  with  his  wife  (an
    obvious likely witness) in Scotland, and that his appeal was funded  by
    the Scottish Legal  Aid  Board.   By  the  time  of  the  hearing,  the
    appellant had been released from detention and  returned  to  Scotland.
    In those circumstances, taken with the procedural mishap, Mr  Matthews,
    very fairly, conceded that this became a borderline case, in  which  it
    might properly be said that there had been procedural unfairness.

10. Accordingly, although only by a narrow margin, I find  that  procedural
    unfairness inadvertently occurred, such that the appellant should  have
    the opportunity of a further hearing.

11. The decision of the FtT is set aside.

12. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

13. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge R Sullivan.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
