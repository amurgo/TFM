Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms N Manyarara, instructed by Greenland Lawyers LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I refer to the appellant as the respondent and to the respondent as the
    appellant  (as  they  appeared  respectively  before   the   First-tier
    Tribunal).  The appellant, Oshain  Anthony  Collins,  was  born  on  25
    December 1987 and is a male citizen of Jamaica.  The appellant appealed
    to the First-tier Tribunal (Judges N Bird and Petherbridge) against the
    decision of the respondent to deport him to Jamaica dated 17 June 2014.
     The decision to report the appellant was taken subject to Section 3(5)
    of the Immigration Act  1971.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the
    appeal and the respondent now  appeals  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with
    permission.

 2. In a careful determination, the evidence of a number of  witnesses  has
    been recorded together with the relevant Sections  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, in particular paragraphs 398 and 399 and also the provisions  of
    Section 117A of the 2002 Act.  The immigration history of the appellant
    is set out in detail at [93 - 104].   At  [135  -  136],  the  Tribunal
    stated:

         "135.    We accept that the appellant has a genuine and  subsisting
             relationship with his children who are British citizens.   The
             effect of the deportation order is such that his children will
             also  become  victims.   The  respondent  has   accepted   the
             appellant has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
             with all of the affected children in this case.

         136. We accept that it would be unduly  harsh  to  expect  them  to
             relocate to Jamaica having spent all of  their  lives  in  the
             United Kingdom.   As  the  appellant's  children  are  British
             citizens  both  the  Rules  and  Community  Law   render   any
             suggestion  to  the  contrary  unlawful  as  conceded  by  the
             respondent in Sanade (British citizen -  Zambrano  -  Direche)
             [2012] UKUT 0048 (IAC).  Furthermore it would be unduly  harsh
             to expect them to remain in the  United  Kingdom  without  the
             appellant.  The appellant has parental responsibility.  It  is
             clear  that  the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting
             relationship  with  the  children  who  are  affected  by  the
             decision."

 3. The grounds of appeal challenge,  inter  alia,  the  reasoning  of  the
    Tribunal in these paragraphs.  The Secretary of State submits that  the
    Tribunal "failed to identify what sets  this  case  apart  from  normal
    consequences of separation caused by deportation."  It is asserted that
    the Tribunal failed to adequately show why the appellant's  case  falls
    within the definition of "unduly harsh".  There was no evidence  before
    the Tribunal that the children  would  be  neglected  or  suffer  harm.
    There is no reason to expect why the  mother  of  the  children  cannot
    provide adequate care for their essential needs in the United  Kingdom.



 4. The grounds contained a factual inaccuracy; it is submitted  that  "the
    evidence is that the children live with their mothers" [1a];  in  fact,
    one of the children lives with  both  the  appellant  and  his  mother.
    There are three children in all varying in age from  18  months  to  3ï¿½
    years.  The Tribunal found [124] that the appellant has a  genuine  and
    subsisting  parental  relationship  with  all  three   children.    The
    appellant does not appear to have been convicted for any offence  since
    2012.  His offending history includes convictions for drugs offences.

 5. The Tribunal made it clear at [130] that it considered Article 8 in the
    context of the Immigration Rules and also as a  freestanding  provision
    outside those Rules.  At  times,  the  reasoning  of  the  Tribunal  as
    regards Article 8 within the context of the Rules  and  outside  it  is
    difficult to follow but it is apparent that the paragraphs which I have
    set out above contain the ratio on which the appeal was allowed, namely
    the Tribunal's conclusion that it would be unduly harsh to  expect  the
    children of the appellant to relocate to Jamaica and,  crucially,  that
    it would also be unduly harsh to expect those children to remain in the
    United Kingdom without the appellant.  It is in this latter  conclusion
    that I find that the Tribunal has seriously erred in law.  I agree with
    the submissions made by Mr Walker who appeared  for  the  Secretary  of
    State and with the arguments set out in the grounds of appeal that what
    purports to be a reasoning to support the  finding  that  it  would  be
    unduly harsh to expect the children to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    without the appellant is not in fact a  reason  at  all  but  simply  a
    statement of a number of the basic facts in this case, namely that  the
    appellant has parental responsibility for the children, that he  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with those children and  that  they
    would be "affected by the decision."  No attempt has been made  by  the
    Tribunal to engage with the concept of "undue harshness" or to  examine
    in any detail what effect the removal of the appellant  would  actually
    have upon their lives and welfare.  It appears to have been enough  for
    the Tribunal to find that "the effect of the deportation  order"  (that
    is, the removal of the appellant from the United Kingdom) would  render
    the children "victims" [135]. With respect, that  is  not  enough.   It
    cannot be the case, as the Tribunal appears  to  suggest,  that  if  an
    individual subject to a deportation order has a genuine and  subsisting
    relationship with children for whom he has parental responsibility  and
    from whom he will be  separated  that  Article  8  be  infringed.   The
    Tribunal should have supported its  conclusions  with  proper  focussed
    reasoning; generalisations are insufficient.  I therefore set aside the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision and remit the matter to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the decision.   I  set  aside  the
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal although observe that many of those
    findings appear to be uncontroversial;  it  would  be  helpful  if  the
    parties could seek to agree as much of the evidence as possible with  a
    view to avoiding the need for witnesses whose evidence is not  disputed
    attending the next hearing..

Notice of Decision

 6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal, which was  promulgated  on  19
    August 2015 is set aside.  None of the findings of  fact  shall  stand.
    The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal (not Judges N Bird or
    Petherbridge) for that Tribunal to remake the decision.

 7. No anonymity direction is made.
