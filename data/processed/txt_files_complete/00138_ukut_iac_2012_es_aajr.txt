                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



Introduction

1.    This is an application for judicial review by the claimant, a  citizen
    of Afghanistan, of decisions by the defendant, the  London  Borough  of
    Hounslow, assessing his date of birth as 1 June 1993 as opposed to  his
    claim that it is 1 June 1996.  Permission was granted by the High Court
    to challenge the  defendant's  decisions  on  11  April  2011  and  the
    application has been transferred to the Upper Tribunal.   In the  light
    of the judgment of the Supreme Court in  R  (A)  v  London  Borough  of
    Croydon [2009] UKSC 8, the task  of  the  Tribunal  is  to  assess  the
    claimant's age.

The Evidence before the Tribunal

2.    We heard oral evidence from the claimant and Balbona Mejzini from  the
    Refugee Council and on behalf of  the  defendant  from  Jacinta  Kayne,
    Hannington Nuwamanya  and  Cyril  Leroy,  all  social  workers  in  its
    employment, Gwyneth Austin, a tutor at West Thames College  and  Celina
    Dennis, an education support  mentor  at  the  Institute  of  Education
    Centre (IEC) at Brentwood Football Club.

3.    We had written evidence from Elaine  Fehrman,  an  independent  social
    worker instructed on behalf  of  the  claimant.  There  was  a  witness
    statement from Lizette Villaverde on behalf of the defendant.  She  was
    unable to  attend  the  hearing  as  she  was  abroad.   The  defendant
    instructed Dr Philip Marsden to carry out a dental age assessment.  His
    report was considered by Professor Graham  Roberts  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant.  A joint report was submitted dated 4 November 2011.

4.    The documentary evidence is in the trial bundle which is divided  into
    nine sections indexed and paginated 1.1 - 9.19.  A  notice  of  hearsay
    evidence dated 18 November 2011 in respect of the evidence  of  Lizette
    Villaverde was produced by the defendant.  On the day  of  the  hearing
    the claimant sought to adduce a response  by  Professor  Roberts  to  a
    series  of  questions  submitted  by  his  solicitor,   the   defendant
    subsequently producing a response  from  Dr  Marsden  to  that  further
    evidence on 23 November 2011.  Both counsel produced full  and  helpful
    skeleton arguments and following the hearing Ms Luh produced a  further
    supplementary note on the  burden  of  proof  dated  21  December  2011
    drawing our attention to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R  (C)J
    v Cardiff CC [2011] EWCA Civ 1590, Mr Swirsky filing a response  on  13
    January 2012.  We were also provided with a bundle of authorities.

Background

5.    The claimant  is a citizen of Afghanistan who arrived in the UK  on  2
    September 2009 making a clandestine entry by lorry. He was arrested and
    then claimed asylum.  In his screening interview on  3  September  2009
    when asked his age, he said that he was 13 years and  6  months  (7.3).
    He explained that he  had  left  Afghanistan  two  and  a  half  months
    previously for Iran where he stayed for a week before going to  Turkey.
    He was in Istanbul for six days and then travelled to Greece  by  lorry
    and ferry where he stayed for about 45 days.  Whilst he  was  there  he
    was arrested and fingerprinted.  He then travelled to France  by  train
    where he stayed for about a month, leaving on 2 September 2009 by lorry
    for the UK.

6.    He submitted a Statement of Evidence Form dated 12 October 2009  again
    claiming to be 13 years 6 months old.  In answer to the question  (A21)
    on which date he left his home country, he  replied  that  he  was  not
    sure, may be it was about three and a half months  ago.   He  supported
    his claim by a written statement also dated 12 October  2009  repeating
    his claim that he was 13 years 6 months old and saying that when he had
    left Afghanistan, his mother had told him that this was his age but  he
    did not know his calendar date of birth (7-44A).

7.    The claimant's application for  asylum  was  refused.   He  based  his
    claim on a fear of the Taliban.  He  said  that  his  father  had  been
    working for the Taliban but had disappeared about four years before  he
    left Afghanistan.  He and his family moved in to live with his maternal
    uncle and about four years later, his uncle went missing.   He  claimed
    that about three months after his  uncle's  disappearance  the  Taliban
    came to his uncle's house and bombed the yard.  An aunt and cousin were
    killed.  Later they returned asking him  to  become  a  suicide  bomber
    saying they would come back the following week to take both him and his
    brother.

8.    Arrangements were made through  the  village  leader  "the  Malik"  to
    arrange the sale of their house and for him to leave Afghanistan.   The
    Secretary of State did not  accept  that  the  claimant  had  given  an
    accurate account of his reasons for leaving Afghanistan or of his fears
    on return and his application was refused.  His age was also  disputed.
    The defendant carried out an age assessment in September 2009.  It  was
    accepted that the claimant was under 18 but his age was assessed as  16
    and a few months, his date of birth being treated as 1 June 1993.  That
    finding was disputed and the claimant's then representatives instructed
    Elaine Fehrman, an independent social worker, to  undertake  a  further
    assessment and in her report of 26 March 2010 she set out her view that
    the defendant's social workers had not given adequate reasons for their
    decision and concluded that the claimant's age was as he claimed.

9.    The claimant appealed against the decision to refuse his asylum  claim
    and his appeal was heard by IJ Williams  on  29  March  2010.   In  his
    determination issued on 7 April 2010 the judge said that  he  preferred
    the evidence of Ms Fehrman to the evidence of the local authority.   He
    commented that, although it would be impossible to come to any definite
    conclusion that the claimant at the date of hearing was only 13, he was
    satisfied, at least on the lower standard of proof, that he  was  under
    the age of 16 and accepted for the purposes of his  determination  that
    the claimant was the age which he had always asserted consistently  and
    vehemently.  He concluded that he had  been  told  the  truth   by  the
    claimant and that he would be at risk in his  home area.   As  internal
    relocation was not an option, the appeal was allowed on asylum grounds.




10.   The claimant was duly granted refugee status,  and  the  Secretary  of
    State issued a status document giving a date of birth of 1  June  1996.
    However, the defendant carried out a further age assessment in November
    2010 and maintained its view that he was in fact three years older than
    he claimed and was born in June 1993 not 1996.

The Evidence of the Claimant

11.   The claimant gave his  evidence  through  a  Pashtu  interpreter.   He
    adopted his witness statement at 2.1-20 dated 16 August 2011.  He  said
    that he was 13 years and 3 months old when he left Afghanistan in 2009.
     The journey took about 2� or 3 months and he  arrived  in  the  UK  in
    early September 2009.  The birth date of 1 June was given to him by the
    Home Office after his first interview.  He had told them that he was 13
    years and 6 months in September 2009.  He believed that it was possible
    that he might actually have been born in  March.   Calendars  were  not
    used in Afghanistan in the way they were in the UK but  in  Afghanistan
    the New Year, "Nawroz", usually fell in March.  It was a big event  and
    in his village and home he had the nickname of Nawroz.   He  had  never
    asked his mother about this but he thought it might be because  he  was
    born on or around New Year's Day.

12.   He then gave details about his family.  He has one older  brother  who
    is severely disabled and after him he is the oldest in the family.   He
    has two younger brothers and sisters.  His father disappeared  when  he
    was about 8� or 9 years old and he then stopped attending  school.   He
    had started attending when he was a little older  than  5  but  younger
    than 6.  He had been very eager to start school early.  When  he  first
    went he was not accepted because he was told  that  he  was  too  young
    although other boys in the village were accepted.  This was how he knew
    they were a little older than him.  The head teacher had spoken to  his
    mother about attending school and he remembered her  being  asked   how
    old he was but he did not know what she had  said  in  reply.   It  was
    suggested that he should wait a year to start but he was keen to attend
    school, often turning up with the other boys and  eventually  the  head
    teacher accepted and registered him in the school. He  went  to  school
    for three full years and  was  in  his  fourth  year  when  he  stopped
    attending.

13.   He confirmed  that  he  was  now  living  with  his  foster  carer  in
    Brentford and he got on well with her.   He  attended  the  IEC  Centre
    three days a week, describing it as a mixed school for children who had
    been kicked out of  normal  schools.  He  attended  maths  and  English
    lessons.  He was not happy there as he wanted to attend a normal school
    like other children of his age.  He also attended a place  in  Hounslow
    called "The Spot" for two hours each day where he was  taught  English,
    IT and maths.  He remembered seeing one of the teachers although he did
    not know that her name was Ms Dennis.  There was an occasion when a boy
    asked him his age and he said that it was no concern of his.   Normally
    he would not indicate his age but he said it was 15 when the other  boy
    mentioned 17.  He did not know whether he was talking about him or  not
    but he had not said that he was 17.  He repeated it  was  not  possible
    that he would have said that he was 17.

14.   He was asked about the age assessment carried out   by  the  defendant
    in 2009.  He said he was not asked if he wanted to have an  adult  with
    him. His social worker, Hannington was there  as  was  another  person,
    Lizette.  There was another person whose age was also  being  assessed,
    Kushal, whom he had met  in  France.   The  claimant  was  asked  about
    whether he had said that he had met him in Greece.  He  explained  that
    Kushal had been  put under pressure and was confused.   He  later  told
    the claimant that he had said that they had met in  Greece.   For  this
    reason the claimant confirmed that was the case but he later  told  the
    social worker that this was a mistake.  He was trying to cover  up  for
    Kushal.  He had  not said they had met in England but  in  France.   So
    far as his second age assessment was concerned, he said that he had not
    been  asked whether he wanted an adult to be present.

15.   In cross-examination the claimant explained that in  Afghanistan  they
    did not use a calendar but he was aware of the passing of time  because
    of events such as the New Year ceremonies.  He knew when Ramadan  would
    come because there would be an announcement in the mosque. At  the  age
    of 15 people were expected to start fasting but some children did  fast
    when they were under 15.  He said that when he left Afghanistan he  did
    not understand about months. It was only after he  arrived  in  the  UK
    that he learned what a month was.  He was asked about his evidence that
    his mother had told him how old he was just before he was due to leave.
     The elder of the village was a man called  Kazan  also  known  by  his
    title of Malik.  The Malik told his mother that he needed to  know  his
    age before embarking on such an important journey.  She  told  him  how
    old he was, 13 years 3 months.

16.   The claimant confirmed that he did not know what a month was  when  he
    was in Afghanistan but by  the  time  he  came  to  the  UK,  he  could
    calculate his age in months.  He said his  companions  told  him  about
    months saying that there were four weeks in a month, and 30 days  in  a
    month.  Before he arrived he had spent time  in  France  and  had  been
    calculating time in weeks. He had said that he was in Greece  for  four
    to five days when interviewed not 45 days.  He was asked why when first
    interviewed, he had said that he was 13 years 6 months.   He  explained
    that he had been told he was 13 years 3 months when he left Afghanistan
    and he had been travelling for about two and a half to three months and
    so he mentioned 13 years 6 months.  He accepted that when he reached 15
    he would fast during Ramadan.  He had only fasted for a few  days.   In
    his household in Afghanistan no  one  talked  about  age  although  his
    mother would have known how old he was.  The Malik  had  said  that  he
    must be told his age as he might need it on his journey and it was then
    she had said 13 years 3 months.  He had not been surprised but  he  was
    pleased to know that this was his age.

17.   He said that he had  not  known  where  he  was  going  when  he  left
    Afghanistan.  His mother had said goodbye but he  had  not  been  given
    anything to take with him: no money, no mobile phone  or  clothes.   It
    had been his mother's decision.   She  had  asked  the  Malik  to  make
    arrangements so that he could be taken away from Afghanistan.   He  had
    been  frightened of the Taliban.  His was a small village of  about  30
    households.  The question of him leaving was raised  and  then  it  had
    been about a week before he went.  After six days the Malik  said  that
    next day he was due to leave.  Land belonging to  his  uncle  had  been
    sold to pay the agent but he did not know  for  how  much  or  how  his
    family were going to live.  He  had wanted  to  leave  because  he  was
    frightened. He had not been curious about where he was going.   He  had
    no idea how long the journey would take and he was not surprised by its
    length. He had not thought at all about how he was  going  to  live  or
    find food.  The journey had taken some two and a half months.  Once  he
    was out of Afghanistan he had no  reason  to  feel  frightened  of  the
    Taliban.  He had come into the UK hidden in a box in a lorry.   He  had
    been fingerprinted when the driver called the police and later  he  had
    been handed over to social services.  No one had told him what  to  do.
    He confirmed that all the arrangements for him leaving Afghanistan  had
    been organised in a week.

18.   He explained that he had been to  school  in  Sanki  District  School.
    Initially he had been told by the teacher that he was  too  young.   He
    thought he was about 5� when he enrolled, that he had told  the  social
    workers that he was 8� when he had left and that he had been  at school
    for three years.  When he was first taken to school  he had  not  heard
    what his mother had said to the head teacher about  his  age.   He  had
    been told he could  go to school when he was  6.   The  people  he  had
    travelled with across Europe were all Afghan boys older  than  him  but
    this had not bothered him.  He had been stopped in Greece, arrested and
    fingerprinted and had spent two nights in a police station.   They  had
    only asked his name and not where he came from.  He was  also  arrested
    in France and his fingerprints were taken.  He was asked his  name  but
    not where he was from or his age.  At the age assessment he said he had
    met Kushal in Greece but later said that he had made a mistake.  He had
    travelled with him from Calais. He accepted that he had been  suspended
    from college and there had been some problems involving the police  but
    generally his studies had been going well.  He confirmed that there had
    been an incident in which the police were  involved  and  that  he  was
    being taken to court.

The Evidence of Balbona Mejzini

19.   Ms Mejzini is an advisor at the  children's  section  of  the  Refugee
    Council.  Her statement is at 2.15-20.  She confirmed that she was  the
    claimant's allocated children's panel advisor from  17  September  2009
    but first met him on 10 May 2010.  During this period she  had  had  no
    concerns that he was not  a  child  of  his  claimed  age.   Her  first
    impression, based on his appearance and  behaviour,  was  that  he  was
    clearly a child.  He was very shy and kept  smiling  a  lot.   She  had
    worked with age-disputed children  especially  from  Afghanistan.   The
    most significant indicator of immaturity  and  youth  was  his  limited
    ability to communicate.  At the end of her first meeting she felt  that
    he was an immature,  young  person  because  of  his  non-communicative
    manner, his lack of confidence and self-care skills.  She had  met  him
    and felt he had not been coping very well.  By way of example his  diet
    was very bad.  She also accompanied him to his  appointments  with  his
    legal representatives.  There  had  been  one  occasion  when  she  had
    arranged to meet him at Borough Tube Station so that they could both go
    to see his solicitor.  He was supposed to be brought by his key  worker
    but on the day he had not been available and had told the claimant  how
    to get to the station but he had not arrived.  She was in  a  panic  as
    she could not reach him by mobile.  She finally got in touch  with  him
    after 8 pm.  She described him as terrified and could hear  him  crying
    over the phone.  She calmed him down and explained how  he  could   get
    home.

20.   In cross-examination she  explained  that  the  role  of  the  Refugee
    Council was to give advice to children  on  asylum  procedures  and  to
    ensure that their welfare was met so far as accommodation, support  and
    education were concerned.  She was very experienced in dealing with age
    dispute cases.  She  had  concerns  about  the  way  local  authorities
    carried out age assessments and did not think they were carried out the
    right way: there should only be an age assessment if a claimant  really
    did not look the claimed age.  She said that she would support a client
    only if she believed them to be the age they claimed.  She had seen the
    claimant about eight to nine times.  She  had  not  obtained  a  second
    opinion: her manager had accepted her view.  She had not  thought  that
    the accommodation provided  was  the  proper  place  for  him  and  was
    confident that the claimant was the age he claimed.  She said  that  he
    had very  low  self-esteem  and  there  had  been  some  very  immature
    behaviour.  She thought that at first he had been suspicious of her and
    even when he trusted her, he still showed the same behaviour.  She  had
    been with him to solicitor's appointments  and  to  see  accommodation.
    She believed what he said about his age and accepted that she could  be
    regarded as part of his team.

Written Assessment Prepared by Elaine Fehrman

21.   Ms Fehrman has prepared two reports on behalf of  the  claimant  dated
    26 March 2010 and 6 August 2011.  Her  first  report  was  specifically
    requested to comment on the accuracy and reliability of the defendant's
    age assessment, to consider whether the instructions as  given  by  the
    claimant to his representatives were reflected during her  observations
    and enquiries, whether the age assessment paid  appropriate  regard  to
    these issues and whether  the  conclusions  reached  were  consequently
    affected or undermined by them.  Her qualifications are set out in para
    2.1.5 of her report.  She interviewed the claimant and has set out  his
    account of his background in Afghanistan and his reasons  for  leaving.
    In the interview he was consistent in his responses, confirming that he
    was 13 years old and would be 14 some time in June 2010.  He said  that
    he did not know the day, month or year of his birth but clarified  that
    he knew  his  age  because  his  mother  had  provided  him  with  this
    information prior to his departure for the UK.  He  denied  having  any
    proof in identity documentation or papers, saying that he had  none  in
    Afghanistan.  She noted that the  claimant  told  her  that  he  prayed
    regularly and did this in his room.  He did not fully  observe  Ramadan
    this past year through fasting.  She was aware from previous work  with
    Afghani young people that fasting in  Ramadan  was  generally  expected
    after the age of puberty but commented that it  could  not  clearly  be
    defined as a set age of 15  but  would  vary  between  individuals  and
    populations.




22.   She commented adversely on the lack of details in the report  prepared
    by the defendant about the interpreter and the interaction between  him
    or her and the claimant, on the fact that the report did not  elaborate
    on or consider the myriad issues about  diversity  and  discrimination,
    that the interview duration was unclear in  both  the  handwritten  and
    finalised reports and on the lack  of  clarity  of  whether  they  were
    paraphrasing what the claimant had said  or  whether  their  statements
    were sourced from third party information.  She made the point that  it
    was essential for age assessors not to rely upon  socially  constructed
    ideas of appropriate behaviour in  making  a  formulation  of  age  and
    commented on a number of errors in recording information given  by  the
    claimant.  It was her opinion that the defendant did not give  adequate
    reasons for its decision and she referred to the conflict  of  interest
    between  the  provisions  of  social  care  and  the   maintenance   of
    immigration control and to research by ILPA that social  work  managers
    placed pressure on assessing social workers to gauge children as  older
    than they are.  She concluded that there was no  credible  evidence  to
    indicate that the claimant's assertion that he was aged 13  was  untrue
    and she concluded that he would be 14 in June 2010 and  was  under  the
    age of 16 given by the defendant.

23.   In her report of 6 August 2011  she  recorded  that  she  was  further
    instructed to  give  her  opinion  as  to  the  claimant's   age.   She
    interviewed him on 6 August 2011 through an interpreter.  She  set  out
    again his background and history, his journey to the UK and his current
    situation. She  recorded  that  the  claimant  was  consistent  in  his
    responses that he was 15 and that his mother informed  him  he  was  13
    years old before his departure for the UK.  She covered again  many  of
    the issues set out in her first report and undertook a critique of  the
    further report from the defendants of November 2010.  She  referred  to
    the policy of giving the benefit of  the  doubt  in  cases  of  an  age
    dispute unless an asylum seeker's physical appearance strongly suggests
    that he is older.  It was her opinion that  the  claimant's  appearance
    did not give rise to any credible suggestion that he was older than his
    stated age and expressed the view that on the balance of  probabilities
    there  is  no  credible  evidence  to  indicate  that  the   claimant's
    assertion that he was aged 15 was untrue and she concluded that his age
    was as he claimed (16.7).

Oral Evidence called by the Defendant
Celina Dennis

 24.  Her statement is at 3.74.  She is an education support mentor at  IEC.
     She records that the claimant is a student currently attending the IEC
    for tuition.  He began attending on 4 April 2011 for three days a  week
    and has continued to date.  There  are  two  adjoining  teaching  rooms
    separated by a plaster wall with a  door.  During the lunch break on  9
    June 2011 the door between the two rooms  was open.  Some staff were in
    one room and four pupils and an attendant  were  eating  lunch  in  the
    adjoining room.  She was sitting in the room  with  the  pupils  eating
    lunch.  She, the claimant and another student were  together  around  a
    rectangular table on one side of the room. The claimant was standing by
    the nearside opposite corner of the table shuffling cards.   The  other
    student asked the claimant how old he was and he  replied  "I  am  17".
    The other student then told him that he should not bother to attend  as
    he was over the age of compulsory  education.   The  claimant  made  no
    reply but looked up to see if anyone else was listening and motioned to
    the other student he did not want to talk about it  any  further.   She
    said that during his time at the IEC students  had  periodically  asked
    the claimant about his age but he usually refused  to  answer  or  told
    them he was 15.  She did  not  indicate  that  she  had  overheard  the
    conversation but reported the matter to her manager at the end  of  the
    day.

25.   In cross-examination she confirmed that she was not a teacher but  she
    tutored groups, not taking the class  herself.   Those  attending  were
    mainly students excluded from school but the claimant did not fall into
    that category.  She knew that he was  in  foster  care  and  was  being
    looked after by the defendant.  She did not know that his  age  was  in
    dispute.  Sometimes students talked about why they  were  at  the  IEC.
    She did not know if  anyone  knew  that  the  claimant  was  being  age
    disputed.  He was not the only child there from abroad but probably the
    only unaccompanied minor.  She had never asked him about his  age;  she
    had no reason to.  The other students there often felt he looked  older
    and would say to him that he did not look as though he should be  there
    but he would say he was 15 or just not answer.  She confirmed that  she
    had heard the claimant say that he was 17 and she had told the  manager
    about this  afterwards.   It  had  been  just  a  casual  conversation.
    Matters such as this were reported as they  needed  to  know  what  was
    going on.  Anything like this that was heard was mentioned later.   She
    did not tell the claimant that she had reported the matter.   She  felt
    it was an odd thing to say  and  was  out  of  the  ordinary.   In  re-
    examination she confirmed that the other student involved was  now  16.
    He was from Somalia and she could recognise  the  difference  in  their
    voices; he was living with  his  family  and  had  been  excluded  from
    school.

Hannington Nuwamanya

26.   Mr Nuwamanya  is  a  social  worker  employed  by  the  defendant.  He
    confirmed his witness statement at 3.36-39.  He has been  the allocated
    social worker for the claimant since he came into the care of  Hounslow
    on 8 September 2009.  He had completed the initial care  assessment  on
    9/10 September 2009 based on his observations of the claimant  and  the
    assessment of  Lizette  Villaverde.   He  had  assessed  and  supported
    numerous young people from  Afghanistan  and  was  confident  that  the
    claimant was older than his stated age.  His physical features are well
    defined, his skin texture well weathered and he appeared  confident  in
    relating to adults.  He did not believe that  the  claimant's  physical
    appearance and demeanour was consistent with a 13 year old  adolescent.
    He had progressed well through the different levels of ESOL without any
    problems and did well at college just like many other 16 year  olds  he
    had looked after before. He had  provided  emotional  support  for  the
    claimant and made sure that he settled well in  his  environment  in  a
    foreign country.

27.   From his observations the claimant had not shown signs  of  struggling
    to cope with life  but he had been living just like any other  teenager
    of 16 or 17 rather than as a 13 year old.  He had had no  problem  with
    living with other young people in semi- independent accommodation  with
    16 and 17 year olds.  He had spoken to  the  claimant's   foster  carer
    with whom he had been since March 2011.  She had said that she did  not
    want to give a formal opinion on his age as she feared it  might  cause
    animosity.  She said that the claimant got on well with her 14 year old
    adopted son and her 22 year old grandson and described him as courteous
    and helpful.  Mr Nuwamanya said that he had been involved with  37  age
    assessments since January 2010.   Twenty-one  had  not  been  disputed,
    eight were disputed and eight had absconded.

28.   In cross-examination he confirmed that he had  carried  out  many  age
    assessments and was familiar with the Merton guidelines.   He  accepted
    that physical appearance on its own was not reliable: everything had to
    be considered and a claimant's life experience could have an impact  on
    the assessment.  He also accepted that behaviour  alone  would  not  be
    determinative and that no one single  factor  would  tip  the  balance.
    During the assessment on 8/9 September 2009 Ms Villaverde had not  been
    present all the time.  On 8 September he had been there by himself  but
    on 9 September she was there.  On that day he had  repeated  what  they
    had done the day before  so  that  the  claimant's  response  could  be
    assessed.  He had said that he had been  fasting because of  Ramadan on
    both days of the assessment.  He was  asked  what  age  people  started
    fasting and he replied that this was when they were 15.  He  was  asked
    why he was fasting as he was 13.   He  replied  that  he  felt  ashamed
    because everyone in the bed and  breakfast  where  he  was  living  was
    fasting but later said that it was because his mother was not there  to
    tell him to stop doing so.

29.   He accepted that the information  given  by  the  claimant  about  his
    schooling was mathematically consistent (4.10).  He had not  given  the
    name of the school.  After he was told the outcome of  the  assessment,
    both he and another young person interviewed at the same time had  said
    that they had met in Greece but the following day the claimant said  he
    wanted to change some of the information and that in fact they had  met
    in England and had not seen each other on the way at all.  Mr Nuwamanya
    was aware that  the  age  assessment  had  not  been  accepted  by  the
    immigration judge and that the defendant had decided to carry out a re-
    assessment.  He accepted that the age assessment had been discussed  at
    a meeting of the managers.  He stood by his assessment  and  never  had
    any real doubts about it.  The claimant was  a  good  learner  and  was
    quite bright.  In re-examination  he  confirmed  that  there  had  been
    criticisms that an appropriate adult had not been  provided.  He  found
    the claimant to be sociable and polite.  He was  not  someone  who  was
    monosyllabic or had difficulty in communicating but he  had  needed  to
    speak through an interpreter.  He understood that the claimant  had  at
    one point been suspended from college for fighting and was  then  taken
    to the IEC.




Gwyneth Austin

30.   Ms Austin is a student learning advisor at  West  Thames  College  and
    adopted her witness statement dated 5 July 2011 at 3.68.  She had  been
    the claimant's  tutor from September 2010  until  February  2011.   She
    said that he had not been a problem in class although  there  had  been
    incidents outside class, mostly minor but  one  serious  involving  his
    suspension from the  college  in  February  2011.   She  described  his
    attitude to work as fairly good, working well in class  but  not  doing
    very much out of class.  He was sociable  and  got  on  well  with  his
    classmates and had other friends he saw at break times and when he  was
    not in class.  She confirmed that the review at  3-65  related  to  the
    claimant unlike the tutor report at 3-66 which had been included in the
    documents in error.

31.   In cross-examination she confirmed that she was  both  a  teacher  and
    personal  tutor  and  offered  pastoral  support  to   students.    She
    remembered the claimant as a polite and friendly student.  She had  not
    been  aware that his age was in dispute when she first  met  him.   She
    remembered  a  brief  telephone  conversation  with  someone  from  the
    defendants and being told that it was about an age assessment.  She had
    spoken on the phone and felt that she had been put on the spot but said
    that the record at 3-28 accurately reflected what she  said.   She  had
    described the claimant as fitting into a class of 16 to 19 year olds as
    well as anyone else, looking the same and not standing out in  any  way
    and having no problems socialising.  In re-examination  she  said  that
    although she had felt on the spot, she would probably not say  anything
    different.  The class was for 16 to 19 year olds and  last  year  there
    had been no one under 16 in the class.  The claimant appeared to be  at
    the right level and had fitted in although they did not group  students
    by age.  The answers set out at 3-28  were   in  response  to  specific
    questions such as whether the claimant stood out in any way and whether
    he had any problems socialising.

Jacinta Kayne

32.   Her witness statement is at 3.2-7.  She is a  social  worker  employed
    by the defendant. She carried out the  second  age  assessment  on  the
    claimant on 11 and 15 November with her  colleague  Cyril  Leroy.   The
    claimant was given the opportunity of having an appropriate independent
    adult present but he declined.  She confirmed that  she  had  made  the
    note at 3.28 when speaking to the claimant's college.  She regarded him
    presenting as an image conscious young man who confidently wore  bright
    coloured clothing to both interviews.   He  presented  as  a  friendly,
    polite and confident young person. He only  became  uncomfortable  when
    inconsistencies in his account were pointed out to him and he was given
    the opportunity of explaining them.  He did not  become  aggressive  or
    challenge staff but maintained respect for them  because  he  perceived
    that they were older than him and he demonstrated  respect  for  people
    both older and in a position of authority.  She believed  that  he  was
    aged about 17 at the date of her  assessment  and  had  given  him  the
    benefit of the doubt by not assessing him as over 18.



33.   In cross-examination she said that she had done about five or six  age
    assessments and had been trained in the  Merton  guidelines.   She  was
    aware of the need to take into account ethnic issues  and  to  evaluate
    the matter holistically when assessing chronological age.  The evidence
    in the dental report was part of  the  puzzle  and  she  accepted  that
    teenagers varied in their growth and development and that if a claimant
    was from Afghanistan, he would have a different  view  of  elders  from
    someone born in this country.   He  might  also  be  expected  to  work
    earlier and this may have had a role in his physical ageing.  There had
    been enough concerns to tell the claimant that  they  did  not  believe
    that he was the age he was claiming to be.  These arose mostly  out  of
    contradictions in his statements and the information he  had  given  to
    the Secretary of State.  She did the assessment with  Cyril  Leroy.   A
    student was present but there was no independent adult.   She  accepted
    that this had not been recorded in the report and that  it  would  have
    been good practice to do so.

34.   She was asked about the inconsistencies she had set out at  4.46/7  of
    her report.  She accepted that the  Malik  and  Khazan  were  the  same
    person and that the information given about whether he  helped  out  or
    worked on the family's farm was not necessarily an  inconsistency.   So
    far as his account of the journey was concerned, the claimant had given
    very little information to the independent social worker (4.37) and she
    commented that if short and less  specific  information  was  given,  a
    person was less likely to contradict himself.  She had misgivings about
    Ms Fehrman's social report because either the claimant was  not  giving
    sufficient information or he was not being asked enough questions.  She
    thought that it was possible that he had been withholding  information.
    She explained that if she thought the matter was borderline, she  would
    give a claimant the benefit of the doubt.  She  accepted  that  on  the
    issues of whether the Malik had arranged the journey  it  was  possible
    that she had not  sought  to  clarify  this  with  the  claimant.   She
    regarded the information he gave about his school as an  under-estimate
    to support his claimed date of birth.  She accepted that he had  always
    maintained that he was 13 when he arrived. She dealt with his  physical
    appearance and so far as his demeanour was concerned, she described him
    as friendly and polite and a pleasure to  work  with.   She  could  not
    assume that he would necessarily be comfortable with  her  because  she
    was a social worker.  She had spoken to Mr  Nuwamanya  and  gained  his
    view of the claimant.  She described him as such a nice young man  that
    many professionals did not want to be  involved  in  a  decision  which
    might adversely affect him.  She believed that she had  given  him  the
    benefit of the doubt in assessing him as a late adolescent rather  than
    as an adult.

Cyril Leroy

35.   Mr Leroy is a social worker employed by the defendant.   He  confirmed
    his witness statement at 3.30-4.  He took part in the age assessment in
    November 2010.  He  was  aware  of  the  Merton  and  general  practice
    guidelines and that age assessment was a  child  centred  process.   He
    accepted that there was a  need  to  ask  questions  to  establish  the
    milestones in a child's life and that different children  would  answer
    questions differently. He was aware of the need to  take  into  account
    ethnic sensitivities and that it was  quite  common  for  someone  from
    Afghanistan to work on a farm and not to go to school.   He  was  asked
    about the impact of traumatic events on physical  appearance  and  said
    that there was no evidence to support a finding that it would  have  an
    impact on appearance.  He accepted that life experiences did need to be
    taken into account and would  impact  on  demeanour.   He  agreed  that
    people developed differently and reached  puberty  at  different  ages.
    The claimant had been asked whether he wanted an independent  adult  to
    attend.  This had not been recorded but should have been.  It  was  one
    of the main things he asked when starting an age assessment.

36.   So far  as  the  claimant's  physical  appearance  was  concerned,  in
    particular his hair, he said that teenagers liked to follow the fashion
    and the clothes he wore were also indicative of being a  teenager.   He
    would not say that any one factor was more important than another;  all
    had to be put into the balance. He accepted that Khazan and Malik  were
    one person but there was nothing in his  notes  to  show  that  he  had
    raised this discrepancy with the claimant.  It was possible that he had
    not asked because there was a need to be child sensitive and not to ask
    too many questions.  So far as the account the claimant had given about
    his journey and what was seen as a contradiction  between  the  account
    given to them and the  independent social worker, he commented that  it
    depended on whether the claimant had given them more  information.   He
    did not believe that the independent social  worker  had  asked  enough
    questions.  He also accepted that there was nothing  in  his  notes  to
    show that there had been any attempt to clarify what the  claimant  had
    been saying about when he had started school.  He accepted that it  was
    possible that he had got the age assessment wrong but  it  had  been  a
    genuine re-assessment.

Written Evidence of Lizette Villaverde
37.   The evidence of  Lizette  Villaverde  who  was  unable  to  give  oral
    evidence as she is presently abroad is set out in her statement at 3.70-
    2.  She confirmed that  she  is  a  qualified  social  worker  and  has
    conducted over 35  age  assessments.   She  was  involved  in  the  age
    assessment which took place on 8 and 10 September 2009 and says in  her
    statement that her first impressions of the claimant were suggestive of
    an individual older than 13 years, this being reinforced by his  mature
    demeanour and adolescent style of dress.  She said that he  was  unable
    to provide a consistent time frame for dates of significant events  and
    he had said that he did not use a calendar and did not know  the  dates
    of  his travel or education but was able to provide various lengths  of
    times for events such as his education, the disappearance of his father
    and his journey from Afghanistan to the UK.  She confirmed that it  was
    her joint conclusion with Mr Nuwamanya that the claimant was older than
     his claimed age and he was assessed to be about 16 years old in  2009.





Dental Assessment

38.   The evidence relating to the dental assessments  is  at  6.1-374.   Dr
    Marsden was requested  by  the  defendant  to  complete  a  dental  age
    assessment for the claimant who  gave  his  consent.   His  report  was
    completed on 1 July 2011.  He carried out a clinical dental  inspection
    on 14 June 2010 and made a chart of the teeth  present.   The  claimant
    had 28 adult teeth in the mouth; none of the  four  wisdom  teeth  were
    clinically visible.  He said that at the age stated by the claimant (14
    years 0 months at the date of the examination) only  the  third  molars
    would certainly still be developing. The wisdom  teeth  were  the  last
    teeth to develop and erupt into the mouth and he would not  expect  the
    wisdom teeth to be emerged into the mouth at this stated age.  It would
    be possible but unlikely that the second molars  would  be  at  a  late
    stage of root development.   The  assessment  of  root  development  is
    carried out by using a radiograph (x-ray) of the tooth.  The claimant's
    lower right wisdom tooth was at an angle that made an assessment of the
    roots compromised so he took a radiograph  of  the  lower  left  wisdom
    tooth. He was able to visualise the mesial root and the estimated stage
    of development in the widely used Demirjian  system  was  at  stage  F,
    representing a stage of development where the root length is  at  least
    equal to the length of the  crown  and  the  roots  have  funnel-shaped
    endings.  On both sides the second molar roots were completed.

39.   The average age for this stage of root development in Caucasoid  males
    is 16.88 years and in one paper there  is  a  note  that  the  youngest
    individual at this stage of  root  development  was  15.13  years.   Dr
    Marsden's conclusion was that on purely dental  evidence  the  claimant
    was likely to be about 17 years  of  age  or  just  under  and  it  was
    unlikely that the stated age of 14 was correct as this fell outside the
    age range for this stage of root development.  If it was accepted  that
    the day and month of birth were correct, then the most likely  year  of
    birth was 1993 giving a likely date  of  birth  as  1  June  1993.   Dr
    Marsden commented that age  assessment  at  this  stage  would  not  be
    precise and given the scarcity of age indicators there would always  be
    exceptions from the norm.

40.   Dr Marsden's report was subjected to a critique by  Professor  Roberts
    of King's College London at 6.113-132.  Following  his  report  and  in
    accordance with  the  court's  directions,  Dr  Marsden  and  Professor
    Roberts prepared a joint statement  which appears at  6.372-4.    There
    is substantial if not almost complete agreement in this  joint  report.
    It is accepted by them that dental age assessment is an accepted method
    of ageing and is considered one of the most reliable  methods  for  the
    14+ age group.  There has been a  large  amount  of  research  and  the
    results are reliable when assessed on the civil standard of the balance
    of probabilities where research consistently  gives  results  for  more
    than 50% of the  sample.   Both  agreed  that  the  radiograph  of  the
    claimant's  lower left wisdom tooth taken on 14  June  2010  could   be
    used to assess the stage of dental development of the  tooth  and  that
    the Demirjain tooth development stages were widely used in  dental  age
    assessment.  These depend upon the use of  databases  and  the  one  at
    King's College Hospital is the largest in the world.  Although there is
    no database specifically for Afghanis, its  results  are  statistically
    broadly in agreement regardless of Caucasian origin.  Using the  King's
    database the mean age of a Caucasian male at stage  F  would  be  16.57
    years. The probability that a Caucasian male at stage F would  be  less
    than 14 years and 14 days old is 1.19% whereas the probability that  he
    would be more than a 16 year old would be 69.46%.  It was  agreed  that
    the conclusion in Dr Marsden's report was valid in that, although there
    were differences in methodologies used in dental age  assessment,  they
    were on an academic level relating to  the  detail  of  the  supporting
    references only and these did not adversely affect the  age  assessment
    reached in Dr Marsden's report.

41.   On the day  of  the  hearing  the  claimant's  representatives  sought
    permission to adduce further evidence in the  form  of  a  response  by
    Professor Roberts to a series of questions submitted by the  claimant's
    solicitors.  The admission of this document was opposed by Mr  Swirsky.
    We can well understand why but we felt, in the light  of  the  need  to
    consider the welfare of a minor that this evidence should  be  admitted
    subject to Dr Marsden having a  proper  opportunity  of  providing  any
    further comments.  The questions to Professor Roberts ask  why  he  had
    carried out an age assessment referring to the King's College  database
    when he had been instructed that he was not expected to  carry  out  an
    age assessment and that he should have restricted  his  discussions  to
    the parameters of his report.  His comment on this was that it did  not
    make any sense to restrict himself to his instructions.  He  could  not
    have a joint meeting with Dr Marsden to discuss a dental age assessment
    and not put forward his own database.  He therefore felt obliged in the
    interests of providing the court with the maximum amount of information
    that would be of use to go outside the parameters of his instructions.

42.   Dr Marsden later submitted further  comments  confirming  the  opinion
    given in his report as discussed at the joint meeting.  Suffice to  say
    at this stage that the reports  and  in  particular  answers  given  by
    Professor Roberts set out in the letter of 18 November 2011 confirm  to
    us that both experts have done their best to provide the Tribunal  with
    the benefit of their obvious expertise in this area.

Submissions

43.   Mr Swirsky submitted that the burden of proof was on the  claimant  to
    show on a balance of probabilities that his age was as claimed but made
    the point that to resort to the  burden  of  proof  should  be  a  last
    resort.  The  benefit  of  the  doubt  meant  that  when  dealing  with
    children, due allowance should be made for the fact that a child  might
    have a different way of recounting narratives and  that  proper  regard
    should be paid to the fact that it was a child who was the  subject  of
    the age assessment process.  The issue for the Tribunal was not whether
    the defendant's age assessment should be quashed as  not  being  Merton
    compliant but to determine age as a factual dispute taking due  account
    of all the evidence. He argued that no reliance could be placed on  the
    claimant's own evidence as his sole point of reference for his age  was
    the fact that he had  been  told  a  matter  of  days  before  he  left
    Afghanistan that he was aged 13  years  3  months.   The  rest  of  his
    evidence was factored in to try and make sense of that date.

44.   He submitted that the claimant's evidence had not been  credible.   He
    had said that he knew what a year was and his nickname arose  from  the
    fact that he was born in the New Year. He said he went once a  week  to
    the mosque but had no understanding of the concept of a month until  he
    came to this country and yet his mother had told him  that  he  was  13
    years 3 months old.  In his first age assessment he had given a  number
    of time periods in months as well as in days.  He  had  said  that  the
    minimum school age was 6 and he had given extraordinary evidence  about
    when he first went to school and discovered that he had  to  be  6  but
    nonetheless was still able to start  school  because  he  persisted  in
    attending.  If his account was correct his departure  from  Afghanistan
    was organised in a matter of six or seven days.  He was  leaving  home,
    so he claimed, as a 13 year old and being sent to another  country  but
    he was not provided with food, clothes, money or  a  phone.   The  only
    piece of information he was given was his age. It was incredible that a
    13 year old would leave Afghanistan in such circumstances.

45.   He argued  that  Ms  Mejzini's  evidence  could  not  be  regarded  as
    reliable or independent as in effect she was a member of his  team  and
    had simply  made  an  informal  age  assessment  after  taking  up  the
    claimant's case.  He submitted that little  if  any  weight  should  be
    given to the reports from Ms Fehrman.   Although  permission  had  been
    given to rely on her reports the witness had not attended to give  oral
    evidence and so could not be cross-examined.   He  submitted  that  her
    reports were unusual documents. In substance they were  a  critique  of
    the reports prepared by the defendant's social workers and were further
    tarnished by  the  generalised  inferences  in  para  16.4  that  local
    authorities were not objective in their age assessments.  He  submitted
    that the evidence from Ms Dennis was clear and had not been  shaken  in
    cross-examination. It could hardly be possible that the claimant  could
    have been confused with a Somali boy.  Weight should also be  given  to
    Ms Austin's evidence that the claimant fitted in well  with  16  to  19
    year olds.  Four social workers had been   involved  in  assessing  the
    claimant's  age and no one had taken the view that he was  the  age  he
    claimed.  He submitted that they had carried  out  careful  assessments
    which should be given due weight.  They had accepted that  some  things
    could have been  done differently and conceded that other  things could
     have been better done. He relied on the dental evidence and the  joint
    statement from both experts.  The tooth x-ray was taken  in  June  2010
    and the probabilities were that the claimant was over the age of 16  at
    that time.  He submitted when all these factors were taken into account
    the likelihood was that the claimant's  age  was  as  assessed  by  the
    defendant.

46.    Ms  Luh  confirmed  that  the  Tribunal's  task  was   to   establish
    chronological age as an objective fact. It was necessary  to  establish
    the chronology of the claimant's life taking into  account  ethnic  and
    cultural information and where  there  were  elements  of  doubt,  they
    should be resolved in his favour.  She submitted that he  had  given  a
    credible chronology.  His account had been accepted by the  immigration
    judge.  She conceded that the  judge's  finding  was  not  binding  but
    submitted that there would need to be clear reasoning before a decision
    maker could depart from it.  She argued  that  the  claimant  had  been
    remarkably consistent in his  chronological  account  of  his  life  in
    Afghanistan and how he came to know what his age was.  He had said that
    he did not start fasting for the full month of Ramadan when he  was  in
    Afghanistan because he was too young but as customary, he had tried  to
    fast for a few days.  He believed that he might have been born in March
    instead of June because he had been known as  his  nickname  Nawroz  by
    family members.

47.   He had explained when he started school and why it  was  that  he  was
    able to start before he was 6.  Just before he left he was told that he
    was 13 years and 3 months.  It was argued that he had said that he  did
    not know the answer to a number of questions and that this  meant  that
    he was being evasive but it was to the claimant's  credit that when  he
    did not know, he did not try to say that he did.  She argued  that  the
    points  taken  by  the  defendant  and  regarded  as  undermining   the
    claimant's  credibility had  a  little  substance.   When  asked  about
    Ramadan he knew that some people could  fast for less than a month  but
    none of the concerns had in any event been explored with him.  What had
    been regarded as a discrepancy when he referred to Khazan and Malik had
    been explained.  She submitted  that  this  had  indicated  a  lack  of
    understanding of the claimant's evidence and a lack of fairness on  the
    defendant's part.  There were no inconsistencies in the account he gave
    about helping on  the  farm.   This  left  no  inconsistencies  of  any
    consequence.

48.   The claimant was, she submitted, a bright young man who  had  given  a
    reasonably  consistent  chronology  with  only   a   very   few   minor
    inconsistencies. She argued that it would be wrong to draw any  adverse
    inference from the evidence of Ms Austin who  had  given  her  evidence
    with great care.  She had not been asked whether the claimant stood out
    because of his young age but whether he was someone at the right  level
    academically.  It was clear that all those who came into  contact  with
    the claimant regarded him as a polite, sociable young  man.  There  had
    been  no appropriate adult at the first age assessment and it  was  the
    claimant's  case that none was offered for the second one. This  was  a
    glaring omission which undermined the age assessment.  So  far  as  the
    medical  evidence  was  concerned,  this  could  not  be  regarded   as
    determinative and it was  clear  that  there  would  be  cases  falling
    outside the average.  In summary, the claimant had given a credible and
    consistent account which confirmed that his age was as he claimed.

The Law

49.   In R (A) v London Borough of Croydon [2009] UKSC 8 the  Supreme  Court
    held that in cases  involving  the  exercise  of  a  local  authority's
    statutory obligations in respect of a child, age was a  matter  subject
    to determination by the courts as a precedent fact.  In R (KN) v London
    Borough of Barnet [2011] EWHC 2019 His Honour Judge Pearl having  heard
    arguments about the burden of proof and  the  proper  approach  to  age
    assessment said:

         "17. I do not believe that there is  a  really  any  difference  in
             approach as between Langstaff J and Neil Garnam QC on the  one
             hand and Ouseley J on the other hand. It is  my  view  in  age
             assessment cases, that  the  court  is  faced,  in  the  first
             instance with having to reach a view on the basis of  all  the
             evidence as to the age of the claimant, and  if  possible  the
             claimant's  date of birth.  The judge will have the benefit of
             evidence presented,  in  many  cases  (but  not  all)  by  the
             claimant himself or herself, as well as the  reports,  witness
             statements and evidence from the social  workers  who  carried
             out the assessment. There may well also be evidence  presented
             on behalf of the claimant which serves as expert  evidence  in
             support of the claim.


         18. All of  this  evidence  has  to  be  assessed  by  the  judge,
             regardless of any question of who has the burden of proof.  In
             many respects  this  exercise  is  similar  (at  least  in  my
             experience), for example, to assessments made  by  courts  and
             tribunals whether the person has or has not a mental disorder,
             whether a child has or has  not  a  special  educational  need
             requiring educating in a particular school, whether  a  person
             is suitable or is not suitable to work  with  children  and/or
             vulnerable adults, and whether a care plan  is  or  is  not  a
             choate care plan enabling a court to agree to a care order  in
             respect of a child.


         19.      Of course, if the court is  unable  to  reach  a  decision
             after conducting the assessment exercise, it will have to fall
             back on the burden of proof, as Ouseley J acknowledged:

                  'It is for the claimant to show that he is or was under 18
                  at the time that he asserts a duty was owed to  him  as  a
                  child.'


         20.      This approach, namely to make  an  assessment  first,  and
             only  if  the  evidence  as  presented  does  not  enable   an
             assessment to be made, to fall back on the burden of proof, is
             particularly relevant in age assessments cases because it must
             be  remembered  that  a  local  authority,  in  reaching   its
             assessment that a person is over 18, should already have given
             this person the 'benefit of the doubt'."

50.  After the hearing we were referred to the  judgment  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in R (C J by his litigation friend SW) and Cardiff City  Council
    [2011] EWCA Civ 1590 where in [21] Pitchford LJ said:


         "...I do not consider that the appellant can have it both ways.  It
         seems to me that once the court is invited to make a decision  upon
         jurisdictional fact it can do no more than  apply  the  balance  of
         probability to the  issue  without  resorting  to  the  concept  of
         discharge of a burden of proof.  In my view, a distinction needs to
         be made between a legal burden of proof, on the  one  hand,  and  a
         sympathetic assessment of evidence on the other.  I accept that  in
         evaluating the evidence it may well  be  inappropriate   to  expect
         from the appellant conclusive evidence of age and circumstances  in
         which he has  arrived  unattended  and  without  original  identity
         documents.  The nature of the evaluation of  evidence  will  depend
         upon the particular facts of the case."

51.   We therefore accept in accordance with the submissions  made  by  both
    counsel in their subsequent notes that neither  the  claimant  nor  the
    defendant has a burden of proving the fact of age but  it  is  for  the
    court to enquire and on the basis  of  the  evidence  produced  make  a
    decision on the balance of probabilities.

52.   We also heard submissions on the approach which  should  be  taken  to
    the findings of the immigration judge who accepted  that  the  claimant
    was the age he claimed to be rather than that put forward by the  local
    authority.  Ms Luh accepted that this finding was not determinative but
    should be regarded as persuasive.  In our view the proper  approach  is
    to accept that finding as part of the background and context  in  which
    this hearing is set.  As it  was  a  finding  made  by  an  independent
    tribunal we must give it proper  weight  but  in  the  context  of  the
    evidence before us.

Assessment of the Evidence of the Claimant's Age

53.   We now turn to our assessment of  the  evidence  we  have  heard.  The
    claimant has been  described  by a number of witnesses as being polite,
    respectful and sociable.  Having heard him give evidence we also  found
    him generally to be a pleasant and personable young man.  The  claimant
    was asked about a recent incident which the  police  are  investigating
    but there was insufficient  evidence  from  which  we  could  draw  any
    adverse inference about his credibility and we have disregarded it when
    assessing his evidence.  However, we do have considerable  difficulties
    with a number of aspects of his evidence  which  have  led  us  to  the
    conclusion that he is not reliable when giving evidence about his  age.
    In his oral evidence he said that he had not known  what  a  month  was
    before he left Afghanistan, as opposed to a year  or  a  week,  but  he
    learned this by the time he reached the UK.  We  do  not  believe  that
    this is the case.  At his screening interview and first age  assessment
    he gave not only his age in years  and  months  but  also  described  a
    number of other periods of time in terms of months.  He claimed that he
    had not known how old he  was  until  shortly  before  he  was  leaving
    Afghanistan when he was told that he needed to  know  that  he  was  13
    years 3 months.  He claims that he only became aware of  months  during
    his journey.  It is not credible that he would  have  either  not  have
    known or would not have asked what a month was  when  leaving  in  such
    circumstances particularly as he  said  that  he  was  given  no  other
    information, instructions or advice about the journey and that he  left
    without any information about the provision of food, clothes  or  means
    of contacting his family.

54.   If his account is correct his departure was arranged in a  very  short
    time through the village elder, the Malik, including the sale of family
    land to pay the agent.  We do not believe that  the  arrangements  were
    likely to have been made with such  speed  and  we  have  doubts  about
    whether the claimant's journey took only two and a half to three months
    as he claimed.  In his oral evidence the claimant said that he had been
    in Greece for four to five days whereas it had previously been his case
    certainly in the documentary evidence that he had  been  there  for  45
    days.   No  challenge  was  made  to  this  issue  by  the   claimant's
    representatives the RMJ at that  time  in  an  otherwise  comprehensive
    response to the Secretary of State's evidence: see the letter from  the
    RMJ at 8.1, 8.9.

55.   The claimant accepted that he had sought to  correct  the  information
    he had given during his first age assessment when he said that  he  had
    met the other boy who was being interviewed in Greece.  He subsequently
    corrected that to say it was in England and now in fact says that  they
    had met in France and that this is what he said to the social  workers.
    In some respects these discrepancies in the evidence  relate  to  minor
    matters but in our judgment they illustrate that when the  claimant  is
    pressed on an issue he will say what he  feels  best  serves  his  case
    rather than give a truthful answer.

56.   We have not found the claimant's account  of  the  chronology  of  his
    life to be reliable.  Further issues relating to when he went to school
    we consider later but we are satisfied that this illustrates an attempt
    by the claimant to fit facts around his claimed age.  His evidence  was
    that children did not go to school in  his area  until  6  but  he  was
    taken earlier.  He said that the school refused to admit him  and  that
    there was a conversation between the head teacher and his mother but he
    did not hear what his mother had  said  about  his  age.   Nonetheless,
    according to him, although he was too young for school he was  admitted
    shortly after due to his persistence in  going  along  with  the  other
    boys.  If his account is correct he must have known his age at least to
    the extent of knowing that he started school before he was 6 and yet he
    sought to maintain a claim that he did not know his age until  he  left
    Afghanistan.

57.   However, despite the unreliability  of  his  evidence  about  his  age
    there is one particular aspect to which we give some weight: his  claim
    that he was born at or about the time of the New Year  because  of  his
    nickname Nawroz.

58.   We heard evidence from Ms Mejzini who  was  strongly  of  the  opinion
    that the claimant was the age he claimed.  We do not  doubt  that  this
    view is genuinely held by her and we appreciate  the  good  work  being
    done by the Refugee Council,  particularly  in  the  light  of  current
    financial constraints.  However, Ms Mejzini's assessment  is  based  on
    her impressions formed of the claimant on the occasions  when  she  has
    met him mainly in the context of preparation for his legal  proceedings
    and inevitably is based on her subjective assessment and belief in this
    context.

59.   The claimant relied on two independent social worker reports  prepared
    by Ms Fehrman.  The first report of 26 March 2010 had been in front  of
    the immigration judge and in the light of  the  fact  that  the  second
    report was prepared dated 6 August  2011,  the  defendant  assumed,  as
    indeed did we, that she would be called to give oral evidence. When  it
    became apparent that she would not, Mr Swirsky objected to her evidence
    being admitted.  We took the view that this  would  not  be  the  right
    course and that her reports should remain in evidence.   However,  when
    considering the weight to be attached to them we must take into account
    the fact that the author has not been subject to cross-examination.

60.   We do have considerable concerns about these reports.  In  so  far  as
    it is being put forward as an age  assessment  in  its  own  right,  as
    opposed to a critique of the defendant's age assessment,  it  was  only
    completed by one social worker and her area of expertise appears to  be
    mental health rather than carrying out age  assessments.  There  is  no
    suggestion in the report that there was an  appropriate  adult  present
    and the assessment was conducted with  relative  speed  as  the  report
    notes the time restriction.  The very brief passage  dealing  with  the
    claimant's journey to the UK at 5.3 illustrates the inadequacy of  this
    report.  A short account is concluded by saying that the  claimant  was
    not able to recollect any other particulars in relation to the journey.
     The comment that either particulars were not sought,  whether  through
    lack of time or a failure to press the issue or that  this  illustrates
    that the claimant was being deliberately vague, seems to us to be  well
    made.

61.   In para 15.22 of  the  second  report  it  is  argued  that  the  2010
    Hounslow assessors contradict themselves on the one hand by citing  the
    claimant's confidence as a positive indicator for him being  older  but
    then describe him as relating to staff "respectfully"  even  under  the
    face  of  challenge,  saying  that  this  respect  indicates  the   age
    difference between the claimant and the adult staff involved shows that
    the claimant could be younger than 18.  It is then said by  Ms  Fehrman
    that the defendant has simultaneously concluded that the claimant is 18
    years old and that he is under 18 years old.  This indicates  to  us  a
    misreading of  the  defendant's  reports  and  we  find  that  no  such
    conclusion could properly be drawn.  Her report also  argues  that  the
    defendant's  assessment  is  evidently  undermined  by  not   providing
    accurate and comprehensive analyses  of  their  decision.  We  are  not
    satisfied that this is a valid criticism.  The reports  of  the  social
    workers are full and comprehensive.  Her report refers to the  conflict
    of interest between the provision of social care and the maintenance of
    immigration control and to research by ILPA that social  work  managers
    place pressure on assessing social workers to gauge children  as  older
    than they are.

62.   This is a point also made in Ms  Luh's  skeleton  argument  where  she
    referred to a report albeit  not  produced  in  evidence.   Ms  Fehrman
    comments that it  is  essential  that  this  conflict  of  interest  is
    recognised and says that there is no acknowledgement of it in either of
    the 2009 or the 2010 reports.  We accept the evidence from  the  social
    workers about the number of assessments they have carried  out  and  we
    are not satisfied that this is a valid criticism of the age  assessment
    reports carried out in the present  case.   We  find  that  the  social
    workers have carried out their obligations objectively and have made an
    assessment of the defendant's age  unaffected by any pressure  to  give
    him an age older than they believe  him to be.

63.   Ms Fehrman's approach is  encapsulated in para  16.7  where  she  says
    that her view is that there is no credible evidence on the  balance  of
    probabilities to indicate that the claimant's   assertion  that  he  is
    aged 15 is untrue and that she concludes that his  age  is  as  he  has
    claimed.  This approach might carry some weight if the evidence of  the
    defendant's social workers and the  dental  evidence  can  properly  be
    discounted and if  the claimant's  evidence is reliable on the issue of
    age but we have found that that is not the case.   In  summary,  whilst
    the evidence in these reports is of some use to highlight matters which
    can properly be investigated in the social workers' evidence,  it  does
    not  in the light of the  evidence  as  a  whole  provide  any  further
    assistance to us in our assessment of the claimant's age.

64.   We now turn to the evidence of the social  workers.   Four  have  been
    involved directly in the two age assessments.  We heard  oral  evidence
    from three, the other being unavailable as she is abroad.  As  we  have
    already indicated, we accept that the social workers carried out  their
    age assessments honestly and objectively. The first age assessment on 8-
    10 September 2009 recorded that the claimant's  physical  features  are
    well defined and his skin texture was well weathered in a  way  unusual
    for a young person of 13.  We accept the  evidence  that  when  he  was
    asked at what age young people starting fasting during Ramadan, he said
    that this was when they were 15.  He was then asked why he was  fasting
    as he was 13 and not 15 and he said  that  initially  he  felt  ashamed
    because everyone in his bed and  breakfast  where  he  was  living  was
    fasting but later commented that he was fasting because his mother  was
    not there to stop him.  We do not  accept  this  explanation.   We  are
    satisfied that this answer  is  an  explanation  given  to  attempt  to
    explain an  otherwise  inconsistent  answer  rather  than  an  accurate
    reflection of the reasons he was fasting.  The report also records  the
    fact that during the assessment he had said that he and  another  young
    person being assessed had met in Greece and subsequently  altered  this
    to say that they had met in England (although he now maintains that  it
    was France) and not seen each other on the journey  at  all.   We  find
    that there  is  some  substance  in  the  comment  recorded  that  this
    discrepancy shows that the claimant and his friend had collaborated and
    discussed what to say in order to prove consistency  in  their  claimed
    ages.

65.   The second age assessment  took  place  in  October  2010.   This  was
    carried out  by  Ms  Kayne  and  Mr  Leroy.   It  was  conducted  as  a
    reassessment following the report prepared by Ms Fehrman,  one  of  the
    criticisms being the lack of an appropriate adult for the reassessment.
    We do not accept that the  claimant  was  not  offered  an  appropriate
    adult. We accept that this offer was not recorded in the  notes.   Both
    social workers conceded that it would have been better if it  had  been
    recorded and that in any event this is the general practice. The report
    refers to a number of inconsistencies in the claimant's account some of
    which they now accept have been adequately explained.  The  discrepancy
    relating to whether the Khazan and the Malik were different people  has
    been explained and accepted and it is also accepted that  there  is  no
    inconsistency in what the claimant said about whether he helped out  or
    worked on  his  family's  farm.   These  discrepancies  which  are  now
    acknowledged to be incorrect do not in  our  view  affect  the  overall
    conclusions or the weight we should attach to this report.  The  report
    points out inconsistent dates and information regarding  his  education
    and the normal starting age for school in Afghanistan.   We  find  that
    these are significant discrepancies and that his explanation about when
    he started school and how long he  was  there  could  justifiably  give
    cause for concern about that aspect  of  the  chronology.   The  social
    workers took into account the  claimant's   physical  appearance  as  a
    young person with well defined facial features including a strong  jaw,
    visible lines or wrinkles across his forehead,  some  acne  and  facial
    hair that was shaved for both interviews and his demeanour as an  image
    conscious young person who confidently wore bright coloured clothing to
    both interviews.  In summary we accept that the interview  records  are
    accurate records and there was in the evidence  before  them  a  proper
    basis on which they could reasonably reach the view that it was  likely
    that as at that date the claimant was aged 17 years.  For  this  reason
    in our assessment of the claimant we give weight to their assessment of
    his age.

66.   We also heard evidence  from  Ms  Dennis.   The  significance  of  her
    evidence is that on 9 June 2011, if she is correct, the claimant had  a
    conversation with another student at the IEC and was heard to say  that
    he was 17, the other student replying that  he  should  not  bother  to
    attend as he was over the age of compulsory  education.   The  claimant
    denies that he ever  said  this  but  gave  evidence  about  a  similar
    conversation but that the age of 17 was given  by  the  person  he  was
    speaking to and not by him.  We have no hesitation  in  preferring  the
    evidence of Ms Dennis on this matter.   She  came  across  as  a  kind,
    conscientious person with no reason for telling us something  that  she
    had not in fact heard. We have considered whether she might  have  been
    mistaken or misunderstood what was being said but  we  do  not  believe
    this to be the case.  Her  evidence  was  that  the  claimant  normally
    avoided questions about his age or said that he  was  15  but  on  this
    occasion he said that he was 17.  Bearing in mind  what  we  have  said
    about the claimant's tendency to say what fits the need of the  moment,
    we have considered whether he was being truthful about his age on  this
    occasion or whether he was upping his age perhaps to impress the  other
    young man he was speaking to. On balance we have come to the view  that
    on this occasion the claimant was giving his right age.

67.   We also heard evidence from Ms Austin whose evidence we  also  accept.
    She said that when she was phoned by the social worker to give  a  view
    about how the claimant had been fitting in at college she gave a fairly
    quick reply but she confirmed that it remained her  view  that  he  had
    fitted in well with the age group in which he had been placed.

68.   So far as the dental evidence is concerned, as  we  have  already  set
    out, there is substantial if not complete agreement between Dr  Marsden
    and Professor Roberts. They prepared their reports and provided a joint
    statement which indicated the extent of their agreement.   As  we  have
    already indicated we were prepared to admit the further  letter  of  18
    November 2011  with  some  hesitation  but  in  substance  that  simply
    confirms that the experts have behaved professionally and  we  entirely
    agree with the comment made by Professor Roberts in that letter that as
    an expert required to have  a  joint  meeting  to  discuss  dental  age
    assessment, he could hardly not  put  forward  his  own  data  base  if
    relevant to the matters in issue.  An expert should not be artificially
    constrained in carrying out his  responsibilities  to  the  court.   In
    summary, in light of the joint statement we are satisfied that the mean
    age of a Caucasian male with the claimant's stage  of  development  for
    the third molar in June 2010 would be 16.57 using the King's data  base
    whereas Dr Marsden had referred to an average age  for  this  stage  of
    root development as 16.88, or according to a further paper  16.87.   We
    bear in mind that these are mean ages and that  there  will  always  be
    exceptions from the norm.  We note that the probability of  this  stage
    of tooth development for someone of the claimant's claimed age is 1.19%
    and that the probability that a Caucasian male at this stage  would  be
    more than 16 is 69.46%.

69.   Looking at the evidence as a whole we are satisfied that the  claimant
    is not the age he claims to be.   We are not satisfied that he  was  13
    when he left Afghanistan or that he is 15  now.   We  have  taken  into
    account the evidence of Ms Austin and accept that he has been  able  to
    fit in with young people between 16 and 19 without any  real  problems.
    As we have indicated, we have accepted the evidence of Ms  Dennis  that
    on 9 June 2011 the claimant told another student that he  was  17.   If
    the date of birth allocated to the claimant by the local authority of 1
    June 1993 is correct, the claimant would have turned 18 on 1 June 2011.
     If the claimant was in fact 17 on 9 June 2011 his actual date of birth
    would have to fall within the year 10 June 1993 to 9 June 1994.

70.   However, there is one aspect of the claimant's evidence  which  we  do
    not disbelieve and where we have a degree of uncertainty such  that  he
    should be given the benefit of the doubt.  This relates to his evidence
    about his nickname and his belief that he may have been born around the
    time of the New Year which in Afghanistan would  be  about  March.   We
    also note his evidence that his understanding is that it would only  be
    when he was 15 that he would be expected to observe the  full  fast  in
    Ramadan.  We think that this is why the claimant was  fasting  in  this
    country and do not accept that he was undertaking a voluntary fast.

71.   The claimant on his account left Afghanistan  because  of  a  fear  of
    recruitment by the Taliban.  This was accepted by the immigration judge
    but a finding that the claimant was 15 rather  than  13  when  he  left
    would not be inconsistent with the judge's findings about the risk from
    the Taliban. The dental examination was on 14 June 2010 and  his  tooth
    development then was such that there is a high probability that he  was
    over 16 at that date and a very low probability that he was 14.

72.   When we look at the evidence as a whole we assess the claimant's  date
    of birth as 1 March 1994.  We appreciate that this almost certainly  is
    not his actual date of birth but, for the reasons we have given on  the
    evidence  before  us  and  assessing  the  matter  on  a   balance   of
    probabilities, this seems to us to be the most probable date of  birth.
    It is broadly consistent with the dental evidence.  If born on 1  March
    1994 he would be about 16 years 3� months  on  14  June  2010.   It  is
    reasonably close to the assessment made by the social workers and  fits
    well with evidence Ms Austin and Ms Dennis.

73.   We have taken into  account  the  finding  by  the  immigration  judge
    accepting  that  the  claimant's  age  was  as  he  claimed.   However,
    following that the local authority was entitled to make a  reassessment
    and that had to be carried out in the light of all  the  evidence  then
    available. The judge clearly reached a decision properly open to him on
    the evidence before him but in the light of the further evidence before
    us and in particular the dental evidence, the defendant's  reassessment
    and the evidence of Ms Austin and Ms Denis, we have reached a different
    view on this question of fact.

74.   In summary, doing the best we can on the evidence before us we  assess
    the claimant's date of birth as 1 March 1994 and the  defendant  has  a
    duty to provide services to him based on that date.

75.   We make a declaration that the claimant's date of  birth  is  1  March
    1994. The parties may make further written submissions on the terms  of
    any further orders sought and in particular on the issue of costs.   In
    the absence of agreement, the matter will be relisted for further  oral
    submissions on those issues.

Upper Tribunal Judge Latter





























                         APPENDIX: DECISION ON COSTS


1.    In a determination issued to  the  parties  on  8  February  2012  the
    Tribunal made a declaration that the claimant's date  of  birth  was  1
    March 1994.  We gave permission for the parties to make further written
    submissions on  the  issue  of  costs.   We  have  now  received  their
    submissions.

2.    This was an application for judicial review of the  decision  made  by
    the defendant assessing the claimant's date of birth as 1 June 1993  as
    opposed to his claim that it was 1 June 1996.  The  claimant  seeks  an
    order for costs on the basis that the only avenue  by  which  he  could
    resolve the question of his age was by  the  present  proceedings.   He
    argues that the Tribunal assessed his date of birth as  1  March  1994,
    and this means that he was at all material times younger than  assessed
    by the defendant and that until 1 March 2012 he  was  a  child,  as  he
    claimed, not an adult, as contended by the defendant.  He  argues  that
    the defendant had carried out age assessments on two separate occasions
    but had done so erroneously.

3.    In these circumstances, it is  argued  that  the  claimant  should  be
    awarded 50% of his costs but, if the Tribunal is not minded to  do  so,
    the appropriate default order should be no order as to costs.

4.    The defendant argues that the claimant should be ordered  to  pay  its
    costs because this was a case where the  Tribunal  concluded  that  the
    claimant had not been reliable when giving evidence about his  age  and
    it follows that the only inference that can properly be drawn from  the
    findings was that the claimant knew his age and had actively sought  to
    mislead those who had come into contact with him.

5.    We remind ourselves of the provisions of CPR 43.3(4) that in  deciding
    what order if any to make about costs the Tribunal must have regard  to
    all the circumstances including the conduct of the parties and  whether
    a party has succeeded on part of his case, even  if  he  has  not  been
    wholly successful.

6.    We accept that to a limited extent it can be said  that  the  claimant
    has succeeded in  this  application  because  the  Tribunal  reached  a
    different finding  of  fact  from  the  defendant  when  assessing  the
    claimant's age.  However, for the reasons we gave in our full decision,
    we did not find him to be a credible witness and rejected many  of  the
    criticisms made of the defendant and its witnesses.

7.    Taking into account the conduct of the parties, we are satisfied  that
    the proper order in the present case is that there should be  no  order
    as to costs.  There is to be a detailed assessment  of  the  claimant's
    publicly funded costs.
