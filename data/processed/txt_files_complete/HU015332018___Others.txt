Representation:

For the Appellants:    Miss C Patry of Counsel, instructed by Amirthan &

For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, a Senior HOPO of the Specialist Appeals
Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones QC in respect of a decision promulgated on
    27th December 2018 in which  the  learned  Judge  dismissed  the  three
    Appellants' human rights appeals.

 2. Although on the face of the decision it is stated that the hearing  was
    at Hatton Cross  on  23rd  November  2018  it  appears,  and  both  the
    representatives today tell me, that in fact the  hearing  was  on  14th
    December 2018.

 3. At the appeal before me today the  Appellant  is  represented  by  Miss
    Patry of Counsel and the  Secretary  of  State  is  represented  by  Mr
    Tarlow, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

 4. Permission to appeal in  this  case  has  been  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Bulpitt on 16th January 2019.   Within  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal three grounds are asserted.  It was firstly  asserted  that  the
    judge erred in failing to grant an  adjournment  to  enable  instructed
    Counsel to attend the appeal hearing. It is argued by Miss Patry  today
    that the judge procedurally erred and  failed  to  act  fairly  in  not
    granting an adjournment.

 5. Secondly it is argued that the judge failed to  give  adequate  reasons
    for his findings on material matters in respect of the Sponsor's income
    and failed to deal with the actual issue that was originally raised  by
    the Secretary of State in the refusal letter, namely whether or not the
    Sponsor's employment was genuine that had been dealt. And  thirdly  the
    judge failed to consider the best interests of the two children.

 6. Given that one of the Grounds of Appeal related to whether or not Judge
    Jones QC had acted fairly in deciding  not  to  adjourn  the  case  and
    proceeding in circumstances where the  Appellants  were  unrepresented,
    Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor gave Judge Jones QC  the  opportunity  of
    commenting upon that issue. In a letter dated 14th  February  2019  the
    judge said that the Sponsor had said that she would like  to  go  ahead
    even though her solicitor/Counsel failed to turn up.  He said he is not
    in the habit of fabricating the content of a Record of Proceedings  and
    that he actually  had  a  recollection  of  the  case  because  he  was
    surprised that the Sponsor elected to go ahead absent a representative.



 7. At the appeal before me in the  Upper  Tribunal  today,  Mr  Tarlow  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State has quite properly in accordance  with
    his duty to the Tribunal conceded that in respect of the second  Ground
    of Appeal, in terms of whether or not the judge  failed  to  adequately
    consider whether or not the financial requirements were met at the date
    of decision, that the First-tier Tribunal Judge has materially erred in
    failing to consider that issue adequately.

 8. As argued by  Miss  Patry  of  Counsel  the  original  refusal  by  the
    Secretary of State in the refusal letter dated 24th November  2017  was
    on the basis that the Secretary of State was  not  satisfied  that  the
    sponsor was genuinely employed. The  Sponsor  had  said  that  she  was
    employed by Ganapathy CC Limited, but when interviewed on  9th  October
    2017 she said that she worked from 10am to 12pm,  whereas  her  manager
    said that she worked from 12pm to  2pm.   The  Sponsor  said  that  she
    worked two days a week whereas the manager said she worked five days  a
    week and therefore the genuineness of that  employment  was  questioned
    and the Secretary of State was not satisfied  that  she  was  genuinely
    employed and that thereby the financial requirements were met.

 9. Judge Jones QC in his decision at paragraph 4 stated:

         "I should say at the outset that there can be no  basis  whatsoever
         for this appeal whatsoever other than, possibly, Article 8 ECHR.  I
         say that because there was not, and there is, no  prospect  of  the
         Appellants demonstrating that their Sponsor has an annual income of
         �24,800 or more and/or that she had that level of income when their
         respective applications were made.  I so find.  The  evidence  from
         Mr. Annasingham did  nothing  to  prevent  that  rather  inevitable
         conclusion being reached."

10. The evidence however before Judge Jones QC were the witness  statements
    from the Sponsor and from her employer together with a variety of  P60s
    and wage slips.

11. In the Sponsor's statement Mrs Ramajayam stated  in  paragraph  3  that
    evidence of employment came from the  wage  slips  and  bank  statement
    where money was remitted in accordance with the hours mentioned in  the
    wage slips and the P60 which precisely indicated her annual  salary  in
    respect of the employment.  She argued that a careful  perusal  of  the
    document would establish a  constant  sequence  and  stability  of  her
    employment and  that  her  wage  slips,  bank  statement  and  P60  all
    reflected her version of events regarding her employment.

12. There was also a statement from her employer Mr Annasingham who in  his
    statement dated 2nd October 2018 had set  out  how  Mrs  Ramajayam  the
    Sponsor had been employed by his organisation since June 2016 on a part-
    time basis and that he had twenty employees working  on  payroll  apart
    from the casual employees and his wife arranges shifts  for  staff  and
    deals with all other related issues.  He said he recalled receiving two
    phone  calls  referring  to  the  same  verification   and   the   long
    conversation took place whilst he was at home.  He said his answers  to
    questions were from memory  and  at  the  time  he  did  not  have  the
    opportunity of referring to the staff  file  and  he  said  his  direct
    involvement with the staff with regard to their shifts is very  remote.



13. The P60s for the year ending 5th April 2018 have been submitted,  which
    in respect of Ganapathy CC Limited was for in the sum of �5,880  before
    tax which is at page 11 of the Appellants' bundle before the First-tier
    Tribunal and the P60 in respect of the Sponsor's  employment  at  Avery
    Homes Nelson Limited is at page 26 and is in the sum of �23,383.35  for
    the year ending 5th April 2018.

14. From the record of proceedings,  no  questions  were  asked  in  cross-
    examination  of  the  Sponsor   regarding   her   employment   or   the
    discrepancies in the account  regarding  her  employment  as  discussed
    within the original refusal notice.  She was simply asked questions  in
    cross-examination on behalf of the Secretary of State at the First-tier
    Tribunal regarding her  family  life.   As  far  as  her  employer  was
    concerned no questions were asked in cross-examination  at  all  of  Mr
    Annasingham.   He  was  called  to  give  evidence  and  confirmed  his
    statement but no questions were then asked of  him.   His  recollection
    and account of why it was that there were discrepancies  regarding  the
    Sponsor's employment  was  therefore  unchallenged  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

15. Despite that, Judge Jones simply said there  was  no  prospect  of  the
    Appellants demonstrating the Sponsor had an annual  income  of  �24,800
    and/or  that  she  had  that  level  of  income  when  the   respective
    applications were made.  However, the issue taken by the  Secretary  of
    State was whether or not the employment with Ganapathy CC  Limited  was
    genuine rather than whether or  not  she  actually  met  the  level  of
    �24,800 in respect of her  income.   Clearly  there  was  documentation
    before the First-tier Tribunal in respect of her income which at  least
    for the year ending 5th April 2018  was  in  excess  of  that  required
    amount.

16. But the issue before the judge was whether or not that  employment  was
    genuine.  That issue Judge Jones QC has not  dealt  with,  as  properly
    conceded by Mr Tarlow today.  Issue was not taken in the refusal notice
    regarding the level of income and if that was  going  to  be  something
    that Judge Jones QC then wanted to take issue with and find against the
    Appellants on that ground then quite  clearly  the  opportunity  should
    have been given for the Sponsor to deal with that point at the hearing.
     It cannot be the case that a judge can find against an Appellant on  a
    basis which was not raised with the  original  refusal  notice  without
    giving that Appellant the opportunity of dealing with the concerns that
    the judge has on that issue.

17. In that regard it is quite clear that Judge Jones QC has not adequately
    dealt with the actual issue before him regarding the genuineness of the
    Sponsor's employment and has also wrongly taken issue with the level of
    earnings without giving the Appellant and the Sponsor  the  opportunity
    of dealing with that point when the same was not raised in the original
    refusal notice.

18. There is following the case of MK (Duty to  give  reasons)  Pakistan  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  UKUT  641  (IAC)  an
    obligation on a First-tier Judge to give sufficient reasons  to  enable
    the losing party to know why they have lost in an appeal.   Given  that
    in this case the Sponsor has submitted both a  statement  from  herself
    and her employer together with P60s and  wage  slips,  simply  for  the
    judge to say there was no prospect of the Appellants demonstrating  the
    Sponsor had an annual income of �24,800 or more  and/or  that  she  had
    that level of income when  their  respective  applications  were  made,
    fails to explain to the losing party, in this case the Appellants,  why
    that was the case and why their documentary evidence was not acceptable
    or sufficient as far as the judge was concerned.

19. Mr Tarlow quite properly concedes that these are material  errors  such
    that the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Jones QC  is  set  aside
    and the matter is to be remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    rehearing before any First-tier Tribunal Judge other than  Judge  Jones
    QC.

20. Just dealing briefly though with the first Ground of Appeal.  As  Judge
    Jones QC quite properly pointed out, he had asked the  Sponsor  whether
    or  not  she  wanted  to  proceed  in  the   absence   of   her   legal
    representatives.  He had actually gone to the trouble  of  phoning  the
    solicitors to find out why no representative was  there,  going  beyond
    what many First-tier Tribunal Judges would do in  that  regard  and  he
    acted very fairly as far as  the  Appellants  were  concerned  in  that
    regard. to see why their representatives were  not  there  rather  than
    simply proceeding.

21. I have seen a witness statement from  the  Sponsor  dealing  with  that
    issue in which she also quite properly concedes that she was asked  and
    did say that she wanted to go ahead, but she says that she panicked and
    did not really realise the consequences of going ahead and  thought  it
    might go against her if she asked for  an  adjournment.   It  is  quite
    clear from that she did not ask for an adjournment and it has not  been
    suggested that she was misled by Judge Jones QC in any way  to  believe
    that the appeal  may  go  against  her  if  she  did  not  ask  for  an
    adjournment.  She had agreed for the case to go ahead.   I  do  not  in
    those circumstances see that Judge Jones had acted in any way  unfairly
    and did not procedurally err in those circumstances.



Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones QC  does  contain  a
material error of law and is set aside.  The case is remitted  back  to  the
First-tier Tribunal for rehearing before any  judge  other  than  First-tier
Tribunal Geraint Jones QC.

The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not make any order for  anonymity  and  no
such application has been made before me today and therefore I do  not  make
any order for anonymity.
