Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal  brought  by  the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Froom against a decision  of
    the respondent dated 9  December  2014  to  make  a  deportation  order
    against Mr Schmitz who is a citizen of Germany, born  on  22  September
    1985, following various convictions.  For the  sake  of  continuity  we
    shall hereafter refer to the Mr Schmitz as the appellant as he  was  in
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The convictions for which he was sentenced to a period of  three  years
    and two months were  serious.   He  was  convicted,  according  to  the
    sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Sheridan on  16  July  2013,  to
    have been convicted of a knifepoint robbery  at  a  petrol  station  in
    Milton Keynes where he chose to rob the operator of the filling station
    at knifepoint and succeeded in gaining between �30 and �40.  The  judge
    took as his starting point that the appellant should be sentenced to  a
    period of four years.

 3. There was another indictment in which the appellant  was  convicted  of
    stealing, by way of burglary, property from the owner of a  house  whom
    he knew and indeed who had provided him with support and accommodation.
     Finally there was an account of the appellant mugging a victim who was
    an elderly woman on a bicycle.   He  grabbed  her  bag  and  she  found
    herself being dragged along and suffered some minor injury as a result.
     The judge was minded to make  this  a  consecutive  sentence  of  some
    eighteen months' imprisonment but in the event concluded that it should
    properly be served concurrently. As a result of that he  was  sentenced
    to a total of 38 months' imprisonment.

 4. The appellant as a citizen  of  the  European  Union  came  before  the
    Tribunal on the basis of the  provision  contained  principally  within
    Regulation 26 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 and in particular the provisions which relate to  the  removal  of
    citizens of the European Union.  The judge considered the evidence that
    was relied upon by the respondent in support of the decision to  remove
    him, notwithstanding  his  European  citizenship.   It  considered  the
    potential  intervention   of   the   Multi-Agency   Public   Protection
    Arrangements (MAPPA), level 1, which is designed to protect the  public
    against future risk.  He took  into  account  the  seriousness  of  the
    offences and the consequences of those  involved.   He  looked  at  the
    appellant's attitude  towards  offending  and  the  fact  that  he  the
    appellant had failed to give any proper thought to the consequences  of
    his actions and that his victims had been left traumatised.

 5. The OASys Report which had been prepared found that the appellant posed
    a high risk of harm to the public immediate upon his  release  and  the
    factors which were relevant to that assessment were  his  thinking  and
    behavioural  deficits,  his  substance  misuse,  his  associates,   the
    financial difficulties in which he found himself and his attitudes  and
    beliefs in relation to his own chosen lifestyle.  It was considered  by
    the offender manager that the appellant posed  a  medium  risk  of  re-
    offending.

 6. The Secretary of State also relied upon  the  fact  that  there  was  a
    period in which the appellant descended  into  a  spiral  of  disorder,
    first having lost his job, then  having  found  himself  without  money
    taking upon himself to commit acquisitive offences  and  then  misusing
    drugs as a result of the gains that he  had  made.   In  all  of  those
    circumstances the respondent took into account that it was a case where
    the applicant had failed to address  his  offending  pattern.   It  was
    therefore on that very negative basis which was fully recorded  by  the
    judge in the determination that he set about his  task  in  considering
    whether as a person who had a permanent right of residence there  were,
    in accordance with reg. 21(3) 'serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or
    public security' for making the decision which  itself  had  to  accord
    with the principles of  proportionality.   In  this  case  because  the
    applicant had a permanent right of residence the grounds had to be what
    are described as 'serious grounds'.

 7. The appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2006 or 2007 when he
    was aged 21 and had been in the  United  Kingdom  since  then  although
    there may have been occasions when he had left from time  to  time  for
    short periods.  That was the basis upon which the  judge  assessed  the
    test that was before him.  He considered the terms of  the  Regulations
    and the relevant case law and in  paragraph  19  onwards  he  made  the
    following findings of fact.

 8. He considered the importance in the appeal of a brother called  Patrick
    who was then involved  in  an  extended  training  course  in  Germany.
    Patrick was involved in a haulage business.  That was a business  which
    was operating in the United Kingdom although  he  had  been  undergoing
    training in Germany.  It was his suggestion that the appellant could be
    provided with employment in that business.  The judge  also  took  into
    account the appellant's  troubled  employment  history.   He  had  been
    employed at one stage as a cashier in a petrol station.  That was a job
    that he held for two years and  he  had  thereafter  taken  work  in  a
    warehouse and  subsequently  in  a  German-speaking  customer  services
    business.  However the evidence was that the loss of that job for which
    he blamed his employers had caused the escalation in  the  problems  he
    faced.  It had resulted in his  offending  for  which  the  courts  had
    subsequently imposed sentences of imprisonment.

 9. The link between the appellant's  offending  and  his  drug  abuse  was
    obvious.  T he question for the judge was the threat that ('a  genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society') the appellant posed to society as  a
    result of that offending.  The judge looked at the OASys  Report  which
    was prepared by the appellant's offender management and he acknowledged
    that it deserved to be given significant weight in any assessment  that
    the judge was required to carry out.  He looked at the attitude of  the
    appellant in as far as his offending was concerned.  He concluded  that
    the appellant took responsibility for what  had  occurred  although  he
    certainly sought on occasions to place the blame on others, for example
    on the drug dealer and  the  financial  position  in  which  he  placed
    himself.  The judge was concerned  that,  although  the  appellant  was
    involved in a crime reduction initiative,  he  had  only  attended  one
    appointment and he looked to the effect of the appellant's attending  a
    CARATS (counselling assessment referral advice and through care) course
    which was designed to minimise his re-offending.

10. It is a marked feature of this case that the appellant  has  sought  to
    minimise his own involvement.  He denied that he posed any risk to  the
    public and was liable to blame others for the difficulties in which  he
    faced himself.  That was seen as a  feature  in  the  report  that  was
    prepared by  Dr  Lilley,  an  independent  psychologist,  whose  report
    featured largely in the determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.
     It is a report which is  broadly  sympathetic  to  the  appellant  and
    concluded that the appellant had some partial insight into  his  recent
    problems and partial insight into the way that those could  be  met  in
    the future.  It was the conclusion of Dr Lilley who is  undoubtedly  an
    expert in these fields that the appellant would  face  a  smaller  risk
    than was assessed in the OASys Report provided that there was a  robust
    risk of management and  supervision  plan  put  in  place.  It  was  Dr
    Lilley's opinion that the appellant should be encouraged to make use of
    the offender manager upon his release in order to avoid re-offending.

11. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not hold back on the scepticism  that
    he attached to some of the evidence of the appellant.  For example,  in
    paragraph 33 of the determination, he agreed that the appellant had  to
    an extent sought to blame others to minimise his own responsibility for
    his actions.  Indeed he said that in  cross-examination  the  appellant
    was at some times 'contemptuous' of the questions that were  being  put
    to him by the  Presenting  Officer.   He  was  also  sceptical  of  the
    appellant's claim that the offence which involved the use  of  a  knife
    was not pre-planned and he came to the view that there was some element
    of pre-planning in the  robbery  offences.   Consequently  that  was  a
    matter which undoubtedly weighed against the appellant.  He  also  took
    into account what Dr Lilley said about this and that the absence of any
    frank self-assessment of the appellant's own wrongdoing may  have  been
    as a result of a feeling of shame.

12. The Immigration Judge had the benefit of hearing from  the  appellant's
    mother described as Ms Shah.  She used as some  justification  for  the
    appellant's misconduct the fact that there had been and was a bountiful
    supply of drugs in Milton Keynes.  However  that  overlooked  the  fact
    that the appellant had in fact been  misusing  drugs  long  before  his
    arrival in the United Kingdom and this had started at about the age  of
    13.  In addition, the judge took into account the fact that his  mother
    was fighting for her son's right to remain in the  United  Kingdom  and
    she could therefore be forgiven for a degree of  exaggeration  in  some
    parts of the evidence.  It was clear that  she  was  embarrassed  about
    some parts of the questioning that  was  conducted  by  the  Presenting
    Officer.  It is therefore not the case that the judge did not  adopt  a
    balanced view in  his  assessment  either  of  the  appellant  and  his
    failings or the appellant's mother and her tendency to 'gild the  lily'
    as far as some of the evidence was concerned about her son's behaviour.



13.  He  was  similarly  sceptical  about  the  evidence  provided  by  the
    appellant's brother as to the employment prospects of the appellant  in
    the company which was run by his brother in the United Kingdom.   There
    was little evidence of the profitability of the business and the  judge
    concluded that the information which emerged at the  hearing  was  that
    the offer of  employment  provided  by  the  brother  was  speculative.
    Nevertheless, having heard the evidence of the appellant's mother,  who
    was a shareholder in the business, the judge was satisfied that it  was
    likely at some point in the future that a job  would  become  available
    for him and that would provide a tangible  goal.   The  possibility  of
    secure employment was therefore seen as one of the means by  which  the
    cycle of offending might be broken.

14. The ultimate conclusion that was made  by  the  judge  is  set  out  in
    paragraph 39 of his determination.  He properly  applied  the  test  of
    'serious grounds of public policy or public security' being required to
    be shown for deporting this appellant.  He looked at  the  entirety  of
    the appellant's offending and accepted that the serious  offending  was
    confined to a short period of time and this coincided with a period  of
    unemployment, domestic instability and heavy drug and alcohol use.   He
    concluded that this inevitably resulted in the  appellant  posing  some
    risk of re-offending if those setbacks are once again a feature of life
    and that he comes to a future  with  a  damaged  pedigree  but  he  was
    prepared to take a positive view that the appellant had  stopped  using
    drugs and alcohol whilst in prison notwithstanding  the  obvious  point
    that this is something one  would  expect  in  the  confined  space  of
    imprisonment.

15. He then went on to consider the prospects of this appellant.   He  came
    to the conclusion that there were support mechanisms that  would  offer
    the appellant a future which was not provided in Germany.   The  future
    was in part related to  the  support  that  will  be  provided  by  the
    Probation Services.  It was a future that was in part provided  by  the
    support that was present in the United Kingdom through his  family  and
    it was a future which was in part provided by  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant had a prospect of finding work at some time in the future  in
    the business run by his brother.  All of those circumstances were taken
    into account by the judge in looking at  whether  there  was  a  robust
    mechanism which was there to support the appellant.  He found that,  on
    balance, the conclusions reached by the OASys Report had been  to  some
    extent undermined by the evidence of Dr Lilley and his assessment  that
    the risk was low to medium provided  that  robust  supervision  was  in
    place.

16. Significantly, however, in paragraph 43 of the  determination  he  also
    concluded that, even if there was a difference as he accepted there was
    between the OASys Report and the report of Dr  Lilley,  he  reached  an
    alternative conclusion that, even if the truth  lay  somewhere  between
    the two, for the reasons that he had provided he was not satisfied that
    serious grounds of public policy or public security had been  made  out
    to justify the deportation of the appellant.

17. This was a determination which covered some fourteen pages and some  43
    paragraphs and there is no suggestion made on the part of the Secretary
    of State that the judge overlooked any part of  the  material  evidence
    that was submitted in favour of the appellant or indeed  in  favour  of
    the respondent.  It is therefore a true rationality challenge  made  by
    the Secretary of State that the judge was not  entitled  to  reach  the
    conclusion that he did.  That is the burden of the  grounds  of  appeal
    which were advanced by the Secretary of State in support of the appeal.
     The grounds assert that the  OASys  Report  which  had  identified  an
    increased risk of harm to the public and a medium risk of  re-offending
    should have been preferred in place of the report by Dr Lilley and that
    the failure to do so amounted to an error of law.  Whilst  it  is  said
    there was a conflict between the two professional reports, this did not
    explain why Dr Lilley's views should be  preferred  simply  because  he
    advocated a robust programme of supervision.  However, in our judgment,
    the view that was adopted by the judge was to look at the OASys  Report
    in some detail and the reasons advanced by the Secretary  of  State  in
    deciding upon the course of deportation.  To take those into account on
    the one hand but also to take into account on the  other  the  evidence
    that the appellant had provided and the evidence that came from  family
    members and the evidence that was to be found in the material about the
    risk of re-offending and to conclude that Dr Lilley's  report  and  his
    rather more optimistic assessment of the future was  one  that  he  was
    entitled to prefer.

18. It is perfectly plain that other judges might have reached a  different
    conclusion as far as this material was  concerned  and  some  may  have
    concluded that although  there  was  a  system  of  support  which  was
    advocated on behalf of the appellant, that system of  support  was  not
    adequate for the robust programme of supervision  and  monitoring  that
    was required and advocated by Dr Lilley.  However that is not the issue
    which is before us.  The issue before us is whether there was a failure
    on the part of the First-tier Tribunal to reach a conclusion  that  the
    Secretary of State was not entitled to reach the finding that she  did.
    In our judgment it was open to the judge to conclude, on balance,  that
    the report of Dr Lilley added weight to the appellant's claim  that  he
    did not pose a serious risk.  The Upper Tribunal  in  its  jurisdiction
    cannot intervene unless it is established that  that  approach  by  the
    judge was an unlawful one and we do not do so.   The  outcome  in  this
    case is  that  the  judge  reached  a  sustainable  conclusion  on  the
    evidence.  Matters do not however rest there.

19. The appellant has been lucky perhaps in the outcome that he  has  found
    himself to have benefited from.  These were very serious offences which
    were committed.  They were offences which were related to his misuse of
    drugs - a misuse of drugs which has now lasted for a period of at least
    thirteen years or so.

20. If there is to be any further recurrence of misbehaviour  on  his  part
    then it will be clear that both the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  and  Dr
    Lilley were misguided in their  assessment  that  there  was  a  robust
    system of protection provided to the public.  In that event, were there
    to be any further misbehaving on the part of the appellant,  there  can
    be no doubt whatever that a very different view would be  taken  as  to
    the risk that is posed.

21. If there is to be a recurrence of drug-related  offences,  particularly
    the offences relating to violence, then these will show that the  trust
    which has been placed in the appellant by the Tribunal and by Dr Lilley
    were misplaced and that the appellant does indeed present a risk to the
    public such as to fall within the  ambit  of  the  expression  'serious
    grounds of public policy or public security'.  In  those  circumstances
    his removal is almost inevitable.  For this reason it is  important  at
    this stage for  the  appellant  to  know  that  this  is  not  a  final
    conclusion upon the appellant's behaviour, that it is only one stage of
    it.  If there is to  be  a  recurrence  of  the  misconduct  which  has
    occurred in the past,  then  it  will  almost  certainly  result  in  a
    different outcome.  The words which we are  using  at  the  moment  are
    being recorded.  They will be provided in writing.  It will be for  the
    appellant to make what use of them he chooses.  But if he fails to make
    proper use of them, then it is obvious what the outcome will be.

DECISION

               1) The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.

               2) The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no error on a point  of
                  law and the original determination of the appeal  allowing
                  the appeal of Mr Schmitz shall stand.
