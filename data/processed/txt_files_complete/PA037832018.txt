               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

Representation:

                    Appellant


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Anonymity

    Direction Regarding Anonymity -  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

    Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  Appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify her.  This direction applies both to the  Appellant
    and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply  with  this  direction  could
    lead to contempt of court proceedings.



 1. The Secretary of State with permission, appeals against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Young-Harry (hereinafter referred to  as  the
    "FtTJ"), who, in a determination promulgated on the 7th November  2018,
    allowed  CO's  protection  claim  on  human  rights  grounds   (Article
    3/humanitarian protection grounds).

 2. Although the Secretary of State is the Appellant before  the  Tribunal,
    we will for ease of reference refer to him as the Respondent as he  was
    the Respondent in the First-tier Tribunal.  Similarly we will refer  to
    CO as the Appellant as she was  the  Appellant  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

The background:

 3. The Appellant's immigration history and factual background is  set  out
    within the determination and in the papers  before  the  Tribunal.  The
    Appellant is a national of Ghana who claims to have arrived  in  United
    Kingdom in 2004.

 4. In February 2010 she applied for leave to remain in the UK and  an  EEA
    residence card. That application was refused in July 2010.

 5. On 14 August 2013 she was  convicted  at  the  magistrate's  court  for
    failing to surrender to custody and was fined �55 and  ordered  to  pay
    the victim surcharge of �20.

 6. On 26 September 2014 she was served with an IS.15A as a  person  liable
    to be removed from the United Kingdom which resulted in an  application
    made by her in March 2015 for leave to remain on the  basis  of  having
    accrued 10 years residence (on the basis of her private life).

 7. On 15 April 2016 she was convicted at the Crown Court of possessing  or
    controlling identity documents with intent to which she  was  sentenced
    to a period of 12 months imprisonment.

 8. As a result, on 21 April 2016 a stage I deportation decision was issued
    to her. She responded to that  letter  asserting  that  she  could  not
    return to her country of residence and raising  issues  relevant  to  a
    protection claim and  also  based  on  her  mental  health.  An  asylum
    interview was held in June 2016.

 9. On 27 July 2016 a deportation order was signed and on the 28 July  2016
    a decision was made by the respondent  to  refuse  her  protection  and
    human rights claim. The claim was certified.

10. Further submissions or representations were submitted on her behalf  on
    the 7 September 2016 raising a further protection human  rights  claim.
    Thereafter the respondent requested further information relating to her
    medical circumstances.

11. On 1 March 2018 the certification was withdrawn and a new decision  was
    made to refuse her protection and human rights claim.

Respondent's decision letter of 1 March 2018:

12. The Respondent made reference to the appellant's immigration history at
    paragraphs 1 - 15.  At paragraphs 26 - 28 the respondent summarised the
    factual basis of the claim based on her fear of  forced  marriage  upon
    return to Ghana but considered with reference to the country  materials
    that there would be a sufficiency of protection from the police in this
    context.  In  the  alternative  she  could  internally  relocate   (see
    paragraphs 42 - 46).

13. Consideration was given to her claim that she  would  be  considered  a
    witch as a result of her mental health condition at paragraphs 47 -  52
    but the conclusion reached was that she had provided no reason why  she
    could not internally relocate to a non-rural area  or  that  she  could
    seek assistance from a non-governmental organisation (paragraph 51).

14. The decision letter also considered her claim on Article 8 grounds  and
    in accordance with paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules at paragraphs
    67 - 74; noting that she did not claim to have a family life  with  any
    partner or children and in respect of a private life she had  not  been
    lawfully resident in the UK for most of her life having arrived in 2004
    and having spent her  youth  and  formative  years  in  Ghana.  It  was
    considered that there were no compelling circumstances in her  case  in
    the light of her criminal conviction and the  public  interest  in  her
    deportation.

15. At paragraphs 89 - 101 the respondent considered  her  claim  based  on
    Article 3-medical grounds but reached the conclusion  that  whilst  the
    quality of healthcare was not to the same standard as that in  the  UK,
    she had not shown that there were very compelling circumstances on  the
    facts of the case. Applying the test set out in N (FC)  v  SSHD  [2005]
    UKHL 31 at paragraph 97 and in the  light  of  the  medical  facilities
    available in Ghana at paragraph 99 it was concluded  that  her  removal
    did not reach the high threshold of severity to breach Article 3 on the
    basis of her medical condition.

16. The respondent therefore refused her protection and human rights  claim
    and it was not accepted that she felt with any  of  the  exceptions  to
    deportation section 33 of the UK Borders Act 2007.

17. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on 13 March 2018 and her  appeal
    came before the First-tier Tribunal on 11 September 2018.

18. The basis of her challenge to the respondent's decision to  deport  her
    from the United Kingdom was that section 33 of the UK Borders Act  2007
    applied founding on the Refugee and Human Rights Conventions.

19. The basis of the claim was that she feared forced marriage on return to
    Ghana and secondly, that she would face a real risk of serious harm  or
    treatment contrary to Article 3 on account of her mental health in  the
    light of the expert evidence (both country  materials  and  psychiatric
    evidence) and the likelihood of being subjected to  such  ill-treatment
    in an unregulated and unofficial prayer camp.



The FtT decision of the 7 November 2018:

20. In her findings of  fact,  the  FTtJ  rejected  her  account  that  the
    appellant would be at risk of forced marriage for the reasons  set  out
    at paragraphs 17 - 23. The judge also found that paragraph 399  (a)  or
    (b) did  not  apply  and  the  appellant  could  not  demonstrate  that
    paragraph 399A applied  and  that  there  were  no  other  "exceptional
    compelling considerations" that applied. None of those issues form  the
    subject of this appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

21. As  regards  the  alternative  basis  and  the  Article  3/humanitarian
    protection claim, the judge made the following findings of fact relying
    upon the unchallenged evidence in the form of  the  expert  report  and
    country materials and the psychiatric/medical reports:-

          1) The appellant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia which was a
             severe  and  enduring  mental  illness   alongside   psychotic
             symptoms and symptoms of a depressive illness (at [25-27]).

          2) The appellant required medication to treat her  condition  and
             reduce the risk of relapse (at [28]).

          3) The same level of psychiatric support was required to avoid  a
             relapse of a schizophrenic illness in the light of the  number
             of episodes she had had in the past and  the  medical  opinion
             was that long-term treatment with antipsychotic medication was
             necessary.  Furthermore,  medication  alone   would   not   be
             sufficient and she required that alongside a multidisciplinary
             and holistic treatment plan (at [30-31]).

          4) The absence of a treatment plan coupled  with  the  input  and
             support  from  a  multidisciplinary  team  may   lead   to   a
             deterioration in health and she would have a relapse (at  [31-
             32]).

          5) The report from a country expert  was  accepted  (relating  to
             health services and society in Ghana  for  those  with  mental
             illness). Psychiatric facilities in  Ghana  were  limited  and
             below standard; the report included  documented  incidents  of
             abuse against mentally ill patients. Psychiatric patients  are
             forced to live in prayer camps and psychiatric  hospitals  (at
             [33-34]).

          6) The appellant's current medication was not available in  Ghana
             (as set out in the  report  and  also  on  the  basis  of  the
             material relied upon by the respondent). As the appellant  was
             unlikely to have her medication  on  return,  the  alternative
             would be to change her medication but the transition would  be
             an additional  psychosocial  stress  increasing  the  risk  of
             relapse. The multidisciplinary treatment  plan  would  not  be
             available (at [35-37]).

          7) Those with mental illness are taken to a  traditional  doctor,
             healer priest or prayer  camp.  The  expert's  report  on  the
             conditions in prayer camps  made  reference  to  people  being
             chained,  shackled  and  beaten,  being  subjected  to  forced
             ingestion to induce vomiting, administered poison and made  to
             endure heat tests. Those with limited family  networks/support
             systems were likely to be  taken  to  prayer  camps  and  that
             despite the state ban on such practices, they continue  to  be
             used widely (at [38-41]).

          8) The respondent's country materials also made reference to  the
             deficiencies in mental health care  facilities  in  Ghana  and
             also identified that there were hundreds of unregistered,  and
             unregulated prayer camps which had  reportedly  used  torture,
             inhumane  and  degrading  treatment  including  shackling  and
             forced fasting (at [42-43].

          9) Other material referred to mental health conditions  perceived
             as having a spiritual basis so sufferers are  sent  to  prayer
             camps  and  other  faith-based  healing  centres  where   ill-
             treatment and  degrading  living  conditions  are  rife.  Such
             treatment is not certified or regulated (at [44]).

         10) The judge reached the conclusion that the likelihood that  the
             change in her current  treatment  regime  and  the  transition
             period, may cause a deterioration  in  her  mental  state  and
             result in relapse  and  may  be  considered  a  "psychological
             stressor."  On  return  the  appellant  may  begin  displaying
             psychotic behaviour and in the absence  of  family  and  close
             friends may be placed in prayer camp where ill-treatment could
             not be ruled out. Thus the combined effect that a change in or
             absence of  medication  along  with  how  society  treats  the
             mentally ill, will give rise to risk on return (at [46-47]).

         11) The appellant could not avail herself of State  protection  as
             the authorities share similar views (at [47]).

         12)  The  FtTJ   therefore   allowed   the   appeal   on   Article
             3/humanitarian protection grounds.

The grounds of challenge:

22. In grounds of appeal dated the 12 November 2018 the  respondent  sought
    permission to appeal the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

23. We set out those grounds in full:

         "1.  It is respectfully submitted that the FtTJ erred in law in the
             approach to Article 3 in allowing the appeal.

         2.   The appellant suffers  from  paranoid  schizophrenia  that  is
             currently described as moderate with a low risk of suicide. It
             is well established in the context  of  a  foreign  case,  the
             Article 3 threshold is particularly high simply because it  is
             a foreign case, and  it  is  even  higher  where  the  alleged
             inhuman treatment is not the direct or indirect responsibility
             of the public authorities of the receiving State, the  results
             from some naturally occurring  illness,  whether  physical  or
             mental. This is made clear in paragraphs  49  of  D  v  United
             Kingdom (1979) 24 EHRR 425 and paragraph 40 of  Bensaid  v  UK
             2001 33EHRR.

         3.   It is respect it is submitted that the  due  consideration  to
             the leading authorities in this field have not been  correctly
             considered and if they had the Tribunal was bound to  come  to
             the conclusion that the appellant's position did not meet  the
             high Article 3 threshold because any deterioration  would  not
             be serious,  rapid  and  irreversible,  resulting  in  intense
             suffering.

         4.   This is further reinforced by the authority of N [2005]  2  AC
             296 that at paragraph 94 makes reference to

                  "It must be shown that the applicant's  medical  condition
                  has  reached  such  a  critical  stage  that   there   are
                  compelling humanitarian grounds were not removing  him  or
                  her to a place which lacks the medical and social services
                  when he or she would need to prevent acute suffering while
                  he or she is dying."

         5.   The essential principle is that the ECHR does not  impose  any
             obligation on the contracting states to  providers  liable  to
             deportation with medical  treatment  lacking  in  their  "home
             countries". This principle applies even when  the  consequence
             would  be  that  the  deportees  life  will  be  significantly
             shortened, see N v UK [2008] 47 EHRR 885 paragraph 44

                       "advances in medical science,  together  with  social
                  and economic differences between  countries,  entail  that
                  the level of treatment available in the contracting  state
                  and the country of origin may vary considerably. While  it
                  is necessary, given the fundamental importance of  Article
                  3 in the convention system, the court to retain  a  degree
                  of flexibility to prevent expulsion  in  very  exceptional
                  cases, Article 3 does  not  place  an  obligation  on  the
                  contracting state to alleviate  such  disparities  through
                  the provision of free and unlimited  health  care  to  all
                  aliens without a right to stay  within  its  jurisdiction.
                  Finding to the contrary would place too great a burden  on
                  the contracting states."

         6.   As confirmed in the recent authority of MM Malawi [2018)  EWCA
             Civ 2482, the test identified in N is still  binding  on  this
             Tribunal and should be followed. There is no  suggestion  that
             treatment although  significantly  below  that  the  appellant
             currently receives is not available  in  Ghana.  The  test  to
             determine when Article 3 May prevent removal  of  the  foreign
             national in the UK  in  a  medical  case  was  authoritatively
             settled so far as domestic law is concerned in N  v  Secretary
             of State for the home Department [2005] UK HR 31  as  endorsed
             by the grand chamber of the European Court of human rights  in
             N v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 39.

         7.   The fact that a journalist considers that the psychiatric care
             facilities are limited and are of a low standard  is  no  more
             than background evidence and does not undermine  the  relevant
             test identified in N and Bensaid.

         8.   In a similar way the suggestion  that  the  police  will  view
             mental illness as  witchcraft  speculation  suggests  although
             suffering from mental  health  illnesses  in  Ghana  would  be
             needed protection. The appellant may  be  subject  to  stigma,
             discrimination and even harassment,  but  however  unpalatable
             they do not breach  the  threshold  envisaged  of  inhuman  or
             degrading treatment. Whilst the suggestion that the  appellant
             before slipping a prayer can begin without  more  is  no  more
             than speculation."

24. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge Woodcraft  in  the
    following terms:-

         "The appellant is a citizen of  Ghana.  She  appealed  against  the
         refusal of International protection (following a deportation order)
         arguing that she was at risk  upon  return  because  she  would  be
         forced to marry against her will. The judge rejected this claim but
         allowed the appeal  because,  he  held,  the  appellant  would  not
         receive adequate care for her mental health problems on return.

         The respondent's grounds of onward appeal  argued  that  the  judge
         misdirected  himself  in  relation  to  whether   the   appellant's
         condition brought within the parameters of Article  3.  This  issue
         has been recently clarified by the Court of  Appeal  in  MM  Malawi
         [2018] EWCA Civ 2482 and the determination arguably errs in law  is
         not following authorities such as N [2015] 2AC 296 and the  law  as
         explained in MM. All of grounds may be argued."

The appeal before the Upper Tribunal:

25. The appeal therefore came before us in order to determine whether there
    was an error of law in the decision of the FtTJ and if so,  whether  to
    set that decision aside and give further directions for its  re-making.
    The appellant was not present at the proceedings and we  were  informed
    that this was because she was currently the subject of treatment  under
    the Mental Health Act.

26. We heard submissions from both advocates. Mr Bramble  relied  upon  the
    written grounds seeking permission to appeal.  He  submitted  that  the
    evidence provided did not breach the threshold to constitute inhuman or
    degrading treatment. He drew our  attention  to  paragraph  46  of  the
    determination  where  the  judge  had  made  a  finding   as   to   the
    circumstances upon return to Ghana. He submitted that in that paragraph
    the judge had engaged in speculation and this was evidenced by the  use
    of the word "may"  where  he  stated  that  she  may  begin  displaying
    psychotic behaviour, and "may" be placed in a  prayer  camp.  Thus  the
    language used by the judge demonstrated that he  had  not  applied  the
    required high threshold for a breach of Article  3  which  would  imply
    that potentially all of those who suffer from mental  health  in  Ghana
    would be in need of protection.

27. In his submissions he accepted that the grounds did not  challenge  the
    findings of fact made by the FtTJ but there was an assumption  made  by
    the judge that the appellant would end up in a prayer camp, which  went
    further than was justified by the use of the  word  "may"  set  out  in
    paragraph 46.

28. Mr Bramble made reference to the  expert's  report  which  referred  at
    paragraph 16 to societal attitudes towards those  with  mental  illness
    and at paragraph 22 stated that "patients with limited family  networks
    and support systems are more likely to be taken to prayer camps, simply
    because they are less likely to have the means and peer support to  get
    the medical care  they  need."  By  reference  to  that  paragraph,  he
    submitted that the report did not state that  all  people  with  mental
    illness would be taken to such a  camp  and  it  would  depend  on  the
    individual circumstances of the appellant.

29. He did not seek to advance any submissions to counter the rule 24 reply
    served on behalf of the appellant  as  he  stated  that  there  was  no
    challenge in the grounds to the findings of  fact  made  by  the  judge
    which were not in dispute. Thus he submitted that the issue was whether
    applying those findings it was sufficient to reach the threshold for  a
    breach of Article 3.

30. Miss Solanki in her submissions on behalf of the appellant relied  upon
    her rule 24 reply dated 10 January 2019.

31. In that reply she stated that the grounds of appeal and  the  grant  of
    permission misunderstood the basis  upon  which  the  appeal  had  been
    allowed by the FtTJ. It had not  been  allowed  on  Article  3  medical
    grounds but had been allowed on humanitarian protection grounds, on the
    basis that the appellant would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or
    degrading treatment or punishment or "serious harm" (Article 15(b))  on
    return to Ghana.

32. In her oral submissions she stated that the starting point must be  the
    findings of fact which were unchallenged and that contrary to what  was
    asserted in the grounds, could not be described as speculative but were
    in  fact  well-reasoned  when  set  against  the  objective  background
    evidence provided by both the  appellant  and  the  respondent  and  by
    reference to the expert evidence before the FtTJ.

33. In respect of the objective background material, she submitted that the
    respondent's own evidence did not run contrary  to  that  submitted  on
    behalf of the appellant.  At  paragraph  43,  the  judge  recorded  the
    respondent's evidence (the UN HR committee concluding  observations  on
    initial  Ghana  report,  August  2016)  which  made  reference  to  the
    deficiencies in the mental health care facilities in  Ghana,  including
    overcrowding and limited staffing but also that  there  was  a  concern
    about the hundreds of unregistered, unregulated  "prayer  camps"  which
    deal with mental illness. The report referred to the "use  of  torture,
    inhumane and degrading treatment at these  camps,  including  shackling
    and forced fasting."

34. She submitted that in the light of the medical evidence, which had  not
    been the subject of challenge, she  had  been  described  as  having  a
    severe and enduring condition which  had  resulted  in  her  being  the
    subject of hospitalisation under the Mental Health Act on a  number  of
    occasions. The findings made by the judge were therefore  made  in  the
    light of the medical evidence the psychiatric report and the  objective
    material. She summarised those findings at paragraph 8 of the  rule  24
    reply.

35. Thus she submitted that the evidence demonstrated that there was a real
    risk that the appellant would find herself in one of those prayer camps
    and would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the  ECHR,
    namely being shackled, chained or beaten and  this  was  based  on  the
    respondent's own background material. The  ill-treatment  described  as
    occurring in the prayer camps therefore amounted to torture, inhuman or
    degrading treatment as set out in the definition of Article 3 or within
    "serious harm". She reminded the Tribunal  that  the  grounds  had  not
    engaged with the law in this area nor had any submissions been made  in
    this respect.

36. She reiterated that this was not a medical case which relied  upon  the
    lack of treatment in  the  receiving  country  but  one  in  which  the
    appellant had been found to be at real risk of relapse and whereby  she
    would display behaviour which would result in her  being  placed  in  a
    prayer camp where there was a reasonable degree of likelihood  or  real
    risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3.  The  judge
    had given a properly reasoned decision based upon the country evidence,
    the evidence of the psychiatrist and the range  of  objective  evidence
    from both parties and had reached a conclusion that was open to her.

37. Mr Bramble made no reply to the submissions made by Miss Solanki.

38.  At the conclusion of the hearing we reserved our decision which we now
    give.

The Law:

39. We have not been directed  to  any  case  law  by  Mr  Bramble  in  his
    submissions relevant to the burden and standard of proof necessary  for
    a breach of Article 3. We do not think that the legal  principles  that
    are applicable are in any way controversial and have been most recently
    been set out in the decisions of the Court  of  Appeal  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

40. Article 3 provides:

         "No one shall be subjected to torture or to  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment or punishment."

41. As regards Article 3 the Strasbourg court has consistently stated  that
    "to fall within the scope of Article 3 the ill-treatment must attain  a
    minimum level of severity".

42. An appellant in a human rights appeal  who  asserts  that  his  or  her
    removal from the United Kingdom would violate Article  3  of  the  ECHR
    must establish that claim. In other  words,  the  appellant  bears  the
    burden of proof.  The standard of proof requires the appellant to  show
    a "reasonable likelihood" or "real risk" of Article 3 harm.

43. The Immigration Appeal Tribunal so held in Kacaj (Article 3 -  Standard
    of Proof - Non-State Actors) Albania* [2001] UKIAT 00018 ("Kacaj").  At
    paragraph 12 of its determination, the IAT said that "the standard  may
    be a relatively low one, but it is for the applicant to  establish  his
    claim to that standard".

44. It is undisputed that Kacaj is "starred" for what it says in  paragraph
    12 of the determination.   There  is  no  domestic  case  law  that  is
    inconsistent with Kacaj  (and  see  Section  107(3)  and  (3A)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act")  provides
    that practice directions made under section 23 of the Tribunals, Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007 may require the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
    Upper Tribunal to treat a specified decision of, amongst other  bodies,
    the Immigration Appeal Tribunal,  as  authoritative  in  respect  of  a
    particular matter).

45. More recently in AM (Zimbabwe) and Another v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 64, Sales LJ held:-

         "16. It is common ground that where a  foreign  national  seeks  to
             rely upon Article 3 as an answer to an attempt by a  state  to
             remove him into another country, the overall legal  burden  is
             on him to show that Article 3 would be infringed in  his  case
             by showing that there are substantial  grounds  for  believing
             that he would face a real risk of being subject to torture  or
             to inhuman or degrading treatment in that other country ..."

46. In Paposhvili  v  Belgium  (Application  no.  41738/10),  given  on  13
    December 2016, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR examined the threshold in
    an Article 3 case, involving a claim by a person  that  to  remove  him
    from Belgium would lead to a real risk of serious harm as a result of a
    deterioration in his medical condition, where that condition could  not
    be said to be attributable to the authorities of the country  to  which
    he was proposed to be returned.

47. Paragraphs 186 and 187,  contain  what  can  be  seen  to  be  standard
    statements of the ECtHR regarding the burden of proof:-

         "186.    In  the  context  of  these  procedures,  it  is  for  the
             applicants to adduce evidence capable  of  demonstrating  that
             there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the
             measure complained of were to be implemented,  they  would  be
             exposed to  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
             contrary to Article 3 (see Saadi, cited above, � 129, and F.G.
             v. Sweden, cited above, � 120).  In this connection it  should
             be observed that a certain degree of speculation  is  inherent
             in the preventive purpose of Article 3 and that it  is  not  a
             matter of requiring the persons  concerned  to  provide  clear
             proof of their claim that they would be exposed to  proscribed
             treatment  (see,  in  particular,  Trabelsi  v.  Belgium,  no.
             140/10, � 130, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).

         187. Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the  authorities  of
             the returning State, in the context of domestic procedures, to
             dispel any doubts raised by it (see Saadi, cited above, � 129,
             and F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, �  120).   The  risk  alleged
             must be subjected to close scrutiny (see Saadi, cited above, �
             128; Sufi and Elmi v. the United  Kingdom,  nos.  8319/07  and
             11449/07, � 214, 28 June 2011; Hirsi Jamaa and  Others,  cited
             above, � 116; and Tarakhel, cited above, � 104) in the  course
             of which the authorities in the returning State must  consider
             the foreseeable consequences of  removal  for  the  individual
             concerned in the receiving State, in the light of the  general
             situation there and the  individual's  personal  circumstances
             (see Vilvarajah and Others,  cited  above,  �  108;  El-Masri,
             cited above, � 213; and Tarakhel, cited above,  �  105).   The
             assessment of the risk as defined above (see  paragraphs  183-
             84) must therefore take  into  consideration  general  sources
             such as  reports  of  the  World  Health  Organisation  or  of
             reputable  non-governmental  organisations  and  the   medical
             certificates concerning the person in question."

48. We have already set  out  in  paragraph  16  of  the  judgments  in  AM
    (Zimbabwe), whereby Sales LJ stated that the overall legal burden is on
    an applicant for international protection relying  upon  Article  3  to
    show that there are substantial grounds for believing that person would
    face a real risk of being  subjected  to  treatment  contrary  to  that
    Article, in the event of removal.  Sales LJ then said the following:-

         "In Paposhvili, at paras. [186] - [187] ... the  Grand  Chamber  of
         the ECtHR has given guidance how he may achieve that, by raising  a
         prima facie case of infringement of Article 3 which  then  cast  an
         evidential burden onto the defending  state  which  is  seeking  to
         expel him."

49. As regards Article 3 the Strasbourg court has consistently stated  that
    "to fall within the scope of Article 3 the ill-treatment must attain  a
    minimum level of severity" (we refer to  N v UK (2008) 47 EHRR 39 where
    the Strasbourg court observed at paragraph 31:

         "Article  3  principally  applies  to  prevent  a  deportation   or
         expulsion where the risk of ill-treatment in the receiving  country
         emanates  from  intentionally  inflicted   acts   of   the   public
         authorities there or from non-State bodies when the authorities are
         unable to afford the applicant appropriate protection..."

50. Article 3 imposes "absolute" rights, but in order to  fall  within  the
    scope of Article 3 the ill-treatment must attain  a  minimum  level  of
    severity. Whether the minimum level is attained in  a  particular  case
    depends on all the circumstances, such as the nature of the  treatment,
    its duration, and its physical and mental effects  and,  possibly,  the
    age, sex and health of the person concerned. In that sense, the test of
    whether there has been a breach of Article 3 in a  particular  case  is
    "relative".

51. "Degrading treatment" means treatment  "such  as  to  arouse  in  their
    victims  feelings  of  fear,  anguish  and   inferiority   capable   of
    humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical  and
    moral resistance" (Republic of Ireland v United Kingdom (1978) EHRR  25
    at [167]). For treatment to  amount  to  a  breach  of  Article  3,  it
    requires a "minimum level of severity"  (see,  e.g.,  Pretty  v  United
    Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1 at [52]).

Discussion:

52. The majority of the grounds, both written and oral, advanced on  behalf
    of the respondent relate to Article 3 in the context of lack of medical
    treatment in the home state (we refer  to  paragraphs  1  -  7  of  the
    written grounds). Those grounds cite the relevant  jurisprudence,  from
    the decisions in D v UK and N to the most recent decisions of the Court
    of Appeal in MM (Malawi) and the ECHR in Paposhvili.

53. There can be no dispute that if the FtTJ  had  reached  the  conclusion
    that the appellant's return to Ghana was contrary to Article 3 or  that
    she would be at a real risk of serious  harm  (Article  15(b))  on  the
    basis of the lack  of  medical  treatment/unavailability  in  the  home
    state, that would be contrary to the cited  authorities.  Miss  Solanki
    readily accepted that in her submissions made to this Tribunal.

54. In our judgement the grounds at paragraphs 1 - 7 misconstrue  and  fail
    to properly engage with the factual and  legal  basis  upon  which  the
    judge allowed  the  appeal  and  his  reasoning  by  reference  to  the
    evidence.

55. As to the medical circumstances of the appellant, they were set out  in
    a number of documents and  specifically  in  an  expert  psychiatrist's
    report (dated 4 September 2018) and were not the subject  of  challenge
    by the respondent.

56. The judge summarised the medical evidence at paragraphs 25 - 32.  There
    was no dispute that the appellant has a long-standing history of mental
    health problems which have included her treatment as an inpatient under
    the Mental Health Act where she remained for a period  of  five  months
    (see letter dated 14th of June 2018.  It is recorded that her  symptoms
    were characteristic of paranoid schizophrenia and that in addition  she
    had psychotic symptoms and symptoms of a  depressive  illness.  At  the
    time of the report it was confirmed that she was  accessing  medication
    to help address her psychosis and reduce the risk of relapse  and  that
    her mental health had improved due to a "robust treatment  plan"  which
    included regular monitoring, the help of the multidisciplinary team  of
    mental health professionals involved.

57.  In  his  opinion,  the  doctor  considered  that  the  same  level  of
    psychiatric support would be required on return to avoid a  relapse  of
    her schizophrenic illness which would make  day-to-day  life  difficult
    and result in social isolation. He made  reference  to  the  number  of
    episodes the appellant had historically and was  of  the  opinion  that
    long-term treatment with antipsychotic medication would  be  necessary.
    His opinion also was that medication would not be sufficient by  itself
    and that she also required a multidisciplinary and  holistic  treatment
    plan.

58. At paragraph 26 the judge accepted that the psychiatrist was an  expert
    for these proceedings and given the contents of the report,  which  had
    been consistent with  her  previous  mental  health  history,  attached
    weight to that report (see paragraph 32). The judge therefore  accepted
    the contents of that report  both  in  terms  of  the  description  and
    diagnosis of the condition and also as to the likely  effect  upon  her
    mental health in the absence of any treatment plan  and  medication  in
    Ghana which he concluded may lead to a deterioration in her health  and
    a relapse.

59. Similarly there was no challenge to the country expert report  dated  3
    September 2018, the author of which was also accepted as an  expert  in
    the light of her qualifications, experience  and  expertise  in  health
    services and society in Ghana (see paragraph 33).

60. The judge summarised the  important  aspects  of  that  report  in  the
    determination at paragraphs  34-41.  In  respect  of  psychiatric  care
    facilities in Ghana such facilities were limited and of a low  standard
    and included there were documented incidents of abuse against  mentally
    ill patients (see Human Rights Watch report).  Reference  was  made  to
    underfunding and that psychiatric patients are forced to live in prayer
    camps and psychiatric hospitals.

61. As regards medication, that which  the  appellant  had  been  currently
    taking was not widely available and upon her own research undertaken at
    the "best stocked" psychiatric hospital in Ghana it was confirmed  that
    they did not have access to it. In this context the judge also observed
    that the medication did not appear on the list that had  been  provided
    and relied upon by the respondent. The expert was of the view that  the
    appellant would be unlikely to have access to this medication on return
    and that any change in medication could be considered  as  one  of  the
    "additional psychosocial  stressors"  identified  by  the  psychiatrist
    which would increase the risk of a relapse in  her  mental  health.  In
    terms of the multidisciplinary, holistic treatment  plan  which  formed
    the basis of the appellant's treatment would not be available in Ghana.

62. The general circumstances in Ghana were described in the  report  which
    indicated that there were less than progressive attitudes  in  Ghanaian
    society towards those with mental illness which resulted  in  sufferers
    being chained and beaten because they were considered to be witches. In
    this context the expert made reference to the state authorities in 2017
    banning the use of chaining and shackling of such sufferers but despite
    which the practice continued to be widely used.  She  gave  an  example
    from her own experience of  witnessing  a  young  girl  suffering  from
    psychosis having been chained to a tree trunk by her family. The report
    made reference to those people who  display  signs  of  mental  illness
    being taken to a traditional doctor, healer, and priest or prayer  camp
    and at the prayer camps  chaining,  shackling  and  beating  occurring.
    Other forms of mistreatment  included  forced  ingestion  in  order  to
    induce vomiting,  administering  poison  and  enduring  heat  tests  to
    determine whether or not the person is  a  witch.  Those  with  limited
    family networks or a support system are more  likely  to  be  taken  to
    prayer camps.

63. It is plain from  reading  the  material  place  before  the  FtTJ  and
    recorded in the determination that the country materials relied  on  by
    the respective parties were  not  in  conflict  with  each  other.  The
    respondent provided evidence before the Tribunal concerning  how  those
    with mental illness are perceived in Ghana, the prevalence and  use  of
    unofficial and unregulated prayer camps and the resulting ill-treatment
    in such establishments. The judge recorded the respondent's own country
    evidence at paragraphs 42 - 44 which confirmed the appellant's evidence
    that in the camps there were reports of the use  of  torture,  inhumane
    and degrading treatment including that identified  by  the  appellant's
    country expert.

64. It is therefore against that evidential background and the unchallenged
    evidence that the judge made her final analysis. At paragraphs 45 -  47
    the judge stated as follows:-

         "45. On carefully considering the expert in background evidence, it
         seems that this is not a matter of the availability of health  care
         in Ghana on the appellants return, as the aim is not  to  guarantee
         she will receive the  same  level  of  health  care  she  currently
         receives in the UK, but rather the likelihood that  the  change  in
         her current treatment regime and the transition period, may cause a
         deterioration  in  her  mental  state  and  result  in  a  relapse,
         according to the doctor. This may  be  considered  a  psychological
         stressor.

         46.   The  appellant  on  return  may  begin  displaying  psychotic
         behaviour and in the absence of family or  close  friends,  may  be
         placed in a prayer camp where ill-treatment cannot  be  ruled  out.
         Thus the combined effect the changing or absence of medication will
         have, along with the way society treats the mentally  ill,  I  find
         will give rise to a risk on return.

         47.  I find the appellant cannot  avail  herself  of  the  help  or
         protection of the state authorities, as they share similar views. I
         find the appellant is established in Article 3 risk on return."

59.  In  our  judgement,  whilst  the  appellant  relied  upon  the  medical
    evidence relating to her mental  health,  it  was  not  simply  in  the
    context of lack of treatment upon return to Ghana but  was  founded  on
    the evidence which demonstrated that the change in her regime  of  care
    (including the removal of the multidisciplinary treatment plan, support
    from the UK, the lack of medication) demonstrated that there was a real
    risk of relapse in her condition  which  would  give  rise  to  further
    consequences. The judge was entitled to place weight and reliance  upon
    the unchallenged evidence that the effect of this  upon  the  appellant
    was that there was a real risk of her displaying behaviour  of  a  type
    identified in the expert evidence which would result  in  a  reasonable
    likelihood or real risk of her being  placed  in  a  prayer  camp.  The
    evidence  before  the  Tribunal  demonstrated  not  only  that  general
    psychiatric care facilities were limited but that there  were  hundreds
    of unofficial and unregulated prayer camps where those displaying signs
    of mental illness were likely to be taken to for "treatment".

60.  Similarly there was no dispute as to the level of severity of the  ill-
    treatment at such prayer camps which  involved  people  being  chained,
    shackled or beaten, made to  endure  forced  ingestion  and  undergoing
    treatment such as chaining and shackling which  continued  in  practice
    despite having been banned by the state authorities.

61.  In the light of the evidence before the FtTJ and the analysis  of  that
    evidence, we reach the conclusion that the decision was  one  that  was
    reasonably open to  the  judge  to  make  and  thus  it  has  not  been
    demonstrated that there is any error of law in her decision. The  judge
    identified  and  analysed  the  evidence  which  in  its  contents  was
    sufficient to demonstrate substantial grounds for believing that  there
    was a real risk that the appellant, in the light of  her  own  personal
    circumstances and characteristics, would find herself in an unregulated
    and unofficial prayer camp. It has not been argued before us  that  the
    treatment identified by the country materials relied on by both parties
    would  not  fall  within  the  definition  of  "inhuman  or   degrading
    treatment" contrary to Article 3 or "serious harm" (Article 15 (b)).

62.  We do not consider that the language used by the judge at paragraph  46
    indicates that he engaged in any form of speculation,  rather  that  it
    demonstrates that the judge had properly analysed the evidence of  risk
    in the light of the appellant's personal background, circumstances  and
    characteristics. We observe that  the  judge  did  refer  to  "risk  on
    return" as opposed to "real risk on return" but we consider  that  this
    does not undermine the decision  the  judge  reached.  Earlier  in  the
    determination, at paragraph 8 the judge set out a self-direction as  to
    the correct burden and standard of proof and made express reference  to
    "real risk on return" and we are satisfied that the judge had the self-
    direction in mind when reaching her overall analysis and conclusions.

63.  Nor do we accept the submission  made  by  Mr  Bramble  that  the  FtTJ
    failed to have regard to the fact that the report stated that  not  all
    people with mental illness  would  be  housed  in  such  a  camp.  That
    submission fails to take into account that the report also stated  that
    those who were more likely to be taken to prayer camps and  to  be  the
    subject of mistreatment were those with  limited  family  networks  and
    support. The judge in his findings had regard  to  the  evidence  as  a
    whole concerning her personal circumstances  and  her  health  and  the
    judge expressly found at [41] that she had no close family in Ghana  or
    any close  social  network  to  provide  her  with  any  assistance  in
    accessing protection. She therefore fell into the  category  identified
    by the expert.

63.  Furthermore given the judge's unchallenged finding at [47] it was  open
    the judge to find that the receiving state would not be able to provide
    sufficiency of protection for the appellant from  non-state  actors  to
    prevent the real risk of harm identified from occurring.

64.  For those reasons we have therefore reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    grounds advanced by the respondent do not identify any error of law  in
    the decision of the FtTJ.

Decision:

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error on a point of law and the appeal is dismissed;  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal shall stand.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her.  This direction applies both to the  Appellant  and
to the Respondent.  Failure to comply with  this  direction  could  lead  to
contempt of court proceedings.
