                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the linked appeals of the appellants against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Flower promulgated 20.2.15, who dismissed his
    appeal against the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  to  refuse
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the spouse and children of the
    sponsor settled in the UK, pursuant to Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 30.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.2.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 21.9.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein, I find there was no material  error  of
    law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to
    require the decision of Judge Flower to be set aside.  In  essence,  in
    respect of all but one of the grounds of appeal, they amount to  either
    misunderstanding of the decision or are no  more  than  a  disagreement
    with the findings of fact and an attempt to reargue the case, including
    with further evidence.

 5. Judge Flower found at �25 that the appellants had failed  to  discharge
    the burden on them to demonstrate that the child appellants are related
    to the sponsor as claimed. At �29 the judge found "so  little  evidence
    of a subsisting  marriage  that  I  find  the  sponsor  has  failed  to
    discharge the burden of proof." In fact, the burden is on the appellant
    and not the sponsor, but it comes to the same conclusion.

 6. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  in  effect  claim
    that the judge erred in finding that the marriage did not subsist, that
    the children were not related to the sponsor and that evidence provided
    by the landlord could not be taken into account.

 7. In granting permission to  appeal,  Judge  De  Haney  considered,  "The
    finding that the marriage does not subsist under the immigration rules,
    at paragraph 29, is not easily reconciled  with  the  judge's  findings
    that family life can continue, "in the same way as he has chosen to  do
    for the past decade or more," paragraph 31." With respect to  Judge  De
    Haney, I disagree. The suggestion that family life can  continue  means
    no more than it can continue to the very limited extent that  there  is
    any family life between then given  the  occasional  visits  (only  two
    since 2010), no earlier application,  and  only  limited  telephone  or
    Internet or other communication. The judge rejected the sponsor's claim
    that documents he had submitted had been lost by the respondent.

 8. Mr Hussain submitted that there was a discrepancy between  the  finding
    at �19 that the sponsor is validly married to the first  appellant  and
    the subsequent finding that the marriage is not subsisting.  I  do  not
    accept that there is any inconsistency in  the  decision.  There  is  a
    clear difference between a lawful marriage validly entered into and one
    that is no longer subsisting. The judge gave cogent reasons open to her
    on the evidence for finding the evidence as to the subsistence  of  the
    marriage insufficient to discharge the burden of proof. There was  very
    limited evidence of contact between them. Whilst the judge accepted the
    sponsor had visited India on some 7 occasions since 2004,  at  �28  she
    found no credible evidence of money remittance, which was in any  event
    less than �100  a  year,  and  noted  that  the  sponsor  had  no  real
    explanation for why no application for entry clearance  had  been  made
    previously.

 9. Mr Hussain relied on Goudey (subsisting marriage -evidence) [2012] UKUT
    41, where the Upper Tribunal held that subsisting marriage  means  that
    the matrimonial relationship must continue at the relevant time  rather
    than just the formality of a marriage, but  it  does  not  require  the
    production of particular  evidence  of  mutual  devotion  before  entry
    clearance can be granted. It also held that evidence of telephone cards
    is  capable  of  being  corroborative  of   a   claim   to   telephonic
    communication. "Where there are no  countervailing  factors  generating
    suspicion as to the intentions of the parties,  such  evidence  may  be
    sufficient to discharge the burden of proof on the claimant."

10. I find no inconsistency between Goudey and the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. Clearly, Mr Hussain does not understand  the  difference
    between the formality, or validity, of a marriage and  the  subsistence
    of the matrimonial relationship. Save for the issue  of  accommodation,
    all of the evidence to which  Mr  Hussain  directed  my  attention  was
    specifically  taken  into  account  in  the  decision.   Mr   Hussain's
    submissions were in the main essentially to the effect that  the  judge
    should have made a different decision on the evidence. He said that the
    decision goes against the weight of the evidence.

11. Whilst a different judge may have reached a different  conclusion,  the
    appellants have to demonstrate that the decision contained  such  error
    of law that it should be set aside. They have to show that the decision
    was perverse, irrational, unsupported by  the  evidence,  or  that  the
    judge failed to take into account some  material  evidence  that  would
    have resulted in a different outcome to the appeal.  I  find  that  the
    judge has taken all relevant evidence into account. Every matter raised
    by Mr Hussain is referenced and taken into account by  the  judge.  The
    conclusions of the judge were ones open to her on the evidence and  for
    which cogent reasoning has been given.

12. In respect of the issue as to whether the children are related  to  the
    sponsor as claimed, Mr Hussain sought to  introduce  recently  obtained
    DNA evidence. However, that evidence was not before  the  Tribunal  and
    could not have been taken into account by  the  judge.  The  fact  that
    there may now be conclusive evidence of the relationship  does  not  in
    itself demonstrate an error of law in the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. That there are children, that there are photographs of  them,
    and non-contemporaneous birth certificates is certainly  relevant,  but
    it remains open on the very limited overall evidence before  the  judge
    to conclude that the appellants have not discharged the burden of proof
    to show that they are related as claimed. It is for the  appellants  to
    discharge that burden and in doing so  to  demonstrate  that  documents
    submitted are reliable. I am satisfied that all of these  matters  were
    properly considered and taken into account by the judge, in the  round,
    taken as a whole. No error of law is disclosed.

13. At �30 the judge  was  not  satisfied  that  there  would  be  adequate
    accommodation for the appellants and the sponsor in the UK. Whilst  the
    judge accepted that the accommodation in which the appellant is  living
    would be large enough, a concern was raised by  the  respondent  as  to
    whether the landlord would consent to three further people residing  at
    the address. As a result of this issue  being  raised  in  the  refusal
    decision,  the  appellants  produced  a  letter  of  consent  from  the
    landlord. However, Judge Flower concluded that as this letter postdated
    the decision by several months it could  not  be  taken  into  account.
    Whilst the judge was correct to note that as an out of  country  appeal
    the Tribunal is limited to considering the circumstances prevailing  at
    the date of decision, post-decision evidence  which  relates  to  those
    circumstances  remains  admissible.  I  also  note  that  the   tenancy
    agreement submitted with the application permits  up  to  three  adults
    living at the property. Mr Hussain submitted that in the light of  that
    provision consent from the landlord for the three  appellants  was  not
    necessary.

14. Whilst I find that there  is  an  error  of  law  in  relation  to  the
    accommodation issue, it is not material as the other grounds of  appeal
    have failed and thus the appeals  would  have  been  dismissed  in  any
    event.

Conclusions:

15. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such as to required the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of  each  appellant  remains  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  make
no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of each appellant has been dismissed and thus there  can
be no fee award.
