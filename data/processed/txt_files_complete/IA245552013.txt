                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms K Joshi, Legal Representative, Good Advice UK
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines  born  on  13th  November
    1981.  She seeks leave to remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse of
    her sponsor husband.

2.   That application was  refused  under  paragraph  276ADE  and  under  E-
    LTRP.3.1.  In particular it was said that the sponsor did not have  the
    requisite amount of income to meet the Rules.

3.   The Secretary of State in the reasons dated 28th May 2013  set  out  in
    greater detail why the application for further leave had been  refused.



4.   Since the date of decision funds from Kashmir have been transferred  to
    the sponsor's account NatWest bank statement showing savings of �43,447
    was enclosed in the letter  dated  20th  May  2013.   In  addition  the
    sponsor husband has an annual income of �11,402.54.   There  is  little
    doubt, therefore, that  at  the  time  of  the  hearing  the  financial
    requirements were met although the Rules themselves provided  that  the
    financial requirement was to have the specified  amount  of  money  not
    less than six months prior to the date of the application.  How far  it
    assisted the appellant therefore in having the funds  at  the  date  of
    hearing was less clear.  The Judge therefore dismissed the appeal under
    the Immigration Rules and also in relation to Article 8 of the ECHR.

5.   Grounds of appeal were submitted against the decision  contending  that
    the findings that the appellant did not meet the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules was in error.  In the alternative that the Judge  had
    failed to engage with Article 8 and proportionality.

6.   Initially leave to appeal was refused but  was  granted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.     Thus the matter comes before  me  in  pursuance  of  that
    grant.

7.   A matter of concern in relation to the hearing was that the Judge  made
    frequent references to Rule 281 which specifies the requirements to  be
    met by a person seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom with  a  view
    to settlement.

8.   It  is  common  ground  that  such  a  Rule  is  inappropriate  in  the
    circumstances of the appellant and sponsor.  This  is  not  an  out  of
    country case rather it is  an  application  in  country  for  leave  to
    remain.  There seems  to  be  a  thread  of  reasoning  throughout  the
    determination concerning out of country applications.  For  example  in
    paragraph 25 there is a detailed consideration of the case of  MM  with
    reference once again to Rule 281(v).  Reference is made in paragraph 26
    also to the fact  that  certain  requirements  of  paragraph  281  were
    satisfied.

9.   As Mr Deller, who represents  the  respondent,  most  fairly  indicated
    this was not an entry clearance case  and  the  repeated  reference  to
    paragraph 281 served more to obscure the reasoning of the determination
    than otherwise might be the case.

10.   He  submitted  that  Appendix  FM-E  in  paragraph   11   particularly
    established the requirement of the requisite  funding  for  six  months
    prior to the application were the appellant to fail to meet  the  Rules
    then  it  would  be  only  in   the   most   compassionate   compelling
    circumstances that Article 8 would have any effect.   I  was  asked  to
    consider particularly the case of Gulshan in that regard.

11.  Ms Joshi, who represents the appellant, sought to persuade me that  the
    appellant did meet the Immigration  Rules  having  the  access  to  the
    relevant funds at the time of hearing but in any event there  had  been
    no proper consideration of Article 8 in the light  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  It seems to me that  the  interests  of  justice  and  fairness
    should be paramount in the circumstances of this case.  It may well  be
    that  under  the  strict  application  of  the  Immigration  Rules  the
    appellant does not meet those Rules, having regard to the  requirements
    of such Rules.  However,  the  precise  reasoning  in  respect  of  the
    relevant Immigration Rules has been obscured by repeated  reference  to
    one that has in fact no application.

12.  No attempt has been made to apply the current jurisprudence to  Article
    8 or to make findings of fact as to whether or not there is an arguable
    case for such rights to be considered outside the Immigration Rules.

13.  I determine, and indeed Mr Deller most fairly conceded, that given  the
    lack of clarity in certain of the reasoning that it would be unfair not
    to set aside the determination on an error of  law  and  to  grant  the
    appellant the opportunity of having the arguments clearly presented and
    findings of fact made upon them.

14.  In those circumstances the decision of  Judge  Plumptre  shall  be  set
    aside to be re-made.  No findings are to be preserved.

15.  I have regard  to  paragraph  7  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Direction.  It is to be recognised that there will be  evidence  to  be
    considered in some detail and findings of fact to be  made.   In  those
    circumstances I find that it is appropriate to remit the matter back to
    the First-tier Tribunal for hearing.  A date for that to take place has
    been set as 26th November 2014.

16.  Any further evidence concerning  funding  or  as  to  the  private  and
    family life of the appellant and sponsor should be submitted  no  later
    than fourteen days prior to that hearing.





Signed                                  Date 30/06/2014
