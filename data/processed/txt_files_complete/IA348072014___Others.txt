Representation:
For the appellants:    Mr SA Ganter, instructed by Farani Javid Taylor
Solicitors LLP
For the respondent:    Ms E Sage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Farrukh Jamil, date of birth 3.3.74, his wife,  Munazza
    Farrukh, date of birth 4.2.76, and their daughter, Alnina Farrukh, date
    of birth 18.2.07, now aged 8, are citizens of Pakistan.

 2. These are their linked  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge O'Hagan promulgated 14.1.15,  dismissing  their  appeals
    against the decisions of the respondent, dated 16.8.14, to refuse their
    applications for further leave to remain in the UK, and to remove  them
    by way of directions pursuant to section  10  of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 1999. The Judge heard the appeal on 29.12.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    3.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. The first
    appellant entered the UK on 11.3.02 with entry clearance as a  student,
    subsequently extended  to  31.8.08.  Meanwhile,  the  second  appellant
    entered the UK as a family visitor  on  14.12.03,  thereafter  she  was
    granted  further  leave  to  remain  as  the  dependant  of  the  first
    appellant. The third appellant was born in the UK in 2007 and  she  was
    also granted leave to remain as the dependant of the first appellant.

 6. On 24.9.08 the first appellant was granted leave to remain as a Tier  1
    Highly Skilled Post-study Migrant until 24.9.10, with  the  second  and
    third appellants as his dependants. On 23.9.10 the  appellants  applied
    for further leave to remain, but the applications were refused  with  a
    limited right of appeal. The appellants became appeal rights  exhausted
    (ARE) on 7.6.11 and from that point have had no lawful right to  remain
    in the UK. On 25.9.12, 15 months after they became ARE, the  appellants
    applied for leave to remain on the basis of human  rights  outside  the
    Immigration Rules. The applications were refused on 26.6.13, both under
    the Immigration Rules including Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE,  and
    no exceptional circumstances  were  found  to  justify  granting  leave
    outside the Rules on the basis of article 8  ECHR  private  and  family
    life rights. The decision also considered the  best  interests  of  the
    third appellant child under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009. These refusals are the  subject  of  the  present
    appeal.

Error of Law

 7. For the reasons set out below I find no material error of  law  in  the
    making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  requiring  the
    decision of Judge O'Hagan should be set aside.

 8. Judge O'Hagan considered the appeal both under the  Immigration  Rules,
    both EX1 of Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE,  and  then  outside  the
    Rules under article 8 ECHR. The judge did not agree with the submission
    that the child's position should  be  considered  first  before  or  in
    isolation of that of the parents. However, the judge accepted that  the
    best  interests  of  the  third  appellant   child   were   a   primary
    consideration, but not the  paramount  consideration  to  override  all
    other considerations.

 9. The grounds of application for permission to appeal  suggest  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge made a number of misdirections in law.

10. It is first suggested that the judge was in error when considering  the
    third appellant child by applying the wrong test  under  paragraph  276
    ADE(1)(iv). The child had by then lived in the  UK  for  7  years.  The
    issue was whether it was reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
    UK. That issue could not sensibly be considered without considering the
    situation in relation to the parents.  The  grounds  suggest  that  the
    judge wrongly applied  a  proportionality  test  rather  than  that  of
    reasonableness. Mr Ganter drew my attention to �37 of the decision  and
    the judge's references to the well-known caselaw on the best  interests
    of children. He suggested that whilst those cases may be relevant to an
    article 8 proportionality assessment, they were  not  relevant  to  the
    issue of reasonableness. He suggested that the language  of  the  judge
    suggests that he was making a proportionality assessment.

11. I do not accept this submission. Reading �36 through to  �40  together,
    it is clear that the judge did consider the reasonableness of expecting
    the child to leave the UK with her parents, even though she  had  lived
    here for 7 years. The judge's conclusion that the best interests of the
    child were to remain with her parents is unimpeachable and having found
    elsewhere in the decision that there was no basis to allow the  parents
    to remain, it followed that the best interests of  the  child  were  to
    accompany her parents to Pakistan. The judge relied on the  caselaw  to
    draw two particular principles, that the main focus of the child's life
    thus far would have been her life with her parents, and that whilst the
    child would not have the benefit of being educated further in  the  UK,
    the child has no right to be educated in the UK. The  judge  stated  at
    �37 that, "I considered that it would be reasonable to expect the third
    appellant to leave the UK as part of her family," and thus it is  clear
    that he was considering whether it was reasonable or not. Whilst  those
    case authorities are relevant to the proportionality balancing exercise
    there was no material  error  in  drawing  out  those  principles  when
    assessing the reasonableness of expecting the child  to  leave  the  UK
    with her parents. As Ms Sage submitted, the Rules, including  paragraph
    276ADE, were designed to incorporate the article  8  ECHR  private  and
    family life rights of applicants, so that the decision of the Secretary
    of State would be article 8 compliant. It was not wrong of the judge to
    consider the factors he did. I thus  find  no  error  of  law  on  this
    ground.

12. The second ground pursued by Mr Ganter was that at �50 the judge failed
    to make a real individual assessment of the child's best interests  and
    the generalised assessment of the First-tier Tribunal was  insufficient
    to  afford  the  proper  attention  to  her  circumstances.  Mr  Ganter
    complained that there was no specific consideration of the child's best
    interests. However, I find  that  throughout  the  decision  the  judge
    properly considered the best interests of the child. For example at �33
    of the decision, the judge referred to ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC
    4, and stated that he  wished  to  emphasise  that  he  considered  the
    child's welfare to be a significant factor and one of importance to his
    considerations. At �36 the  judge  set  out  relevant  factors  of  the
    child's life in the UK, that she has lived  here  all  her  life;  that
    although she has visited Pakistan twice, this is the only  country  she
    has  known;  and  the  Judge  accepted  that  she  would  have   formed
    friendships and achieved the degree of integration into school and  the
    wider community that one would expect of a child her age.  At  �38  the
    judge accepted that removal might be detrimental to her education.  The
    judge cited the relevant case law and the principles  drawn  therefrom.
    In particular, the extract from Zoumbas at �39 was highly relevant  and
    very similar to the facts of this case.

13. It is not necessary for the judge to set out every  piece  of  evidence
    relied on, provided that it is clear that  all  relevant  matters  have
    been considered and irrelevant matters excluded. In the  circumstances,
    I find no error of law in this ground of appeal.

14. The third ground and submission of Mr Ganter was that at  �50(iii)  the
    judge set out partial and selective findings  in  relation  to  section
    117B of the 2002 Act that  were  unfavourable  to  the  appellants  but
    ignored those which assisted them. Whilst  in  considering  the  public
    interest question, which is defined as meaning the question of  whether
    an interference with a person's right to respect for private and family
    life is justified under article 8(2) ECHR, the  judge  is  required  by
    section 117A in all  cases  to  have  regard  to  the  public  interest
    considerations listed in section  117B.  Mr  Ganter's  submissions  are
    misconceived. The requirement to have regard  to  the  public  interest
    considerations does not mean that he has to specifically  address  each
    one in turn, setting out those that are  not  relevant  to  the  public
    interest on the facts of the case. Neither do I accept  the  contention
    that somehow an appellant is entitled to have those  factors  that  are
    not relevant to  the  public  interest  converted  into  some  sort  of
    positive finding to be weighed in public interest scales. These are all
    public interest considerations; in other  words  consideration  of  the
    strength of the public interest in removal of the appellants.  That  an
    appellant may be able to speak English, or is financially  independent,
    is not a positive public interest factor that strengthens the claim  to
    remain in the UK, though those may be independently relevant factors to
    any proportionality assessment.

15. Finally, that the appellants or  any  of  them  speak  English  or  are
    financially independent could not reasonably have result in this appeal
    being allowed for those reasons or with those reasons included as  part
    of the proportionality assessment. I note that there appears to  be  no
    evidence of financial independence in the papers before me. The  family
    life of  these  appellants  was  formed  or  developed  in  the  UK  in
    circumstances of precariousness of the kind referred to in R (Nagre)  v
    SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin). They were illegal  overstayers  from  the
    expiry of their leave in 2010. Even prior to that  the  status  of  the
    adult appellants in the UK was entirely temporary and thus  precarious.
    They had no right to  remain  except  in  compliance  with  Immigration
    Rules, which they cannot meet. It is only  if  their  case  is  somehow
    exceptional that they would have been able to establish a violation  of
    article 8. None of their circumstances could be regarded as exceptional
    for the purpose of article 8, and in my view there was no necessity for
    the First-tier Tribunal to go beyond  the  Immigration  Rules,  as  the
    appellants  failed  to  demonstrate  any  compelling   or   exceptional
    circumstances not adequately recognised by the Rules so as to  justify,
    exceptionally, granting leave to remain  pursuant  to  article  8  ECHR
    outside  the  Rules  on  the  basis  that  the  decision   was   either
    unjustifiably  harsh  or  otherwise  disproportionate.   I   refer   in
    particular to the recent discussion of these principles by the Court of
    Appeal in the case of Agyarko & others v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 440.   It
    follows that even if I am wrong and  even  if  the  judge  should  have
    addressed each of the public interest considerations in turn and listed
    factors in the appellants favour, there is in fact no material error of
    law on the facts of this case, as such error of law would and could not
    have produced any different outcome to the appeal.

16. The one exception to that set out above,  is  in  relation  to  117B(6)
    where the provision specifies that it is not in the public interest  in
    the  particular  case  set  out  in  that  subsection,  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship  with  a  qualifying  child,  which  the  third
    appellant is, where it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to
    leave the UK. In that regard, whilst the  judge  did  not  specifically
    address 117B(6), it is clear that it is the same test of reasonableness
    as already considered under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv), and thus there can
    be no material error of law in neglecting to address it.

17. In the circumstances, I find no error of law in  this  or  any  of  the
    other grounds of application for permission to appeal.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of  each  appellant  remains  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
