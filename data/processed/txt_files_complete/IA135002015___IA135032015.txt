               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Bellara of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Singh, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants  are  citizens  of  India.   The  first  appellant  (the
    appellant) was born on 18 November 1988.  The second appellant  is  the
    appellant's child, born on 23 December 2010.

 2. The appellant appealed against the respondent's refusal dated 25  March
    2015.  The appeal was allowed by Judge Fowell (the judge) in a decision
    promulgated on 11 April 2016.

 3. The respondent sought permission to appeal  the  judge's  decision  and
    submitted that she carried out an inadequate analysis in  reaching  her
    decision and failed to properly  take  into  account  EV  (Philippines)
    [2014] EWCA Civ 874.

 4. Judge Frankish granted permission to appeal on  13  October  2006.   He
    found it was arguable that the  judge  had  carried  out  an  erroneous
    assessment of the best interests of the child.  Given  that  the  judge
    found that the appellant had lied regarding the level  of  support  she
    would have in India, there was arguably inadequate analysis as  to  why
    the child's developmental issues necessitated his remaining  here.   It
    was also arguable that insufficient weight had been given by the  judge
    to EV in respect of the UK not  being  responsible  for  educating  the
    world.

Submission on Error of Law

 5. Mr Singh relied upon the grounds.  Mr Bellara accepted that EV  was  of
    significance and the judge had failed  to  carry  out  the  appropriate
    analysis.

Conclusion on Error of Law

 6. The judge quoted the correct case  law  but  failed  to  carry  out  an
    analysis or any adequate analysis of the appellant's  circumstances  in
    regard to the case law.

 7. The judge's findings regarding the appellant's lack of  credibility  in
    terms of family support and her inability to  satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules  including  the  finding  that  there  would  not  be  any  "very
    significant obstacles" to her return to India  in  terms  of  paragraph
    276ADE do stand.

 8. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier for a judge other  than  Judge
    Fowell to establish whether there is a gap between the  Rules  and  the
    appellant's circumstances in terms of SS (Congo) [2005]  EWCA  Civ  387
    and Sunassee [2015] EWHC 1604 to require an Article 8 assessment of the
    circumstances outside the Rules and to make a decision in  that  regard
    taking into account inter alia EV.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and shall  be
reheard in the First-tier limited to the  issues  I  have  set  out  at  [8]
above.

No anonymity direction is made.
