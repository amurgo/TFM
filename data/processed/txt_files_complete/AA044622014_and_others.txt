For the Respondent: Mr Diwncyz, HOPO

DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. This appeal came before Judge Hindson on 31 July  2014.  He  dismissed
      the appellant's appeal on asylum grounds.


   2. In doing so he did not make any  reference  to  the  evidence  of  the
      second appellant, which was crucial to his decision since the claim is
      based at least in part on a fear of her brother, said to be  a  senior
      member of the local Taliban who had kidnapped her.

   3. Neither did he make reference to one of the grounds upon which it  was
      said that the family were at risk on return,  namely  that  the  first
      appellant had worked for a western organisation, a German charity.


   4. Mr Diwncyz accepted that the determination could not  stand  and  that
      the proper course was a remittal to the First-tier Tribunal.


   5. The decision of Judge Hindson is set aside on the basis  that  he  did
      not have regard to all  of  the  relevant  evidence  in  reaching  his
      decision, and did not determine one of the grounds  of  appeal  before
      him.


   6. The appellant was not represented before the FTT,  and  there  are  no
      witness statements. The case should therefore be set down  for  a  CMR
      before a judge  other  than  Judge  Hindson  so  that  proper  listing
      directions can be made. It should then be listed for a de novo hearing
      to be reheard afresh by a differently constituted first-tier tribunal,
      not to include Judge Hindson, at Bradford, with all issues at large.
