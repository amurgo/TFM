                                                                   Appellant


                                     and


                 SECREATARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant appealed against the decision made on 7 May 2015 to refuse
    him leave to remain. His appeal against that  decision  was  refused  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge McGavin in a decision promulgated on  4  March
    2016. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against  that  decision
    was granted on limited grounds on 17 March 2017.

 2. On 12 May 2017, the respondent wrote to the  Upper  Tribunal  requesting
    permission to withdraw her  case  as  she  intended  to  reconsider  the
    appellant's application in the light of the  fact  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had found that the appellant is in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with his wife and that they have a child who is  a  British
    Citizen.

 3. The respondent has also withdrawn her decision of 7 May 2015.

 4. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing that the respondent was the successful  party  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

 5. Accordingly, with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the respondent's  case
    is withdrawn.

 6. The effect of the respondents'  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.




Signed                              Date:  17 May 2017
