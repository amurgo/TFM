                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr E Raw, instructed by AKL Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Khalida Zahoor, date of birth 7.7.53, is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Broe promulgated  16.7.14,  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse her application  for  a  residence
    card as confirmation of a  right  to  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.   The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 23.6.14.

 3. On 7.8.14, First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes found the  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was out of time, declined to
    extend time and further indicated that the grounds did not  identify  a
    ground of appeal that would lead  to  the  decision  being  set  aside.
    However, when renewed to the Upper Tribunal, on 13.11.14 Upper Tribunal
    Judge Allen found it arguable that the judge erred in law in respect of
    grounds 2 and 3, but stated that the materiality of ground one remained
    to be made out. Judge Holmes had directed that any renewed  application
    to the Upper Tribunal should  be  supported  by  evidence  as  to  what
    occurred during the period 16 July to 29 July 2014.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. Unfortunately,  Judge  Allen  did  not  address  the  question  of  the
    application being out of time. The Rule 24 response raised the issue as
    to whether there is any valid appeal.

 6. I dealt with the validity of appeal as a preliminary issue.

 7. The decision of Judge Broe was promulgated on 16.7.14. Notice enclosing
    a copy of the decision was dispatched by the Tribunal on  16.7.14.  The
    appellant has produced a letter of that date but  stamped  22.7.14,  by
    the solicitors being the  date  they  claim  they  received  notice  of
    decision. I had some  concerns  as  to  this,  particularly  since  the
    solicitor's version of the letter they claimed to  have  been  received
    did not match the layout of the copy letter on the case  file.  Despite
    the directions of Judge Holmes, the appellant produced  no  witness  to
    confirm the letter had been received on 22.7.14, but merely set  out  a
    series of assertions in the grounds for permission  to  appeal.  It  is
    asserted that the appellant did not receive a copy of the  decision  at
    her home address, whereas the court file indicates that it was sent out
    at the same date to both the appellant at her home address and  to  her
    solicitors.

 8. Notwithstanding my concerns set out above, I have to assume that  Judge
    Allen intended to grant an extension of time and thus I do so, enabling
    the appeal to proceed.

Error of Law

 9. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Broe should be set aside.

10. For the reasons set out herein, after considering the evidence and  the
    submissions of the representatives, I find no  material  error  of  law
    requiring the decision to be set aside and remade.

11. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  briefly  summarised  as
    follows. The appellant came to the UK in  December  2011  as  a  family
    visitor. On 22.6.12 she made an application for an EEA  residence  card
    as the family member of her son Nadeem Sheikh,  which  was  refused  on
    16.11.12.

12. A further application for an EEA residence card  was  made  on  2.9.13,
    refused on 25.2.14, which refusal is the subject matter of this appeal.
    This was a 'Surinder Singh' type application. It was claimed  that  her
    son had exercised Treaty rights as a worker in another EEA  state,  but
    she had not resided with him. At all material times,  she  remained  in
    the UK. It was claimed that he had worked in  France  between  25.11.11
    and 4.5.12, returning to the UK 6 days later, taking up employment with
    a courier company on 21.5.12.

13. The refusal  decision  noted  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    satisfied the appellant and her son were residing  together  in  France
    before returning to the UK, and  thus   the  application  was  refused.
    Article 8 was also considered.

14. The refusal decision relied on regulation 9(2)(b) on the basis that the
    British citizen son failed to provide evidence that he was a  qualified
    person by working in an EEA state before returning to the UK  and  that
    his mother was living with him in that EEA state. At the appeal hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal it was contended that she did  not  have
    to show that she lived with him in France.  She  claims  to  have  been
    supported by him for some 20 years whilst she was in Pakistan and lived
    with him since she arrived in the UK. It was  pointed  out  that  under
    regulation 9(2)(b) the only relative required to have lived abroad with
    the British citizen is a spouse or civil partner. A direct relative  of
    the ascending line only had to prove dependency and thus, it is argued,
    under the provisions of regulation 7(i)(c) the appellant qualifies as a
    family member.

15. Judge Broe accepted Mr Raw's submissions that  the  appellant  did  not
    have to show that she resided with  her  son  in  France,  as  that  is
    clearly not the requirement under regulation 9(2). However,  the  judge
    relied on regulation 9(2)(c) and 9(3) of the  regulations  as  amended,
    and was not satisfied that the centre of the son's life had transferred
    to the EEA state where he worked for a number of months.

16. The judge relied on the fact that some of the documents adduced had not
    been translated from French, but  more  particularly  on  a  pro  forma
    statement with standard paragraphs and gaps to be filled in. At �22 the
    judge concluded that this extraordinary document was designed for  such
    applications in order to try to fit the EEA  regulations.  At  �23  the
    judge gave cogent reasons for finding that the son's life  had  not  in
    fact transferred to France, but that his time there was no more than  a
    manoeuvre designed to facilitate the appellant's application.

17. Mr Raw's argument, set out in the grounds of application for permission
    to appeal, is that the judge applied  the  wrong  set  of  regulations.
    Whilst the EEA  regulations  were  amended  by  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    (Amendment) (No2) Regulations 2013, which came into  force  on  1.1.14,
    there were transitional provisions set out in  Schedule  3,  preserving
    the pre-amendment  regulations  in  certain  conditions,  including  in
    paragraph 2 in relation to family members  of  British  citizens.  This
    provides the amendment has no effect in relation to the  family  member
    of  a  British  citizen  where  subparagraphs  (2)  or  (3)  are   met.
    Subparagraph (2)  relates  to  a  person  with  a  permanent  right  of
    residence in the UK under the 2006 Regulations; this does not apply  to
    the appellant. Subparagraph (3) requires the appellant, at the date  of
    coming into force of the amended regulations, to have a right to reside
    under the 2006 Regulations and (3)(c), had made  an  application  under
    the 2006 Regulations for a registration certificate or  residence  card
    which had been  refused  and  in  respect  of  which  an  appeal  under
    regulation 26 of the  2006  Regulations  could  be  brought  while  the
    appellant is in the UK.

18. It is submitted that the appellant had a right to reside under the 2006
    Regulations and had made an application on 2.9.13 for a residence card,
    which had been refused on 25.2.14, and in respect of  which  an  appeal
    could be brought and was brought against that refusal.

19. It follows that Judge Broe has applied the wrong version of  regulation
    9. The pre-amendment version should have been applied, under  which  it
    was necessary only to show that the appellant is a family member  of  a
    British citizen who was residing in  another  EEA  state  as  a  worker
    before returning to the UK. The transfer of the son's  centre  of  life
    was not a relevant issue on the facts of this case. What  was  relevant
    was the question of  dependency  and  whether  the  son  was  genuinely
    working whilst in France.

20. In respect of the latter issue, the judge found in effect that any time
    spent by the son in France was merely a device to try and  satisfy  the
    requirements of the EEA regulations. The appellant came to  the  UK  to
    reside with her son. In order to meet the EEA regulations  he  went  to
    France in November 2011, returning in May 2012. During that  period  of
    time the appellant remained in the UK, living in the appellant's  home.
    It is evident that the  judge  did  not  accept  the  son's  pro  forma
    statement that he was having difficulty finding a job  in  the  UK  and
    found an opportunity to work  in  France.  This  was  no  more  than  a
    manoeuvre designed to facilitate the appellant's application for an EEA
    residence card. It follows,  that  the  son's  time  in  France  was  a
    contrivance and not genuine. When the appellant arrived in  the  UK  in
    December 2011, the son was not in the  UK,  but  allegedly  in  France,
    until May 2012. He claimed to have worked in a toy  shop  for  about  5
    months. However, the evidence he relied on was not translated.  At  �20
    the judge correctly applied only limited weight to these documents.

21. It is clear from the determination read as a whole that the  judge  was
    not satisfied that there was any genuine employment in France and  that
    there  was  insufficient  translated  evidence  to   demonstrate   such
    employment. In no part of the decision does the judge accept that there
    is sufficient evidence that the son  was  genuinely  exercising  Treaty
    rights by working in France. Mr Raw suggested that it is  obvious  that
    the documents are wage  slips  and  bank  statements.  However,  it  is
    incumbent on the appellant to provide  translations  of  documents  she
    seeks  to  rely  on.  No  such  translations  were  provided.  In   the
    circumstances, even though the judge had applied the wrong  version  of
    regulation 9 and  considered  whether  the  centre  of  life  had  been
    relocated to France, it still  remains  the  case  that  the  appellant
    failed to make out qualification  under  regulation  9,  that  the  son
    resided in France as a worker or self-employed person before  returning
    to the UK. It is very clear that  this  is  an  entirely  unmeritorious
    claim, with contrived alleged work in France for the single purpose  to
    get round the requirements of the Regulations.

22. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no removal decision,  the  judge
    went  on  to  consider  the  appellant's  private   and   family   life
    circumstances both under the Rules and under article 8  ECHR,  reaching
    the conclusion at  �32  that  there  is  no  family  life  between  the
    appellant and her son or other family members such as to engage article
    8 ECHR and that the decision of the Secretary  of  State  was  entirely
    proportionate, following the Razgar five  step  approach.  I  find  the
    judge's conclusions in relation to private and family life  sustainable
    on the evidence and ones which the judge  was  entitled  to  reach.  It
    cannot be said that the decision in relation to article 8  is  perverse
    or one to which no judge properly directed could come. In particular as
    it is open to the appellant  to  make  a  fresh  application  providing
    proper translated evidence and as there  is  no  removal  decision,  it
    would be difficult to see how the decision of the  Secretary  of  State
    could ever be disproportionate to the appellant's  private  and  family
    life rights under article 8 ECHR.

23. In the circumstances, and for the reasons set out herein, I  find  that
    notwithstanding an error of law in the application of the  regulations,
    the outcome of the appeal would have been the same, regardless of which
    version of regulation 9 is to be applied.

Conclusion & Decision

24. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
