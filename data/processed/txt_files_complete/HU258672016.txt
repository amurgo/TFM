                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant, Faisal [S] is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 1 February
    1989. In October 2009 he entered with leave  as  a  student  which  was
    extended to expire on 28 September 2014. He met [KB]  and  their  child
    was born on [~] 2012.  On  28  September  2013  they  married  and  the
    Appellant was granted leave to remain as  a  spouse  until  16  October
    2016. In time, he applied for further leave as a spouse.



The SSHD's Original Decision

 2. On 8 November 2016 the Respondent refused the Appellant further  leave.
    He had fraudulently  obtained  a  TOEIC  certificate  from  Educational
    Testing Service (ETS); he did not meet the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM to show a minimum income of ï¿½18,600; he did  not  meet  the
    eligibility and suitability requirements and so his  relationship  with
    his child could not engage EX.1 of Appendix FM.

 3. The Appellant did not meet any of the  time  critical  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules and  there  were  no  very
    significant obstacles to his re-integration into  Bangladesh  where  he
    had lived for some twenty years and obtained a university degree before
    coming to the United Kingdom.  There were no exceptional  circumstances
    to warrant  the  grant  of  leave  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention outside the Immigration Rules.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 4. On 22 November 2016 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal under Section
    82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended  (the
    2002 Act).  The grounds are lengthy, asserting  the  Appellant's  TOEIC
    certificate was not obtained by fraud; that the Appellant  should  have
    been given the opportunity to obtain an employer's letter prior to  the
    decision being made and there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  his
    family life continuing in Bangladesh. The Respondent had not adequately
    considered the best interests of his British citizen child and that his
    wife had no connection to Bangladesh.

 5. By a decision promulgated on 26 March  2018  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Froom dismissed the appeal.

 6. On 23 July 2018 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Shimmin  granted  the
    Appellant permission to appeal on the grounds it was arguable the Judge
    had erred by:

       . failing to comply and consider Section EX .1

       . failing to give adequate reasons to support his finding there  were
         no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the   Appellant   returning   to
         Bangladesh with his wife and child

       . failing to make a finding about the Appellant's  private  life  and
         the obstacles to his re-integration into Bangladesh

       . failing to assess the Appellant's exceptional circumstances

       . failing properly to consider the proportionality of the decision

       . failing properly to consider the best interests of the  Appellant's
         child.

Proceedings in the Upper Tribunal

7.   The Appellant together with  his  wife  and  his  mother  attended  the
    hearing. I explained the purpose and procedure to be followed  and  the
    Appellant confirmed his address but otherwise neither he nor  his  wife
    took any active part in the proceedings.

Submissions for the Appellant

8.   Mr Rahman submitted that the Appellant had established  a  private  and
    family life in the United Kingdom and that his wife and child could not
    follow him to  Bangladesh  because  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to their integration  there.  The  Judge  had  accepted  that
    family life had been established. The decision to remove the  Appellant
    was disproportionate.

9.   Mr Rahman referred me to the hospital letter of 8 February 2018 in  the
    Appellant's bundle (AB) at  pp.123-124  about  the  Appellant's  wife's
    idiopathic intracranial hypertension. I enquired whether there was  any
    background  evidence  what  medical  facilities   were   available   in
    Bangladesh. He stated that a two-page extract  from  the  Internet  had
    been handed up at the hearing before Judge Froom but he did not have  a
    copy and I could not find a copy in the Tribunal file.

10.  He referred me to what the Judge had stated  at  paragraph  50  of  his
    decision and submitted that although  the  medical  evidence  may  show
    there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  in  relation   to   medical
    treatment, the Appellant's wife would not  receive  care  of  the  same
    calibre as she would in the United Kingdom. She had could not  live  in
    Bangladesh. The six grounds identified in the grant  of  Permission  to
    Appeal had been established and the decision should be set aside.

Submissions for the Respondent

11.  Ms Pal submitted the Judge had correctly set out the law  at  paragraph
    33 of his decision and at paragraphs  47ff.  had  referred  to  Section
    EX.1.  At  paragraphs  48-50  the  Judge  had  given  reasons  why  the
    Appellant's wife might  be  unwilling  to  go  to  Bangladesh  and  had
    considered the meaning of insurmountable obstacles in Section EX.2.  He
    had noted the wife was not currently receiving  medical  treatment  and
    concluded that they were no insurmountable obstacles  to  her  and  the
    Appellant with their child continuing the family life in Bangladesh.

12.   He  had  dealt  with  the  best  interests  of  their  child  and  the
    reasonableness of expecting the child to leave the  United  Kingdom  at
    paragraphs 53-56 and assessed the public interest and relevant  factors
    identified in s.117B of the 2002 Act. There was no error of law in  the
    decision which should stand.

Response for the Appellant

13.  Mr Rahman referred to the Judge's considerations  why  the  Appellant's
    wife could not relocate to Bangladesh and  reiterated  that  these  did
    amount to insurmountable obstacles, especially when  the  evidence  was
    that the wife's medical condition was being kept under  review  by  her
    doctor. He boldly asserted that notwithstanding  paragraph  52  of  the
    decision removal of the child was not possible. Further, the Judge  had
    not conducted any assessment of the  proportionality  of  the  original
    decision. This appeared not to take account of paragraphs 46ff. of  the
    Judge's decision  leading  to  his  finding  at  paragraph  64  on  its
    proportionality.

Findings and consideration

14.  The Judge found in favour of the Appellant  in  respect  of  his  TOEIC
    certificate and consequently that he met  suitability  requirements  of
    Appendix FM. He made a clear finding that the Appellant had  failed  to
    show that he met the financial requirements as indeed had been conceded
    for the Appellant: see paragraphs 46 and 63.

15.  He assessed the best interests of the Appellant's  child  at  paragraph
    54 and properly went on to consider whether it was reasonable to expect
    the child to relocate to Bangladesh. The child's best interests  are  a
    primary but not determinative consideration. At paragraphs  62  and  63
    the Judge gave a good reason  why  it  would  be  appropriate  for  the
    Appellant to return to Bangladesh to seek entry clearance if  his  wife
    and child were to remain in the United Kingdom. This was in  line  with
    paragraph 51 of the sole judgment in R (Agyarko) v SSHD [2017] UKSC  11
    where Lord Reed found:-

         "... whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is  entitled
         to remain in the UK only temporarily, however, the significance  of
         this consideration depends  on  what  the  outcome  of  immigration
         control might otherwise be. For  example,  if  an  applicant  would
         otherwise be automatically deported as a foreign criminal, then the
         weight of the public interest in his or her removal will  generally
         be very considerable. If, on the other hand, an applicant - even if
         residing in the UK unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted
         leave to enter, at least if an application were made  from  outside
         the UK, then there might be  no  public  interest  in  his  or  her
         removal ..."

16.  The Judge's decision is a carefully considered one  in  which  he  took
    account of the relevant factors both for and against the Appellant. The
    conclusion may be harsh for the Appellant and his  family  but  on  the
    evidence he was entitled to conclude it would not  be  unreasonable  or
    unduly harsh to require  the  Appellant  to  return  to  Pakistan.  The
    grounds for appeal essentially assert disagreement with the  Judge  and
    disclose no error of law. Consequently, the decision shall stand.

Post-hearing submissions

17.  Following the hearing and having regard to the fact this  decision  had
    not been promulgated before the Supreme Court handed down judgement  in
    KO and Others v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53, I gave the parties the opportunity
    to make written submissions on the judgment.  Submissions were received
    for the Appellant but not for the Respondent.

18.  The decision under appeal is a removal decision and so  the  references
    in the submissions to deportation in paragraphs 3-6 have little if  any
    relevance.

19.  The submissions note that in SSHD v VM (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA  Civ.  255
    at paragraph 64 in the only reasoned judgment Sales LJ  held  that  the
    presence of children in the United Kingdom, including British citizens,
    did not, as a result of the operation of EU law, have to be treated  as
    a fixed point for the purposes of the  proportionality  analysis  under
    Article 8.  They further note that at paragraph 44 of  KO  the  Supreme
    Court affirmed such a view.  The Judge dealt with  the  evidence  about
    the possibility of relocation of the family  at  paragraph  61  of  his
    decision and his understanding of the jurisprudence is confirmed by the
    later judgment in TZ (Pakistan) v SSHD [2018] EWCA  Civ.1109  in  which
    the Senior  President  giving  the  only  reasoned  judgment  found  at
    paragraph 25 that:

         "The settled jurisprudence of the ECtHR is that it is likely to  be
         only in an exceptional case that article 8 will necessitate a grant
         of leave to remain where a non-settled migrant has commenced family
         life in the UK at a time when his  or  her  immigration  status  is
         precarious ... Where precariousness success it affects  the  weight
         to be attached to family life in the balancing exercise.   That  is
         because article 8 does  not  guarantee  a  right  to  choose  one's
         country  of  residence.   Both  the  unlawfully  overstay  and  the
         temporary migrant have no right to remain in the UK simply  because
         they enter into a relationship with a British citizen during  their
         unlawful or temporary stay ..."

20.   The  Judge  gave  sustainable  reasons  for  his  conclusion  on   the
    Appellant's claim based on Article 8.

21.  The Judge's decision is a carefully considered one  in  which  he  took
    account of the relevant factors both for  and  against  the  Appellant.
    The conclusion may be harsh for the Appellant and his family but it  is
    not unreasonable or unduly harsh.  Notwithstanding the numerous grounds
    on which permission to appeal was granted, I conclude that there is  no
    material error of law in the Judge's decision such that  it  should  be
    set aside.  Accordingly, it shall stand.

Anonymity

17.  There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  considered
    the appeal I find none is warranted.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain an error of law
    and shall stand.  The effect is that the appeal  of  the  Appellant  is
    dismissed.
    No anonymity direction is made.
