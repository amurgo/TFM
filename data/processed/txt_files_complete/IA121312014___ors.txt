                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants and each of them are citizens of Japan born respectively
    on 13th April 2006, 22nd October 1969 and  13th  February  1980.   They
    made various applications in order that  they  might  regularise  their
    stay in the United Kingdom.  The first Appellant's application was made
    pursuant to paragraph 276ADE.  The second Appellant's  application  was
    made initially also under 276ADE, but later pursuant to a  Section  120
    notice reliance was placed on paragraph 276A1, and in relation  to  the
    third Appellant the application was initially made under 276A1 but then
    changed pursuant to that 120 notice to 276B.

 2. The substance of  the  applications  was  that  the  second  and  third
    Appellants, the parents of the first Appellant had been resident in the
    United Kingdom for a continuous ten year period.

 3. On 25th February 2014 decisions were made by the Secretary of State  to
    refuse the applications and to remove the Appellants  from  the  United
    Kingdom pursuant to Section 47  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2006.  The Appellants appealed and their appeals were  heard
    on 8th October 2014 by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fox sitting  at
    Richmond.  He dismissed each of the appeals.  Not  content  with  those
    decisions, by Notice dated 10th December 2014 application was  made  by
    the Appellants and each of them for permission to appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. On 21st January 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Osborne  refused
    permission.  There was then a renewed application  dated  2nd  February
    2015. The matter was then considered by Upper Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor
    who granted permission in these terms:

         "The First-tier Tribunal correctly directs itself as to the  issues
         before it in relation to the first and second Appellants,  although
         not to the third Appellant - it incorrectly directing  itself  that
         the third Appellant sought to assert he  met  the  requirements  of
         paragraph 276A2 of the Rules [19], rather than paragraph 276B [36].
          This, though, is not an error capable of affecting the outcome  of
         the appeal, given the material correlation between the requirements
         of both  Rules.   However,  it  is  arguable  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal gave no meaningful consideration to these issues, and that
         its reasoning in relation to such - found exclusively at  paragraph
         47 of his determination - falls short of  bring  legally  adequate.
         These errors also arguably  impact  on  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
         conclusions in relation to the first Appellant."

 5. Even before the  matter  came  for  hearing  before  me  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal,  having  considered  the  papers  I  questioned  whether  the
    reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal was adequate.  It is not necessary
    for me to consider matters further.  Mr Wilding and Mr Slatter had  had
    the opportunity in advance of my coming into  the  hearing  to  discuss
    whether or not there were material errors in the statement of  reasons.
    Mr Wilding very fairly opened by  accepting,  in  his  words  that  the
    decision was, "Back to front".  The reasoning in relation to the  third
    Appellant was inadequate and there was no  sufficient  finding  whether
    the second Appellant met the requirements of paragraph 276B or  in  the
    alternative  276A1.  In  those  circumstances  he  accepted  that   the
    assessment by the judge in relation to Joshua, the first Appellant,  at
    [44] and in relation to the second and third Appellants at [45]  simply
    could not stand.  Therefore, by consent the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal was to be set aside through an error of law.  Of course it  is
    not sufficient when it comes to matters of law for the parties to agree
    that there is an error of law, I have to find that  for  myself  but  I
    have no hesitation  in  so  finding.   Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor
    rightly points to paragraph 47 as being inadequate and  there  are  not
    sufficient findings necessary for the  decision  which  was  eventually
    made in this case to be sustainable.

 6. Having set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal I  can  either
    remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal or  re-make  the  decision.
    However in this case there are discretionary aspects of the case  which
    means that the matter is not quite so straightforward; still I need  to
    make some findings with findings needing to be made in respect  of  the
    third and second Appellants.

 7. One important aspect of the appeal in relation to the second and  third
    Appellants was whether when they apparently  left  the  United  Kingdom
    they did so at a time when they had leave.  At paragraph 7 reference is
    made to the third Appellant departing from the United  Kingdom  on  1st
    March 2006.  If he did so then as Mr Wilding rights points out he would
    not have had leave since he had leave only to 28th February 2006.

 8. When did the third Appellant leave ie on 28 February 2006, when he  had
    leave or the following day, when he did not? In his  witness  statement
    to the First tier Tribunal the third Appellant deposed to  having  left
    on 28th February 2006 by South Korean Airlines.   The  flight  departed
    21:30pm though he arrived at his first interim destination on 1st March
    2006.  That same evidence was adopted before me without challenge by Mr
    Wilding and so, I find as a fact  on  the  basis  of  the  unchallenged
    evidence that on balance of probabilities the third Appellant left  the
    United Kingdom on 28th February.  It follows then that  on  this  point
    there was a material error in the findings of fact  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal but for these purposes the significant point is that the third
    Appellant had leave at all material times necessary for the purposes of
    the Rules.

 9. Although it is conceded that both the second and third Appellants  have
    been continuously resident in the  United  Kingdom  for  ten  years  Mr
    Wilding rightly pointed out that that did not  necessarily  lead  to  a
    successful outcome.

10. As to the third Appellant there is in respect  of  paragraph  276B(ii),
    which deals with the public interest, a discretion in the Secretary  of
    State and Mr Slatter agrees and indeed was helpful in reminding  me  of
    the authority of GK (long  residence  -  immigration  history)  Lebanon
    [2008] UKAIT 00011 which is directly on point.

11. As to the second Appellant, consideration needs to  be  given  both  to
    276B(ii) and also to (iv) which requires her to demonstrate  sufficient
    knowledge of the English language and sufficient knowledge  about  life
    in the United Kingdom in accordance  with  the  relevant  Appendix  and
    there is of course the alternative of 276A1.

12. That then leaves the child Appellant, Joshua  (there  is  also  another
    child).  The First-tier Tribunal could not really make  sound  findings
    as to what was in the best interests  of  Joshua  without  knowing  the
    status of the second and third Appellants and that applies to me  also.
    This is one family and proper consideration needs to be  given  to  the
    family as a whole.  There is also the second child born in  the  United
    Kingdom whose status must also be considered and I mention that in this
    Statement of Reasons so as to remind the  Secretary  of  State  of  the
    existence of this child when exercising her discretion in  relation  to
    the second and third Appellants.

13. It was agreed that were I to re-make the decision favourable to each of
    the Appellants the matter should be  not  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal but rather I should simply allow the appeal so as to allow the
    Secretary of State to exercise  her  discretion  and  that  is  what  I
    propose to do.

14. For the avoidance of doubt I find in respect of both the second and the
    third Appellants that they have ten years' continuous residence in  the
    United Kingdom demonstrated to the appropriate standard of proof within
    the meaning of 276A(a). The Secretary of State is  reminded  that  when
    exercising her discretion she should have regard to paragraphs 298  and
    301.

Notice of Decision

15. The appeals of each of the Appellant to the Upper Tribunal are allowed.
     The Decision of the First Tier Tribunal is set aside and  remade  such
    that the appeals are allowed as not being in accordance with the law.

16. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

payable, I have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  fee
award of �140 in respect of each Appellant so that the  award  in  total  in
this appeal is  �420.
