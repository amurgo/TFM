Representation:

For the claimants:     Mr Naveed, instructed by RW Anderson & Co
For the appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Pratima Poyroo, date of birth 21.5.84, and her dependant
    husband, Mr Vishal Ackloo, date of birth 4.6.77, are both  citizens  of
    Mauritius.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ievins promulgated on 6.6.14, who  allowed
    the claimants' appeals against the decisions of the Secretary of  State
    to refuse their applications made  on  28.9.12  for  further  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier  4  (General)  Student,  and  to
    remove them from the UK by way of directions pursuant to section 47  of
    the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 28.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lambert  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    30.6.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 27.8.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal. However, the  claimants'  representative  fell  ill  and  was
    unable to attend  the  hearing,  thus  it  was  adjourned  to  29.9.14,
    reserved to myself.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Ievins should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background is that the first claimant was granted leave to
    enter the UK as a  student  in  2005.  I  understand  that  the  second
    claimant has been in the UK since 14.10.14. The first claimant's  leave
    was  subsequently  extended  until  14.10.13,  with  her   husband   as
    dependant. However, on 2.8.12, her leave was curtailed so as to  expire
    on 1.10.12. Before the expiry of the  curtailed  leave,  the  claimants
    made applications for further leave to remain. It  is  the  refusal  of
    those applications that is the subject of the present appeal.

 7. The application made on 28.9.12 was for the first claimant to study for
    an extended diploma  in  strategic  management  and  leadership  at  St
    Patrick's International College from 26.9.12 to 20.9.13. As  the  first
    claimant had already exceeded the maximum amount of time  to  study  at
    degree level or above, which was the reason for curtailment  of  leave,
    the application was refused.

 8. Judge Ievins allowed the claimants' appeals on the basis:

      a) That time did not run until the first  claimant  commenced  studies
         under the PBS;

      b) That not all of her studies were at degree level;

      c) That an incomplete course did not count towards the period;

      d) That in the circumstances she had not yet reached the 5 year limit;

 9. Unfortunately, the judge was wrong on every count.

10. In granting permission to appeal Judge Lambert found it  arguable  that
    the Judge erred in failing to have regard to  paragraph  245ZX(ha)  and
    the case of Islam [2013] UKUT 00608.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Lambert also found it  arguable
    that there was an error of law in the  judge's  reliance  on  a  Policy
    Guidance issued on its face as being applicable to Tier 4  applications
    made on or after April 2014. The application the subject of appeal  was
    made in 2012.

12. The decision of the Secretary of State  was  made  on  the  basis  that
    paragraph 245ZX(ha) provides that if the course is at degree  level  or
    above, the grant of leave to remain the applicant is seeking  must  not
    lead to the applicant having spent more than 5 years in  the  UK  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Migrant, or as a student, studying courses  at  degree
    level or above, unless certain exceptions set out in 245ZX(i) to  (iii)
    apply.

13. As Islam [2013] UKUT 00608 explained, the wording  "or  as  a  student"
    means that in calculating the period of time,  the  period  before  the
    introduction of the Tier 4 system has to be taken into account, nothing
    in relevant Guidance permits a contrary result. Thus all the  time  the
    appellant has spent in the UK studying courses at degree level or above
    has to be  taken  into  account  whether  or  not  it  was  before  the
    introduction of the Points Based System (PBS), and whether or  not  the
    claimant completed any such course.

14. Thus, contrary to the findings of the First-tier  Tribunal  all  degree
    level study in the UK counts towards the 5 year limit, whether  or  not
    she completed any of her courses.

15. Without needing to detail it  here,  a  list  of  the  various  courses
    studies by the first claimant is on the case papers. It is  clear  from
    that list produced by the Secretary of State, and Mr  Naveed  conceded,
    that she had already studies at degree level  for  more  than  5  years
    prior to the 2012 application.

16. The Guidance relied on at the First-tier Tribunal  was  that  in  force
    from April 2014, and not the Guidance in force at the date of decision,
    8.5.13. Further, the  paragraph  107  referred  to  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge at �9 of the determination related to  persons  studying
    below degree level. Paragraphs 109 relates the limit  of  5  years  for
    study at or above degree level.

17. In the circumstances,  the  application  of  Ms  Poyroo  was  correctly
    refused and as her dependant, Mr Ackloo's application also  failed.  Mr
    Naveed conceded at the hearing before me that they could not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

18. It follows that Judge Ievins was in error in concluding at �10  of  the
    determination that as the points based system (PBS) came into force  in
    April 2009 policy guidance meant that time spent as a student under the
    previous Immigration Rules does not count towards the time limit.

19. In the circumstances, I found such error of law in the  making  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal that it should  be  set  aside  and
    remade.

20. As the directions issued by the First-tier Tribunal advised the parties
    to prepare for the hearing before  on  the  basis  that  if  the  Upper
    Tribunal found an error of law it may proceed immediately to remake the
    decision in the appeal, I indicated to the parties that I would do so.

21. The skeleton argument submitted on behalf of the claimants asserts that
    the second claimant is entitled to leave to remain  under  the  10-year
    long residence provisions of paragraph 276B. However, there was no such
    application made to the Secretary of State, when  the  application  for
    leave to remain as Tier 4 (General) Student and dependant was  made  on
    28.9.12. Obviously, there has been no  decision  in  relation  to  long
    residence and thus there can be no appeal against a decision not  made.
    Furthermore, the 10 years is not yet reached and will not do  so  until
    14.10.14.

22. I reject the submission of Mr Naveed that as the  second  claimant  can
    make an application now, within 28 days of reaching the 10 year period,
    I should allow the appeal on that ground. If he wishes to make any such
    application that is a matter  for  him,  but  there  is  before  me  no
    decision and no appeal in relation to 276B of the Immigration Rules and
    even if there was, he does not meet the requirements.

23. Mr Naveed then relied on private and family life under article  8  EHCR
    and submitted that it would be disproportionate to remove the claimants
    in all the circumstances. Before I can do so,  I  must  first  consider
    private and family life under the Immigration Rules before  I  consider
    the recent case law.

24. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be  the  same;  what  matters  is  that
    proportionality balancing exercise is required to be carried  out.  The
    Court of Appeal  observed  that  it  was  inclined  to  the  view  that
    insurmountable  obstacles  (the  test  under  exception  EX1)  did  not
    literally mean obstacles  which  it  is  impossible  to  surmount,  but
    implied a reasonableness test. In other words, a  proportionality  test
    is required whether under the new rules or article 8. MF (Nigeria)  was
    followed in Kabia (MF: para 398  -  "exceptional  circumstances")  2013
    UKUT 00569 (IAC).

25. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal set out, inter alia, that on the current state
    of the authorities:


            (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on  the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin);


           (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such as
           Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount:
           MF (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria  [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC);
           Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013]  UKUT  00045  (IAC);  they
           concern  the  practical  possibilities  of  relocation.  In  the
           absence of such insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to
           show other non-standard and  particular  features  demonstrating
           that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


26. It is illustrative that in Gulshan the Upper Tribunal  considered  that
    it was not unduly harsh for a husband who originated from Pakistan  but
    was now a British national, to return to Pakistan with his wife who was
    seeking leave to remain as his spouse. The panel acknowledged that  the
    couple would suffer some hardship, as he had been in the UK since 2002,
    he had worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and
    other state benefits,  some  of  which  could  not  be  transferred  to
    Pakistan.


27. In Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal also held:

    (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify  in  her
         decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
         prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
         the materials before it.

     (ii)  "Maintenance of effective immigration  control"  whilst  not  as
         such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR  can  normally
         be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of  disorder  or
         crime" or an aspect of "economic  well-being  of  the  country"  or
         both.

     (iii)  "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is  normally  a  legitimate
         aim both in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct
         on the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases where there have
         only been breaches of immigration law.

     (iv)  MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held that the new  immigration
         rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal  are  a  complete
         code. This was because  of  the  express  requirement  in  them  at
         paragraph 398 to have regard to exceptional circumstances and other
         factors.

     (v)     It follows from this that any other rule which has  a  similar
         provision will also constitute a complete code;

     (vi)   Where an area of the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

28. I am not satisfied that family life is engaged at all in this case. The
    claimants have family life with each other. They have no children. They
    will be returning to their home country together and can continue their
    family life there. It was not argued before  me  that  either  of  them
    meets the requirements of Appendix FM for leave to remain. Neither  has
    any entitlement to remain except  whilst  the  second  claimant  was  a
    student.

29. I have considered paragraph 276ADE, but the claimants  have  not  shown
    that they have lost all ties, including  family,  cultural  and  social
    with Mauritius. Mr Naveed made no  such  submissions  and  I  heard  no
    evidence to that effect. They have lived most of their lives  in  their
    home country and retain the language and have family there.

30. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that even in relation  to  private
    and family life the claimants do  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

31. There was an express mechanism in the Immigration Rules for considering
    exceptional circumstances under paragraph 276ADE 'no ties' test,  which
    is  in  effect  an   exceptional   circumstances   or   proportionality
    assessment, making provision for leave to remain where  a  person  does
    not meet the long residence requirements but has no remaining ties with
    his home  country,  including  social,  cultural  and  family.  In  the
    circumstances this may be regarded as a complete code.

32. The claimants have  not  demonstrated  any  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules so  as
    to justify granting leave to remain outside the Rules under  article  8
    ECHR private and family life on the basis  that  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State is unduly harsh.  In  the  circumstances  I  am  not
    satisfied that there is any justification  for  considering  article  8
    private or family life outside the Rules.

33. However, even if I am wrong on that I have considered the Razgar steps,
    of which the crucial issue is the proportionality  balancing  exercise.
    In that assessment  balancing  on  the  one  hand  the  rights  of  the
    claimants and on the other the legitimate  and  necessary  aim  of  the
    state to protect the economic well-being of the UK through  immigration
    control, I find that the decision to remove is entirely proportionate.

34. Mr Naveed urged on me that as the second claimant was close to reaching
    the  10  year  threshold  I  should  take  that  into  account  in  the
    proportionality assessment. In essence this is  a  near-miss  argument.
    There is no such thing as near miss in the  Immigration  Rules,  as  is
    clear from established case law. However, I do take  into  account  the
    length of residence in the UK. Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261: Burnton LJ, at
    �26  stated,  "In  my  judgement,  there  is  no  Near-Miss   principle
    applicable in the Immigration Rules. The Secretary  of  State,  and  on
    appeal the Tribunal, must assess the strength of an  article  8  claim,
    but the requirements of immigration control  is  not  weakened  by  the
    degree of non-compliance with the Immigration Rules."

35. It is not open to the Tribunal to allow the appeal on the  basis  of  a
    near miss, as held in MM and SA (Pankina: near-miss). In  Patel  [2013]
    UKSC 72 Lord Carnwath said:
             "55. Thus the balance drawn by the rules may  be  relevant  to
            the consideration of proportionality......
            56.   Although the context of the rules may be relevant to  the
            consideration of proportionality....this cannot be equated with
            a formalised "near-miss" or "sliding  scale"  principle.....Mrs
            Huang's case for favourable treatment outside the rules did not
            turn on how close she had come to compliance with rule 317, but
            on the application of the family  values  which  underlie  that
            rule and are at the heart of article 8. conversely, a near-miss
            under the rules cannot provide substance to a human rights case
            which is otherwise lacking in merit.
            57.   It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a
            general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished  from  the
            Secretary of  States'  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
            outside the rules, which may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected
            human right...."

36. I also am required to have regard  to  section  117B(5)   that  "Little
    weight should be given to a private life established by a person  at  a
    time when the person's immigration status is precarious." The claimants
    have no legitimate expectation to be able to remain  in  the  UK  other
    than under Immigration Rules. I have to take  into  account  that  they
    have been unable to meet the Immigration Rules  and  that  as  students
    they must be taken to have expected to leave the UK  on  completion  of
    the studies. The second claimant last studied  in  September  2013  and
    since then has stayed at home  whilst the first claimant has worked.

37. I also have to bear in mind that in Nasim and others (article 8) [2014]
    UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper   Tribunal   considered   whether   the
    hypothetical removal of the 22 PBS claimants, pursuant to the  decision
    to refuse to vary leave,  would  violate  the  UK's  obligations  under
    article 8 ECHR. Whilst each case must be determined on its merits,  the
    Tribunal noted that the judgements of the Supreme Court  in  Patel  and
    Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72,  "serve  to  re-focus  attention  on  the
    nature and purpose of article 8 of the  ECHR  and,  in  particular,  to
    recognise that article's limited utility in private life cases that are
    far removed from the protection of an individual's moral  and  physical
    integrity."

38. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."

39. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:
         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."

40. The panel pointed out  that  at  this  point  on  the  continuum,  "the
    essential elements of the private  life  relied  on  will  normally  be
    transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in  their
    essential respects, following a person's return to their home  country,
    (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its limited utility to an individual where
    one has moved along the continuum, from that  Article's  core  area  of
    operation towards what might be described as its  fuzzy  penumbra.  The
    limitation arises, both from what will at that point  normally  be  the
    tangential effect on the individual of the  proposed  interference  and
    from the fact that, unless there are particular reasons to  reduce  the
    public interest of enforcing immigration controls, that  interest  will
    consequently prevail in  striking  the  proportionality  balance  (even
    assuming that stage is reached)." In the circumstances, the  claimants'
    rights to private life developed  whilst  as  students  carries  little
    weight against the public interest  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise.

41. I take into account all that I have been able to glean from the  papers
    before  me  and  from  the  evidence  and  witness  statements  of  the
    claimants. Mr Naveed did not want to call any oral evidence, but agreed
    for me to ask the first claimant for some detail of her private life in
    the UK. She spoke of going to  the  leisure  centre  and  jogging  with
    friends, but other than attendance at church on Sundays she was  unable
    to point me to any community links or associations. I accept that  they
    will  both  have  a  circle  of  friends  and  associates,  but   those
    relationships can be continued from outside the UK through modern means
    of communication and do not demand their presence in the UK. There  was
    nothing particularly remarkable  or  significant  about  their  private
    lives, which were no more than one would expect in the circumstances.

42. In all the circumstances, I find that there is nothing disproportionate
    in the decision of the Secretary of State so  as  to  justify  granting
    leave to remain in the UK.

Conclusion & Decision:

43. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by  dismissing  the
                    appeal of each appellant.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed.
