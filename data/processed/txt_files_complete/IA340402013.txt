Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Ahmed, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Philippines born on  17th  May  1989.
    The Appellant first arrived in the United Kingdom on  10th  April  2012
    with leave to enter as a visitor valid to 2nd  October  2012.   On  7th
    July 2012 the Appellant applied for leave to remain  in  the  UK.   The
    Appellant's appeal was refused by the Secretary of State by  Notice  of
    Refusal letter dated 2nd September 2013.  That refusal was based on the
    contention that the Appellant could not  meet  the  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules and that  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances
    consistent with the right  to  respect  for  private  and  family  life
    contained in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The
    Appellant's application was to enter the UK  under  the  partner  route
    relying on her relationship with Terence Samuel Bruce.

 2. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Maxwell sitting at Hatton Cross on 23rd June 2014.  In  a
    determination promulgated on 30th June 2014 the Appellant's appeal  was
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 3. On 4th July 2014 Grounds of Appeal were lodged to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    On 16th July 2014 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant-Hutchison  granted
    permission to appeal.  The judge noted  that  the  application  to  the
    Secretary of State had been for  an  extension  of  stay  as  a  person
    settled and present in the UK and that it was submitted that the  judge
    had arguably erred in law by (a) failing to consider that in  terms  of
    Appendix FM-SE the Sponsor's state pension can be  taken  into  account
    for the purposes of meeting the financial requirements test and (b)  in
    making adequate  findings  in  connection  with  the  Sponsor's  health
    conditions.

 4. On 29th July 2014 the Secretary of State responded to  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal under Rule 24.  The  response  opposed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    noting that the First-tier Tribunal Judge properly considered Article 8
    having regard to the Appellant's husband's health and  that  the  judge
    properly took into account that the Appellant could not  succeed  under
    the Rules prior to July 2012.  The Rule 24 response contended that  the
    judge had given adequate reasons for the findings made and  that  there
    was no material error of law in the determination.

 5. It is on that basis that the appeal comes before me.  The Appellant  is
    represented by her instructed Counsel Ms Ahmed.  The Secretary of State
    appears by her Home Office Presenting Officer Ms Everett.

Relevant Documents

 6. I am referred in this appeal, albeit initially, that the  issue  before
    me is to whether or not there  is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  and  in  particular  to  the
    extremely helpful skeleton argument provided by Counsel and to the very
    detailed relevant bundle (at least relevant  to  whether  the  decision
    should be remade if I find a material error of law) extending  to  some
    143 pages and including additional witness statements dated 27th August
    2014 both from the Appellant and from her Sponsor, Mr Bruce.





Submissions/Discussions and Relevant Accepted Facts

 7. The Secretary of State does not dispute  the  relationship  between  Mr
    Bruce and the Appellant.  It is noted and the Secretary of  State  does
    not challenge that originally the parties planned  to  get  married  on
    20th September 2012 but were unable to do so  because  the  Appellant's
    passport was retained by the Home Office.  However it is accepted  that
    they live together and that they are engaged to be married.

 8. Ms Ahmed submits the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was  wrong  to  have
    claimed that the Sponsor's state pension cannot be used towards meeting
    the financial requirements  because  Appendix  FM-SE  accepts  this  as
    earnings and consequently he has erred in law.  Ms Everett acknowledges
    that there is an error herein by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  but
    comments that  the  question  remains  as  to  whether  that  error  is
    material.  Ms Ahmed responds that the Sponsor's salaried employment and
    pension  combined  together  meet  the  income  threshold  of   �18,600
    therefore the judge has materially erred in law.  Further  she  submits
    that at paragraph 21 of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  determination
    he did not consider adequately the significance  of  Chikwamba  v  SSHD
    [2008] UKHL 40 which she submits makes plain that in appeals where  the
    only  matter  weighing  on  the  Respondent's  side  of  an  Article  8
    proportionality  balance  is  the  public  policy   of   requiring   an
    application to be made under the Immigration Rules  from  abroad,  that
    legitimate objective will usually be outweighed by factors  resting  on
    the Appellant's side of the balance.  She submits that both the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge and the Secretary of State failed to consider  that
    the Appellant can succeed under the Immigration Rules, namely  Appendix
    FM, and that the First-tier Tribunal Judge was more  concerned  whether
    the removal of both the Appellant and  the  Sponsor  was  proportionate
    rather than consider  whether  the  Appellant  can  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules which Ms Ahmed submits that  it  is  clear  that  she
    does.  In stating this Ms Ahmed is clearly in direct contradiction with
    the suggestion at  paragraph  6  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    determination that it was purportedly conceded  by  the  representative
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal   (and   Ms   Ahmed   was   not   the
    representative) that the Appellant could only rely on Article 8 and not
    pursue her claim  under  the  Rules.   Unfortunately  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer's notes do not assist Ms Everett in  being  able  to
    comment on that scenario.

 9. Ms Everett submits the case is distinguishable from Chikwamba regarding
    the Appellant's intention in coming to this country  and  submits  that
    the reasons have not been made out and therefore it is appropriate  for
    her to reapply and that it would be necessary for the Appellant to show
    to any Entry Clearance Officer that she could now meet the  Immigration
    Rules.

10. Ms Ahmed's response  is  to  point  out  that  had  the  judge  applied
    Chikwamba there would have been a different outcome.







The Law

11.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

12. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.



Findings on Error of Law

13. It is difficult to  reconcile  the  concession  that  the  appeal  only
    proceeds  under  Article  8  allegedly  made  at  paragraph  6  of  the
    determination with paragraph 15  where  there  is  clear  reference  to
    argument as to whether or not the Appellant does or  does  not  satisfy
    the requirement of the Immigration Rules.  Further and  importantly  at
    paragraph  21  of  the  determination  the  judge  concludes  that  the
    Appellant's state pension cannot be taken into account when meeting the
    requirements of Appendix FM.  That is wrong and is an error of law.  It
    is also material and would  have  affected  the  manner  in  which  the
    argument pursuant to Chikwamba was put.  To  that  extent  I  therefore
    find there is a material error of law and set aside the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal and proceed to remake the decision.



Submissions

14. Ms Everett submits that this is a case of  proportionality  and  it  is
    necessary for it to be demonstrated in a very  specific  way  what  the
    Sponsor earns and it is not just good enough to say how much  that  is.
    Ms Ahmed refers me  to  Section  3.61  which  sets  out  the  financial
    requirements necessary through adequate maintenance and points out that
    these requirements were before the Secretary  of  State  and  that  the
    Sponsor's income covers the period 2013  to  2014  and  therefore  they
    constitute the specified  evidence  that  was  required.   She  further
    submits that if the Appellant's pensions along  with  his  income  from
    employment are calculated it will  be  shown  that  he  has  totals  of
    earnings in 2013 of �26,345.89 and all earnings in 2014 of  �27,182.92.
    She points out that quite simply  the  Appellant  meets  the  financial
    requirements and that it is therefore appropriate to follow  the  basic
    principles in Chikwamba and to allow the appeal.

15.  Ms  Everett  whilst  not  challenging  the  financial  position  still
    maintains the Secretary of  State's  position  that  the  case  can  be
    distinguished from Chikwamba.



Findings

16. Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules  Section  10(e)  sets  out  the
    permissible pension and evidence allowed under the  Immigration  Rules.
    The  Respondent's  policy  guidance  entitled  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions Family Members under Appendix FM and Appendix Armed Forces
    of the Immigration Rules, Appendix FM  Section  FM  1.7  sets  out  the
    financial requirements for a pension to be included.   Paragraph  8.1.1
    states,

         "8.1.1   The gross annual income from any  State  (UK  Basic  State
                Pension and Additional or Second State  Pension,  HM  Forces
                Pension or foreign)  or  private  pension  received  by  the
                applicant's partner or the applicant can be counted  towards
                the financial requirement.

         8.1.2    The annual pension income may be counted where the pension
                has become a source of income at least 28 days prior to  the
                application.

         8.1.3    The source can be combined with income  from  Category  A:
                salaried and non-salaried employment, part (1)  of  Category
                B: salaried and non-salaried employment,  Category  C:  non-
                employment income and Category D: cash savings in  order  to
                meet the financial requirement.

         8.1.4    The gross amount of any State or private pension  received
                by the applicant's partner, or the applicant in  the  twelve
                months prior to the date of application can be combined with
                part  (2)  of  Category   B:   salaried   and   non-salaried
                employment."

17. It is consequently clear that pension and employment  earnings  can  be
    combined together to meet the financial requirement and that when  that
    is done the figures stipulated above represent not only  the  financial
    position of the Sponsor but also  the  amount  of  money  that  he  was
    entitled to rely upon for meeting the  requirements  financially  under
    the Immigration Rules and it is clear that he meets those requirements.
     Thereafter it is necessary to analyse whether it is proportionate  for
    the Appellant to leave the UK and apply  for  entry  clearance  knowing
    that the financial requirement is met.  I agree with the analysis given
    of such a scenario to Chikwamba as set  out  by  Ms  Ahmed  and  whilst
    appreciating that the Secretary of State seeks to distinguish  it  that
    was based on the false premise that originally the  appellant  did  not
    meet the financial  requirements.   On  the  basis  that  she  did  and
    applying correctly the principles set out in Chickwamba the  appeal  is
    consequently remade and allowed under the Immigration Rules.



Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law.  That decision is set aside and the decision  is  remade  allowing
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

19. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.   No
    application is made to vary that order and none is made.
