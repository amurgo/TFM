                     Entry Clearance Officer: Abu Dhabi

                                                                   Appellant

                                                                  Respondent
Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the sake of convenience, I refer to the  appellant  as  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer and the respondent as "the claimant."


   2. I am satisfied that notice of hearing was given  to  the  claimant  on
      30th May 2014 in which the date, time and place of the hearing is  set
      out. He was also notified that if his representative  did  not  attend
      the hearing, the Tribunal may determine the appeal in his absence.


   3. The claimant is a national of Syria, who applied to visit his  friends
      in the UK  to  do  some  shopping  for  a  period  of  ten  days.  His
      application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on 2nd  October
      2013. He was not satisfied that the claimant is a genuine visitor,  or
      that he would return to the UAE at the end of the visit.


   4. The Entry Clearance Officer noted that  the  claimant  had  previously
      travelled to the UK and that he had met the requirements as a  Tier  1
      Post-Study Migrant visitor. However, each case has to  be  decided  on
      its own merits. His last UK visa had been issued three years  ago.  He
      claimed that he was employed as a legal researcher from January  2012,
      earning �1,930  a  month.  His  bank  statement  showed  deposits  not
      commensurate with his claimed salary.


   5. Accordingly, the Entry  Clearance  Officer  could  not  ascertain  the
      origin of all the deposits into his account. He also stated  that  the
      visit would cost him an  amount  which  was  four  times  his  monthly
      salary. Nor was the ECO satisfied that he received additional  income.
      The Entry Clearance Officer was unable  to  ascertain  the  origin  of
      those  funds  into  his  account  and  was  not  satisfied  that   his
      circumstances were as set out or that the bank statement reflected  an
      accurate picture of his financial position. The claimant is single; no
      one is dependent on him; has no property  and  has  demonstrated  only
      limited ties to the UAE. He had also shown at one  time  a  desire  to
      remain in the UK  in  a  long  term  category,  which  led  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer to doubt that only a short  visit  was  intended  at
      present. The Entry Clearance Officer was not  satisfied  that  he  had
      accurately presented his circumstances or intentions.


   6. The notice of refusal stated that his right of appeal was  limited  to
      the grounds referred to in s.84(1)(c) of the Nationality,  Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002.


   7. In his grounds of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  claimant
      joined issue with the ECO's decision on the merits. He  also  asserted
      that the decision was unlawful under s.19(b) of the Race Relations Act
      1976 and that the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was taken on
      "race discrimination grounds" by focusing on the civil  war  in  Syria
      and considering him an immigration threat regardless of  his  personal
      circumstances. There is direct discrimination by the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer since he has  been  treated  less  favourably  on  nationality
      grounds. The situation in Syria "shall not affect the judgement of the
      Entry Clearance Officer"; each applicant should be assessed separately
      without "stereotyping."


   8. In a determination promulgated on 17th April 2014 First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Kempton upheld the claimant's appeal under  the  Race  Relations
      Act.  She referred to the grounds of appeal noting that  the  claimant
      was previously a student and his parents  paid  for  his  studies  and
      maintenance. He has a good job and is working for a well  reputed  law
      firm in the UAE. He lives in Dubai and earns  �23,000.  There  was  no
      reason why he could not afford the expenses of a UK visit.


   9. The Judge properly noted that she was limited  in  the  scope  of  the
      grounds of appeal as the application had been  made  after  25th  June
      2013 when the rules changed in connection with limiting the grounds of
      appeal in visitor visa applications [11]. He had  not  applied  for  a
      family visitor visa and could not  present  a  claim  in  relation  to
      Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.


  10. With regard to Race Relations, it was easy to  see  how  the  claimant
      might reach such a conclusion. He had previously been granted visas to
      the UK and has an extant visa to the USA. He has travelled here in the
      past and has not overstayed. In the past,  he  was  dependent  on  his
      parents. He is now independent and works and looks  after  himself  in
      the UAE. His situation is now different.


  11.  She  found  at   paragraph   12   that   regarding   allegations   of
      discrimination, the claimant does appear to  have  suffered  "indirect
      discrimination" and apparently has a settled life and work in the UAE,
      but his nationality as a Syrian has now seemed to become the  unspoken
      focus in this appeal. The only matter which in fact  has  changed  for
      this claimant is that since his last application for a visa to the UK,
      the civil war in Syria has erupted. There is no logical reason why his
      application has been refused  and  appears  to  be  a  clear  case  of
      indirect discrimination on the grounds of race.


  12. The Entry Clearance Officer applied for permission to  appeal  against
      that decision. On 21st May 2014, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Omotosho
      granted the Entry Clearance Officer permission.  Firstly,  the  appeal
      was determined on the papers and there is no  indication  on  file  to
      show that the Entry Clearance Officer was afforded the opportunity  to
      comment regarding the allegation of  race  discrimination.  There  was
      also no record of any evidence adduced by the claimant to support  the
      assertion made. Crucially,  that  consideration  was  limited  to  one
      paragraph where it was concluded that the claimant had been indirectly
      discriminated against without adequate reasons  being  given  for  the
      findings.


  13. As noted, the notice of hearing including directions set  out  in  the
      attached notice, was sent to the claimant at  his  address  in  Dubai.
      There has however been no response to the notice.


  14. At the hearing on 3rd July 2014, Mr Tufan  submitted  that  the  Judge
      "has simply surmised" that the  refusal  was  due  to  the  claimant's
      Syrian nationality as he had previously been granted leave and had now
      been refused. However, the Judge  failed  to  adequately  reason  that
      assumption. The previous  applications  were  in  different  long-term
      categories (student and post student migrant) and  almost  four  years
      had passed since the last grant of leave in May 2010. Each case is  to
      be determined on its merits. A visit visa cannot be determined on  the
      basis of applications in completely  different  categories  made  some
      years ago.


  15. In allowing the appeal on race relations  grounds  without  specifying
      how he had been discriminated against in accordance with Part  1,  s.1
      of the Race Relations Act 1976, and without having made  any  findings
      on any evidence adduced of the  alleged  discrimination,  amounted  to
      unsubstantiated assertions.  There  had  been  no  suggestion  in  the
      determination that any evidence had  been  adduced  by  the  appellant
      apart from assertions.


  16. Further, there was no reference to the situation in Syria in the ECO's
      refusal notice. The Judge's conclusion was not based on  evidence.  In
      the  absence  of  adequately  reasoned  findings  "the  Judge  had  no
      jurisdiction to hear the appeal."


  17. Further, the Judge failed to make any adequately reasoned findings  in
      relation to the refusal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  in  fact
      accepted that two of the claimed commission payments were not shown on
      the bank statements.


  18. It was also contended that there had been a  procedural  irregularity.
      The appeal had been heard on the papers. The Entry  Clearance  Officer
      had not had the opportunity to comment on the unsubstantiated findings
      on race relations grounds.


     The claimant's case


  19. I have had regard to the claimant's grounds of appeal before the First-
      tier Tribunal as well as the "memorandum of appeal" submitted  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal on 7th November 2013.


  20. The claimant stated by way of background that he applied  for  limited
      leave to enter the UK as a visitor to spend time with friends,  to  do
      shopping and celebrate his birthday.


  21. He had no intention of  staying  in  the  UK,  having  regard  to  the
      circumstances surrounding his previous travels here.  He  referred  to
      his current employment.


  22. The ECO's assertion that he would not be able to afford  the  expenses
      of staying here for ten days was "completely wrong". Proof of  savings
      had already been supplied to the Entry Clearance Officer.


  23. The last time he applied for entry clearance to the UK was three years
      ago. If he had any intention to travel to the UK and  not  return,  he
      would have done this "earlier before in 2012" as his  post-study  work
      visa was still valid. He had also visited the USA about  seven  months
      ago and still has a valid US visa.


  24. The reasons in the refusal letter  are  not  in  accordance  with  the
      rules. Accordingly, "it is concluded" that the Entry Clearance Officer
      took the  decision  based  on  race  discrimination  grounds  and  has
      racially discriminated against the claimant and  "taken  into  account
      the civil war taken (sic) place in Syria  by  considering  the  Syrian
      applicants to be immigration threat  regardless  of  each  applicant's
      personal circumstances." Accordingly it is 'obvious' that he has  been
      treated less favourably by the Entry Clearance Officer  and  there  is
      direct discrimination based on nationality grounds compared  to  other
      people from different nationalities. The situation in Syria  does  not
      affect the judgment of the officer while assessing the documents.


     Assessment


  25. It is common ground that the claimant  was  only  afforded  a  limited
      right of appeal as he had applied as a  general  visitor.  Accordingly
      the Judge had to consider the appeal with regard to the  Human  Rights
      Act as well as the Race Relations Act.


  26. The claimant has asserted that  he  was  treated  less  favourably  on
      nationality grounds and that the situation in Syria has  affected  the
      judgment of the Entry Clearance Officer.


  27. However, it is evident that the Entry Clearance Officer was well aware
      of the facts relating  to  the  claimant's  previous  application  and
      stated that each case must be decided on its individual merits at  the
      date of application.


  28. The Entry Clearance Officer considered in particular the  evidence  of
      his employment as well as earnings per month. It was  noted  that  his
      bank statement showed  deposits  not  commensurate  with  his  claimed
      salary on 16th July 2013 which equated approximately  to  one  month's
      salary being deposited along with his salary.  Although  the  claimant
      had stated that he had received additional income the Entry  Clearance
      Officer was not satisfied that that  was  the  case.  Accordingly  the
      Entry Clearance Officer was unable to ascertain the  origin  of  those
      funds into the account. As a result, he was  not  satisfied  that  his
      circumstances were as set out or that the bank statement presented was
      an accurate reflection of his financial position.


  29. In addition, he claimed to spend �1,342 on living expenses each  month
      leaving him with about �587 of disposable income. His visit was stated
      to cost him personally the amount of �2014, equating  to  almost  four
      times his monthly disposable income. The Entry Clearance  Officer  did
      not find his wish to incur this expenditure to  be  credible.  He  had
      nobody dependent on him. He had no  property,  and  therefore  he  was
      considered to have demonstrated only limited ties to the UAE.  It  was
      noted that at one time he had shown a desire to remain in the UK in  a
      long term category which led the Entry Clearance Officer to doubt that
      a short visit was intended at present.


  30. That was the background relating to the refusal of his application.


  31. Whilst the claimant might have grounds for disagreeing with the merits
      of the ECO's decision,  he  has  given  relevant  and  proper  reasons
      justifying the assertion that the claimant was not  genuinely  seeking
      entry as a visitor or that he intended to leave the UK  on  completion
      of his visit.


  32. The Judge  had  stated  at  paragraph  10  that  the  Entry  Clearance
      Manager's review made  it  clear  that  the  decision  maker  was  not
      satisfied that the appellant had ties to the UAE  where  he  currently
      resides. She also noted that the claimant had not  directly  addressed
      the  point  made  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  relation  to
      commission.   It is evident that the Judge therefore  noted  that  the
      Entry Clearance Officer had raised legitimate questions regarding  his
      financial circumstances in the UAE which had not been addressed in the
      grounds of appeal.


  33. As noted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Omotosho in granting  permission
      to the Entry Clearance Officer to appeal, there was no record  of  any
      evidence being adduced by the claimant to support the  assertion  made
      and  in  particular  the  consideration  of  that  contention  in  the
      determination had been limited by the First-tier Tribunal Judge to one
      paragraph in which  it  was  concluded  that  the  claimant  had  been
      indirectly discriminated against without  adequate  reasons  for  such
      findings.


  34. It has been alleged that in taking the particular immigration decision
      the Entry Clearance Officer has racially  discriminated  against  him.
      The claimant has asserted that he has been treated less favourably  by
      the Entry Clearance Officer based on his nationality compared to other
      people from different nationalities.


  35. In coming to her overall conclusion, the Judge has not given  adequate
      or  appropriate  reasons  to  sustain  that  assumption.  The  earlier
      applications had been in different categories, both student  and  post
      study migrant categories. Further, approximately four years had passed
      since the last grant of leave in May 2010.


  36. The Judge has not specified upon what basis, and  in  accordance  with
      what evidence adduced by  the  claimant,  he  had  been  discriminated
      against in accordance with the Race Relations Act 1976. There  was  no
      evidence adduced by the claimant in support of that  assertion,  which
      accordingly remained unsubstantiated.


  37. It did not necessarily follow that the visa fell to be  determined  on
      the basis of applications regarding  different  categories  made  some
      years ago. The Entry Clearance Officer noted that each case is  to  be
      determined on its merits. Part  of  the  merits  was,  as  noted,  the
      raising of questions  not  deemed  to  be  inappropriate  or  improper
      regarding the appellant's financial circumstances in the UAE.


  38. I find that there was not a  proper  foundation  established  for  the
      inference drawn by the Judge.


  39. For these reasons, I find that there have been errors in law and  that
      the determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  falls  to  be  set
      aside and remade.


  40. I have found that there  was  insufficient  evidence  adduced  by  the
      claimant  to  support  the  assertion  that  he  had  been  unlawfully
      discriminated against in accordance with the Race Relations Act.


  41. I am satisfied that the decision of the Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
      based on proper considerations, particularly regarding the  claimant's
      circumstances in the  UAE.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  took  into
      account that he had been issued  visas  some  three  years  ago  under
      different categories, including as  a  Tier  1  (Post-Study)  Migrant.
      However, the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the origin
      of funds said to be additional income had been shown. Accordingly, his
      bank statement did not present an accurate reflection of his financial
      position. In addition, he had limited ties to the UAE and had  at  one
      time shown a desire to remain in the UK in a long term category.


  42. Even though the appellant might have a  legitimate  disagreement  with
      the reasons for refusal,  and  the  findings  on  the  merits  of  his
      application, I do not  find  that  the  reasons  given  by  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer justify the assertion, inference or assumption  that
      the decision reached constituted  direct  or  indirect  discrimination
      under the Race Relations Act.


  43. I accordingly find that the decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
      was in accordance with the law and the immigration rule applicable.


     Decision


        Having found that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
involved the making      of an error on a point of law, I  set  aside  that
decision and re-make it, dismissing the         claimant's appeal.


     No anonymity order made.
