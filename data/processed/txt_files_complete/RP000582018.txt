For the Appellant:           Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Capel, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent Mr [G] is a national of  Afghanistan  born  on  the  1st
    January 1971.   He is a 'foreign criminal' who has been convicted of  a
    number of offences, including a violent and unprovoked knife assault on
    members of the public. For that reason the Secretary of State seeks  to
    deport him.    Mr [G] submits that he cannot be deported to Afghanistan
    because there is a real risk that he will come to  harm  should  he  be
    returned to that country. In its decision dated the 26th June 2018  the
    First-tier Tribunal accepted that  proposition  and  allowed  Mr  [G]'s
    appeal. The Secretary of State now has  permission  to  appeal  against
    that decision.


    Background and Matters in Issue


 2. Mr [G] arrived in the United Kingdom in 1996 and claimed asylum. He was
    initially granted 'exceptional leave to remain'  and  in  2002  he  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain as a refugee. He had therefore  been
    living lawfully in the United Kingdom for over 20 years  when,  on  the
    11th July 2017, the Secretary  of  State  served  him  with  notice  of
    intention to deport him.  The reasons, in broad summary, were  that  Mr
    [G] had been convicted,  on  the  6th  June  2017,  of  two  counts  of
    wounding/inflicting grievous bodily harm and two counts of  threatening
    with a blade in a public place. He had been sentenced  to  a  composite
    total of 27 months imprisonment and ordered to pay a  victim  surcharge
    of ï¿½170. This was not Mr [G]'s first conviction. In 2001  he  had  been
    sentenced to a community punishment order upon conviction  of  racially
    aggravated assault and actual bodily harm.   The  circumstances  giving
    rise to the latest convictions were that on an  afternoon  in  December
    2016 Mr [G] had emerged onto the street, drunk and in possession  of  a
    knife, from a betting shop. He had come upon a family on their  way  to
    mosque and started abusing and threatening them. He told the father and
    his children that he was going to  'blow  them  up'  and  attacked  the
    father and one of the children with the knife.   The father was stabbed
    in the head, his son in the thigh.


 3.  The  legal  consequences  of  these  offences,  insofar  as  Mr  [G]'s
    immigration status is concerned were as follows:

          i) The 27 month sentence triggered  the  'automatic  deportation'
             provisions in the United Kingdom Borders Act 2007.  Under  s32
             of that Act the Secretary of State must take action to  deport
             any 'foreign criminal' sentenced to  at  least  two  years  in
             prison.


         ii) Such an individual can only resist automatic deportation where
             he or she can establish that one or more of  the  'exceptions'
             set out at section 33(2) of the Border Act 2007 applies. As  I
             note above, it was Mr [G]'s case that he could not be deported
             because this would place the United Kingdom in breach  of  its
             obligations under both Article 3 of the ECHR and  the  Refugee
             Convention.


        iii) As a precursor to taking deportation  action,  therefore,  the
             Secretary of State had first to consider whether Mr [G]  still
             had protection needs. This he  did.  The  Secretary  of  State
             concluded that there had been a durable change in  Afghanistan
             such that Mr  [G]  could  now  be  safely  returned  there.  I
             hereinafter  refer  to  this  decision   as   the   'cessation
             decision'.   As a matter of law, that related only to Mr [G]'s
             status as a recognised refugee.


         iv) The Secretary of State further invoked Article  33(2)  of  the
             Refugee Convention to submit that even if Mr [G]  is  still  a
             refugee he is no longer entitled  to  the  protection  of  the
             Convention, because Mr [G] is a 'serious criminal' as  defined
             at s72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


          v) That section introduces a rebuttable presumption that  Mr  [G]
             has been convicted of a particularly serious crime and that he
             constitutes a danger to the community in the  United  Kingdom.
             It is for Mr [G] to rebut that presumption.


         vi) Should Mr [G] fail to rebut  the  presumption  that  he  is  a
             'serious criminal' he cannot rely on his status as  a  refugee
             to protect him from removal. Nor  can  he  claim  humanitarian
             protection.


        vii) In those circumstances Mr [G]'s only remaining option would be
             to establish  that  he  faced  a  real  risk  of  inhuman  and
             degrading treatment/ serious harm upon return to  Afghanistan,
             such that would place the United  Kingdom  in  breach  of  its
             obligations under Article 3 ECHR.

 4. In its deliberations on these issues the First-tier Tribunal  found  as
    follows. It accepted that Mr [G] is a  serious  criminal  and  that  he
    remains a danger  to  the  community.  As  such  he  is  excluded  from
    protection by Article 33(2) of the Refugee  Convention.   The  Tribunal
    further  accepted  the  Secretary  of   State's   argument   that   the
    circumstances in connection with  which  Mr  [G]  was  granted  refugee
    status in 2002 no longer exist: those were that he was seeking to avoid
    enforced conscription into a Shi'a militia operating in  Kabul  at  the
    height of the war in Afghanistan.    The  Tribunal  was  not,  however,
    prepared to accept that there were  no  longer  any  protection  needs.
    Having regard to an expert report prepared by Dr Antonio Giustozzi, the
    Secretary of State's 'Country Policy and Information Notes' (April 2018
    and August 2017) and the advice obtained from UNHCR in respect  of  the
    cessation decision, the Tribunal found itself  satisfied  that  Mr  [G]
    remained at risk of serious harm on the grounds that  he  is  a  Hazara
    Shi'a from Kabul, inter alia from  Anti-Government  Elements  including
    Islamic  State.    The  appeal  was  therefore  allowed  on  protection
    grounds.  The consequence of that decision, if undisturbed, is that the
    Appellant will have to be granted Discretionary Leave  on  the  grounds
    that his removal from the  United  Kingdom  would  violate  the  United
    Kingdom's obligations under Article 3 ECHR.


    The Secretary of State's Appeal


 5. The grounds are not, with respect, easy to follow, but  before  me  the
    Secretary of State's case was very helpfully distilled  by  Mr  Melvin.
    The Secretary of State's  central  complaint  is  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal materially erred in  departing  from  the  'country  guidance'
    without good reason. In AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT
    118 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held that Kabul is generally safe and  the
    First-tier Tribunal in the instant case failed to give adequate reasons
    why it reached the opposite conclusion. Since the evidence relied  upon
    was all evidence considered in AS,  it is the Secretary of State's case
    that the First-tier Tribunal's conclusion was not one  rationally  open
    to it.  Applying the country guidance, the only rational conclusion was
    that Mr [G] could now return to Kabul in safety. That being  the  case,
    the Secretary of State submits that the Tribunal erred in allowing  the
    appeal with reference to Article 3.


 6. Mr  Melvin  pointed  out  that  the  country  guidance  is  recent  and
    authoritative. He submitted that none of the materials relied  upon  by
    the Tribunal to justify departure from it were in fact of any probative
    value. The UNHCR guidelines were specifically considered in AS, as were
    the CPIN reports. Dr Giustozzi does  not  deal  with  the  position  of
    Hazaras in his report. In essence,  Mr  Melvin  submits,  the  Tribunal
    cherry-picked the evidence.

    Discussion and Findings


 7. Ms Capel's first submission, in response,  was  that  the  case  of  AS
    (Afghanistan) was not in fact on point.   That was a  case  considering
    the internal flight options for Afghanis fleeing to  the  capital  from
    other areas of Afghanistan.  As  such  the  focus  for  the  Tribunal's
    enquiry was whether conditions could be said, in general, to be 'unduly
    harsh'.  The Tribunal  had,  she  conceded,  made  findings  about  the
    general safety of the city in that context. At paragraphs  173  to  185
    the Tribunal considered the risk to an individual  previously  targeted
    by the Taliban in their home area. At paragraph 186 it  discounted  the
    risk of forced recruitment by armed groups, and  at  187  rejected  the
    argument  that  returnees  might  be  targeted  because  they  appeared
    'Westernised'.   From paragraphs 190 to 203 the Tribunal considers  the
    security situation generally.    As Mr Melvin says, those findings were
    that there is not, in general terms, a real risk to civilians in Kabul.
     Ms Capel points out however, that the Tribunal expressly reserved  the
    position in respect of Shi'a Muslims. At its paragraph 95 the  Tribunal
    said this:

         "There was some, albeit limited, evidence before us of wider  risks
         to individuals in Afghanistan but we do not set out the  detail  of
         such potential categories other than to  mention,  for  example  by
         reference  to  the  EASO  Country  of  Origin  Information   Report
         "Afghanistan  -  Individuals  targeted  by  armed  actors  in   the
         conflict" (December 2017), that there is some evidence of  risk  to
         individuals involved  in  education,  healthcare,  journalism,  the
         security forces, government workers and to Shia Muslims".

    (emphasis added). The country guidance does not address the position of
    Hazaras at all, save to acknowledge  a  document  in  the  evidence,  a
    report by Human Rights Watch entitled "Afghanistan's Shia Hazara Suffer
    Latest Atrocity - Insurgents' Increasing Threat to Embattled Minority".
     I agree that to this extent the Secretary of State is mistaken in  his
    assertion  that  AS  (Afghanistan)  was  a  'complete  answer'  to  the
    protection question in this case.


 8. Mr Melvin further submitted that the  Tribunal  erred  in  placing  the
    weight that it did on the evidence from UNHCR.  The grounds rely on the
    commentary of the Tribunal in LP (LTTE area - Tamils - Colombo - risk?)
    Sri Lanka CG [2007] UKAIT 00076  to  the  effect  that  the  protection
    agenda of the UNHCR is not on all fours with the risk assessment  being
    made by the Tribunal in asylum cases;  Mr  Melvin  placed  reliance  on
    paragraph 203 of AS (Afghanistan) and asserted that it was  clear  from
    this that the views of the UNHCR "had not been accepted" by the  UT  in
    that case.


 9. There can be no quarrel with the proposition in LP that  the  remit  of
    the UNHCR is far broader than the parameters of the Refugee  Convention
    or the Qualification Directive.  It was not however the case here  that
    the First-tier Tribunal placed any weight on general assertions made by
    UNHCR about the humanitarian situation in Kabul or the desirability  of
    returning those seeking protection. What the Tribunal had before it was
    a specific response drafted by the UNHCR in response to the  suggestion
    that the Appellant's refugee status  be  cancelled.  It  was  therefore
    entirely relevant to the Tribunal's enquiry.  As to the assertion  that
    the views of UNHCR were "not accepted" in  AS,  this  is  difficult  to
    square with the paragraph cited in the grounds [203]:

         203.     The UNHCR report was very topical  and  up  to  date.   We
             agree with the general submission made by Ms Richards that the
             protection agenda of the UNHCR is a wider one  than  the  mere
             assessment  of  refugee  or  subsidiary   protection   status.
             However, these reports are prepared  by  persons  with  direct
             experience of the core issues involved and thus we accord them
             substantive weight in this case.

10. The Secretary of State's second objection to the  Tribunal's  reasoning
    turned on its interpretation of  Dr  Guistozzi's  evidence.  Mr  Melvin
    questioned how the Tribunal could have placed so  much  reliance  on  a
    report that didn't even address the position  of  Hazaras;  he  further
    submitted that  since  Dr  Guistozzi's  evidence  had  underpinned  the
    findings of the Upper Tribunal in AS that there was no general risk  in
    Kabul, it could not logically be relied upon by the First-tier Tribunal
    to show that there was.


11. The  First-tier  Tribunal  begins  its  assessment  of  Dr  Guistozzi's
    evidence at paragraph 23 of the determination, where it notes his  view
    that the Hazara community no longer face  the  discrimination  that  it
    once did in Afghanistan. It goes on at paragraph 24 to focus on  a  new
    risk identified by Dr Guistozzi, that being the systematic targeting of
    Shi'a Muslims in Kabul by the self-styled 'Islamic State  in  Khorasan'
    (IS-K). Dr Guistozzi sets out, and the determination replicates, a list
    of deadly attacks that took place between July 2016 and April 2018.  He
    writes of a "wave of attacks" in  western  Kabul,  where  most  of  the
    Hazara population are based,  and  that  the  "Islamic  State  campaign
    against the Shi'a community shows no sign of  abating".   It  was  this
    evidence, rather than evidence  about  Hazara  per  se,  that  led  the
    Tribunal to its conclusion. The risk was made out, found the  Tribunal,
    because Mr [G]  is  a  Shi'a  Muslim,  a  group  that  AS  specifically
    recognised to face a higher risk than Sunni Afghans.  The evidence that
    Dr Guistozzi gave about IS-K attacks on  the  Shia  community  did  not
    feature in AS:  I am therefore unable to say that it was irrational for
    the First-tier Tribunal to take it into account.


12. The overall question that the First-tier Tribunal  had  to  address  in
    this appeal was whether the Secretary of State was able to  demonstrate
    that there had been a durable  change  in  Afghanistan  such  that  the
    protection needs of Mr [G] had  diminished  to  a  point  of  no  legal
    significance. In answering that question the Tribunal had regard to his
    specific characteristics, and background evidence  inter  alia  from  a
    recognised expert, the UNHCR and the Secretary of State's own  'Country
    Information and Policy Unit'.  For the reasons set out above  I  cannot
    be satisfied that in reaching that decision the Tribunal  impermissibly
    deviated from the country guidance,  since  AS  expressly  declines  to
    consider the position of Shia Muslims in detail, and makes  no  mention
    at all of Hazaras.   As the extract from AS (above)  demonstrates,  the
    Upper Tribunal has consistently said that the views of the UNHCR are to
    be  afforded  substantial  weight;  similarly  Dr  Guistozzi  has  been
    repeatedly recognised as  a  knowledgeable  and  impartial  expert.  It
    cannot therefore be said that it was irrational or  otherwise  unlawful
    for the Tribunal to take their evidence into account.


13. I am not satisfied that the grounds as argued before me are made out.

    Decision

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.


15. There is no order for anonymity.
