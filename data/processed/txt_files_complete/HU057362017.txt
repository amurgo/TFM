Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the remaking of the decision in the Appellant's appeal  against
    the Respondent's refusal, dated 6  April  2017,  of  his  human  rights
    claim, which in turn had been made on 12 January 2017.

 2. In its barest form, the Respondent  concluded  that  the  Appellant,  a
    Jamaican national, was, by virtue of convictions  accrued,  a  "foreign
    criminal" and should be deported from the United Kingdom. The Appellant
    asserted that his particular  circumstances,  including  primarily  his
    relationship with his four British children but also  that  with  their
    mother, meant that deportation would breach his rights under Article  8
    ECHR ("Article 8").

 3. The appeal had been heard and allowed by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge
    Gurung-Thapa) in a decision  promulgated  on  16  October  2017.  On  a
    challenge to this decision by  the  Respondent,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Finch concluded, in a decision promulgated on 4 February 2019, that the
    First-tier Tribunal materially erred in law.  The  full  error  of  law
    decision is annexed to my remake decision.

 4. In essence, Judge Finch found that the First-tier Tribunal  had  failed
    to direct itself to the applicable legal test when considering the core
    issue of whether it would be "unduly harsh" for the children to  follow
    the Appellant to Jamaica, or for them to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    if he were to be deported (see para. 14-15 of Judge Finch's  decision).
    That test consisted of two elements: first,  that  the  nature  of  the
    parent's offending is not relevant to the substance of  the  assessment
    of undue harshness (paras. 22-23 of KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53,  which
    had been handed down after the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing);  second,
    that the appropriate threshold for the assessment  of  undue  harshness
    was set out by the Upper Tribunal at para.  46  of  MK  (Sierra  Leone)
    [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) and approved by the Supreme Court at para. 27  of
    KO (Nigeria). In Judge's Finch's view, the evidence relied  on  by  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  arguably  fell  short  of  showing  unduly  harsh
    consequences for the Appellant's children, particularly as regards  the
    possibility of separation.

 5. Judge Finch set the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  aside  and
    adjourned the appeal for a de novo resumed hearing before  her  in  due
    course. No other specific directions were issued.

 6. Judge Finch was, in the event,  unable  to  rehear  the  appeal  and  a
    Transfer Order was made by the Principal Resident Judge at Field House.
    In this way, the matter came before me.

The issues in the appeal

 7. There was some discussion at the  outset  of  the  hearing  as  to  the
    precise nature of the rehearing of the appeal. Ms  Isherwood  submitted
    that the First-tier Tribunal's finding that the Appellant was not in  a
    relationship  with  his  children's  mother  (Ms  G)  had  never   been
    challenged and should therefore be  preserved.  Ms  Foot  responded  by
    reference to Judge Finch's decision that the rehearing would be on a de
    novo basis.

 8. I made a ruling that the rehearing of this appeal was indeed  on  a  de
    novo basis. It is true that the specific  finding  referred  to  by  Ms
    Isherwood had not been challenged by way of cross-appeal.  It  is  also
    the case that a judge determining the question of error of law  may  in
    certain circumstances expressly preserve  findings/conclusions  reached
    by the First-tier Tribunal, notwithstanding that its  decision  is  set
    aside on other grounds. However, in the present case, Judge  Finch  was
    clear: under the subheading of "Decision" it is expressly  stated  that
    the appeal was to be heard de novo. No qualification was added,  either
    in the decision itself or by way of additional directions. In  my  view
    there was no basis upon which to go behind the Judge  Finch's  decision
    on the nature of the rehearing of this appeal.

 9. In respect of the material issues which fall to be assessed and decided
    on in this case, the following matters were canvassed at the outset  of
    the hearing before me and neither representative disputed the relevance
    or accuracy of any of them:

           Agreed matters

              i. the Appellant's immigration history;




             ii. the number  and  nature  of  the  Appellant's  convictions,
                 including the conviction for drink driving in 2018  (to  be
                 set out in greater detail, below);




            iii. the Appellant is in fact the father of his four children;




             iv. the Appellant's four children and claimed partner  are  all
                 British citizens;




              v.  the  Appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                 relationship with all four of his children;




             vi. the Appellant has a fifth child in United Kingdom with whom
                 he  has  no  contact.  The  child  plays  no  part  in  the
                 Appellant's appeal;




            vii. the Appellant is a "foreign criminal" for the  purposes  of
                 the Immigration Rules ("the Rules") and section  117C-D  of
                 the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  as
                 amended ("NIAA 2002");




           viii. the Appellant cannot rely on para. 399A  of  the  Rules  or
                 section 117C(4) NIAA 2002 because of his  largely  unlawful
                 status in the United Kingdom.



            Disputed matters

              i. the Respondent does not accept that the Appellant is  in  a
                 genuine and subsisting relationship with Ms G;




             ii. the Respondent does not accept  that  it  would  be  unduly
                 harsh for Ms G and all of the children to go and live  with
                 the Appellant in Jamaica;




            iii. alternatively, the Respondent does not accept that it would
                 be unduly harsh for Ms G and the children to  be  separated
                 from the Appellant should he be deported to Jamaica alone;




             iv. the Respondent does not accept  that  there  are  any  very
                 compelling circumstances over and above those described  in
                 paras. 399(a)-399A of the Rules and  section  117C(5)  NIAA
                 2002.

The relevant legal framework

10. The relevant provisions of part 5 of NIAA 2002 read as follows:

           "117A Application of this Part

           (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is  required  to
           determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

           (a) breaches a person's right to respect for private and  family
           life under Article 8, and

           (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of  the  Human
           Rights Act 1998.

           (2) In considering the public interest question,  the  court  or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

           (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section  117B,
           and

           (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to
           the considerations listed in section 117C.

           (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the
           question of whether an interference with  a  person's  right  to
           respect for private and family life is justified  under  Article
           8(2).

           117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases

           (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in  the
           public interest.

           ...

            (4) Little weight should be given to-

           (a) a private life, or

           (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

           that is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
           the United Kingdom unlawfully.

           (5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established
           by a person at a time when the person's  immigration  status  is
           precarious.

           ...

           117C Article 8: additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
           foreign criminals

           (1) The deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
           interest.

           (2)  The  more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
           criminal, the greater is the public interest in  deportation  of
           the criminal.

           (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C")  who  has  not  been
           sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
           public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception  1  or
           Exception 2 applies.

           ...

           (5) Exception 2 applies where C has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
           relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
           subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child,  and
           the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child  would  be
           unduly harsh.

            ...

           117D Interpretation of this Part

           (1) In this Part-

           "Article 8" means Article 8 of the European Convention on  Human
           Rights;

           "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age of 18 and
           who-

           (a) is a British citizen, or

           (b) has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period  of
           seven years or more;

           "qualifying partner" means a partner who-

           (a) is a British citizen, or

           (b) who is settled in the United Kingdom (within the meaning  of
           the Immigration Act 1971 - see section 33(2A) of that Act).

           (2) In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-

           (a) who is not a British citizen,

           (b) who has been convicted in the United Kingdom of an  offence,
           and

           (c) who-

           (i) has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at  least
           12 months"

           ...

11. The relevant provisions of the Rules provide:

           "Deportation and Article 8

           A398. These Rules apply where:

           (a) a foreign criminal liable to  deportation  claims  that  his
           deportation  would  be  contrary   to   the   United   Kingdom's
           obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

           ....

           398. Where a person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
           contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8  of  the  Human
           Rights Convention, and

           ...

           (b) the deportation of the person from the UK  is  conducive  to
           the public good and in the public  interest  because  they  have
           been convicted of an offence for which they have been  sentenced
           to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12
           months; or

           ...

           the Secretary of State in assessing  that  claim  will  consider
           whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does  not,  the
           public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by  other
           factors where there are very compelling circumstances  over  and
           above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

           399. This  paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
           applies if -

           (a)  the  person  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
           relationship with a child under the age of 18 years  who  is  in
           the UK, and

           (i) the child is a British Citizen; or

           (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least the
           7 years  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the  immigration
           decision; and in either case

           (a) it would be unduly harsh  for  the  child  to  live  in  the
           country to which the person is to be deported; and

           (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in  the  UK
           without the person who is to be deported; or

           (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
           partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled  in
           the UK, and

           (i) the relationship was  formed  at  a  time  when  the  person
           (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their  immigration  status
           was not precarious; and

           (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to  live  in  the
           country to which the  person  is  to  be  deported,  because  of
           compelling circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in
           paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

           (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in the
           UK without the person who is to be deported."

The Respondent's decisions

12. Following the Appellant's conviction in January 2014 and the imposition
    of a custodial sentence of 12 months' for  actual  bodily  harm  and  6
    months' for perverting the course of justice, the Respondent  issued  a
    decision to deport the Appellant pursuant to section 32(5)  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.  That  decision  was  not  of  course  appealable.  A
    deportation order was signed on 6 April 2017.

13. Having subsequently made a human  rights  claim,  the  Respondent  duly
    refused it and provided detailed reasons in support of this decision. I
    summarise those reasons here.

14. Having set out the Appellant's offending  history  and  the  nature  of
    supporting  evidence  submitted  with  the  human  rights  claim,   the
    Respondent goes on to consider the issue of family life  under  Article
    8. As previously mentioned, the Respondent accepts  that  Appellant  is
    the father of four British children all of whom reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom. It is accepted that although the Appellant was not living with
    the children and their mother, he nonetheless had regular contact  with
    them and in light of all the evidence provided, it  was  also  accepted
    that he had a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with them.

15. It is said that all of the children would be able to adapt to  life  in
    Jamaica, that they would be supported  by  both  of  their  parents  in
    undertaking this change, and that it was likely that  they  would  have
    family already in Jamaica who could  provide  additional  support.  The
    children could take up hobbies  and  interests  in  Jamaica  and  could
    maintain contact with any friends  in  United  Kingdom  through  modern
    methods of communication.

16. It is said that the children could be separated from the Appellant were
    he to be deported. It is noted that the children, as British  citizens,
    could benefit from all entitlements afforded to them in  this  country.
    They would remain with their mother, who was their primary  carer.  The
    impact of being separated from the father would not  be  unduly  harsh.
    The children could maintain contact with their  father  through  modern
    methods of communication or even visits to Jamaica.

17. Is not accepted that the Appellant was  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with Ms G. It is noted that in  representations  submitted
    by previous solicitors, it was said that the Appellant was  "separated"
    from Ms G, although this position was  subsequently  altered  when  the
    human rights claim was made. It was noted that the  Appellant  did  not
    live with Ms G and there was inconsistency in the evidence relating  to
    when they allegedly formed their relationship. It is not accepted  that
    the Appellant had been in the United Kingdom lawfully for most  of  his
    life, nor that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    reintegration into Jamaican society.

18. Finally, it was said that there were no very  compelling  circumstances
    in this case. There was insufficient evidence  of  rehabilitation,  the
    Appellant's desire to re-establish his own business in this country was
    not a significant matter, and that any  help  he  provided  to  Ms  G's
    mother did not represent a compelling circumstance.

The evidence before me

19. Having worked through what initially  amounted  to  a  vast  amount  of
    paperwork on file, and with the agreement of both representatives, I am
    basing my decision on the following sources of evidence:

              i. the Respondent's appeal bundle, under cover of letter dated
                 27 June 2017. Amongst numerous other items,  this  includes
                 representations and evidence in support of the  2017  human
                 rights  claim,  evidence  relating   to   the   Appellant's
                 criminality (including a PNC report), and the  Respondent's
                 decision letter;




             ii. the Appellant's appeal bundle from the First-tier  Tribunal
                 hearing (now marked AB1), indexed and paginated A1-F12;




            iii. the  Appellant's  supplementary  bundle  prepared  for  the
                 rehearing in the Upper Tribunal, indexed and paginated  A1-
                 D14 (AB2);




             iv. a letter from Ms G's mother's  GP,  dated  30  April  2019,
                 explaining that she was unable to attend the hearing before
                 me;




              v. oral evidence from the Appellant, Ms G, and Ms J  McN,  the
                 maternal aunt of Ms G.

20. A full note of  the  oral  evidence  is  contained  in  the  record  of
    proceedings. I will refer to relevant aspects  of  this  evidence  when
    setting out my findings of fact, below.

Submissions of the parties

For the Respondent

21.  Ms  Isherwood  relied  on  the  Respondent's  decision   letter.   Her
    overarching submission was that there was nothing in this  case  beyond
    what she described as the  "ordinary"  parent-child  relationship.  She
    submitted  that  there  were  certain  credibility  issues,   including
    inconsistencies as to what family the Appellant has in Jamaica, whether
    he had indeed stopped smoking cannabis a  significant  period  of  time
    ago, and whether he was a good role model for the children in light  of
    his most recent conviction. In addition, the evidence  on  the  claimed
    relationship between the Appellant and was Ms G was  insubstantial.  It
    was noted that the Appellant had not sought to vary his bail conditions
    so that he could live with as Ms G.

22. Ms Isherwood acknowledged that  if,  as  the  Respondent  asserts,  the
    Appellant is not in a genuine and subsisting relationship with Ms G, it
    would be "difficult to argue" that she  and  the  four  children  could
    relocated to Jamaica along with  the  Appellant.  However,  if  such  a
    relationship did exist, it was submitted that the  entire  family  unit
    could move. The Appellant had more family there and he had admitted to.

23. As regards separation of the Appellant from his children, Ms  Isherwood
    submitted that there was no evidence to take the Appellant's  case  out
    of the "normal" category. The children's parents took it  in  turns  to
    take one of the sons to football. There was no clear  evidence  of  any
    neurological or behavioural problems with any of  the  children.  There
    was very little evidence about Ms G's mother's  situation.  Neither  of
    the two social workers' reports indicated any factors over and above  a
    normal parental role exercised by the Appellant. It was said that  some
    of the social workers' conclusions did not  correspond  to  the  school
    reports, which indicated that the two older boys were doing very  well.
    The evidence from the school also showed that support would be provided
    to the younger son in that  setting.  Ms  Isherwood  wondered  why  the
    Appellant's presence in the United Kingdom was vital to the question of
    the children's identity. The  psychiatric  report  from  2017  did  not
    disclose any conditions on the Appellant's part. Finally, Ms  Isherwood
    submitted that the evidence simply did not reach the threshold set  out
    in KO (Nigeria).

For the Appellant

24. Ms Foot relied on her detailed skeleton argument. She asked me to  take
    a  cumulative  view  of  all  relevant  factors,  in   particular   the
    Appellant's role as a good father-figure to his children,  his  ability
    to draw on his own experiences  to  assist  his  two  boys  at  a  very
    important stage in their lives, the credible evidence provided  by  the
    witnesses, and the behavioural difficulties of the younger son.

25. Ms Foot emphasised the Appellant's role in the children's lives, albeit
    that he did not live with them. There was medical evidence relating  to
    Ms G's mother and the Appellant had been residing with her in  part  to
    assist her. It was submitted that the Appellant was in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with Ms G notwithstanding  what  been  said  in
    previous representations in 2016.

26. It was submitted that the whole family unit could not go  and  live  in
    Jamaica. What family the Appellant does have there live in an area that
    has been besotted by violent crime in recent times: I was  referred  to
    country evidence contained in section E of AB1. In addition,  the  four
    British children have spent their entire lives in this country and  the
    two older boys in particular have set down firm roots in this country.

27. In terms of possible separation, Ms Foot submitted that  the  Appellant
    was a role model, particularly to his boys. His  involvement  in  their
    lives amounted to more than assisting them with activities. The  expert
    evidence of the two  independent  social  workers  should  be  afforded
    significant weight when undertaking the best interests  assessment.  Ms
    Foot suggested that there were the following special  features  in  the
    Appellant's case: the fact that all  four  children  were  "mixed-race"
    living in a predominantly white environment; the behaviour and  anxiety
    of the younger son went beyond "normal" teenage matters; and the impact
    that separation would have on the boys and the eldest daughter.

28. In respect of the relevant legal tests to be applied, Ms Foot urged  me
    to treat the unduly harsh threshold with some caution, noting  that  it
    did not require the Appellant to show very compelling circumstances.

29. Finally, it was submitted that if the unduly harsh test were  not  met,
    they were in this case very compelling circumstances. In this regard  I
    was referred to para. 37 of the skeleton argument.

Findings of fact on relevant matters

30. In reaching my findings of fact I have had full regard to  all  of  the
    evidence before me, including that to which no  specific  reference  is
    made. I have also taken into account the Respondent's  stated  position
    in respect  of  certain  issues,  together  with  the  representatives'
    submissions before me.

Factual matters not in dispute:  the  Appellant's  immigration  history  and
offending

31. I find that the Appellant was born in December 1981 and arrived in  the
    United Kingdom on 15 April 2002 with leave to enter  until  29  January
    2003. He subsequently overstayed. I find that at some unknown point  he
    left the United Kingdom and returned  here  on  10  November  2012.  It
    appears as though he was granted limited leave to remain until  10  May
    2013. Following an in-time  extension  application,  I  find  that  the
    Appellant was then granted 30 months' limited leave to remain,  running
    until 16 June 2016. On the passport evidence before me I  am  satisfied
    that the Appellant made visits to Jamaica in November  2014  and  March
    2016.

32. The Appellant's uncontroversial offending history is as follows:

                 5 March 2007: convictions for possession  of  cannabis  and
                 driving offences committed on 13 February 2007.  Fined  �50
                 for driving without due care  and  attention;  no  separate
                 penalty  for  the  other  matters,  with  driving   licence
                 endorsed.

                 2 August 2011:  convicted  of  travelling  on  the  railway
                 without paying a fare and given a �65 fine.

                 9 December 2011: convicted of possession  of  cannabis  and
                 given a �65 fine.

                 12 July 2013: convicted of possession of cannabis and given
                 a �200 fine.

                 3 October 2013: convicted of  possession  of  cannabis  and
                 given a �75 fine.

                 17 December 2013: convicted of possession of  cannabis  and
                 given a �110 fine.

                 24 January 2014: convicted of  assault  occasioning  actual
                 bodily harm and perverting the course of justice. Sentenced
                 to 12 months' imprisonment for the assault and 6 months for
                 the second count, both to run consecutively.

                 21 September 2018: convicted  of  driving  a  vehicle  with
                 excess alcohol. Fined and disqualified from driving for  14
                 months, subject  to  a  reduction  in  the  period  once  a
                 specific course is undertaken.

33. In respect of the so-called "index" offence from 2014, and in light  of
    the sentencing remarks  of  HHJ  Hatton,  dated  24  January  2014  (F1
    Respondent's bundle), I make the following  additional  findings.   The
    Appellant conducted what was described as  a  "sustained  and  serious"
    attack upon a woman with whom he had been having a sexual relationship.
    I find that the Appellant undertook a very nasty  and  what  must  have
    been an extremely frightening attack on the victim,  including  hitting
    her with objects as well as his fists, and making threats to kill.

34. I accept that the Appellant was assessed within the 2015  OASys  report
    as constituting a "low" risk of reoffending and a "low" risk of serious
    harm to the public (C34 and C43 AB1). I  note  that  the  serious  harm
    assessment stated that the risk to children was "high" as was that to a
    known adult  (presumably  the  Appellant's  victim).  The  unchallenged
    psychiatric report from Dr Malhotra,  dated  30  June  2017,  makes  an
    assessment of a "low" risk of violent reoffending (B40-B41 AB1).

35. Whilst I do  play  significant  weight  on  the  OASys  report  and  Dr
    Malhotra's  assessment,  the  fact  that  the  Appellant   subsequently
    reoffended in the  autumn  of  last  year  does,  in  my  view,  go  to
    materially undermine the assessment of low risk. Notwithstanding what I
    accept was genuine contrition as regards the previous offending, in the
    knowledge not only that the Respondent was  taking  deportation  action
    against him but also that he had  an  appeal  hearing  coming  up,  the
    Appellant chose to drive a car having consumed  enough  alcohol  to  be
    over the legal limit. In light of this,  and  in  the  absence  of  any
    subsequent risk assessment,  I  find  as  a  fact  that  the  Appellant
    represents a medium risk of reoffending.

36. I also find that he represents low to medium risk of  serious  harm  to
    the public. Drink-driving is, by its nature, an act  that  creates  the
    very real danger of extremely serious consequences for members  of  the
    public (in addition, of course, to the perpetrator themselves).

37. There is a question concerning the Appellant's use of cannabis over the
    course of time. He told me in oral evidence that he stopped doing  this
    over two years ago. Ms  Isherwood  referred  me  to  para.  43  of  the
    psychiatric report at B20 AB1). The author reported that the  Appellant
    had given up cannabis and was then only using it "occasionally... on  a
    recreational basis". I find that this information could only have  come
    from the Appellant  himself.  It  does  not  sit  well  with  his  oral
    evidence, which was to the effect that  he  stop  using  it  altogether
    prior to the assessment by the psychiatrist. Whilst not suggesting that
    the Appellant had necessarily committed any further  offences  relating
    to cannabis, I do find that he continued to use it  on  a  recreational
    basis at the time of, and  probably  beyond,  his  interview  with  the
    psychiatrist on 2 June 2017. Having said that, I do accept that he  has
    never smoked cannabis in front of the children or Ms G.

Factual  matters  not  in  dispute:  the  Appellant's   children   and   his
relationship with them

38. It is accepted by the Respondent that the Appellant is  the  biological
    father of four children, two older boys and two daughters: R (known  as
    Sh), born in July 2005; J, born in September 2006; S,  born  in  August
    2012; and A, born in June 2014. All of the children of British, and all
    have lived in this country for the entirety of their lives.

39. I find that Sh is currently in Year 9 of secondary school, and will  be
    beginning the GCSE course as of  September  2019.  I  find  that  J  is
    currently in Year 7, S is in Year 1, and A is in Reception class.

40. I find that Sh is very  well-settled  in  his  educational  and  social
    environment. The evidence from his school indicates that he is  a  very
    able student (C14  AB2).  There  is  no  suggestion  that  he  has  any
    developmental or behavioural problems, and I find that he does not.

41. I find that J is a talented footballer and a good deal of his focus  in
    life is directed at that particular pastime. It appears from the school
    report at C13 AB2 that J also a good student.

42. From the evidence before me, I accept that J has had some  difficulties
    in respect of his behaviour. It appears as though at  one  stage  there
    was a referral for an ADHD assessment, but  this  was  later  withdrawn
    (para. 26 at B18 AB1). I do, however, accept the evidence of Ms G  that
    J has been "stressed" at school and this has led  to  some  behavioural
    issues. Her evidence to me was that involvement by the school's Special
    Educational  Needs  Coordinator  is  either  in  place   or   will   be
    forthcoming, is supported by  what  she  told  the  independent  social
    worker recently (B11 AB2). I also accept the oral evidence that  J  has
    exhibited examples of distressed behaviour, including being tearful  at
    school and undressing at a sports event. There is no specific report on
    J in respect of any difficulties, but  in  my  view  that  is  probably
    unsurprising given that assessment appears to be at a very early stage.
    I was told that J might be in  line  to  receive  counselling  from  an
    outside organisation, but in fairness to MsG, she  was  quite  open  in
    admitting that nothing was yet in place.

43. I find that S and A are both settled in school and  the  evidence  from
    that institution indicates that they are both doing well  there.  There
    is no evidence to suggest that  either  of  them  have  any  additional
    challenges, and I find that they do not.

44. Based on Ms G's reliable  evidence,  I  find  that  the  children  have
    visited Jamaica in the past:  she  took  the  two  boys  there  on  one
    occasion and all four children went on the second.

45. I turn now to the nature  of  the  Appellant's  relationship  with  his
    children. The Respondent accepts, as do I, that there is a genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship between the father and  his  children.
    To place this in a rather more detailed context, I make  the  following
    findings.

46. It is difficult to discern  whether  or  not  the  Appellant  has  ever
    actually lived in the same property  as  the  children.  Having  looked
    through the evidence  before  me  with  care,  I  cannot  see  specific
    evidence (whether direct or by way of representations/submissions  made
    on the Appellant's behalf) to indicate that he has. If there  had  been
    any material periods of cohabitation, I  would  have  expected  to  see
    evidence of this in one form or another.

47. On balance, I find that the Appellant has not lived with  his  children
    for any appreciable period of time during the course  of  their  lives,
    although this fact has not of course prevented the  Respondent  and  me
    accepting that he nonetheless has a genuine and subsisting relationship
    with them.

48. I find, as did the Respondent, that the Appellant has had a significant
    input into the lives of his children during the course of their  lives.
    It is clear from the evidence before  me  that  he  has  seen  them  on
    something fairly close to a daily basis. I  accept  that  he  has  been
    heavily involved in practical matters such  as:  the  school  runs,  at
    least in the past; sharing the task of taking J to football activities,
    including those involving fairly long-distance travel;  assisting  with
    homework, were able to do so; cooking; and general assistance with  the
    children's everyday practical needs.

49. I find that Ms G works at S and A's school. From  the  timings  of  her
    hours provided in evidence, I find  that  she  works  at  the  school's
    breakfast  and  after-school  clubs  and  as  a  midday  supervisor  or
    lunchtime assistant. On her oral evidence, the Appellant is  no  longer
    involved in the morning school run as the two girls go with her and the
    boys take themselves to school. It is unlikely that  the  Appellant  is
    required to bring any of the children  back  from  school,  although  I
    accept that he may do so on occasion.

50. I turn now to the equally important matter of the Appellant's emotional
    relationships with his children.  I  play  significant  weight  on  the
    essentially unchallenged expert evidence from the  two  social  workers
    and  the  psychiatrist.  In  many  respects,  this  supports  what  the
    Appellant, Ms G, and Ms McN have said on this issue.

51. The expert evidence from the two social  workers  (in  particular  that
    from Ms Prempeh) makes the following points,  all  of  which  I  attach
    significant weight to:

                    i.  Ms G believes that the Appellant's absence from  the
                       children's lives would be very detrimental  to  their
                       well-being;




                   ii. in the latest social  worker's  report,  Sh  reported
                       that "everything went downhill"  when  the  Appellant
                       was last "away" (when he was in prison);




                  iii. Sh  and  J  are  aware  of  the  possibility  of  the
                       Appellant being  deported  and  displayed  noticeable
                       adverse emotion when discussing this issue  with  the
                       social worker;




                   iv.   the   Appellant's   removal   would   represent   a
                       "significant change of circumstances"  for  all  four
                       children and that this event would  be  perceived  by
                       the two boys as a "significant loss";




                    v. Sh's age and current educational circumstances  leads
                       to the "possibility"  that  the  Appellant's  removal
                       would have an adverse impact on the child's  academic
                       attainment;




                   vi. investigations  surrounding  J's  behavioural  issues
                       makes him "vulnerable";




                  vii. the Appellant's removal would cause Ms  G  additional
                       stress, and this "might" have impact on her parenting
                       capacity;




                 viii.  being   of   dual-heritage   and   residing   in   a
                       predominantly white British community, the absence of
                       the  Appellant  "may"  have   negative   effects   of
                       regarding  children's  cultural  identity  and  self-
                       esteem;




                   ix. separation of children from their father  "may"  have
                       "far-reaching negative consequences" for them all;




                    x.  finally,  that  separation  "is  likely  to  have  a
                       negative  impact  upon  [the  children's]  education,
                       identity, emotional and behavioural development."

52. There is a reference in the latest report  to  the  effect  that  young
    black  boys  need  a  male  role  model  more  than  other  demographic
    categories. I place less  weight  on  this  particular  point  than  in
    respect of those set out  above.  The  assertion  is  not  specifically
    sourced and a degree of caution should be applied to  relatively  wide-
    ranging generalisations. For example, the author  does  not  provide  a
    comparator with, say, young white working  class  boys  or  those  from
    disadvantaged Bangladeshi communities.

53. The combined effect of this evidence is  that  I  find  that  all  four
    children have a strong bond with their father notwithstanding the  fact
    that he has not lived under the same roof as them. That in itself  says
    something about the nature of both parents' commitment to the children.
    In addition, I find that it is more likely than not that  the  children
    would,  purely  from  their  own  perspective,  experience   relatively
    significant negative effects on their wellbeing (both in practical  and
    emotional terms), at least in the short term, if the Appellant were  to
    be removed from their lives. This is likely to be most keenly  felt  by
    the two boys for reasons set out in the expert evidence.

54. Having said that, and whilst placing significant weight on  the  expert
    evidence, it is the case that both social workers couched many of their
    opinions in equivocal terms: "may", "might", "possibly"  and  suchlike.
    That is not a criticism of the authors, but rather  a  comment  on  the
    fact that the expert evidence is only one aspect, albeit  an  important
    one, of the whole picture.

Disputed factual matters: the Appellant relationship with Ms G

55. I  find  that  the  Appellant  is  not  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with this Ms G. My finding is  based  upon  the  following
    matters.

56. I fully appreciate that both the Appellant and  Ms  G  themselves  have
    asserted that they are in a genuine and subsisting relationship. I have
    of course considered this assertion of a relationship in the context of
    the evidence as a whole. The fact that I have rejected this  particular
    aspect of their evidence does not have a material bearing on what  they
    have said about the children and other  matters.  Similarly,  the  fact
    that I have accepted other aspects of their evidence does  not  require
    me to find that the evidence of the relationship is reliable.

57. I do accept  that  the  Appellant  has  in  the  past  been  a  genuine
    relationship with Ms G. I find that  this  relationship  was  certainly
    something more than simply a "casual arrangement".

58. However, aside from the very brief assertions by the Appellant and Ms G
    in their respective witness statements contained in AB1 that they  were
    partners, there is really virtually nothing by way of detail  or  other
    materially  supportive  evidence  to  underpin   the   claim   that   a
    relationship is subsisting. The 2016 social worker's report  does  not,
    as far as I can see, refer to them as being in a  relationship.  It  is
    highly unlikely that such an omission  was  made  in  error.  There  is
    nothing in the latest social  worker's  report  to  indicate  with  any
    clarity that there was a subsisting relationship. Whilst  I  appreciate
    that this report was focused mainly on the  children,  the  absence  of
    clear references to the existence of a relationship is significant.

59. I note that in their latest witness statements, and  despite  the  fact
    that the issue has clearly been a  "live"  one  in  these  proceedings,
    neither the Appellant nor Ms G  provide  any  detail  about  proclaimed
    relationship. Indeed, the Appellant says nothing at all,  whilst  Ms  G
    simply states that "I am the Appellant's partner", without more.

60. There appears to be a brief reference in the psychiatric report to Ms G
    being the Appellant's "partner". However, once  again  this  is  really
    just a passing comment, without there being any further detail  on  the
    issue.

61. I find that the Appellant's living arrangements  are  relevant  to  the
    issue of the claimed relationship. I  accept  that  has  in  fact  been
    residing with Ms G's mother for some time. I also accept that he is  on
    immigration bail. There has been no satisfactory explanation as to  why
    he was not bailed to Ms G's address in the first instance. Even putting
    that to one side, when  asked  why  he  had  not  sought  to  vary  any
    residence condition so that he could live with Ms G and  the  children,
    the Appellant told me that "things had been going on" and  he  had  not
    asked about this possibility. Ms G seemed unaware of the possibility of
    changing address.

62. I have noted the written explanation that the  Appellant  was  residing
    with Ms G's mother in order to help care for her.  However,  this  does
    not sit particularly well with the oral evidence  referred  to  in  the
    previous paragraph and in any event the evidence does not indicate that
    she requires 24-hour care.

63. Taking the evidence as a whole and with due respect  to  the  Appellant
    and Ms G, there is a distinct lack of any  sound  explanation  for  the
    separate living arrangements.

64. In light of the foregoing and on the evidence as a whole, it is  likely
    that the intimate relationship between the Appellant and Ms G ended  at
    the time of, or shortly after, the Appellant's conviction in 2014.

65. Notwithstanding my finding on the intimate relationship,  it  is  quite
    clear that the Appellant and Ms G have maintained very good  links  for
    the benefit of their children.




Disputed factual matters: the Appellant's family in Jamaica, Ms G's  mother,
and relevant family members in the United Kingdom

66. I find that the Appellant has provided unreliable  evidence  about  his
    familial circumstances in Jamaica.

67. In oral evidence he told me that he only had  his  mother,  stepfather,
    and a sister in that country, and that they live in a small property in
    the Montego Bay area. In her evidence, Ms G (whom I found to be a  more
    impressive witness in several respects) quite  candidly  and,  I  find,
    truthfully, stated that the Appellant's mother has two daughters living
    with her, in addition to two nieces and her husband. They all reside in
    an appropriately-sized property. I prefer this evidence to that of  the
    Appellant. I  find  that  the  Appellant  has  deliberately  sought  to
    minimise the extent of his family in Jamaica.

68. I find  that  Ms  G'  mother,  D,  does  suffer  from  various  medical
    conditions.  Although  there  is  something  of  a  dearth  of  medical
    evidence,  I  have  seen  GP  printouts  which  confirm  that  she  has
    rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and a below-knee amputation on  her
    left leg (D40 AB1). It is likely that she does require assistance  with
    certain activities and I accept that the Appellant's  presence  at  her
    home does have a benefit for her. It is likely that  she  needs  to  be
    driven to places and I accept that  Ms  G  undertakes  this  task  when
    required.

69. I accept the evidence that D divorced Ms  G'  father  many  years  ago.
    Having said that, it appears as though he is still available to  assist
    the family when required, something confirmed by the Appellant in  oral
    evidence. I was told that he would be looking after the children on the
    day of the hearing. I infer that he lives relatively close to Ms G.

70. I find that Ms G has a sister, N, with whom there is regular contact. I
    accept that she does suffer from depression and is currently off  work.
    Although this condition can potentially be very  debilitating,  I  find
    that N was looking after her mother on the day of the hearing and  this
    indicates that, at least to an  extent,  she  is  able  to  offer  some
    assistance.

71. I find that Ms G has a brother living in Chester. I accept that he  has
    a young family of his own and that he  does  not  have  a  particularly
    significant role in either caring for D or assisting Ms G herself.

72. Ms McN is clearly a very committed aunt to Ms G and great aunt  to  the
    children. Her evidence shows that she maintains communications with the
    children, sees them on a fairly regular basis, and has a  good  insight
    into difficulties faced by children in general.





Conclusions

The "unduly harsh" assessment

73. I have found that the Appellant's children are all "qualified" in  that
    they are British, and that he has a "genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship" with them.

74. In light of para. 399(a) of the Rules and section  117C(5)  NIAA  2002,
    two questions arise: would it be "unduly  harsh"  on  the  children  to
    follow the Appellant to Jamaica; would it be  "unduly  harsh"  for  the
    children to be separated from their father.

75. In order for the Appellant to succeed in showing  that  his  Article  8
    claim outweighs the very powerful public interest in  his  deportation,
    both questions must be answered in the affirmative.

Self-directions

76. I follow the guidance set out in KO (Nigeria), MK (Sierra  Leone),  and
    RA (s.117C: "unduly harsh"; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT00123
    (IAC) and direct myself as follows:

                   a) the "unduly harsh" test is the same under  the  Rules
                      as it is under section 117C(5) NIAA 2002;

                   b) I  do  not  take  the  relative  seriousness  of  the
                      parent's offending into account when  undertaking  my
                      assessment;

                   c)  the  assessment  requires  an  evaluation   of   the
                      children's "best interests";

                   d) the threshold for undue harshness is  clearly  beyond
                      "reasonableness";

                   e) there must be  shown  a  degree  of  harshness  going
                      beyond that necessarily involved for children  facing
                      the deportation of a parent;

                   f) "Harsh" denotes something "severe"  or  "bleak",  and
                      the addition of the adverb "undue" to the test raises
                      the bar yet further;

                   g) the relevant threshold is clearly high, but  it  does
                      not require "very  compelling  circumstances"  to  be
                      identified;

                   h) the application of the test  will  always  be  highly
                      fact-sensitive.

Question 1: would it be "unduly harsh" for the children to go  and  live  in
Jamaica?

77. In the Respondent's favour, the test is a  high  one  to  satisfy.  The
    Appellant is of course a national of Jamaica and English is the  common
    language. All of the children have at least visited the country in  the
    past. On my findings, the Appellant does have family there and there is
    no reason to suppose that at least some form of support  would  not  be
    forthcoming. The Appellant could be expected to find work of  one  sort
    or another. Jamaica is not a country in  such  a  dire  state  as  many
    others arund the world.

78. Having  said  all  of  that,  there  are  significant  factors  in  the
    Appellant's favour.

79. It is quite apparent to me that the best interests of all four children
    lie strongly in remaining in the United Kingdom. I say  this  in  light
    of: their respective ages  (particularly  those  of  the  boys);  their
    nationality and all  that  brings  with  it;  the  settled  educational
    environment and Sh's imminent progression into  his  GCSE  course;  the
    social and cultural integration that they all clearly have here.

80. I have found that the Appellant is not  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with Ms G. As  Ms  Isherwood  candidly,  and  in  my  view
    appropriately, acknowledged during her submissions, the absence of such
    a relationship would make it diffcult for the Respondent to argue  that
    Ms G (and of course, by extension,  the  children)  could  relocate  to
    Jamaica without it being unduly harsh. Whilst Ms G has, to her  credit,
    ensured that she has a very good relationship with  the  Appellant  for
    the good of the children in this country, it  is  something  altogether
    different to expect her  to  emigrate  to  a  country  with  which  she
    effectively has no ties and without a committed partner.  I  appreciate
    that this factor attaches primarily to Ms G, but it would be artificial
    to consider it of no relevance to the position of  the  children:  they
    would go to live in Jamaica with their mother  and  her  wellbeing  and
    overall circumstances is bound up with theirs.

81. Although Jamaica is not  as  dangerous  or  poverty-stricken  as  other
    countries, it nonetheless suffers from very serious problems  connected
    to crime. The FCO Travel Advice at E1 AB1 and the Respondent's  Country
    Policy and Information Note at E2-E16 AB1 paints  a  bleak  picture  of
    widespread  organised  and  random  criminal  activity.  The   evidence
    indicates that tourists can be a particular target for robbery. I  note
    that a major crime hotspot is Montego Bay, the Appellant's home area. I
    take judicial notice of the fact that there continues to be a state  of
    emergency in that area (as confirmed by current FCO Travel Advice).

82. On the specific facts of this case and with full  appreciation  of  the
    applicable high threshold, I conclude that the cumulative effect of the
    factors in the Appellant's favour go to show that it would  be  "unduly
    harsh" for the children to go and live in Jamaica.

Question 1: would it be "unduly harsh" for  the  children  to  be  separated
from the Appellant?

83. As with almost all deportation cases involving children,  the  question
    of separation is a very difficult one to answer.

84. The first factor I take into account are the children's best interests.
    I assess these as lying strongly in maintaining the current  situation,
    namely the close  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  all  four
    children, with what is effectively daily direct contact.  It  is  clear
    that they love him very much and see him as a very  important  part  of
    their lives. These best interests are a  primary  consideration  and  I
    attach considerable weight to them in my overall assessment.

85. Having their father taken away from them would undoubtedly  cause  very
    considerable upset. On a general level, however, and without seeking to
    sound unnecessarily hard-hearted, such a sense of loss would constitute
    an inevitable consequence of deportation: it would  not  amount  to  an
    unduly harsh impact.

86. Dealing with the children in more detail, I turn first to  Sh.  I  have
    found that he does  not  have  any  specific  challenges  in  terms  of
    behaviour or developmental issues.  He  has  expressed  the  view  that
    things went "downhill" when the Appellant was in prison and there is  a
    real chance that the upset caused by his father's departure would  have
    a negative impact on his studies, at least in the short-term.

87. I balance these matters against the following. Sh  is  clearly  a  very
    able student. With support, in my view there  is  a  strong  likelihood
    that he would be in a position to progress well in his  studies  as  he
    moves into the GCSE course. There is no  reason  to  suggest  that  the
    school and his extremely capable and loving mother would be  unable  to
    offer meaningful support.

88. On my findings, J is in a  more  vulnerable  position  than  his  older
    brother (although the evidence does not support the contention at para.
    12(xiv) of Ms Foot's skeleton argument that he is "highly" vulnerable).
    He has displayed some behavioural problems and this must clearly  be  a
    concern for both him and his parents. I take into  account  the  likely
    fact that the Appellant's removal would have an  additional  impact  on
    him.

89. It is the case that the school appears to be putting in  place  support
    for J and in my judgment this  is  a  strong  indication  that  ongoing
    relevant help with be forthcoming from that quarter  (or  from  outside
    organisations).  In  addition,  Ms  G  would  continue  to  be  a  very
    supportive and involved mother.

90. It is clear that football  is  an  important  part  of  J's  life.  The
    Appellant's absence might have an  impact  on  his  ability  to  travel
    around as much as he has done. Yet  I  cannot  see  that  he  would  be
    prevented from playing any football at all. Whilst being difficult, and
    possibly involving changes to what might be  his  ideal  circumstances,
    arrangements could be made by way  of  Ms  G  transporting  him  and/or
    liaising with other parents.

91. Whilst there has been a less detailed picture of S and A, I have  found
    that neither have any specific educational and/or social difficulties.

92. I have considered the position of the Appellant as a role model to  his
    children. From the perspective of a disinterested bystander, there  are
    in my view significant question marks  about  the  consistency  of  his
    assertion that he is an excellent example on the  one  hand,  with  his
    offending behaviour on the other (all of his  offences  were  committed
    after at least one of the children had been born, and  the  seriousness
    has actually escalated over time).

93. However, the more important point is that the children  see  him  as  a
    role model and it is  their  perspective  with  which  I  am  primarily
    concerned. As with the issue of the understandable upset  caused  by  a
    separation, the loss of a parental role model (of whichever gender)  is
    in reality an expected consequence of the deportation process.

94. There is an additional layer to the role model point  in  this  appeal.
    The children are what is  sometimes  described  as  "mixed-race"  (with
    respect, I would prefer to  use  the  term  "dual-heritage").  It  does
    appear as though they live in a predominantly white locality in Wirral.
    In this context, the potential concern raised by the Appellant and  the
    social workers on the issue of identity is valid  to  the  extent  that
    losing the day-to-day  direct  contact  with  one  half  of  a  child's
    cultural heritage might cause potential difficulties.

95. This concern must be seen in the context of the evidence as a whole and
    what has and has not been said.  I  cannot  detect  a  sense  that  the
    children are unaware of their heritage, or  that  they  currently  hold
    conflicting ideas about their cultural identities. There is no evidence
    to suggest that they have faced specific problems on account  of  their
    mixed parentage and I would give Ms G the credit of being  willing  and
    able to  impart  and  encourage  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the
    Appellant's (and the children's) Jamaican background.

96. The current nature of Ms G' work would in my view allow her to continue
    if the Appellant were deported. She takes the two  girls  with  her  to
    work in the mornings and the boys look  after  themselves.  The  midday
    supervisor role would also be unaffected. In respect of  after  school,
    it could be that the girls stay on at the club and the boys arrive home
    alone. Alternatively, the work pattern might have to change. Although I
    fully recognise that recourse to benefits would never  be  ideal,  this
    would not in  my  view  represent  a  material  contribution  to  undue
    harshness.

97. I have found that the Appellant assists Ms G's mother. In his  absence,
    an additional  burden  would  potentially  fall  on  Ms  G  herself.  A
    mitigation of this could realistically come from one  or  both  of  two
    sources: Ms G' sister and the local authority. I fully appreciate  that
    N suffers  from  depression,  but  she  is  capable  of  offering  some
    assistance, as indicated by the fact that she was with  her  mother  on
    the day of the hearing. Perhaps more importantly, if D's needs required
    it, an assessment would in all likelihood be undertaken  by  the  local
    authority.

98. D's situation effectively precludes her from providing support to Ms G.
    Similarly, N's input would be limited, at least in light of her current
    state of health. I have found that Ms G's father is able  to  help  out
    "when required" (as the Appellant put in in evidence) and it is  likely
    that friends would be willing to assist to some  extent.  Although  she
    lives in London, Ms McN represents both a  source  of  solid  emotional
    support and, when able, practical assistance as well.

99. It is,  however,  fairly  clear  that  extensive  support,  perhaps  on
    something approaching a daily basis, would not be present for Ms G  and
    the children. This is a factor that I attach weight to as favouring the
    Appellant's case. The weight is somewhat reduced by  the  reality  that
    many single parents will not have particularly strong support networks.
    Whilst I am not imposing any exceptionality  test,  difficulties,  even
    fairly significant difficulties,  arising  from  limited  outside  help
    would not, of themselves constitute harsh,  and  certainly  not  unduly
    harsh, consequences.

100. The above-mentioned matters will no doubt be very  testing  for  M  G's
    parenting capabilities. I take into account that fact that she has four
    children. But this is another aspect of the deportation  process  which
    is inevitable. On the facts of this case, I conclude that she would not
    be effectively prevented from continuing to  provide  love  and  strong
    parental support to all of the children.

101. In terms of contact post-deportation, it  is  clear  that  the  use  of
    social media and internet-based video messaging would not be  a  proper
    substitute  for  the  day-to-day  direct  contact  that  the   children
    currently have with the Appellant. The existence of such methods is not
    entirely irrelevant, though. In addition,  the  children  have  visited
    Jamaica twice in the past. I am of course aware that  flights  to  that
    country can be expensive, depending in particular on the time of  year,
    but the history of visits is indicative  of  a  probability  that  this
    could occur in the future.

102. Drawing all of the  above  considerations  together,  I  conclude  that
    whilst a separation of the children from the Appellant would  be  hard,
    indeed harsh, it would not be unduly harsh. In  so  concluding  I  make
    three additional points.

103. First, I am acutely aware of the gravity of my  decision.  Although  it
    will probably come as little comfort, this has been  a  very  difficult
    case to determine.

104. Second, although I have worked through a  number  of  separate  factors
    when assessing the unduly harsh test, I have not  simply  asked  myself
    whether any one of them would be enough to  meet  the  high  threshold.
    Whilst it is clear to me that no single factor is sufficiently  strong,
    my  predominant  approach  has  been  to  consider  all  matters  on  a
    cumulative basis. This involves taking all  the  factors  together  and
    keeping well in mind the existence  of  the  four  children  and  their
    mother and the collective impact that the Appellant's deportation would
    have on them as a unit.

105. Third, I am very conscious that I have reached opposite conclusions  on
    the two limbs of the unduly harsh assessment: in the Appellant's favour
    as regards a relocation to  Jamaica;  against  him  on  the  separation
    issue.

106. In my view, however, there is no inconsistency  here.  My  decision  on
    the relocation issue is based on questions of the  children's  security
    and safety, educational provision, the  rights  and  benefits  accruing
    from being in the country of  their  nationality,  the  maintenance  of
    established friendships, and their mother not having to move to  a  new
    country with someone she is not in a subsisting relationship with. Even
    then, my conclusion that a relocation would by  unduly  harsh  was  not
    reached by a particularly significant margin.

107. My decision on the separation issue has  been  based  on  the  children
    remaining in what is,  fundamentally,  a  safe,  secure,  and  familiar
    environment, together with what I believe to be a careful  analysis  of
    additional general and specific factors relating to  the  children  and
    their surrounding circumstances.

108. With reference to the exceptions set out in the Rules and section  117C
    NIAA 2002, the Appellant's appeal fails.

 "Very compelling circumstances"

109. Finally, I turn to what may be  described  as  the  Appellant's  "fall-
    back" argument, namely that there are in  this  case  "very  compelling
    circumstances over and above" those described  in  the  two  exceptions
    contained in paras. 399(a)-399A of the Rules and  section  117C(4)  and
    (5) NIAA 2002.

Self-directions


110. I direct myself to the approach set out in Hesham Ali  [2016]  UKSC  60
    and other relevant authorities including NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA  Civ
    662 and MS (s.117C(6):  "very  compelling  circumstances")  Philippines
    [2019] UKUT 122 (IAC). The essential principles to be applied are:



                   a) the test is "extremely demanding";




                   b)  matters  covered  by  the  exceptions  can  also  be
                      relevant to the assessment of the test;




                   c) the public interest is very strong indeed;




                   d) that interest retains the facets of  deterrence,  the
                      risk of reoffending, and the public's concern on  the
                      issue of foreign nationals offending  in  the  United
                      Kingdom;




                   e) the particulars of  the  individual's  offending  are
                      relevant;




                   f) the policy of the  Respondent  as  expressed  in  the
                      Rules is deserving of "considerable weight";




                   g) the best interests of  relevant  children  remains  a
                      primary consideration;




                   h) cases are fact-sensitive.

111. The overall approach was summarised in Hesham Ali thus:

                 "The critical issue for  the  tribunal  will  generally  be
                 whether, giving due weight to the strength  of  the  public
                 interest in the deportation of the  offender  in  the  case
                 before it, the Article 8 claim is  sufficiently  strong  to
                 outweigh it. In general, only a claim which is very  strong
                 indeed - very compelling, as it was put in MF (Nigeria) -
                  will succeed."

Factors for the Appellant

112. The best interests  of  the  four  children  lie  very  firmly  in  the
    Appellant remaining with them. As I have concluded  that  it  would  be
    unduly harsh for them to go to Jamaica, the only means  by  which  this
    scenario can occur is if their father  is  permitted  to  stay  in  the
    United Kingdom. I give significant weight to these best interests as  a
    primary consideration.

113. As part and parcel of the first factor,  the  Appellant  has  a  strong
    family life with his children. Further, although I have found  that  he
    is not in a subsisting relationship with Ms G, the two  have  a  strong
    link as parents to their children.

114. The Appellant is a good parent, at least from the  perspective  of  his
    interactions with the children and putting his offending to one side.

115. I place weight on the fact that the  Appellant  will  feel  significant
    upset from being separated from his children.

116. The Appellant has been in the United Kingdom for a considerable  period
    of time now. It follows that he has been away  from  Jamaica  for  many
    years and re-establishment in that country will not be easy.

117. Leaving aside the 2018 conviction for the  moment,  the  Appellant  has
    been assessed by relevant professionals as representing a low  risk  of
    reoffending and a low risk of serious  harm  to  the  public.  I  place
    material weight on this, subject to what I say, below.

118. There is a decent chance that the Appellant would  be  able  to  obtain
    employment if permitted to remain in the United Kingdom.

119. The Appellant has, at least in respect  of  the  pre-2018  convictions,
    shown genuine remorse for his offending. He  had  a  very  good  prison
    record and complied with all aspects of his licence and supervision  by
    the Probation Service. This clearly counts in his favour.

Factors against the Appellant

120. The public interest,  as  expressed  in  primary  legislation  and  the
    Rules, is very powerful. In that sense, the scales are weighted against
    the Appellant from the outset.

121. I have mentioned the issue of reoffending risk as a point counting,  at
    least to an extent, in the Appellant's favour. In the other  direction,
    though, is the simple fact that the  Appellant  went  on  to  commit  a
    further offence in 2018 at a time when the appellate  proceedings  were
    well under way. That rather belies the "low" risk  categorisation  made
    previously. In my view the  subsequent  offending  reduces  the  weight
    attributable to this otherwise favourable factor.

122. I place due weight on the  deterrence  factor  as  being  a  matter  of
    general application. On a  more  specific  level,  it  is  not  without
    significance  that  the  Appellant  himself  was  not   deterred   from
    committing a further  offence  in  2018,  notwithstanding  the  remorse
    expressed previously and the appreciation of the threat of deportation.

123. The same applies to the issue of the public's concern as  to  offending
    by foreign nationals. This point is enhanced by the Appellant's further
    conviction in 2018: a fair-minded member of the public would  be  fully
    justified in holding serious concerns about an individual who committed
    a potentially serious offence even though he (the Appellant) knew  that
    deportation action was pending.

124. As set out in my findings of fact  at  para.  33,  above,  the  "index"
    offence was nasty and in my view, serious. The  Appellant  undertook  a
    sustained attack on a woman with whom  he  had  a  relationship.  Quite
    clearly, the experience for the victim must have been  very  traumatic.
    The primary offence was then compounded by the Appellant's  attempt  to
    coerce the victim after he was charged.  Whilst  bearing  in  mind  the
    actual length of the two consecutive sentences,  I  conclude  that  the
    public interest is rendered stronger  by  the  nature  of  the  "index"
    offence.

125. I  have  concluded  that  the  Appellant  cannot  satisfy  any  of  the
    exceptions contained in the Rules  or  section  117C  NIAA  2002.  This
    inability carries considerable weight against him.

126. There are no material health-related issues in this case.

127. The Appellant's immigration history is relevant to an extent.  Although
    he had limited leave to remain from 2013, prior to that he had been  an
    overstayed in the United Kingdom for many years.

Evaluative judgment on the question of "very compelling circumstances"

128. Having weighed  up  all  the  factors  counting  for  and  against  the
    Appellant, and,  in  respect  of  the  former,  having  done  so  on  a
    cumulative basis, I conclude that he has  not  shown  "very  compelling
    circumstances over and above" those set out in the exceptions contained
    in the Rules and section 117C NIAA 2002, or on any other basis.

129. There is clearly no single factor in his favour that  can  in  any  way
    properly be described as sufficiently powerful to meet  the  very  high
    threshold.

130. On a cumulative view, and taking account of factors  considered  within
    the scope of the exceptions in addition to all others,  the  margin  of
    failure is certainly narrower: I would say that his Article 8 claim  is
    strong. However, it is in my judgment insufficiently so to outweigh the
    numerous significant factors weighing against him on the balance sheet.

131. On a wider Article 8 assessment, the Appellant's appeal fails.

Anonymity

132. I make an anonymity order in this case because of the existence of  the
    four children and the need to protect their identities.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law and that decision has been set aside.

I re-make the decision by dismissing the Appellant's appeal.

                            DECISION AND REASONS







BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.    The Appellant is a national of  Jamaica.  He  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 15 April 2002 and was granted temporary admission  until  29
    January 2003. On 21 January 2003 his application for leave to enter was
    refused but he failed to report, as required on 30 January 2003 as  was
    listed as an absconder. On 20 September 2011 the Appellant applied  for
    leave to remain on human rights grounds but then returned to Jamaica.

2.    The Appellant re-entered the United Kingdom on 10  November  2012  and
    was granted leave to remain until 10 May 2013. He applied  for  further
    leave to remain on 30 April 2013 and on 16 December 2013 he was granted
    leave to remain until 16 June 2016.On 24 January 2014 he was  convicted
    of one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and one count of
    doing an act intended to  pervert  the  course  of  public  justice  at
    Liverpool  Crown  Court  and  sentenced  to  a  total  of   18   months
    imprisonment. As a consequence, he was served with notice  of  decision
    to deport him from the United Kingdom on 22 November 2016. He responded
    to this notice asserting that his deportation would breach  his  family
    and private life rights.

3.    The Respondent refused his human rights claim on  24  March  2017  and
    signed his deportation order on 6 April 2017.  The  Appellant  appealed
    and his appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gurung-Thapa in
    a decision promulgated on 16 October 2017. The Respondent  applied  for
    permission to appeal and his  application  was  refused  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Easterman on 3 November 2017.   The  Respondent  renewed
    his application and Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic granted  him  permission
    to appeal on 2 August 2018. Counsel for the Appellant filed a  Rule  24
    Response, which is dated 20 September 2018.  The error of  law  hearing
    was adjourned on 4 January 2019 as it  had  been  listed  before  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Kekic and counsel for Appellant  successfully  submitted
    that it was inappropriate for the appeal to be heard by the same  judge
    as had granted permission to appeal to the  Respondent.  The  Appellant
    was informed that he did not need to attend this error of law hearing.





ERROR OF LAW HEARING

4.    For the purpose of consistency, I have referred to  the  Secretary  of
    State was the  Respondent  in  my  decision  but  he  is  actually  the
    Appellant for the purposes of this error or law hearing.  Both  counsel
    for the Appellant and the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  made  oral
    submissions and I have referred to the content  of  these  submissions,
    where relevant, in my decision below.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION

5.    Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  sets
    out "additional considerations in cases  involving  foreign  criminals"
    who have submitted that it would amount to a breach of Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights to  deport  them  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  Its sub-sections state:

      "(1)  The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
      (2)   The more serious the offence committed by  a  foreign  criminal,
    the greater is the public     interest in deportation of the criminal.
      (3)   In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
    sentenced to a period of      imprisonment of four years or  more,  the
    public interest requires C's  deportation  unless      Exception  1  or
    Exception 2 applies.
      ...
      (5)   Exception 2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a qualifying     partner, or a genuine and subsisting
    parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the    effect of C's
    deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh".

6.     The  Respondent  accepts  that  the  Appellant  has  a  genuine   and
    subsisting parental relationship with his four British children.

7.    Upper Tribunal  Judge  Kekic  granted  the  Respondent  permission  to
    appeal on two basis. The  first  was  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Gurung-Thapa did not apply the correct test particularly where there is
    a strong public interest in deporting foreign criminals. The second was
    that the Judge had not given reasons for why she found that it would be
    unduly harsh to separate the Appellant from his children.

8.    The basis upon which First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Gurung-Thapa  reached
    her decision is no longer lawful in the light of  the  decision  in  KO
    (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC  53.
    The fundamental test for assessing whether the 'unduly harsh' test  has
    been met has not changed but the emphasis on the role of criminality in
    MM (Uganda) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 617 meant that when First-tier Tribunal Judge Gurung-Thapa  reached
    her decision, she was distracted from the fundamental test by the  need
    to give due weight to the Appellant's criminality. Therefore, she said:

      "I am aware that the issue of undue hardship had  been  considered  by
    the Court of Appeal in MM (Uganda) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 617.  It  was
    held that the phrase "unduly harsh" means the same as in section 117(5)
    as in rule 399. In considering this issue one must consider two factors
    namely (1) the public interest in the removal of foreign criminals  and
    (2) the need for a proportionate assessment of  any  interference  with
    Article 8 rights. It also  held  that  the  more  pressing  the  public
    interest in a foreign criminal's removal, the harder it will be to show
    that the effect on his child or partner will be unduly harsh.  It  also
    held that in  the  present  context  relevant  circumstances  certainly
    include the criminal's immigration and criminal history".

9.    However, in paragraph 22 of KO & others v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2018] UKSC 53, Lord Carnwath found that:

      "Given that exception 1 is self-contained, it would be  surprising  to
    find exception 2 structed in a different way. On its face it  raises  a
    factual issue seen from the point of view  of  the  partner  or  child:
    would the effect of C's deportation be  "unduly  harsh"?  Although  the
    language is perhaps less precise than that of  exception  1,  there  is
    nothing to suggest that the word "unduly" is intended  as  a  reference
    back to the issue of relative seriousness introduced by subsection (2).
    Like exception 1, and the  like  the  test  of  "reasonableness"  under
    section 117B, exception 2 appears self-contained".

10.   Therefore, the first basis upon which permission to appeal  was  given
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic cannot stand in the  light  of  the  more
    recent Supreme Court decision.

11.   However, Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic also gave permission  in  response
    to the second ground of appeal which was that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had failed to identify  the  unduly  harsh  consequences  on  the
    children if the Appellant was deported since it is well-recognised that
    in a  deportation  context  the  splitting  of  families  may  well  be
    proportionate, however contrary to the best interests of  the  children
    that may be. When granting permission Upper Tribunal  Kekic  summarised
    the error as not giving reasons for why she  found  that  it  would  be
    unduly harsh to separate the appellant from his children.

12.   The Home Office Presenting Officer separated the two  issues  out  and
    submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had both  not  appreciated
    the high threshold imposed by the 'unduly harsh' test  and  also  given
    insufficient reasons for showing that this high threshold had been met.
    This was a useful approach as the reasons given by the Judge could only
    be adequate if she had directed herself to the correct test.

13.   However, he also sought to rely upon the case of  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department v AJ (Zimbabwe) [2016] EWCA Civ 1012. This  was
    not appropriate as, although  the  Applicant  in  that  case  had  been
    sentenced to between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment, he  could  not
    benefit from exceptions  arising  from  genuine  relationships  with  a
    partner or child and therefore the 'unduly harsh' test  did  not  apply
    and he had to bring himself within the "very compelling  circumstances"
    category.

14.   Counsel for the  Appellant  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had identified the very  harsh  consequences  that  the  children
    would suffer in paragraphs 47 to 71 of her decision. I accept that  she
    did  rehearse  the  facts  on  which  the  Appellant  relied  in  these
    paragraphs. However, the Supreme Court has now confirmed  in  paragraph
    27 of its decision that the Upper Tribunal gave authoritative  guidance
    as to the meaning of the phrase "unduly harsh" in MK (Sierra  Leone)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC)  where
    it stated in paragraph 46 that:

      "By way of self-direction, we are mindful  that  "unduly  harsh"  does
    not equate with  uncomfortable,  inconvenient,  undesirable  or  merely
    difficult. Rather, it poses a  considerably  more  elevated  threshold.
    "Harsh" in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It is  the
    antithesis of pleasant or comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the
    adverb "unduly" raises an already elevated standard still higher".

15.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not direct herself to this test  and
    it is arguable that the evidence she referred to could  not  meet  this
    high threshold. The closest she came  to  the  test  was  to  note,  in
    paragraph 62 of her decision, that case law indicates  "there  must  be
    relatively few cases  in  which  there  is  a  meaningful  relationship
    between a parent and children where deportation  of  the  parent,  with
    consequent physical separation, will not have an adverse impact on  the
    children".

16.   In her oral submissions, counsel for the Appellant took me to some  of
    the evidence in the bundle but this could not undermine the  fact  that
    the reasons given by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Gurung-Thapa  did  not
    indicate that the accepted test for showing that it  would  be  'unduly
    harsh' had been met.

17.   Counsel of the Appellant also  sought  to  rely  on  the  case  of  VV
    (grounds of appeal) Lithuania [2016] UKUT 00053 (IAC) but this was  not
    of direct relevance as the question in this  case  was  one  where  the
    reasons given had to be considered in the context of the test  approved
    by the Supreme Court.

18.   As a consequence, I find that  the  decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Gurung-Thapa contained arguable and material errors of law.

DECISION

(1)   The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.

(2)      The appeal will  be  heard  de  novo  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
    reserved to myself.
