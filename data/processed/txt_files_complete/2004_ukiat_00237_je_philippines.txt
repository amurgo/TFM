Representation:

For the appellant:           Ms N Adesemowo of Adesemowo, Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr D W Saville, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines who was born on 27  July
      1986.  On 27 March 2002 he made an application for entry clearance for
      settlement as the child of his mother  who  has  indefinite  leave  to
      remain in the United Kingdom and is settled here with her husband, who
      is not the father of the appellant.  On 15 May 2002  that  application
      was refused by the respondent because he was not  satisfied  that  the
      mother, who was his sponsor,  had  had  sole  responsibility  for  his
      upbringing or that there were other serious and compelling  family  or
      other considerations which would make his exclusion  from  the  United
      Kingdom undesirable.

2.    He appealed against that decision and his appeal was heard on 30  June
      2003 by an Adjudicator, Ms J Balloch, who dismissed his appeal on  the
      basis that she was not satisfied that the sponsor had had sole control
      of  his  upbringing  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of   the
      Immigration Rules.   She did not go on  to  make  findings  under  the
      other relevant sub-section of  the  rules  and  for  that  reason  her
      findings would be unsustainable in any event.   But there  is  a  more
      fundamental error which has been made by the  Adjudicator  as  to  the
      scope of the evidential enquiry which  she  is  required  to  make  in
      considering  such  immigration  appeals.   At  paragraph  14  of   her
      determination she says this:

      "In determining this appeal I am  mindful  that  I  am  restricted  to
      taking into account only the facts and information  that  were  before
      the Entry Clearance Officer at the date of the decision".

3.    In that statement she is fundamentally wrong  and  we  wish  to  state
      this quite clearly for the guidance of Adjudicators because it is  not
      the first occasion that the Tribunal has recently seen such an  error.
       The true position is set  out  in  MacDonald's  Immigration  Law  and
      Practice 5th Edition at paragraph 18.78 in the following terms:

           "In order to reach a decision whether or not to allow an  appeal
           under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, Schedule 4, paragraph
           21, Adjudicators can review any determination of a  question  of
           fact on which decision or act was based.   This  means  that  as
           far as questions of fact  are  concerned  Adjudicators  are  not
           confined to  the  evidence  which  was  before  the  Immigration
           Authority when they reached their decision or  took  action  but
           they  can  consider  all  the  evidence  including  any  further
           evidence found since the  decision  was  taken.   In  doing  so,
           Adjudicators and the Tribunal perform a different function  from
           that of the High Court either on judicial review or when dealing
           with statutory appeals  where  the  Court  is  confined  to  the
           material which the Minister or other body had before them.    In
           immigration appeals the Appellate Authority goes into the  facts
           again and can correct factual errors  made  by  the  Immigration
           Authority and hear of facts which were unknown to  the  decision
           maker".  [Our emphasis]

4.    That paragraph contains further useful guidance but the part which  we
      have set out above makes the point which we are anxious to  have  made
      for the benefit of Adjudicators as to the scope of evidence with which
      they are concerned in immigration appeals.

5.    The reference to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 is now of  course
      out of date for those decisions taken on or after 1 April  2003  which
      will be governed by the Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,
      but section 85(5) of that Act preserves the distinction  to  which  we
      have referred above as to the date for consideration of  evidence  and
      the scope of that evidence is as we have set out in the passage  which
      we have quoted.

6.    For the above reasons, this appeal is allowed to the  extent  that  it
      is remitted for hearing afresh before an Adjudicator other than  Ms  J
      Balloch.
