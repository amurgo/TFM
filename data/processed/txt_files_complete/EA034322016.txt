For the Appellant:     Ms R Popal, Counsel, instructed by Amirthan & Suresh
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 27 November 1983 whose
    application for a residence card as an extended family member of an EEA
    national exercising treaty rights was refused on 3 March 2016.  The
    appellant's subsequent appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was heard by
    Judge McCarthy.

 2. In a decision promulgated on 8 February 2017 the judge, applying the
    Upper Tribunal decision in Sala (EFMs) [2016] UKUT 0411, dismissed the
    appeal for want of jurisdiction.

 3. Before me both parties were in agreement that in light of the recent
    Court of Appeal decision Khan v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 it was an error of law to find that
    there was no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. I agree.

 4. As no findings were made by the First-tier Tribunal on the substantive
    issues the matter will need to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal
    to be heard afresh.

Notice of Decision

 1) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
    law and is set aside.

 2) The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard before a
    judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy.

 3) No anonymity direction is made.
