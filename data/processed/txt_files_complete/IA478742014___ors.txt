For the Appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Richardson of Morgan Malik Solicitors




                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.    This  appeal  has  been  brought  by  the  Secretary  of  State.   The
  respondents  are  citizens  of  Pakistan.  Their   appeal   against   the
  appellant's (the Secretary of State) decision refusing to vary  leave  to
  remain  and  to  remove  by  way  of  directions  under  Section  47   of
  Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 was allowed by  Judge  Cohen
  for reasons given  in  the  determination  promulgated  on  3  July  2015
  following a hearing on 18 June 2015 at Taylor House. For what follows  in
  this determination, recitation of relevant facts in not necessary.

2.    At the hearing before me Mr Duffy in his  submissions  invited  me  to
  find that the First Tier Judge Cohen had been misled by  the  appellant's
  reasons for refusal letter and had therefore  allowed  the  appeal  as  a
  consequence. He asked that the appeal be  allowed  and  remitted  to  the
  appellant to enable her to make a decision in accordance with the Law and
  the rules.

3.   Mr Richardson for the respondents agreed with the  submission  made  by
  Mr Duffy and agreed that the relief sought by him was in accord with  the
  relevant case law on Fairness. He cited the case of Mushtaq 2015 UKUT  44
  as well as the principles on fairness set out in decisions in  Naved  and
  Patel.

4.   In the light of agreement by parties and my own view  of  the  relevant
      facts, I allow this appeal of the Secretary of State and direct her to
      make a fresh decision that accords with the Law and rules.
