                         THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR

                             THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia  and
      an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo. He has been given leave to appeal  the
      determination of an  Adjudicator  (Mr  Peter  Clarke)  dismissing  his
      appeal against the Respondent's decision to give  directions  for  his
      removal from the United Kingdom and to refuse asylum.


   2. Mrs R. Manning, of Counsel instructed by Alsters, Solicitors, appeared
      for the Appellant.  Miss G. Walker, a Home Office Presenting  Officer,
      represented the Respondent.  The hearing was conducted by video link.


   3. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 1  September  1999  and
      applied for asylum the same day.  The notice containing  the  decision
      against which he appeals is dated 5 April 2001.  The appeal was  heard
      by an Adjudicator but an appeal against his determination was  allowed
      and following remittal the appeal came before Mr Clarke.  This hearing
      took place on 16 July 2002 and leave  to  appeal  was  granted  on  19
      September 2002.


   4. Procedurally this appeal has had a chequered history.  It is  not  now
      necessary to rehearse the detail because the present position is clear
      and accepted by the representatives for both parties.   The  effective
      date of the Respondent's decision is important.  It is  6  June  2001.
      Whilst the decision is dated 5 April 2001 it is common ground that  it
      was served on the Appellant on 6 June 2001.  The  appeal  against  the
      decision is likely to have been out of time but the  Respondent  takes
      no point on this and accepts there is  a  valid  appeal.   This  is  a
      proper approach in the light of the convoluted history, which may well
      have confused the  Appellant  and  those  representing  him.   As  the
      decision was taken after the Human Rights  Act  came  into  force  the
      Appellant can and has appealed on human rights grounds.


   5. The Appellant claimed to fear persecution from, on the one  hand,  the
      Serbs and the Serbian authorities and on  the  other,  the  KLA.   The
      Adjudicator concluded that, had it been necessary for him to do so, he
      would have found  the  Appellant's  account  of  these  events  to  be
      credible, but it was not necessary.   In  the  light  of  the  country
      information the  Appellant  no  longer  has  a  well-founded  fear  of
      persecution for a Convention reason.  There is no appeal against  this
      part of the determination and the appeal turns on human rights grounds
      under Articles 3 and 8.


   6. The Adjudicator made clear findings of fact in  paragraph  17  of  his
      determination, which we adopt.  These are;


              i. "The Appellant met Amanda Jane Plant ("Amanda"), at a  club
                 in Coventry in May 2000.


             ii. They quickly established  a  relationship,  and  were  soon
                 sleeping together.


            iii. In late August 2000, the Appellant moved in with Amanda.


             iv. In September 2000  the  Appellant  and  Amanda  decided  to
                 become engaged.


              v. On 31 December 2000/1 January 2001 the Appellant and Amanda
                 became engaged.


             vi. On 24 February 2002 the couple  were  married  at  Chilvers
                 Coton church.


            vii. From early May 2001, the couple tried to  start  a  family,
                 and by late June 2001, Amanda was  pregnant,  although  the
                 pregnancy came to an end in about July  2001.   The  reason
                 that Amanda could not attempt to  become  pregnant  earlier
                 was that she was attending a day clinic  for  a  coloscopy,
                 but she was given the "all clear" at the beginning  of  May
                 2001.


           viii. Amanda again became pregnant in October/November 2001,  and
                 their daughter, Elisa Catherine, was born on 4 July 2002.


             ix. The couple lived together a 69  Bermuda  Village,  Uneaton,
                 which is a three bedroom house  and  which  was  previously
                 occupied by Amanda


              x. Amanda works  as  a  sales  coordinator  for  Lynx  Express
                 Management Services Ltd, although she is on maternity leave
                 at present.  Her basic gross salary, before  commission  is
                 �12,750 per annum; and her net income has been about �800 -
                 �1000 per month, depending on commission.  She  intends  to
                 return to work as soon as possible.


             xi. Once Amanda has returned to work, the Appellant  will  look
                 after Elisa Catherine, thus obviating  the  need  for  paid
                 child minding.


            xii. If the Appellant were returned to Kosovo,  and  Amanda  and
                 Elisa Catherine did not go  with  him,  it  would  be  very
                 difficult for Amanda to afford childcare; both her  parents
                 are working, and therefore would not be able  substantially
                 to assist."

   7. The Adjudicator found that in relation to Article 8 and by  reason  of
      Section 77 (4) of the 1999 Act he had to consider the facts  as  at  5
      April 2001. On those facts he concluded that  the  Appellant  did  not
      succeed under Article 8.  However, he went on to set out the facts and
      assess the consequences  as  at  January  2002  because,  and  perhaps
      understandably, there was some suggestion that the effective  date  of
      the Respondent's decision might in fact have been in January 2002.  He
      concluded that if this had been the effective date the Appellant would
      succeed under Article 8 and he would have allowed the appeal.


   8. It now transpires that the correct date is not  either  of  the  dates
      considered by the Adjudicator but, for the reasons we have already set
      out, 6 June 2001.  At first sight this may be a  materially  different
      date from 5 April 2001 because, as the Adjudicator found,  from  early
      May 2001, the couple tried to start a family.


   9. The representatives have not suggested that it is necessary for us  to
      remit to the same or a different  Adjudicator.   The  Adjudicator  has
      made clear findings of fact.  There is no dispute about these  and  in
      the circumstances there is no reason why we should not determine  this
      appeal on its merits.


  10. In relation to Article 3 and as a result of the provisions of  Section
      77 (3) of the 1999 Act we may take into account any evidence which  we
      consider to be  relevant  to  the  appeal,  including  evidence  about
      matters arising after the date on which the decision appealed  against
      was taken.  On all the current facts he has not  established  that  to
      return him would infringe his human rights under Article 3.


  11. In relation to Article 8 we must consider the position at the date  of
      the Respondent's decision on 6 June 2001.  Section 77 (4) of the  1999
      Act so provides, with one concession.  It states,

           "In considering any other ground, the  appellate  authority  may
           take into account any evidence (a) which was  available  to  the
           Secretary of State  at  the  time  when  the  decision  appealed
           against was taken; or (b) which relates to relevant facts as  at
           that date".


  12. We need to consider the effect of the  proviso.   In  Krasniqi  [2002]
      UKIAT 00231 the President said,

           "These provisions are clear.  The ground in issue in  this  case
           is that the decision violates Article 8.  The decision was  made
           in January 2001.  Section 65 makes it clear that the  appeal  is
           against the decision, which states that removal directions  have
           been given for removal at  a  time  and  date  to  be  notified.
           Accordingly,  it  is  necessary  to  have  regard  only  to  the
           situation in January  2001.   There  is  no  way  in  which  the
           provisions can be construed to enable the situation at the  date
           of the hearing of the appeal to  be  considered  and  we  cannot
           rewrite the Act simply because the result is unsatisfactory".

  13. The President went on to approve  Nhundu  and  Chiwera  (01/TH/00613),
      with the exception of paragraph 69. Paragraph 70 of Nhundu and Chiwera
      states,

           "However the exclusionary intent of Section 77  (4)  is  clearly
           not absolute.  Two exceptions are made.  That contained  in  sub
           paragraph 4 (a) does not arise  in  this  case.   The  exception
           contained in subparagraph 4 (b), however,  is  in  broad  terms.
           The wording enables  account  to  be  taken  of  evidence  about
           matters arising after  the  date  of  decision  so  long  as  it
           "relates to relevant facts as at the date".  Whilst these  words
           plainly exclude post decision evidence that is extraneous to the
           issues at stake in the appeal, it does appear to us  to  include
           facts that cast light back upon the situation as at the date  of
           decision.  Thus, for example, in a marriage case in which  there
           was an  issue  concerning  intention  of  the  parties  to  live
           together permanently, the fact that since marriage a couple  had
           lived together would be evidence relating to relevant  facts  at
           the date of  decision.   Read  thus,  the  provision  accurately
           reflected pre-existing  case  law  on  post  decision  facts  in
           immigration cases."


  14.  Paying due heed to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Saad Diriye
      and Osorio, we consider that the provisions  of  section  77  (4)  (b)
      should be interpreted in a way in which, as closely  as  possible  and
      permissable, enables the IAA to take into account  the  facts  at  the
      date of the hearing. The  subsection  does  not,  for  example,  limit
      consideration to relevant  facts  at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's
      decision (whether or not these were available to the  Respondent).  It
      does not limit consideration to contemporaneous evidence  of  relevant
      facts. It admits any evidence, which relates to relevant facts at  the
      date of the Respondent's decision (our emphasis).  "Any  evidence"  is
      widely drawn.  There is no restriction, which states or  implies  that
      "any evidence" is excluded if it demonstrates that the relevant  facts
      at the date of the  Respondent's  decision  have  changed.   It  would
      require a strained and improbable interpretation to conclude that "any
      evidence" could only be accepted if it showed that the relevant  facts
      at the date of the Respondent's decision had not  changed.  The  plain
      and natural interpretation of subsection (b) is that  if  there  is  a
      fact which was relevant and considered or would have been relevant had
      it been considered at the  date  of  the  Respondent's  decision  then
      evidence may be taken into account which shows that it is still a fact
      or, if not, how and to what extent it  has  changed.   This  was  more
      elegantly expressed by the Tribunal  in  the  passage  in  Nhundu  and
      Chiwera to which we have already referred; "Whilst these words plainly
      exclude post decision evidence that is extraneous  to  the  issues  at
      stake in the appeal, it does appear to us to include facts  that  cast
      light back upon the situation as at the date of decision."


  15. We are unable to find any material element of  the  Appellant's  claim
      which was not  a  relevant  fact  at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's
      decision.  There have been material changes in those facts since  then
      but no "new" facts.  Before the date of the decision the Appellant and
      Amanda had met, moved in together, become engaged and tried to start a
      family. All these were relevant facts at the date  of  decision.   The
      subsequent marriage, pregnancy and the birth of  their  child  can  be
      taken into account because they relate to relevant facts at  the  date
      of the decision.


  16. In these circumstances the factual matrix is not very  different  from
      that which led the Adjudicator to say that he would have  allowed  the
      appeal under Article 8.


  17. However, we did not agree with his conclusions.  The Appellant himself
      has not said that his wife or child would suffer in a way which  would
      infringe any of their Article 3 or 8 rights.  He said, as recorded  in
      paragraph 18 (i) of the determination "I do not  think  she  would  be
      treated nicely".  The Adjudicator does not  appear  to  have  had  any
      stronger evidence of  the  difficulties  which  might  face  a  Muslim
      Albanian Kosovan and with a Christian British wife and their child.


  18. The other reasons given by the Adjudicator for what appear to  be  his
      conclusions that there are insurmountable obstacles to  the  Appellant
      returning to Kosovo with his wife and child are set out  in  paragraph
      18 and relate to medical facilities in Kosovo,  particularly  for  the
      Appellant's child. We cannot find any evidence that the Appellant, his
      wife, or child, suffer from any  illness  which  requires  or  may  in
      future require medical treatment.  The Adjudicator's  findings  appear
      to turn on the quality of medical services which the couple and  their
      child may require at some time in the  future.   The  CIPU  report  of
      April 2002, to which he refers in paragraph 18,  indicates  that  "the
      health services are capable of providing satisfactory primary care and
      are improving".


  19. The Appellant's wife may not wish to go to Kosovo with her husband and
      child but, on all the evidence, there is no insurmountable obstacle to
      their doing so.  In reaching this conclusion we take into account  the
      judgment of the Court of Appeal in  Mahmood  [2001]  IAR  229  and  in
      particular the passages quoted at paragraph 7 of the determination. If
      the Appellant's wife chooses not to accompany him he  can  return  and
      make  a  marriage  application.   It  is  not  the  function  of   the
      Adjudicator  or  the  Tribunal  to  try  and  guess  whether  such  an
      application will be successful.  In  any  event  this  should  not  be
      material.  If an application is likely to fail on its merits then this
      cannot be a good reason for circumventing  the  anticipated  decision,
      which would, in the words of Laws LJ, "be manifestly unfair  to  other
      would-be entrants".


       20. On the evidence to return  the  Appellant  to  Kosovo,  with  or
           without his wife and child, would not infringe the high  Article
           3 threshold.


  21. The Appellant has established that he has a private and family life in
      the United Kingdom with his wife and child.  To return him  to  Kosovo
      would interfere with these rights.  We find that to return  him  would
      be in accordance with the law and pursuant to a  legitimate  aim.  The
      reasons are relevant and sufficient.   Taking  into  account  all  the
      relevant circumstances (Bequiri [2002] UKIAT 00725)  the  interference
      is proportionate to the aim.


  22. For these reasons we dismiss this appeal.
