                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Herwald, promulgated on 30th May 2018,  following  a  hearing  at
    Manchester on  30th  April  2018.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted permission, to appeal  before
    this Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant's Claim

 2. The essence of the Appellant's claim, who was born on 26th August 1973,
    is a citizen of Venezuela, and is a male, is that he  has  applied  for
    entry clearance for leave to enter the UK as  a  spouse  of  a  British
    citizen, [DB].  It was accepted that the  Respondent  was  genuine  and
    subsisting.  However, it was not accepted that the  Appellant  met  the
    suitability requirements of Appendix FM,  and  the  Appellant  conceded
    that this was indeed the case, because he could not show that his  wife
    was  in  receipt  of  gross  annual  income  of  ï¿½18,600  in  the  year
    immediately prior to the application date.  What was being asserted  on
    his behalf, however, was that although he could not succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules, his appeal should be  allowed  under  the  aegis  of
    Article 8.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge held that the Appellant could  properly  seek  relocation  to
    Venezuela because his position would not be  any  different  from  many
    Venezuelans on a day-to-day basis (see paragraph  29),  such  that  the
    decision against him would not be  disproportionate.   The  judge  also
    stated that the Sponsor had returned back to Venezuela to be  with  her
    husband for five or six weeks at a time (paragraph 29) and there was no
    reason why she could not do so, and live with her husband there.

The Grant of Permission

 4. Permission to appeal was granted in this matter on the basis  that  the
    judge had failed to consider all the relevant evidence,  in  particular
    the  fact  that  the  Sponsor,  [DB],  was  a  person  who  had  caring
    responsibilities for her sister, such that she  could  not  leave  this
    country to go and live with her husband in Venezuela.   The  judge  had
    failed to give this matter adequate consideration.  Moreover, the judge
    had applied the wrong test in relation to whether it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for the family life between the Appellant and his sponsoring wife
    to be continued in Venezuela.

Submissions

 5. At the hearing before me, there was a degree of  consensus  between  Mr
    Wood, and Mr McVeety, the Senior Home Office Presenting  Officer,  that
    the judge had erred in law.  This arose for the following reasons.

 6. First, the judge had stated that if the sponsoring wife were to go  and
    live in Venezuela with the  Appellant,  the  fact  that  Venezuela  was
    unstable, was not material because, "that is  no  different  from  what
    many Venezuelans maybe experience at present  on  a  day-to-day  basis"
    (paragraph 29).  However, this was not the  test.   The  test  was  not
    whether the Appellant would not be in any worse a position.   The  test
    was whether relocation for the Sponsor and the Appellant  to  Venezuela
    would be unduly harsh given their particular circumstances.

 7. Second, the judge had stated that the sponsoring wife had  visited  the
    Appellant in Venezuela and stayed for five or  six  weeks  at  a  time.
    However, plainly this was a short period and it cannot be used for  the
    purposes of assessment of proportionality on a long-term  basis,  which
    would require a consideration of relocation on a permanent basis.

 8. Third, the Sponsor had given cogent reasons for why she could not go to
    Venezuela to live with her husband (see paragraph 20 of  the  Sponsor's
    witness statement) stating that she was caring for  her  sister,  [CP],
    who had cancer, and the Sponsor actually provided both care for her and
    her children, as she had two sons,  and  this  issue  was  specifically
    raised at paragraphs 15 and 18 of the  Appellant's  skeleton  argument,
    but the judge failed to give it proper consideration.

 9. It was agreed that I should make a finding of an error of law and allow
    the appeal.

Error of Law

10. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside and  remake  the  decision.   I  set
    aside the decision for the reasons given above.  Both  parties  are  in
    agreement in this respect.

Remaking the Decision

11. I have remade the decision on the basis  of  the  evidence  before  the
    judge above, the decision made by him, and the submissions that I  have
    heard today.  I am allowing this  appeal  for  the  reasons  that  have
    already been given under Article 8 ECHR.

12. No anonymity direction is made.

13. This appeal is allowed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I make a fee award of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
