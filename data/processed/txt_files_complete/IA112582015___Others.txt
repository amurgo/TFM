Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr B Singh, instructed by Immigration Advice Service
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are nationals of Sierra Leone.  This is the remaking  of
    the decision on their appeal against the  respondent's  decision  of  4
    March 2015 refusing applications for variation of leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom.  The appeal against that decision  was  allowed  by
    the judge in a decision promulgated on 6 January 2015, but subsequently
    on 29 July 2016 following a hearing of the  respondent's  challenge  to
    that decision, Mr Justice Warby and  I  found  errors  of  law  in  the
    judge's decision and that the matter was to be  reheard  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal as it now has been.

2.   The essence of the appellants' claim is that as the wife  and  children
    of Mr Joseph Saad Michael, who is a British citizen, they came  to  the
    United Kingdom from Sierra Leone because of the outbreak of  the  Ebola
    virus there, and came initially on a visit visa but having  sought  the
    variation referred to above on account of the health crisis  in  Sierra
    Leone.

3.   There is a fresh bundle  for  the  hearing  with  statements  from  the
    sponsor Mr Michael and also the second appellant,  who  is  the  oldest
    child of the couple.

4.   In his statement Mr Michael refers to  the  good  business  he  had  in
    Sierra Leone, the good schools his children were attending and the fact
    that they lived comfortably now.  He said that as a consequence of  the
    outbreak of the Ebola virus they could not return, his business  ceased
    and there was no means of livelihood.  He has obtained  a  job  in  the
    United Kingdom earning �30,000 a year.  He says that Sierra  Leone  has
    now been declared Ebola free but everything is still  very  slow.   The
    children's school has now resumed and he has to start over  again  with
    his business and life in Sierra Leone is full of uncertainties.  He had
    gone back to Sierra Leone in 2015 to dispose of all their assets with a
    view to settling in the United Kingdom and as of now they do not have a
    home to live in.  He refers to the significant impact on  the  children
    of return including the need to look for accommodation and  the  period
    of time during which they would miss school and the significant  impact
    on them as a family.

5.   The second appellant, Joey Joseph Michael, refers to the fact  that  he
    used to attend an American International School in Freetown  which  was
    the American curriculum and he had had to  struggle  to  fit  into  the
    British curriculum to which he was now well settled.  He had passed his
    GCSEs and is now in the sixth form.  He says that he is involved  in  a
    lot of activities in the United Kingdom and refers to  the  significant
    impact on the family if they had to return.  He refers to the fact that
    he would lose at least four months  of  schooling  time  if  they  were
    required to return.  He is not sure  that  the  American  International
    School had re-opened and even if it were he says there are no available
    classes for his age group.

6.   Mr Norton argued that although the case was clearly one that  commanded
    sympathy,  it  could  not  properly  be  said  that  there  were   very
    significant obstacles to the family integrating into Sierra Leone.  The
    Rules did not provide for the circumstances in which  they  were.   The
    circumstances were  neither  significant  nor  compelling.   The  Rules
    anticipated that they should leave  the  United  Kingdom  and  make  an
    application for entry clearance.  He pointed to the fact that, as could
    be seen from the bank statements provided, for example by reference  to
    the balances in Mr Michael's account of �60,000 to �70,000 they clearly
    had significant funds available.  The evidence was not in dispute.   If
    they wished to settle they had to do so lawfully.

7.   In his submissions Mr Singh made the point  that  the  family  had  not
    chosen to stay but that had  been  a  consequence  of  the  significant
    public health problems in Sierra Leone.  They had been  in  the  United
    Kingdom on visit visas and had made a proper  in  time  application  to
    regularise their stay.  It could be seen from  the  witness  statements
    that there were very significant obstacles to  their  integration  into
    Sierra Leone.  They had no family support there, being from Lebanon and
    having only gone there to set up in business.  The  country  was  still
    recovering from the health crisis.

8.   In the alternative the Tribunal  should  find  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances which warranted consideration outside the Rules.   As  Mr
    Michael  is  British   the   question   was   whether   it   would   be
    disproportionate to separate him from his family or ask  him  to  leave
    the United Kingdom.  Authorities such as  Chikwamba,  Chen  and  Beoku-
    Betts  were  of  relevance.   The  family  met  the  Immigration  Rules
    requirements except the need to be  out  of  the  country  to  make  an
    application.  It would  be  disproportionate  to  ask  them  to  leave,
    particularly bearing in mind the Section  55  considerations.   It  was
    clear from the son's witness statement that his time  here  would  have
    been wasted as he would not  be  able  to  integrate  into  the  Sierra
    Leonean or US system.  Nor would any decision  on  an  entry  clearance
    application be quick especially in a country where  the  infrastructure
    had been shaken by the health problems.  The next child was doing  SATS
    before GCSE year and the youngest child was doing level  3  SATS.   The
    Tribunal was asked to bear in mind what had been said in ZH  (Tanzania)
    in particular by Lord Kerr, that the best course of action  was  for  a
    child's  interests  to  be  taken  into  account  unless   there   were
    countervailing reasons of considerable force.  In this regard there was
    the detrimental effect on  their  education  and  development  and  the
    disruption to studies  affecting  their  progress.   No  countervailing
    reasons of considerable force had been put in by  the  respondent.   It
    had been said that they had sufficient money  so  they  could  make  an
    entry clearance application but that was not in line with Chikwamba  or
    Chen.  Otherwise there was no objection.   They  were  not  seeking  to
    circumvent the  Rules,  they  were  only  making  the  best  of  a  bad
    situation.  The proportionality balance  tipped  in  their  favour,  in
    particular the section 117B factors.  The appeal should be allowed.

9.   I reserved my determination.

10.  The first issue to be considered is whether the appellants can,  as  Mr
    Singh argued, bring themselves within  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE(vi).   This  requires  it  to  be  shown  that  there  are  very
    significant obstacles to their integration into Sierra  Leone.   It  is
    clear from the wording of the test that it is a high one.

11.  I have set out above the  circumstances  of  the  appellants.   Matters
    that were of particular significance at the time of the earlier hearing
    before the First-tier Judge have changed, in that the Ebola  crisis  is
    now over and things are returning to normal in Sierra Leone,  and  Joey
    Joseph Michael has now done his GCSEs and  is  embarking  upon  further
    studies.

12.  Clearly as Mr Norton said, there must be considerable sympathy for  the
    family who through no fault of their own found themselves in the United
    Kingdom when the Ebola outbreak occurred and could not return and  have
    sought to make the  best  of  a  bad  situation.   The  impact  on  the
    children's education with the disruption to their schooling that  would
    be involved in  returning  to  Sierra  Leone  and  going  back  into  a
    different educational system which would no doubt take time  to  adjust
    into, and the consequences of  them  no  longer  having  a  home  or  a
    business are not insignificant ones.  But I do not  consider  they  can
    properly be characterised as very significant obstacles to integration.
     The family previously lived in Sierra Leone for some time, Mr  Michael
    was able to establish and build up a  successful  business  there,  and
    they have significant savings.  No doubt there  would  be,  as  I  say,
    difficulties in adjusting back to the Sierra Leone  school  system,  in
    finding accommodation and developing another business, but  these  even
    if they could be described as obstacles of significance, they cannot be
    described as very significant obstacles.   They  are  difficulties  but
    they are not difficulties at a high or very  high  level.   Accordingly
    the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(vi) are not met.

13.  One of the reasons why an  error  of  law  was  found  in  the  earlier
    decision of the  First-tier  Judge  was  that  he  had  not  identified
    compelling circumstances justifying an assessment outside the Rules, as
    required by SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

14.  I do not think it can properly be said that  such  circumstances  exist
    in this case.  The Rules in this regard do  not  represent  a  complete
    code, and, reading across what was said recently by the  Supreme  Court
    in  Ali  [2016]  UKSC  60,  I  must   make   my   own   assessment   of
    proportionality, attaching significant weight to the rules made by  the
    Secretary of State and approved  by  Parliament.   I  consider  however
    that an evaluation of the   case  outside  the  Rules  would  not  take
    matters materially further than the assessment within the  Rules.   The
    circumstances  are  as  set  out  above,   maintenance   of   effective
    immigration controls is in the public interest  and,  though  s.117B(2)
    and (3) are met, the private life established by the appellants has  at
    all times been established at a time when their immigration  status  is
    precarious, and this  forms  a  weighty  part  of  the  proportionality
    balance and can not be said to be outweighed by the factors  militating
    in the family's favour.

15.  Accordingly these appeals are dismissed.
