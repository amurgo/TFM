Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble,     Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    absent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Gillespie,  promulgated  on  4  April
2016, which allowed the Appellant's appeal.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 19 November 1985 and is a national of Poland.

4. On 27 September 2015  the  respondent  refused  to  grant  the  appellant
admission  to  the  UK  under  regulation  19  of  the   Immigration   (EEA)
Regulations 2006.

The Judge's Decision

5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Gillespie ("the Judge") allowed the appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision.

6. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 1 September 2016 Judge  Hollingworth
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

      1. An arguable error of law has arisen in relation to  the  extent  of
      the analysis set out by the Judge in attributing weight to the factors
      relating to the appellant's offending, set against the  background  of
      the chronology, that which the appellant had been told by his  victim,
      the reference by the appellant himself in a letter  dated  17  October
      2015 referred to by  the  Judge  at  paragraph  11  that  he  was  not
      convicted of rape, "but only sexual contact with a  15-year-old  girl"
      in the absence of any specific reference to assessment of risk by  the
      court ruling referred to at paragraph 13 of the decision.


      2. The  opening  of  the  court  ruling  specifically  refers  to  the
      appellant through his attitude proving that he deserved a  conditional
      release. The decision to release the appellant on a conditional  basis
      which was an early release was therefore, it appears, based  upon  the
      conduct of the appellant in custody. The court ruling  refers  to  the
      socio-criminal prognosis of the condemned's future being positive.


      3. There is  no  reference  to  any  risk  assessment  using  specific
      criteria in this context which would assist the Judge in applying  the
      criteria in the regulations.

7. The Appellant did not attend the appeal nor was  he  represented  at  the
appeal. I am satisfied that due notice of the appeal  was  served  upon  the
Appellant at the address that was given. In a letter dated  3  October  2016
the appellant's parents wrote to the Upper Tribunal stating that they  would
not be attending the hearing and that the appellant is  not  able  to  enter
the UK and so would not be at the hearing. I  am  therefore  satisfied  that
having been served notice of the hearing and not  attended.  It  is  in  the
interests of justice to proceed with the hearing in the Appellant's  absence
as I am entitled to do by virtue of paragraph 38 of The  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

The Hearing

8. (a) Mr Bramble, for the respondent, moved the grounds of appeal. He  told
me that the Judge's findings are  contained  within  [10]  to  [17]  of  the
decision, and argued that the findings contained there are insufficient  and
inadequate. He told me  that  the  appellant  was  convicted  of  a  serious
offence and has tried to minimise the gravity of the  offence.  He  reminded
me that the appellant has  been  convicted  of  sexual  intercourse  with  a
minor.

(b) Mr Bramble told me that although  the  Judge  makes  findings  that  the
appellant is  remorseful  and  has  served  a  custodial  sentence  for  his
offence, there are no findings in relation  to  rehabilitation  or  risk  of
reoffending.  He  told  me  that  the  Judge  found  that  the   appellant's
apparently conditional release was a factor in the appellant's  favour,  but
no account is taken of the fact that the appellant attempted  to  enter  the
UK just 10 days  after  his  release  from  prison.  He  told  me  that  the
appellant has a  conviction  for  driving  whilst  under  the  influence  of
alcohol in the UK.

(c) Mr Bramble told  me  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  make  sufficient
findings of fact and failed to properly analyse the  evidence.  He  told  me
that analysis of the public interest was crucial, and  that  the  Judge  had
failed to take account of all of the factors set out in regulation 21(5)  of
the 2006 regulations. These, he told me, are all material errors of law.  He
urged me to set the decision aside.

Analysis

9. The respondent's decision was made on the basis of the serious nature  of
the appellant's conviction in Poland, together with a conviction in  the  UK
for driving whilst under the influence of alcohol.

10. The Judge's decision is brief. The Judge finds that when  the  appellant
was 22 years of age, he had sex with a girl who was 14 or 15 years  of  age.
The appellant was convicted in Poland & sentenced to 2� years  imprisonment.
He was released from prison on 17 September 2015.

11. At [14] and [15] of  the  decision,  the  Judge  takes  account  of  the
appellant's parents  health  problems  and  the  appellant's  expression  of
remorse. At [16] the Judge takes account  of  positive  references  provided
for the appellant. What is lacking is an analysis  which  balances  positive
references and expressions of remorse against  the  serious  nature  of  the
offence for which the appellant was imprisoned.

12. In MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641  (IAC),  it  was
held that (i) It was axiomatic that a determination  disclosed  clearly  the
reasons for a tribunal's decision. (ii) If a tribunal  found  oral  evidence
to be implausible, incredible or unreliable or a document  to  be  worth  no
weight whatsoever, it was necessary to say so in the determination  and  for
such findings to be supported by reasons. A bare statement  that  a  witness
was not believed or that a document was afforded no weight was  unlikely  to
satisfy the requirement to give reasons.

13. I have to find that the decision is tainted by a material error  of  law
because inadequate reasons  are  given  for  finding  that  the  appellant's
exclusion from the UK is not justified on the grounds of  public  policy  or
public security. Because I find a material error of law I set  the  decision
aside.

14. Although I set the decision aside there is  sufficient  material  before
me to enable me to substitute my own decision.

15. Regulation 19(1) says

      19.-(1) A person is not entitled to be admitted to the United  Kingdom
      by virtue of regulation 11 if his exclusion is justified on grounds of
      public policy, public security or public  health  in  accordance  with
      regulation 21.

16. Regulation 21(5) states that, where a  relevant  decision  is  taken  on
grounds of public policy  or  public  security  it  shall,  in  addition  to
complying with the preceding paragraphs of  this  regulation,  be  taken  in
accordance with the following principles-


      (a) the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;
      (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct  of
      the person concerned;
      (c) the personal conduct of the  person  concerned  must  represent  a
      genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of  the
      fundamental interests of society;
      (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which  relate
      to considerations of general prevention do not justify the decision;
      (e) a person's previous criminal  convictions  do  not  in  themselves
      justify the decision.

17. The  appellant  was  convicted  in  Poland  of  the  offence  of  sexual
intercourse  with  a  14-year-old  girl.  He  was  sentenced  to  2�   years
imprisonment. The appellant has lived in the UK since 2008. In 2012  he  was
arrested for a road traffic offence. He was found guilty of driving with  an
excess of alcohol. The appellant returned to  Poland  to  serve  his  prison
sentence. On 17 September 2015 he  was  released  from  custody  six  months
early.

18. 10 days later, on 27 September 2015, the appellant  attempted  to  enter
the UK from France. He was refused admission  under  regulation  11  of  the
2006 regulations.

19. Both of the appellant's parents live in the UK. The  appellant's  father
suffered a stroke in 2009.  He  is  ill  and  requires  constant  care.  The
appellant's  mother  suffers  from  depression,  which   is   treated   with
medication, but she has been troubled by thoughts of suicide.

20. The offence to  which  the  appellant  pled  guilty  is  a  particularly
serious offence. Although not libelled as rape, in UK  law  a  person  under
the age of 16 cannot give consent to sexual intercourse. In  RE  (Turkey)  v
SSHD 2008 EWCA Civ 249  the Court of Appeal said that  the  public  interest
dictated that rape was a crime that  caused  much  revulsion  and  in  these
circumstances, only the  most  pressing  compassionate  circumstances  could
outweigh the need to remove.

21. Although the appellant makes an expression of remorse in a letter  dated
17 October 2015, at the same time he tries to minimise his criminality,  and
states

      "......it was not exactly rape but only sexual contact  with  15-year-
old girl"

22. There is no reliable evidence placed before me of either  rehabilitation
or the risk of reoffending.

23. In the face of the appellant's lack of insight into the  nature  of  the
offence, in the absence of reliable  evidence  that  there  is  no  risk  of
reoffending, and given the serious nature of the offence, I  can  only  come
to the conclusion  that  the  respondent's  decision  is  justified  on  the
grounds of public policy. I consider regulation 21(5) & find  that  decision
is proportionate; the decision  is  based  exclusively  on  the  appellant's
personal conduct- and it is reasonable  to  conclude  that  his  established
conduct represent a genuine present and sufficiently serious threat  to  one
of the fundamental interests of society.

24. The appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision  dated  27
September 2015 is dismissed

Decision

The Judge's decision promulgated on 4 April 2016 is tainted  by  a  material
error of law, and I must set it aside.

I substitute my own decision.

I dismiss the appeal against the respondent's decision  dated  27  September
2015.



Signed                                                              Date 18
October 2016
