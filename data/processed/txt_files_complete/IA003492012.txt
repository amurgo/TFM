                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Nicholls  allowing  the  appeal  of  the  respondent
    (hereinafter the claimant) against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse him further leave to remain in the United Kingdom  as  a
    student.

 2. There is no jurisdiction to appeal the decision  complained  of  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The claimant has not been helped by inconsistencies in the Secretary  of
    State's documentation dealing with  his  application  but  the  decision
    complained of is identified correctly as a refusal to grant of leave  to
    remain made by a person who did not have leave when the application  was
    made.  This is not an immigration decision within the meaning of Section
    82(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and  should
    never have been entertained by the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. I have reminded myself of the observations  of  Sedley  LJ  in  Anwar  &
    Another v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2010]  EWCA  Civ
    1275 at paragraph  20  where  the  learned  Lord  Justice  distinguishes
    between  the  constitutive  and  administrative  jurisdictions  of   the
    Tribunal.  This  purported  appeal  is  not  a  matter  of  adjudicative
    jurisdiction. The decision complained of is one that cannot be  appealed
    to the Tribunal.

 5. That said, I wanted to look at the underlying merits of  the  appeal  in
    case I am wrong in the ruling set out above.

 6. The records show that the claimant has been in the United Kingdom  since
    January 2007.  His leave was extended by stages until 6  September  2012
    and there is nothing in the history or the evidence before me to suggest
    that he has been in any way irresponsible during the  currency  of  that
    leave.  The application that led  to  the  challenged  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State was made late.  It was made at the end of September -
    I think the 28th - by which time the claimant's leave  had  lapsed.   He
    gave an explanation for that.  He said that his mind had been distracted
    by reason of a serious  family  illness  involving  his  brother.   More
    details are given in the correspondence and if the explanation is  right
    then only the most hardhearted would  fail  to  have  a  great  deal  of
    sympathy  for  the  claimant  putting  his  family  affairs  before  his
    immigration obligations.

 7. He thought that he had  to  satisfy  the  Rules  that  would  have  been
    applicable to a person making an application with leave  and  in  simple
    terms these required him to have �2,000 in the bank.  He had  that.   He
    produced the necessary information but the application  was  refused  by
    the Secretary of State because the Secretary of State took the  view,  I
    think clearly correctly, that the claimant had addressed his mind to the
    wrong  Rule.   What  he  should  have  been  doing  was  satisfying  the
    requirement of the Rule relevant to a person who did not have leave when
    the application was made.  I have seen evidence suggesting that in fact,
    ironically, the claimant could have complied with that Rule  if  he  had
    appreciated that this was required of him.  There is  a  bank  statement
    that certainly suggests he had more than the �9,000 that was  needed  at
    the relevant time.

 8. The Secretary of State dealt with the application that  was  before  her
    and refused it and it is very hard to  criticise  that  decision.   Only
    real criticisms that can be made of the Secretary of State  are  in  her
    suggesting at some point that the application decision was appealable.

 9. For some reason this difficulty was not  picked  up  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge who not only heard an appeal he should not have heard but
    he allowed it and he allowed it with reference to the flexible  evidence
    policy.  The Secretary of State maintains  that  this  is  a  completely
    wrong approach and although the  appellant  has  been  represented  with
    polite vigour by Mr Syed-Ali I am quite satisfied that the Secretary  of
    State on this occasion is right.  The flexible evidence  policy  is  set
    out in writing and is appended to the  case  of  Rodriguez  (flexibility
    policy) [2013] UKUT 00042 which  makes  it  plain  that  the  policy  is
    intended to, and acts to permit the Secretary of State dealing  with  an
    application in a regime which is designed to be extremely inflexible but
    clear, to show some common decency  when  something  has  gone  slightly
    wrong. The paradigm example is where a document is unexplainably missing
    from a sequence of documents such as one bank statement  in  a  sequence
    not being copied.  The policy gives the Secretary  of  State's  officers
    power in law, through published policy, to make enquiries  to  fill  the
    gap.  I am entirely satisfied that the policy just does not extend to  a
    situation that exists here where  an  applicant  has  made  an  entirely
    inappropriate  application,  albeit  possible  for  very  understandable
    reasons. There is no obligation on the Secretary of State to contact  an
    applicant and say 'Did you mean to make a different  application?'  That
    would be going far too far. Certainly no one has drawn to  my  attention
    which, properly understood, imposes such an obligation on the  Secretary
    of State.

10. It follows therefore that I am quite satisfied  that  if  this  decision
    was appealable then the appeal should have been  dismissed  because  the
    evidential flexibility policy relied on does not have the meaning sought
    by the claimant.

11. The claimant did not raise "human rights". I do  not  make  any  adverse
    comment about that decision.  This is not the sort of  appeal  that  one
    would expect to be allowed on human  rights  grounds  and  it  would  be
    inappropriate and  irresponsible  to  raise  a  ground  that  could  not
    succeed. I make the point that no point was taken so there  is  no  need
    for me to say anything about the appellant's human rights.

12. It follows therefore that I set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and I substitute a decision saying that  the  Tribunal  has  no
    jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.

13. Nothing that I have said  here  stops  the  claimant  making  a  further
    application and if it is in fact the case that he had the money  at  the
    necessary time and made an application late because of family illness as
    he has always alleged, it may be the case where the Secretary  of  State
    will want to take a particular course but that is entirely a matter  for
    her and not something on which I express any view.

14. It follows therefore that I set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  I neither allow nor dismiss the appeal but rather rule  there
    is no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
