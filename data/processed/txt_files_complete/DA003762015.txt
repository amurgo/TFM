Representation:

For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Morocco born  on  17  February  1988  who
    appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Grimmett who, in a determination promulgated  on  24  November
    2015 dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State made on 6 August 2015 to deport him from the  United
    Kingdom under Regulation 19(3)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006.

2.   The judge noted that the appellant had told her  that  he  had  entered
    Britain when he was aged 22 in 2010  without  being  granted  leave  to
    enter.  However on 10 December 2012 he had been issued with a residence
    card as the husband of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.

3.   On 13 January 2015 the appellant had  been  convicted  of  robbery  and
    sentenced on 10 March 2015 to two years' imprisonment  and  ordered  to
    pay a �120 victim surcharge.  The  sentencing  notes  showed  that  the
    appellant and an accomplice had stolen a watch  worth  �15,000  from  a
    drunk foreigner in a planned and skilfully executed distraction robbery
    on a London street after dark.  The sentencing judge had noted that the
    appellant had no previous convictions but considered it appropriate  to
    pass a custodial sentence as the offence was at the top  of  the  lower
    level identified in the sentencing guidelines.

4.   Judge Grimmett set out the provisions of Regulation  21  before  noting
    that it was the appellant's evidence that his Lithuanian wife  had  not
    seen him since before he was sent to prison.  The  appellant  had  also
    said that he had no family in Morocco,  in that he had  been  given  by
    his mother to social services when  he  was  a  baby  and  placed  with
    another Moroccan family who had moved to France when  he  was  12.   He
    believed that they were still in France.  The appellant had  said  that
    he was stupid to commit the offence and now  realised  how  serious  it
    was.

5.   In paragraph 7 onwards the judge set  out  her  decision  and  reasons.
    She noted that she had no OASys Report about the appellant  but  stated
    that it was not in issue that  he  had  married  an  EEA  national  and
    obtained a residence card and that he had produced pay  slips  to  show
    that he had been working in a restaurant for at least six months  prior
    to the offence.  She  said  that  she  was  satisfied  on  hearing  the
    appellant's evidence of the effect of prison  on  him  and  his  desire
    never to return to prison, that he was aware of the seriousness of  the
    offence but she noted from the sentencing remarks that the offence  was
    described  as  a  skilfully  executed  distraction  robbery   and   she
    considered that that did not suggest that that was the first  time  the
    appellant had been involved in such an  incident  although  he  had  no
    previous convictions.  She noted that the appellant had  been  lawfully
    in Britain and was working at the time the offence was committed as was
    his wife and therefore it appeared that the motivation for the  offence
    was merely financial.  She said there was no evidence produced  by  the
    appellant to show that he  had  undergone  any  courses  in  prison  to
    redress his offending or that he was genuinely remorseful and  that  he
    had undergone any rehabilitation to address his offending behaviour.

6.   She said that she was not satisfied  that  he  had  shown  that  he  is
    currently in a relationship with his wife. She had  not  supported  his
    appeal and there was no evidence from anyone else  willing  to  support
    him although he did have a cousin in  Britain.   She  accepted  he  had
    undertaken courses for English  in  prison  stating  that  his  English
    before her was very good.  She stated that  as  he  had  apparently  so
    easily committed the offence in the past she  could  not  be  satisfied
    that he would not do so in the future if he found himself in  financial
    difficulties.  She noted that he had entered Britain illegally and said
    that that behaviour did not show that he was willing to  abide  by  the
    laws of the United Kingdom  despite  his  protestations  to  her.   She
    concluded that she was satisfied that  there  was  a  risk  of  further
    offending against which she  needed  to  balance  the  appellant's  own
    situation in the United Kingdom.  She accepted that he might  not  have
    been in Morocco for a very long time but said he was now an  adult  and
    that he could look after himself and that as he had  managed  to  enter
    Britain and survive for some  time  before  obtaining  the  EEA  family
    membership card it was clear that he could  look  after  himself.   She
    said there was no suggestion that he had any health  issues  and  apart
    from one cousin she was not satisfied that he had shown that he had any
    family in the United  Kingdom  or  had  integrated  here  although  she
    accepted that he had made efforts to learn English.  She accepted  that
    he would have few links with his country of origin having left long ago
    and not having returned since but said that he was in touch with family
    members and therefore would have links  via  them  to  his  country  of
    origin.   It  was  her  conclusion  that  the  public  policy  for  the
    prevention of crime and disorder outweighed any ties that he might have
    with the United Kingdom and that she was satisfied that he  remained  a
    present genuine and serious threat in light  of  a  skilfully  executed
    robbery of  a  stranger  on  the  streets  of  London.   She  therefore
    dismissed the appeal.

7.   The applicant applied for permission in person stating that  the  judge
    was wrong to place weight on the fact there was  no  OASys  Report  and
    that the judge had erred in  stating  that  confirmed  the  appellant's
    right to residency (it did not).  A request  was  made  that  an  OASys
    Report be obtained and the appellant said that  he  was  subject  to  a
    systems failure and should not be penalised for it.  It  was  important
    to realise that someone who was abandoned by their  mother  would  face
    problems in later life.

8.   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Simpson  gave  permission  to  appeal
    stating that the fact that the appellant's wife had  not  attended  the
    hearing was not determinative of their relationship as the marriage had
    not been dissolved  and  that  therefore  the  appellant  was  lawfully
    present in Britain.  It might be the case that  he  had  not  lived  in
    Britain for five years or more and the judge had been  silent  on  that
    point.  The grant  went  on  to  refer  to  the  principles  in  Maslov
    (application no. 1638/03 of 23 June 2008) and that in  the  absence  of
    both pre-sentence report and OASys Reports  it  is  arguable  that  the
    judge was not able to adequately assess  the  risk  of  reoffending  as
    required in Maslov.

9.   The Secretary of State served a  Rule  24  reply  submitting  that  the
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal had  directed  herself  appropriately,
    properly considering the terms of  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006.  The judge had been correct to note that the appellant was not in
    a relationship with his wife who  was not supporting his appeal and the
    judge's  conclusions were entirely open to her on the  evidence  before
    her.  It was pointed out that the appellant had failed  to  demonstrate
    that he had been in Britain in accordance with the Regulations for five
    years and so it was unclear why the First-tier Judge had been  expected
    to consider that.  This was a deportation  under  the  EEA  Regulations
    whereas Maslov was a decision of the European Court of Human Rights and
    therefore was not relevant to this case.

10.  At the hearing of the appeal before me the appellant,  although  it  is
    clear that his English was good, had the services of an interpreter.  I
    confirmed that he had read the determination and  the  application  for
    permission to appeal and asked the interpreter to read to him the  Rule
    24 notice.  I then asked him if there is anything he wished to  add  to
    the grounds of appeal.  He stated that there  was  nothing  further  he
    wished to submit.

11.  Mr Whitwell relied on the Rule 24 statement and stated that  the  judge
    had  properly  considered  the  rights  of  the  appellant  under   the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  From what she had written  it  was
    clear that she found, correctly, that  he  was  only  entitled  to  the
    lowest form of protection under the Regulations and in fact  he  stated
    there was nothing further the judge could have said.

12.  He went on to state that the  central  issue  in  Maslov  was  that  of
    reoffending and this had been an issue which had been addressed by  the
    judge.  He stated in paragraphs 2 and 5 of the determination the  judge
    had taken into account the length of time the appellant  had  lived  in
    Morocco and in Britain, she had noted his nationality and had  properly
    found that he was not  in  a  relationship  with  his  wife.   She  had
    considered his ties to Morocco and in all had properly  considered  the
    "Maslov" test.  He referred to the sentencing remarks and the fact that
    it was stated that the crime was skilfully executed.   He  stated  that
    Judge Grimmett had properly considered  the  relevant  Regulations  and
    with findings that were properly open to her.

13.  In reply the appellant for whom the  submissions  of  Mr  Whitwell  had
    been interpreted stated that he was the victim of the  offences  rather
    than the person who had  committed  them  as  he  was  drunk  when  the
    incident had taken place.  He stated that  he  had  been  arrested  and
    detained  and  had  complied  with  all  relevant  requirements.    His
    relationship with his wife had been good before he  was  detained.   He
    stated that it was the first time that he had been convicted  and  that
    he was ill and depressed.  He produced  various  certificates  to  show
    that  he  had  learned  English  in  prison  and  that  he   also   had
    qualifications  in  hairdressing  and  had  taken  courses  in   victim
    awareness and thinking skills.  He asked for to leave to remain  saying
    that he had been in Europe for fifteen years and that he had no  family
    in Morocco.


Discussion

14.  I consider that the judge did properly weigh up  all  relevant  factors
    taking into account the provisions of Regulations  19  and  21  of  the
    Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006.   She  clearly  found  that  the
    applicant whose marriage, is no longer subsisting did not benefit  from
    anything other than the basic level of protection as he had  not  lived
    in Britain under the Regulations for  a  period  of  five  years.   She
    properly considered whether or not the applicant was still  a  risk  to
    the community and reached a conclusion which was fully open to her that
    he  was.   She  properly  considered  all  relevant   issues   of   the
    proportionality of removal and indeed made  reference  to  the  various
    factors which are set out in the judgment  of  the  European  Court  of
    Human Rights in Maslov.  In all I consider that  her  conclusions  were
    fully open to her and were correct in law.  I find there is no material
    error  of  law  in  the  determination  of  the  judge  and  that   her
    determination shall stand.
