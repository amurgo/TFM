                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge N M K Lawrence (the judge), promulgated on 8 June  2018,
    in which he dismissed the Appellant's appeal against  the  Respondent's
    refusal to issue him with a permanent residence card  under  Regulation
    15 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006. It was
    the Appellant's  case  that  he  had  previously  been  issued  with  a
    residence card in this country, covering the period 1 April 2011  to  1
    April 2016 on the basis that he was an extended family  member  of  his
    brother, a German  national  (the  sponsor).   It  was  said  that  the
    Appellant had been a member of the sponsor's household  throughout  his
    time in the United Kingdom and that this situation subsisted.



The judge's decision

 2. The judge dealt with the case on the Appellant's assertion that he  was
    a member of the sponsor's household [8].  He referred in  his  decision
    to the Court of Appeal's judgment in KG (Sri Lanka) [2008] EWCA Civ  13
    and then appeared to direct himself that the fact of living  under  the
    same roof as an EEA national was not sufficient to bring the  Appellant
    within the ambit of Regulation 8(2) of the Regulations.  At [12] of his
    decision the judge appears to have  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had
    indeed been living with the sponsor but then went on to  conclude  that
    the Appellant could not succeed in his appeal.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 3. The judge's decision was challenged in  fairly  lengthy  grounds.   The
    core point raised therein is that the judge misdirected himself in  law
    as to the meaning of membership of a household.  Permission  to  appeal
    was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge P J M Hollingworth on 1 August
    2018.



The error of law issue

 4. Prior to the hearing the Respondent submitted a Rule 24 notice.  It was
    effectively accepted that the judge had materially erred in law and the
    Appellant's appeal was to be unopposed.

 5. At the hearing before us Mr Clarke, in his customary fair manner, fully
    accepted what the Rule 24 notice said and accepted that the  judge  had
    gone wrong in law.  In our view this concession was entirely justified.
     It was unclear to us what the judge was saying in respect of any self-
    direction on the law.  There were  also  additional  omissions  in  the
    decision, including a failure to make findings on relevant matters  and
    a failure to give reasons for the ultimate conclusions reached.

 6. There are clearly material errors of law in the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal and we set it aside.



Remaking the decision

 7. We canvassed with the representatives as to whether this  matter  could
    be remade on the evidence now before  us.   Both  representatives  were
    agreed that it could, this being on the basis that  the  issue  in  the
    appeal is fairly narrow.  It is accepted that the Appellant had  indeed
    been issued with a residence card running from 1 April 2011 to 1  April
    2016, and this had been on the basis that he  was  an  extended  family
    member of the sponsor.  In respect of  the  application  for  permanent
    residence, the relevant  period  is  therefore  the  currency  of  that
    residence card at a time when, by virtue  of  Regulation  7(3)  of  the
    Regulations, the Appellant  would  have  been  regarded  as  a  "family
    member" of the sponsor.  It was also  agreed  that  the  case  for  the
    Appellant was being put on the basis that he had been a member  of  the
    sponsor's household: financial dependency was not being relied upon.

 8. In light of this Mr Balroop  took  us  through  the  relevant  evidence
    contained in the two bundles from the Appellant and  that  included  in
    the Respondent's bundle.  We were referred to a variety of  sources  of
    documentary evidence  relating  to  the  period  in  question  and  the
    Appellant's residence at the relevant address, including utility bills,
    bank statements, correspondence from HMRC, and  documents  relating  to
    employment (pages 20, 35, 50, 57, 60-62,  and  65  of  the  Appellant's
    bundles and annex F of the Respondent's).  We  were  also  referred  to
    documentary evidence connecting the sponsor to the relevant address.

 9. For his part Mr Clarke identified what in the  end  appeared  to  be  a
    seven-month gap in the documentary evidence running between  July  2013
    and February 2014.  He suggested that it would have been quite possible
    for the Appellant to have obtained  documentary  evidence  relating  to
    this particular period and  that  the  absence  of  such  evidence  was
    material.

10. In reply Mr Balroop suggested that we should be looking at the evidence
    in the round and applying the balance of probabilities.  Any relatively
    short gap was not fatal to the Appellant's case.

11. Having considered the evidence as a whole, specifically the documentary
    evidence referred to us, and applying the balance of probabilities,  we
    find  that  the  Appellant  was  in  fact  residing  with  the  sponsor
    throughout the relevant period, namely 1 April 2011 to 1 April 2016.

12. The documentary evidence  emanates  from  a  variety  of  sources,  the
    reliability of which had not been undermined by anything else before us
    or by way of submissions.  In addition, we give weight to  the  written
    evidence of  both  the  Appellant  and  the  sponsor.   Mr  Clarke  was
    perfectly entitled to point out the evidential gap, and a gap there is,
    between July 2013 and February 2014.  Having regard to the evidence  as
    a whole and applying the balance of probabilities,  we  agree  with  Mr
    Balroop that this does not fatally undermine the Appellant's case.   It
    seems to us extremely  unlikely  that  given  his  overall  residential
    history, the Appellant would have left his brother's  household  for  a
    short period of time for no apparent  reason  and  then  returned  some
    seven months' later.

13. In light of this core finding of fact,  the  Appellant  resided  for  a
    continuous period of five years in accordance with the Regulations and,
    as of 1 April 2016, acquired a permanent  right  of  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom.  There has been no suggestion that  he  has  lost  that
    acquired right at any stage thereafter.

14. In light of the foregoing the Appellant is entitled to be issued with a
    permanent residence card and his appeal is allowed.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained errors of law and  we  set
it aside.

We remake the decision for ourselves and  determine  that  the  Respondent's
decision of 26 September 2016 breaches the Appellant's rights under  the  EU
Treaties.

The Appellant's appeal is therefore allowed.



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  a
full fee award of ï¿½140.00.
