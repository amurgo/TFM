Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms A Vatish, instructed by Malik & Malik
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Krushnakant Akjanbhai Vinzuda, date of birth 31.5.87, is
    a citizen of India.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    McMahon  promulgated  18.11.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against   the
    decisions of the respondent, dated 26.10.12, to refuse his  application
    made on 18.7.12 for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant under the Points Based System (PBS) of the  Immigration  Rules,
    and to remove him from the UK pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration
    Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    28.10.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foudy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    23.1.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 14.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was no material error
    of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as
    to required the determination of Judge McMahon to be set aside.

 6. There is a convoluted history to this appeal which can be summarised as
    follows:

      a) 29.12.10: Application for entry clearance as  a  Tier  4  (General)
         Student;

      b) 12.1.11: Granted leave to enter  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
         Student, expiring 27.5.12;

      c) 28.1.11: Entered the UK with the above leave;

      d) 27.4.12: Home Office notified that  Regent  International  Graduate
         School no longer on the Tier 4 list of sponsors;

      e) 26.5.12: Application for  further  leave  to  remain  in  the  same
         capacity at Westbridge College;

      f) 19.6.12: Home Office letter rejecting the  application  as  invalid
         for want of photographs and payment. It was also pointed  out  that
         the appellant did not have a valid Confirmation of  Acceptance  for
         Studies (CAS). In consequence, the  appellant's  leave  expired  on
         27.5.12 and he has had no lawful presence  in  the  UK  since  that
         date;

      g) 18.7.12: Further Tier 4 (General) Student application;

      h) 26.10.12: Application refused on the basis that the  appellant  did
         not meet the  required  level  of  maintenance,  as  did  not  have
         established presence in the UK, because he had no leave to  remain,
         and thus he required possession of a  total  of  �7,200,  which  he
         failed to demonstrate. Because he did not have leave to  remain  at
         the date of his application he had no right of appeal against  that
         decision;

      i)  8.11.12:  Pre-action  (Judicial  Review)  letter  to  Home  Office
         challenging the refusal decision;

      j) 9.2.13: Home Office response, maintaining refusal;

      k) 20.1.14: Appeal allowed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Telford,  on
         the basis that the Home Office was unable to evidence  the  failure
         to pay the fee for the 26.5.12; the  parties  purporting  to  agree
         that the appeal should be allowed; and the judge finding  that  the
         application attracted a right of appeal;

      l) 6.2.14: Permission granted to the Secretary of State to appeal  the
         decision of Judge Telford, on grounds of validity of appeal;

      m) 11.4.14: Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge French set aside the  decision
         of Judge Telford, noting that  the  question  of  jurisdiction  and
         validity of  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  cannot  be
         conferred by agreement;

      n) 18.11.14: Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  McMahon  that  the
         Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal;

      o) 23.1.15: Grant of permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge
         Foudy, stating:  "The  judge  found  that  the  appellant  had  not
         appealed an earlier appealable  immigration  decision.  Based  upon
         that fact the judge decided that the appeal before him was invalid.
         It is arguable that the first decision was not appealable, contrary
         to the judge's findings. This amounts to an arguable error of law."

 7. With respect to Judge Foudy, the grant of permission makes no sense and
    does not identify an arguable error of law. Whilst Judge McMahon was in
    error in considering that the first decision rejecting the  application
    of 26.5.12 was appealable, that finding was irrelevant to the  decision
    of 26.10.12 refusing the fresh application of 18.7.12. Whether  or  not
    the decision in respect of the first  application  was  appealable,  it
    remains the case that at the date of the second application of 18.7.12,
    the appellant had no leave and thus  could  have  no  right  of  appeal
    against the 26.10.12  refusal  decision.  Judge  McMahon  was  entirely
    correct to conclude that the appellant had no right of appeal and  that
    the Tribunal could not  hear  his  appeal,  whether  on  the  basis  of
    Immigration Rules or outside the Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR.

 8. Further, the application of 26.5.12, a copy of which is with  the  case
    file, was doomed to failure from the outset. Regardless as  to  whether
    photographs were submitted or payment made, the appellant did not  have
    a valid CAS and the part of  the  application  form  requiring  him  to
    provide the CAS number was left blank. Indeed, as  the  19.6.12  letter
    explained he did not acquire a valid CAS until 17.7.12.

 9. It follows that even if there had been a valid application  on  26.5.12
    and even if the letter of 19.6.12 was an immigration decision, which it
    was not, the application would still have been refused  and  inevitably
    any appeal against that decision would have failed.

10. The fact is that the application was not valid, as  the  appellant  did
    not comply with the payment requirement; his bank rejected the  payment
    request. The Immigration & Nationality (Cost Recovery Fees) Regulations
    2011 and the Immigration & Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2011  specify
    that if the fee is not paid the application is  invalid.  Further,  the
    failure to complete the form correctly, citing a valid CAS reference at
    section  K1  also  rendered  the  application  invalid.  The  appellant
    submitted that application prior to obtaining a valid CAS.

11. The appellant does not benefit from  Basnet  (validity  of  application
    -respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC), for the reasons cited at  �12  of
    Judge  French's  error  of  law  decision,  in  particular   that   the
    circumstances in the present case  are  quite  different.  However,  as
    stated above, even if he did have a right of appeal in relation to  his
    May 2012 application  and  the  letter  rejecting  the  application  as
    invalid, both the application and any appeal were doomed to failure. It
    follows that the appellant's leave would still have expired in May 2012
    and he would not  be  in  any  better  position  today  in  seeking  to
    challenge the refusal decision of 26.10.12 in relation to his July 2012
    application.

12. It follows that there can be no appeal against the decision of 26.10.12
    and Judge McMahon was correct to find the Tribunal had no jurisdiction.
     The error  in  relation  to  whether  the  June  2012  letter  was  an
    appealable decision was not material to the outcome of the appeal.

13. Ms Vatish sought to raise article 8 grounds in the error of law hearing
    before me, producing a document which she claimed were the  grounds  of
    application for permission to appeal. They were not. They were in  fact
    the original grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. The  grounds
    of application for permission to appeal did not raise article 8 and  no
    permission has been granted in relation to article 8 issues. The First-
    tier Tribunal Judge could not in any event consider article 8  grounds,
    as he found that there was no valid appeal before the Tribunal.

Conclusions:

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands. There is
                    no valid appeal that could have been considered  by  the
                    First-tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I no fee award.

Reasons: There is no valid appeal.
