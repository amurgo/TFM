Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Blair, Counsel instructed by David Tang & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of  Serbia,  born  in  1980.   She  made  an
    application for leave to remain as a spouse, but that  application  was
    refused in a decision dated 17 September 2015.

 2. Her appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Carroll ("the FtJ") on 30 September 2016, following which she dismissed
    the appeal.  Permission to appeal against her decision was  granted  on
    the basis that the FtJ erred in failing to take into  account  evidence
    of the appellant's husband's earnings, which  evidence  post-dated  the
    respondent's decision but which showed, arguably,  that  the  appellant
    was able to meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM in terms  of
    salary.

    The grounds and submissions

 3. In the grounds, reference is made to section  85  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act")  to  the  effect  that
    even though the appellant did not meet the  financial  requirements  of
    the Rules as at the date of the application or decision,  the  evidence
    showed that she did meet those requirements at the date of the  hearing
    and the FtJ should have taken that evidence into account.

 4. It is said in the grounds that  there  was  no  dispute  but  that  the
    sponsor had been employed by a new company since October 2015 and  that
    his annual salary was �18,999.96.  He had produced a P60 and  payslips.
    The FtJ had failed to  make  any  findings  in  terms  of  whether  the
    documents would satisfy Appendix FM and simply dismissed the appeal  on
    the basis that the documents were not before the respondent.

 5. In submissions on behalf  of  the  appellant,  Ms  Blair,  anticipating
    submissions on behalf of the respondent to the effect  that  the  Rules
    state that the evidence must relate to the date of application,  relied
    on what she said was the evidential flexibility within the Rules.

 6. It was also submitted that if the only reason for the  appellant  being
    required to leave the UK was so that she could make an application  for
    entry clearance from abroad, the appeal should have been allowed.   She
    relied on the decision in Chikwamba v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2008] UKHL 40.

 7. It was submitted that the  arguments  in  relation  to  Chikwamba  were
    advanced before the First-tier Tribunal.

 8. On behalf of the respondent Mr Clarke submitted that  given  that  this
    was a human rights appeal, the Rules could only assist in terms of  the
    proportionality assessment.  It was accepted that the Tribunal can take
    account of evidence provided at a hearing but here the appellant  could
    not succeed under the Rules because the evidence needed  to  relate  to
    the date of application.   The  evidential  flexibility  relied  on  on
    behalf of the appellant in Appendix FM, paragraph D, did not apply.  It
    was open to the judge to "resile" from being a primary  decision  maker
    in respect of evidence not seen by the respondent.  That  evidence  was
    only  relevant  to  a  consideration  outside  the  Rules  and   in   a
    consideration of Chikwamba.



 9. Although it was initially submitted that the Chikwamba argument was not
    advanced before the FtJ, I pointed out to the parties that, albeit  not
    entirely clear, it did appear  from  the  FtJ's  manuscript  record  of
    proceedings that Chikwamba was cited in argument.

10. Mr Clarke relied on the decision in R (On the application  of  Chen)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (Appendix FM -  Chikwamba  -
    temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC)  in
    particular at [39].  The appellant would need to show that there  would
    be significant interference with family life by temporary removal,  and
    this had not been demonstrated.  At [11] of the FtJ's decision  it  was
    pointed out that it had not been argued on behalf of the appellant that
    there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  between   the
    appellant and her spouse in Serbia.

11. The FtJ had looked at the appeal outside the confines of the Article  8
    Rules  but  found  that  there  were  no  exceptional   or   compelling
    circumstances meaning that the appeal should be allowed  under  Article
    8.

12. Ms Blair submitted that the witness statement of the appellant and  her
    spouse did refer to difficulties in their being  separated.   She  said
    that she understood that they were asked questions at the hearing about
    their ability to support themselves.

13. There had never been  any  consideration  of  the  Chikwamba  argument.
    Although that is not a matter that is in the grounds, it  is  the  only
    way that the grounds could be read.  There would be no public  interest
    in entry clearance  being  refused.   There  was  a  need  for  anxious
    scrutiny given that this was a human rights appeal.

    Conclusions

14. The FtJ pointed out at [9] that the evidence submitted  in  support  of
    the application related to the appellant's  spouse's  employment  which
    came to  an  end  in  September  2015.   Reliance  was  placed  on  his
    employment since October 2015 at an annual salary of  �18,999.96.   The
    FtJ referred to a  number  of  documents  in  the  appellant's  bundle,
    including a P60 and payslips together with copies of  bank  statements.
    The FtJ noted that the sponsor's contract of employment at page  59  of
    the bundle was dated 26 August 2015.

15. It is accepted that  none  of  this  information  was  put  before  the
    respondent, and did not form the basis of the application for leave  to
    remain or of the respondent's decision.  Although it was submitted that
    it had been argued that the financial requirements of  the  Rules  were
    met at the time of the decision (assuming this means  the  respondent's
    decision), that is not apparent from the FtJ's  decision.   Indeed,  at
    [9] the FtJ stated that the appellant does not  dispute  that  she  was
    unable to meet the financial requirements of Appendix  FM  (implicitly,
    in terms of the evidence that was before the respondent).

16. The grounds of appeal and the appellant's skeleton argument, the latter
    being dated the day of the hearing before me, both advanced the  appeal
    on the basis that the FtJ was  wrong  not  to  take  into  account  the
    evidence of the sponsor's finances and employment at the  date  of  the
    hearing, and that as at that date the evidence  demonstrated  that  the
    financial requirements of the Rules were met.  It is said at [8] of the
    skeleton argument that there is no reference in the Rules to having  to
    meet the requirements at the date of application only.  It is suggested
    at [9] that some criteria, for example an age criteria at the  date  of
    application, apply but "there is no such requirement in respect of  the
    financial requirements".  It is also said at [9] that the Rules do  not
    limit the financial evidence to the date of application.  According  to
    [14] of the skeleton argument "The matter is very straightforward". The
    FtJ had found that the appellant did not meet  the  Immigration  Rules,
    but that this was incorrect and that as a result she had "purported  to
    refuse a human rights appeal incorrectly".

17. There is no reference in the grounds or in the skeleton argument to any
    argument relating to Article 8 more widely, and  none  specifically  in
    relation to the Chikwamba point.

18. Ms Blair sought to suggest that the grounds could only be read in  that
    context in terms of a wider Article 8 argument.  However, it  is  clear
    that the grounds upon which permission was granted  are  predicated  on
    the proposition that the appellant did not need to establish  that  the
    financial requirements of the  Rules  were  met  at  the  date  of  the
    decision.

19. It is apparent that it was only after  Ms  Blair  was  provided  by  Mr
    Clarke with an extract from Appendix FM-SE on the day  of  the  hearing
    before me, that it was recognised that there is a 'timeline' in respect
    of the provision of financial  information  relating  to  the  date  of
    application.  For example, in Appendix  FM-SE,  2(a)(i)  it  refers  to
    payslips covering  a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
    application in terms of salaried employment.   Another  example  is  at
    paragraph 13 which states that  in  the  calculation  of  gross  annual
    income a person needed to have been employed by their current  employer
    for at least six months and been paid  throughout  the  period  of  six
    months prior to the date of application etc.  Under paragraph A1(b)(ii)
    it requires that in order to meet the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules the requirements as to time periods must be met.

20. The premise of the appeal in relation to the FtJ's failure to take into
    account financial evidence that was not provided at  the  date  of  the
    application and was not before the respondent, is flawed.

21. Whilst it does appear to be the case that the decision in Chikwamba was
    referred to at the hearing before the FtJ, the grounds of appeal do not
    rely on any argument in terms of any failure on the part of the FtJ  to
    consider that issue.  There was no application to amend the grounds  of
    appeal, either in advance of the  hearing  or  indeed  at  the  hearing
    itself.  I do not accept that the grounds incorporate such an argument.



22. Furthermore, it is not in any event the case that  the  FtJ  failed  to
    consider the issue of the appellant applying for entry  clearance  from
    Serbia as a partner.  At [11] she said that it would  be  open  to  the
    appellant to make such an application.  The grounds  do  not  challenge
    her conclusion in that respect.  Likewise, in the  same  paragraph  the
    FtJ said that it had not been argued on behalf of  the  appellant  that
    there were insurmountable obstacles to their continuing family life  in
    Serbia.   She  said  that  the  phrase  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in
    paragraph EX.1(b) imposed a high hurdle to be  overcome,  referring  to
    the decision of the Court of Appeal in Agyarko v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ  440  (now  see  [2017]  UKSC  11).
    Again, there is no challenge in the grounds to that aspect of the FtJ's
    decision.

23. Although it is said that the witness statements of  the  appellant  and
    her spouse refer to the difficulties that there would be in separation,
    that is not a matter that is dealt with in detail, merely being  stated
    as indicative of the closeness of  their  relationship.  There  was  no
    evidence before the FtJ which would indicate that a temporary period of
    separation would amount to any significant interference with her family
    life with the sponsor (see [39] of Chen).

24.  The  FtJ  did  consider  Article  8  more  widely,  referring  to  the
    appellant's leave to remain having been a temporary one, as a  student,
    and that she could have had no expectation of any more permanent  grant
    of leave.  She accepted that they had family life together and that the
    appellant will have established a private life in the UK,  albeit  that
    there was no evidence from any friends or community organisations.  She
    referred to s.117A-B of the 2002 Act  and  noted  the  public  interest
    considerations that arise.  She noted that the appellant's private life
    was established at a time when her immigration status was precarious.

25. Although it is said in the grounds that the FtJ  erred  in  failing  to
    make a finding in terms of whether the 'new' evidence of the  sponsor's
    employment met the requirements of the Rules, the argument is based  on
    the fallacy that it would meet those requirements.  The  fact  is  that
    the evidence did not meet the requirements of the Rules in terms of the
    time of its submission.  The failure to meet the  requirements  of  the
    Rules was plainly a relevant public interest factor to  be  taken  into
    account.  The FtJ said at [14] within  a  consideration  of  Article  8
    proper, that the appellant did not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  I do not consider that there is any error of law in  the  FtJ's
    not having made  an  express  finding  in  terms  of  whether  the  new
    financial information would, hypothetically, meet the  requirements  of
    the Rules if that evidence or information was provided at the  relevant
    time.

26. In terms of the  appellant's  reliance  on  what  is  said  to  be  the
    evidential flexibility aspects of Appendix FM-SE, paragraph D  provides
    that the Secretary of State will only consider documents submitted with
    the application, and  only  in  limited  circumstances  will  documents
    submitted after the application be considered.  Those circumstances can
    be summarised as reflecting what is known as 'evidential  flexibility',
    for example, a document  in  a  sequence  being  missing.   Nothing  in
    paragraph D indicates any discretion on the part of the  respondent  in
    relation to documents which simply fail to meet the requirements of the
    Rules.

27. In summary, I am not satisfied that there is any error of  law  on  the
    part of the FtJ in the terms upon  which  permission  was  granted,  or
    indeed on any other basis.

Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point  of  law.   Its  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
    therefore stands.
