                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                     AG

                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The Secretary of State is the appellant before the Upper  Tribunal.  She
    obtained permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against  a  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 10 August  2015  allowing  the
    appellants' appeals on Refugee Convention grounds.

 2. By way of emails dated 18 and 19 November 2015 the Respondent  seeks  to
    withdraw her case before the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing the terms of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  and  the
    agreement between the parties, I give such consent to the  Secretary  of
    State to withdraw.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform  the  parties  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's case is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of this is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are
    at an end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal and  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision shall stand.
