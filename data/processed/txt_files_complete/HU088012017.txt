                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Moore ("the judge"), promulgated on 18 January 2019,  in
    which he dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    decision of 22 May 2017, refusing his application for  entry  clearance
    and thereby refusing his human rights claim.

 2. In essence the claim had been made by the Appellant (just a day  before
    he reached his 18th birthday) to join his  mother  and  father  in  the
    United Kingdom.  In refusing the human  rights  claim,  the  Respondent
    proceeded to consider the matter under paragraph 301 of the Immigration
    Rules ("the Rules").   Concerns  were  raised  about  the  relationship
    between the Appellant and the claimed parents and whether  or  not  the
    Appellant had been living an independent life.  Reference was also made
    to the fact that by the date of the decision the Appellant  had  turned
    18.  No issues were raised in respect of maintenance and  accommodation
    issues.

 3. On review by an Entry Clearance Manager,  the  issue  relating  to  the
    Appellant's age was quite properly conceded in light of paragraph 27 of
    the Rules. The other points were maintained.

The judge's decision

 4. In deciding the appeal, the judge proceeded on the basis that paragraph
    301 was the applicable Rule.  Nothing to the contrary was indicated  by
    either of the representatives appearing before him.  The  judge  had  a
    number of concerns about various aspects of the evidence including  the
    ability of the Appellant's grandfather to continue looking  after  him,
    the nature of the financial support, contact between the Appellant  and
    his mother in the United Kingdom, and the  mother's  earnings  in  this
    country. The judge concluded that  the Appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements if paragraph 301 and that the appeal had to fail.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 5. The grounds of appeal challenging the judge's decision assert  that  he
    erroneously applied paragraph 301 of the Rules rather than the relevant
    provisions under Appendix FM to the Rules.  It is also  said  that  the
    judge erred in his consideration of the mother's ability to  adequately
    maintain the Appellant.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Keith  on  29
    May 2019.

The hearing before me

 7. Before me it was agreed by both representatives that paragraph  301  of
    the Rules was not the correct provision.   In  light  of  the  relevant
    transitional provisions, the Respondent, and then in  turn  the  judge,
    should have considered the Appellant's application in light of Appendix
    FM, in particular those provisions  relating  to  the  application  for
    entry clearance by a child to join the parent or  parents  residing  in
    the United Kingdom with limited leave to remain (section E-ECC).

 8. Ms Cunha accepted the biological relationship between both parents  and
    the Appellant and that the parents' limited  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom was based upon their parentage of a British child.

Decision on error of law

 9. It is clear that the judge erred by, albeit inadvertently, applying the
    wrong Rule to  the  Appellant's  case,  as  had  the  Respondent.   The
    question is whether this error is material.

10. Ms Ofei-Kwatia submitted that it was because the  test  of  maintenance
    was not that relating to the minimum income requirement and the need to
    provide specified evidence, but rather that of adequacy in light of  E-
    ECC.2.3A of Appendix FM.  She submitted that sufficient evidence of the
    ability to adequately maintain the Appellant had indeed  gone  in  with
    the application and was before the judge.

11. I agree that the judge's error  was  material  in  particular  for  the
    reasons put forward by Ms Ofei-Kwatia.  In my view, although the  judge
    did have concerns about the Appellant's mother's earnings, he  did  not
    consider all of the relevant evidence in the context of the  applicable
    maintenance test.  In addition, the other matters of concern raised  by
    the judge did not in fact go to the relevant issues under E-ECC.

12. It cannot be said that a consideration of the correct provisions of the
    Rules could have made no difference to the outcome.  Indeed,  Ms  Cunha
    accepted that this must be the case.

13. In light of the above, I set the judge's decision aside.

Remaking the decision in this case

14. I now go on to remake the  decision  in  this  appeal  based  upon  the
    applicable provisions of Appendix FM. Having seen the  covering  letter
    sent in with the application by the Appellant's representatives, it  is
    quite clear that reliance was placed on section E-ECC  of  Appendix  FM
    from the outset. Ms Cunha specifically stated that I should  now  apply
    those provisions. It was, quite rightly,  not suggested that  any  "new
    matter" arose.

15. There is no dispute that the Appellant was able  to  meet  all  of  the
    requirements of the relationship criteria.  There is no issue as to the
    Appellant's age as at the making of the application.

16. The sole issue relates to the adequacy of maintenance and accommodation
    under E-ECC 2.3A.  In respect of the relevant case law on this issue  I
    direct myself to KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT 00065.   I  note  that  the
    Respondent did not take any issue  with  maintenance  or  accommodation
    when refusing the Appellant's human rights claim albeit on the basis of
    an incorrect provision of the Rules. I note that the  adequacy  of  the
    maintenance test is the same under E-ECC 2.3A and paragraph 301.

17. I have been helpfully  provided  with  references  to  the  Appellant's
    bundle in respect of the earnings of both his mother and father in  the
    time running up  to  the  date  of  decision.   On  the  basis  of  the
    unchallenged evidence to which I have been  referred,  I  am  satisfied
    that as at the date of decision the  combined  gross  earnings  of  the
    parents amounted to �33,804 a year, that being �2,876 a  month.   I  am
    satisfied that the monthly rent at the relevant time was �800 and  that
    the council tax was approximately �135 a month.   Once  these  relevant
    deductions are made, the monthly net income of the couple was �1,882.

18. I then move on to compare this with the relevant family unit in receipt
    of Income Support.  This family unit would have consisted of two adults
    and four dependent children, with an additional weekly Family  Premium.
    I am satisfied that the correct monthly figures are  as  follows.   For
    the couple, �497.68 a month; for the four dependent children, �1,159.60
    a month; with the family premium being �75.61 a  month.  The  total  of
    this was �1,732.89 a month.

19. When one deducts the  Income  Support  figure  from  the  parents'  net
    monthly income one is left with an excess of �149.11 per month  in  the
    Appellant's favour.  Thus, the adequacy of  the  maintenance  threshold
    was met as at the date of decision.  There has been no challenge to the
    adequacy of accommodation  and  there  is  ample  evidence  within  the
    Appellant's bundle to show that such accommodation was in place at  all
    material times.

20. Ms Cunha expressly  accepted  that  if  it  could  be  shown  that  the
    Appellant met the appropriate Rule as at the date of decision, he would
    be entitled to succeed in his appeal in light of TZ  (Pakistan)  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 1109.

21. In light of my findings as a whole and in relation to the  adequacy  of
    maintenance and  accommodation  in  particular,  I  conclude  that  the
    Appellant did meet all of the relevant provisions under Appendix FM  as
    at the date of decision.

22. In turn, given Ms Cunha's position that satisfaction of the  applicable
    Rule as at the  date  of  the  Respondent's  decision  should  lead  to
    success, I conclude that the Appellant's appeal falls to be allowed  on
    Article 8 grounds.

23. Even if I was obliged to consider the Appellant's circumstances  as  at
    the date of hearing before me (with reference to  the  amended  section
    85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002),  it  would
    make no difference to the outcome. On  the  evidence,  the  Appellant's
    application for entry clearance was put on the correct footing from the
    very start, that being section E-ECC of  Appendix  FM.  It  is  equally
    clear that the evidence submitted with that application was  sufficient
    for the maintenance and accommodation criteria to have been met. Whilst
    the Entry Clearance Officer had concerns over the relationship  between
    the Appellant and his parents, this has  been  proved  by  way  of  DNA
    evidence. Therefore, had the Respondent considered the Appellant's case
    on a correct footing from the outset (as he undoubtedly  should  have),
    the only issue would have  related  to  the  familial  relationship,  a
    matter that was subsequently met with  incontrovertible  evidence.  The
    Respondent's flawed approach to the Appellant's  case  throughout  this
    prolonged period is a  significant  matter,  and,  taking  all  of  the
    circumstances into account, I would regard  this  Article  8  claim  as
    being sufficiently strong to justify allowing the appeal in any event.



Anonymity

24. No anonymity direction is made.




Notice of decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making  of  a  material
error of law.

I set that decision aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the Appellant's appeal.
