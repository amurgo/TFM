                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Brewer, promulgated on 16th October 2018, following a hearing at Taylor
    House  on  27th  September  2018.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.





The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, who was born on  16th
    November 1969.  He appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 4th February 2018, refusing his application for leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom, on the basis that he had wrongly declared  self-
    employment earnings on his application for indefinite leave to  remain,
    and had therefore properly been  refused  on  the  basis  of  paragraph
    322(5) of HC 395.

The Judge's Findings

 3. In a careful and comprehensive determination, the judge, at the  outset
    stated that he had found the Appellant to be a  credible  witness,  and
    that his evidence was  consistent  with  contemporaneous  documentation
    (paragraph 17).  The  Appellant  had  come  to  the  UK  as  a  student
    dependant on 10th October 2007 and had valid leave to  remain  in  this
    country ever since.  He married a Miss [SB], in 1996 and  she  came  to
    the UK to study and the Appellant followed in October of that year, and
    they now had a child born to them in 2009 who  was  a  British  citizen
    (see paragraphs 17 to 20).  The difficulty, however, in the Appellant's
    further applications to remain here, and particularly  in  relation  to
    his application for indefinite leave to remain,  arose  from  the  fact
    that  he  had  declared  earnings  from  self-employment   as   �68,358
    (paragraph 21) but his tax returns for the relevant  years  showed  his
    net profit as being just �5,830 (see paragraphs 21 to 22).  This led to
    the Respondent Secretary of State refusing his application.

 4. When at the hearing,  the  Appellant's  declaration  of  the  requisite
    information was considered by the judge, the judge  observed  that  the
    Respondent did not use the term "dishonest" in the decision letter.  To
    the extent that the Appellant had deliberately given false  information
    in his 2011 visa application, the Judge was content to assume  that  it
    was in this sense that there  had  been  an  allegation  of  dishonesty
    (paragraph 27).  Having considered the matter,  thereafter,  there  did
    not appear to be an innocent explanation for the discrepancy on the tax
    return in the 2011 application (paragraph  38).   The  judge  therefore
    proceeded to consider Article 8 outside  the  Immigration  Rules  (from
    paragraph 40 onwards).  He  cited  a  wealth  of  case  law.   He  then
    concluded that the salient facts here were that the  Appellant's  child
    was a 9 year old British citizen, who had lived in the family unit with
    his parents for the whole of his life, and that  the  Appellant's  wife
    had some health  issues  but  there  was  no  suggestion  that  if  the
    Appellant was removed his wife and child would go with  him  (paragraph
    47).  The judge expressly considered the best interests of the child to
    remain in the UK with both parents (paragraph 48) and observed that the
    refusal of leave to the Appellant would undoubtedly have an impact upon
    the Appellant,  but  the  Appellant's  child  could  then  relocate  to
    Bangladesh, and could adapt to life there, and there was no reason  why
    this could not be done, particularly as "the Appellant did not  suggest
    there would be any difficulties on return whether for him or his family
    other than at paragraphs 22 and 23 of his witness statement" (paragraph
    48).

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that  the  judge  made  an  inadequate
    Section 55 assessment in that he failed to give sufficient  reasons  as
    to why he found it to be  in  the  "best  interests"  of  this  British
    national child to leave the United Kingdom (at paragraphs  47  to  48).
    The facts here were that the  Appellant's  child  had  never  lived  in
    Bangladesh.  He had continued with his education in the UK.  He  was  a
    British national child.  He will be deprived  of  the  benefits  of  UK
    education.  He would also be deprived of NHS treatment in this  country
    for his healthcare.  He had his circle of friends here which  he  would
    lose.  He would also face inevitable language and cultural barriers  in
    Bangladesh if he was returned there.

 7. Second, it was argued that the judge had made no finding as to  whether
    it would be reasonable for the Appellant's  son  to  leave  the  UK  in
    accordance  with  Section  117B(6).   Under  that   provision   express
    consideration had to be given, in circumstances where it  was  accepted
    there was a genuine and subsisting parental relationship, to whether or
    not it would be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.

 8. Third, the proportionality  assessment  was  deficient  and  the  judge
    failed to follow the approach in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705, and
    to the recent decision in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53.

 9. On 14th November 2018 permission to appeal was granted by the  Tribunal
    on the basis that the judge had made no reference  to  Section  117B(6)
    and it  was  arguable  that  he  failed  to  consider  whether  it  was
    reasonable to expect a  British  citizen  child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 3rd January 2019, Mr  Aslam,  appearing  as
    Counsel on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,  relied  upon  the  Grounds  of
    Application.   He  submitted  that  the  basic  error  of  the  judge's
    determination was his  failure  (starting  from  paragraph  40  of  the
    determination) to distinguish the Section 55  considerations  from  the
    wrongdoing of the father.  This impacted upon the judge's  decision  as
    to whether it will be "reasonable" to expect the Appellant's  child  to
    go and live in Bangladesh.   Second,  there  was  no  consideration  of
    Section 117B(6) in relation to the question of whether  it  was  indeed
    "reasonable" to expect the child to go and live  in  Bangladesh.   This
    was important bearing in mind that this was a  British  national  child
    who had not lived in Bangladesh.  Essentially, the judge had  conflated
    the wrongdoing of the father with the best interests of the  child,  in
    the Section 55 consideration, which it was not open to the judge to do.



11. For his part, Mr Lindsay submitted that there  was  no  error  of  law.
    First, it was not material to fail to mention Section 117B(6), and this
    had been conceded by Mr Aslam today during  his  submissions.   Second,
    the Appellant could not succeed  under  KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53
    because of  what  the  Supreme  Court  said  at  paragraph  51  of  the
    determination.  Here the Supreme Court considered whether Section  117B
    in  this  application  meant  that  parental  misconduct  had   to   be
    disregarded.  Lord Carnwath stated that,

         "The parents' conduct was relevant in that it meant that  they  had
         to leave the country.  As I have explained, it was in that  context
         that it had to be considered whether  it  was  reasonable  for  the
         children to leave with them.  Their best interests would have  been
         for the whole family to remain here.  But in a  context  where  the
         parents have to leave, the natural expectation  will  be  that  the
         children would go with them, and there was nothing in the  evidence
         reviewed by the judge to suggest that  that  would  be  other  than
         reasonable" (paragraph 51).

12. It was implicit in this, submitted Mr Lindsay, that, in considering the
    parent's  conduct,  this  would  have  an  impact  on  whether  it  was
    reasonable for the child to leave with the parent, and  this  was  what
    Lord Carnwath had stated here.  Third, where it is  the  case  that  in
    considering Section 117C(2), "the nature of the offending"  should  not
    be taken into account (see paragraph 42 of Lord  Carnwath's  judgment),
    given that

         "It will normally be reasonable for the child to be with them [i.e.
         their parents].  To that extent  the  record  of  the  parents  may
         become indirectly material, if at least leads to their  ceasing  to
         have the right to remain here and having to leave.  It is only  if,
         even on that hypothesis, it would not be reasonable for  the  child
         to leave that  the  provision  may  give  the  parents  to  remain"
         (paragraph 18 of Lord Carnwath's judgment).

13. In this case, this is exactly what the judge had held.  This was  clear
    from the judge's determination at paragraphs 47  to  48,  where  it  is
    plain that the judge does not conflate a consideration of  the  child's
    best interests with the wrongdoing  of  the  father,  but  treats  this
    distinctly in its own right.

14. In reply, Mr Aslam submitted that the wrongdoing of the  parent  cannot
    be included in any Section 55 best interests analysis for the rights of
    the child.  In this case, the best interests of the child may have been
    undervalued (see paragraph 6 of the grounds), and this may be the  case
    because only at paragraphs 47 to 48 does the  judge  actually  consider
    Section 55 of the relevant statutory  provision  with  respect  to  the
    child's best interests.

15. He asked me to allow the appeal.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

17. First, there is a question of the judge's  approach.   It  is  not  the
    case, as has been  submitted  before  me  today,  that  the  judge  has
    conflated the Section 55 best interests  of  the  child  considerations
    with the wrongdoing of the  father.   The  judge  first  sets  out  the
    precise position of the 9-year old British child in this case, who  has
    lived the whole of his life with his parents in this in  this  country.
    Indeed, the judge then goes on to say (at paragraph 48) that  the  best
    interests of the child are to remain with both parents in this case.

18. Second, however, the weakness in the Appellant's appeal, lay in his not
    being able  to  demonstrate  what  the  precise  difficulties  were  in
    relation to this Appellant's child relocating to Bangladesh  with  him,
    should that be the case.  This is clear from the judge's determination.
     He first states that

         "There is no suggestion that if the Appellant were removed his wife
         and child would not go with him and no  evidence  was  led  of  any
         particularly difficult obstacles the child, or indeed  the  parents
         would face in relocating to Bangladesh where both parents were born
         and where they lived for most of their lives" (paragraph 47).

19. The judge then also goes  on  to  explain  that,  whilst  it  is  being
    suggested that the Appellant's child has  no  experience  of  schooling
    outside the  UK,  and  that  there  are  "significant  difficulties  in
    reintegration", the Appellant "does not in fact say what they would be"
    (paragraph 48).  It was for the Appellant to make good  his  case.   He
    was unable to do so on the facts that were presented to the judge.

20. Third, there then arose the question of the position  with  respect  to
    the law.  The governing authority  now  is,  of  course,  KO  (Nigeria)
    [2018] UKSC 53.  This records how the  government's  IDI  (22  February
    2018) makes it clear that

         "The consideration of  the  child's  best  interests  must  not  be
         affected by the conduct or immigration history of the parent(s)  or
         primary carer, but these will be relevant to the assessment of  the
         public interest, including  in  maintaining  effective  immigration
         control ..." (paragraph 11 of Lord Carnwath's judgment).

21. The decision of the Supreme  Court  refers  to  the  IDI  guidance  and
    implicitly approves it thereafter when it states (at paragraph 18) that
    "to that extent  the  record  of  the  parents  may  become  indirectly
    material" because when the public interest  is  considered  the  record
    cannot at that stage be excluded.  This leads the Supreme Court to  the
    eventual conclusion (at paragraph  19)  that  the  situation  has  been
    looked at in a way "that 'reasonableness' is to be  considered  in  the
    real world in which the children find themselves" (paragraph 19).   The
    real world is that neither parent has  the  right  to  remain  in  this
    country, and in circumstances where the Appellant did not suggest  what
    the difficulties of reintegration precisely would be (see paragraph 48)
    before the judge, the conclusion that the child could reasonably go  to
    Bangladesh with the Appellant was one that was open  to  the  judge  to
    come to.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
