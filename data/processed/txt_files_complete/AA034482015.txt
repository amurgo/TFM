Immigration LLP
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal comes back before the Upper Tribunal following a hearing on
    1 April 2015 before me, following which I decided that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge ("the FtJ") had erred in  law  in  his  assessment  with
    respect to Article 8 of the ECHR.  I have set  aside  his  decision  in
    that respect only,  for  the  decision  to  be  re-made  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  I decided that the FtJ's  conclusions  in  relation  to  the
    asylum aspect of the appeal were free from any error of law.

 2. At the resumed hearing before me certain preliminary  submissions  were
    made with respect to the respondent's withdrawal  of  a  concession  in
    terms of the appellant's relationship with  a  child  said  to  be  his
    daughter, 'J', born on [ ] 2011, and in relation to  the  applicability
    of the suitability requirements of the Article 8 Immigration Rules.   I
    set out those issues more fully below.

 3. The error of law decision is attached as an annex to this decision.  To
    summarise however, the appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  ("the
    FtT") followed  a  decision  dated  24  February  2015  to  remove  the
    appellant under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.   In
    relation to the Article 8 ground of appeal, the appellant relied on his
    relationship to a British citizen partner with whom he had  been  in  a
    relationship since 2008 and whom he met in the UK.  They have  a  child
    to whom I have already referred.

 4. In the error of law decision at [41] I said that the findings  of  fact
    made by the FtT were to stand, except insofar as they are  infected  by
    the error(s) of law that I found.

 5. I also gave directions  on  29  July  2015  for  the  resumed  hearing,
    following an adjourned hearing.  The directions in particular  required
    the appellant's representatives to file and serve  supporting  evidence
    in relation to the DNA sampling.  The DNA evidence  was  relied  on  in
    support of the contention that the appellant is the father of J.  Those
    directions were not complied with,  nor  were  the  earlier  directions
    which were given at the end of the error of law decision.  I also  deal
    with this issue further, below.

 6. Following the preliminary submissions at the resumed  hearing,  further
    oral evidence was given, and which I summarise.

    The oral evidence

 7. In examination-in-chief  the  appellant  adopted  his  further  witness
    statement dated 9 March 2016.  He was asked  about  his  conviction  in
    2007 for driving with excess alcohol.  He said  that  he  had  gone  to
    court and had been fined about �500.  He initially  said  that  he  had
    been arrested but "not really" convicted.  In relation to  the  offence
    of possession of a false document in  2014  for  which  he  received  a
    sentence of four months' imprisonment, he said that he was working with
    a company and they paid him by cheque.  He did not have a bank  account
    so he used fake identification, obtaining a  fake  driving  licence  in
    order to cash the cheque at a money shop in Marble Arch.   The  driving
    licence had his photograph and his name in it.

 8. He had lived in the UK for 14 years and prior  to  that  had  lived  in
    India, doing farming.  In the UK he had worked as a labourer  and  then
    as a construction supervisor.

 9. If he was allowed to stay in the UK he would work in  the  same  field.
    He could earn �16 - �19 per hour, roughly �18,000 - �19,000 per  annum,
    or more if he obtained overtime.

10. He is a Sikh and his wife is a Muslim.  Their  daughter  is  both,  and
    when she is 16 she would be allowed to  choose.   They  would  not  put
    pressure on her.

11. He comes from Punjab.  It is a Sikh community and there is fighting and
    killing there.  It would be very hard for his wife and his daughter  to
    live there.  Going to school or college she could be abused.  He thinks
    it would be dangerous for her and for his wife.

12. In cross-examination he said that when he was fined  for  drinking  and
    driving he did not have a driving licence.  He was  also  convicted  of
    that offence.  He said that he surrendered himself to the police.

13. He gave the name of a friend who was looking after  their  daughter  on
    the day of the hearing.  She is aged 4 and goes to  nursery  every  day
    between the hours of 8.30 and 11.15.

14. His wife is not working and nor is he, although he wants to.

15. His daughter is going to school in September, and he named the  school.
    When his daughter goes to school his wife would not be able to do full-
    time work but she may be able to do a few hours.

16. He is not really in touch with his family in India.  It is a long  time
    since he had spoken to his father.  He had not spoken  to  his  mother.
    His parents know that he is married.  They have spoken to  his  wife  a
    few times, but in Sikh culture it is no good for him to marry his wife.
     He wants to marry her but he does not have ID in order to get married.
     His parents do  approve  of  her  and  they  know  that  they  have  a
    granddaughter.  They send photographs of their daughter.

17. It would be hard to imagine him and his wife staying with  his  parents
    in a village in Punjab.  That would not be possible because  she  is  a
    Muslim and they do not accept Muslims there.  It would be the  same  if
    they went south, for example to Bangalore.  They  would  have  to  find
    work.  They both know life in the UK and  it  would  be  hard  for  his
    daughter to be educated and for them to live.  The main thing for their
    daughter is education.

18. The appellant's partner, SB, adopted  her  witness  statement  dated  9
    March 2016 and the contents of letters she had written  by  hand.   She
    said that she is a British citizen and her family are  originally  from
    Pakistan.

19. She had only been out of the UK when she was aged 11, when she went  to
    Pakistan for six weeks  after  her  mother  passed  away.   She  speaks
    English, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu.  Their daughter  speaks  English  and
    only a few words of Punjabi.

20. Insofar as employment is concerned,  she  has  experience  in  business
    administration  and  had  done  reception   work   as   part   of   her
    qualifications although she had never worked as an employee.   She  had
    only ever worked as an apprentice, training to be  a  receptionist  for
    which she was not paid.  She did that for six months.

21. The last time she had any contact with her father was when she left her
    house in 2008.  Her brother obtained her phone  number  last  year  and
    called her, to abuse her.  He said that  she  had  lowered  the  family
    name, and started swearing at her.

22. She has three brothers. She has not spoken to the other two since 2008.
     On her father's side she has two aunts and many cousins.  She  has  no
    contact with relatives on her mother's or her father's side as they  do
    not accept that she is with an Indian person.  Even her own friends are
    the same.  It is not acceptable in her culture to be with a non-Muslim.
     She has two or three friends in the UK  but  they  had  moved  out  of
    London.

23. Their daughter at the time of the hearing was with their  friend,  whom
    she named.  He is a Sikh.  As  far  as  their  daughter's  religion  is
    concerned, they would teach her both Sikh and Muslim cultures and  when
    she grows up she would be able to choose.

24. She goes to nursery between 8.30 and 11.15am.  Next year they hope that
    she would go to the same primary school.  She gave the  same  name  for
    the school as did the appellant.

25. If she was able to get a job then it would be for a few  hours  because
    she would not be able to work full-time.

26. They could not move to India because she is a Muslim and her husband is
    a Sikh.  In his village they are all Sikhs.  They  would  isolate  them
    and they would have nothing.  Their daughter's life would not  be  good
    and she would be bullied.

27. In cross-examination she said that she speaks to her husband's  parents
    sometimes.  They do accept her.  They know that they have a daughter.

28. She has friends in the UK whom she keeps in touch with even though they
    have moved away from London.  She has a few friends amongst the parents
    at her daughter's nursery.

    Submissions

29. As can be seen from the error of law decision, an  issue  arose  before
    the FtJ in relation to  the  respondent's  purported  withdrawal  of  a
    concession in terms of the appellant's relationship  with  his  partner
    and paternal relationship with J.

30. In preliminary submissions prior  to  the  oral  evidence,  Ms  Everett
    sought to withdraw the concession made in  the  decision  letter  which
    accepts that the appellant is in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with J.  She relied on the respondent's skeleton  argument
    at [5] which sets out the respondent's reasons  for  arguing  that  the
    concession  should  be  allowed  to  be  withdrawn.   Essentially,  the
    appellant's name is not on the child's birth certificate, the appellant
    has  a  bad  immigration  history  and  has  a   propensity   to   "bad
    character/deception".  He had entered the  UK  illegally,  had  made  a
    false asylum claim, had worked unlawfully in the  UK  and  had  used  a
    false document for which he was imprisoned.

31. So far as the DNA report is concerned, it was pointed out that there is
    no further statement from the solicitor who is said to have  taken  the
    sample and  it  was  not  accepted  that  the  DNA  report  proved  the
    relationship.  Furthermore, there was a significant absence of evidence
    of interrelationship between the appellant and  the  child.   The  only
    evidence was to the effect that he lived with the child.

32. Mr Bazini argued that it had not been explained why the concession  was
    being withdrawn in terms of what had changed since the decision letter.
     The appellant was questioned in interview about his  daughter.   There
    was also evidence from the appellant's partner as to their relationship
    and how  traumatised  her  daughter  was  when  the  appellant  was  in
    detention.  Albeit that it is accepted that the directions had not been
    complied with in terms of evidence of the taking of the DNA sample,  it
    would be astonishing if a person  from  the  solicitors'  office  would
    submit evidence to the Tribunal about the taking of a DNA sample if  it
    were not the case.

33. Mr Bazini said that his understanding was that the person who took  the
    sample, Amonpreet Kaur Grewal, is a solicitor.   She  took  the  sample
    from the appellant in detention.  On this Mr Bazini  sought  to  obtain
    further  information  for  which  a  short  adjournment  was   allowed.
    Ultimately, he confirmed that Ms Grewal  is  not  a  solicitor  but  is
    registered with the OISC, and  that  she  had  sent  a  letter  to  the
    Tribunal after the directions had been issued, confirming that she  had
    taken the sample.

34. The respondent's position is to accept that it  would  be  unreasonable
    with reference to Article 8 to expect J to live in India, but that  the
    appellant could go  back  to  India  and  apply  for  entry  clearance.
    Although in the refusal letter  at  [88]  there  is  reference  to  the
    appellant's background, including his convictions, the  respondent  had
    not in fact invoked  the  suitability  requirements  at  S-LTR.1.6.  of
    Appendix FM and had gone on to consider paragraph EX.1.

35. Mr Bazini conceded that the appellant would have no access to  EX.1  if
    the suitability requirements do apply. He said that the first time that
    the issue of the suitability requirements of the Rules was  raised  was
    in the respondent's skeleton argument prepared for the  hearing  before
    the Upper Tribunal.  The fact that EX.1 had previously been  considered
    by the respondent is tantamount to a concession  that  the  suitability
    requirements do not apply it was submitted, and it is not clear  as  to
    why this issue was raised at such a late stage.  The application of the
    suitability requirements needs to have a proper reasoned  decision  for
    it to be decided that the  appellant's  presence  in  the  UK  was  not
    conducive to the public good.

36. Mr Bazini said that his instructions were that there had in  fact  been
    no conviction for  driving  with  excess  alcohol,  and  there  was  no
    reference to a conviction in the decision letter.  Again, so far as the
    late reliance on the suitability  requirements  is  concerned,  it  was
    submitted that the respondent had cynically jumped onto that issue once
    it was accepted that the appellant has a British child who cannot go to
    India.

37. As to submissions made after the oral  evidence,  Ms  Everett  repeated
    earlier submissions in relation to the suitability  requirements,  also
    relying on the fact that the decision letter at [88] raised  the  issue
    of the appellant's convictions and his immigration history.   Following
    the oral evidence it was clear that the appellant had been convicted of
    driving with excess alcohol.  In all the circumstances the appellant is
    not able to meet the requirements of the Article 8 Rules.

38. So far as Article 8 outside  the  Rules  is  concerned,  there  was  no
    evidence as to why he could not return to India and make an application
    for entry clearance, if he saw fit.  The contentions that  his  partner
    does not have enough income to meet the Rules and that she has a child,
    do not amount to reasons as to why the appellant should be  allowed  to
    remain.  Whether or not she accompanies him is a matter for them.

39. Although evidence had been given of apparent difficulties for  them  in
    Punjab, his parents would support them even  if  they  were  not  there
    living with them.  They had plenty of other places they could go to and
    there was no background evidence to suggest that a mixed marriage would
    mean that they could not live anywhere in India.

40. The age of their child does not  render  it  unreasonable  for  her  to
    accompany them to India.  The appellant's partner speaks Punjabi,  Urdu
    and Hindi.  The child is known  to  her  grandparents  and  accordingly
    there would be support and family connections in India.

41. Mr Bazini invited  me  to  make  a  positive  finding  in  relation  to
    credibility.  There was  no  challenge  to  their  evidence  which  was
    consistent, he submitted.  On some  matters  they  had  given  evidence
    which was adverse to their case.

42. As to the suitability requirements, the burden was on the Secretary  of
    State to show that it  was  conducive  to  the  public  good  that  the
    appellant  should  not  be  allowed  leave  to  remain.   Clearly,  the
    Secretary of State was far from convinced as to that point  given  that
    the issue was not raised in the decision letter when all the facts were
    known to the caseworker.  Without an explanation as to  why  there  has
    been a change of heart on this issue, it was submitted that I should be
    slow to accept that it was  conducive  to  the  public  good  that  the
    appellant should not be allowed leave to remain.

43. At best, it is a borderline contention  on  behalf  of  the  respondent
    given that the appellant's conviction for the driving offence was seven
    or eight years ago and there had been no further offences of that type.
     The later custodial sentence of four  months'  imprisonment  (for  the
    false document offence) was at the lowest end  of  the  scale  and  the
    offence was not committed for the purposes of fraud but to allow him to
    cash a cheque in respect of money he had earned.  The  question  arises
    as to whether it was conducive to the public good to take him away from
    his daughter and wife.  None of the other suitability issues  in  terms
    of imprisonment arose.

44. The respondent's position in relation to whether  the  child  could  be
    required to go to India was inconsistent, with the skeleton argument at
    [21(d)] indicating that it would not be reasonable for the child to  go
    to India, but at the hearing the position being argued otherwise.

45. So far as EX.1(b) is concerned, there would be insurmountable obstacles
    to family life with the appellant's partner in India.  If the  starting
    point as per the skeleton argument is taken, namely  that  their  child
    could not be expected to leave the UK, her mother  could  also  not  be
    expected to leave the UK.

46. The decision in Sanade  and  others  (British  children  -  Zambrano  -
    Dereci) India [2012] UKUT 48 (IAC) was relied on, in particular at [93]
    - [95].  It was conceded however, that that was a decision made  before
    the passing of the Immigration Act 2014.

47. It was submitted that it  could  not  seriously  be  suggested  by  the
    respondent that the appellant and his partner would not  have  problems
    in India.  I was invited to take judicial notice of  the  fact  that  a
    Sikh man and a Muslim wife would have difficulties and that there would
    be difficulties for the child at school.

48. Although it is said that the appellant could make  an  application  for
    entry clearance, recognition was needed of the unusual features of  the
    appeal.  The appellant's partner left home when she  was  18  years  of
    age.  Her mother committed suicide and she had been with the  appellant
    ever since.  All her ties with her family had been severed.  She had  a
    real fear of what her family would do if they  came  across  her.   Her
    community had disowned her.   Her  handwritten  letters  show  how  her
    daughter was affected by the appellant's detention, which it  was  said
    was an unlawful detention, being a  matter  that  I  should  take  into
    account.

49. I was also referred to  the  decision  in  R  (on  the  application  of
    Agyarko) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    440, being a recent case on the issue of insurmountable obstacles,  but
    in respect of which there were distinguishing features it was argued.

    My conclusions

50. As regards the respondent's attempt to withdraw the concession made  in
    the decision letter to the effect that the appellant has a genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with J, I announced to the parties that  I  was
    not satisfied that the respondent should be allowed  to  withdraw  that
    concession.  In the error of law decision at [25] I made  reference  to
    the decision of the Court of Appeal in  NR  (Jamaica)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 856, quoting from [12] of
    that  decision  which  refers  to  the  wide  discretion  to  permit  a
    concession to be withdrawn "if in its view there is good reason in  all
    the circumstances for that course to be taken".

51. I said at [33] that the  reasons  given,  certainly  to  the  FtJ,  for
    withdrawal of the concession appeared to be very weak.  The matters  to
    which I was referred at the earlier hearing and at the resumed  hearing
    were all matters that were  before  the  decision  maker  when  it  was
    concluded that  the  appellant  does  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with J.  It was submitted to me that the  absence  of  the
    appellant's name from J's birth certificate was very  significant,  but
    that is not  new  information.   I  do  not  accept  that  there  is  a
    significant absence of evidence of the  interrelationship  between  the
    appellant and J.  The appellant's interview provides  evidence  of  his
    relationship  with  her,  as  do  the  written  statements,   and   the
    handwritten letters from the appellant's partner.

52. I do not see that there is any prejudice to the appellant in  terms  of
    the attempted withdrawal of the concession, at least not at this  stage
    where the appellant has had plenty of notice of  the  issue.   However,
    prejudice is not the determining factor.  It seems to me  that  on  the
    evidence at the time the decision was made,  the  concession  that  the
    appellant is the father of J was a concession that was properly made in
    the light of all the material before the decision maker.  This is not a
    situation where some legislative provision has possibly been overlooked
    or some material evidence has come to light since the decision.

53. In the circumstances, and in the exercise of my discretion,  I  do  not
    permit the respondent's concession as to the  appellant's  relationship
    with J to be withdrawn.

54. In any event, I would otherwise have been satisfied that  the  evidence
    establishes that the appellant is the father of J and  that  he  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with her.  As to  paternity,  there
    is DNA evidence.  It is extremely unsatisfactory that the continuity of
    the DNA  evidence  was  not  established,  particularly  since  I  gave
    directions to that effect. However, there was a letter from  Ms  Grewal
    to the Tribunal stating that she took the DNA sample.  The DNA evidence
    is conclusive once the issue of continuity is resolved.  Furthermore, I
    am inclined to agree with Mr Bazini that it would be remarkable if this
    was a fabrication by  an  OISC-registered  caseworker.   I  accept  the
    written evidence of Ms Grewal, albeit that she should, in  response  to
    the directions, have provided a written statement.

55. Furthermore, the written and oral evidence of  the  appellant  and  his
    partner establishes on a  balance  of  probabilities  that  he  is  the
    child's father, and the evidence is that they all live  together.   The
    appellant and his partner's explanation before the FtT as  to  why  the
    appellant's name is not on the child's birth certificate (they believed
    the  appellant  needed  ID  for  him  to  register  his  name)  is  not
    particularly impressive.  Nevertheless, the other evidence to  which  I
    have referred establishes the parental relationship and the genuineness
    and subsistence of that relationship.

56. So far as the suitability requirements of the Rules are concerned, I do
    not accept Mr Bazini's contention that because in the  decision  letter
    the suitability requirements of the Rules were  not  applied,  that  is
    tantamount to a  concession  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  that  the
    suitability requirements were not applicable.  At the  hearing  I  also
    announced to the parties that I was satisfied that the  respondent  was
    entitled to rely on the suitability requirements of the Rules, and that
    there was no concession on that issue, either express or implied.

57. The relevant requirements of the Rules in this respect are as follows:

         "S-LTR.1.1.   The applicant will be refused limited leave to remain
                  on grounds of suitability if any of paragraphs  S-LTR.1.2.
                  to 1.7. apply.

         ...

         S-LTR.1.6.    The presence of  the  applicant  in  the  UK  is  not
                  conducive  to  the  public  good  because  their   conduct
                  (including convictions which do not fall within paragraphs
                  S-LTR.1.3. to 1.5.),  character,  associations,  or  other
                  reasons, make it undesirable to allow them  to  remain  in
                  the UK."

58. With reference to Immigration Directorate Instructions Family Migration
    ("IDIs") the decision letter at [88] refers  to  the  appellant  having
    entered the UK clandestinely, and staying for a period of over 10 years
    without making any attempt to regularise his stay.  It states  that  he
    has a very poor immigration history and  refers  to  his  "arrest"  for
    drink-driving and the four month custodial sentence for fraud.   It  is
    apparent therefore, that the respondent even at that time took the view
    that the appellant's conduct was an adverse factor  to  be  taken  into
    account when considering the potential for separation between him,  his
    partner and their child.

59. It is true that in the decision letter the respondent did  not  suggest
    that the suitability requirements applied. However, I cannot  see  that
    there is any prejudice to the appellant in permitting the respondent to
    rely on the suitability requirements.  The appellant knew in advance of
    the hearing that this was an issue relied on by the  respondent,  given
    that it was in  the  respondent's  skeleton  argument  at  the  initial
    hearing.

60. Furthermore, it is not a case of the respondent  seeking  to  introduce
    new evidence to support reliance on a provision of the Rules.

61. In addition, it does not seem to me that in circumstances  where  there
    is no forensic prejudice to the appellant,  and  where  notice  of  the
    issue has been given in advance of the hearing, I have power to prevent
    the respondent from relying on a relevant provision of the  Rules  even
    in circumstances where the respondent did not rely on it at the time of
    the decision.

62. It would be different if in a given case the respondent  had  expressly
    or impliedly ruled out reliance on this or that aspect  of  the  Rules.
    The area of enquiry in such a case would  be  much  deeper,  and  again
    involve possible considerations of withdrawal of a  concession.   Here,
    as I have already indicated, there was no express or implied  rejection
    of reliance on the suitability requirements.  It seems to me  that  the
    application of that aspect of the  Rules  was  simply  not  considered,
    albeit that the suitability requirements were set  out,  as  were  many
    other requirements of the Rules.

63. Mr Bazini submitted that on a balance of probabilities it could not  be
    said that the appellant's presence in the UK is not  conducive  to  the
    public good, with reference to  S-LTR.1.6.   I  have  referred  to  his
    submissions on the point in terms of the appellant's convictions.

64. I am prepared to accept that the question of  whether  the  appellant's
    presence in the UK is not conducive in the public good is a matter that
    has to be established by the respondent on a balance of  probabilities.
    Although the matter was not canvassed before me,  it  might  have  been
    argued that it is only the respondent's assessment  that  is  relevant,
    and that the Tribunal cannot express its own view on  the  issue,  once
    the respondent has invoked that provision.  However,  I  bear  in  mind
    that unlike other provisions of S-LTR, S-LTR.1.6. does seem to  involve
    a judgement that is not hard-edged.  For  example,  S-LTR.1.3.  -  1.4.
    state that a person's presence in the UK is not conducive to the public
    good "because" they have been convicted of an offence which attracts  a
    particular period of imprisonment.  Furthermore, S-LTR.1.5. refers to a
    person who "in the view of the Secretary of State" has  offended  in  a
    way which has caused serious  harm,  or  the  person  is  a  persistent
    offender who shows a particular disregard for the law.  In  S-LTR.1.6.,
    it does not state that the person's presence is not  conducive  to  the
    public good because the Secretary of State has taken that view  in  the
    light of conduct etc.

65. I do not  accept  the  argument  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  which,
    seemingly, seeks to introduce a wider  a  consideration  in  S-LTR.1.6.
    than that paragraph of the  Rules  requires.   Mr  Bazini's  rhetorical
    question was whether it was conducive to the public  good  to  separate
    the appellant from his wife and child.  However, that paragraph of  the
    Rules does not require or involve embracing such wider  considerations.
    The question is whether the appellant's  presence  in  the  UK  is  not
    conducive to the public good "because" of his conduct etc.

66.  Nor  do  I  accept  the  proposition  that  the  respondent  has  been
    inconsistent  on  this  issue,  for  reasons  already  explained.   The
    respondent  did  in  the  decision  letter  highlight  the  appellant's
    conduct.

67. It is true that the appellant's  conviction  for  driving  with  excess
    alcohol was several years ago now, occurring  in  2007.   However,  the
    offence of possession of a false document occurred at the end of  2014.
    Although it was submitted that he obtained that document  in  order  to
    obtain cash which he had earned, the fact is he was sentenced to a term
    of  imprisonment.   That  sentence  plainly  reflected  the  sentencing
    judge's view of the criminality.  It is also legitimate  to  take  into
    account the appellant's poor immigration history, having arrived in the
    UK illegally, at the latest in 2004, and remained  illegally.   He  has
    also made a claim for asylum that has been judged to be a false claim.

68. Even taking out of account the issue of the false claim for  asylum,  I
    am satisfied that the respondent has established that  the  appellant's
    presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good in the light  of
    his convictions and his immigration history.  Accordingly,  he  is  not
    able to rely on paragraph EX.1 in any  respect.   It  was  accepted  on
    behalf of the appellant  that  if  paragraph  S-LTR.1.6.  applied,  the
    appellant would not be able to rely on EX.1 in any respect.

69. It also follows then, that the  appellant  is  not  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Article 8 Immigration  Rules.   The  question  then
    arises as to whether there are compelling circumstances not  recognised
    within the Rules,  such  as  to  require  further  consideration  under
    Article 8 proper.  I am satisfied that there  are  such  circumstances.
    That is not to say that all matters advanced in this respect are to  be
    accepted,  simply  that  the  matters   relied   on   require   further
    examination.  Those matters include what is said to be the  appellant's
    wife's isolation, her dependence on the appellant, what is  said  about
    his wife having lost contact with her own  family,  and  the  issue  of
    mixed marriage.

70. The FtJ made a number of findings that are not affected by the error of
    law.  As already indicated, he accepted that the appellant and  SB  are
    in a relationship and that together and with their daughter they have a
    family life.  At [23] he concluded that it may well be that SB's family
    in Huddersfield are not happy with  the  relationship  given  that  the
    appellant is not Pakistani or Muslim.  However, his finding on this  is
    not definitive.

71. He concluded that there was no evidence that any relatives she may have
    in Kashmir have a "reach" in India.  He concluded  that  the  appellant
    had not established that SB  is  at  real  risk  in  the  UK  from  her
    relatives in Huddersfield or that she genuinely believes that she is at
    real risk from anyone in India.

72. It is the case therefore, that the appellant, his wife and  child  have
    family life together.  The respondent's decision  would,  at  least  in
    principle  if  the  appellant  alone  leaves  the  UK,  amount  to   an
    interference  with  that  family  life.   The  interference  will  have
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    Article 8.

73. So far as the appellant's private life is concerned, that  is  not  the
    focus of any argument on his behalf, the focus being on family life.  I
    am prepared to accept, however, that his length of stay in the UK  will
    have resulted in his establishing some form of private life which would
    be interfered with by his removal.

74. So far as proportionality is concerned, it  is  important  to  consider
    firstly the best interests of J.  It  is  uncontroversial  to  conclude
    that a child's best interests are usually best served by  living  in  a
    stable and loving relationship with both parents.   That  is  also  the
    case here.  J's best interests are best served by remaining  with  both
    her parents.  I would also say that it is  in  J's  best  interests  to
    remain in the UK, she being a British citizen.

75. However, as is now well-recognised, a child's best  interests  are  not
    the only consideration.

76. It is true that the respondent has adopted an inconsistent position  in
    terms of whether it would be reasonable to expect J to  leave  the  UK.
    At [21] of the respondent's skeleton argument it is accepted  that  the
    respondent could not argue that it would be reasonable for J  to  leave
    the UK, given her citizenship and thus  the  fact  that  she  would  be
    required also to leave the EU.  Ms Everett's  position  before  me  was
    that it would not be unreasonable to expect J to accompany her  parents
    to live in India, if that is what they decided to do.   Notwithstanding
    the respondent's vacillation on this point, it remains the case that  a
    child's citizenship alone cannot determine the issue of proportionality
    under Article 8, or indeed in terms of whether a person is able to meet
    the  requirements  of  the  Article   8   Rules.    The   question   of
    'reasonableness' must be seen in context.

77. The considerations set out in s.117B must be taken into account in  the
    proportionality assessment.   It  is  the  case  that  the  appellant's
    private life and his relationship with SB were both established when he
    was in the UK unlawfully and his  immigration  status  was  precarious.
    Accordingly, little weight is to be attached to that  relationship  and
    to his private life.

78. In addition, there is in my judgement no reason as to why the appellant
    could not leave the UK and make an application for entry clearance as a
    spouse.  Apart from SB's circumstances, in terms of her reliance on the
    appellant and lack of support in the UK, no other reasons was  advanced
    as to why he could not return and apply for entry clearance.   For  the
    avoidance of doubt, the fact that there may be difficulty in satisfying
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules  for  entry  clearance  as  a
    spouse, cannot be a relevant  consideration.   Similarly,  it  was  not
    argued that the Chikwamba principle (Chikwamba v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40) applies.  This is not a case  where
    the only reason for the appellant to leave the UK is  so  that  he  can
    meet the technical requirement of having to  make  an  application  for
    entry clearance.  There are plainly wider considerations  in  terms  of
    the appellant's immigration history and criminal offending.

79. It was similarly not suggested that visa processing  times  from  India
    meant that any period of separation would be unduly long, or inherently
    disproportionate.

80. Whilst I do accept that SB is isolated from her  family,  the  evidence
    does not indicate that it would be unduly difficult, or impossible, for
    her to manage to care for her daughter without the appellant.   She  at
    least does have some friends amongst  the  parents  of  her  daughter's
    nursery.  In any event, as I have indicated, the period  of  separation
    is not suggested as being particularly lengthy pending  an  application
    for entry clearance.  It is not suggested that either SB or  her  child
    are in anything other than good health, and no considerations  in  that
    respect arise therefore.

81. Whilst it is likely to be that case that J would miss  her  father  for
    the relatively short period of time that was required for him  to  make
    an application for entry clearance, there is no  evidence  to  indicate
    that a short period of separation would have  any  significant  adverse
    effect on her.  She is now 5� years of age and would  have  her  mother
    looking after her, her mother being the main carer.

82. In any event, I also consider that it would not be disproportionate  to
    expect SB and their child to leave the UK to be with the  appellant  in
    India.  In the first place, Article 8  does  not  require  a  State  to
    respect the choice of the parties as to  where  they  wish  to  conduct
    their family life.  J's British citizenship is not the deciding factor.
     J would continue to be cared for by both her parents.

83. The evidence is that the appellant's parents  accept  the  relationship
    between him and SB, and accept their  granddaughter.   Whether  or  not
    they decided to live with the appellant's  parents  in  Punjab,  it  is
    reasonable to conclude that they would have some, at  least,  emotional
    support from them.

84. I was asked to take judicial notice of the fact  of  difficulties  that
    the appellant and SB would encounter on the basis that they  are  in  a
    mixed marriage.  However, aside from the evidence of the appellant  and
    SB on this issue, there was  no  independent  background  evidence  put
    before me which would suggest that they would not be able  to  live  in
    India, for example in one  of  the  big  cities,  or  that  they  would
    encounter such hostility or obstacles as would make  it  impossible  or
    even difficult for them to live peacefully as a family and  to  survive
    and prosper.  I am prepared to accept that in some quarters of  society
    in India there may be some hostility.  However,  there  was  simply  no
    evidence before me which would indicate that as a result of their mixed
    marriage the appellant and his wife and child would not be able to live
    a relatively normal life in India.

85. Although, therefore, it was submitted on behalf of the  appellant  that
    there were "unusual" features of the appeal, on the facts of this  case
    those features do nothing other than permit access to  a  consideration
    of Article 8 outside  the  Rules.   They  do  not  in  fact,  on  close
    analysis, lead to the conclusion that the respondent's decision amounts
    to a disproportionate interference  with  the  appellant's  family  (or
    private) life.  It will be evident from my conclusions that  I  am  not
    satisfied that the Article 8 rights of the appellant, his wife or their
    child are disproportionately affected by the respondent's  decision.  I
    am satisfied that the respondent has established that the decision is a
    proportionate one.

    Decision

86. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law in relation to its decision on Article 8 of the  ECHR
    only.  Its decision in that  respect  is  set  aside.   I  re-make  the
    decision by dismissing the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Mallick, Counsel instructed by A & M
Immigration Solutions LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr L Collingridge, Home Office Presenting Officer



                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


 1. This appeal comes before me following a grant of permission  to  appeal
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge A.J.M.  Baldwin,  who
    heard an appeal by the appellant on 6 March 2015.

87. That appeal followed  a  decision  dated  24  February  2015,  being  a
    decision to remove the appellant under Section 10  of  the  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 1999.  The appeal  was  advanced  on  asylum  and  human
    rights grounds, the human rights grounds including  Article  8  of  the
    ECHR.

88. So far as the asylum claim is concerned, it relates to the  appellant's
    claimed fear of his father's cousin's sons and family on account  of  a
    land dispute  which  arose  in  about  1994  or  1995.   The  land  was
    apparently put in the appellant's name as he was the  eldest  son.   He
    claimed that he had been attacked in India and in  the  UK  because  of
    that land dispute.  He asserts that he could not rely on the police  in
    India  for  protection.   He  would  not  be  able  to  relocate.    In
    particular, in the UK in 2005 in Birmingham he was shot  at  and  as  a
    result of his injuries spent two  or  three  months  in  hospital.   He
    believes that one of the people he fears, Mandeep  Singh,  from  India,
    was behind the shooting.

89. So far as the family and private life claim is concerned, the appellant
    has a British citizen partner with whom he has been in  a  relationship
    since 2008, having met her in the UK.  They have a child together, born
    on 1 October 2011.

    The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

90. At the  start  of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    Presenting Officer announced that  the  respondent  was  withdrawing  a
    concession made in the reasons for refusal letter, to the  effect  that
    the appellant and [SB] are in a relationship, and a concession that the
    appellant is the father of J, her  child.   It  is  as  well  to  quote
    verbatim from  Judge  Baldwin's  determination.   At  [2]  he  said  as
    follows:

         "Ms Mallick sought and was given permission to call examination-in-
         chief unsupported by Statements because the Appellant did not  want
         an adjournment and could not in any even fund representation for  a
         second Hearing.  Ms Jannath then indicated that the Respondent  was
         withdrawing  her  concession  in  relation   to   the   Appellant's
         partnership in the UK.  Ms Mallick said this  placed  her  and  the
         Appellant in difficulty as it might have been  possible  to  secure
         further evidence had it been known this might be  required.   Given
         that the Appellant did not want and could not afford for  the  case
         to go to a second Hearing, and that the partner was present to give
         evidence about the relationship, it was agreed that the case should
         proved."

91. At [23] Judge Baldwin again recorded that the respondent  resiled  from
    the acceptance in the refusal  letter  that  the  appellant  was  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a British  citizen,  and  that
    the Presenting Officer stood by her withdrawal of that  acceptance.  At
    [24], in relation to the  claimed  parental  relationship  between  the
    appellant and J, Judge Baldwin said that:

         "The Appellant, I conclude, has not proved  he  is  the  father  of
         [SB]'s child and the fact that the Respondent initially accepted he
         had a parental relationship  with  [J]  does  not  mean  I  am  not
         entitled to arrive  at  this  Decision  following  the  hearing  of
         considerable  tested  evidence   and   the   withdrawal   of   that
         concession."

92. As regards the asylum  claim,  a  number  of  reasons  were  given  for
    rejecting the credibility of that claim.  In summary, the appellant had
    had opportunities to mention his fear of return: when arrested in  2007
    for drink driving, at the time or after the incident when he  was  shot
    at in Birmingham, or at any other time in the 10 or 11 years he claimed
    to have been in the UK, including when he  was  arrested  in  2014  for
    possession of a false document and for which he received a sentence  of
    four months' imprisonment.

93. Judge Baldwin also considered it  inherently  unlikely  that  a  person
    would travel half way round the world for 25 acres of land and  risking
    imprisonment in the UK for murder or attempted  murder.   In  addition,
    the appellant's case was that the land would pass to his family on  the
    appellant's death but his family continued to live in the same  village
    in which the land is situated.   Furthermore,  although  not  attaching
    great significance to the fact that the appellant had been convicted of
    an offence of dishonesty, he concluded that  this  suggested  that  the
    appellant is not averse to using deception if it suits his aims.

94. He also concluded that in any event the  appellant  would  be  able  to
    relocate elsewhere in India even if there was a risk in his village  in
    Punjab.

    The grounds and submissions before the Upper Tribunal

95. The grounds of appeal before the Upper Tribunal concern the  withdrawal
    of the concession as to the appellant's relationship with [SB]  and  J,
    at  the  hearing  without  advance  notice  to  the  appellant  or  his
    representatives.  In essence, the grounds contend that  the  judge  was
    wrong to allow the concession to be  withdrawn  in  the  circumstances.
    The related grounds concern the consequent assessment of Article  8  in
    terms of the appellant's family life.

96. As regards the judge's decision on the asylum ground, it is  contended,
    in summary that there was a misunderstanding by the judge of the  basis
    of the appellant's claim and the evidence in support of it.

97. In submissions Ms Mallick relied on the grounds.  It was submitted that
    there were good reasons for the respondent to have made the  concession
    that she did,  having  regard  to  the  documentary  evidence  and  the
    evidence from the asylum interview.  There was no  application  for  an
    adjournment before Judge Baldwin because the appellant  was  not  in  a
    position to fund a further hearing.  It would easily have been possible
    for the respondent to have contacted the appellant's representatives in
    advance of the hearing to  indicate  that  it  was  proposed  that  the
    concession be withdrawn.  The appellant's representative's details were
    in letters sent to the respondent prior to the hearing.

98. If it had been known in advance of the hearing that it was proposed  to
    withdraw the concession, further evidence could have been obtained, for
    example from friends of the appellant and her partner  who  knew  about
    their relationship from 2008, and about  the  appellant's  relationship
    with J.  In addition, it would have been possible for DNA  evidence  to
    be sought and, if necessary, an application could have  been  made  for
    the hearing to be adjourned for that evidence to be obtained.  Although
    it was said at the hearing that the Presenting Officer  could  indicate
    later on in the  hearing,  after  the  evidence  had  been  considered,
    whether it was still intended to withdraw the concession,  the  hearing
    proceeded effectively on the footing that the  Presenting  Officer  had
    decided that the concession was to be withdrawn in any event.

99. Furthermore, in the light of the evidence  put  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, it was irrational of the judge to conclude that the appellant
    was not the natural father of J.  I was referred to the evidence  which
    it is said support that contention.  Reference was made in  submissions
    to Judge Baldwin's manuscript record of proceedings and to the notes of
    evidence, as recorded by Ms Mallick.

100. Mr Collingridge stated that according to a note or minute kept  by  the
    Presenting Officer, two reasons were given for the decision to withdraw
    the concession, one being that it was only the tenancy agreements  that
    seemed to show the relationship between the  appellant  and  [SB],  and
    secondly the appellant's name was missing from the birth certificate of
    J.  There had been no application for an adjournment on behalf  of  the
    appellant  at  the  hearing  before  Judge  Baldwin.   Mr  Collingridge
    referred to the decision in NR (Jamaica) v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 856 on the question of withdrawal of  a
    concession.  It was submitted that the First-tier Judge had endeavoured
    to achieve a fair hearing.

101. The judge had referred to the evidence in relation to  the  appellant's
    relationship and had set it out in the determination.  He accepted that
    the appellant and J are close but he considered the birth  certificate,
    and he rejected the explanations offered for why the  appellant's  name
    is not on it as the father of J.

102.  He  came  to  sustainable  conclusions  in  relation  to  whether  the
    appellant could return to India, bearing in mind that [SB] knew of  the
    appellant's immigration status when they entered in  the  relationship.
    It was also relevant to take into account  the  appellant's  offending.
    The appellant was not the primary carer for J and he had been in prison
    serving a sentence of four months' imprisonment and had therefore  been
    away from J for that time.  He went on to conclude at [25] that even if
    the appellant is J's father, J is only 3 years of age and therefore  is
    of an adaptable age.  He  concluded  that  J  and  [SB]  would  not  be
    required to leave the UK, and there was no reason as to  why  he  could
    not return to India in terms of any claimed fear from her family.

103. In reply  Ms  Mallick  referred  to  the  financial  support  that  the
    appellant had been providing to [SB] and J, a matter that had not  been
    taken into account by the judge.  The support he provided allowed  [SB]
    to be the primary carer for  J.   There  was  evidence  that  [SB]  had
    brought J to visit the appellant in prison.

104. Had it been accepted that the appellant was a  "qualifying  child"  all
    those matters would have to have been dealt with in terms of  the  best
    interests of J.







    My conclusions

105. I announced at the hearing that I was not satisfied that there was  any
    error of law in the judge's assessment of the appellant's asylum claim,
    but that I was satisfied that the judge had erred in law in relation to
    the question of the withdrawal of the  concession  by  the  respondent.
    The following are my reasons.

106. Dealing firstly with the asylum ground,  although  Ms  Mallick  focused
    her submissions on the Article 8 and concession point, she did rely  on
    the grounds in terms of the judge's assessment  of  the  asylum  claim.
    The grounds refer to [17] of the  determination,  suggesting  that  the
    judge had seemed to link the appellant being shot in Birmingham in 2005
    to [SB] and her family's disapproval of him.  It is argued  that  there
    was an error in the  judge's  understanding  of  the  appellant's  case
    because the appellant was shot by Mandeep Singh  in  the  UK  in  2005,
    being a person who was involved in the land dispute.  That had  nothing
    to do with any family disapproval by [SB]'s family  of  the  appellant.
    The grounds go on to  refer  to  [18]  of  the  determination  and  the
    reference to [SB] speaking about the shooting.  The point is made  that
    [SB] said in cross-examination that the  shooting  happened  two  years
    prior to meeting the appellant and she had only indicated that she  did
    not think they could live in their home area because of  the  risks  to
    the appellant.  This part of the grounds concludes by stating that:

         "The way that the Immigration judge records the facts in this  case
         is important as it  discloses  his  mindset,  to  assume  that  the
         shooting occurred for reasons  other  than  supporting  his  Asylum
         claim, although the converse was true to the standard the Appellant
         was required to meet [sic]."

107. I would first observe that the way the  grounds  are  drafted  is  less
    than clear.  Although I have not  quoted  it,  [2(ii)]  does  not  make
    grammatical sense and it is difficult to follow.  In any event, insofar
    as the grounds suggest that Judge Baldwin misunderstood  the  basis  of
    the appellant's claim, nothing identified in the grounds supports  that
    contention  at  all.   Indeed,  if  anything,  the  grounds  reveal   a
    misinterpretation or misunderstanding of Judge Baldwin's  recording  of
    the evidence.  It is plain from his narrative of the evidence that  was
    given, and from his findings, that he was well aware that the  shooting
    incident is said to be part of the appellant's asylum claim and nothing
    to do with his relationship with [SB].

108. Apart from anything else, the grounds fail to  take  into  account  the
    several other reasons given by the judge for rejecting the  credibility
    of the appellant's claim, and to which I have referred above.

109. I am not satisfied that there is any error of law in the assessment  of
    the appellant's asylum claim by Judge Baldwin.

110. In First-tier Judge Pullig's grant of  permission,  he  very  helpfully
    referred to two decisions in relation to the question of withdrawal  of
    concessions by the respondent.  No authorities are in fact cited in the
    grounds of appeal.  There is other authority on the  point  but  it  is
    only necessary it seems to me to refer to the decision in NR (Jamaica),
    cited above.  In particular, [12] is important.  It states as follows:

         "As Kennedy LJ makes clear, the  Tribunal  may  in  its  discretion
         permit a concession to be withdrawn if in its view  there  is  good
         reason in all the circumstances for that course to  be  taken.  Its
         discretion is wide. Its exercise  will  depend  on  the  particular
         circumstances of the case before it. Prejudice to the applicant  is
         a significant feature. So is its  absence.  Its  absence  does  not
         however mean that an application  to  withdraw  a  concession  will
         invariably be granted. Bad faith will almost certainly be fatal  to
         an application to withdraw a concession.  In  the  final  analysis,
         what is important is that as  a  result  of  the  exercise  of  its
         discretion the Tribunal is enabled to  decide  the  real  areas  of
         dispute on their merits so as to reach a result which is just  both
         to the appellant and the Secretary of State. "

111. It is apparent from this passage of the judgment by  Goldring  LJ  that
    the Tribunal has a discretion to permit a concession to be withdrawn if
    in the Tribunal's view there is good reason in  all  the  circumstances
    for that course to be taken.  In particular  what  is  said  about  the
    Tribunal's discretion being wide is to be noted.

112. The First-tier Tribunal's determination does not indicate what  reasons
    were given by the Presenting Officer for the decision to  withdraw  the
    concession.  Having said that, Ms Mallick accepted  that  reasons  were
    given, as outlined by Mr Collingridge.  It does not seem to me however,
    that the First-tier Judge did give consideration to the exercise of any
    discretion  in  terms  of  the  withdrawal  of  the   concession.    In
    particular, there is no indication of any  assessment  of  the  reasons
    given by the respondent for the decision to  withdraw  the  concession.
    In passing, it is worth pointing out that as Ms Mallick submitted,  the
    tenancy agreements and the birth certificate were  documents  that  had
    already been considered by the caseworker, and other evidence  besides,
    prior to or at the time of the writing of the refusal letter.

113. Judge Baldwin  noted  that  Ms  Mallick  had  said  that  the  intended
    withdrawal  of  the  concession  had  put  her  and  the  appellant  in
    difficulty as it might otherwise have been possible to  secure  further
    evidence had it been known that it  was  required.   He  recorded  that
    given that the appellant did not want and could not afford for the case
    to go to a second hearing, and  because  the  appellant's  partner  was
    present to give evidence about the relationship, it was agreed that the
    case should proceed.

114. Before me Ms Mallick was not entirely in agreement with the  suggestion
    that she had agreed  to  proceed  with  the  hearing,  at  least  as  I
    understood her submissions, not in the way that the hearing did in fact
    proceed.  It seems from the judge's manuscript record  of  proceedings,
    and accepted by Ms Mallick, that the issue of the concession was to  be
    reconsidered or re-assessed by the respondent's representative once the
    evidence had been considered.  Ms Mallick's point is that  the  hearing
    proceeded, at least so far as the  respondent  was  concerned,  on  the
    footing that the concession had already been  withdrawn,  indicated  by
    the extensive cross-examination of the appellant and  [SB]  as  to  the
    fine details of their knowledge of each other and their relationship.

115. It is important to bear in mind however,  that  the  concession  as  it
    appears in the refusal letter  relates  not  only  to  the  appellant's
    relationship with [SB] but also to the genuineness of,  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with, J as can be seen from [88] of  the  refusal
    letter.

116. There is no indication from the determination as to why the  respondent
    did not notify the appellant and his representatives in advance of  the
    hearing that  it  was  proposed  to  withdraw  the  concessions.  Judge
    Baldwin's manuscript record of proceedings seems to suggest that it was
    said that the respondent had not been  able  to  find  the  appellant's
    representative's details.  However, it is clear from  the  respondent's
    bundle, and correspondence in it from the  appellant's  representatives
    to the respondent, that their details were readily apparent and that it
    should easily have been possible for them  to  have  been  communicated
    with on this issue in advance of the hearing.

117. Judge Baldwin plainly had a difficult situation to  deal  with.   There
    was an important concession that the respondent wanted to withdraw  but
    the appellant's representatives did not apply for  an  adjournment  and
    indicated that the appellant would not have been able to fund a further
    hearing.  Had Judge Baldwin adjourned the hearing of  his  own  motion,
    which he was empowered to do, the consequence may have  been  that  the
    appellant would have returned unrepresented because of a lack of funds,
    which itself could arguably have given  rise  to  a  challenge  to  the
    judge's decision.  It is accepted on all sides, and is apparent to  me,
    that Judge Baldwin did indeed endeavour to ensure that the  proceedings
    were fair.

118. However,  I  am  satisfied  that  he  erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
    concession to be withdrawn.  In the first  place,  the  reasons  given,
    albeit not recorded in the determination, and as indicated to me,  were
    on any view very weak.  The  matters  referred  to  were  part  of  the
    information already before the respondent when the reasons for  refusal
    letter was written.  There was other  evidence  which  was  taken  into
    account, including  the  asylum  interview,  at  which  presumably  the
    caseworker would have had the opportunity of assessing the  appellant's
    answers.

119. Furthermore, it does not seem to me that any  satisfactory  explanation
    was given as to why the intended withdrawal of the concession  was  not
    notified  in  advance  of  the  hearing  to  the  appellant   and   his
    representatives.  There was plainly the means by which that could  have
    been done.  In addition, the allied point is that had  the  appellant's
    representatives known of this issue in advance, further evidence of the
    type to which I was referred, could potentially have been obtained.

120. Although it may be that it was agreed on behalf of the  appellant  that
    the hearing should proceed, it seems to me that there are good  grounds
    for concluding that the appellant was 'forced' into that position;  not
    of course by the judge, but by the circumstances.

121. As I have already indicated, Judge Baldwin did have a discretion as  to
    whether  to  allow  the  concession  to  be  withdrawn.   In  all   the
    circumstances, I am not satisfied that he  applied  his  mind  to  that
    discretion, or that if he did, it was in the circumstances a discretion
    that was exercised correctly on the facts.

122.  Had  it  only  been  a  concession  that  concerned  the   appellant's
    relationship  with  [SB],  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  would
    probably not require to be set  aside,  since  it  is  clear  from  the
    determination at [23] that the  judge  accepted  that  they  are  in  a
    relationship.  However, he did  not  accept  the  appellant's  parental
    relationship with J.  The very  tentative  and  incomplete  alternative
    finding evident from [25] as to the situation if the appellant was  J's
    father, does not mean that the decision need not  be  set  aside.   All
    that was said there was as follows:

         "Whether or not the Appellant is [J's] father, something which  has
         yet to be proved, I accept [J] would probably miss him but  she  is
         at 3 years of age at a very young and adaptable age."

    That plainly is  not  a  full  assessment  of  the  proportionality  of
    separating the appellant from J or an assessment of the  reasonableness
    of J going to India with the appellant.

123. Accordingly, the decision in relation to Article 8 of the ECHR  is  set
    aside.

124. It is not appropriate for the matter to be remitted to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for the re-making  of  the  decision,  in  the  light  of  the
    relatively limited scope of the  further  hearing  required.   The  re-
    making will therefore take place in the Upper Tribunal on a date to  be
    notified.

125. After hearing submissions from the parties, I  also  decided  that  the
    appeal should no longer be subject to the fast track  procedure.   This
    is because of the indication of the further evidence that may be called
    on behalf of the appellant, possibly including  an  independent  social
    worker's report.  A fundamental issue at  stake  in  the  appeal  is  a
    child's best interests and in  the  circumstances  of  this  case  that
    assessment and the potential evidence that may be needed  to  make  the
    assessment, means that on the fact of this  case,  the  appeal  is  not
    appropriately retained within fast track.

126. The findings of fact made by the First-tier Tribunal, except in so  far
    as they are infected by the error of law, are  to  stand.  The  parties
    must be prepared, if necessary, to  make  submissions  at  the  resumed
    hearing as to what findings of fact are to be preserved.

127. In addition, the parties are to note that  although  I  have  concluded
    that the First-tier judge  erred  in  allowing  the  concession  to  be
    withdrawn, that does not mean that the  respondent  is  prevented  from
    seeking to withdraw the concession at the resumed hearing. However,  it
    is evident from my analysis above that if it is sought to withdraw  the
    concession, this must be done on a proper footing. In reality the issue
    only arises in terms of the  appellant's  relationship  with  J,  since
    Judge Baldwin found that the appellant and [SB] are in a relationship.

128. The directions below reflect the oral directions given to  the  parties
    at the hearing.

                                 DIRECTIONS

 1. Any further evidence to be relied on by either party is to be filed and
    served no later than 7 days before the next date of hearing.

 2. If it is proposed by either party  to  call  a  witness  to  give  oral
    evidence, there must be a witness statement drawn in sufficient  detail
    to stand as evidence-in-chief, such that  there  is  no  need  for  any
    examination-in-chief beyond the adopting of the witness statement.

 3. A skeleton argument on behalf of the  appellant  is  to  be  filed  and
    served no later than 7 days before the next date of hearing.





Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no report  of  these
proceedings shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  child  J.   This
direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.   Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
