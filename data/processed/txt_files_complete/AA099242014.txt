                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs S Farrell, of Peter G Farrell, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss S Aitken, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This determination should be read along  with  the  decision  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Dawson and Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Hutchinson, dated
    18th September  2015,  setting  aside  a  determination  by  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Burns,  promulgated  on  19th  February  2015,   which
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  respondent's  refusal  of
    asylum on 6th November 2014.

 2. The UT's decision of 18th September 2015 at paragraph 16 noted the lack
    of country information "needed to decide what the risks  are  faced  by
    members of the SDF at the present time (the relevant  country  guidance
    case having been decided in 2007) and more pertinently  the  risks,  if
    any, faced by family members of those involved with SDF".  Paragraph 19
    directed parties to file no later than fourteen days before the resumed
    hearing updated bundles to include any background  country  information
    which might address the issues identified at  paragraph  16.   Skeleton
    arguments were also to be provided.

 3. Neither party provided a skeleton argument.

 4. There was filed on behalf of the appellant an inventory of  productions
    which incorporates relevant materials from previous hearings.  Included
    are the US State Department Report on Cameroon for 2013,  published  on
    27th February 2014, and  the  US  State  Department  Report  for  2014,
    published on 21st June 2015.  It was common ground  that  there  is  no
    significant difference between those two reports.  The  appellant  also
    provides a news report of 25th May 2015 from Voice of America, entitled
    "Cameroon opposition party [the SDF] celebrates 25th anniversary", 25th
    May 2015.  This relates that from a total  of  43  in  the  180  member
    parliament in 1997, the number of SDF seats has  dropped  to  16.   The
    party celebrates "the liberty and freedom of speech it has  brought  to
    Cameroon  since  its  creation  in  1990".   It  also  criticises   its
    leadership for its relative decline.

 5. Mrs Farrell explained that she had been unable to obtain any more up-to-
    date information about the situation in Cameroon  for  members  of  and
    associates with the SDF.  An expert had been identified from the School
    of African Studies in London, but she  had  indicated  about  ten  days
    prior to the hearing that due to unexpected  family  circumstances  she
    was unable to complete her report in time.  Mrs Farrell had asked  when
    the expert might be able  to  complete  her  report  or  if  she  could
    nominate anyone else in a position to do so, but she had  no  response.
    Mrs Farrell sought an adjournment.

 6. The respondent said that the appellant had had ample time  to  prepare,
    and did not agree to an adjournment.

 7. I declined to adjourn.  The appellant has had a long time  to  prepare.
    Although the country guidance is eight years old,  if  there  were  any
    greater difficulties arising from  SDF  membership  it  should  not  be
    difficult to find evidence without the assistance  of  an  expert  from
    generally available reports by human  rights  and  news  organisations.
    The appellant's representatives have  been  able  to  find  some  quite
    specific information (after mentioned) bearing  on  her  case,  without
    expert involvement.  There was no indication that even if a delay  were
    to be permitted a report might be available, or  any  indication  of  a
    timetable.  In the circumstances, it was appropriate to  determine  the
    case on available evidence.

 8. FK (SDF member/activist - risk) Cameroon  CG  [2007]  UKAIT  00047  was
    promulgated on 21st May 2007.  The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal held
    thus:

         "In the light of the evidence currently available, membership of or
         actual or perceived involvement  with  the  SDF  at  any  level  is
         unlikely by itself to give rise to a real risk of persecution;  but
         some prominent and active opponents of the Government  in  Cameroon
         may, depending  on  their  particular  profile  and  circumstances,
         continue to be at risk."

 9. The appellant says that her father was a police officer in Cameroon and
    at the same time a member of the SDF, which the  Government  prohibits.
    She first became aware of problems in this respect around  the  end  of
    2011 and early 2012, when there was  hostility  in  the  neighbourhood.
    The Government issued a warrant dated 5th June 2013 for the  arrest  of
    her father for "active  participation  in  political  meetings  of  the
    opposition party, which officers  of  the  National  Police  Force  are
    forbidden by law to do".   This appears to have been issued by post, to
    the family  household;  a  copy  and  translation  are  produced.   The
    appellant's father continued to go to work (or at least  to  leave  the
    house in the morning and return in the evening).  On a  date  early  in
    February 2013 the military came to the house at around  2.00  a.m.  and
    took him away.  Within 2 days the appellant and her mother had to  move
    out of the police house in Douala where they  had  lived.   Her  mother
    took her to a village "quite far away", called Yabassi.  She  had  been
    studying biochemistry at university, but had to stop attending.  In the
    village a man aged about 70 wished to take the appellant as his  fourth
    wife.  He threatened that if refused he would  tell  the  police  where
    they were hiding.  This man ill-treated the appellant  by  cutting  her
    hair and rubbing a hot stone against her breasts.  Her mother took  her
    to Douala saying they were going to buy  her  wedding  dress,  but  the
    following day they went to the airport and travelled to the  UK.   They
    stayed with her brother in Scotland,  where  he  was  a  student.   Her
    mother returned to Cameroon.  The appellant sought asylum.

10. The claim based on the risk that the appellant might become a victim of
    forced marriage has properly been abandoned in course  of  proceedings.
    This is not because the appellant now says that part of her account  is
    untrue, but because although  there  is  background  evidence  of  such
    practices against young girls in Cameroon, such risk could  be  avoided
    by internal relocation.

11. The appellant now claims to be at risk of persecution on the basis only
    of imputed political opinion.

12. That claim fails even "taken at highest".  There is no evidence,  apart
    from the appellant's rather vague statement, to support the  contention
    that children of police officers who voted for opposition parties  were
    kidnapped by the Government.  I consider that if such events took place
    and were reported in the news in Cameroon, as she says,  those  reports
    would have been before the tribunal.  There is no evidence  to  support
    the proposition that the appellant might be of adverse interest to  the
    Government for  her  association  with  the  SDF  through  her  father.
    Notably, on her own account, her travel to the UK was  not  principally
    based on such fear.  The main reason  that  she  gave  for  her  mother
    taking her here was to escape the proposed forced marriage.

13. In any event, I did not find the appellant's evidence persuasive,  even
    to the lower standard of proof, for the following reasons.

14.  The  search  carried  out  by  the  appellant's  representatives   for
    background  evidence  helped  her  on  two  points.   Item  3  of   the
    appellant's  inventory  is  excerpted  from  the  Cameroon   Government
    website, where legislation is published.  Decree 2001/065,  12th  March
    2001, on the special status of civil servants provides  by  Article  29
    that members of the police force are not permitted to join "any  groups
    or associations which are political in nature".  Article  30  prohibits
    participation in meetings which are political in nature.  Under Article
    135(1) detention under a judicial  warrant  brings  about  a  temporary
    cessation of employment, and entails a loss of salary for the  detained
    employee, but with the exception of family benefits.  This  effectively
    counters the point made by  the  respondent  at  paragraph  19  of  her
    decision, that evidence of payment of the  salary  of  the  appellant's
    father into his bank account up until 29th July 2013  was  inconsistent
    with the claim that he had been detained.   The  appellant  also  cites
    relevant background information on forced  marriage  and  the  cultural
    practice of suppressing young girls' breasts (although this  aspect  of
    retarding female development is not particularly  consistent  with  the
    same man's interest in her for marriage).

15. Those features were in the appellant's favour.  However,  I  found  her
    evidence generally weak, evasive and inconsistent.   For  example,  she
    variously said that she became aware that the intention of the trip  to
    Douala was not to buy a wedding dress (a)  in  Douala;  (b)  en  route,
    Brussels; and (c) once in the UK.  She said that  she  and  her  mother
    fled to Yabassi and remained there from around January  to  July  2013,
    yet her mother was still being paid her full salary as a nurse up until
    July 2013.  The appellant is recorded as having applied for a  visa  in
    person at the High Commission in Yaound�  on  30th  July  2013,  having
    previously been granted a visit visa which she did not  use,  but  says
    she  knew  nothing  about  the  second  application.   This  cannot  be
    explained away.  The appellant is caught out by the part of  her  story
    where she says she did not know that she was going to the UK, which  in
    turn forces her to deny the obvious fact  of  her  visit  of  the  High
    Commission.  She contradicts herself over  whether  her  mother  stayed
    with her in the UK for only two or three days or for a month;  a  minor
    matter,  but  another  adverse  sign.   She  could  give  no   sensible
    explanation of why she has no further knowledge  of  her  mother  since
    parting from her in the UK, why her brother would not wish her  to  try
    to communicate with her mother, or why her brother did  not  attend  to
    give evidence as a witness.  Of course he  was  not  in  Cameroon  when
    claimed events took place, but evidence in tribunal proceedings is  not
    only  first  hand.   He  must  have  been  able   to   explain   family
    circumstances and communications among  family  members.   He  made  an
    asylum  claim  also  arising  from  their  father's  claimed  political
    problems but it was refused,  although  he  was  granted  discretionary
    leave to remain (apparently on the basis of having a partner here and a
    UK citizen child).   There  is  no  sensible  explanation  of  why  the
    Government would post an arrest warrant to the appellant's  father  and
    follow this up by arresting him in the early hours at home  some  three
    or four weeks later.  There would be no  reason  to  give  him  advance
    notice.  He could easily be found without warning him in advance either
    at his home or at his regular place of work.

16. The appellant is young and  was  a  minor  when  she  provided  initial
    information, but she is highly intelligent.  She took her school  final
    exams early and commenced university studies in biochemistry at the age
    of 15.  The reason her story made little sense was not because she  was
    at any disadvantage in telling it.

17. In summary: on the most charitable view of the appellant's evidence, it
    does not support her case of  risk  on  account  of  imputed  political
    opinion on return to Cameroon.  Her appeal  therefore  fails.   In  any
    event, her account is not a reliable one, even to the lower standard of
    proof.

18. Neither party addressed me on the question of an  anonymity  order,  so
    the one which has been made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  remains  in
    place.

19. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal, as explained  above,  has
    been set aside.  The  reasons  for  doing  so  should  be  read  as  if
    incorporated  herein.   The  following  decision  is  substituted:  the
    appellant's appeal, as originally brought to the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    is dismissed on all available grounds.
