                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. C Avery;  Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a  decision
       by First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll promulgated on 6th October 2015
       in which he allowed an appeal against the respondent's  decision  of
       18th August 2014 to refuse the application made  by  the  respondent
       for  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM  of   the
       Immigration Rules.


    2. The appellant is the Entry Clearance Officer,  and the respondent  to
       this appeal, is Mr Dwayne Faulknor.  However for ease  of  reference,
       in the course of this decision I shall adopt the parties'  status  as
       it was before the First-tier Tribunal.  I  shall  in  this  decision,
       refer to Mr Faulknor  as  the  appellant,  and  the  Entry  Clearance
       Officer as the respondent.


    3. There was no appearance before me, by or on behalf of the  appellant.
       A letter was faxed to the Tribunal by Global  Immigration  Solutions,
       on 13th April 2016  in  which  it  is  stated  that  they  have  been
       instructed that "... Mr Faulknor no  longer  wishes  to  pursue  this
       appeal,  and  accordingly  we  will  not  be  attending  the  hearing
       scheduled for tomorrow, 14 April 2016".  A letter in reply  was  sent
       to Global Immigration Solutions by fax informing them that  "...  the
       appeal being considered is that of the Home Office ...".  The  letter
       from the Tribunal makes it clear that the appeal cannot therefore  be
       withdrawn and the hearing will proceed in the absence of Mr Faulknor.
        The appellant and or his representatives are plainly  aware  of  the
       hearing and are aware that the matter will be heard in their  absence
       if they do not attend.


    4. By way of background, on 3rd April 2014  the  appellant  applied  for
       entry clearance under  paragraph  EC-P.1.1  of  Appendix  FM  to  the
       Immigration Rules.  That was in fact the second application  made  by
       the appellant.  A previous application made in January 2011 had  been
       refused, and First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson  dismissed  an  appeal
       against that refusal in February 2012.


    5. The application made on 3rd April 2014 was refused  for  the  reasons
       set out in a Refusal of Entry Clearance decision  dated  18th  August
       2014.  Broadly put, the respondent accepted that  the  appellant  did
       not fall foul of the suitability requirements and accepted  that  the
       relationship requirements were met.  The respondent was not satisfied
       that the appellant met  the  income  threshold  requirement  and  the
       related evidential requirements  set  out  in  Appendix  FM-SE.   The
       respondent set out the evidential requirements and concluded that not
       all of the specified evidence had been provided  in  support  of  the
       application.


    6. The appellant appealed and the Entry Clearance Manager  reviewed  the
       decision.  The decision to refuse the application was maintained  for
       the reasons set out in the Entry Clearance Manager's decision of 11th
       February 2015.


The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll


    7. The First-tier Tribunal Judge set out at paragraphs [1] to [4],  the
       background.  He records that she heard the evidence of  the  sponsor
       who adopted the contents of her  witness  statement.   At  paragraph
       [6], the Judge states:


           "It is not disputed by the appellant that he is unable  to  meet
           all the requirements of Appendix FM with regard to the specified
           evidence but it is, nevertheless, his case that the  sponsor  is
           generating a personal income in excess of  the  minimum  earning
           threshold of �18,600."


    8. At paragraph [8] of the decision, the Judge states:


           "I am satisfied, in the light of all of the evidence  before  me
           that, in the financial year which  relates  to  the  application
           giving rise to the decision under appeal,  the  sponsor  had  an
           overall gross annual income of �23,550, substantially in  excess
           of that required by Appendix FM.  That income is  not,  however,
           shown in the sponsor's personal bank statements.  Mr  Allen,  on
           behalf of the appellant, drew my attention  to  the  Immigration
           Directorate Instructions at Annex FM1.7, specifically  paragraph
           3.2.1, as follows...."


           ....


           In the case of this appellant, I am satisfied that  his  sponsor
           meets the level of the specified financial requirement and  that
           the presence of the appellant in the  United  Kingdom  will  not
           place any burden upon the public purse"


    9. The findings made by the Judge in that paragraph are far from clear.
        It seems that the Judge accepts that the evidential requirements in
       Appendix FM-SE are not met, but finds that the sponsor has  a  gross
       annual income of �23,500.   That  being  in  excess  of  the  income
       threshold set out in Appendix FM.


   10. The Judge went on at paragraph [11] to state:


           "The genuineness of the relationship between the  appellant  and
           the sponsor  is  not  in  dispute.  They  enjoy  a  family  life
           together. The sponsor has a well-established private life in the
           United Kingdom.  She works as a  senior  practitioner  in  child
           protection issues. Her work commitments mean  that  she  is  not
           able to travel  on  a  regular  basis  to  Jamaica  to  see  the
           appellant, quite apart from cost considerations. In the light of
           all of the evidence, I am satisfied that her income exceeds  the
           minimum threshold requirement and I find that  the  respondent's
           decision under appeal gives rise to a disproportionate breach of
           the Article 8 rights of the appellant and the sponsor."


   11.  It would seem that  the  Judge  therefore  allowed  the  appeal  on
       Article 8 grounds.  Whether the appeal was also  allowed  under  the
       Immigration Rules is not clear.


 The grounds of appeal


   12. The respondent advances three grounds  of  appeal.    First,  having
       concluded that the appellant  and  his  sponsor  have  not  met  the
       evidential requirements set out in appendix FM-SE, the  Judge  erred
       in  law  in  allowing  the  appeal  on  article  8  grounds  without
       identifying the "compelling circumstances"  that justify  the  grant
       of leave to enter where the requirements of  the  immigration  rules
       are not met.  In any event the  Judge  has  had  no  regard  to  the
       statutory duty to consider the matters is set out in  s117B  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


   13. Second, in reaching her decision as to the sponsor's  earnings,  the
       Judge failed to consider the matters set out in the decision of  the
       Entry Clearance Manager, and does not identify the withdrawals  made
       from the corporate bank account of the Company, by way of  drawings,
       wages and dividends for the sponsor's own use.


   14. Third, the Judge failed to give reasons why he  found  at  paragraph
       [11] that the respondent's decision under appeal  gives  rise  to  a
       disproportionate  breach  of  the  Article  8  rights  of  both  the
       appellant and the sponsor.


   15. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade
       on 7th March 2016.  The matter comes before me to  consider  whether
       or not the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Carroll  involved
       the making of a material error of law, and  if  so,  to  remake  the
       decision.


 Discussion


   16. It is useful to begin by setting out  the  relevant  requirements  of
       Appendix FM-SE:


         Evidence of Financial Requirements under Appendix FM


         A1. To meet the financial requirement under paragraphs  E-ECP.3.1.,
         E-LTRP.3.1.,  E-ECC.2.1.  and  E-LTRC.2.1.  of  Appendix  FM,   the
         applicant must meet:


               .             (a)  The  level   of   financial   requirement
                 applicable to the application under Appendix FM; and


               .            (b) The requirements specified in  Appendix  FM
                 and this Appendix as to:


                     .        (i)  The  permitted  sources  of  income   and
                       savings;


                       (ii) The time periods and permitted  combinations  of
sources                                 applicable to each permitted  source
relied upon; and


                       (iii) The evidence required for each permitted source
         relied upon.


   17. As I have set out, at paragraph  [6]  of  his  decision,  the  Judge
       states:


           "It is not disputed by the appellant that he is unable  to  meet
           all the requirements of Appendix FM with regard to the specified
           evidence..."


   18. The First-tier Tribunal Judge concludes at paragraph [8] that  he  is
       satisfied that  the  appellant  meets  the  level  of  the  specified
       financial requirement.  Having made that finding, it is not  entirely
       clear whether the Judge allowed  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
       Rules.  If he did, in my judgement the Judge erred by not  adequately
       considering the evidential requirements of Appendix  FM-SE.   If  the
       Judge allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules, the Judge erred
       in  allowing  the  appeal  having  concluded  that  the   substantive
       maintenance requirement was met simply by reference to  his  analysis
       of the evidence before him as to  the  sponsor's  income.   In  those
       circumstances, if the appeal has been allowed under  the  immigration
       rules, in my judgement there is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the decision is set aside.


   19. In any event, the Judge wen on to consider the appeal on  Article  8
       grounds, and it is plain from what is said at  paragraph  [11]  that
       the Judge found that the  respondent's  decision  gives  rise  to  a
       disproportionate breach of the Article 8 rights of the appellant and
       the sponsor.


   20. The relevance of an appellant's  inability  to  meet  the  evidential
       requirements and the approach to Article 8 in light of  Appendix  FM-
       SE, was considered by the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA
       Civ 387.  Their Lordships held:


             "50.       The present appeals concern not only the LTE  Rules
             in Appendix FM which set out the substantive conditions  which
             have to  be  satisfied  in  relation  to  the  minimum  income
             requirements for a sponsor, but also the Rules in Appendix FM-
             SE  which  stipulate  the  form  of   evidence   required   to
             substantiate   claims   that   the    substantive    financial
             requirements under Appendix FM have been met.  Appendix  FM-SE
             deals with matters such  as  the  types  of  bank  statements,
             payslips, income, savings and so forth which will be  regarded
             as acceptable. In addition, section A1.1(b) states,  "Promises
             of third party support will not be accepted",  and  stipulates
             the  highly  circumscribed  forms  which  support  from  third
             parties is required to take.


             51.  In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in  the  light
             of the Rules in Appendix  FM-SE  should  be  the  same  as  in
             respect of the substantive LTE and LTR Rules in  Appendix  FM.
             In other  words,  the  same  general  position  applies,  that
             compelling circumstances would have  to  apply  to  justify  a
             grant of LTE or LTR where the evidence Rules are not  complied
             with.


             52  This is for two principal  reasons.  First,  the  evidence
             rules have the  same  general  objective  as  the  substantive
             rules, namely to limit the risk that someone is admitted  into
             the United  Kingdom  and  then  becomes  a  burden  on  public
             resources, and the Secretary of State  has  the  same  primary
             function in relation to them, to assess the risk  and  put  in
             place measures which are judged suitable to contain it  within
             acceptable bounds. Similar  weight  should  be  given  to  her
             assessment of  what  the  public  interest  requires  in  both
             contexts.


             53  Secondly, enforcement of the evidence rules  ensures  that
             everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and fairly
             in relation to the evidential requirements they must  satisfy.
             As  well  as  keeping  the  costs  of  administration   within
             reasonable  bounds,  application  of  standard  rules  is   an
             important  means  of  minimising   the   risk   of   arbitrary
             differences in treatment of  cases  arising  across  the  wide
             range of officials, tribunals and courts which administer  the
             system of immigration controls. In this regard,  the  evidence
             Rules (like the substantive Rules) serve  as  a  safeguard  in
             relation to rights of  applicants  and  family  members  under
             Article 14 to equal treatment within the scope of Article 8  :
             compare AJ (Angola) , above, at [40], and Huang  ,  above,  at
             [16] ("There will, in almost  any  case,  be  certain  general
             considerations to bear in  mind:  the  general  administrative
             desirability  of  applying  known  rules  if   a   system   of
             immigration control is to be workable, predictable, consistent
             and fair as between one applicant and another; the  damage  to
             good administration and  effective  control  if  a  system  is
             perceived by applicants internationally to be  unduly  porous,
             unpredictable or  perfunctory;  ...  the  need  to  discourage
             fraud, deception and deliberate breaches of the law; and so on
             ..."). Good reason would need to be  shown  why  a  particular
             applicant was entitled to  more  preferential  treatment  with
             respect to evidence than  other  applicants  would  expect  to
             receive under the Rules. Moreover, in relation to  the  proper
             administration of immigration controls, weight should also  be
             given to the Secretary of State's assessment of the evidential
             requirements needed to ensure prompt and fair  application  of
             the substantive Rules: compare Stec v United Kingdom  ,  cited
             at para. [15] above. Again, if an  applicant  says  that  they
             should be given more preferential treatment  with  respect  to
             evidence than the Rules allow  for,  and  more  individualised
             consideration of their case, good reason should be put forward
             to justify that."


   21. The reason that the appellant does not fulfill  the  requirements  of
       the Immigration Rules is because the evidential requirements set  out
       in Appendix FM-SE are not met  sufficiently  to  establish  that  the
       substantive  maintenance   requirement   is   met.    No   compelling
       circumstances are referred to, by the Judge to  justify  a  grant  of
       leave to enter where the Immigration Rules are not complied with.


   22. In my judgment, the  Judge  has  given  inadequate  reasons  for  his
       conclusion  that  the  respondent's  decision   gives   rise   to   a
       disproportionate breach of the Article 8 rights of the appellant  and
       the sponsor.  I set out below the head note  in  Budhathoki  (reasons
       for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC);


           "It  is  generally  unnecessary  and  unhelpful  for  First-tier
           Tribunal judgments to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a
           case.  This leads to judgments becoming overly long and confused
           and is not a proportionate approach to deciding cases.   It  is,
           however, necessary  for  judges  to  identify  and  resolve  key
           conflicts in the evidence and explain in clear and  brief  terms
           their reasons, so that the parties can understand why  they  won
           or lost."


   23. This amounts to an error  of  law.   The  judge  has  not  adequately
       explained his reasons, so that the respondent can understand why,  in
       the  absence  of  any  compelling   circumstances   identified,   the
       respondent's decision gives rise to a disproportionate breach of  the
       Article 8 rights of the appellant and the sponsor.  The appellant  is
       required to demonstrate good  reason  why  he  is  entitled  to  more
       preferential treatment with  respect  to  the  evidence,  than  other
       applicants would expect to receive under the Rules.  No such  reasons
       were advanced  or  identified  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.


   24. Whether the appeal has been allowed under the immigration rules,  and
       upon Article 8 grounds, or  upon  Article  8  grounds  alone,  in  my
       judgement there is a material error of law in  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal and the decision is set aside.


Remaking the decision


   25. The appellant has failed to take part in the hearing before  me.   It
       was conceded by the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal that the
       evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE are not  met.   The  appeal
       under the Immigration Rules fails and is dismissed.


   26. Insofar as Article 8 is concerned, looking at the matter through  the
       five Razgar questions, I would answer them therefore as follows.  (1)
       There is no question of a proposed removal in this case, but only  of
       whether the appellant is to be given leave to enter. Plainly  refusal
       of such leave is an interference with the exercise of  the  right  to
       respect for the appellant and his  sponsor's  family  life.  (2)  The
       interference will have consequences of such gravity as potentially to
       engage the operation of article 8. (3) Such interference would be  in
       accordance with law, namely pursuant to  the  applicable  immigration
       rules (subject of course to the ultimate outcome  of  the  article  8
       issue).  (4)  and  (5)   These   questions   of   justification   and
       proportionality are, often taken together. As Strasbourg and domestic
       jurisprudence has consistently emphasised,  states  are  entitled  to
       have regard to their system of immigration control and its  generally
       consistent application, and a requirement that an entrant should meet
       the maintenance requirement  is  an  ultimately  fair  and  necessary
       limitation on what would otherwise  become  a  possibly  overwhelming
       burden on all of its citizens.


   27. For the reasons that I have already set out above, in  my  judgement,
       the appellant has failed to  establish  that  there  are  other  non-
       standard  and  particular  features  of  the  case,  that  are  of  a
       compelling nature to show that the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  is
       disproportionate to the legitimate aim of immigration control.


   28. s117 Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is also a factor  to
       be taken  into  account  in  determining  proportionality.   s117A(2)
       requires me to have regard  to  the considerations listed in sections
       117B and 117C. I am conscious of my statutory   duty  to  take  these
       factors into account when coming to my  conclusions.  Maintenance  of
       fair and effective immigration control is  in  the  public  interest.
       Similarly, it is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
       interests of the economic well-being  of  the  United  Kingdom,  that
       persons who seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
       financially independent, because such persons are  not  a  burden  on
       taxpayers, and are better able to integrate into society.


   29. In my judgement, the reason that the appellant is unable  to  satisfy
       the requirement of the immigration rules is relevant  to  the  public
       interest matters that I am  required  to  take  into  account  in  an
       assessment of proportionality.  In the absence of any  countervailing
       factors weighing in favour of the  appellant,  in  my  judgement  the
       refusal of entry clearance does  not  result  in  a  disproportionate
       interference with the applicant and her sponsor's right to  a  family
       life.


   30. The appeal on Article 8 grounds is therefore dismissed.


 Notice of Decision


   31. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  I  remake  the
       decision and the appeal is dismissed both under the Immigration Rules
       and on Article 8 grounds.


   32. No anonymity direction is applied for and none is made.

Signed                                             Date

FEE AWARD


As I have set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  dismissed
the appeal there can be no fee award.
