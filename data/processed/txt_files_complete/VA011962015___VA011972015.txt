For the Respondents:   Miss W M Smith, Sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer Accra appeals against the determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge M P  W  Harris  promulgated  on  3  May  2016
    allowing the appeals of  Michael  Kwabena  Oppong   and  his  daughter,
    Debora, against the refusal of the Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  grant
    them entry clearance as visitors  The sponsor, their sponsor,  is  Miss
    Winora Smith who appeared before me. For the purpose  of  continuity  I
    shall refer to Mr Michael Oppong s the appellant as he was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  For a reason which is not entirely clear to me it
    was the daughter, Debora, who is named as the first appellant.  She was
    born on 29 November 1999.

 2. The matter arises from the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer.  I
    need only refer to the decision as it related to the appellant  because
    his daughter's claim flows  from  it.  The  decision-maker,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, said this:

         "On the basis of the evidence provided, your fianc�e is in  the  UK
         and you appear to have little in the  way  of  personal  income  or
         assets in your own country. In light of all the  above  I  consider
         that you have failed to show sufficiently strong family, social  or
         economic ties to satisfy me on the balance  of  probabilities  that
         you intend to leave the United Kingdom on  completion  of  a  short
         visit.

         Given the  statements  that  you  have  made  and  the  documentary
         evidence that you have presented to support your application  I  am
         not satisfied that your circumstances in Ghana  coupled  with  your
         reasons for wishing to travel to the UK  are  such  that  you  have
         shown your intentions are as stated or that you intend to leave the
         UK at the end of your proposed  visit,.  Therefore  on  balance  of
         probabilities I am not satisfied that  you  are  genuinely  seeking
         entry as a visitor for a limited period not exceeding six months or
         that you intend to leave the United Kingdom  at  the  end  of  your
         visit as required by paragraph 41(i) and (ii) of HC 395."

 3. It follows from what I have said  that  the  decision  maker  made  two
    discrete and separate findings. First, that he or she was not satisfied
    that the appellant had  sufficient ties with Ghana  to  prompt  him  to
    return and, secondly, that he was not satisfied that he was  a  genuine
    visitor and that he intended to leave at the conclusion of  the  visit.
    Clearly the underlying finding made by the Entry Clearance Officer  was
    that the appellant was seeking entry clearance as a  spouse  or  fianc�
    and that he would remain in the United Kingdom rather than returning as
    he would do if he were a genuine visitor.

 4. The matter has this curious gloss placed upon it by reason of the  fact
    that there is no appeal against the paragraph 41  decision  itself.  In
    other words the question of whether the appellant met the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules is not the evidential focus.  The  reason  for
    this is that there is no such appeal against the paragraph 41  decision
    and the appeal has to be  couched  in  terms  of  a  violation  of  the
    appellant's rights under Article 8 which is permissible by  way  of  an
    appeal to the Tribunal.

 5. It follows from this that the First-tier Tribunal Judge was required to
    make findings as to  the  nature  of  the  relationship  which  existed
    between the appellant and the sponsor and also had to make findings  as
    to whether this was a genuine visit  planned  or  whether  it  was  the
    fraudulent evasion of immigration control by seeking to settle  in  the
    United Kingdom as a spouse or as a fianc� without  complying  with  the
    requirements in that capacity and using a visit visa as a cloak to hide
    the deception.

 6. If the judge found that this was not a genuine claim then  there  would
    be an overwhelming public interest in refusing entry clearance and  the
    proportionality of the decision would undoubtedly favour the  Secretary
    of State.  Conversely, if the First-tier Tribunal Judge concluded  that
    this was an entirely genuine application by the appellant as a proposed
    visitor and that he would leave at the conclusion  of  the  visit  then
    there was little or nothing by way of public interest to weigh  against
    the inevitably genuine intention of an individual to come and  visit  a
    person with whom he is emotionally involved.

 7. So I am looking to see whether or not the First-tier Tribunal Judge was
    right in approaching the case as he did in Article 8 terms.

 8. The conclusion that he reached is based on a process of reasoning which
    I can extract from paragraphs 16 onwards of the determination:

         "16.     The [appellant's] case is that  he  and  the  sponsor  are
             fianc�s. The respondent in the notice of decision and the  ECM
             review does [not] raise  any detailed challenge to this claim.



         17.  The sponsor told me at  the  hearing  that  it  had  now  been
             arranged for her and the [appellant] to  undergo  a  customary
             marriage ceremony Ghana over the course of 29 and 30  December
             2016.  The sponsor confirmed that by the date of the decisions
             in these appeals the date for the marriage had  not  yet  been
             arranged. Thus as the setting of the date  for  marriage  took
             place after the date of decision, this is  a  new  development
             which  I find that in law I cannot take into account.

         18.  However, I find that I can accept the sponsor's evidence  that
             se and the appellant, having originally met in  December  2010
             in Ghana and after a number of further visits over  the  years
             to Ghana by the sponsor along with regular contact  by  phone,
             had by 2014 reached a stage in their relationship  where  they
             had agreed they both wanted  to  marry  one  another  and  the
             [appellant] was having to  arrange  traditional  pre  marriage
             matters such as a bride price."

 9. It was on this basis  that  the  judge  found  that  the  couple  could
    properly be called fianc�s.   He also went on to find that  the  nature
    of the relationship was that there was mutual emotional dependency  and
    intimacy such as to engage Article 8.

10. The judge then went on to cite some examples of that.  In particular it
    was noted that the appellant's daughter had  reached  a  stage  in  the
    relationship that she was  addressing  her  prospective  stepmother  as
    'mother' and that the relationship between both the  daughter  and  the
    sponsor and the appellant was such as there was family life between the
    three of them.  It is true that it was a family life that was going  to
    develop further when the parties were living together as  would  happen
    in due course but  it  was  nevertheless  a  relationship  which  might
    properly  be  considered  as  forming   part   of   the   family   life
    consideration.

11. Accordingly the judge went on to find that the  decision  made  by  the
    respondent to refuse entry clearance was sufficient to  engage  Article
    8.  He said:

      "The  interference  is  more  than  simply  technical  and  does  have
         consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation
         of Article 8."

     He therefore went on  to  consider  whether  the  interference  was  in
    accordance with the law and necessary within Article 8(2).

12.  Having  done  so,  he  then  moved  on  to  consider  the   issue   of
    proportionality.  In doing  so  he  found  in  paragraph  28  that  the
    evidence of the sponsor was credible and that the appellant had  worked
    for many years as a woodcarver and was paid in cash, that  the  sponsor
    had physically visited the appellant's workshop in the  past  and  they
    talked about opening a bank account which was used for  savings  rather
    than the deposit of regular earnings.  The  judge  found  that  it  was
    credible that the appellants' plan was to make relatively brief  visits
    to the United Kingdom and, in particular,  these  were  to  take  place
    either side of a trip to the Dominican Republic when there was going to
    a nephew's wedding.  The judge made findings as  to  where  the  couple
    would live once they had been married and he  was  reassured  that  the
    appellant had established ties to Ghana and would  not  be  looking  to
    overstay in the United Kingdom.

13. In those circumstances he had found that the Entry Clearance  Officer's
    decision was not one that he was prepared to uphold on the  facts.   He
    found that the appellant did have adequate ties  with  Ghana  and,  not
    only that, he was intending to return to Ghana at the conclusion of the
    visit.

14. Those  findings  inevitably  were  such  that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 41 albeit that this was not an appeal against
    the paragraph 41 decision but was a human rights claim.   He  therefore
    concluded that, bearing in mind the requirements of  paragraph  41  had
    been met,  it  was  disproportionate  to  refuse  the  appellant  entry
    clearance under the provisions of Article 8.

15. In my judgement that was an appeal which was properly open to the judge
    on hearing this appeal.  He heard the  evidence  of  the  sponsor.  The
    sponsor attended before me.  He was not  satisfied that  anything  that
    had been put forward on  behalf  of  the  respondent  was  adequate  to
    dislodge his own findings as to the genuineness of  this  relationship.
    It is argued by  Miss  Fijiwala,  on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, that the case of Kaur (Visit appeals; Article 8)  [2015]  UKUT
    487 (IAC) is relevant in this  case.  That  was  a  decision  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Storey and Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Bagral.  In  that
    decision it is said

         "In visit appeals the Article 8 decision on  an  appeal  cannot  be
         made in a vacuum. Whilst judges only have  jurisdiction  to  decide
         whether the decision is unlawful  under  section  6  of  the  Human
         Rights Act 1988 or shows  unlawful  discrimination,...the  starting
         point for deciding that must be the state  of  evidence  about  the
         appellant's ability to meet the requirements of paragraph 41 of the
         immigration rules."

16. In my judgement that was exactly the approach that was adopted  by  the
    judge who found that those  Rules  had  been  met.   In  addition  Miss
    Fijiwala seeks to rely on the case of Adjei (visit visas -  Article  8)
    [2015] UKUT 261 (IAC) which was a  decision  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Southern.

17. In that decision, the italicised words read:

         "The first question to be addressed in an  appeal  against  refusal
         to grant entry clearance as  a  visitor  where  only  human  rights
         grounds are available, is whether Article 8 of the ECHR is  engaged
         at all. If it is not, which will  not infrequently be the case, the
         Tribunal has no jurisdiction to embark upon an  assessment  of  the
         decision of the ECO under the Rules  and  should  not  do  so.   If
         Article 8 is engaged the Tribunal may need to look at the extent to
         which the claimant is said to have failed to meet the  requirements
         of the Rules because that may inform the  proportionality  exercise
         that must follow."

18. This was an approach that was adopted by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    in this case. He said in paragraph 23 as I have recited,  that  in  the
    circumstances of each of the appellants the interference is  more  than
    simply  technical  and  does  have  consequences  of  such  gravity  as
    potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.

19. It follows from this that the judge did have in mind that not all visit
    visas are going to engage Article 8 if there is a refusal decision made
    in relation to the application.  I can well imagine, for example,  that
    there may be an appeal where one friend wishes to visit another  friend
    and the interference to be drawn form that visiting 'right'  (if  right
    it be) is not sufficient to engage Article 8.  But  this  was  not  the
    case here and the judge recited why it was not  the  case.   He  talked
    about the nearness  of  the  relationship;  the  fact  that  they  were
    fianc�s; the  fact  that  each  had  sufficient  mutual  and  emotional
    dependence and intimacy  so  as  to  engage  Article  8  and  that  the
    appellant's daughter was also engaged in that  process,  in  the  sense
    that she was part of the family unit.

20. So on the basis of the visits that had been made; on the basis  of  the
    arrangements that had been made for the marriage, (and I am told by the
    sponsor that this was not going to be a customary marriage but would in
    fact be a customary marriage followed by registration  in  Ghana  which
    would have the effect that it would be marriage recognised in  UK  law)
    and in relation to the intention of the appellant to  comply  with  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, all of those  factors,  were  in
    favour of the finding that there was a  protected  private  and  family
    life.

21. For these reasons I find that the challenge made by  the  Secretary  of
    State is not made out and consequently I  dismiss  the  appeal  of  the
    Secretary of State in the Upper Tribunal and affirm the judgment of the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.

22. I might say something I think directly  to  the  sponsor,  Miss  Winora
    Smith, at this stage but it might form part of the judgment that  I  am
    making.  What I want to say is this.  The Immigration  Rules,  when  it
    comes to visit visas, permit a visit to take place for a period of  six
    months.  If, during that  period,  there  has  not  been  a  successful
    application made to extend leave to  remain,  your  future  husband  is
    going to be an overstayer if he does not then leave.   That  will  have
    very  grave  consequences  for  you,  and  for  him,  were  any   later
    application to be made for leave to remain.  Whilst it may seem  as  if
    it is a simple process to invite your husband to  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom and for him then  to  remain,  that  would  undoubtedly  be  an
    inadvisable step to take because, were  that  to  happen,  were  he  to
    overstay, it would gravely jeopardise any  future  application  he  may
    make as to your spouse.



DECISION

The Entry Clearance Officer's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no error  on  a  point  of  law  and  the
original determination of the appeal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
