                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms L Kenny, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Ikegwuruka, Almond Legals


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Mali.  She made an application for  entry
    clearance for the purpose of settlement in the UK as the spouse of  the
    sponsor, and stated therein that she intended to travel in the  company
    of her son. He made his own application for  entry  clearance  for  the
    purpose of settlement in the UK as the son of the sponsor, as the child
    of their marriage.  The two applications were each refused by the Entry
    Clearance Officer on 9 October 2013.

 2. In brief the Entry Clearance Officer noted that this was not the  first
    application for entry clearance that had been made by the Appellant. It
    was refused on the basis that  she  could  not  satisfy  the  financial
    requirements set out in Appendix FM. Her husband's  income  fell  below
    the stipulated threshold, and as a further ground  of  refusal  it  was
    noted that  she  had  not  produced,  and  did  not  have,  a  language
    qualification of the type specified  in  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    child's application was refused because his  mother's  application  had
    been refused.

 3. For whatever reason, only the Appellant lodged an appeal - her son  did
    not. The appeal came before Judge Cockrill on 9  October  2014  and  he
    promulgated his decision in relation to it on  16  October  2014.  That
    decision allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules,  although  the
    text of the decision makes clear that he would have  allowed  it  under
    Article 8 if he had been unable  to  allow  it  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The Respondent applied for  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  and
    permission was granted by Judge Colyer on 5 September.  So  the  matter
    comes before me.

 5. I am satisfied that Judge Cockrill fell into an error of law, indeed  a
    number of errors of law.   First,  and  perhaps  most  importantly,  he
    appears to have treated the appeal as if  it  was  an  appeal  by  both
    mother and son when it was not.  Second, he appears to have treated the
    appeal as if mother could change tack, and  post  decision  during  the
    course of the appeal require her application to be considered as if she
    had only ever  applied  for  entry  clearance  to  travel  alone.  That
    approach was not open  to  the  Appellant,  although  it  is  one  that
    continued to be pursued before me. Third, he appears to  have  reversed
    the  burden  of  proof  in  relation  to  the  English  language   test
    requirement, and to have satisfied himself (for grounds that are not at
    all clear) that the Appellant had demonstrated a  perfectly  reasonable
    grasp of English and that this was all she needed to  do  in  order  to
    meet the fluency requirement under the Rules. That approach was plainly
    wrong. Specified English language test  providers  are  listed  by  the
    Respondent and the Appellant was simply unable to show that she  had  a
    test certificate from an approved provider at the date of decision.  No
    evidence was provided to the judge to suggest that she did, and none is
    provided even now.

 6. Finally, in relation to the approach to the Immigration Rules the judge
    clearly fell into error in his approach  to  the  financial  threshold.
    Since mother and son had each applied declaring an intention to  travel
    together the sponsor needed to show a gross annual income of  at  least
    �22,400 in order to meet  the  relevant  financial  threshold,  and  he
    simply could not do so.  Indeed I note in passing, as became  clear  in
    the course of submissions to me, that there  was  no  evidence  at  all
    before the judge to show what the sponsor's income was at the  date  of
    decision.   The  last  evidence  of  any  quality  to  corroborate  his
    assertion that he did have an income of more than �22,400 was his  bank
    statement for June  2013.  That  document  demonstrated  his  financial
    position four months before the date of decision,  and  no  explanation
    was offered to the judge for why more relevant bank statements were not
    produced in evidence. The P60 to which the judge referred was  for  the
    tax year 2013; that predated the date of the decision  by  six  months.
    Again no explanation was offered to the judge for why the P60  for  the
    2014 tax year was not produced. Even now there is no evidence  to  show
    by way of bank statements, payslips, letter from the  employer  or  the
    2014 P60 what the sponsor's actual income was in October 2013.

 7. I am satisfied therefore that I must set  aside  the  judge's  decision
    under the Immigration Rules and remake it,  and  there  is  then  I  am
    afraid, only one possible outcome.  The appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules must be dismissed  for  failure  to  satisfy  both  the  language
    requirement and the financial requirement.

 8. The judge went on  to  look  at  the  Appellant's  circumstances  under
    Article 8 outside the Rules.  He did not refer himself to  Section  117
    of the 2002 Act although his decision post dated 28 July 2014, and  nor
    did he refer himself to the Court of Appeal decision in MM [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 985. He appears to have approached the  Article  8  proportionality
    exercise on the basis  that  the  child  must  also  be  granted  entry
    clearance for compliance with Article 8 although it is not at all clear
    why he was considering the child's circumstances in this  way.  I  note
    that the Appellant and her son have made more than one application  for
    entry clearance to allow them to settle in the UK, but  they  have  not
    yet been successful under the Immigration Rules.  If they  now  qualify
    under the Immigration Rules the answer is obvious, it is  for  a  fresh
    application to be made.

 9. It would in my judgement be entirely  inappropriate  to  approach  this
    Article 8 appeal on the basis that it was for the  Respondent  to  show
    that the sponsor could not live in Mali, although that  appears  to  be
    what the judge did. It is plain from the  papers  before  me  that  the
    sponsor was able to travel to Mali in July 2009 in safety to marry  the
    Appellant, because the marriage certificate of that date shows that  he
    was present at that ceremony.  This was not  a  proxy  marriage  as  is
    sometimes relied on before the Tribunal.  Given  the  child's  date  of
    birth over three years later it is plain that  the  sponsor  must  have
    been able to return to Mali to see and to  spend  time  with  his  wife
    subsequently, although there are no details  in  the  evidence  of  how
    frequently he has done so.  There is no possible basis  upon  which  it
    could be assumed that he cannot live with his wife and son in Mali as a
    family unit in safety. In those  circumstances  the  answer  under  the
    Article 8 proportionality  assessment  is  clear,  and  the  appeal  is
    dismissed.

Notice of decision


      The Determination did contain an error of law in the decision to allow
      the appeal under the Immigration Rules, which requires  that  decision
      to be set aside and remade. I remake that decision so  as  to  dismiss
      the appeal both under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 grounds.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
