                         (ANONIMITY ORDER IN FORCE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  I
make an order prohibiting  the  disclosure  or  publication  of  any  matter
likely to lead members of the public to identify the  Appellant.  Breach  of
this order can be punished as  a  contempt  of  court.  I  make  this  order
because the Appellant is an asylum seeker and so is entitled to privacy.

He was  given  permission  to  appeal  because,  inter  alia,  arguably  his
reasoning was not clear.

Directions were given suggesting disposal without a hearing.

In a letter dated 12 October 2020 the Respondent's  representative  accepted
that it was unclear what the judge had made of documents purporting to  come
from a court  in  Pakistan  and,  additionally,  the  Judge's  reference  at
paragraph 64 of the Decision and Reasons to "family members" in  the  UK  is
obscure. If the Judge meant the immediate family members who travelled  with
him from Pakistan it would have been better to have said so clearly.

The Respondent accepted that the adverse credibility  findings  were  unsafe
because  they  were  based,  at   least   in   part,   on   unjustified   or
unsatisfactorily explained findings.

The Respondent suggested that  the  decision  be  set  aside  and  the  case
reheard in the First-tier Tribunal.

I have read the decision and share the Respondent's concerns.

I see no need to say any more.

The First-tier Tribunal erred. I set aside its decision and  I  direct  that
the appeal be heard again in the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to extent indicated above.
