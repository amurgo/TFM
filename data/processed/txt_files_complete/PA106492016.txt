Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Seehra, Counsel, instructed by Nag Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Interpreter:  Ms Jeyaraja


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. No anonymity direction is made.

 2. The appellant, a national of Sri Lanka, travelled to the United Kingdom
    as a dependant on his wife's student visa and they entered  the  United
    Kingdom on March 3, 2011.

 3. On June 6, 2014 the appellant's wife applied to  extend  her  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 student and the  appellant  applied  to  extend  his
    leave as her dependant but their applications were refused.

 4. On April 25, 2015 the appellant's wife and the  appellant  applied  for
    leave  to  remain  on  family  and  private  life  grounds   but   both
    applications were refused. The appellant's wife appealed  her  decision
    and her appeal was due to be heard on February 24, 2016 but her  appeal
    was withdrawn on February 18, 2016 after  the  appellant  indicated  he
    intended to claim asylum.

 5. The appellant attended a screening interview on March 23, 2016 and  his
    substantive interview took place on September 15, 2016. The  respondent
    refused his application on September 21, 2016.

 6. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on October 3, 2016.  His  appeal
    came before the First-tier Tribunal  on  November  8,  2016  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on December 12, 2016 the  Tribunal  dismissed  his
    appeal. That decision was appealed and was subsequently  set  aside  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Williams on May 15, 2017  who  directed  that  the
    matter be reheard in the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. The appellant's  appeal  was  dismissed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Fox (hereinafter called "the Judge") in a decision promulgated
    on February 16, 2018.

 8. The appellant appealed this decision on March 2, 2018 arguing the Judge
    had erred by failing to consider background evidence  and  placing  too
    much weight  on  a  perceived  inconsistency  in  the  evidence.  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Finch granted permission to  appeal  on  June  28,  2018
    finding it arguable the Judge had failed to give appropriate weight  to
    all the evidence before reaching his findings in relation to the  basis
    on which the appellant feared persecution in Sri Lanka.

 9. The matter came  before  me  on  August  17,  2018  and  after  hearing
    submissions I found that whilst the findings were potentially  open  to
    be Judge they had been made independently  of  any  assessment  of  the
    documentary evidence and the Judge therefore fell into error.

10. I considered whether  to  remit  the  matter  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal but was satisfied that the error in law was due to the way the
    Judge had assessed the evidence. In other words, I was  satisfied  this
    was a not case where all the evidence needed  to  be  reheard  and  the
    appellant could, at  the  resumed  hearing,  address  any  issues  that
    concerned him by way of further written or oral evidence.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

11. At the resumed hearing Ms Seehra invited me to re-consider my  decision
    to retain the appeal and referred me to the Presidential  Guidance.  Mr
    Whitwell opposed the application pointing out that  a  decision  as  to
    venue had previously been addressed and that this was  effectively  the
    third time this case would have been heard in the First-tier  Tribunal.
    Whilst he noted that Ms Seehra  felt  a  fair  hearing  could  only  be
    achieved if the matter was  returned  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  he
    argued that as there had been  no  further  witness  statement  and  Ms
    Seehra's recent skeleton argument focused on the issue of article 8  he
    submitted that this case could be properly  dealt  with  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal especially as the error in law centred around the  failure  by
    the Judge to consider all the evidence before making findings.

12. The Presidential Guidance made it  clear  that  most  cases  should  be
    retained in the Upper Tribunal and whilst cases  involving  fresh  oral
    evidence usually would be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal  the
    Guidance made clear that this was ultimately a matter for the Tribunal.

13. Having considered the submissions  on  this  issue  I  agreed  with  Mr
    Whitwell's submission which mirrored my previous decision on August 17,
    2018 and concluded that the Upper Tribunal was best placed to deal with
    this matter.

14. The matter then proceeded with oral evidence being given  by  both  the
    appellant and his wife, Marianne Rodrigo.

15. At the conclusion of the hearing I agreed, with  the  consent  of  both
    representatives, to delay promulgation of  this  decision  pending  the
    handing down by the Supreme Court of the case KO (Nigeria) and others v
    The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53. I did so
    on the basis that this authority may affect  the  approach  I  took  to
    article 8 and in particular section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

16. Both Mr Whitwell and Ms Seehra have  provided  written  representations
    and I have recorded those in my decision and had regard to them.

17. The Tribunal has the following documents:

      a) A respondent's bundle consisting of the appellant's  screening  and
         substantive interview records, correction  letter  dated  September

    THE EVIDENCE

    The Appellant's Evidence

18. The appellant adopted his witness statement dated November 4, 2016  and
    affidavit from May 28, 2010 and gave oral evidence.

19. The appellant decided to visit the church called Our Lady of Shrine  of
    Madhu as this was a place of pilgrimage for all faiths. In order to  go
    there from where he lived (approximately 4 � hours drive from where  he
    lived in Negombo) he had to pass through the checkpoint at Chettikulam.
    The document at page 25 of the original bundle confirmed the  appellant
    and Gnanasingham Thanushan were known to each other.

20. They set off on April 30, 2010 and  were  stopped  at  the  Chettikulam
    checkpoint but allowed to pass by the army. Approximately 1-2  km  down
    the road a white van approached them  and  blocked  their  path  before
    causing the appellant and his friend to fall off the bike.

21. The men in the van verbally abused them and then three  of  the  males,
    dressed in camouflage trousers and T-shirts, alighted from the back  of
    the van. Two of the men wore army caps  and  one  wore  a  black  scarf
    across his face and they had either a long gun or a  pistol.  A  fourth
    man drove the vehicle. One of the soldiers kicked the appellant in  his
    "balls" and as he bent forward another soldier struck him with his  gun
    to his shoulder area. When the appellant tried to get  up  one  of  the
    males kicked him in his face and he fell back.

22. The male with the pistol held the gun against his friend's head. One of
    the soldiers stated that 'this was the person we wanted  "Sir"'  whilst
    pointing the pistol at  his  friend.  At  the  hearing  before  me  the
    appellant reiterated that the male called "Sir" was from  the  van  and
    not him. His friend was then taken into the van and driven away.

23. Shortly after a tractor, driven by another soldier, passed him and took
    him back to the checkpoint where he explained to the officer  what  had
    happened. He was asked if he wished to make a complaint and  he  stated
    he did not, but he was told that he should report the incident  to  the
    police.

24. The men at the checkpoint stopped a passing van and the driver took the
    appellant to the local police station where police  officers  took  his
    complaint on a small notebook.

25. From the police station other friends, from  Negombo,  took  him  to  a
    private hospital where he saw Dr Ranjan. His mother had  requested  the
    appellant's medical records, but the doctor had informed her  he  would
    not  release  them  without  positively   identifying   the   appellant
    personally. At the hearing before me he  confirmed  that  he  had  been
    unable to obtain information about his injuries from the doctor because
    the doctor had been too busy to speak to him.

26. The appellant explained that the bruises, skin damage and  knee  injury
    were caused by him falling off the bike. The injuries  he  suffered  to
    his shoulder area and groin were as a result of being assaulted. He was
    left with sore testicles, a split lip and pain to his shoulder and  the
    back of his neck as a result of being hit by the gun butt. The swelling
    caused by him falling off the  bike  lasted  4-5  days  and  the  other
    swellings lasted between 3-4 days.

27. The following day the police station called him and asked him to attend
    at Vavuniya hospital as they had located an  unidentified  body  in  an
    abandoned well. The appellant,  his  friend's  partner  and  two  other
    persons accompanied him and he identified the person as his friend.

28. His friend's body was on a trolley. His friend was wearing trousers and
    a torn T-shirt. When questioned in the First-tier Tribunal how  he  had
    been able to observe his friend's injuries  to  the  buttocks,  despite
    being covered with trousers, he replied that he meant the back  of  his
    friend's shoulders and not his backside as he had stated  at  paragraph
    13 of his witness statement. The appellant accepted that he had no  way
    of knowing whether the injury sustained by his friend was as  a  result
    of the motorcycle accident.

29. At the instigation of Rev Nethasinghe he reported his friend's death to
    the Human Rights Commission and the appellant provided a  copy  of  his
    affidavit dated May 28, 2010. The original letter acknowledging receipt
    of his complaint by the Commission has been produced. The appellant was
    unaware whether any further action had been taken on his  complaint  as
    he now resided in the United Kingdom but to the best of  his  knowledge
    no action had been taken although he had not personally chased it up.

30. When questioned why his wife had said this  incident  had  occurred  in
    either 2008 or 2009 he suggested that she must have been  confused.  He
    explained that she had never attended court prior to this case and that
    her attendance at court may have led her to becoming confused.

31. He accepted there was no evidence his friend was associated to the LTTE
    but he believed he was targeted because he was a Tamil.

32.  After  making  his  report  to  the  Commission  he  began   receiving
    threatening phone calls telling him to withdraw his  complaint  and  he
    was told that what had happened to his friend would also happen to him.
    These calls continued up until the time he left Sri Lanka on  March  3,
    2011.

33. On September 4, 2010, 6-7 people in a jeep attended at his family  home
    and threatened his family. He stated his mother was pushed and his wife
    was held by her neck and they were questioned as  to  his  whereabouts.
    The appellant stated his wife was shown a document and told  it  was  a
    warrant, but it was not handed to her. He did not report this  incident
    to the police as he feared he would become a victim like his friend.

34. The appellant confirmed that he  had  left  Sri  Lanka  through  normal
    channels and had entered the United Kingdom on March  3,  2011  as  his
    wife's dependent.

35. The appellant's mother has  never  disclosed  his  whereabouts  to  the
    authorities although the authorities had visited her home on  September
    4, 2010, January 17, 2014 and on November 21, 2015 when they questioned
    and threatened her.

36. He explained that he only became aware about  claiming  asylum  at  the
    beginning of 2016. He denied having spoken to other Sri  Lankan  asylum
    seekers about claiming asylum prior to that time.

37. At today's hearing the appellant confirmed that having arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom in 2011 his  eldest  child  had  been  attending  either
    nursery or school. He was due to start Secondary  School  in  September
    2019.

38. He confirmed that his son spoke English and if he spoke to his  son  in
    Sinhalese his son  answered  in  English.  Under  cross-examination  he
    disputed  that  his  son  spoke  Sinhalese  although  he  accepted   he
    understood the basics. He explained that neither he nor his wife  could
    speak English properly.

39. The appellant stated that his  son  had  not  spoken  to  his  paternal
    grandmother in Sri Lanka since being in the United Kingdom. He accepted
    that both he and his wife tried  to  ensure  that  he  knew  about  his
    heritage and country of origin.

    The Appellant's Wife's Evidence

40. The appellant's wife adopted her witness statement  dated  October  31,
    2016 and gave oral evidence to both the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
    Upper Tribunal.

41. In her witness statement at paragraph 5 she  stated  that  her  husband
    first had problems with the army on April 30, 2010  and  she  described
    how her husband told her that his friend had been  taken  away  by  Sri
    Lankan soldiers. During the First-tier Tribunal hearing she  could  not
    specifically recall when  the  appellant's  problems  first  began  but
    stated that his problems began in either  2008  or  2009  although  she
    stated that her memory was affected by both her mental health  and  the
    fact she had been breastfeeding. She  accepted  this  contradicted  her
    witness statement in which she stated the incident  occurred  on  April
    30, 2010.

42. Before me, she stated that the reason she had been unable to  give  the
    correct date was because she  had  been  distracted  and  uncomfortable
    giving evidence about matters she had tried to forget and she had  said
    the first thing that came into her mind.  She  accepted  there  was  no
    medical evidence supporting her claim to have any medical problems.

43. At the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  she  stated  that  the
    appellant had told her that he had suffered all his injuries  from  the
    motorcycle accident and she made no  reference  to  him  suffering  his
    injuries from a beating.

44. When describing the incident that occurred on  September  4,  2010  the
    appellant stated in her witness statement that  her  mother-in-law  had
    opened the door and when they stated they want to search the  home  she
    asked them for the warrant and  they  showed  her  a  piece  of  paper.
    Neither she nor her mother-in-law were able to read the paper  properly
    and the men told them that they would return again. She  accepted  when
    giving evidence that she had not mentioned anything about the  soldiers
    grabbing hold of her neck or assaulting her but she now  believed  that
    she may have given the  First-tier  Judge  the  wrong  answer  and  now
    supported the account provided by her husband.

45. The appellant's wife agreed, contrary to what her husband  had  stated,
    that her son kept in contact with both sets of grandparents.  He  would
    speak to her parents approximately twice a month by telephone  and  his
    paternal grandmother once a month. She maintained that he spoke to them
    in English and she translated for him.

    DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

46. A report in the Guardian dated July 28, 2018 summarised the content  of
    the UN  rapporteur.  The  Report  of  the  Special  Rapporteur  on  the
    promotion and protection of human rights  while  countering  terrorism,
    dated July 23, 2018, was based on discussions he had with the  Attorney
    general, the Chief Justice, High Court judges in Colombo,  Anuradhapura
    and  Vavuniya,  detainees  in  New  Magazine  Prison  in  Colombo   and
    Anuradhapura, lawyers and family members  of  those  detained  and  the
    Chairperson and one of the Commissioners of the National  Human  Rights
    Commission as well as representatives of civil  society.  He  concluded
    that in 2015 Sri  Lanka  appeared  to  have  turned  a  corner  with  a
    coalition government running the country. The Human Rights Council  set
    out key goals for reconciliation, transitional justice,  accountability
    and reform of the security sector but  none  of  the  measures  so  far
    adopted by the  coalition  government  were  adequate  to  ensure  real
    progress. The Prevention of Terrorism Act remained on the statute  book
    and individuals were still held in detention with the  Tamil  community
    remaining stigmatised and disenfranchised whilst  the  trust  of  other
    minority communities was being steadily eroded. He encouraged Sri Lanka
    to urgently implement previous commitments to  address  the  legacy  of
    widespread and serious human rights violations.

47. The US Country Report on Human Rights Practices the 2017 confirmed that
    the civilian authorities generally maintained control over the security
    forces although there were significant human  rights  issues  involving
    Tamils and non-denominational Christian groups. There was evidence that
    where the  police  acted  unlawfully  police  officers  were  arrested.
    Reports of torture  continued  with  there  being  evidence  of  police
    officers allegedly "roughing up" suspects to extract a confession.  The
    use of torture continued for those arrested and  detained  on  national
    security   grounds   and   the   authorities   used   the   legislation
    disproportionately against the Tamil community.

48. In the 2011 Country Information Report,  the  British  High  Commission
    advised that anyone leaving the country had to produce  their  passport
    and boarding card at the Department of Immigration and Emigration area.
    All passengers completed a departure  card  and  had  to  pass  through
    immigration control who swiped the passport against the Border  Control
    System database. The Department are notified when a  court  decides  to
    impound a suspect's passport or an arrest warrant has been issued.  The
    details of such persons would be placed on the alert or wanted list but
    there was no other mechanism to ensure that  the  Immigration  Officers
    are aware of such instances. Immigration Officers had no other power to
    prevent people  leaving  the  country  unless  the  State  Intelligence
    Service had informed them of persons suspected of terrorist activity.

49. An article dated May 2, 2010 from TamilNet confirmed that the body of a
    Tamil youth had been recovered from an abandoned  well  in  Chettikulam
    and had been identified as Gnanasingham Thanushan.

    SUBMISSIONS

50. Mr  Whitwell  adopted  the  decision  letter  and  submitted  that  the
    appellant's protection claim lacked credibility  due  to  discrepancies
    between the accounts  provided  by  the  appellant  and  his  wife.  He
    summarised these discrepancies as follows:

      a) At the first hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  his  wife  had
         stated that the event involving the "white van" occurred in  either
         2008 or 2009 whereas the appellant stated it was April 2010.

      b) The appellant's wife had failed to mention either  in  her  witness
         statement or at the  original  hearing  that  the  authorities  had
         grabbed her around her neck  in  September  2010  whereas  now  she
         supported the account that had been put forward by her husband.

      c) The appellant's wife failed to mention prior to this  hearing  that
         her husband's injuries  came  from  him  being  assaulted  and  had
         previously stated they came from the motorbike incident.

51. Today both the appellant and his wife blamed the discrepancies  on  her
    mental health condition but there was  no  medical  evidence  that  she
    suffered any difficulties giving evidence in a formal  setting  and  he
    pointed out that in her evidence to this Tribunal she stated  that  she
    said the first thing that came into her head.

52. Mr Whitwell further submitted it lacked credibility:

      a) If they had been attacked by the  army  and  his  friend  had  been
         abducted by the army that the appellant would return  to  the  army
         checkpoint and report the incident  to  the  officers  manning  the
         checkpoint and thereafter attend at the police station.

      b) The appellant would have been able to leave the country without any
         difficulties despite there being a suggestion there was  an  arrest
         warrant out for his arrest in September 2010.

53. The appellant had failed to claim asylum until 2016  despite  the  fact
    his initial leave had expired and applications to extend his stay  both
    as a Tier 4 dependent and on family and private life grounds  had  both
    been  refused  and  his  wife's  appeal  against  those  decisions  was
    withdrawn on February 18, 2016.

54. With regard to the Article 8 claim he submitted there were  credibility
    issues regarding both language  and  the  level  of  contact  that  the
    appellant's son had with his grandparents. The appellant and  his  wife
    gave inconsistent evidence about the level of contact  that  their  son
    had with his grandparents and he invited the  Tribunal  to  treat  with
    caution the account given regarding language spoken especially  as  the
    appellant and his wife both claimed their English language was  limited
    and he submitted it lacked credibility that their son  would  speak  to
    them in English when they admitted speaking to him in Sinhalese.

55. With regard to section  117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act  he  submitted  the
    appellant's son was not at a critical stage of his  education  and  had
    demonstrated that at the very least he understood Sinhalese  and  there
    was familiarity with his grandparents in Sri Lanka. The  appellant  and
    his wife both admitted that they  taught  him  about  his  origins  and
    culture and in the event the appellant and his wife had no other  basis
    to remain in this country he submitted that their  immigration  history
    was particularly poor and it would not be unreasonable to  require  the
    child to accompany his parents back to  Sri  Lanka  assuming  his  best
    interests remained with his parents.

56. He  accepted  that  when  considering  "reasonableness"  under  section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act,  or  indeed  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the
    Rules,  that  the  Appellant's  "qualifying"  child  cannot   be   held
    responsible  for  the  conduct  of  the  parents  and  so  criminality,
    overstaying or other breaches of immigration law on  the  part  of  the
    parents is not relevant to the question of whether it is reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the UK, except in so far  as  the  assessment
    must have regard to the "real world" context which  will  be  that  the
    parents are to be removed.

57. The Appellant has no right to remain in the UK, and so it is  submitted
    that his "qualifying" child will normally be  expected  to  leave  with
    him. This is a natural expectation.

58. It is further submitted that on the particular facts of this  case  and
    after taking into account factors including the absence of any  adverse
    factors in respect of the child's health, limited family ties in the UK
    and the ability to integrate into life in Sri Lanka with the assistance
    of their parents who will be returning with them, it is reasonable  for
    the qualifying child to leave the United Kingdom.

59. In KO the facts in one of the adjoined appeals of NS  is  illustrative.
    In NS the factual matrix was that one child had been in the UK for over
    ten years and neither child had experience of life outside the UK.  The
    Supreme Court upheld the decision dismissing the appeal at paragraph 52
    finding:

         "The parents' conduct was relevant in that it meant that  they  had
         to leave the country. As I have explained (para 18 above),  it  was
         in that context that  it  had  to  be  considered  whether  it  was
         reasonable  for  the  children  to  leave  with  them.  Their  best
         interests would have been for the whole family to remain here.  But
         in  a  context  where  the  parents  had  to  leave,  the   natural
         expectation would be that the children  would  go  with  them,  and
         there was nothing in the evidence reviewed by the judge to  suggest
         that that would be other than reasonable."

60. Ms Seehra adopted the content of her skeleton arguments dated  November
    8, 2016 and October 21, 2018. She submitted that the  appellant  had  a
    well-founded fear  of  persecution  from  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
    because of his  imputed  political  opinion  as  an  LTTE  member.  She
    submitted that key aspects of the appellant's claim had been  supported
    by a news article confirming  his  death,  an  article  confirming  the
    existence  of  the  Church,  the  acknowledgement   letter   from   the
    Commission, a letter from Rev Nethasingher requesting accommodation for
    the appellant and Gnanasingham Thanushan. This  letter  demonstrated  a
    connection between the appellant and Gnanasingham Thanushan.

61. She submitted that the appellant had provided a consistent account  and
    that any inconsistencies between his and his wife's evidence should  be
    treated  as  confusion  on  her  behalf  due  to  the  fact   she   was
    breastfeeding at the time of the alleged incident  and  suffering  from
    mental health issues.

62. There was background evidence confirming  the  ongoing  persecution  of
    Tamils and  previous  incidents  involving  white  vans  supported  the
    appellant's claim that he had been confronted by males in a  white  van
    who were from the army. The incident had been reported to the police at
    the suggestion of the authorities at the checkpoint.

63. The background evidence also confirmed that when the appellant and  his
    family left the country there was few procedures in  place  to  prevent
    them leaving and she submitted that he would not have been  flagged  up
    on any database.

64. Ms Seehra referred to the current objective  evidence  which  suggested
    that disappearances continued.

65. Applying the Country Guidance in GJ and Others [2013]  UKUT  00319  and
    the Court of Appeal decision of MP and Others [2014] EWCA Civ  829  she
    submitted that the appellant would be at risk not only because of  what
    had happened to him  but  because  he  had  provided  evidence  to  the
    Commission which  potentially  implicated  the  army  in  his  friend's
    murder. The latest background evidence suggested that the situation had
    deteriorated since GJ and that even those viewed  as  supervisors  were
    subject to harassment.

66. She submitted that no adverse finding should be made under section 8 of
    the 2004 Act through the appellant's  failure  to  claim  asylum  until
    2016, despite arriving in  this  country  in  2011,  because  they  had
    entered with leave and had no reason to seek asylum.

67. Alternatively, she submitted that the appellant and his  family  should
    be granted discretionary leave to remain  under  article  8  ECHR.  She
    referred to the fact that the appellant's son had lived in this country
    for over seven years and whilst he may not have met the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules at the date of application  nevertheless  section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act applied and she submitted that it would not  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.

68. Bearing in mind the length of time the child had been in  this  country
    she submitted there had to be powerful reasons, as identified in MT and
    ET (child's best interests; ex tempore  pilot)  Nigeria  [2018]  UKUT88
    and MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 as well as the  respondent's  own
    policy (Family Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b), to find  it  would
    be reasonable to require the child to leave the United Kingdom  as  the
    child should not be blamed for his parents failings.

69. The narrow issue in KO (as far as it is relevant to the instant appeal)
    was whether when determining if it was "reasonable to expect"  a  child
    to leave the UK (section 117B(6)) the Tribunal was concerned only  with
    the position of the child, and not with  the  immigration  history  and
    conduct of the parents, or  any  wider  public  factors  in  favour  of
    removal.

70. In deciding that issue the Court  essentially  ruled  that  in  a  non-
    deportation  appeal  the  parents'  conduct  was  irrelevant   to   the
    assessment of reasonableness under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv)  or  section
    117B(6), considering inter alia:

      a) Zoumbas [2013] 1 WLR 3690 and the principle that "a child must  not
         be blamed for matters for which he or she is not responsible,  such
         as the conduct of the parent".

      b) There was no requirement to consider criminality or  misconduct  of
         the  parent  in  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv),  and   section   117B(6)
         incorporated the substance of the rule in the context of the  right
         of the parent to remain.

      c) Section 117B(6) was a freestanding provision.

      d) It was relevant to consider where the parents were expected  to  be
         since it would normally be reasonable for  the  child  to  be  with
         them.  If the parents cease to have a right to remain, and it would
         not be reasonable for the child to leave, then section 117B(6)  may
         give parents a right to remain.

      e) It was right that  the  issue  of  "reasonableness"  under  section
         117B(6) was focused on the position of the child.

71. She submitted that KO did not overrule MA Pakistan [2016] EWCA Civ  705
    (save for limited disagreement at  paragraph  19  of  KO  referring  to
    paragraph 40 of MA Pakistan).  The appeal of NS in  KO  was  considered
    and dismissed on its own facts.




    FINDINGS

    ASSESSMENT OF PROTECTION CLAIM

72. The appellant brought an asylum claim based on  an  incident  which  is
    said to have occurred on April 30, 2010. Following that  incident,  the
    appellant claims he received threatening calls and visits to the family
    home including two visits which took place after the appellant and  his
    family had left Sri Lanka and come to the United Kingdom.

73. In considering the appellant's claim about what happened in Sri Lanka I
    have taken into account not only the written and oral evidence provided
    by the appellant and his wife  before  the  Upper  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal but I have also taken into account the documents  and  country
    evidence that have been submitted by the appellant's representatives in
    this appeal.

74. In support of his claim that something happened  he  has  produced  the
    following evidence:

      a) An article from TamilNet dated May 2, 2010 which  referred  to  the
         body of a victim identified as Gnanasingham Thanushan  being  found
         from an abandoned well in Chettikulam.

      b) An affidavit submitted by the appellant which is a  document  which
         the appellant signed on May 28, 2010 in which he described what had
         happened.

      c) A letter dated June 15, 2010 from  the  Commission  of  Enquiry  on
         Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation. This letter refers to  receiving
         a complaint from the appellant and advised that they were currently
         investigating the circumstances and informed him he would hear back
         from them further.

75. The appellant claimed three men, wearing camouflage trousers  and  army
    caps, alighted from the vehicle  and  attacked  him  and  abducted  his
    friend. The appellant  claimed  that  the  van  was  a  white  van  and
    historically "white vans" have been linked to abductions by the army in
    Sri Lanka.

76. The appellant  and  his  wife  blame  her  medical  condition  for  the
    inconsistencies in the wife's evidence  and  she  even  stated  in  her
    evidence to me that she often said the first thing that came  into  her
    head. This would have been  a  traumatic  incident  and  the  fact  the
    appellant's wife gave contradictory  evidence  to  that  given  by  her
    husband, in relation to the date and  how  he  received  his  injuries,
    undermined the weight that I could attach to those pieces of evidence.

77. The appellant's wife demonstrated a willingness to alter  her  evidence
    to match that of her husband in relation to the  date  of  the  alleged
    assault, how her husband received his injuries and how she was attacked
    in her home by the authorities. They both blamed those  inconsistencies
    on the fact the wife was breastfeeding  at  the  time  of  the  alleged
    incident and was suffering from mental health problems.  There  was  no
    medical  evidence  to  support  any  medical  condition   or   learning
    difficulty.

78. I also do not find it credible that having been attacked  by  the  army
    the appellant would then return to  the  army  checkpoint  and  make  a
    complaint to army officers. It lacked credibility that  he  would  have
    done this especially having claimed to have been assaulted.

79. I find the inconsistencies in the evidence on  these  important  issues
    undermines the reliability  of  their  evidence  and  when  considering
    whether the incident  at  the  roadside  occurred  I  must  take  these
    inconsistences into account.

80. The appellant argued that there is further evidence that  supports  his
    claim in the form of:

      a) Letter from the Reverend which demonstrated there as  a  connection
         between the appellant and Gnanasingham Thanushan.

      b) The letter from the Commission and the affidavit  provided  by  the
         appellant in support of that complaint.

81. Mr Whitwell argued  that  little  weight  should  be  attached  to  the
    affidavit or the letter  from  the  Commission  because  the  appellant
    failed to produce (a) details of the actual complaint and (b)  evidence
    of what happened to his complaint.

82. In considering  the  letter  from  the  Commission  and  the  affidavit
    provided by the appellant in support of that complaint  I  accept  that
    both  Mr  Whitwell's  submission  has  some  merit.  Neither  of  these
    documents are recent documents but go back to 2010  but  the  appellant
    has been unable to adduce any other evidence about the complaint.

83. Corroboration is not required in protection  claims  but  Lord  Justice
    Thomas in TK (Burundi) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2009] EWCA Civ 40 stated," Where evidence to support an account  given
    by a party is or should readily be available, a Judge is, in  my  view,
    plainly entitled to take into  account  the  failure  to  provide  that
    evidence and any explanations for that failure. "

84. This Tribunal does not have the actual complaint and the mere fact  the
    appellant signed an affidavit does not mean that the  content  of  this
    affidavit is what was presented to the Commission.

85. I am satisfied that it was reasonable for the appellant  to  have  made
    further enquiries about his complaint and adduce evidence of  what  his
    complaint had been. This is not the first Tribunal to hear  his  appeal
    and knowing the issues that had been raised it had  been  open  to  the
    appellant,  who  has  been   legally   represented   throughout   these
    proceedings, to have made further enquiries and  attempted  to  address
    those issues. His evidence to me was that he had not  followed  up  the
    complaint at all. These matters undermine the credibility of the claim.



86. Ms Seehra  invited  me  to  find  a  link  between  the  appellant  and
    Gnanasingham Thanushan based on the letter from the  Minister  and  the
    report on TamilNet.

87. I  accept  that  letter  names  both  the  appellant  and  Gnanasingham
    Thanushan and the TamilNet article refers to a body being found  in  an
    abandoned well as being that of Gnanasingham Thanushan.

88. When considering the appellant' claim I have to balance these pieces of
    evidence against any inconsistencies that arose from the evidence given
    by the appellant and his wife and have regard to the  letter  from  the
    Commission and the affidavit submitted by the appellant.

89. I have already mentioned the events at the family home on September  4,
    2010 and the evidence put forward was  that  the  authorities  attended
    intending to arrest him and they had a warrant. There was a discrepancy
    in the wife's evidence about what happened because she now  adopts  the
    account put forward by her husband that she had been grabbed around the
    neck even though he was not present whereas she had previously made  no
    claim of being assaulted. This undermines their account  of  events  on
    that day and also brings into question whether there  was  actually  an
    arrest warrant in place.

90. Having assessed all the evidence, I do not  accept  the  appellant  was
    attacked as claimed. No medical evidence has been adduced  despite  his
    claim that he was seen by Dr Ranjan. The appellant's  mother  continues
    to live in  Sri  Lanka  and  despite  the  appellant's  claim  that  he
    contacted the doctor no medical evidence has been  produced.  Whilst  I
    accept a doctor would not release medical evidence without a  patient's
    authority I am satisfied that it was open to the  appellant  to  obtain
    such information. He instructed solicitors throughout this  matter  and
    it is not unusual for medical evidence to be sent to solicitors and  it
    is not unusual for medical evidence to be obtained after  a  letter  of
    authority has been  adduced.  The  absence  of  this  medical  evidence
    undermines the credibility of what happened. I note  that  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal was adjourned for medical evidence to be
    obtained. None was adduced before the First-tier Tribunal and no  steps
    have been taken to obtain such evidence to present to this Tribunal.

91. Despite providing a number of documents about what he claimed  happened
    the appellant did not provide  any  evidence  about  his  own  hospital
    treatment or even evidence of his friend's death certificate.

92. Even if I accept his friend was found in an abandoned  well  I  am  not
    satisfied the appellant was present when his friend was "abducted".

93. The appellant's claim about being  attacked  by  the  army  also  lacks
    credibility although I accept there is evidence that such attacks  have
    taken place. The appellant stated he went through  an  army  checkpoint
    and he claimed that after the alleged  incident  he  returned  to  this
    checkpoint and the army tried to assist him. It lacks credibility  that
    the army would allow him to pass without incident  but  then  intercept
    him shortly afterwards.

94. The appellant claimed that the authorities came looking for him with an
    arrest warrant on September 4, 2010 but there were no further visits to
    his family home until after he had left the country. If the authorities
    had an interest in him to the extent that an arrest  warrant  had  been
    issued it lacks credibility no further visits would have been made.

95. The 2011 report suggests the Department of Immigration  and  Emigration
    are informed when  an  arrest  warrant  is  issued  and  the  fact  the
    appellant was able to leave without any difficulties suggests  that  no
    warrant was issued albeit I note there was no other mechanism to ensure
    that the Immigration Officers were aware of such instances so I do  not
    attach weight to the fact he was able to leave without being stopped.

96. For the reasons given above I reject his claim that he was attacked  as
    claimed or that his family have been harassed since that date.

97. Ms Seehra argued that I should depart from  the  country  guidance  and
    relied on the new material adduced. I am not persuaded  that  returning
    as a failed Tamil asylum seeker would place this appellant at  risk  in
    light of my other findings.

    ASSESSMENT OF PRIVATE/FAMILY LIFE CLAIM

98. The appellant seeks to remain in this country primarily on the back  of
    his child's article 8 claim.

99. Both the appellant and his wife have been here with  limited  leave  to
    remain at all  times.  They  came  here  as  a  student  and  dependant
    respectively and their immigration status  never  changed  until  their
    applications were refused.

100. I accept that as their eldest child has  been  here  over  seven  years
    that this case merits consideration under article 8.

101. Section 117B of the 2002 Act sets out statutory factors which  must  be
    taken into account when considering any private or family  life  claim.
    Adverse factors in this appeal include:

      a)  Inability  to  speak  English  (both  gave  evidence  through   an
         interpreter  and  admitted  to  having  limited  English   language
         skills).

      b) They are not financially independent and there was no  evidence  of
         any credible or reliable third party support.

      c) Little weight should be given to a private life  established  by  a
         person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration   status   is
         precarious. The Supreme Court in Rhuppiah (Appellant)  v  Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 58 made  clear,  "....
         everyone who, not being a UK citizen, is present in the UK and  who
         has leave to reside here other than to do  so  indefinitely  has  a
         precarious immigration status for the purposes of section 117B(5)."

102. Both the appellant and his wife have family in  Sri  Lanka  and  whilst
    the appellant played down the level of contact, in  particular  between
    his eldest child and his mother, I am satisfied that there  is  regular
    contact as evidenced by the appellant's wife's own evidence.

103. The appellant and his wife came to  this  country  to  study  and  that
    leave has ended. They clearly had both a family and private life in Sri
    Lanka-a country where they have lived the majority of  their  lives.  I
    therefore find that if this private or family life  appeal  was  to  be
    decided only having regard to the appellant and his wife then it  would
    be proportionate to remove them.

104. However, as there are two children of the family I must have regard  to
    Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009.  The
    eldest was born in Sri Lanka on July 31, 2008  and  has  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom since January 27, 2011. There is a younger child who was
    born in this country on January 17, 2014.

105. The eldest child lived in Sri  Lanka  for  2  �  years  before  he  was
    brought here and has spent 7 � years living in  this  country.  Section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act must therefore be considered in this appeal and
    both parties have addressed this section in written submissions. It has
    already been conceded that at the date  of  application  the  appellant
    could not satisfy either  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  or
    paragraph 276ADE HC 395.

106. In written submissions, both representatives appear  to  agree  on  the
    correct approach to take when assessing "reasonableness". The  Tribunal
    is concerned only with the position of the  child,  and  not  with  the
    immigration history and conduct of the parents,  or  any  wider  public
    factors in favour of removal and the child cannot be  held  responsible
    for the conduct of the parents  and  any  criminality,  overstaying  or
    other breaches of immigration law on the part of his parents except  in
    so far as the assessment must have regard to the "real  world"  context
    which will be that the parents are to be removed.

107. The evidence before me is that the eldest  child  speaks  English  well
    and is doing well at school. I do not accept the parent's evidence that
    their child's Sinhalese is limited because not only did he live for 2 �
    years in Sri Lanka, when the only language he  would  have  spoken  was
    Sinhalese,  but  he  also  has  regular  contact  with  both  sets   of
    grandparents who I am satisfied do not speak English. I do  not  accept
    the appellant's claim that he and his wife  acted  as  interpreter  for
    their child because they both admitted their English was limited.

108. The Supreme Court made clear that the appellant's  immigration  history
    was a factor to take into account when having regard to the "real world
    context". Neither parent had  any  entitlement  or  expectation  to  be
    allowed to remain in their own right. When they came to this country in
    2011 they had no expectation of being allowed to  remain  because  they
    came here on a student visa. They have attempted to delay their removal
    by submitting a number of  applications  and  those  applications  have
    either been refused or withdrawn. In the "real  world"  they  would  be
    removed.

109. There are not health issues  affecting  either  child.  The  children's
    best interests are to remain with their parents.

110. I am satisfied, on the facts  of  this  case,  that  removal  would  be
    proportionate and in particular, it would be reasonable to require  the
    appellant's eldest child to accompany his parents and sibling  back  to
    Sri Lanka where they have their whole family.

    DECISION

111. I dismiss the protection claim.

112. I dismiss the claim on ECHR grounds.
