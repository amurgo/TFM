                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    the First-tier  Tribunal  (FTTJ  Malone)  allowing  an  appeal  by  the
    applicant against the decision made on 13 November 2013 to  refuse  her
    further  leave  to  remain  and  remove  her  to  Nigeria.    In   this
    determination I will refer to the parties as they were before the First-
    tier Tribunal, the  Secretary  of  State  as  the  respondent  and  the
    applicant as the appellant.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 14  July  1992.   On  20
    August 2008 she was granted leave  to  enter  as  a  student  until  30
    September 2010.  Subsequently, she was granted further leave to  remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student until 30 September 2013.   On  26  August
    2013 she applied for further leave to remain in the same capacity.

3.   However, her application  was  refused.   Whilst  she  was  awarded  30
    points under Appendix A (Attributes) in the light of  the  confirmation
    of  acceptance  for  studies  submitted,  she  failed   to   meet   the
    requirements of Appendix C (Maintenance/Funds).  She  was  required  to
    show that she would have the necessary funds  to  cover  fees  for  the
    first academic year of her course and funds of �800 per month  for  two
    months.  She had to show that she was in possession of  �15,100  for  a
    consecutive 28 day period no earlier than 31 days before  the  date  of
    application.  The statements she  submitted  were  more  than  31  days
    before the date of application.  She had also relied on funds from  her
    parents' bank account but had not provided a  consent  letter  for  the
    funds to be used in support of the application.  For these reasons  her
    application was refused.

4.   She appealed against this decision and her  appeal  was  heard  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 13 March 2014.  The judge  heard  evidence  from
    the appellant and from her cousin, David  Otohwo,  a  British  citizen.
    The judge accepted that the appellant had  first  come  to  the  UK  in
    August 2008 to study.  She had obtained her A levels and then  went  on
    to graduate from the University  of  Bradford  as  a  BSc  in  Business
    Economics achieving a 2:1 degree.  She graduated  in  July  2013.   She
    went on to read for an MSc in International Management at  Loughborough
    University and it was to enable her to follow this course that she made
    her Tier 4 application on 26 August 2013.  It  was  accepted  that  the
    appellant failed to provide the necessary bank statements covering  the
    period specified by the Rules  and  the  judge  rightly  held  that  it
    followed that she could not satisfy paragraph 245ZX and that her appeal
    under the Immigration Rules had to be dismissed [19].

5.   The judge went on to consider Article 8.  He recorded at [22]  that  at
    the hearing he was provided with bank statements that showed that as at
    the date of application  the  appellant  had  had  the  required  funds
    available to her for the requisite period in the accounts of her mother
    and Mr Otohwo.  He heard evidence about how her  studies  were  funded.
    Mr Otohwo would provide the funds out of his own money and then reclaim
    it from the appellant's mother.  He was having a holiday home built  in
    Nigeria for which the appellant's mother was  paying  and  they  ran  a
    contra account.  Her mother works out how much  she  has  paid  for  Mr
    Otohwo's house while he works out how much the appellant's funding  has
    cost and a balancing payment is made.  Having considered  the  evidence
    before him the judge  accepted  that  the  required  funding  had  been
    available when the application was made.


6.   He accepted that the appellant was a genuine and  hard-working  student
    and that she was working hard for her finals.  He said that for her  to
    return  to  Nigeria  without  her  post-graduate  qualification  having
    already spent such a  sizeable  sum  on  her  second  degree  would  be
    disastrous [35].

7.   The judge went on to consider Article  8  finding  that  the  appellant
    enjoyed private life in the UK and that  her  removal  would  interfere
    with that private life.  It would be in accordance with the law and  in
    pursuance of a legitimate aim.  He went on to address the  question  of
    proportionality and found that removal would be  disproportionate.   He
    said that the disruption to the appellant's studies would be  about  as
    severe  as  it  could  be  and  would  serve  no  useful  purpose.   He
    acknowledged that it was unfortunate that  she  had  not  provided  the
    respondent with the detailed financial information he  had  seen  which
    showed that  she  satisfied  those  requirements.   He  summarised  his
    findings as follows:

        "41. I answer the question Lord Bingham posed in  paragraph  20  of
             his opinion in Huang, suitably adapted to address private life,
             in the affirmative.  The Appellant's removal would therefore be
             unlawful.


        42.   I  found  the  Appellant  and  Mr.  Otohwo  to  be   engaging
             individuals.  I recommend that the Appellant be given leave  to
             remain until, say, February 2015 which would enable her to stay
             here for her graduation, the date of  which  is  uncertain  but
             should have taken place by then.  As I say, the Appellant  told
             me that, on graduation, she will return to Nigeria  and  resume
             life there.


        43.  I find that the Respondent's decision  is  not  in  accordance
             with the law and  the  Immigration  Rules.   This  appeal  must
             therefore be allowed."

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

8.   In the respondent's grounds it is argued that the judge  erred  in  law
    in that  having  concluded  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    financial requirements of the Rules for Tier 4 Migrants or the  private
    life requirements set out at para 276ADE he should not have simply gone
    on to consider Article 8 with regard EB (Kosovo)  [2008]  UKHL  41  and
    Huang [2007] UKHL 11.  He should have  considered  whether  there  were
    compelling circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the  new
    Rules to require the grant of such leave: Nagre v  Secretary  of  State
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).  Further, in finding  that  removal  would  be
    disproportionate on the basis that it would  cause  disruption  to  the
    appellant's continuing education in the UK, the  judge  had  failed  to
    take account of the guidance given in Patel and Others v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72 and in particular [57].


9.   Mr Nath adopted these grounds  in  his  submissions  arguing  that  the
    judge had erred in law by failing to consider the  public  interest  in
    maintaining immigration  control  particularly  in  the  light  of  the
    judgment in Nagre and the determination in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640.  He
    had further erred in his approach to education  failing  to  take  into
    account the comments of the Supreme Court in Patel.

10.  Mr Kpogho submitted that the appellant had more than  private  life  in
    the UK.  She had been staying for a number of years with her  relatives
    and this added a significant element to her private life.  Her position
    could be distinguished from Patel.  The appellant was in the middle  of
    her exams.  Her course would be completed in September  and  she  would
    graduate in February 2015.  He submitted that the judge had  reached  a
    decision properly open to him.

11.  In reply Mr  Nath  emphasised  that  the  appellant  had  not  met  the
    requirements of the Rules and the judge had  not  followed  the  proper
    approach when assessing Article 8.  He had not been entitled  to  treat
    Article 8 as a power to dispense with the Rules.

The Error of Law

12.  The issue for me at this stage of  the  appeal  is  whether  the  judge
    erred in law such  that  the  decision  should  be  set  aside.   I  am
    satisfied that he did for the following reasons.  The  changes  to  the
    Immigration Rules in July 2012 were intended to set out how the balance
    under Article 8 should be struck  between  the  right  to  respect  for
    private and family life and the legitimate aims set out  under  Article
    8(2).  This general  purpose  is  set  out  in  GEN1.1.   Further,  the
    requirements for obtaining leave as a student are set out  as  part  of
    the points-based scheme with  a  requirement  that  specified  evidence
    should be provided with the application as  identified  in  the  Rules.
    The provisions of s.85A of the 2002 Act were enacted to make  it  clear
    that at the hearing of an appeal against an adverse  decision  reliance
    could  only  be  placed  on  evidence  not  produced  at  the  date  of
    application save in a number of identified circumstances, none of which
    apply in the present case.

13.  The appellant sought to rely on private life within Article 8  but  she
    could not meet the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE.   In  assessing
    whether the refusal of further leave  was  disproportionate  the  judge
    should have followed the guidance in MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of  State
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, Nagre  and  Gulshan  and  in  a  case  where  the
    requirements of the Rules could not be  met  considered  whether  there
    were  exceptional  or   compelling   circumstances   not   sufficiently
    recognised under the Rules so justifying  further  consideration  under
    Article 8.  The judge clearly attached considerable weight to the  fact
    that the applicant could have met the requirements of the  points-based
    scheme had the evidence been available  at  the  date  of  application.
    However, that overlooks the purpose of s.85A which prevent the  further
    evidence considered by the judge being admitted in an appeal under  the
    Rules.


14.  The judge said in [20] that he attached significant weight to the  fact
    that the appellant could not meet the requirements of paragraph  276ADE
    but he failed to give any weight to the  purpose  of  the  points-based
    scheme requiring all evidence to  be  produced  with  the  application.
    Further, in Patel the Supreme Court held that the  right  to  education
    was not in itself a right falling within Article 8 and that  Article  8
    must not be used as a dispensing power.

15.  I am therefore satisfied that the judge failed to  approach  Article  8
    in accordance with the approach set out in the authorities to  which  I
    have already referred and failed to give proper weight  to  the  public
    interest set out in the Immigration  Rules  both  in  relation  to  the
    points-based scheme and the need to maintain immigration  control.   He
    also failed to consider what the Supreme  Court  have  said  about  the
    right to education not being in itself a right within Article 8.  These
    errors had a material bearing on the judge's findings  and  conclusions
    and for this reason the decision should be set aside.

Re-making the Decision

16.  Mr Nath submitted  that  the  appellant  only  had  a  very  restricted
    private life and that the failure to meet the requirements of the Rules
    meant that the public interest outweighed  any  interference  with  her
    private life.  The appeal,  he  submitted,  should  be  dismissed.   Mr
    Kpogho submitted that in fact the applicant had a very  strong  private
    life and in the light of the history of her studies in this country, it
    would be disproportionate for the appeal to be dismissed under  Article
    8 not least as all her fees had been fully paid.   I  also  heard  from
    both the appellant and Mr Otohwo who confirmed her circumstances.   The
    appellant said that after  she  completed  her  studies  she  would  be
    returning to Nigeria.  She was just coming up to exams.  There was  one
    further piece of coursework  and  her  course  would  be  completed  in
    September.

17.   This  is  a  case  where  the  appellant  is  not  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules for further leave to remain as a  student  or
    on private life grounds.  She failed to produce the evidence  specified
    in the Rules when she applied for an extension of her stay to  complete
    her course.  The fact that she was later able to show  that  she  could
    meet those requirements would not help her so far  as  the  immigration
    appeal  was  concerned  as  that  evidence  would  be  excluded   under
    s.85A(3)(b).  I would accept that  it  is  admissible  in  relation  to
    Article 8 but in  the  light  of  the  purpose  of  the  Rules  and  in
    particular  the  way  the  points-based  system   is   structured   and
    administered, it must be a matter of relatively little weight.  Article
    8 cannot be used as a way of dispensing with the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

18.  Having considered  the  Rules,  the  proper  approach  is  to  consider
    whether there are exceptional or compelling circumstances which justify
    further consideration under Article 8.  I am not satisfied  that  there
    are.  There is no reason to doubt that the appellant is, as  the  judge
    found, a hard-working and genuine student and the interference with her
    studies is without doubt unfortunate.  However, the primary reason  for
    that arises from the failure to produce the evidence required when  her
    application for an extension was made.  I am not satisfied  that  there
    are any circumstances which can properly be described as exceptional or
    compelling particularly in the light of  what  Lord  Carnwath  said  in
    Patel at [57] that the right to an education is not in itself  a  right
    protected under Article 8.  I also take  into  account  the  cautionary
    note he struck by commenting that Article 8 was not to  be  used  as  a
    general dispensing power.

19.  In these circumstances I am not satisfied that  the  interference  with
    the appellant's right to respect for her private life is such that  the
    refusal for further leave to remain and the  requirement  to  leave  is
    disproportionate to a legitimate aim.  It is correct that the appellant
    is now very near the completion of her course.  However, it must  be  a
    matter for the  respondent  to  consider  whether  as  an  exercise  of
    discretion outside the Rules the appellant is permitted  to  remain  to
    complete her course.

Decision

20.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and the decision is set aside.   I
    re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal on both  immigration  and
    human rights grounds.
