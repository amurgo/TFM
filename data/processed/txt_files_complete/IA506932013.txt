Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Garrod, Counsel, instructed by Justice Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Ghana who applied for a  residence  card
    as confirmation of a right to reside here in respect of his marriage to
    his partner Agatha Wippich who is a German citizen.

 2. This appeal  has  a  long   history  and  I  shall  summarise  it.  His
    application was refused in a decision  dated  27th  November  2013.   A
    subsequent appeal was dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Boyd.
    Grounds of application were lodged to that decision and  permission  to
    appeal was granted.  I heard the appeal at Field House on 22nd  October
    2014 and on 19th November 2014 found errors in law  sufficient  to  set
    aside the decision of Judge Boyd in its entirety.  Thus the matter came
    back before me on the above date.

Preliminary Matters

 3. Mr Garrod indicated that the issue before the Tribunal was  whether  or
    not the parties were in  a  durable  relationship.   It  had  not  been
    possible in the time available to secure evidence that the marriage was
    recognised in Germany.

 4. It is helpful to set out the witness statements of  the  Appellant  and
    his partner.

Witness Statement of the Appellant

 5. He is a Ghanaian national who came here  on  26th  January  2004  on  a
    visitor visa  and  overstayed.  He  subsequently  met  his  partner  in
    February 2012 and they agreed to get married on  1st  July  2012.  They
    made arrangements for the ceremony to be performed in the  presence  of
    elders of both families and their marriage took place by proxy on  25th
    August 2012 in Accra, Ghana.   They could not personally  attend  their
    ceremony due to their  financial  circumstances.   They  married  under
    Ghanaian customary law.  The marriage is genuine.

 6. He loves his wife and they intend to live in the UK as husband and wife
    as they are in a durable and subsisting relationship.

Witness Statement of Agatha Wippich

 7. She is Ghanaian by birth and a German by naturalisation.  She came here
    on 15th September 2007 to join her  daughter  who  is  German  and  was
    attending school.  She has  continued  to  reside  here.  She  met  the
    Appellant in February 2012 and they agreed to marry in July  2012.  The
    necessary arrangements were  made  for  the  marriage  ceremony  to  be
    performed in the presence of elders of both families.  They  could  not
    personally attend  their  marriage  ceremony  due  to  their  financial
    circumstances as she was the only breadwinner in the family.

 8. They married under Ghanaian  customary law.

 9. His statement mirrors that of the Appellant.

10. She loves her husband and they intend to live in the UK as husband  and
    wife and they are in a durable and subsisting relationship.





The Oral Evidence

11. The Appellant's evidence is as noted in my Record of Proceedings and he
    adopted his statement as true.  He was in a lasting  relationship  with
    his wife.

12. In cross-examination he said he did not look into  the  possibility  of
    getting married in the United Kingdom.  He attended the Immaculate  and
    St Thomas Church (Cathedral) in Northampton.  He  was  a  Catholic  and
    went every week with his wife. His wife had one child who  he  had  not
    met and who was not on good terms with her  mother.   It  is  a  family
    problem.  The daughter was  married.   He  did  not  know  if  she  had
    children.  He was not working.  She was and sometimes  gave  him  money
    namely �20 - �50.  It was not a fixed sum.  When asked as to whether he
    gave her a Christmas present he said that they went out for  dinner  on
    Christmas Sunday.  It was  a Mandarin buffet.  He  had  paid.   He  had
    saved money for it.  She worked from 10 a.m to 7 p.m. Monday to  Friday
    and left the house at about 9 a.m. getting a bus  to  work.   Sometimes
    they would eat together in the evening.  Last night they  had  yam  and
    stew.  There was no re-examination of the witness.

13. Agatha Wippich gave evidence as noted in my Record of  Proceedings  and
    adopted her statement as true. She intended to live  with  her  husband
    for ever.

14. In cross-examination she said that they did not get married in  the  UK
    because she was the only person working and they could not afford to do
    that.  They might have a church wedding but it  was  not  yet  planned.
    She went to church with her  husband,  namely  the  Immaculate  and  St
    Thomas Cathedral.  She had a daughter but there was a  problem  and  it
    was a long story. The daughter did not love her. She worked 30 hours  a
    week, namely 10 to 2 on a Monday and 10 to 7 on Tuesday, Wednesday  and
    Thursday. She was off on a Friday. She left the house at 9 o'clock  and
    took a bus to work. She gave her husband money.  For example she  would
    sometimes give him cash if he was going for a  haircut.   Sometimes  he
    would ask her for money.  She  could  not  give  him  much.   Asked  at
    Christmas whether she gave him a present she said that she gave  him  a
    card.  He gave her a card.  As for dinner, they went out with  friends.
    It was a Chinese buffet. He contributed to the cost  -  she  had  paid.
    They normally did the cooking together. Last night they  had  rice  and
    stew.  Her husband had a son whom she had not met.  There  was  no  re-
    examination of the witness.

Submissions for the Home Office

15. Reliance was placed on the reasons for refusal letter.

16. The question was whether  the  relationship  was  durable.  There  were
    discrepancies in  the  accounts.   There  was  a  difference  over  the
    financial arrangements in that he said the amount was not fixed.

17. There was a material difference in the evidence in the meal  that  they
    had enjoyed - he said that it was a Christmas gift for her which he had
    saved money and for which he paid. She said that  they  were  out  with
    friends and that she had paid. There was  a  difference  about  whether
    they hoped  to  have  a  church  wedding  in  Ghana.   There  was  some
    difference in the terms of her working hours.

18. There was no expert evidence that the marriage was  accepted  as  valid
    according to the laws of Germany and accordingly the appeal  could  not
    succeed on that basis.

19. If I considered if there was a durable  relationship  then  the  matter
    should be remitted to the Secretary of State for the  exercise  of  her
    discretion under paragraph 17(4) of the 2006 EEA Regulations.

Submissions for the Appellant

20. The issue was one of fact. There was considerable corroborative written
    evidence from the Appellant  and  Sponsor.  The  application  had  been
    ongoing for about two years.   They  had  a  joint  household  contents
    policy - see page 142 of the Appellant's bundle.

21. While not all of their oral evidence was entirely consistent,  most  of
    it was and any differences were probably down to  their  perception  of
    events  rather than as a matter of memory.

22. I was asked to allow the appeal and remit the matter to  the  Secretary
    of State.

Conclusions

23. Ultimately the only issue which I have been asked to decide is  whether
    or not the parties are in a durable relationship.  If they are not then
    the appeal must fail and if they are then I understood the  parties  to
    be in agreement that the matter should be remitted to the Secretary  of
    State to consider whether to grant a  residence  card.  The  burden  of
    proof  is  on  the  Appellant  and  the  standard  is  the  balance  of
    probabilities.

24. I am firmly of the view that the parties are in a durable relationship.
    Their written statements are corroborative of each other's account  and
    it is some two and a  half  years  since  they  agreed  to  marry.  The
    documentary evidence at page 142 being a  letter  from  Barclays  dated
    11th January 2013 indicates that  they  have  a  home  contents  policy
    together at the address at 118 Elliston Gardens, Northampton.

25. In their oral evidence they were thoroughly tested in cross-examination
    and most of the answers  given  supported  the  other's  account.   For
    example, they gave identical evidence on which church they attended and
    whether they went together. The evidence about  the  contact  with  the
    Sponsor's daughter was the same. The hours of work of the Sponsor  were
    slightly different although reasonably similar and they agreed that she
    left for work at 9 a.m. and took the bus. They were  agreed  that  they
    did not give each other a Christmas present.   They  agreed  that  they
    went out to a Chinese buffet although the evidence was different as  to
    who paid for that. They agreed that last night  they  had  had  "stew".
    Furthermore, I thought their evidence had the ring of truth about it.

26. It is not disputed that Agatha Wippich is a German national  exercising
    treaty rights here and that the Appellant is entitled to  apply  for  a
    residence card if he is in a durable relationship with her.

27. I deal with matters as they stand at the date of the  hearing  and,  as
    stated, I am holding that the parties are  in  a  durable  relationship
    because I believe the evidence they have given to that effect.

28. This does not, in itself, indicate that the Appellant is entitled to  a
    residence card as in terms of Section 17(4) of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 the Secretary of State "may issue  a  residence  card"
    once she has  conducted  "an  extensive  examination  of  the  personal
    circumstances of the applicant" - see Regulation 17(5).

29. It follows that to that limited extent this appeal must be allowed.  No
    doubt the Secretary of State will consider  the  circumstances  of  the
    Appellant given that  he  has  now  been  found  to  be  in  a  durable
    relationship.

30. There is no need for anonymity order and I am not making a fee order as
    I was not asked to do so and much of  the  evidence  resulting  in  the
    finding that the parties were in a durable relationship only came after
    the application was refused.

Decision

31. The appeal is allowed to the limited extent that the Secretary of State
    exercises  her  discretion  under  Section  17(4)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.
