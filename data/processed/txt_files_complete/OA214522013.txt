Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms E Savage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms J Kyakwita, of Hounslow Legal Service

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Ms T is a citizen of Zimbabwe whose date of birth is recorded  as  [  ]
    1997. She made application for entry clearance in order that she  might
    join her parents in the United Kingdom having regard to Section EC-C of
    Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.  On 28 October  2013  a  decision
    was made to refuse that application which decision  was  maintained  on
    review by the Entry Clearance Manager on 7 February 2014.

 2. Ms T appealed and on 6 October 2014 her appeal was heard  by  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Owens.

 3. The basis upon which the Secretary of State refused the application was
    that both of Ms T's parents held only discretionary leave in the United
    Kingdom and therefore did not meet the  requirements  of  Paragraph  E-
    ECC.1.6 which provides:-

           "One of the Applicant's parents must be in the UK  with  limited
           leave to enter or remain, or be applying, or have  applied,  for
           entry clearance as a partner or a  parent  under  this  appendix
           (referred to in the section as the "Applicant's Parent") and

           a)     The Applicant's parent' partner under Appendix FM is also
                  a parent of the Applicant: or

           b) The Applicant's parent has had and  continues  to  have  sole
                  responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

           c)  There  are  serious   and   compelling   family   or   other
                  considerations  which  make   exclusion   of   the   child
                  undesirable and suitable arrangements have been  made  for
                  the child's care."

 4. Judge Owens gave weight to the fact that both Sponsors had been  issued
    with residence permits which he said, stated they had:  "Limited  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom."  In fact the  residence  permits  did
    not say that at all but simply say  "Leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom". At my invitation both cards were produced and shown to me  in
    the light of what  Judge  Owens  had  said  at  paragraphs  23  of  his
    Statement of Reasons.  Judge Owens looked to the  policy  guidance  and
    found notwithstanding the documentary evidence to the contrary that  Ms
    T's parents had in fact been granted limited leave to remain.

 5. Not content with the decision allowing the appeal, by notice  dated  20
    November 2014 the Secretary of State made application for permission to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The Secretary of State submitted that Ms
    T's parents had been granted discretionary leave pursuant to  Paragraph
    353B. The Secretary of State further challenged the weight given by the
    judge to what was said on the permits.  Additionally the  Secretary  of
    State took issue with the judge's finding that  the  parents  had  sole
    responsibility but a condition precedent to that, under the rules would
    be in any event that one of Ms T's parents had to have limited leave.

 6. On 9 January 2015 Judge Holmes  granted  permission.  Thus  the  matter
    comes before me.

 7. Ms Kyakwita took me through the chronology.  She drew my  attention  to
    there having been a history of refugee status having been claimed  with
    various proceedings following but  with  appeal  rights  having  become
    exhausted on 6 May 2010.  There  were  further  submissions  lodged  in
    August 2010 and September 2011.  In each case those submissions seeking
    still refugee status were rejected.  The 2010 submissions were met with
    a refusal dated 11 March 2011 in which it was said that no leave  would
    be granted.  The further submissions of 6 September 2011 were met  with
    a letter dated 24 January 2013 stating "... However a decision has been
    taken  that  it  would  be  appropriate,  because  of  the   particular
    circumstances of your case, to grant you leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom on a discretionary basis outside the Immigration  Rules  for  a
    specified period."

 8. Ms Savage pointed out that that discretionary leave  had  been  granted
    under Paragraph 353B.  Ms Kyakwita conceded that it  was  open  to  the
    Secretary of State to grant discretionary leave rather than any limited
    leave if she chose to do so and it was clear in my judgment on the face
    of the papers that that is what had happened.  The observation  of  the
    judge below that limited leave was evidenced by the  residence  permits
    was patently wrong.  The residence cards said no such thing.

 9. There is clear authority that an appeal cannot be brought in respect of
    a decision under 353B before the Tribunal: Khanum and Others (Paragraph
    353B) [2013]  UKUT  00311  (IAC).   Whether  the  Sponsors  had  remedy
    elsewhere was a matter in respect of which I was not concerned  but  it
    seems to me that there is no basis whatsoever for a  finding  that  the
    Sponsors had any leave other than that which was granted to them.   If,
    the judge was for saying that the decision against which the appeal was
    brought was not in accordance with the law then the proper  basis  upon
    which the appeal should have been allowed was pursuant to Section 86(3)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. That  is  not  how
    the matter was put before me.  In any event for the reasons that I have
    stated, it is clear that the judge simply erred and  his  decision  was
    infected in my judgment from wrongly reading the residence permits.

10. The judge further erred by considering the policy guidance in  relation
    to decisions to grant leave on Article 8 on or after 9 July 2012.  What
    Judge Owens appears to have failed to recognise was that the leave  was
    not granted because of Article 8 but because the Secretary of State  in
    the exercise of her discretion decided  to  grant  discretionary  leave
    pursuant to Paragraph 353B of the Immigration Rules.  A grant of  leave
    under Paragraph 353B is entirely discretionary and indeed  so  much  so
    that a decision not to grant leave pursuant to that paragraph is, as  I
    have already observed not justiciable: Khanum.   If  therefore  Ms  T's
    parents considered the status that had been  granted  to  them  in  the
    discretion of the Secretary of State was wrong then it was not for this
    Tribunal  to  deal  with  the  matter.   It  may  be,  and  I  make  no
    observations as to whether such application would have  been  met  with
    success, that it was open to Ms T's parents to seek a remedy in another
    venue but that is not a matter for me.  As  it  is  the  judge  plainly
    erred and the decision is to be set aside and remade.

The Remaking

11.  It is well established that the material  date  for  the  purposes  of
    remaking this decision and indeed the decision in  the  first  instance
    was the date of the decision itself and not the  date  of  the  hearing
    either before the First-tier Tribunal or before me as to which  see  AS
    Somalia [2009] UKHL 32.  It is for Ms T to demonstrate  on  balance  of
    probabilities that her family or private life is being interfered  with
    by the decision of the Secretary of State and it is for  the  Secretary
    of  State  to  demonstrate,  again  to  the  civil  standard  that  any
    interference  is  justified.   Whether  one  takes   as   the   guiding
    principles, that line of cases  including  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  00640
    (IAC) or R (On the application of MM) (Lebanon) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ  985,  the  starting  point  in
    determining where the public interest  lies  is  to  be  found  in  the
    Immigration Rules  themselves.   I  remind  myself  however  given  the
    guidance in the case of Dube (SS117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC) that  I
    ought still to put to myself the five questions set out in the case  of
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

12. I heard evidence from Ms B.  She is the mother of Ms  T.   She  adopted
    her witness statement of 6 October  2014.   She  confirms  her  history
    being that she came to the United Kingdom in 2002 as a visitor and then
    extended her stay as a student.  Various applications were made for  Ms
    T's to come to the United Kingdom and these were concurrent,  it  would
    seem, with other applications that were made on the basis of  it  being
    said that there was a risk of persecution.

13. The last time that Ms B saw Ms T was twelve years ago  when  Ms  T  was
    only five years of age.  However, arrangements were made for  Ms  T  to
    continue her schooling with various friends both  through  primary  and
    secondary school.  Ms T also has an aunt who has been looking after the
    financial aspects of matters.  Money was sent to  that  aunt  from  the
    United Kingdom.  Ms B expressed to me her concern at having two of  her
    children here in the United Kingdom with Ms T being the only  child  of
    the family who is not in the United Kingdom. In the  course  of  cross-
    examination it was put to Ms B that it was always open to her to  visit
    Ms T in Zimbabwe but she said  that  currently  her  son  was  ten  and
    studying for his 11+ examinations and so she had no  plans  to  travel.
    Whilst I note that evidence, for  the  reasons  set  out  above,  I  am
    concerned with matters as they were at the date of decision rather  any
    developments which have occurred since then.

14. Ms T's father also gave evidence by way of a witness  statement  though
    he was not called.  In every material particular  however  the  witness
    statement is the same as that of Ms T's mother.

15. I have also had regard to a witness statement  from  EY.   She  is  the
    mother of Ms T's best  friend.   She  confirms  that  Ms  T  has  spent
    weekdays with EY and her family and then returns  at  weekends  to  the
    home of her aunt whose witness statement I have also read.

16. The material questions which arise from the guidance in Razgar  are  as
    follows:

           1. Will the proposed  removal  [in  this  case  refusal]  be  an
                 interference by a public authority with the exercise of the
                 applicant's right to respect for [her] private or  (as  the
                 case may be) family life?

           2. If so, will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
                 gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of  Article
                 8?

           3. If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

           4. If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society
                 in the interests of national security, public safety or the
                 economic wellbeing of the country, for  the  prevention  of
                 disorder or crime, for the protection of health or  morals,
                 or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

           5. If so, is such interference proportionate to  the  legitimate
                 public end sought to be achieved?

17. I accept that there is family life to be enjoyed between  the  Sponsors
    and Ms T and I accept further that Article 8 is not only to do with the
    maintenance of family life but also the facilitation of  it  such  that
    the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse admission to Ms T  has
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    Article 8.  At no point was it suggested on behalf of the Secretary  of
    State that that was not the case.  It was Ms Savage's  submission  that
    the rules reflected a balance and the Sponsor's had made a life  choice
    to remain in the United Kingdom.  The decision to refuse admission  was
    in fact no additional interference to the decision made by the Sponsors
    to come and then remain in the United Kingdom.  On behalf Ms T  it  was
    argued that she is 17 and I was also invited  to  have  regard  to  the
    application of her brother for British citizenship which application is
    pending.  Again however I  remind  myself  that  I  am  concerned  with
    matters as they were at the date of decision.  There was no  suggestion
    that at that time there was any application pending.

18. I turn to the third question and that is easily answered in  this  case
    in the affirmative.  The decision clearly is in accordance with the law
    and again it was not suggested otherwise.

19. I turn then as I must  to  the  Immigration  Rules  themselves  as  the
    starting point.  These are dealt with under Appendix FM at Section  EC-
    C: Entry Clearance of a Child.  The requirements are:-

           a) The applicant must be outside the United Kingdom;

           b) The  applicant  must  have  a  valid  application  for  entry
                 clearance as a child;

           c) The applicant must not fall for  refusal  under  any  of  the
                 grounds in Section S-EC: Suitability for  Entry  Clearance;
                 and

           d) The applicant must meet all the requirements  in  Section  E-
                 ECC: Eligibility for Entry Clearance as a Child.

20. E-ECC.1.6 provides that:

           "One of the applicant's parents must be in  the  United  Kingdom
           with limited leave to enter or remain, or be applying,  of  have
           applied, for entry clearance, as a partner  or  a  parent  under
           this appendix (referred to in this section as  the  "Applicant's
           parent" and

           a) The applicant's parents partner under Appendix FM is  also  a
                 parent of the applicant; or

           b) The applicant's parent has had and  continues  to  have  sole
                 responsibility to the child's upbringing, or

           c)  There  are  serious   and   compelling   family   or   other
                 considerations  which   make   exclusion   of   the   child
                 undesirable and suitable arrangements have  been  made  for
                 the child's care."

21. It will be observed that those factors which are set out in (a) to  (c)
    are only relevant in circumstances in  which  one  of  the  applicant's
    parents are in the United  Kingdom  with  limited  leave  to  enter  or
    remain.  The rule makes no  provision  in  the  case  of  discretionary
    leave.  That was the point taken by the Secretary of State in  refusing
    the application.

22. Matters do not end there however because regard is to  be  had  to  the
    financial requirements and in this case Ms  T's  father  was  found  at
    paragraph 31 of the  statement  of  reasons  of  Judge  Owens  to  have
    earnings of �23,490 and Ms T's mother  had  earnings  of  �6,200.   The
    threshold for the  financial  requirements  was  �27,200  so  that  the
    financial requirements were met.

23. When considering the issue of proportionality I am bound by law to have
    regard to those factors set out at Section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  There is little point  in  me  simply
    setting them out in the body of this decision but  I  do  observe  that
    made claim that I have regard to the entirety of 117B that  this  is  a
    family which speaks English; that the financial requirements appear  to
    have been met but on the other hand little weight is to be given  to  a
    private life established by a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
    immigration status is  precarious.   I  recognise  that  this  case  is
    advanced on the basis of family life but there is relevant private life
    aspects to the case too on the basis that  there  is  in  principle  no
    right to choose where family life is to be enjoyed.   I  bear  in  mind
    that there have been attempts to acquire refugee status in  the  United
    Kingdom.  I note that the Sponsor's status in the United Kingdom became
    appeals rights exhausted and I note that Ms B was  described  by  Judge
    Aujla in the determination  and  reasons  following  the  appeal  on  4
    January 2010 to be an unreliable witness.  The judge went on to say:

           "I have considered the Appellant's account with the most anxious
           scrutiny.  I do not find the Appellant to be a witness of truth.
            I find that the Appellant has made the asylum claim solely  for
           the purpose of obtaining status in the United Kingdom.   I  find
           that she has advanced a wholly fabricated account in support  of
           her asylum claim."

24. I attach considerable weight in considering the  Article  8  aspect  of
    this case outside of  the  Immigration  Rules  to  the  fact  that  the
    Sponsors only have discretionary leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
    In giving significant weight to the legitimate public end sought to  be
    achieved, namely effective immigration control which is by  statute  in
    the public interest, there must be sufficient countervailing factors to
    justify the issue of proportionality being weighed  in  favour  of  the
    person seeking entry clearance albeit a  family  member  and  albeit  a
    minor.

25. On the basis of the type of leave  granted,  it  remains  open  to  the
    Sponsor to go back to Zimbabwe or join her  family  member  in  another
    country.  That the appeals  for  international  protection  and  indeed
    earlier  appeals  on  human  rights  bases   have   been   unsuccessful
    demonstrate that there  is,  by  judicial  finding,  no  impediment  to
    departure  from  the   United   Kingdom   other   than   private   life
    considerations to which, by statute little weight is to  be  given  and
    all the more so if that private life  has  been  established  when  the
    immigration status was precarious as indeed was the case here.

26. Although I accept that the Sponsors have set up a life  for  themselves
    in the United Kingdom and have now been granted discretionary leave,  I
    do not find that there are sufficient countervailing factors even  when
    I put the best interests of Ms T  in  the  mix.  Ms  T's  education  is
    continuing and sufficient provision has been made for her welfare.   If
    in the best interests of the child are that she  should  be  with  both
    parents then that is matter  for  her  parents  to  resolve  and  still
    further if the best interests of the family are for the  family  to  be
    together then there is a solution to that open to the Sponsors  and  Ms
    T. Family life, such as it is, has continued for some  years  with  the
    family separated. The best interests of the  child  are  not  a  "trump
    card" see: Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74.

27. For these reasons I find that the decision of the  Secretary  of  State
    was proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued and that in these
    circumstances the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal  is  to  be  remade
    such that the appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.
The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and  remade  such  that
the appeal is dismissed.
