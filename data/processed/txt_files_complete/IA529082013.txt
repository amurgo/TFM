                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Buckwell promulgated on 11th September 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a female Indian citizen born 23rd April  1991  who  on
    4th October 2013 applied for further leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

 3. The application was refused on 3rd  December  2013  with  reference  to
    paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules.  The  Respondent  did  not
    award  the  ten  points  claimed  by  the  Appellant  in  relation   to
    maintenance on the basis that the Appellant had not proved that she was
    in possession of �7,200 for a consecutive 28 day period.

 4. This was because, as evidence of funds, the Appellant  had  provided  a
    letter from Catholic Syrian Bank dated  4th  October  2013,  confirming
    that she had been  given  a  loan  of  750,000  rupees,  equivalent  to
    �7,489.56.  The Respondent  decided  that  this  was  not  satisfactory
    evidence of funds with reference to paragraph 1B(d)(7) of Appendix C of
    the Immigration Rules which provides;

         "(7) the loan is provided by the national government, the state  or
             regional government or a  government  sponsored  student  loan
             company or  is  part  of  an  academic  or  educational  loans
             scheme."

 5. The Respondent explained that;

         "As your loan is through  a  bank  and  not  through  a  government
         controlled loan scheme and we  have  no  proof  that  the  loan  is
         government sanctioned, we cannot consider the loan to be  proof  of
         funds."

 6. The Appellant's appeal was heard by Judge Buckwell (the judge) on  14th
    August 2014.  The only issue before the judge was whether the  proposed
    loan was part of an academic or educational loans  scheme.   The  judge
    found there was no evidence to show that the proposed loan was anything
    other than a free-standing loan to a customer or client.  There was  no
    evidence to show that the loan was part of an academic  or  educational
    loans scheme.  The appeal was therefore dismissed.

 7. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    contending that the judge had erred in law and that the letter from the
    bank dated 4th October 2013 had specifically referred to the loan being
    a "loan for educational purpose".  It was contended that this satisfied
    the requirements of paragraph 1B(d)(7) of Appendix C.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Levin, and the Tribunal  issued  directions  that  there  should  be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal  to  decide  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal determination should be set aside.

The Appellant's Submissions

 9.  Mr  Sreevalsalan  relied  upon  the  grounds  contained   within   the
    application for permission to appeal, contending that the  letter  from
    the bank clarified that the loan was for an educational  purpose  which
    sufficed to satisfy the Immigration Rules, and  pointed  out  that  the
    Respondent's guidance did not define the meaning  of  "an  academic  or
    educational loans scheme."

The Respondent's Submissions

10. Mr Parkinson agreed he could find no  definition  of  "an  academic  or
    educational loan scheme" but relied upon a Rule 24 response dated  12th
    November 2014 in contending that the judge had not erred in law.  I was
    asked to find that there was no evidence that the loan was  part  of  a
    scheme, and therefore the judge did not err in making that finding, and
    the appeal must fail.

11. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

12. The judge did not err in law in dismissing the appeal.  I could find no
    definition of an academic or educational loans scheme  in  any  of  the
    guidance provided by the Respondent in relation to Tier 4 applications.
     Both representatives confirmed that they too had been unable  to  find
    any definition.

13. The judge did not entirely agree with the reasons for refusal given  by
    the Respondent which seemed to indicate the loan had to  be  government
    sanctioned.  The judge analysed the letter  from  the  Catholic  Syrian
    Bank and noted that the letter  referred  to  a  loan  application  for
    "education purpose" but was correct to find that no evidence  had  been
    provided that this loan was part of "an academic or  educational  loans
    scheme."

14. The judge was entitled to conclude that there was no evidence  to  show
    that the proposed loan was anything other than a free-standing loan  to
    a customer or client for an educational purpose, and to  conclude  that
    the evidence contained no reference whatsoever to the bank operating an
    academic or educational loans scheme.  The burden of proof when proving
    such a scheme exists rests on the Appellant, and the judge was entitled
    to find that the burden had not  been  discharged,  and  gave  adequate
    reasons for his finding.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not include  an  error  of
law.

I do not set aside the decision, which stands.  The appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

No order for anonymity was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.
