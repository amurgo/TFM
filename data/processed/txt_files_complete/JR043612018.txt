                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -



    JUDGE SMITH: This is an application for judicial review challenging the
    Respondent's decisions dated 14 March 2018 and 24 April  2018  refusing
    an application for indefinite leave to  remain  ("ILR")  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant and upholding that decision following an  application
    for administrative review.  Permission was refused  on  the  papers  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge King on 28  November  2018,  but  granted  by  Mrs
    Justice Farbey sitting as an Upper Tribunal Judge at a renewal  hearing
    on 16 January 2019.  Her reasons for granting permission were  that  it
    is arguable that the Respondent  has  misdirected  himself  in  law  by
    deploying paragraph 322(5) in circumstances  where  the  administrative
    review disavows any dishonesty on the part of the  Applicant  (see  the
    guidance given by Martin Spencer J in R (Khan)  v  Secretary  of  State
    [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC)).  I begin with the facts of the case.


 1. The Applicant is a national  of  India.   He  came  to  the  UK  on  27
    September 2006 as a student with leave to 29 February 2008.  His  leave
    was extended to 30 May 2009.  He was then granted further  leave  as  a
    Tier 1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant  until  19  April  2016.   A  first
    application for ILR was refused on 13  April  2016.   He  then  made  a
    further application for ILR as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant on  28  April
    2016.  He was interviewed in relation to that  application  on  12  May
    2017.  The application was refused by the first of the decisions  under
    challenge on 13 March 2018 ("the First Decision").

 2. Following an application for administrative review the  first  decision
    was upheld on 24 April 2018 ("the Second Decision").

 3. The Respondent's reasons for refusing  the  application  were  twofold.
    First, the Respondent concluded that the  Applicant's  current  claimed
    earnings were not genuine, applying paragraph 19 of Appendix A  to  the
    Immigration Rules.  That conclusion was itself predicated on the second
    of the reasons, namely that it was not desirable to grant  ILR  because
    of the Applicant's character and conduct.  The second of those  reasons
    turns  on  discrepancies  between  the  amounts  of  income  which  the
    Applicant declared to HMRC  in  his  tax  returns  when  compared  with
    amounts declared to the Respondent for the purposes of obtaining  leave
    to remain in earlier applications.

 4. There are two discrepancies relied upon by the Respondent.   First,  in
    an application made on 31 March 2011 for leave as a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant the Applicant declared that his income for the period  1  March
    2010 to  28  February  2011  was  �43,482.96  consisting  of  �5,952.95
    salaried income and �37,530.00 received as the director  of  a  limited
    company of which he is the sole director.  For the tax  year  ending  5
    April 2011 however the Applicant declared a total income of  �26,668.00
    made up of dividends of �26,666.00 (plus 10% tax credit)  and  interest
    of �2.00 from bank accounts.

 5. Similarly, in an  application  made  on  5  April  2013  the  Applicant
    declared that his income for the period 1 March  2012  to  28  February
    2013 was �40,525.16  consisting  of  �15,284.16  salaried  income,  and
    �25,241.00 income received as a director, whereas he declared  to  HMRC
    for the tax year ending 5 April 2013 that he received a total income of
    �19,471.00 made up of �13,916.00 from salaried employment and dividends
    of �5,555.00 (plus 10% tax credit).

 6. The Applicant was put on notice as to the discrepancies in response  to
    his first application and therefore when making his second  application
    he provided a letter from an accountant which was not  the  firm  which
    submitted the tax returns on his behalf  ("the  Accountant's  letter").
    When interviewed  about  the  errors  in  the  context  of  the  second
    application the Applicant blamed the accountant who submitted  the  tax
    returns ("the First Accountant").  He said that he had been chasing the
    First Accountant for an explanation which the  accountant  had  so  far
    failed to provide.  The Applicant also confirmed that he had  seen  and
    signed all tax returns before they were submitted to HMRC.  He did  not
    apparently notice the discrepancies and did not seek to amend  his  tax
    returns until after his second  ILR  application,  but  before  he  was
    interviewed.

 7. The Applicant has sought  to  expand  on  his  explanation  by  witness
    statement dated 29 March 2019.  This is  an  application  for  judicial
    review; it is not an appeal.  I can only take account of evidence which
    was before the Respondent as  at  the  date  of  the  First  or  Second
    Decisions as Mr Gajjar accepted.

 8. In the application for administrative review lengthy  submissions  were
    made about the test for dishonesty, but no explanation  was  given  for
    the errors, no letter was produced  from  the  accountant  said  to  be
    responsible for the errors, and no  statement  was  produced  from  the
    Applicant himself.  I will come on to deal with his explanation in more
    detail when I look at the Decisions and  the  Applicant's  response  to
    them.

 9. The Applicant pursues three grounds of challenge as follows:

    Ground 1

    Given that the Respondent has expressly  disavowed  any  allegation  of
    dishonesty,  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Rules  cannot  apply  and  the
    Decisions cannot stand.

    Ground 2

    The Decisions applying paragraph 322(5) are irrational.  Mr Gajjar says
    that this arises only if I am not  with  the  Applicant  on  ground  1,
    although for reasons I will come to in a minute, this ground may  still
    require to be determined.

    Ground 3

    The Decisions applying paragraphs 19(i) and (j) of Appendix  A  to  the
    Rules are irrational.  Both parties accept that whether I find  for  or
    against the Applicant on the first two grounds, I do not need  to  deal
    with ground 3.  That ground would either be academic if I find for  the
    Applicant on the first two grounds or would not enable him  to  succeed
    if I find for the Respondent.  I need say no more about that ground.

10. Although the grant of permission is predicated firmly on  ground  1,  I
    accept that the grant of permission is not limited and therefore I need
    to deal with grounds 1 and 2.

11. Although Mr Gajjar is right  to  point  out  that  if  I  am  with  the
    Applicant on ground 1, ground 2 may not arise, it will still do so  if,
    as the Respondent submits, I need to consider  Section  31(2A)  of  the
    Senior Courts Act 1981 when determining whether to grant relief.

12. Before turning to the Decisions under challenge I set out some  of  the
    background to those Decisions.  First, when the Respondent refused  the
    first ILR application made by the Applicant, the Respondent said this:-

         "The Secretary of State considers that it would be undesirable  for
         you to remain in the United Kingdom based on the fact that you have
         been deceitful or dishonest in your dealings with  HMRC  and/or  UK
         Visas & Immigration  by  failing  to  declare  your  claimed  self-
         employed  earnings  to  HMRC  at  the  time   and/or   by   falsely
         representing your self-employed income to obtain leave to remain in
         the United Kingdom.   Your  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
         remain in the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  is
         therefore refused under paragraph 245CD with reference to paragraph
         322(5) of the Immigration Rules."

13. The Applicant was therefore on notice that  the  Respondent  considered
    his  conduct  to  be  deceitful  or  dishonest   by   reason   of   the
    discrepancies.  Second, therefore, when making the  second  application
    the Applicant sought  to  overcome  this  difficulty.   He  did  so  by
    producing the Accountant's letter which, as I have already noted, comes
    from a firm of accountants other than the firm which submitted the  tax
    returns in question.  The Applicant's solicitors  included  a  covering
    letter to the application which stated as follows (so far as relevant):

         "In short, we consider that the requirements for  indefinite  leave
         are met, and that the basis for refusal set out in your  letter  of
         13th April 2016 has been addressed and answered  beyond  reasonable
         suspicion to the  contrary.   Please  consider  *Accountant  Letter
         dated 27th April 2016 as essential reading in this regard."

14. That paragraph might suggest that the reason for refusal based  on  the
    discrepancies had been met head-on in the earlier part of the  covering
    letter, but there is absolutely nothing in the remainder of the  letter
    which addresses the discrepancy or provides reasons for it.   There  is
    mention at (h) on page [C129]  of  the  Accountant's  Letter  which  is
    therefore shown to have been included.  The Accountant's Letter  itself
    appears at D16 to 17.   Since  that  is,  in  effect,  the  Applicant's
    explanation for the discrepant figures, it bears setting  out  in  some
    detail:

         "We have now reviewed management accounts for the  period  from  12
         April 2010 to 2 March 2011 and annual accounts  &  corporation  tax
         returns (CT600) of above company for the period from 12 April  2010
         to 30 September 2011 as detailed in Annexure-1.  You can  see  that
         there is slight increase in most of expenditures after 2 March 2011
         but major increase is due to inclusion of your salary of �3,700  in
         this period which seems reasonable and justifiable.

         As per HMRC rules, when accounting period is more than  12  months,
         figures of annual accounts are apportioned into 2  CT600s.   Please
         find below summary of 2 CT600s  which  is  consistent  with  annual
         accounts for the period from 12 April 2010 to 30 September 2011."

    Figures are then set out for the two CT600s with a turnover and  profit
    figure against each.  I note that there appears to be  a  typographical
    error in relation to the first of those periods which I infer from what
    precedes the table should read 12/4/2010 to 11/4/2011 (with the  second
    period being 12/4/2011 to 30/9/2011), but nothing turns on that.   That
    deals with the turnover and profit figures of the company which  is  of
    course a separate legal entity.

15. The Accountant's Letter continues as follows:

         "We confirm that sole shareholder of a company is entitled for  the
         entire profit of the company.  Companies normally pay to owners  in
         the shape of salary &  dividends  and  retain  profits  for  future
         growth so value  of  dividends  is  less  than  value  of  profits.
         However, in self assessment return  of  director/shareholder,  only
         salary and dividends are taken and retained profits of business are
         ignored till the time those are taken by director/shareholder."

    So far so good.  What was under consideration by the Respondent is what
    was declared by the Applicant in terms of his own earnings.  The letter
    goes on as follows:

         "In your case, company has paid you dividend  of  �24,000  until  5
         April 2011 which was grossed up �26,666  in  your  self  assessment
         return of 2010-11.  Home Office has mentioned  dividend  figure  of
         �20,193 which perhaps was calculated by them wrongly as  calculated
         below:...".

    I do not need to set out that calculation because it appears to  relate
    back to the decision in relation to the first ILR application  and  the
    figure of �26,666.00 which is given in that passage is  the  figure  on
    which the Secretary  of  State  relied  in  the  First  Decision.   The
    Accountant's Letter continues:

         "Further, the company has also paid  you  salary  of  �4,317  after
         management  accounts  period  ended  on  2/3/2011  which  has  been
         reported in self assessment return of 2011-12.

         It appears that Home Office is treating you as self  employed  sole
         trader and trying to compare figures reported in company management
         accounts with self assessment returns.

         As you were not satisfied with your previous accountant  and  still
         some information was missing with  you  for  2012-13  therefore  we
         would request HMRC to provide missing information to  conclude  our
         review.

         We  also  acknowledge  your   instructions   to   remove   innocent
         mistake(s), if any, as a result of our review and deal with HMRC to
         update their records.

         Please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact  if  you  need   any   other
         information."

16. As will be immediately evident when comparing the  Accountant's  Letter
    with the discrepancies to which  I  have  referred,  this  letter  does
    nothing to answer the Home Office's points.  First, the  figures  given
    for profits do not equate to the figure to which the Applicant said  he
    was entitled as a director.  Second, the Accountant's Letter apparently
    confirms that the amounts declared to HMRC for 2010/2011  are  correct.
    Mr Gajjar confirmed on instructions that this was the case.  If that is
    so there is still no explanation for the  figures  given  to  the  Home
    Office as declaration of the Applicant's income in the  relevant  year.
    Mr Gajjar was unable to point me to any explanation in the Accountant's
    Letter to show how one gets from �26,666.00 being the  amount  declared
    to HMRC to �37,530.00 as declared to the Home Office.   If  the  figure
    had been that declared to HMRC a question mark would arise  as  to  the
    Applicant's entitlement to leave to remain in the relevant year.  It is
    also not clear why, if there are no errors in the amounts  declared  to
    HMRC, as  the  accountants  appear  to  assert,  the  Applicant  sought
    thereafter to amend his tax returns.   The  Applicant  apparently  paid
    �6,277.00 to HMRC on 25 July 2016.  Nor is the discrepancy  in  2012-13
    explained.

17. The Applicant was interviewed about his application in  May  2017.   In
    relation to the discrepancies the following questions and answers  were
    given:

         "Q34.    When you applied to extend your leave to remain under Tier
                  1 in 2011 you claimed  total  self  employed  earnings  of
                  �37,530 and in 2013  you  claimed  a  total  self-employed
                  earnings of �25,241.  Is this correct?

         A.   Yes.

         Q35.  As  part  of  our  case  working  process,  we  have   sought
                  information from HMRC in relation to your earnings.   HMRC
                  records show that you have declared total earnings of:

              �24,000 for the 2010-11 tax year.

              �5,000 for the 2012-13 tax year.

              Please provide an explanation for this discrepancy.

         A.   Well it was the accountants fault Haynes Watts.

              They have not provided me with an explanation letter  i  (sic)
                  have been chasing them up.

         Q36. Did you have  sight  of  the  tax  returns  before  they  were
                  submitted to HMRC?

         A.   Yes.

         Q37. Did you sign the tax returns before  they  were  submitted  to
                  HMRC?

         A.   Yes.

         Q38. As you are self employed  you  are  responsible  for  any  tax
                  declarations made to HMRC - why did you not  identify  the
                  large discrepancies in net profit when  you  reviewed  the
                  self assessment  form  that  had  been  produced  by  your
                  accountant?

         A.   Err i (sic) am not a tax expert i (sic) relied on them.

         Q39. What was the name of the  accountant  who  prepared  your  tax
                  return for year end 2011 and 2013?

         A.   Haines Watt Bedford branch Roger Hammond is senior partner.

         Q40. The years in which you did not make an application to the Home
                  Office also show significant drops in declared income.

              Eg

              2011-12 PAYE = �5,219 and self employment = �4,317.

              Why is this?

         A.   I was fully employed in my job that is why i (sic) did not  do
                  as much self employed work."

18. Turning then to the First  Decision  the  Respondent  referred  to  the
    content of the interview as I have set out.  The  Respondent  then  set
    out the discrepancies relied upon which I have already explained.   The
    Respondent pointed out that the discrepancies  were  in  the  order  of
    �10,864.00 in relation to the first and �19,686.00 in relation  to  the
    second.  The Respondent also considered whether any of the error  might
    be due to a difference  between  financial  accounting  years  and  tax
    years, but noted that for the tax  year  2011-12,  i.e.  the  tax  year
    between the two  returns  which  were  discrepant,  the  Applicant  had
    declared no dividend income.  (I pause to note, in light of what I have
    just said, that it is the difference in dividend income  on  which  the
    Secretary of State was relying and not the difference in salary.)

19. The First Decision continues as follows:-

         "You have confirmed at interview you had sight and signed your  tax
         returns before submission to HMRC.  It is reasonable to expect  you
         would have been aware of the significant discrepancies between  the
         earnings claimed to UKVI and the income declared to HMRC  for  self
         assessment during the tax years relevant to your Tier  1  (General)
         Migrant applications.

         Careful consideration has been given to the  information  you  have
         provided to UKVI and the information  you  have  provided  to  HMRC
         about your income/dividends in the United Kingdom.  It is clear the
         information   you   provided   to   HMRC   about    your    company
         profit/dividends was significantly different to the information you
         provided to UKVI during your Tier 1 (General) Migrant applications.

         The Secretary of State is satisfied that the company  earnings  you
         had claimed to UKVI in your initial and extension Tier 1  (General)
         Migrant applications are not consistent with your declarations made
         to HMRC in  the  relevant  tax  period.   The  fact  your  declared
         earnings to UKVI in your  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  applications
         dated 31 March 2011  and  05  April  2013,  compared  to  what  you
         declared to HMRC for a similar period  differ  significantly,  does
         not demonstrate that your declaration of earnings to both UKVI  and
         HMRC are consistent.

         Had you claimed company earnings in your Tier 1  (General)  Migrant
         applications dated 31 March 2011 and 05 April 2013 to  UKVI,  which
         were consistent with your income declarations to  HMRC,  you  would
         not have scored sufficient points under the Immigration  Rules  for
         leave to remain to be granted.

         Based on  your  actions,  when  submitting  your  previous  Tier  1
         (General) Migrant applications in declaring  different  amounts  of
         income/earnings to HMRC and UKVI, we therefore are of  the  opinion
         that you have either misrepresented your income to HMRC in order to
         reduce your tax liability or provided false information about  your
         earnings to UKVI in order to obtain leave to remain, or both.

         Furthermore the tax discrepancies outlined  above  concerning  your
         previous applications lead us to question the  credibility  of  the
         company earnings/dividends you have claimed in your current Tier  1
         (General)  Migrant  indefinite   leave   to   remain   application.
         Therefore on the balance of probability for  the  reasons  outlined
         above the Secretary  of  State  is  not  satisfied  that  the  self
         employed earnings you have claimed in  your  current  and  previous
         Tier 1 (General) Migrant applications are genuine."

20. Having set out paragraph 322(5) the Respondent continued:

         "The Secretary of  State  has  considered  whether  the  particular
         circumstances of  your  case  merit  the  exercise  of  discretion.
         Having considered those circumstances the  Secretary  of  State  is
         satisfied that the refusal remains appropriate and is not  prepared
         to exercise discretion in your favour.

         Your actions in declaring different amounts of income to  HMRC  and
         UKVI lead to the conclusion that in light  of  your  character  and
         conduct it would be undesirable to  allow  you  to  remain  in  the
         United  Kingdom.   Your  character  and  conduct  with  regards  to
         declaring your income would lead to a refusal of  your  application
         under General Grounds Paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration  Rules.
         Whilst a refusal under Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules is
         not  a  mandatory  decision,  it  is  considered  your  actions  in
         declaring different income to HMRC  and  UKVI  would  mean  that  a
         refusal under Paragraph 322(5) is appropriate."

21. As I have already observed, the application for  administrative  review
    is general in terms of  its  criticisms  of  the  First  Decision.   In
    essence, the Applicant says that the Respondent is not entitled to rely
    on  the  discrepancies  as  evidence  of  deception  because  there  is
    insufficient proof that he intended to deceive.  My attention was drawn
    in particular to the following paragraphs:

         "The Applicants (sic) place further reliance on the recent case  of
         Ivey v Genting Casino Ltd  t/a  as  Crawfords  [2017]  UKSC  67  at
         paragraph 74 and the principles set out in AA (Nigeria) v Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 773.  Paragraph 32
         of the (sic) AA recites the Secretary of State's IDIs and concludes
         that burden of proof in relation to refusals paragraph 322  of  the
         Immigration Rules in cases with allegations of dishonesty lies with
         the caseworker.

         The decision also extracts from the IDIs that the standard of proof
         in  cases  where  dishonesty  is  alleged  is  to  the  balance  of
         probabilities which is higher than normal.

         It is plain from the Secretary of State's refusal  letter  and,  in
         particular, the extracts above that the test for dishonesty has not
         been made out.  At best, the Secretary of State can allege that the
         Applicant was negligent or reckless (both of which are  denied)  in
         failing to verify the work of his  accountants,  however,  in  line
         with Brunei, this falls squarely outside of Lord Nicholls'  defined
         boundaries of dishonesty.  As such, given the above, the  Applicant
         submits that the Secretary of State's decisions were irrational."

22. What the Applicant says specifically about the  First  Decision  is  as
    follows, so far as relevant:-

         "It is submitted that there is nothing in the refusal letter  which
         allows the Tribunal to be satisfied that the Secretary of State has
         properly applied her guidance.  The mere fact  that  the  Applicant
         amended his return, even when coupled with a potential  benefit  to
         the Applicant is not, the Applicant submits, enough to satisfy  the
         threshold prescribed in the guidance.  It is respectfully submitted
         that the Secretary of State's decisions display  an  indiscriminate
         decision to refuse this application without a proper application of
         the  burden  and  standard  of  proof  required  to  reach  such  a
         conclusion.   The  refusal  letter  is  simply  silent  as  to  the
         Applicant's explanation and evidence in rebuttal.

         In his case, the Applicant had provided letters from his accredited
         accountants, Iqbal & Co which had confirmed that the  Secretary  of
         State was wrongly comparing the company's management accounts  with
         his own accounts and appeared to wrongly treat him as self-employed
         at times.  It is also apparent from the letter from Iqbal & Co that
         the Applicant was not satisfied  with  the  work  of  his  previous
         accountant and  there  was  missing  information  which  was  being
         rectified.  It is troubling to note that  the  Secretary  of  State
         does not go so far as to even  mention  the  evidence  provided  by
         Iqbal & Co.  The Applicant draws attention to the  letter  from  27
         April 2016.

         It has also been repeatedly stated in correspondence  sent  to  the
         Secretary of State by this  firm  that  the  Applicant  had  stated
         during the interview that his previous accountants,  Haines  Watts,
         had made a mistake in relation to his previous accounts;  that  the
         outstanding dues had since been paid  to  HMRC  and  there  was  no
         longer any shortfall.  The Secretary of State is invited to explain
         why the refusal letter is silent on all of these issues.

         Insofar as the above-extracted guidance is concerned, the Applicant
         submits that the Secretary of State has irrationally turned a blind
         eye to the fact that the Applicant had submitted various other  tax
         returns and those were not found to be dishonest or discrepant.  As
         such, it is submitted that the evidence, when viewed in the  round,
         did not point towards a man who  had  repeatedly  and  consistently
         declared his income to the Secretary of State.

         This is a case where the Secretary of  State  has  also  failed  to
         request any further evidence."

23. The Applicant  also  says  that  he  has  been  unable  to  obtain  any
    explanation from the First Accountant who submitted  the  relevant  tax
    returns on his behalf in spite of chasing him for this.  That may  well
    imply that the First Accountant does not accept responsibility for  the
    errors.  The Applicant has made a complaint about the First  Accountant
    but did not do so until 24 March 2019.  As with his statement,  I  take
    no  account  of  that  action.   This  was  not  evidence  before   the
    Respondent.

24. Turning then to how the Respondent addressed the  submissions  made  in
    the administrative review application and the Accountant's Letter,  the
    Second Decision reads as follows, so far as relevant:

         "You claim you have taken immediate steps  to  rectify  the  issues
         surrounding your previous tax returns.  You contend your intentions
         are clear and took the necessary steps to  make  matters  right  by
         obtaining a new accountant.  To support your claims you  state  you
         have submitted a letter from Iqbal & Co  accountants  which  states
         you have  not  been  satisfied  by  the  work  from  your  previous
         accountant and that the Secretary of State  has  incorrectly  treat
         (sic) you as self employed at times.

         Careful consideration has been given to the  information  you  have
         provided to UKVI and the information you have provided to  HMRC  in
         regards to your income.  We have also acknowledged your attempts in
         paying  your  outstanding  taxes.   However,  the  fact  you   have
         retrospectively made attempts and amended the tax returns does  not
         satisfy the Secretary of State that your previous  earnings  claims
         to the Home Office and HMRC were consistent.

         It is considered your responsibility to ensure that your tax return
         was submitted on time with the correct information.   An  applicant
         has responsibility for their own tax affairs and from the  evidence
         submitted it is clear  you  had  to  pay  additional  tax  on  your
         earnings.  Furthermore, an accountant will  only  compete  (sic)  a
         submission based on the information and evidence provided to  them.
         The fact there were differences in information you provided to UKVI
         and the omission to declare your earnings on time to HMRC  is  your
         responsibility.   Therefore,  the  fact  that  late  returns   were
         submitted to HMRC is sufficient to satisfy the Secretary  of  State
         that a refusal under 322(5) is appropriate."

     The Second Decision later goes on to say:

         "You state the  Secretary  of  State  has  made  an  allegation  of
         dishonesty and failed to  engage  with  your  decision  and  cherry
         picked the aspects  of  the  interview.   You  state  the  test  of
         dishonesty was established in Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd  V  tan
         (sic) [1995] UKPC 4 and R v Ghosh [1982] Qb.

         You also rely on the recent case of Ivey v Genting Casino  Ltd  t/a
         Crawfords [2017] UKSC 67 and the case of AA (Nigeria) v SSHD [2010]
         EWCA civ (sic) 773 stating the burden of proof in cases where there
         is dishonesty lies with the caseworker.

         However a review  of  the  original  caseworker's  decision  letter
         confirms that  there  were  no  direct  accusations  of  dishonesty
         against you.  Rather the original  caseworker  highlights  concerns
         over your character and conduct, essentially due to your failure to
         report your tax liability accurately.  Therefore we do  not  accept
         your assertion that there is a responsibility on the Home Office to
         discharge the burden of proving dishonesty, as  no  accusation  was
         raised in the first instance.  For this reason the above  mentioned
         case laws do not apply."

25.  This  is  a  judicial  review.   The  issue  for  me  is  whether  the
    Respondent's  Decisions  are  "Wednesbury  unreasonable"  or  otherwise
    unlawful.  The leading authority dealing with this line of  immigration
    cases is R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018]  UKUT
    384 (IAC), a decision  of  Mr  Justice  Spencer  sitting  as  an  Upper
    Tribunal Judge.  His guidance bears setting  out  in  full  as  to  the
    general approach to cases of this nature:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
                income claimed in a previous application for leave to remain
                and the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of  State  is
                entitled to draw an inference that the  Applicant  has  been
                deceitful or dishonest and therefore he  should  be  refused
                ILR within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.   Such
                an inference could be expected where there is  no  plausible
                explanation for the discrepancy.

         (ii) Where an  Applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
                despite the prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
                dishonest but only careless, then  the  Secretary  of  State
                must  decide  whether  the  explanation  and   evidence   is
                sufficient,  in  her  view,  to  displace  the  prima  facie
                inference of deceit/dishonesty.

         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
                State should remind herself that, although the  standard  of
                proof is the 'balance of  probability',  a  finding  that  a
                person has been deceitful and dishonest in relation  to  his
                tax  affairs  with  the  consequence  that  he   is   denied
                settlement in this country is a very  serious  finding  with
                serious consequences.

         (iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for  an
                "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be
                the end of the matter, given that  the  accountant  will  or
                should have asked the tax payer to confirm that  the  return
                was accurate and to have signed the tax return.  Furthermore
                the Applicant will have known of his  or  her  earnings  and
                will have expected to pay tax  thereon.   If  the  Applicant
                does not take steps within a reasonable time to  remedy  the
                situation,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  be  entitled  to
                conclude that this failure justifies a conclusion that there
                has been deceit or dishonesty.

         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
                merely careless the Secretary of State should  consider  the
                following matters, inter alia, as  well  as  the  extent  to
                which they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

                i. Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                      is plausible;

                ii.    Whether the documentation which  can  be  assumed  to
                      exist  (for  example,  correspondence   between   the
                      Applicant and his accountant at the time of  the  tax
                      return) has been disclosed or there  is  a  plausible
                      explanation for why it is missing;

                iii.        Why the Applicant did not realise that an  error
                      had been made because his liability to  pay  tax  was
                      less than he should have expected;

                iv.    Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps
                      to remedy the situation and, if so, when those  steps
                      were taken and the explanation  for  any  significant
                      delay."

26. Reliance is also placed by the Applicant in relation to ground 1 on the
    case  of  Habib  v  Secretary  of  State  for   the   Home   Department
    (JR/1638/2018) which is a decision of the President and Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Perkins.   In  that  case  the  Tribunal  held  that  it  is  not
    sufficient in cases of this nature for the Respondent to rely on a lack
    of suitability.  The Respondent has to show that  he  has  placed  some
    reliance on an applicant's dishonesty and established  that  dishonesty
    on the evidence.  Both parties referred me to additional cases which  I
    will deal with as and when  they  arise  in  my  consideration  of  the
    grounds.

27. Starting then with ground 1, I accept that if all that were  before  me
    was the  Second  Decision  it  would  be  difficult  to  say  that  the
    Respondent has relied on the Applicant's dishonesty.  Mr  Malik  sought
    to argue that the Applicant has  not  understood  the  Second  Decision
    because the reference to not relying on dishonesty or deception  (which
    Mr Malik accepts are the same things) is to be construed in the context
    of what is said in the application for administrative review  and  must
    also be taken to refer to the current application.

28. I am afraid I cannot read the Second Decision  in  that  way.   If  the
    decision maker had said  that  the  case  law  did  not  apply  because
    paragraph 322(1) is not relied upon, I could understand the submission.
     Similarly, if the Second Decision had made plain that the reference to
    allegations of dishonesty referred to the present application  and  not
    the earlier ones, again I would accept the submission  (although  I  do
    not understand how that can be the  position  given  the  discrepancies
    relied upon).

29. The primary decision in Habib  was  in  very  similar  if  not  exactly
    equivalent terms to the First Decision here.  The Tribunal at  [21]  of
    Habib accepted that it  raised  an  allegation  of  dishonesty  by  its
    wording.  I should add that the  same  can  be  said  of  the  decision
    refusing the earlier application for ILR in this case.

30. As here, in Habib, character and conduct was relied upon by  the  maker
    of the Second Decision. That decision maker did not rely on accusations
    of dishonesty, although I do note that  what  is  said  in  the  Second
    Decision is slightly more  nuanced  because  it  refers  to  the  First
    Decision having raised "no direct accusations" which might  imply  that
    the Respondent maintained an allegation of overall dishonesty  but  did
    not rely on either of the declarations of  income  as  being  dishonest
    because the Secretary of State could not know which,  if  either,  were
    the genuine figures.

31. The conduct of the Respondent in this case, however, thereafter departs
    from the position in Habib.  In Habib the Tribunal made the point  that
    the detailed grounds were equivocal; here they are not.  I was referred
    in particular to [43] of the detailed grounds which is  unequivocal  in
    its reliance on dishonesty.  Although the summary grounds are  slightly
    more nuanced, they also rely on what is said in the First Decision.

32. I cannot accept, in any event, that what is said in the Second Decision
    can undermine what is a clear allegation of  dishonesty  in  the  First
    Decision so as to render the First Decision unlawful.  Insofar  as  the
    Respondent has disavowed reliance on such an allegation in  the  Second
    Decision, that would only lead to a quashing of that part of the Second
    Decision.  The respondent has not, as happened in Habib,  continued  to
    disavow reliance on dishonesty in the  First  Decision.   As  Mr  Malik
    emphasised, Habib is a case where the Respondent was relying solely  on
    suitability and not also dishonesty in defence of the  judicial  review
    challenge. That is not this case.

33. If, and insofar as the Second Decision seeks to characterise the  First
    Decision as one which did not rely on dishonesty, it is mistaken.  That
    misapprehension is corrected by the Respondent's  pleadings.   What  is
    said in the Second Decision about the First Decision cannot render  the
    First Decision unlawful unless the reasons given in the First  Decision
    taken by itself are irrational or otherwise unlawful.

34.  An  application  for  administrative  review  is  designed  to  permit
    applicants to bring to the Respondent's  attention  flaws  made  in  an
    earlier decision in the same way as a pre-action protocol letter  would
    do in cases where there is no administrative review.  If those flaws do
    not in fact or law exist,  then  the  decision  reviewing  the  earlier
    decision cannot affect the lawfulness of that  earlier  decision.   For
    those reasons I conclude that ground 1 is not made out.

35. That brings me on to  ground  2  and  whether  the  First  Decision  is
    irrational or otherwise unlawful.  In this regard  Mr  Gajjar  makes  a
    number of points.  First, he says  there  is  no  engagement  with  the
    Accountant's Letter. He points out that this was  produced  to  counter
    the allegations made in the response to the first  application  and  so
    was with the ILR application under consideration in the First Decision.
     The Accountant's Letter is not referred  to  in  the  First  Decision.
    Although it is referred to in the Second Decision, Mr Gajjar says  that
    this is infected by the wrong approach  being  taken.   In  the  Second
    Decision the Respondent refers continually to there being a  breach  of
    the Applicant's responsibility, but breach of a responsibility  is  not
    the same or tantamount to dishonesty.  I have already pointed  out  the
    difficulties with the Accountant's Letter which Mr Gajjar was unable to
    explain.  However, his  point  is  that  there  is  a  failure  by  the
    Respondent to engage with it and/or to ask for further explanation  if,
    as I think he accepted, the Accountant's Letter simply does not explain
    the discrepancies.

36. He submitted that in any event the Respondent should have engaged  with
    the explanation that the First Accountant was at fault.  He  also  said
    that since the Respondent had the documents on which  the  declarations
    of income to the Home Office relied, the Respondent ought also to  have
    engaged with those if he asserts that the Applicant  has  over-declared
    income to the Home Office.

37. Mr Gajjar referred me to the judgment of Upper Tribunal  Judge  Perkins
    in the case of Rahman v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    JR/278/2017 concerning the procedure adopted in this case which he says
    was unfair or otherwise deficient.  The Applicant was interviewed after
    production of the Accountant's Letter but was asked no questions  about
    it.  In response to Mr Malik's submission that Judge Perkins in  Rahman
    had concluded that the procedure in that case was not unfair, Mr Gajjar
    pointed out that any deficiency in the initial stages in  the  case  of
    Rahman was remedied by the Respondent's engagement with the explanation
    in  response  to  the  administrative  review  application.   Here  the
    Applicant was interviewed after production of the  Accountant's  letter
    but was asked no questions about it.

38. There is nothing in this point. True  it  is  that  the  Applicant  had
    already submitted the Accountant's Letter before the interview  because
    he was on notice as to the  discrepancies  relied  upon  and  that  the
    Respondent was alleging that his conduct was  dishonest  by  reason  of
    those  discrepancies.   However,  when  he  was  questioned  about  the
    discrepancies during the interview he could have but  did  not  mention
    the Accountant's Letter at all.  He continued to  insist  that  he  was
    trying to get a letter from the First Accountant accepting that he  was
    to blame, but had not managed to do so.   As I have already  noted,  if
    the Accountant's Letter were correct in its analysis of  the  position,
    the First Accountant did not make any errors in the tax return  in  any
    event and would have nothing to explain.   Moreover,  as  I  have  also
    pointed out, the Accountant's Letter provides no  explanation  for  the
    second discrepancy.

39. The Respondent was  entitled  to  rely  on  the  two  discrepancies  as
    evidence of dishonesty absent some explanation.   As  the  guidance  in
    Khan makes clear those discrepancies are sufficient for an inference to
    be drawn.  What is required in response  is  a  plausible  explanation.
    The Accountant's Letter does not  provide  that  explanation.   If  the
    Applicant thought it did he could have referred to it, but he  did  not
    do so.  In this case, although the  Applicant  was  blaming  the  First
    Accountant for the discrepancies, that is not as is made clear in  Khan
    sufficient on its  own.  The  Applicant  has  to  provide  a  plausible
    explanation for the dishonesty.

40. I will come on to the other points relied upon  by  the  Respondent  as
    reasons for refusing the application, but before I do  so  I  note  the
    other points  made  about  the  procedure  adopted  in  this  case,  in
    particular at the interview.  Mr Gajjar said that the  questioning  was
    limited and there was no probing of the  answers  in  relation  to  the
    discrepancies.  He drew my attention to  Judge  Canavan's  decision  in
    Williams v Secretary of State JR/10532/2017, in particular at [31].   I
    do not accept that what is there said has any  bearing  on  this  case.
    The question at [35] of the interview in this case  already  implies  a
    finding that the interviewee is not credible in the  use  of  the  word
    "discrepancy".  Once the Applicant had stated  only  that  it  was  the
    First Accountant who was at fault but that  accountant  had  failed  to
    provide an explanation, it is difficult to  see  what  further  probing
    could or should have followed, apart from reference to the Accountant's
    Letter on which the Applicant did not rely and which for reasons I have
    already given does not provide any answer to  the  discrepancy  in  any
    event.

41. That is also the reason for rejecting Mr Gajjar's submission  that  the
    decision maker was not entitled to rely on the discrepancy because  the
    interviewer had found the Applicant to be  not  credible  but  only  by
    reference to question [16].  The line of questioning in relation to the
    discrepancy already raises issues about  the  Applicant's  credibility,
    and as Mr Malik put it, it is then for the decision maker  to  consider
    the explanation in the context of the other materials.

42. In light of the difficulties with the Accountant's Letter (to  which  I
    have already referred), the  failure  to  mention  this  in  the  First
    Decision does not render that decision unlawful.  The most which can be
    gleaned from the Accountant's Letter itself by way of  explanation  for
    the discrepancies is as set  out  in  the  Second  Decision,  that  the
    Applicant stated that he was not satisfied with  the  services  of  the
    First Accountant.  The suggestion in the Accountant's Letter  that  the
    Home Office had wrongly equated the  Applicant's  position  as  company
    director with that of a self-employed person is not  explained  in  the
    Accountant's Letter nor is it explained how that makes  any  difference
    to the figures relied upon in terms of the Applicant's  own  income  or
    how the discrepant figures are to be reconciled.  It does not deal with
    the second discrepancy at all.

43. In terms of the complaint about the First Accountant's  services,  that
    is simply an assertion by the  second  accountant  based  on  what  the
    Applicant told them.  There is nothing from the Applicant himself,  nor
    any  acknowledgement  from   the   First   Accountant   accepting   any
    responsibility.  The Applicant has since  complained  about  the  First
    Accountant's conduct but that  complaint  postdates  the  decision  and
    there is nothing to suggest that the First Accountant has accepted  any
    responsibility.

44. Insofar as Mr Gajjar relies on the Respondent having in his  possession
    other documents to which he ought to have had  regard,  the  Respondent
    was obviously satisfied with what those documents showed  at  the  time
    since  he  granted  leave  to  remain  in  response  to  those  earlier
    applications, but that was at  a  time  when  he  was  unaware  of  the
    discrepancies.  Moreover, in spite  of  what  the  Accountant's  Letter
    suggests about  the  earnings  declared  to  HMRC  being  correct,  the
    Applicant has since amended his tax returns leading  to  a  payment  of
    over �6,000.00 tax which implies that it was those figures  which  were
    wrong.  As it is though, it is still not clear which  are  the  correct
    figures because the Accountant's Letter raises more questions  than  it
    answers.

45. For those reasons this is not a case as in Khan where the  Respondent's
    failure to engage with the content of the Accountant's Letter can  make
    any difference.  The Accountant's Letter offers no explanation for  the
    first discrepancy and says nothing about the 2012-13 discrepancy, aside
    that the firm was waiting for more information from HMRC.  There is  no
    follow-up to that letter.

46. The Respondent was entitled to rely on the discrepancies as evidence of
    dishonesty and to refuse ILR on character and conduct  grounds  in  the
    absence of any plausible explanation for  these  discrepancies.   There
    was no such explanation.

47. Mr Malik makes the additional point as made in both Decisions that  the
    Applicant has confirmed that he saw and signed his tax returns.  Whilst
    I accept that the fact that the Applicant works in private banking does
    not mean that he would necessarily understand tax matters and I  accept
    he is in fact only a co-ordinator, these were substantial discrepancies
    to which anyone with any understanding of business who is  running  his
    own company would  be  alert.   Particularly  in  the  absence  of  any
    confirmation from the First Accountant that the mistake was that of the
    accountant, the Respondent was entitled to rely on these  reasons  also
    for refusing the application.

48. For those reasons, the application for judicial review fails on grounds
    1 and 2. As I have already explained, I do not need to deal with ground
    3.

49. I add that even if I  had  concluded  that  the  error  in  the  Second
    Decision disavowing an  assertion  of  dishonesty  rendered  the  First
    Decision unlawful, I would still have refused relief.   Section  15  of
    the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 has been amended by  the
    Criminal Justice Courts Act 2015 so as to include at Section 15(5)(a) a
    requirement for the Tribunal  to  consider  whether  relief  should  be
    granted even where a judicial review is  allowed.   The  issue  whether
    relief should be granted is to be determined in the same manner  as  in
    the High Court under the Senior Courts Act 1981.  That Act now provides
    in Section 31 that the court must not grant relief if it appears to the
    court to be highly likely that the outcome for the applicant would  not
    have been substantially different if the conduct complained of had  not
    occurred.

50. In this case not only am I satisfied that the Respondent  was  entitled
    to refuse the applicant ILR in reliance on paragraph 322(5) because  of
    the Applicant's dishonesty in relation to his  discrepant  declarations
    of income, but on the evidence before the Respondent it is difficult to
    see what other conclusion  the  Respondent  could  have  reached.   The
    exercise of discretion on the part of the Respondent is not part of the
    Applicant's challenge.  For those reasons the outcome for the Applicant
    would not have been substantially different if the Respondent  had  not
    disavowed  dishonesty  in  the  Second  Decision.   It  is  my  primary
    conclusion, of course, that the Respondent alleged  dishonesty  in  the
    First Decision and that what is said in the Second  Decision  makes  no
    difference to the lawfulness of the First Decision.  For all  of  those
    reasons the judicial review is refused.

Costs

51. The costs order I shall make  is  that  the  Applicant  shall  pay  the
    Respondent's costs in the sum of �7,053.00.

Permission to Appeal

52. Mr Gajjar does  not  have  instructions  to  make  an  application  for
    permission to appeal.  I am required to consider that in any event.   I
    refuse permission.  There is no arguable error in my decision.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).
