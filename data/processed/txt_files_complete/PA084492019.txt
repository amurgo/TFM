For the Appellant:     Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Greer, Counsel instructed by Kalsi Solicitors
(Manchester)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Jamaica born in 1980.  By its  decision
    dated the 16th  December  2019  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  his
    appeal, on protection and human rights grounds, against a  decision  to
    deport him.  The Secretary  of  State  now  has  permission  to  appeal
    against that decision.

 2. The reasons that the Secretary of State wishes to deport the Respondent
    are many. He is a 'foreign criminal' as defined by s32 of  the  Borders
    Act 2007 and as such is liable  to  automatic  deportation.  The  index
    offence is the Respondent's conviction, on the  18th  August  2018,  of
    unlawful wounding contrary to s20 of the Offences  Against  the  Person
    Act 1861.  The circumstances of that offence were that he  beat  a  man
    about the head with a metal implement believed  to  be  a  tyre  wrench
    causing what the trial judge  described  as  "an  extremely  unpleasant
    wound" which caused the victim to have 14 stitches  in  his  head.   In
    addition to this  the  Respondent  has  a  criminal  history  involving
    various serious driving offences, possession of a bladed  article,  one
    other count of actual bodily harm and possession of Class A drugs.  For
    good measure the public interest also requires the Respondent's removal
    from this country because he  has  an  appalling  immigration  history,
    including the use of false instruments, illegal entry and overstaying.

 3. The Respondent did not dispute any of that, but contended that he could
    nevertheless resist automatic deportation with  reference  to  the  two
    'exceptions' set out in s33 (2) of the Borders Act 2007: protection and
    human rights. The First-tier Tribunal found in his favour in respect of
    both matters, and before me the Secretary of State  challenges  all  of
    its findings. It is convenient that I deal with each matter in turn.




    Protection

 4. The basis of the Respondent's claim for protection was  that  he  is  a
    well-known 'MC' in the Jamaican music scene who is from a family with a
    long association with gang warfare. Several members of his family  have
    been murdered as a result of this violence, and the Respondent  himself
    avers that he has twice been shot.     Relying on the country  guidance
    of AB (protection, criminal  gangs,  internal  relocation)  Jamaica  CG
    [2007]  UKAIT  00018  the  Respondent  submitted  that  there  was   no
    reasonable  likelihood  that  he  would  be  admitted  to  the  witness
    protection programme, and thus that he would not receive a  sufficiency
    of protection from the Jamaican state.

 5. The Secretary of State refused to grant protection on  the  basis  that
    the Respondent had not shown himself to face a real risk of  harm  upon
    return to Jamaica. The Secretary of State pointed to  the  Respondent's
    long record of deception, his delay in claiming  asylum  and  his  poor
    immigration history to conclude that the account was a fabrication. The
    Secretary of State further had regard to the  length  of  sentence  and
    imposed a certificate under s72 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 on the grounds that the Respondent was a 'serious criminal'.  This
    certificate had  the  effect  of  excluding  the  Respondent  from  the
    protection of the Refugee Convention and/or the relevant parts  of  the
    Qualification Directive.

 6. In respect of the s72 certificate the Judge directed himself  that  the
    presumption in the Act that the Respondent  has  been  convicted  of  a
    "particularly serious crime" is rebuttable.  The decision refers to the
    sentencing remarks of the trial judge and notes that the Respondent was
    acquitted of the most serious charges he had faced. The Judge had noted
    that there was an "element of excessive self-defence"  in  the  assault
    and for that reason had given him a sentence at the lower  end  of  the
    range available to him for this 'Category 1'  offence.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal concluded:

         "Having taken into account all facts and matters with regard to the
         nature of  the  crime,  the  part  played  by  the  appellant,  the
         mitigating factors and the eventual penalty imposed,  I  find  that
         the appellant has been convicted of a serious crime but he has  not
         been convicted of a particularly serious  crime.  Relevant  factors
         include  the  element  of  excessive  self-defence  the   lack   of
         premeditation and intention, and the sentence at the lower  end  of
         the range.

         Therefore I conclude that the appellant has rebutted the section 72
         presumption  and  thus  he  may  be  entitled  to  refugee  status,
         depending on my conclusions regarding the facts of his case".

                                                      (emphasis in original)

 7. The First-tier Tribunal then considered the  facts,  and  found  itself
    satisfied, to the lower standard of proof, that the  account  given  by
    the Respondent was true. The account of gang warfare, and in particular
    the nexus between that violent criminality and the music scene, was all
    consistent with the country background  material.  The  Respondent  had
    scars which supported his claim to have  been  shot  in  the  past  and
    newspaper articles confirming his work as an artist in both the  United
    Kingdom and Jamaica. The Tribunal heard and accepted detailed  evidence
    from two additional witnesses, the Respondent's cousin and partner, who
    both materially  corroborated  his  claim.  Having  taken  all  of  the
    evidence into account the Tribunal was satisfied  that  the  Respondent
    had an uncle who was a 'Don' (a prominent gang leader) in his home area
    in Jamaica; this man's activities had caused substantial  problems  for
    other family members and he himself had been forced  to  flee  Jamaica;
    the Respondent's uncle and a number  of  cousins  had  been  shot;  the
    Respondent himself was shot in 2013 as a result of his connection  with
    the 'Don'; the Respondent would face a real risk of serious harm today.

 8. The effect of these two findings was that the Respondent  succeeded  in
    defeating the deportation action on protection grounds.

 9. The Secretary of State has two complaints about that.




    The s72 Certificate

10. The first ground of appeal is that it was not rationally  open  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal to conclude  that  the  s72  presumption  had  been
    rebutted. In particular:

      i) The Tribunal did not direct its mind to whether the Respondent  was
         a "danger to the community",  the  relevant  test  at  s72(6).  The
         Secretary  of  State  thought  the  Respondent's  lack  of  remorse
         particularly relevant to that matter;

     ii) The conclusions of the Tribunal  were  not  supported  by  adequate
         reasoning. Before me Mr Tan elaborated on  this  ground  to  submit
         that the Tribunal had failed to have regard to the totality of  the
         sentencing  remarks,  and  had  misconstrued  them  to  include   a
         reference to a lack of pre-meditation.  Further, it  is  submitted,
         the First-tier Tribunal failed to weigh in  the  balance  the  fact
         that the index offence was only the last in a long line of criminal
         offences, each of increasing severity;

    iii) Although this point does not feature in the grounds of  appeal,  Mr
         Tan submitted that the Tribunal's conclusions are incompatible with
         the Guidelines of the  Sentencing  Council,  which  place  unlawful
         wounding under s20 OAPA 1861 in  'Category  1',  meaning  that  the
         offence caused greater harm and that the perpetrator had  a  higher
         degree of culpability.

11. Mr Greer responded that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  could
    not be described as outwith the range of reasonable responses.  It  had
    before it all of the relevant evidence and it plainly had regard to the
    nature of the  offence,  the  sentencing  remarks  and  indeed  to  the
    Sentencing Council guidelines, since the decision itself refers to  the
    offence as falling within Category 1 (see FTT �60).   Mr Greer  further
    submitted that the First-tier Tribunal clearly identified those factors
    which  led  it  to  find  the  presumption  rebutted,  and  that  taken
    cumulatively these matters  could  rationally  be  held  sufficient  to
    displace the certificate. The factors were that there was an element of
    excessive self defence in  the  assault,  that  there  was  a  lack  of
    intention/pre-meditation and that the sentence  imposed  by  the  trial
    judge was at the lower end of the range available to him.

12. I am not satisfied that ground (i) as I summarise it above is made out.
      Although the determination does not actually refer to it,  there  was
    clear evidence that the Respondent  is  remorseful  for  his  offending
    behaviour. At paragraph 44 of his witness statement he explains what he
    gained from the victim awareness course that he  undertook  in  prison,
    and how he has worked with  his  Offender  Manager  to  understand  the
    impact of the assault on the victim. He says that he had perceived  his
    child to be in danger and reacted wrongly and inappropriately  to  that
    situation.   All of those matters were pertinent  to  the  question  of
    whether the Respondent continues to present a danger to the community.

13. Nor am I satisfied that ground (iii) above is a  good  one.  The  Judge
    expressly recognises that this was a Category 1 offence and as such  he
    was, it seems, aware of the Sentencing Guidelines and  their  relevance
    here.

14. As to ground (ii) I note that before me there was some dispute  between
    Mr Tan and Mr Greer about the rationality of the Tribunal's comment [at
    its �61] that the Respondent  showed  a  "lack  of  pre-meditation  and
    intention" in the assault. Mr Tan submitted that in circumstances where
    he had beat his victim over the head with a tyre wrench this  reasoning
    was hard  to  understand.   Whilst  I  have  some  sympathy  with  that
    submission, having had regard to the sentencing remarks of Mr  Recorder
    Biddle I am satisfied that the  Tribunal  was  entitled  to  frame  its
    reasoning in this manner. As Recorder Biddle clearly sets out, there is
    no allegation that the Respondent set out that  night  to  assault  his
    victim. An  altercation  arose  between  the  victim  and  one  of  the
    Respondent's children and matters escalated very quickly. Although  the
    jury did not accept that the Respondent had  acted  entirely  in  self-
    defence - that much  was  implicit  in  the  verdict  of  guilty  -  in
    sentencing Recorder Biddle held that there  had  been  an  "element  of
    excessive self-defence" and for that reason reduced the  sentence.   It
    will also be noted that the Respondent was acquitted  of  more  serious
    charges brought under s18 OAPA 1861, for  which  the  prosecution  were
    required to show he had the mens rea  to  intentionally  cause  serious
    injury;  by  contrast  the  mens  rea  for  s20  can  be   limited   to
    recklessness, and this would appear to have been the Judge's conclusion
    here.  Accordingly I am satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    entitled to weigh those matters in the balance when considering whether
    the certificate should be discharged.

15. That leaves this point arising from ground  (ii):  did  the  First-tier
    Tribunal fail to weigh in the balance the fact that the  index  offence
    was only the last  in  a  long  line  of  criminal  offences,  each  of
    increasing severity?   Under  the  heading  'Immigration  History'  the
    Tribunal records the index offence [at its  �21];   under  the  heading
    'The Respondent's Case' reference is made to the  certificate  but  not
    the reasons for its imposition;   under  the  heading  'Exclusion  from
    Entitlement  to  Refugee  Status'  the  Tribunal  sets  out  the  legal
    framework and the facts gleaned from the sentencing  remarks  discussed
    above. Nowhere is any reference  made  to  the  12  offences  that  the
    Respondent had already been convicted of prior to 2018. These  offences
    included, in 2008, a conviction for actual bodily  harm,  and  in  2006
    possession of a bladed article.   Were these  earlier  convictions  not
    pertinent to the enquiry prompted by s72(6): is the Respondent a danger
    to the community?

16. The presumption in favour of a certificate excluding a serious criminal
    from the benefit of international protection is found in section  72(2)
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:

         (2)  A person shall be presumed to have been convicted by  a  final
         judgment of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger
         to the community of the United Kingdom if he is-

             (a)  convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and

             (b)  sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  at  least  two
             years.

17. And the provision that it may be rebutted is at s72(6):

         (6)  A presumption under subsection (2), (3) or (4) that  a  person
         constitutes a danger to the community is rebuttable by that person.

18. On the face of the statute there is a nexus between the danger posed by
    the foreign criminal and the offence for which he has been sentenced to
    a period of at least two years.  It  is  therefore  arguable  that  the
    earlier offences have no part to play in the assessment of whether  the
    Respondent currently poses a danger to the community, since the statute
    simply invites  the  decision  maker  to  determine  that  matter  with
    reference to the index offence. If that is right then Judge Cole cannot
    be said to  have  erred  in  failing  to  consider  those  convictions.
    Attractive as that argument is I am not  satisfied  that  the  criminal
    record of the proposed deportee can be said to be irrelevant.  That  is
    because in any forward looking risk  assessment  the  offence  must  be
    viewed in context. The context here is that this was not the first time
    that the Respondent had been involved in  violence;  this  was  clearly
    relevant to the assessment of whether he was likely to offend again.

19. I therefore find that the s72 deliberations in the First-tier  Tribunal
    are flawed for error of law, that being the failure  to  take  material
    evidence into account.

20. I remake the decision in respect of the certificate as follows.

21. Notwithstanding the clear legislative intent at s72(6) that it is  only
    one limb of the presumption that can  be  rebutted  -  "that  a  person
    constitutes a danger to the community" -  in  IH  (s.72;  'Particularly
    Serious Crime') Eritrea [2009] UKAIT 00012 the Upper Tribunal held that
    the constraints of international refugee and  European  law  were  such
    that the statute must be read to  mean  that  both  limbs  required  to
    impose the certificate can be rebutted. Accordingly it is open  to  the
    Respondent  to  demonstrate  that  he  had  not  been  convicted  of  a
    "particularly serious offence" and/or that he no longer  constituted  a
    danger to the community.

22. The crime itself - s20 wounding - is a Category 1 offence. The starting
    point for sentencing is, as Recorder Biddle notes,  three  and  a  half
    years imprisonment.  Parliament  legislated  to  the  effect  that  any
    sentence of two years or more would carry with it a presumption that it
    was a "particularly" serious offence. I have  taken  into  account  the
    mitigating factors  mentioned  by  Recorder  Biddle,  and  the  remorse
    expressed by the Respondent in his witness statement.  I  must  however
    place the offence in the context of the Respondent's behaviour overall.
    He has consistently shown disregard for  immigration  control;  he  has
    committed no fewer than 12 other offences,  including  another  assault
    for which he received a sentence of 6 months imprisonment. Whilst there
    may have been an "element  of  excessive  self-defence"  in  the  index
    offence, the Respondent still hit someone over the head  with  a  metal
    implement, causing that man to have 14 stitches in his head. I think it
    would be fair to draw the inference that the blow must have been struck
    with some force.  Those were the facts that led him to be sentenced  to
    30 months' imprisonment.  On those  facts  I  am  unable  to  find  the
    presumption rebutted. The Respondent  has  not  demonstrated  that  the
    assault was not a particularly serious  crime,  or  that  he  does  not
    constitute a danger to the community.




    Risk of Harm

23. The second of the Secretary of State's complaints is  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal erred in its conclusions on  the  risk  of  harm  to  the
    Respondent  if  he  were  to  be  returned  to  Jamaica.  As   Mr   Tan
    acknowledged, it was this finding by the First-tier Tribunal that is at
    the heart of this appeal,  since  it  would  prevent  the  Respondent's
    removal from the United Kingdom even if  the  certificate  were  to  be
    upheld, Article 3 ECHR being a non-derogable, absolute right.

24. The grounds of appeal submit that the Tribunal failed in its assessment
    of the claim to weigh in the balance the fact that the Respondent has a
    long history of deception and that he had delayed in claiming asylum. I
    reject that ground, since the First-tier Tribunal expressly  took  both
    matters into account. At �64 the Tribunal directs itself to  section  8
    of the Asylum (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004, and weighs against
    the Respondent the delay in claiming asylum.   In  the  same  paragraph
    the Tribunal notes that he has used multiple  identities.  At  �65  the
    Tribunal records that it has taken these matters into account, and that
    they  have  reduced  the  Respondent's  credibility.   This  ground  is
    therefore entirely misleading.

25. Mr Tan attempted to salvage the attack  on  the  findings  of  risk  by
    submitting that the reasoning of the Tribunal at its  �75  was  flawed.
    Again this was not a point taken in the grounds but I permitted Mr  Tan
    to argue it. At  its  �75  the  Tribunal  placed  some  weight  on  the
    Respondent's behaviour in 2013 when he  chose  not  to  travel  to  the
    United Kingdom on  a  passport  containing  what  purported  to  be  an
    endorsement for valid  leave  to  remain.  The  Tribunal  accepted  the
    Respondent's evidence that he  had  instead  used  a  different  travel
    document because he was worried about trying to leave Jamaica  in  that
    identity:

         "The risk and criminality was unnecessary as  the  Appellant  could
         have just re-entered the United Kingdom with the leave to remain in
         the  Clive  Byfield  passport.  I  therefore  find  that  the  only
         reasonable inference from these facts is  that  the  Appellant  was
         afraid of using the Clive Byfield passport to leave Jamaica"

26. Mr Tan complains, with some justification, that this was  not  in  fact
    the "only reasonable inference" that  could  have  been  drawn.  It  is
    possible, for instance,  that  the  Respondent  didn't  use  the  Clive
    Byfield passport because he had lost it,  or  perhaps  sold  it  on  or
    loaned it to someone else. I am not however prepared to interfere  with
    the First-tier Tribunal's risk assessment for that reason. Whilst  this
    paragraph did contribute in some way to the Tribunal's decision, it was
    not the only reason it gave for believing him to be at risk.  The  main
    evidence that went to that finding was the unchallenged evidence of the
    Respondent's cousin and partner, both  of  whom  could  attest  to  key
    elements of his testimony. His cousin confirmed the family  history  of
    violence, and the background about the 'Don'. She  personally  knew  of
    four other people in the immediate family who had been shot because  of
    connections to the Don and in at least one case had newspaper clippings
    to support her  evidence.    She  and  the  Respondent's  partner  both
    confirmed that to their knowledge the Respondent was shot  in  2013  in
    the circumstances that  he  describes.    The  partner's  evidence  was
    similarly unchallenged. In those circumstances the comments made by the
    Tribunal  at  its  �75  added  little  to  the   overall   conclusions,
    particularly in respect of the 2013 attack.

27. Accordingly I find that the First-tier Tribunal decision on risk stands
    and that the Respondent succeeds in demonstrating that he faces a  real
    risk of serious harm should he be deported to Jamaica. Although I  have
    upheld the certificate the Respondent succeeds on Article 3 grounds.




    Human Rights

28. The second limb of the Secretary of State's challenge is in respect  of
    the Tribunal's findings that  the  impact  on  at  least  some  of  the
    Respondent's 14 children would be  unduly  harsh.    The  Secretary  of
    State relies on dicta from the Court of Appeal in a  number  of  cases,
    such as Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  v  PG  (Jamaica)
    [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1213,  to  submit  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    reasoning "does not support a findings of the high threshold  of  undue
    harshness, as set out in the case law".

29. The higher courts have repeatedly emphasised that although  the  'undue
    harshness' test falls somewhere in the middle of the statutory spectrum
    - framed on one side by 'reasonableness' and on  the  other  by   'very
    compelling circumstances' - this should not obscure the fact  that  the
    test sets a high threshold.  The 'commonplace' distress  that  will  be
    caused to children if a parent is removed is not sufficient:  otherwise
    any parent facing deportation would be able to succeed.  Dicta to  this
    effect can be found not only in PG (Jamaica)  but  in  BL  (Jamaica)  v
    Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  357,
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  AJ  (Zimbabwe)  and  VH
    (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 1012 and NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662.  It was further underlined
    in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2018]
    UKSC 53 where [at �27] the Supreme Court  endorsed  the  dicta  of  the
    Upper Tribunal in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) as  to  what  kind  of  suffering  the
    statute is here concerned with:

         "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh'  does
         not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or  merely
         difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold.
         'Harsh' in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It  is
         the  antithesis  of  pleasant  or  comfortable.  Furthermore,   the
         addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated standard
         still higher."

30. The First-tier Tribunal's findings are set  out  from  its  �101.   The
    Respondent has 14 children, all of whom are "qualifying"  according  to
    s117D Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  He  also  has  two
    stepchildren with  whom  he  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship.  The majority of these children being  British,  it  does
    not appear to have been advanced that they could reasonably be expected
    to relocate to Jamaica with the Respondent. The key  issue,  identified
    the First-tier Tribunal, was whether it was unduly harsh to expect  any
    of them to remain in the United Kingdom without  their  father.   Three
    children became the  focus  for  the  Tribunal,  all  older  boys.  The
    evidence indicated that in each of these cases, the  behaviour  of  the
    boys  had  been  extremely  challenging  during  the  period  that  the
    Respondent was absent from their lives (ie when he was  in  prison  and
    immigration detention). In the case of Child A the Tribunal heard  from
    his mother, who explained that his  behaviour  had  worsened  when  his
    father went away, and how the Respondent was able to get that behaviour
    back under control after he was released. Child  A's  mother  expressed
    concerns  that  he  would  "slip  back  into  poor  behaviour"  if  the
    Respondent were to be deported. The  Tribunal  found  that  it  had  no
    reason to doubt this evidence. In the case of Child  B  his  mother  (a
    different woman) gave evidence to similar  effect  and  said  that  her
    son's behaviour had "massively improved" since  his  father  came  back
    into daily contact with him.  The same could be said  for  her  younger
    son, Child C.  This witness has six  children  to  cope  with  and  the
    Tribunal noted that the challenging behaviour of these two children, in
    particular Child B, made in particularly difficult for her  to  manage.
      Her  evidence  was  supported  by  a  letter  from  an  'Early   Help
    Practitioner'.   The Tribunal found this evidence  to  be  "compelling"
    and found it to elevate the distress felt  by  these  children  to  the
    level of undue harshness.  It  described  the  circumstances  faced  by
    these mothers in dealing with their  sons  as  "specific,  unusual  and
    exceptional" factors which meant that the appeal fell to be allowed.

31. The Secretary of State points to the  guidance  in  PG  (Jamaica),  and
    submits that this reasoning was inadequate.

32. I am not satisfied that this ground is made out. This was not simply  a
    family facing commonplace  distress.   The  Tribunal  identified  three
    children for whom the impact of the Respondent's decision would be, for
    specific reasons, unduly harsh.   Those  reasons  turned  on  the  very
    challenging behaviour of these children, and the Respondent's key  role
    in improving it.

33. It is true that the reasoning in the decision is  brief.  The  Tribunal
    could no doubt have spent a little more time setting out the  evidence.
    In respect of Child B, for instance, the letter from the  'Early  Years
    Practitioner' explained that he has been placed in  a  'referral  unit'
    and that he is subject to an Education and Health  Care  Plan,  with  a
    focus on his difficulty in speaking. His mother was struggling  to  get
    him up and off to school and she was  met  with  intransigence  and  on
    occasion violence in her attempts to ensure  he  attended:  the  bundle
    contained photographs of injuries to her said to have  been  caused  by
    this child.  Other photos show the damage he caused to the family  home
    during a tantrum.   In addition to refusing to attend  school  Child  B
    also repeatedly ran away from home, resulting in police involvement  on
    multiple occasions.  The Early Years Practitioner goes on to  say  that
    since the Respondent's return to the family home, Child  B's  behaviour
    has improved to the extent that he now has a 92.59% attendance rate  at
    school and there has only been one recorded instance  of  "unmanageable
    behaviour".   Having  visited  the  family  at  home  the  Practitioner
    recorded that the children, including Child B, are "relaxed and  happy"
    around the Respondent, who responds to their needs appropriately.  This
    was the evidence which led the Tribunal to its conclusions  that  there
    were specific circumstances relating to Child B which merited a finding
    of undue harshness. It would no doubt have assisted  the  Secretary  of
    State in understanding the decision if this evidence had been  set  out
    in more detail, but I am satisfied that the reasoning, scant as it  is,
    was adequate.

34. I should add for the sake of completeness that in respect  of  Child  B
    the evidence also  included  his  'Education  Health  and  Care  Plan',
    details of the 'Team Around the Family'  discussions,  a  Psychological
    Assessment Report  and a reference from his school, all consonant  with
    the letter from the Early Years Practitioner I have  summarised  above.
    In respect  of  Child  C  the  bundle  contained  a  letter  from  'One
    Education' Emotional Trauma Support service setting out the behavioural
    challenges that he faces, and the level of intensive therapy that he is
    being  offered.     All  of  this  evidence  supports  the   First-tier
    Tribunal's conclusions that these were not 'ordinary' children.

35. I therefore dismiss ground (iii).




    Anonymity Order

36. The Appellant is a foreign criminal and as such he would not ordinarily
    have the benefit of an order for anonymity. This  decision  is  however
    concerned with a number of children. I am concerned that identification
    of the Respondent could lead to identification of  those  children.  As
    such I am  satisfied,   having  had  regard  to  the  guidance  in  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders,  that  it
    would be appropriate to make an order in accordance with Rule 14 of the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him, any of his witnesses  or
         any member of his  family.   This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
         others, both the Appellant and the Respondent.  Failure  to  comply
         with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

37. Ground (i) is made out. The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    uphold the certificate imposed under s72 Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 is set aside. I remake that part  of  the  decision  by
    upholding the Secretary of State's decision to certify.

38. The remaining grounds are dismissed and the decisions of the First-tier
    Tribunal to allow the appeal on human rights and protection grounds are
    upheld.

39. There is an order for anonymity.
