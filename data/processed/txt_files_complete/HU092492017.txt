Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms R Popal (counsel instructed on a public access
basis)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood (Home Office Specialist Appeals Team)



                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Melody [M], a citizen of Zimbabwe born 9  March
       2000, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  of  13  August
       2018 dismissing her appeal against the refusal of entry clearance  of
       4 August 2017.


    2. Her application of 2 May 2017 was to join  the  Sponsor,  her  father
       [BM],  as  his  dependent  child  on  the  basis  that  he  had  sole
       responsibility for her.

    3. The application was refused because the Entry Clearance  Officer  did
       not accept sole responsibility was established: there was no evidence
       of the Appellant  spending  time  with  the  Sponsor  after  he  left
       Zimbabwe in 2002 or his having maintained her  financially,  and  the
       mother had remained her legal guardian.

    4. The background to the application was that  the  Sponsor  had  had  a
       brief relationship  with  the  Appellant's  mother  in  2000,  before
       leaving Zimbabwe for  the  UK  in  2002,  where  he  claimed  asylum,
       ultimately obtaining indefinite leave to remain on  28  January  2016
       following a discretionary grant of leave,  his  asylum  claim  having
       been rejected. The Appellant had last seen him when she was two years
       old.  She had lived with her mother until around two years ago,  when
       her relationship with her mother and her new partner, her stepfather,
       fractured, as the latter refused to incorporate  her  in  the  family
       unit.   The Sponsor turned to a former  schoolfriend,  [EC],  who  he
       contacted via Facebook, to take her in;  thereafter  she  lived  with
       [EC].

    5. On the appeal, the Appellant maintained the  Sponsor  did  have  sole
       responsibility for her and alternatively that there were serious  and
       compelling family and other considerations  rendering  her  exclusion
       undesirable. Further evidence was  provided  by  way  of  two  expert
       reports.

    6. A report from a Psychologist, Tichaona Makamure,  practising  at  the
       Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, stated that the Appellant  had  been
       under his care since 31 July 2017 since the Appellant's mother became
       unwilling to care for her any longer,  because  of  the  stepfather's
       stance. She had dropped out of school having obtained poor grades due
       to a lack of home support, including a lack of financial support. She
       had since been forced to rely on maternal  relatives  who  could  not
       offer the basic care require and her father in the UK offered her the
       only hope of a more stable and willing family setting.

    7. She had surfaced with psychotherapy needs  via  the  victim  friendly
       unit at a crisis centre which had been contacted by the  Sponsor.  An
       initial examination indicated impaired memory and attention,  intense
       feelings of abandonment, poor interaction with other people including
       adults and peers, failing to adapt to group  values  and  norms,  low
       self-esteem and a  lack  of  ability  to  trust  others.  A  detailed
       subsequent examination found poor self-care failing to attend to  her
       basic needs, and a number of sessions led to a diagnosis of  problems
       with various psychosocial  issues  including  child  physical  abuse,
       maltreatment  and  abuse,  insomnia,  and   borderline   intellectual
       functioning, all of which had been affected by  the  quality  of  her
       parental relationships.


    8. A clinical social worker, Tapfuma Mashoko, produced a  report  of  20
       May 2018, stating she was duly registered with  the  government,  and
       that the Appellant had been under her care since  3  September  2017.
       The mother told social services that she could not take care  of  the
       daughter as she had no income in her own right and was  unwilling  to
       jeopardise her  current  marriage.  Social  services  had  sought  to
       contact the stepfather with a view to resolving the question  of  her
       guardianship, but he had refused to engage with them. The Appellant's
       mother had been very quick to suggest giving  total  custody  of  the
       child to the father, and was directed to seek legal advice. This left
       social services concerned that the social pressures were too great to
       ensure  any  future  relationship  with  the   mother.   Ms   Mashoko
       recommended that the Appellant be reintegrated  with  her  father  if
       possible, and continued to  receive  sessions  for  self  management,
       grooming and etiquette, and that her circumstances should be  closely
       monitored by social services, subject to their resource constraints.

  Findings of the First-tier Tribunal


    9. The First-tier Tribunal directed itself consistently  with  TD  Yemen
       that sole responsibility was a factual matter that looked at  whether
       one parent had  continuing  control  and  direction  over  a  child's
       upbringing.

   10. The Judge noted that reports were provided from a social  worker  and
       psychologist showing the Appellant's state of mind.  She  had  needed
       the Sponsor's emotional support.  The  psychologist  stated  she  had
       suffered physical abuse  and  maltreatment.  The  Judge  went  on  to
       observe that the Sponsor had not travelled to  Zimbabwe  to  see  the
       Appellant,  notwithstanding  her  fragile  mental  health.   He   had
       maintained that he could not travel to Zimbabwe because of  his  fear
       of the authorities there; but his asylum claim's rejection  indicated
       a lack of any well-founded fear of the authorities there. Nor had  he
       invited her to the UK to see him as a visitor, or tried to see her in
       a third country.

   11. The Judge observed that the mother's new relationship had  apparently
       subsisted for some years, given that there was a reference to  "other
       children of the union"; the mother  appeared  to  have  continued  to
       engage with her daughter, and there was no explanation of any  sudden
       change of behaviour here;  the  proposition  that  the  mother  would
       suddenly  abdicate  responsibility,  having  brought  her   up,   was
       mystifying, the more so given there was  no  lack  of  money  as  the
       Sponsor said he was providing for the daughter. The Sponsor  referred
       to having no other relatives in Zimbabwe to care  for  his  daughter,
       though this was inconsistent with the mother's  letter  stating  that
       the  Appellant  went  to  live   with   relatives,   and   with   the
       psychologist's report saying she went with maternal relatives.

   12. There was a lack of evidence from the  mother,  notwithstanding  that
       she had cooperated with the production of the  social  worker  report
       and apparently remained on speaking terms with the  Appellant.  There
       was a lack of evidence of financial support from the Sponsor, who had
       vaguely referred to the Sponsor's wife's bank statement  to  buttress
       his claim to send money; furthermore he did not know the  details  of
       the mental health treatment his daughter received.

   13. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that  the  Appellant  continued  to
       live with her mother or had some other satisfactory arrangements  for
       her  care;  it  was  not  shown  that  the   mother   had   abdicated
       responsibility for her or  that  the  stepfather  was  a  controlling
       malign influence.

   14. The reports from the psychologist and  social  worker  portrayed  the
       Appellant whilst she was at her worst, and the Sponsor  had  admitted
       she had not received treatment for some two years.  The  evidence  of
       conversations on social media did not suggest a person with emotional
       or mental health problems. The Appellant clearly had a roof over head
       and was well provided for; she was  in  education,  and  the  Sponsor
       maintained he sent her money to care for her. There were  no  serious
       and  compelling  family  and  other  considerations   rendering   her
       exclusion undesirable.

   15. The best interests of the child were relevant to the assessment under
       the Human Rights Convention, bearing in mind that there  was  clearly
       family life between Appellant and  Sponsor.  Relevant  considerations
       were continuity of residence, the trauma of breaking up a family  and
       the disruption caused in changing  the  status  quo.  It  was  to  be
       assumed that the Appellant had established cultural  and  educational
       links and had many friends in Zimbabwe. She would be used  to  living
       apart from the Sponsor. It was not in her best  interests  to  uproot
       her from that background. She must have stronger ties to  her  mother
       than to her father, given the length they had lived apart.  Thus  the
       appeal fell to be dismissed.

  Onwards appeal


   16. Grounds of appeal contended that

        a) Relevant considerations had been overlooked, such as the cost of
           visits or travel, the fact that the Sponsor maintained a
           subjective fear of travel to Zimbabwe notwithstanding the
           rejection of his asylum claim, the cultural right of the
           stepfather to refuse to accommodate the daughter particularly in
           circumstances where she had been born out of wedlock which would
           risk social shame for the mother, and the fact that the daughter
           had not managed to sit her GCSEs because of the difficulties she
           suffered.


        b) Evidence from the expert reports had been overlooked.

   17. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission  to  appeal,  without  any
       limitation on the  grounds,  placing  particular  importance  on  the
       arguability of the grounds that  the  expert  reports  had  not  been
       adequately engaged with,  and  that  plausibility  factors  had  been
       relied on without regard to the prevailing country conditions.


   18. Ms Popal submitted that cultural factors  had  not  been  considered,
       contrary to the enjoinders to assess evidence in the context  of  the
       culture in which it arose without applying presumptions based on life
       in the UK. Furthermore, the expert evidence had not  been  adequately
       engaged with, and the First-tier Tribunal appeared to have  evaluated
       the Appellant's mental health by reference to its own  assessment  of
       the likely presentation of a person with mental  health  problems  on
       social media. There was no bright line at which  a  child  should  be
       treated as if an adult if they remained vulnerable.

   19. Ms Isherwood submitted that there was no material error of law in the
       decision, and that the Judge had referred to  all  relevant  evidence
       before him, making findings to which he was entitled to come.

Findings and reasons

   20. The authorities recognise that reasons must be  given  for  both  the
       determination of the appeal and the material findings  of  fact  upon
       which that decision is based and they must be provided in  sufficient
       detail to "enable the reader to know  what  conclusion  the  decision
       maker has reached on the principal controversial issues":   see  Lord
       Bridge in Save Britain's Heritage v No 1 Poultry  Ltd  [1991]  1  WLR
       153. As noted by Beatson LJ in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ  558  �35,
       37:


           "What is required is  that  the  reasons  must  give  sufficient
           detail to  show  the  parties  and  the  appellate  tribunal  or
           reviewing court the principles upon which the lower tribunal has
           acted, and the reasons that led it to its decision, so that they
           are able to understand why it reached its decision. The  reasons
           need not be elaborate, and need not  deal  with  every  argument
           presented ... judicial restraint should be  exercised  when  the
           reasons that  a  tribunal  gives  for  its  decision  are  being
           examined and it should not  be  assumed  too  readily  that  the
           tribunal misdirected  itself  because  not  every  step  in  its
           reasoning is set out in it".


   21. Where professional medical  expert  opinion  is  available,  then  as
       stated by the Court of Appeal in Miao [2006] EWCA Civ 75 �17:


           "A medical expert witness's function is  precisely  to  give  an
           opinion on the basis of his clinical knowledge  of  the  patient
           and of his field...and in the absence of some  good  reason  for
           doubting his expertise or the factual or logical  foundation  of
           his opinion, the immigration judge was wrong to  dismiss  it  as
           merely an opinion, much less  to  treat  it  as  speculative  or
           conjectural."


   22. Here of course there was evidence from social  services  as  well  as
       from a medical expert who had treated the Appellant at  some  length.
       It seems to me that the range and depth of the material from the  two
       expert sources required greater treatment than it received here.


   23. Whilst the duty to give reasons is  finite,  nevertheless,  the  more
       extensive the case put, then the greater the duty on the Tribunal  to
       engage with it. Here there was a range  of  detailed  expert  opinion
       from two ostensibly creditable sources whose expertise the  Secretary
       of State did not apparently put in issue, both  of  whom  had  had  a
       sustained  engagement  with  the  Appellant.  The  psychologist  gave
       extensive details of  the  Appellant's  presentation  with  a  mental
       health profile consistent with a real lack of  direct  parental  care
       over an extended period.


   24. Both report authors appeared to have  professional  exposure  to  the
       Appellant for a significant period, inconsistent with being dismissed
       on the basis of providing a "snapshot" alone. In fact, when one bears
       in mind that the psychologist produced a report in 2018 based on care
       since July 2017, and social services produced a report  of  May  2017
       based on circumstances since September 2017, it seems to me that more
       reasoning was required before this material could  be  discounted  as
       simply a "snapshot". Whilst the Tribunal discounted their opinions as
       a reliable assessment of present circumstances, it seems to  me  this
       was the wrong approach, not  least  because  an  Appellant's  age  is
       effectively frozen at the application date in entry clearance  cases;
       and if that is the public policy position struck by the  Rules,  then
       it must also be  taken  into  account  in  appeals  on  human  rights
       grounds, given the weight to be afforded to the  public  interest  as
       expressed in the Rules.

   25. In any event, the reports could  not  be  discounted  by  generalised
       presumptions as to  how  individuals  might  act  in  any  particular
       country of origin, particularly where there was express  evidence  of
       social services having ruled  out  any  serious  possibility  of  the
       mother's ongoing  involvement  in  the  Appellant's  care  given  her
       partner's  rejection  of  the  daughter.  It  is  telling  that   the
       psychologist records that it was the Sponsor, rather than the mother,
       who took action to bring  her  to  the  attention  of  mental  health
       professionals, which is a relevant factor in assessing  who  has  had
       dominant responsibility for her welfare in recent times.


   26. I accordingly find that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       cannot stand. Given that all the issues in  the  appeal  require  re-
       determination, the matter must be remitted for re-hearing afresh.

          Decision:

    The appeal must accordingly be re-heard in the First-tier Tribunal.
