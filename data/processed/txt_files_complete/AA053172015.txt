Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case involves protection issues. The appellant is  an  unaccompanied  minor.
For this reason I find that it is appropriate to continue the order.  Unless
and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellant  is  granted
anonymity. No report of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family. This  direction  applies  both  to
the appellant and to the respondent. Failure to comply with  this  direction
could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The appellant is a 16 year old boy from Albania.  He  entered  the  UK
    clandestinely with the assistance of an agent and claimed asylum on  08
    August 2014. The basis of his claim for asylum was  that  he  had  been
    exploited and trafficked by a criminal gang and feared that he would be
    at risk of further serious harm if returned to Albania.

2.    The respondent refused the asylum application in a decision  dated  12
    February 2015 but granted him Discretionary Leave to  Remain  until  12
    August 2017 as an unaccompanied  minor.  The  policy  on  unaccompanied
    asylum seeking children has now been incorporated into the  immigration
    rules at paragraph 352ZC:

         "352ZC   The requirements to be met in order for a grant of limited
                  leave to remain to be made in relation to an unaccompanied
                  asylum seeking child under paragraph 352ZE are:

                  a)   the applicant  is  an  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking
                      child under the age of  17  ï¿½  years  throughout  the
                      duration of leave to be granted in this capacity;

                  b)   the applicant must have applied for asylum  and  been
                      granted  neither  refugee  status  nor   Humanitarian
                      Protection;

                  c)   there are no adequate reception arrangements  in  the
                      country to which they would be returned if  leave  to
                      remain was not granted;

                  d)   the applicant must  not  be  excluded  from  being  a
                      refugee under Regulation 7 of the Refugee  or  Person
                      in Need of International  Protection  (Qualification)
                      Regulations  2006  or  excluded  from  a   grant   of
                      Humanitarian Protection under paragraph 339D or both;



                  e)   there are no reasonable  grounds  for  regarding  the
                      applicant as a danger to the security of  the  United
                      Kingdom;

                  f)   the applicant has  not  been  convicted  by  a  final
                      judgment of a particularly  serious  crime,  and  the
                      applicant  does  not  constitute  a  danger  to   the
                      community of the United Kingdom; and

                  g)    the  applicant  is  not,  at  the  date   of   their
                      application, the subject of a deportation order or  a
                      decision to make a deportation order."

3.    The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under section 83  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  ("NIAA  2002")  (an
    'upgrade appeal'). First-tier Tribunal Judge S.  Taylor  ("the  judge")
    dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 25 September 2015.

4.    The judge heard evidence from the  appellant  and  accepted  that  his
    account was credible. The judge accepted that the appellant was  forced
    to work for a criminal gang in Albania and was then trafficked to Italy
    [16]. The judge's assessment of risk on  return  is  contained  in  one
    paragraph of the decision [17]:

         "To successfully claim that he  would  be  at  risk  on  return  to
         Albania, the appellant would have to demonstrate that there was  no
         effective protection of victims of trafficking available,  or  that
         in his particular circumstances he would be unable to avail himself
         of the facilities which were provided. The case of AM and BM refers
         to trafficked women for sexual purposes, which does  not  apply  to
         the appellant. The country information  guidance,  which  was  made
         available to  the  Tribunal  concludes  that  [the]  government  in
         Albania had made significant strides in  dealing  with  victims  of
         trafficking and now provided effective protection  for  victims  on
         return. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there were
         inadequate shelter facilities available in Albania, but I find that
         that is not supported  by  the  submitted  background  information.
         Paragraph 2.6.12 of the submitted guidance refers to three shelters
         set up by NGOs  which  provide  comprehensive  services,  including
         medical care and re-integration services to victims of trafficking.
         Although there were no specific shelters for children, male victims
         of trafficking were provided with accommodation  in  apartments.  I
         find no independent evidence from the documents  available  to  the
         tribunal to  support  the  submission  that  there  was  inadequate
         protection available for  returning  victims  of  trafficking.  The
         refusal letter also quotes country  guidance  of  wider  assistance
         available from the government and NGOs. On the evidence before this
         Tribunal and available protection, I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
         appellant has a well founded fear of a gang on return to Albania."

5.    The appellant seeks to challenge the First-tier Tribunal  decision  on
    the following grounds:

    (i)    The First-tier Tribunal made  inadequate  findings  relating  to
         risk on return in the context of the  individual  circumstances  of
         this case.

    (ii)   The First-tier Tribunal made inconsistent findings  in  relation
         to the availability of shelters. The judge noted that there were no
         specialist shelters for children, but in light of that comment, did
         not go on to provide an adequate explanation  for  concluding  that
         sufficient protection would be available.

Decision and reasons

Error of law

6.    After having considered the grounds of appeal  and  oral  arguments  I
    satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making  of
    an error on a point of law.

7.    The judge accepted the appellant's account of past events but made  no
    clear findings as to whether the exploitation and trafficking  that  he
    accepted the appellant had suffered  in  the  past  was  sufficient  to
    amount to persecution within the meaning of the Refugee Convention.

8.    In assessing whether the appellant would be at risk on  return  it  is
    trite law that the fact that a  person  has  already  been  subject  to
    persecution or serious harm will be regarded as a serious indication of
    the person's well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering
    serious harm, unless there are  good  reasons  to  consider  that  such
    persecution or serious harm will not be repeated (paragraph 339K of the
    immigration rules).

9.    The judge failed  to  carry  out  this  assessment  in  light  of  the
    particular factual  circumstances  of  this  case.  In  this  case  the
    appellant's own father turned him over to exploitation  by  a  criminal
    gang who ran a local casino, in return for debts that he  had  run  up.
    The particular circumstances of the appellant's escape from the gang in
    Italy indicate that he may be of continued interest to them because  he
    dumped a package of drugs that he was told to sell before running away.
    The appellant's home area is Tirana. The judge made no  clear  findings
    as to whether he would continue to be at risk from further exploitation
    if returned to his father or from the criminal gang in his  home  area.
    The sole emphasis on whether a place might be available  in  a  shelter
    for victims of trafficking didn't deal adequately  with  the  issue  of
    risk on return given that Tirana would  not  be  a  place  of  internal
    relocation for this particular appellant.

10.   I find that there is also force to the appellant's argument  that  the
    judge's findings are unclear as to whether effective  protection  would
    be available on return. The judge clearly noted  that  there  were  "no
    specific shelters for  children"  [17]  yet  his  conclusion  that  the
    appellant  had  failed  to  show  that  the  shelters  or   "protection
    facilities" (undefined) were not suitable for him seems  to  contradict
    his own earlier observation [19]. An asylum claim must be given anxious
    scrutiny, and the claim of an unaccompanied  child,  must  be  assessed
    with the utmost care. The issue was not simply  whether  some  form  of
    accommodation might be available but  whether,  given  the  appellant's
    young age,  adequate  child  protection  services  were  likely  to  be
    available to  the  appellant  in  Albania.  The  evidence  relating  to
    shelters for victims of trafficking outlined by the Tribunal in AM & BM
    (Trafficked Women) Albania [2010] UKUT 080 concentrated  on  facilities
    that were available for adult women who were victims of trafficking.  I
    conclude that the judge's findings on this issue are  somewhat  unclear
    and contradictory and amount to an error of law.

11.   The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on  a
    point of law and I set aside the decision.

Re-making

12.   I go on to remake the  decision  on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's  factual  findings  relating   to   the   appellant's   past
    experiences are preserved. Given the appellant's young age at the time,
    and the serious nature of the  exploitation,  which  included  physical
    violence,  I  find  that  he  suffered  past  ill-treatment  that   was
    sufficiently serious to amount to persecution. It is quite clearly  the
    case that he would not be safeguarded if returned to the  care  of  his
    father, who was complicit in his exploitation. The criminal  gang  that
    he fears is based in his home area of Tirana. Given the rural nature of
    Albania, and the importance of kinship ties in such areas, it would not
    be reasonable to expect him to relocate to another  area.  The  central
    question is whether the authorities would be able to provide  him  with
    effective protection.

13.   There is no evidence before me to  suggest  that  the  respondent  has
    carried out her duty to endeavour to trace family members  in  Albania:
    see EU (Afghanistan) & Ors v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 32. For  the  reasons
    given above it would not be in the child's best interest to be returned
    to his father. In order to grant the appellant Discretionary  Leave  to
    Remain as an unaccompanied asylum  seeking  child  the  respondent  was
    satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of paragraph 352ZE(c)
    i.e. that there were no adequate reception arrangement in  the  country
    to which he would be returned.

14.   The US State Department Trafficking in Persons report for  2014  cited
    at  paragraph  2.6.12  of  the  respondent's  Country  Information  and
    Guidance (Albania: trafficking) dated 09 July 2015  [pg.36  AB]  states
    that male victims of trafficking were provided  with  accommodation  in
    apartments but there were no specialised shelters for child victims  of
    trafficking. While the background  evidence  deals  with  provision  of
    services for women with children  there  is  nothing  to  explain  what
    provisions would be available for  unaccompanied  children,  who  would
    need a higher level of care from social services. The Tribunal in AM  &
    BM  didn't  consider  the  specific  circumstances  for   unaccompanied
    trafficked  children.  The  background  evidence  before  me  does  not
    disclose any specific services that  are  likely  to  be  in  place  to
    safeguard unaccompanied children such as the appellant.

15.   In the  absence  of  evidence  to  show  that  he  would  be  afforded
    effective protection, and would be safeguarded, the appellant is likely
    to be vulnerable to further exploitation of a similar nature. As such I
    conclude that there is no good reason to  consider  that  such  serious
    harm would not be repeated.

16.   For these reasons I am satisfied that there is at least  a  reasonable
    degree of likelihood that the appellant would be  at  risk  of  serious
    harm amounting to persecution as  a  result  of  his  membership  of  a
    particular social group (child victim of trafficking).
