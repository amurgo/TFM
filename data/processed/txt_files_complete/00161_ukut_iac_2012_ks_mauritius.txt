For the Appellant:     Mr S. Subbarayan
For the Respondent:  Mr N. Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


In visit visa cases:

 i) There is no restriction on the number of visits a person  may  make  to
    the UK, nor any requirement that a specified time must  elapse  between
    successive visits.
ii) The periods of time spent in the United  Kingdom  and  the  country  of
    residence will always be important.
iii) Both the expressed purpose of the visit  and  what  the  appellant  has
    done in the past and intends to do in the future is material,  together
    with the length of time that has elapsed  since  previous  visits.   In
    cases of this type, the appellant will be visiting a relative, often  a
    parent visiting a son or daughter, often a son or daughter  visiting  a
    parent.  In the case of a parent visiting a son or daughter, the parent
    will often fully participate in helping in the house,  providing  child
    care.  In the case of a son or daughter visiting a  parent,  the  adult
    child will often assist in care arrangements. None of these activities,
    for that reason alone, will take the individual outside the  definition
    of a genuine visitor.
iv) The links that the appellant retains with her country of residence will
    be a material consideration.  The presence of other family members will
    be a material consideration.
 v) The Tribunal is required to  ascertain  what  is  the  reality  of  the
    arrangement entered into between the appellant  and  the  host  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Is the reality that the appellant is resident  in  the
    United Kingdom and intends to be for the foreseeable future?
vi) The issue may be approached by considering whether the reality is  that
    the appellant is now no more than a visitor to her country of residence
    as the purpose of the return home is  confined  to  using  his  or  her
    presence there solely as the  means  of  gaining  re-admission  to  the
    United Kingdom.
vii) This does not preclude the appellant from remaining in the  country  of
    residence for the least amount  of  time  sufficient  to  maintain  her
    status as a genuine visitor.
viii) Family emergencies, whilst likely to result in  a  longer  visit  than
    the established pattern, should not be regarded as taking up  residence
    without  adequate  supporting  evidence  to  that  effect.   Thus,  the
    pregnancy of a daughter or daughter-in-law  or  the  aftermath  of  the
    birth might explain a more-protracted stay (within the 6-month duration
    of a single permitted visit); so, too, a serious medical condition.
ix) There may be  comparisons  with  the  person  who  owns  homes  in  two
    different countries.  Is he resident in both or a  visitor  to  one  of
    them?

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Mauritius who was  born  on  13  February
    1945. She is now 67 years old and was already over 65 when, on  26  May
    2011, the Entry Clearance Officer in Port Louis refused to grant  entry
    clearance to her as a family visitor intending to visit her daughter.

 2. The refusal of entry clearance was expressed in the following terms:

         "I note that you have previously travelled to  the  UK  many  times
         since 2005. I note that your passport shows that you entered the UK
         on 28 May 2010 and were granted leave to remain for six  months.  I
         note that you returned back to Mauritius  on  12  August  2010  and
         stayed here almost 2 months. Your passport shows that you  returned
         to the UK on 9 October 2010 and that the immigration  officer  gave
         you a recorded landing and granted you  leave  to  remain  for  six
         months. I note that you arrived back in Mauritius on 31 March 2011.
         You have been back here for almost 2 months and  have  now  applied
         for a five-year multiple entry visa clearance to  the  UK.  I  note
         that you state on your application form that you  intend  to  visit
         the UK from 11 June 2011 until 9 December 2011. From May 2010 until
         March 2011 you have spent almost 8 � out of the last 12  months  in
         the UK. With your proposed trip,  you  are  intending  to  spend  a
         further six months in the UK (which would make a total of 14 �  out
         of the last 18 months in the UK). Whilst there is no restriction on
         the number of  visits  a  person  may  make  to  the  UK,  nor  any
         requirement that a specified time must  elapse  between  successive
         visits, it is reasonable, however, for  the  ECO  to  consider  the
         stated purpose of the visit in the light of the length of time that
         has elapsed since  previous  visits.  A  visitor  should  not,  for
         example, normally spend more than six out of any 12 months  in  the
         UK.
         In view of all the above, I do not consider that your  actions  are
         within the spirit of the immigration rules for family  visitors.  I
         note that you are widowed and  that  your  two  daughters  and  six
         siblings all live in the UK. Given that you have been spending long
         periods of time in the UK over the  last  few  years,  this  raises
         doubts as to your true intentions.
         Given all of the above and considering your application as a whole,
         I am not satisfied that  you  are  genuinely  seeking  entry  as  a
         visitor for a limited period as stated by you,  not  exceeding  six
         months and that you intend to leave the UK at the end of the period
         of the visit as stated by you (as required by Paragraph 41 (i)  and
         (ii) of the Immigration Rules."

 3. The appellant is a retired civil servant with a good pension of �450  a
    month. She owns her own home. In the circumstances  to  which  we  will
    later refer, her husband died in August 2010. She  has  family  in  the
    United Kingdom as well as a son in Canada. Indeed, the  statement  that
    she has made in support of these proceedings was  made  on  11  October
    2011 whilst she was visiting him.

 4. For the purposes of these proceedings, and most helpfully, we have been
    provided with a detailed schedule of the appellant's travelling to  the
    United Kingdom.  (The list excludes the  visits  made  to  her  son  in
    Canada or her journeys to other countries.)

                 30 November 2001 37 days    London
                 16 May 2005      34 days    London
                 14 June 2005           14 days    London
                 25 May 2007      54 days    London
                 23 July 2007           49 days    London
                 19 September 2007      15 days    London
                 10 October 2007  32 days    London
                 3 October 2009   32 days    London
                 25 May 2010      75 days    London
                 9 October 2010   172 days   London

 5. It is immediately apparent that the visit made on  9  October  2010  is
    substantially the longest visit that she has  made  and  comes  shortly
    after her bereavement when, understandably, she wanted the  support  of
    her daughter following the death of her husband.

 6. For our purposes, the material provisions of paragraph 41 of the  Rules
    are as follows:

         The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to  enter  the
         United Kingdom as a general visitor are that he:
                            i) is  genuinely  seeking  entry  as  a  general
                               visitor for a limited  period  as  stated  by
                               him, not exceeding six months...; and
                           ii) intends to leave the United  Kingdom  at  the
                               end of the period of the visit as  stated  by
                               him...

 7. In Oppong (visitor - length of stay) Ghana  [2011]  UKUT  00431  (IAC),
    the Tribunal  (Upper Tribunal Judges P.R. Lane and Perkins)  summarised
    the approach it adopted in these terms:

         An application for a visit visa which, if granted, could result  in
         permission to spend more than 6 of 12 months in the United  Kingdom
         is likely to be scrutinised rigorously but it is  wrong  to  refuse
         someone entry clearance as a general visitor just because they have
         spent more than six of the  last twelve  months  in  the  United
         Kingdom. In certain circumstances a person can utilise paragraph 41
         in order to visit the United Kingdom to provide temporary care  for
         a person present here.

 8. The respondent in  Oppong  had  decided  that  the  appellant  was  not
    genuinely seeking entry as a general visitor for a  limited  period  as
    stated by her not exceeding six months and that she had not shown  that
    she intended to leave the United Kingdom at the end of  the  period  of
    the visit as stated by her. After the notice of appeal had been sent to
    the respondent, the case was reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager who
    said:


             "However, I note from our own records and from the  appellant's
             own admission that between October 2007 and October  2009,  the
             appellant spent a total of about sixteen months in the UK.   In
             light of this I consider that the appellant has  been  residing
             in the UK whilst having  been  granted  leave  to  enter  as  a
             visitor only."


 9. The Tribunal stated there was nothing about intending  to  care  for  a
    relative that is inherently incompatible with admission  as  a  general
    visitor. It continued:

        13. It may well be that a person  who  spends  little  time  in  his
            country of nationality will  find  it  hard  to  prove  that  he
            satisfies the requirements of the Rules for entry  clearance  to
            the United Kingdom as a visitor. Certainly such a person  should
            expect his application to be subject to rigorous scrutiny and  a
            person who does not have a clear  reason  for  wanting  to  make
            frequent visits may well find that his claims about the duration
            and purpose of the visit and his intention  to  return  are  not
            believed; but there is nothing about a  prolonged  stay  in  the
            United Kingdom punctuated by return  trips  to  the  country  of
            origin  followed  soon  by  a  further  application  for   entry
            clearance as a visitor which  in  itself  as  a  matter  of  law
            disqualifies an applicant from being a visitor.

10. The Tribunal considered policy  guidance  entitled  "General  visitors:
    frequency and duration of visits" suggesting that "a visitor should not
    normally spend more than six out of any 12 months in the UK unless they
    have a good reason, such as receiving private  medical  treatment".  It
    said that whilst this was useful guidance it did not state the law  and
    it would be wrong to  refuse  someone  entry  clearance  as  a  general
    visitor just because they have spent rather more than six of  the  last
    twelve months in the United Kingdom.

11. The present appeal came  before  Immigration  Judge  TRP  Hollingworth,
    whose determination, promulgated on 26 October 2011, duly dismissed the
    appeal. No evidence from the sponsor was provided. The  Judge  recorded
    that, with the death of her husband in August 2010, the  appellant  had
    few significant family members in Mauritius. Although  the  Immigration
    Judge recorded that it was conceded that  the  appellant  had  spent  a
    total of 14 � months out of the last 18 months in United Kingdom,  this
    was not factually accurate as the table in paragraph 3  above  reveals.
    The Judge went on to say:

         "It is therefore hard to escape the inference that the appellant is
         not only seeking the maximum period  of  residence  in  the  United
         Kingdom now [b]ut if the five-year revolving visa is approved,  she
         will spend six months periods whenever it suits her.  In  my  view,
         therefore, she is not an ordinary visitor."

12. The Judge's determination avoids deciding what is an  ordinary  visitor
    and whether the appellant needed to establish that she was an  ordinary
    visitor in order to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  In
    our judgement, the question is not whether she is an  ordinary  visitor
    but whether she is a visitor.


13. On the basis of  this  flawed  reasoning,  the  Judge  found  that  the
    appellant's intentions


         "...overall were probably to use such visits in  the  future  as  a
         preliminary to settlement here at some stage."


14.  Once again, this is not the  issue  that  the  Immigration  Judge  was
    required to determine. Whatever the  future  applications  may  be  or,
    indeed, whether they  will  or  will  not  succeed  (all  of  which  is
    speculative) it appears that he  accepted  that  the  appellant  was  a
    visitor albeit for a purpose that he found fell outside those permitted
    under the Rules.  We are satisfied that this reasoning is wrong in law.
     The sole issue before the Judge was whether the appellant intended  to
    visit which necessitated her also establishing that she would leave  at
    the end of the period permitted for a single visit.


15. In this context, it is important to recall the evidence that was before
    the Judge which included statements from the appellant's  son  and  her
    daughters to the effect that the appellant had  always  travelled  with
    her husband when he  was  alive  and  that  she  intended  to  continue
    visiting her daughters and her son  on  a  regular  basis.  The  family
    considered itself fortunate to be able to afford meeting each other  on
    a regular basis, notwithstanding their living in  different  countries.
    She repeated  her  claim  that  she  only  intended  to  visit  as  the
    opportunity presented itself and not to settle  either  in  the  United
    Kingdom or in Canada. As there were no direct likes  between  Mauritius
    and Canada, travelling to Canada via the United Kingdom  was  the  most
    convenient route for her, permitting her to visit relatives both in the
    United Kingdom and in Canada. She asserted,  with  some  justification,
    that she had been honest and transparent with her  intentions  to  date
    and had complied with the requirements of her visa. In paragraph  7  of
    her statement, the appellant  acknowledged  that  she  could  apply  to
    settle under the Immigration Rules but expressly disavowed an intention
    to do so. She made the reasonable claim that, as she is retired and her
    daughters are at work, it  was  more  logical  for  her  to  visit  the
    families of her children than it was for them, at much greater cost, to
    visit the appellant in Mauritius.


16. We are satisfied that there was no reason for the Judge to dismiss  the
    appellant's claims, short of making  an  adverse  credibility  finding.
    However, there was, and is, no material upon which such a finding could
    properly have been made. The death of  her  husband  was  a  reasonable
    explanation for her wishing to spend more time with  her  children.  It
    follows that the appeal must succeed.


17. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered what factors  might  be
    material in a assessing whether an applicant is genuinely seeking entry
    as a general visitor for the limited  period  as  stated  by  her,  not
    exceeding six months, and intends to leave the United  Kingdom  at  the
    end of the period  of  the  visit  as  stated  by  her.  The  following
    considerations are relevant and may be helpful:

               i) There is no restriction on the number of visits a  person
                  may make to the UK, nor any requirement that a  specified
                  time must elapse between successive visits.


              ii) The periods of time spent in the United Kingdom  and  the
                  country of residence will always be important.


             iii)  Both the expressed purpose of the  visit  and  what  the
                  appellant has   done in the past and intends to do in the
                  future is material, together with the length of time that
                  has elapsed since previous  visits.   In  cases  of  this
                  type, the appellant will be visiting a relative, often  a
                  parent visiting  a  son  or  daughter,  often  a  son  or
                  daughter visiting a parent.  In  the  case  of  a  parent
                  visiting a son or daughter, the parent will  often  fully
                  participate in helping  in  the  house,  providing  child
                  care.  In the case  of  a  son  or  daughter  visiting  a
                  parent,  the  adult  child  will  often  assist  in  care
                  arrangements. None of these activities, for  that  reason
                  alone, will take the individual outside the definition of
                  a genuine visitor.

              iv)  The links that the appellant retains with her country of
                  residence will be a material consideration.   Inevitably,
                  there is likely to be access to accommodation if only for
                  the purpose of  returning  home  in  order  to  make  the
                  application that is intended to result in a return to the
                  United Kingdom.  The presence  of  other  family  members
                  will be a material consideration.

               v)  The Tribunal  is  required  to  ascertain  what  is  the
                  reality of  the  arrangement  entered  into  between  the
                  appellant and the host in the  United  Kingdom.   Is  the
                  reality that the appellant  is  resident  in  the  United
                  Kingdom and intends to be for the foreseeable future?

              vi) The issue may be approached by  considering  whether  the
                  reality is that the appellant  is  now  no  more  than  a
                  visitor to her country of residence as the purpose of the
                  return home is confined to  using  his  or  her  presence
                  there solely as the means of gaining re-admission to  the
                  United Kingdom.

             vii)  This does not preclude the appellant from  remaining  in
                  the country of residence for the  least  amount  of  time
                  sufficient to maintain her status as a genuine visitor.

            viii) Family emergencies, whilst likely to result in  a  longer
                  visit  than  the   established  pattern  should  not   be
                  regarded  as  taking  up   residence   without   adequate
                  supporting evidence to that effect.  Thus, the  pregnancy
                  of a daughter or daughter-in-law or the aftermath of  the
                  birth might explain a more-protracted stay (within the 6-
                  month duration of a single permitted visit); so,  too,  a
                  serious medical condition.

              ix) There may be comparisons with the person who  owns  homes
                  in two different countries.  Is he resident in both or  a
                  visitor to one of them?

      DECISION

         The Immigration Judge made an error on a point of law  and  we  re-
         make the decision allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.
