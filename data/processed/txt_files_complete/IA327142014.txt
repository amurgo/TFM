For the appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Coleman promulgated 15.1.15, allowing on both
    immigration and article 8 ECHR grounds the  claimant's  appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse him leave to enter the
    United Kingdom and to curtail his leave.  The Judge heard the appeal on
    6.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Davies  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.2.15.

 3. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    claimant first came to the UK in 2009 with  leave  as  a  student.  His
    leave was subsequently extended. In an extension application  submitted
    in 2012 he submitted an English  language  test  certificate  allegedly
    taken at the London School of Technology on 7.4.12. On  that  basis  he
    was granted further leave to remain until 30.7.13. However, in May 2013
    he submitted an application for leave to remain as the spouse of Anwara
    Khatun, a British citizen, tendering the  same  English  language  test
    certificate. On that basis he was granted further leave to remain as  a
    spouse until November 2015. In July  2014  he  and  his  wife  went  to
    Bangladesh together. On their return on 16.8.14 he  was  questioned  by
    immigration officers about his 2012 English  language  certificate.  He
    eventually admitted that he had not taken the  test  but  paid  someone
    �500 to take it for him. In consequence, the Secretary of State refused
    leave to enter and cancelled his leave to remain.

 4. At the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing,  the  claimant's  representative
    admitted that the decision  to  curtail  leave  was  lawful  under  the
    Immigration Rules and the Immigration Act 1971, reliance  being  placed
    on paragraph 322(1A) of the Rules, and section 2A of Schedule 2 to  the
    Act. The hearing proceeded on the basis of  article  8  private  family
    life only.

 5. Judge Coleman found that the claimant could not meet paragraph  276ADE,
    first because he had made no such application,  and  in  any  event  he
    failed under  the  suitability  requirement  because  of  the  previous
    submission of false documents in order to fraudulently  gain  leave  to
    remain. The judge also  found  that  there  were  no  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration into Bangladesh.

 6. In relation to family life, Judge Coleman considered EX1  and  EX2  and
    the issue as to whether there were insurmountable obstacles  to  family
    life continuing in Bangladesh, notwithstanding that the claimant's wife
    is a British citizen. At �19 the judge concluded that the claimant  had
    discharged EX1 and thus allowed the appeal under paragraph FM.

 7. The judge then went on to consider article  8  outside  the  Rules,  to
    conclude at �27 and �28 that the impact of the decision to refuse leave
    to enter and to cancel leave to  remain  was  disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate  aim  of   maintaining   immigration   control,   and   thus
    additionally allowed the appeal on article 8 grounds.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Davies found it  arguable  that
    the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  findings  that  the  effect  on  the
    claimant's wife of the decision to refuse leave to enter the  UK  would
    be so devastating that it would be disproportionate  are  not  in  fact
    borne out by the evidence. Further,  it  is  arguable  that  the  judge
    failed to identify what unjustifiable hardship would be caused  by  the
    claimant's wife continuing her family life with him in Bangladesh.

 9. Thus the matter came before me on 17.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  In my error of law decision I found  that  the  decision  to
    allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules was  misconceived  and  in
    error of law. The judge  found  that  he  claimant  did  not  meet  the
    suitability requirements under Appendix FM. In those circumstances, the
    appellant cannot advance to consideration  of  EX1  and  insurmountable
    obstacles. As held in Sabir (Appendix FM- EX1 not free standing) [2014]
    UKUT 00063 (IAC), EX1 is  not  a  free-standing  consideration  and  is
    parasitic on the relevant rules for leave to remain. That the  claimant
    could not meet the requirements of the Rules, either  paragraph  276ADE
    or Appendix FM, was a matter that should have been brought into account
    in the article 8 ECHR proportionality assessment outside the Rules.

10. I also agreed with the submissions that in effect the judge had applied
    a 'near miss' principle, and failed  to  have  proper  regard  for  the
    public interest considerations under section 117B of the  2002  Act,  a
    view now reinforced by the recent decision in AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015]
    UKUT 0260 (IAC). The appellant's continued immigration status in the UK
    was always precarious, dependent as it was on obtaining  further  leave
    to remain and thus little weight should be accorded to any private life
    developed in the UK. Further, little weight is to be  accorded  in  the
    proportionality balancing exercise to a  relationship  with  a  partner
    developed when he was unlawfully present in  the  UK,  having  obtained
    leave to remain first as  a  student  and  then  as  a  spouse  by  the
    fraudulent use of an English language test certificate.  In  error,  at
    �28 the judge stated that the appellant did not fall foul of any of the
    117B "requirements."

11. A further error is disclosed in �28 by  the  judge's  reliance  to  the
    claimant's credit in the proportionality balancing exercise that he  is
    able to speak English and is financially independent. As AM made clear,
    a claimant's human rights are not improved and cannot  accrue  'credit'
    for such matters: "An appellant can obtain no positive right to a grant
    of leave to remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever the degree of
    his fluency in English, or the strength of  his  financial  resources."
    Neither does the claimant acquire any positive benefit by reason of his
    immigration history, as held in Nasim & Ors  (Article  8)  [2014]  UKUT
    00025  (IAC):  "A  person's  human  rights  are  not  enhanced  by  not
    committing criminal offences or not relying on public funds.  The  only
    significance  of  such  matters  in  cases   concerning   proposed   or
    hypothetical removal from the UK is to preclude the Secretary of  State
    from pointing to any public interest justifying removal, over and above
    the basic  importance  of  maintain  a  firm  and  coherent  system  of
    immigration  control."  That  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
    interest  is  now  enshrined  in  section  117B,  which  Judge  Coleman
    acknowledged at �28 of the decision.

12.  Although  the  claimant  had  served  a  small  additional  bundle  of
    documentary evidence for the resumed hearing, Mr Ali elected to proceed
    by way of submissions only, on the basis that  there  was  no  need  to
    disturb the findings of fact made by Judge Coleman. To clarify, I asked
    Mr Ali to specify those findings upon which he relied. His reply was to
    read out a substantial portion of the decision of Judge Coleman and  to
    state that he relied on all the findings of fact.

13. Although I made no direction in my error of law decision and consequent
    directions as to whether any findings of fact should  be  preserved,  I
    accept that the primary findings of fact can stand as  made.  As  judge
    Coleman pointed out, at  �2,  the  basic  facts  are  not  in  dispute.
    However, when I invited Mr Ali to identify those findings on  which  he
    relied, it became clear that he not only  relied  on  the  findings  of
    Judge Coleman but her conclusions therefrom,  including,  for  example,
    the statement of the judge at �17 that "I had the  distinct  impression
    that if the appellant could not remain in the United Kingdom this is  a
    relationship which would fail."  With  respect  to  Mr  Ali  and  Judge
    Coleman, that is not a finding of fact, and I made it clear to  Mr  Ali
    that I did not consider the Tribunal bound by this or  similar  remarks
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, which are not findings  but,  at  the
    highest, conclusions based on primary facts. I do not accept that I  am
    bound to accept that the relationship would fail if the  claimant  were
    removed  from  the  UK.  Indeed,  as  Ms  Holmes  pointed  out  in  her
    submissions, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that it would be
    unjustifiably harsh to expect the wife to follow her  husband  and  for
    them to continue family life outside the UK. This was the submission of
    the representative of the Secretary of State at the First-tier Tribunal
    appeal hearing. Whilst the  wife  is  a  British  citizen,  she  is  of
    Bangladeshi origin and speaks Bengali. Although she has  not  remaining
    family of her own in Bangladesh, she  would  have  the  assistance  and
    protection of the claimant in making a new life in Bangladesh.  I  take
    into account  that  she  has  stated  that  she  would  not  return  to
    Bangladesh and never considered that might be the  consequence  of  her
    marriage. Of course, as a British citizen she  cannot  be  required  to
    leave the UK, but it will be a matter for  her  to  choose  whether  to
    accompany him or not.

14. However, I do accept the finding that the claimant's wife knew  nothing
    of his fraud in submitting a certificate for a test  he  did  not  take
    himself, and that she was shocked to discover that. The  relevance,  as
    relied by Mr Ali, and as acknowledged  by  the  judge  at  �23  of  her
    decision, is the rights of the wife must also  be  taken  into  account
    when considering the impact of the decision of the Secretary of  State.
    In her submissions and  reply,  Ms  Holmes  pointed  out  that  if  the
    claimant must succeed because his wife knew nothing of  his  fraud,  he
    would be doubly benefiting from his fraud,  having  deceived  both  the
    Secretary of State and his wife. Nevertheless, it is right that I  must
    and do take into  the  likely  effect  of  the  decision  on  both  the
    appellant and his wife.

15. Mr Ali accepted in his submissions that other conclusions of the  judge
    are not findings of fact but are in fact for me to decide, such as  the
    conclusion at �19 that the effect on the wife because of  the  decision
    and her husband's behaviour of which she was not  a  part,  constituted
    insurmountable obstacles to continuing family life in Bangladesh.

16. Mr Ali indicated at the outset of  his  submissions  that  he  did  not
    concede the issue of the Immigration Rules and the application of  EX1,
    but he did not pursue it and declined my invitation at  the  conclusion
    of his submissions to explain how the claimant could succeed under  the
    Rules. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out in the decision
    of Judge Coleman, I find that the claimant cannot meet the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain. That is a highly relevant
    factor to be brought into account in the article 8 ECHR proportionality
    exercise outside the Rules.

17. Mr Ali stated that the thrust of his submissions was that whilst on his
    own circumstances  the  claimant  would  be  unlikely  to  be  able  to
    demonstrate  that  the  removal  decision  is  disproportionate,   when
    combined with the circumstances of his wife, he should succeed  on  the
    basis of  family  life  under  article  8  ECHR  and  I  refer  to  his
    submissions, including those set out above.

18. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the appeal  must  fail  and
    that the decision is entirely proportionate and not disproportionate to
    the private and/or family life rights of the claimant and his wife.

19. In applying the Razgar stepped approach, I accept the  finding  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal that there is family life between the claimant  and
    his wife and that the decision to  remove  him  would  constitute  such
    grave interference with that family life so  as  to  engage  article  8
    ECHR.  The  crucial  question,  as  acknowledged  by  Mr  Ali,  is  the
    proportionality balancing exercise between on the one hand  the  rights
    of the appellant and his wife, and on  the  other  the  legitimate  and
    necessary aim of the state to protect the economic well-being of the UK
    through the application of immigration control.  This  public  interest
    consideration has now been enshrined in section 117B of  the  2002  Act
    and I am required to have  regard  to  it  and  in  particular  to  the
    principles set out by the Vice President in AM. Mr Ali  submitted  that
    AM is wrongly decided and wished to preserve his position in respect of
    the application of section 117B.

20. In his skeleton argument, Mr Ali seeks to rely  on  in  the  claimant's
    favour that he has now provided an English language certificate and was
    interviewed in English, and that he is not in receipt of public  funds.
    However, as AM held, the claimant can obtain no  positive  right  to  a
    grant of leave to remain because of  his  fluency  in  English  or  the
    strength of his financial resources. Further, again as stated above, at
    all times the claimant's immigration status  was  precarious  and  thus
    little weight should be accorded to any private life he  has  developed
    in the UK. Neither did his status as a student entitle him to either an
    expectation of leave to remain on the basis of private life.  In  Nasim
    and others (article 8) [2014] UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper  Tribunal
    considered whether the hypothetical removal of the  22  PBS  claimants,
    pursuant to the decision to refuse to vary  leave,  would  violate  the
    UK's obligations under  article  8  ECHR.  Whilst  each  case  must  be
    determined on its merits, the Tribunal noted that the judgements of the
    Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72, "serve to  re-
    focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8 of the ECHR and,
    in particular, to recognise that article's limited utility  in  private
    life cases that are far removed from the protection of an  individual's
    moral and physical integrity."

21. On the facts of this case, the claimant's true status  in  the  UK  was
    effectively unlawful. As stated above,  he  obtained  leave  to  remain
    first as a student and later as a spouse on the  basis  of  an  English
    language  certificate  to  which  he   was   not   entitled.   In   the
    circumstances, little weight should be given to the relationship formed
    with his wife, established at a time when he was effectively in the  UK
    unlawfully.

22. The claimant's dishonest and deliberately fraudulent conduct in seeking
    to remain in the UK when he  was  not  entitled  to  do  so  is  highly
    relevant to the public interest in  applying  immigration  control  and
    removing  him  from  the  UK,  and  to  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise. It is not in the public interest that he should benefit  from
    such disreputable conduct by being permitted to remain in the UK.

23. Those matters in  the  claimant's  favour  essentially  relate  to  the
    establishment of family life with a British citizen,  who  was  unaware
    that he had obtained leave to remain as her  spouse  by  dishonest  and
    fraudulent means. I fully take into account the devastating effect this
    potentially has on the relationship and her declaration that  she  will
    not go to Bangladesh. I also take into account all that has been  urged
    upon me from the findings of fact of the First-tier Tribunal as to  her
    private and family circumstances in the UK; these matters should not be
    underestimated and weigh significantly in the claimant's favour. I have
    carefully considered his wife's rights to  family  life.  However,  the
    proportionality balancing exercise is just that, a  balancing  exercise
    between the rights of both the claimant and his  wife  and  the  public
    interest in securing his removal  from  the  UK.  As  stated,  in  that
    balancing exercise the scales are heavily weighted against the claimant
    by the relevant public  interest  factors  of  section  117B,  and  his
    disreputable and fraudulent conduct in relation to immigration control.
    In the final analysis I find that the decision is  proportionate,  even
    if it means that  the  claimant  and  his  wife  separate.  It  is  not
    necessarily the case that this will be the  consequence,  as  it  is  a
    matter for her to choose whether to accompany him, but  her  rights  to
    family life do not, in my view, outweigh the  very  significant  public
    interest in removing a person such as this claimant from  the  UK.  The
    Rules as amended are the Secretary of State's  response  to  article  8
    private and family life rights claims and are designed to be article  8
    compliant. Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance  with  the  Rules,
    which he cannot meet, primarily because of his own  dishonest  conduct.
    The claimant is not entitled to settle in the UK just because  that  is
    and evidently has always been his intention. Neither does the fact that
    being unlawfully present, or having engineered his  continued  presence
    by fraud on the Secretary of State, entitle him to remain just  because
    he concealed that fraud from his wife.

Decision

24. The appeal is dismissed on immigration  grounds  and  on  human  rights
    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
