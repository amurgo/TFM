                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Anne-Marie Tootell), sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  11
    September 2013, to  an appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born 6 December
    1984, to the extent of directing the  Home  Office  to  reconsider  his
    application under the 'legacy' policy.

 2. Permission to appeal was given on the basis  that  AZ  (Asylum-  legacy
    cases) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT 270 (IAC) should have led the judge to a
    different result. Both sides should have referred her to this decision,
    but apparently neither did. However,  Mr  Bramble  conceded  before  me
    that, even if the judge had been referred to it, she  would  have  been
    entitled to distinguish it, on the basis that the decision under appeal
    in this case was not a fresh immigration decision, but  one  under  the
    'legacy' policy, which in her view had not been properly considered. So
    he withdrew the Home Office appeal, and the judge's decision stands.

Home Office appeal withdrawn
