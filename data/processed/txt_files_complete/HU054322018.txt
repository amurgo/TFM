                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. N. Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. P. Saini, Counsel instructed by Synthesis
Chambers Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Eban, promulgated on 3 October 2018, in  which  she
    allowed Mr. Sandhu's appeal against the Secretary of  State's  decision
    to refuse leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  human  rights
    grounds.


 2. For the purposes of this decision I refer to the Secretary of State  as
    the Respondent, and to Mr. Sandhu as the  Appellant,  reflecting  their
    positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows


         "The grounds seeking permission assert  that  the  Judge  erred  in
         failing to apply the reasoning in R (on the application of Khan)  v
         SSHD (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018]  UKUT  00384
         (IAC).  Specifically, it was said that she had failed  to  consider
         the factors mentioned in that case  when  determining  whether  the
         Appellant had been dishonest or merely  careless  in  his  dealings
         with HMRC or UKVI.


         In her decision, the Judge attached weight to  a  letter  from  the
         Appellant's accountant which indicated that errors in  one  of  his
         tax returns were attributable to a  junior  member  of  staff.   In
         relation to another return, the Judge concluded that the Respondent
         had erred in a comparison of earnings which overlapped between  two
         tax periods.


         No complaint is made in the grounds relating to the  2012/2013  tax
         return.  Nevertheless, there is nothing to suggest that  the  Judge
         was directed to the decision above.  I consider  that,  absent  any
         explanation as to why the Appellant  had  not  realised  the  error
         (which resulted in an underpayment of tax of over  �4,000),  it  is
         arguable that the Judge erred in failing to make adequate  findings
         in accordance with the decision in Khan.   Accordingly,  permission
         to appeal is granted."


 4. The Appellant attended the hearing.   I  heard  submissions  from  both
    representatives following which I reserved my decision.

 5. It was accepted that, at the time of promulgation of  the  decision,  3
    October 2018, the decision of Khan had not been reported.  Khan was not
    reported until November 2018.  Both representatives relied on the  case
    of Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673.

Error of Law

 6. The Judge states at [15], [16] and [17]:


         "In the light of the accountant's letter taking responsibility  for
         the error, I accept that the appellant inadvertently under-declared
         his self-employed income for 2010/2011 and in May 2016 he corrected
         that  under-declaration.   The  difference  is  �12,743  which   is
         substantial in the context of the  appellant'  receipts  and  which
         gave rise to an  additional  tax  liability  of  �4,283.72,  almost
         double  the  previous  assessment.   Whilst  I  accept   that   the
         responsibility for accounting properly for income is always that of
         the taxpayer, I find that the appellant was entitled to rely on his
         accountant to prepare and submit the correct figures to HMRC. [15]


         HMRC has a  discretion  to  decide  how  to  proceed  in  cases  of
         underpayment of tax, and in particular, whether  to  prosecute  the
         offender or to recover the  underpaid  tax  and  penalties  without
         commencing proceedings, pursuant to the  provisions  of  the  Taxes
         Management  Act  1970.   HMRC  exercised  its  discretion  in   the
         applicant's favour. [16]


         In the circumstances, and in reliance on the accountant's letter  I
         find that the appellant was not dishonest  when  he  submitted  his
         original 2010/2011 tax return and  his  application  for  leave  to
         remain dated 24 March 2011." [17]


 7. The Judge considers the alternative to her finding that  the  Appellant
    was not dishonest at [23] and [24].  At [24] she states:


         "I find that not declaring all relevant income,  even  deliberately
         whilst highly regrettable, cannot be equated  to  conduct  such  as
         that set out in the policy guidance.  The appellant  has  not  been
         involved in criminality.  It  cannot  properly  be  said  that  his
         failure to disclose (if there was a failure)  calls  into  question
         his character, conduct and associations.  There  is  no  suggestion
         that he has been or is a threat to national security or subject  to
         a travel ban or has been involved  in  a  sham  marriage.   In  the
         circumstances I find that paragraph 322(5) would not apply in  this
         case."


 8. I find that [24] involves the making of an error of  law  as  paragraph
    322(5) can be used by  the  Respondent  where  there  is  a  difference
    between the accounts submitted to HMRC and to the Secretary  of  State.
    This is confirmed by [35] and [37(2)] of Balajigari which refer to  the
    use of paragraph 322(5) where  there  is  a  deliberate  and  dishonest
    submission of false earnings.  [37(2)] states:


         "We would accept that as a matter of  principle  dishonest  conduct
         will not always and in every  case  reach  a  sufficient  level  of
         seriousness, but in the context of an earnings discrepancy case  it
         is very hard to see how the deliberate and dishonest submission  of
         false earnings figures, whether to HMRC  or  to  the  Home  Office,
         would not do so."


 9. However, a case  where  there  are  discrepant  earnings  figures  only
    engages paragraph 322(5) where there has been  dishonesty.   The  Judge
    found that there had not been dishonesty in the Appellant's  case,  and
    for that  reason  she  found  that  paragraph  322(5)  did  not  apply.
    Therefore, although she has erred at [24], this is only material if she
    has erred in her finding that  Appellant  was  not  dishonest  when  he
    submitted his 2010/2011 tax return.  These findings are set out at [12]
    to [17], and summarised at [22].


10. It was submitted by Mr. Bramble that the case of Khan was  approved  by
    Balajigari.  I was referred to [40].  In response, Mr. Saini  submitted
    that there was a difference, as made clear at [42] which states:


         "A discrepancy between the earnings declared to  HMRC  and  to  the
         Home Office may justifiably give rise to a suspicion that it is the
         result of dishonesty but it does not by itself justify a conclusion
         to that effect. What it does is to call for an explanation.  If  an
         explanation once sought is not forthcoming, or is unconvincing,  it
         may at that point be legitimate for the Secretary of State to infer
         dishonesty; but even in that case the position is not that there is
         a legal  burden  on  the  applicant  to  disprove  dishonesty.  The
         Secretary of State must simply decide, considering the  discrepancy
         in the light of the explanation (or lack  of  it),  whether  he  is
         satisfied that the applicant has been dishonest.


11. This makes clear that the fact of a discrepancy  between  the  earnings
    declared may justifiably give rise to a suspicion that it is the result
    of dishonesty, but it does not by itself show that  it  is  dishonesty.
    Applying this to the Appellant's situation, there is a discrepancy,  so
    the Appellant must offer an explanation.

12. I find that the Appellant offered an explanation which  was  considered
    by Judge Eban.  This explanation was in the form  of  his  accountant's
    letter.  The nature of the letter  is  set  out  at  [13].   The  Judge
    expressed some concerns with it at [14] but made clear that  there  was
    no challenge to this letter or its reliability, and accepted it at face
    value.  In this letter the Appellant's accountant  took  responsibility
    for the error, as set out at [13] and [15].  It is highly relevant that
    that there was no challenge to this letter, or to  the  explanation  it
    contained.

13. The Respondent asserts that the Judge did not follow the steps set  out
    in Khan when considering this letter.  However the Judge had found that
    there was no challenge to this letter, which addressed the suspicion of
    dishonesty which arose as a result of  the  discrepancy.   It  was  not
    submitted that the explanation  was  implausible  (headnote  (v)(i)  of
    Khan).  In the absence of a challenge to  the  letter,  the  Judge  was
    entitled to rely on it.  She found  at  [15]  that  the  Appellant  was
    entitled to rely on his  accountant  and  she  therefore  accepted  the
    explanation.  There is no error in her reliance on this letter.

14. She further considered the actions of HMRC when coming to  her  finding
    that the Appellant had not been dishonest [16].   There  was  a  letter
    from HMRC dated 5 October 2016 in the Respondent's bundle.  This stated
    that the Appellant had amended his tax return  for  the  year  ended  5
    April 2011, but not until June 2016.  The letter states:


         "You did not send us your amendment at the  right  time.   We  view
         this as a failure to take reasonable care with your tax affairs for
         the above period."


15. It was submitted by Mr. Saini that this letter  was  evidence  that  an
    assessment been carried out by HMRC following the late submission of an
    amendment by the Appellant.  At [16] the Judge states that HMRC  has  a
    discretion to decide how to  proceed,  and  that  "HMRC  exercised  its
    discretion in the applicant's (sic) favour".

16. Mr. Saini referred me to [35] of Balajigari.   This states:


         "As to the first two limbs, Mr Biggs' position was that an earnings
         discrepancy  case  could  constitute   sufficiently   reprehensible
         conduct for the purpose of paragraph 322 (5) if  but  only  if  the
         discrepancy was the  result  of  dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the
         applicant. That was not disputed on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
         State, and in our view it is correct. The provision  of  inaccurate
         earnings figures either to HMRC or to the Home Office in support of
         an application for  leave  under  Part  6A  as  a  result  of  mere
         carelessness or ignorance or poor advice cannot constitute  conduct
         rendering it undesirable for the applicant to  remain  in  the  UK.
         Errors so caused are, however regrettable, "genuine" or  "innocent"
         in the sense that they are honest, and do not  meet  the  necessary
         threshold."


17. He submitted that it was clear that  HMRC  considered  the  Appellant's
    behaviour akin to carelessness rather than dishonesty.  The  fact  that
    HMRC considered the Appellant's behaviour to  be  "a  failure  to  take
    reasonable care" was evidence that in their view  it  was  carelessness
    and nothing more.  Carelessness could not equate to dishonesty.


18. I find that the Judge was entitled  to  find  at  [16]  that  HMRC  had
    exercised discretion in the Appellant's favour, given this letter.    I
    find that the Respondent was aware when the decision was made that HMRC
    had not taken  any  action.   He  was  aware  that  HMRC  had  made  an
    assessment of the Appellant's situation and had  concluded  that  there
    had been "a failure to take reasonable care".  It  was  submitted  that
    HMRC do not necessarily carry out an assessment in every case,  but  in
    the Appellant's case they had done so.


19. Balajigari states at [74]:


         "We further bear in mind that there would be nothing to prevent the
         applicant from drawing attention to the fact that HMRC had enquired
         into a matter and had decided  not  to  impose  a  penalty  or  had
         decided to impose a penalty at a lower rate, which  signified  that
         there had been carelessness rather than dishonesty. That  would  be
         information which was within an applicant's own knowledge and  they
         could draw this to the attention of the Secretary of State."


20. It was submitted at [1(e)] of the grounds that  the  lack  of  punitive
    action was "legally irrelevant when considering if the appellant  acted
    dishonestly".  However, as set out in Balajigari, it was right for  the
    Appellant to have drawn this to the attention of the Respondent.  It is
    clear that the HMRC had assessed the situation and considered that  the
    Appellant had not acted dishonestly.  The Judge was  entitled  to  take
    this into account.  I find that  there  is  no  error  in  the  Judge's
    finding at [16].

21. Although the Judge did not go through each and every aspect set out  in
    Khan, as made clear by Balajigari, the discrepancy itself can only give
    rise to a suspicion of dishonesty, not dishonesty  itself.   The  Judge
    considered the explanation given for the discrepancy, and decided  that
    the Respondent's concerns had been addressed.  There was  no  challenge
    to the accountant's  letter  which  provided  an  explanation  for  the
    discrepancy.  The Judge further found, as  was  already  known  to  the
    Respondent, that HMRC had assessed the Appellant's case and had decided
    not to take any action.  I find that there is no material error of  law
    in the Judge's finding that the Appellant had not practised dishonesty.

22. Therefore, any error that the Judge  may  have  made  at  [24]  is  not
    material as there is no error in her finding that the Appellant did not
    use dishonesty.  As the Appellant had not used  dishonesty,  the  Judge
    was entitled to find that paragraph 322(5) did not apply.

Decision

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve the making  of
    an error of law and I do not set it aside.


24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

25. No anonymity direction is made.
