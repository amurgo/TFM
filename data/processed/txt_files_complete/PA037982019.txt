                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent



                           DECISION AND DIRECTION


The Tribunal issued a preliminary decision dated 21 November 2019  proposing
that an error of law be found and the  appeal  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for re-making.

The parties were directed to respond no later  than  28  November  2019.  No
response would be deemed as consent to the disposal set out above.

Neither party has responded.

 3. I therefore allow the appeal  where  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal contained an error of law for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the
    preliminary decision. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is  set
    aside. The appeal will be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-
    made.



DECISION

 4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error on a point of
    law and is set aside.

 5. The appeal will be re-made by the First-tier Tribunal other than  Judge
    M A Khan.
