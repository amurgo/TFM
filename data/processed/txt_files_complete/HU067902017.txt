For the Appellant:     Mrs F Farrell, of Peter G Farrell, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against the decision of  FtT  Judge  J  C  Grant-
    Hutchison, promulgated on 12 June 2018.

 2. The grounds, lightly edited, are as follows:

         "[1]     The judge made an adverse  finding  at  [16]  against  the
         appellant's adoptive father because he left Ethiopia to try to join
         his wife in Sudan, later returning to Ethiopia, and  because  after
         succeeding in his appeal, he left the appellant in Ethiopia to join
         his wife in the UK.  This failed to take account of the  fact  that
         the sponsor is a refugee entitled  to  family  reunion.   She  fled
         Ethiopia through necessity rather than desire.  Her  husband  would
         understandably wish to join his wife.   The judge's  assessment  of
         the facts  affected  her  subsequent  proportionality  decision  in
         relation to article 8 of the ECHR. She clearly accepts at [15] that
         the applicant was orphaned then went to live with the  sponsor  and
         her husband on 17 June 2008. At [17 (d)] the judge states correctly
         that her father can visit her in  Ethiopia  because  he  is  not  a
         refugee however she fails to make any findings with regard  to  the
         sponsor who cannot enter Ethiopia as she is a refugee.

         [2]      At [21] the judge finds that the interference ... for  the
         maintenance of effective immigration  control  is  proportionate...
         The Home Office Policy on Family Reunion  can  be  considered  even
         though the applicant does not meet the strict requirements  of  the
         immigration rules. The respondent's  decision  and  reconsideration
         relied in part on the assertion that the applicant had  not  formed
         part of the sponsor's family unit before she fled Ethiopia and  ...
         could remain in Ethiopia with her father who had also been refused.
         The case of Al-Anizi was referred to in submissions... at  [15]  it
         quotes from the ... policy and states  that  "success  outside  the
         rules" is specifically contemplated, case workers being enjoined to
         consider "the family exceptional circumstances guidance or  whether
         there are any compassionate factors"."

 3. Permission was granted by FtT Judge Scott-Baker on 26 September 2018.

 4. Mrs Farrell (fairly and correctly) drew attention  to  a  slip  in  the
    grant.  It says that arguably the judge erred by not  recognising  that
    the sponsor's husband "was also a  refugee  and  could  not  return  to
    Ethiopia".  In fact, he came to the UK as a spouse, and  has  not  been
    recognised as a refugee.

 5. The grant continues, "There was no clear finding on whether family life
    existed and the finding  at  [12]  that  the  consequences  of  refusal
    potentially engaged article 8 was [arguably] unreasoned."

 6. The respondent's rule 24 response dated 24 October 2018 says  that  the
    judge evidently did consider there to be  family  life,  and  that  she
    undertook a careful proportionality balancing exercise, taking  account
    of the appellant's best interests.

 7. Mrs Farrell submitted along the lines of the grounds.  She referred  to
    R (on the application of Al-Anizy) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department (undocumented Bidoons -  Home  Office  policy)  [2017]  UKUT
    00197 (IAC) at [25]:

         "Second, I consider  that  the  Secretary  of  State's  failure  to
         examine the family reunification applications on their  merits  and
         determine them accordingly infringes the rights of all  six  family
         members  under  Article  8(1)  ECHR.   Third,  given  that  it   is
         manifestly in the best interests of the children concerned that the
         family unit be recomposed in the United Kingdom, there has  been  a
         clear breach of section 55(1) of the 2009 Act  (vis-ï¿½-vis  the  two
         older children) and the  Secretary  of  State's  policy  which,  in
         substance, applies section 55  without  material  qualification  to
         children outside the United Kingdom such as the  third  and  fourth
         children of this family."

 8. Mrs Farrell relied also upon the following passage at the  end  of  the
    respondent's policy:

         Family  reunion:  for  refugees   and   those   with   humanitarian
         protection. Version 2.0. Publication date: 29 July 2016

         ...

         Applications from children on the  basis  that  they  are  de-facto
         adopted children may be made  under  the  provisions  for  de-facto
         adopted children in the Immigration Rules. However, if the  sponsor
         is in the UK, a de-facto adoption application under the Immigration
         Rules is bound to fail because the Immigration Rules define  a  de-
         facto adoption in a specific way  and  require  the  parent  to  be
         living  with  the  de-facto  adopted  child  at  the  time  of  the
         application. Such cases must then  be  considered  under  paragraph
         319X as set out above. The requirement to consider  Article  8  and
         compassionate factors also applies. If the separation  of  the  de-
         facto adopted child and the sponsoring parent has been due entirely
         to the need to  flee  persecution  that  specific  fact  should  be
         properly  taken  into  account  and  need  not  weigh  against  the
         applicant if all the other evidence points to  a  genuine  de-facto
         adoption.

 9. The further points which I took from the submissions and the reply  for
    the appellant were these:

      i) The judge appeared  to  accept  many  of  the  contentions  of  the
         appellant, which disclosed  family  life,  but  failed  to  make  a
         finding accordingly.

     ii) The judge did not make a finding on the inability of  the  sponsor,
         the appellant's (adoptive) mother, to visit her, and failed to take
         that into account in assessing proportionality.

    iii) Correctly applying Al-Anizi and the respondent's policy, the appeal
         should have been allowed in the FtT, and the UT should reverse  the
         outcome.

     iv) The decision of the ECO on 6/4/17 and the  reconsideration  by  the
         ECM on  19/2/18  were  both  based  on  the  appellant  having  the
         sponsor's husband with her in Ethiopia.  By the  time  of  the  FtT
         hearing he had joined the sponsor in the UK.  The judge  failed  to
         appreciate the significance of the appellant no longer  being  with
         either of her adoptive parents.

10. The main points which I took from the submissions  for  the  respondent
    were these:

      i) The statutory ground of appeal was limited to whether the  decision
         was unlawful under section 6  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998,  a
         general ground which did not relate directly to any policy.

     ii) The ECO's decision explicitly considered the case in terms of human
         rights and the scope for appeal, outside the rules.

    iii) It was accepted that policy might be relevant to whether a decision
         was in breach of human rights, but it could not be decisive.

     iv) In any event, the terms of the policy, applied to the facts of this
         case, did not indicate another outcome.

      v) The facts in Al-Anizi were very different.  It was not an authority
         which assisted the appellant, because in  this  case,  it  was  not
         established that it would be "manifestly in the best interests"  of
         the child to enter the UK.

     vi) On unchallenged findings of the judge,  the  appellant's  interests
         were not damaged by continuing to live as she did.

    vii) The judge stated no explicit conclusion on whether there was family
         life between appellant and sponsor, but obviously did so find.  The
         decision from the first sentence of [12]  onwards  was  written  on
         that assumption, and otherwise would have been otiose.

   viii) The decision at [16] was not an adverse finding,  but  an  accurate
         narration.

     ix) If the facts narrated at [16] had been taken  as  not  helping  the
         appellant's case, there was no error in that.

      x) The judge was aware that the sponsor is a  refugee,  to  which  she
         made several references.  She might have left to avoid persecution,
         but the other parent did  not.   His  departure  was  a  matter  of
         choice.  The evidence indicated that  he  was  satisfied  that  the
         circumstances in  which  the  appellant  was  left  were  at  least
         adequate.

     xi) The judge at [14 & 17 - 19] found the appellant to  be  well  cared
         for in a stable home.  Uprooting her from  her  environment  was  a
         major consideration.  The judge rejected contentions about  dangers
         and difficulties with her schooling.   She  found  the  appellant's
         grandmother to be a strong and capable individual, and declined  to
         accept that she was in declining health, on which her evidence  was
         self-contradictory.  She found no reason for the appellant  not  to
         continue living with  her  grandmother  in  Ethiopia,  of  for  the
         sponsor and her husband not to continue with financial support.  No
         error was suggested in those findings.

    xii) It was relevant that the appellant has lived only for a short  time
         with the sponsor, for interrupted periods  with  her  husband,  and
         throughout her life close to or with her grandmother.

   xiii) The judge might have considered paragraph 319X of  the  immigration
         rules, as suggested by the policy, even though the application  had
         been made by another route.  However, that would not have  assisted
         the  appellant,  as  she  did  not  provide   evidence   that   the
         requirements   of   the   rules,   including   "accommodation   and
         maintenance", could be met.

    xiv) In relation to s.117B of the 2002 Act, at [20], the judge was wrong
         to think that as a minor the appellant is  not  expected  to  speak
         English or to be financially  independent  (the  latter  point  not
         being  restricted  to  her  personal  resources).   However,  those
         matters were incidental to the decision, were not mentioned in  the
         grounds, and the error went in the appellant's favour.

     xv) The judge accordingly reached a decision on  proportionality  which
         was open to her, left  no  relevant  factor  out  of  account,  and
         disclosed no error of law.

11. I reserved my decision.

12. The decision at  [16]  is  not  an  adverse  finding  but  an  accurate
    narration.

13. To the extent that the judge took the circumstances  set  out  at  [16]
    into account in her proportionality assessment, they were relevant, and
    no error arises.

14. The proportionality assessment included recognition  that  the  sponsor
    has been recognised as a refugee, and has been joined by  her  husband.
    There  has  been  no  debate  over  the  correct  date  at  which   the
    circumstances fell to be assessed, but the decision plainly treats that
    as the date at which the appellant put  her  case.    The  decision  is
    based on the existence of family life, and  on  the  sponsor's  husband
    being in the UK - i.e., on circumstances at the date  of  the  hearing,
    not of the ECO's or ECM's decisions.

15. The respondent's policy does not say that all de-facto adopted children
    of refugees have a right of entry into the UK.  Rather,  it  recognises
    that if an adoption is not official but  is  genuine,  the  absence  of
    legal formality should not stand in an applicant's way.  All depends on
    the individual facts.

16. In Al-Anizi it was manifestly in the best interests of the children  to
    come to the UK.  The FtT found in this case that there was  "no  reason
    for the appellant not to continue living with her  grandmother  in  her
    home country".  The case that her interests would be better  served  by
    coming to the UK was weak.

17. The absence of direct reference of paragraph 319X of the rules  is  not
    significant.   There  was  no  evidence  to  cover  "accommodation  and
    maintenance".  The rule also requires "serious and compelling family or
    other circumstances which make exclusion  of  the  child  undesirable".
    Although not directed to that specific test, the judge  found  that  no
    such circumstances had been established.

18. There is nothing in the rules, case law, or policy which  requires  the
    contrary outcome on the facts found by the FtT.

19. The case for the appellant has been advanced on all  available  points,
    both in the FtT and in the UT.  The submissions for the  respondent  in
    the UT, however, are well founded.  The judge made no error in arriving
    at the primary facts.  Her decision on proportionality was open to her,
    was firmly rooted in those facts, and did not involve the making of any
    error  on  a  point  of  law.   The  grounds,  in  the  end,  are  only
    disagreement with her assessment.

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
