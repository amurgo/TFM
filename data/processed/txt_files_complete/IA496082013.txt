Appellant:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Respondent:   Unrepresented


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal originates in a decision made on behalf of  the  Appellant,
    the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  (the  "Secretary  of
    State"), dated  14  November  2013,  whereby  the  application  of  the
    Respondent,  a national of India aged 25 years, for leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  was  refused.
    The reason for refusal was expressed in the following terms:

         "...   You  would  have  to  prove  that  you  have  the   required
         maintenance fees of �1,600 plus any outstanding course fees for the
         first year of your course ....

         Your course fees are �8,500 for the first year of your  course  and
         you have paid �4,250 towards this fee ...  You are required to show
         that you are in possession of  �5,850  for  a  consecutive  28  day
         period ....

         As the closing dates of the bank statements ............... are  25
         September 2013, you need to show evidence of �5,850 maintenance for
         28 days from 29 August 2013 to 25 September 2013.  However, between
         29 August 2013 and 17 September 2013  your  bank  statements  state
         that you were in possession, in total, of no more than �1,602.18."

    The  application  was,  therefore,  refused  on  the  ground  that  the
    Respondent  failed  to  satisfy  the  maintenance  (funds)  requirement
    enshrined in the relevant provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  viz
    paragraph 245ZX and Appendix C.

 2. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  (the  "FtT"),  which  was
    made without a hearing, considered the evidence provided,  including  a
    letter from the Respondent's university dated 22 November  2013.   This
    letter details that the course which the Respondent was pursuing  began
    on 10 September 2013 and was scheduled to finish on 19  December  2014.
    It continues:

         "I acknowledge there was some confusion over the  payment  of  fees
         but I wish to confirm that all outstanding fees have been paid."

    As we observed at the hearing, we consider it important  to  categorise
    this letter correctly.  It did not constitute  fresh  evidence  in  the
    sense of the belated provision of something which, per the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules, should have been provided with the underlying
    information. Rather, it  constituted  evidence  bearing  on  the  facts
    obtaining at the material time.  There  was,  therefore,  no  statutory
    prohibition on its admissibility and the contrary  was  not  argued  on
    behalf of the Appellant.

 3. In his determination the Judge said the following of the letter:

         "It is clear from the university letter of 22  November  2013  that
         'all outstanding fees have been paid'. I  therefore  take  that  to
         mean that by the date of decision the total course fee  payment  of
         �8,500 had been met. It is unfortunate that the  precise  date  for
         that is unclear from the appeal papers, but I  give  the  Appellant
         the benefit of the doubt in the round."

    Within the grant of permission to appeal, one  finds  two  contentions.
    The first is that it is not clear whether the appeal was allowed  under
    the Immigration Rules or Article  8  ECHR.   The  second  is  that  the
    decision is insufficiently reasoned.

 4. With due respect to the permission  Judge,  we  find  no  substance  in
    either of these grounds.  We consider  it  abundantly  clear  from  the
    determination as  a  whole  that  the  appeal  was  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Since  the  letter  from  the  university  did  not
    contain chapter and verse relating to the payment of the  course  fees,
    it was incumbent upon the Judge to analyse and construe  it.   This  he
    did.  The only basis upon which his assessment and construction of  the
    letter and the ensuing finding made by him could be challenged is  that
    of irrationality.  This entails an elevated threshold which is  plainly
    not overcome. The Judge's evaluation of the letter clearly  lay  within
    the band of what  was  open  to  a  reasonable  Judge,  properly  self-
    directed. When one takes into account all of the objective evidence, it
    was plainly open to the Judge to conclude that the course fees had been
    paid in full by the Respondent at the time when the  impugned  decision
    was made.  Thus the various calculations contained in the decision were
    erroneous.  The effect of the Judge's finding in relation to payment of
    the course fees was that the application should have been allowed.

 5. Nor do we find any substance in the complaint of inadequate  reasoning.
    It is appropriate to make the observation that this was not one of  the
    complaints advanced in the application for permission to appeal.  Given
    the markedly narrow dimensions of the issue to be decided by the Judge,
    we consider the reasoning perfectly clear.  The determination hinges on
    a finding which, as rehearsed  above,  we  consider  unassailable.   We
    would add that there is no sustainable complaint of misdirection in the
    determination.  The Judge noted, correctly, that the  burden  of  proof
    was on the Respondent and the applicable standard of proof was that  of
    the  balance  of  probabilities.  The  formulation  contained  in   the
    penultimate paragraph of the determination  viz  "the  benefit  of  the
    doubt in the round" is to be considered in this  context  and,  in  our
    judgment, discloses no error of law.

DECISION

 6. For the reasons elaborated above, the appeal is dismissed.
