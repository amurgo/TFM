                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant: Unrepresented
For the Respondent: Mr G Harrison Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Appellant was  born  on  25  February  1973  and  is  a  national  of
   Pakistan.
3. The Appellant came to the  UK  as  a  student  in  2011.  His  leave  was
   extended in 2013. On 2 December 2014 his leave was curtailed and  expired
   on 3 February 2015.
4. On 13 February 2015 he applied  for  a  residence  card  as  an  extended
   family member of an EEA citizen namely Constantina Ioana Dobaccan on  the
   basis that they were in a durable relationship and  his  application  was
   refused in a letter dated 30 June 2015.
5. The Appellant appealed against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
   Aspden which was  promulgated  on  25  January  2016  and  dismissed  the
   Appellant's appeal against a refusal of a residence card as  conformation
   of his right to reside in the UK. He was  granted  permission  to  appeal
   that decision on 1 July 2016 and on 30 September 2016 I found an error of
   law in the Judges decision and adjourned the case to  be  reheard  before
   me.
6. However the case of Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411  (IAC)
   has since been drawn to my attention. In that case it  was  decided  that
   there is no statutory  right  of  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
   Secretary of State not to grant a Residence Card to a person claiming  to
   be an Extended Family Member. This Appellant claimed to be in  a  durable
   relationship with an EEA national and therefore his claim for a Residence
   Card was based on his claim to be an extended family member  of  the  EEA
   national. Sala makes clear there was no  right  of  appeal  against  that
   decision.
Conclusion
7. The Appellant has no right of appeal.
8. There is no valid appeal before the Upper Tribunal
