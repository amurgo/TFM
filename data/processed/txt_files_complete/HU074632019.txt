Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Sharif, of Fountain Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Lindsay, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Pakistani national who was born on 5 May 1981.   She
    seeks to join her husband, a British citizen who was born  on  9  April
    1939, in the United Kingdom.  On 8 January 2020, her appeal against the
    ECO's refusal of that application was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Parkes ("the judge").  On 6 April 2020, the appellant was granted
    permission  to  appeal  against  the  judge's  decision  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Murray.

Background

 2. The appellant and the sponsor married in  Rawalpindi  on  28  September
    2016.  She subsequently made an application for entry  clearance  as  a
    spouse.  The application was refused because the  ECO  did  not  accept
    that the marriage was valid or that the relationship  was  genuine  and
    subsisting.

 3. That decision was maintained on review and, on 25 May 2018,  an  appeal
    against the refusal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox.  Having
    considered the papers and having heard the sponsor give evidence, Judge
    Fox found that the marriage was not valid and that the relationship was
    not a genuine or subsisting one.  He expressed  a  number  of  concerns
    which led him to those  conclusions.   The  death  certificate  of  the
    sponsor's first wife was thought to be of little probative  value;  the
    appellant had chosen to return to her parents' house before the sponsor
    left Pakistan; she had provided no  witness  statement  and  there  was
    nothing to suggest that she had been actively involved in the  decision
    to marry the sponsor and neither the telephone records  nor  the  money
    remittance slips showed contact or support  passing  between  appellant
    and sponsor.

 4. A further application was made on 30 October 2018.  The ECO checked the
    death certificate with the Union Council,  which  confirmed  it  to  be
    genuine.  Interviews with the appellant and the sponsor took  place  by
    telephone.  The ECO was not satisfied that the marriage was genuine and
    subsisting.  There was little evidence of a genuine relationship.   The
    telephone calls and remittances  held  little  weight.   There  was  no
    evidence to show why the sponsor had not travelled to see the appellant
    since they married.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant appealed for a second time.  Her appeal was heard by  the
    judge, sitting at Birmingham  on  20  December  2019.   He  heard  oral
    evidence from the sponsor and  submissions  from  Mr  Sharif,  for  the
    appellant, and Mr Lawson, the Presenting Officer  who  represented  the
    respondent at that stage.

 6. In his reserved decision, the judge  directed  himself  to  take  Judge
    Fox's decision as his starting point: [6] and  [12].   For  reasons  he
    gave at [12]-[22], he concluded that the evidence  did  not  justify  a
    departure from Judge Fox's findings.  At [15], he noted the contents of
    the appellant's affidavit, in which she stated  that  the  marriage  is
    genuine and subsisting; that  she  was  in  regular  contact  with  the
    sponsor; and that she was maintained by him.  At [16]-[17],  the  judge
    noted the evidence in relation to the sponsor's medical conditions  and
    his suspected Parkinson's disease.  The evidence did not show that  the
    sponsor was unfit to travel in 2017 or 2018 and the absence of a  visit
    was a 'troubling aspect of the case':  [18].   The  judge  also  shared
    Judge Fox's concern that the appellant had  returned  to  her  parents'
    house before the sponsor returned to the UK: [18].  There  was  also  a
    discrepancy in the evidence regarding the sponsor's  relationship  with
    his family in the UK: [19].  More family  support  from  the  sponsor's
    side 'might have been expected': [20].  At [21], the judge  noted  that
    there were a number of supportive affidavits from people who  knew  the
    appellant and the sponsor but 'those reflect their views and have to be
    set against the evidence considered above'.  The  interviews  with  the
    appellant and the sponsor had been taken into account but did  not  add
    to the analysis: [21].

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. In concise grounds  of  appeal,  Mr  Sharif  advances  two  complaints.
    Firstly, that the  judge  overlooked  evidence  before  him,  including
    remittance slips, telephone records and affidavits, in concluding  that
    the relationship was not genuine and subsisting.   Secondly,  that  the
    judge had overlooked cultural considerations in attaching weight to the
    appellant's decision to return to the family home  before  the  sponsor
    flew back to the UK.

 8. In his oral submissions, Mr Sharif asked me to note that there had been
    39 Moneygram receipts and many pages of call records before the  judge.
    These had not been considered and [15] of the judge's decision did  not
    represent adequate engagement with this evidence.  There was no finding
    on the affidavit evidence of the family members, which had appeared  at
    pp167-174 of the appellant's bundle.  The judge had  misunderstood  the
    situation prior to the sponsor's return to the UK;  the  appellant  was
    upset by his departure but it would not  have  been  safe  for  her  to
    remain on her own after the sponsor left Pakistan.

 9. Mr Lindsay submitted that the judge had understood the interview record
    perfectly well and had been entitled  to  attach  significance  to  the
    appellant's decision to return to the family home before the  sponsor's
    departure.  The point was not said to be particularly important in  any
    event.  The affidavits had obviously been taken  into  account.   There
    were clear reasons given by the judge for finding that the relationship
    was  not  genuine  or  subsisting.   There  was  a  previous   judicial
    conclusion to that effect and the evidence  which  had  been  submitted
    subsequently was insufficient to justify a contrary conclusion.

10. In response, Mr Sharif submitted that there  was  intervening  devotion
    and that the judge was obliged to consider the evidence of the same.

11. I reserved my decision.

Analysis

12. As I have already noted, this was the  appellant's  second  attempt  to
    secure entry clearance as the sponsor's wife.  They married in 2016 but
    her first application was refused and her first appeal was dismissed by
    Judge Fox on 4 July 2018.  She took  further  advice  and  submitted  a
    second application.  That  was  also  refused,  although  the  previous
    ground of refusal about the validity of the marriage fell away in light
    of the confirmation from the Union Council.

13. By the time the appeal came before the judge, it was obviously accepted
    on all sides that Judge Fox's decision was the Devaseelan [2003] Imm AR
    1 starting point but the appellant's case was that there was now cogent
    evidence justifying a different conclusion.  There were affidavits from
    people in Pakistan who testified to the bona fides of the relationship.
     There were Moneygram receipts showing that the sponsor had transferred
    money to the appellant in Pakistan.  And there were pages of  telephone
    records, said to show contact between the appellant and the sponsor  in
    Pakistan.

14. Mr Sharif claims that this material - which was at the  very  forefront
    of the appellant's case - was overlooked by the judge.  In  respect  of
    the affidavits from those in Pakistan, his submission is clearly wrong.
     The judge demonstrably (if briefly) took those affidavits into account
    at [21] and came to the conclusion that they did not add  significantly
    to the evidence in support of the relationship.  Some  might  not  have
    come to the same conclusion, but that does not establish a legal  error
    on the part of the judge.

15. In respect of the financial  remittances  and  the  telephone  records,
    however, there is no direct engagement by the judge with that evidence.
     There is reference to what the ECO made of the evidence at [7].  There
    is reference to what Judge Fox had made of similar  evidence  at  [14].
    There is reference to the appellant's affidavit, in which she relied on
    the ongoing financial support and contact, at [15].  At no point in the
    judge's decision, however, did he engage with  the  evidence  that  the
    sponsor has continued to send money to  Pakistan,  with  the  appellant
    named as the recipient, or that he has continued to make a large number
    of telephone calls to Pakistan.

16. In respect of the Moneygram receipts in particular, I consider that the
    judge erred in law in failing to consider or engage with this important
    evidence.  As Mr Sharif noted in his oral submissions, there were  many
    Moneygram receipts before  the  judge.   These  receipts  were  in  two
    batches.  The first batch was dated between June 2016  and  April  2019
    and was in the bundle submitted with the notice of appeal on  17  April
    2019.  The second batch was at pp26-31 of the appellant's bundle, dated
    between May and September 2019.  The total amount of money remitted was
    - by my rough calculation - something in order of �16,000.

17. The fact that the sponsor has been remitting such sums to the appellant
    (who is named as the recipient  in  the  later  slips)  was  clearly  a
    material matter for the FtT to consider.  I do not accept  either  that
    the judge came to grips with that evidence or that he  gave  sufficient
    reasons for discounting it in his analysis of the relationship which is
    said to exist between the appellant and the sponsor.  This was critical
    evidence of what was said to be a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
    and it was incumbent on the judge to say what he made of  it.   He  did
    not do so, and his decision cannot stand as a result.

18. The Lebara call records are evidentially less significant, to my  mind,
    given that the appellant is not named as the recipient  of  the  calls.
    That is not a criticism  of  anybody,  least  of  all  the  appellant's
    solicitors, since that is  the  nature  of  the  records  in  question.
    Nevertheless, the fact remains that this elderly widow, whose  children
    all reside in the United Kingdom, has clearly made a significant number
    of calls to Pakistan over the relevant period.   They  might  not  have
    been to the appellant but they are certainly said to have been, and  it
    was for the judge to engage with that evidence and  to  state  what  he
    made of it.  Again, he failed to do so and his failure in that  respect
    adds to the concern which I have expressed in  relation  to  the  money
    remittance slips.

19. Mr Sharif's final point is also made out.  In its final iteration,  the
    complaint was that the judge had failed to bear  in  mind  the  country
    conditions when he (like Judge Fox) had attached  significance  to  the
    appellant's decision to return to her parents' house before the sponsor
    departed for the UK.  My initial reaction to the point was that it  had
    been open to the judge to be concerned about this but, on reflection, I
    consider that it was incumbent upon the judge to consider  the  country
    conditions before he reached that finding.  This was not  a  protection
    appeal but the principles explained in cases such as Y  v  SSHD  [2006]
    EWCA Civ 1223 nevertheless applied to a finding of this nature.

20. As Mr Sharif pointed out before me, the judge seems to have  overlooked
    the danger to which a lone female  might  be  exposed  in  Pakistan  in
    coming to this finding (SM (lone women  -  ostracism)  Pakistan  [2016]
    UKUT 67 (IAC) refers).  It  seems  to  me  that  much  depends  on  the
    surrounding circumstances: the distance that  the  appellant  would  be
    required to travel to return to her parents' home, the amount  of  time
    between the appellant's return and the sponsor's departure, and so  on.
    None of this was taken into account by the judge, however, who  adopted
    Judge Fox' concern without any further reflection on the point.

21. On any view, there are serious difficulties faced by the  appellant  in
    this appeal.  On the limited medical evidence before him, the judge was
    undoubtedly entitled to wonder why the  sponsor  had  not  returned  to
    Pakistan since 2016.  And it is not a simple matter  -  even  with  the
    benefit of the bank statements which appear in the appellant's bundle -
    to understand how the sponsor, who is a pensioner,  has  been  able  to
    remit such significant sums to the appellant in Pakistan. Be that as it
    may, I am entirely satisfied that the judge erred in law in failing  to
    consider the matters I have set out above and I am not able to say with
    any degree of certainty that the result would have been the same if the
    judge's enquiry had been properly holistic.

22. In the circumstances, I will set aside the judge's decision  and  remit
    the  matter  to  the  FtT  for  consideration  afresh.   That  is   the
    appropriate course where none of the judge's findings can stand and the
    matter needs to be revisited de novo.
