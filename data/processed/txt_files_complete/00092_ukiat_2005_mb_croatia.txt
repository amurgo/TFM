                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


  1. This is  an  appeal  against  the  determination  of  an  Adjudicator,
     Professor A Grubb, promulgated on 14 April  2004.   He  dismissed  the
     Appellant's appeal against the refusal by the Secretary  of  State  of
     leave to enter the United Kingdom on asylum grounds, and  the  refusal
     of the claim to remain on Articles 2 and 3 ECHR grounds.

  2. For the reasons we come to, this appeal is dismissed.  We consider  it
     appropriate to say that this is a model determination.   Save  for  an
     immaterial error of law induced by the Tribunal through  M*  (Croatia)
     [2004] UKIAT 00024 and by earlier Court of Appeal decisions, as  later
     exposed by Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, [2004] Imm  AR  381,  and  by  Huang
     [2005] EWCA Civ 105, it could be studied, and emulated with  advantage
     with the availability of time, by all working judicially in this area.

  3. The Appellant is a citizen of Croatia of Serbian ethnicity  born  near
     Vukovar in Eastern Slavonia, Croatia, in 1978.  He left  Croatia  with
     his fianc�e, now his wife, on 23 September 1999 and he claimed  asylum
     in the United Kingdom on the same day.  His wife  now  claims  as  his
     dependant.  The basis of his claim was his fear of discrimination  and
     physical violence from Croatians  and  that  he  would  be  forced  to
     undertake military service in the Croatian Army  to  which  he  had  a
     conscientious objection.  The Appellant was not interviewed  until  16
     December 2003, over four years later.   The  refusal  letter  followed
     quite swiftly.

  4. The Adjudicator considered the current position of Serbs from  Croatia
     in the light of a number of guiding IAT decisions and  concluded  that
     there were no general or specific circumstances which meant  that  the
     return of the Appellant to Croatia would breach the Refugee Convention
     or Article 3 ECHR.  He then  rejected  the  separate  claim  that  his
     objection to military service gave  him  a  basis  for  asylum  or  an
     Article 3 claim.

  5.  The  Adjudicator  next  considered  Article  8,  accepting  that  the
     Appellant had established an extant private and  family  life  in  the
     United Kingdom.  There would be some change in the quality  of  family
     life on return to Croatia and said:

           "89.  There is, in my judgment, no insuperable obstacle  to  the
                 Appellant and his family returning to their home village in
                 Croatia  and  maintaining  their   existing   family   life
                 together.  There would, of course, be some  change  in  the
                 quality of their family life  given  the  different  social
                 circumstances that exist here and in Croatia.  There  would
                 also be some interference with aspects of  the  Appellant's
                 private life in respect of his work and friendships.  I  do
                 not, however, regard those as significant enough to  amount
                 to an interference with his Article 8 right.


           90.   Taking all these matters into account, I am not  satisfied
                 that the Appellant's  right  under  Article  8.1  would  be
                 engaged by his return to Croatia.  However, in  case  I  am
                 wrong in taking that view, I go on to consider whether  any
                 interference is justified under Article 8.2"

  6. In the light of the then state of the law, the  Adjudicator  correctly
     directed himself in accordance with Edore v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ  716,
     [2003] INLR 361, Djali v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 1371 and  M*  (Croatia).
     To him the crucial aspect was the delay in the  Secretary  of  State's
     decision-making.  He said:

           "97.  I have already set out the evidence, which I accept, about
                 the Appellant's situation in the UK and that which  he  and
                 his family will face on return to Croatia.  I refer to  and
                 adopt the material at paragraphs [60]-[61], [84] and  [86]-
                 [87].  I do not regard  his  return  to  Croatia  with  his
                 family  to  entail  insuperable  obstacles,   despite   the
                 difficulties that they will surely face.   They  have  been
                 here 4� years and to their credit, they have 'got  on  with
                 life' and made a go of things:  studying,  working,  making
                 friends and, most recently, deciding to have a  baby  which
                 is due next month.  They are not, so far  as  I  can  tell,
                 anything other than good citizens and are not  a  drain  on
                 the public purse.   The  Appellant's  'private  and  family
                 life' in the UK has arisen  at  a  time  when  he  and,  of
                 course,  his  wife  were  aware  that  their   status   was
                 uncertain.  It seems to me that apart  from  the  issue  of
                 delay - the  so-called  'Shala  point'  -  the  Appellant's
                 removal to his own country  from  which  he  and  his  wife
                 originate, in the  circumstances  that  I  have  previously
                 rehearsed, would not be disproportionate in furtherance  of
                 maintaining an effective and fair immigration policy.   The
                 crucial issue is, in my judgment, that of delay."

  7. The Adjudicator then referred to various decisions on  delay,  notably
     Shala v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 233,  [2003]  INLR  349,  J  (Serbia  and
     Montenegro) [2004] UKIAT 00016, and M* (Croatia), where Shala and  the
     facts concerning Home Office Bulletins 2/99 and 4/99 were  considered.
     The Appellant in M* (Croatia) had arrived at almost the same  time  as
     this  Appellant.   The  Tribunal  there,  and  the  Adjudicator  here,
     concluded that it could not say that there was a good  prospect  of  a
     favourable decision from the Secretary of State  within  a  reasonable
     time of the Appellant's entry into the  United  Kingdom  in  September
     1999.  There was no particular advantage which the Appellant had  been
     denied as a result of the delay  in  making  a  decision,  unlike  the
     position in Shala  where  a  reasonably  prompt  decision  would  have
     enabled him to make an in-country marriage application.

  8. Nonetheless, the Adjudicator correctly did  not  treat  the  delay  in
     decision-making as irrelevant.  He said:

           "111.  Context  here  is  everything.   The  Appellant  has  not
                 suffered any specific detriment by the delay.   Indeed,  it
                 could be argued that he has had an opportunity  to  develop
                 his relationship with his (now) wife and to gain experience
                 at work and in the  English  language.   He  has,  in  that
                 sense, gained  from  the  delay  when  otherwise  he  might
                 already have been returned to Croatia.  I  also  note,  and
                 gratefully adopt, the Tribunal's observation in J that over
                 the relevant period to that case, and to this appeal, it is
                 well recognised that the Home Office has had to  process  a
                 'high   volume   of   asylum   applications'.    In   these
                 circumstances, I do not consider the  delay  in  processing
                 this Appellant's claim to be excessive and to be a decisive
                 factor in determining  whether  the  Secretary  of  State's
                 decision  is  a  disproportionate  interference  with   the
                 Appellant's right to 'private and family life'.


           112.  In my judgment, taking account of all the circumstances of
                 the Appellant and his family both in the UK and  on  return
                 to Croatia, the decision is not disproportionate bearing in
                 mind the area of discretion reposed  in  the  Secretary  of
                 State.  It is not outwith the range of reasonable decisions
                 that he could make."

  9. The grounds of appeal contended first that the Adjudicator  had  erred
     in finding that there would be no interference  with  the  Appellant's
     rights under Article 8(1) and  that  he  erred  in  finding  that  the
     Appellant's rights were not engaged.  The second point was that  there
     were  circumstances  in  which  delay  in  decision-making  could   be
     determinative of proportionality issues:  the 1998 White Paper allowed
     some whose decisions had not been dealt with in two years seven months
     to qualify for exceptional leave to remain.  It hoped  that  by  April
     2001, decisions would be made within two months of receipt.   Pre-July
     1993 applications, if not decided  by  1998,  would  normally  attract
     indefinite leave to remain.   For  lesser  delays,  that  would  be  a
     factor.   This  case  fell  between  the   "determinative"   and   the
     "presumptive".  It was wrong for the  Adjudicator  not  to  treat  the
     delay as determinative and even more so for it  to  be  treated  as  a
     windfall benefit for the Appellant.  There  were  parallels  with  the
     October 2000 family "amnesty" or backlog clearance exercise.

 10. The IAT refused permission to appeal, but the Appellant contended that
     there were similarities with Shala including a written policy in force
     at the time of entry, which was said to  be  the  May  1999  Bulletin,
     which it was said  contained  the  words  that  there  was  a  general
     presumption that Serbs from Eastern Slavonia, and certain other  areas
     of Croatia, "will be able to substantiate a claim  to  asylum  on  the
     grounds of their  ethnicity".   The  Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in
     Janjanin v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 448, which had considered the  wording
     and effect of the various Bulletins issued by the Secretary  of  State
     in 1999 about Serbs from Croatia resulted from its being misled  about
     the wording of the Bulletin of May 1999.  Those arguments  were  being
     brought back before the Court of Appeal.  It was also  suggested  that
     Janjanin had left open the question of a "quasi-Shala" argument  based
     on delay.

 11. Statutory Review was granted, reversing the IAT's decision.  Two bases
     were given.  The first was that the Tribunal had failed adequately  to
     address the issues which we have set out as the  first  contention  in
     the appeal;  this was said to have a real prospect  of  success.   The
     second was that it was possible that the Shala/Janjanin  point  needed
     consideration  but  more  importantly  these   arguments   should   be
     considered  after  the  Court  of  Appeal's   consideration   of   the
     proportionality issue in Huang.

 12. The judge, Munby J, added and  we  note  the  comments  for  they  are
     important to the way in which the case was prepared before the IAT:

           "4.   It is a matter of considerable  concern  to  me  that  the
                 Bundle  lodged  with  the  AC  contains  neither  (i)   the
                 correspondence with the Home Office referred to in  para  6
                 of the Grounds for Statutory Review nor (ii) copies of  any
                 of the key authorities nor (iii) any  materials  to  enable
                 the AC to see precisely what the facts and  issues  are  in
                 the various cases dealt with by Laws LJ on 13 August  2004.
                 This places the AC in an almost impossible position.  (This
                 is not the first time that criticism has  had  to  be  made
                 about the handling of this  case:   see  para  103  of  the
                 Adjudicator's Determination.)


           5.    These deficiencies  must  be  remedied  in  time  for  the
                 hearing of the appeal before the Tribunal."

 13. We can deal shortly with the first ground of  appeal,  for  there  was
     little elaboration in argument.  The Adjudicator's reasoning is  clear
     and correct;  the first ground of appeal was based on a misreading  of
     what he said.  He had carefully set out  the  circumstances  to  which
     they would return in Croatia (paragraph 89) and concluded,  and  there
     is no challenge to it, that they would return as  a  family  to  their
     home village, maintaining their family together.  He  then  considered
     the Appellant's private life, recognising that it existed and that  it
     would  be  interfered  with.   But  that  interference  would  not  be
     significant enough to amount to a contravention of Article 8(1), which
     then would require justification.  It is well known that  interference
     has  to  reach  a  degree  of  significance  to  constitute   such   a
     contravention.  The  context  of  the  private  life  is  set  out  in
     paragraph 85, but although that work and those friendships  could  not
     continue in Croatia, paragraph 60 points  out  that  other  work  and,
     implicitly the sort of friendships which  work  and  residence  bring,
     would be available in Croatia.  There was nothing of such significance
     that removal would constitute an interference with  private  life  for
     the purposes of Article 8(1).  This ground of challenge raised  before
     the IAT on the permission application does not  appear  to  have  been
     pursued on Statutory Review, although it was a part of  the  reasoning
     for the grant of Statutory Review.

 14. In any event, the Adjudicator considered the position  were  he  wrong
     about that.  And for the reasons we come to, the error of law he  made
     in his approach to proportionality could not affect the result of  the
     appeal.

 15. We turn to the second point in the appeal which concerns the issue  of
     whether some argument based on Shala could be raised on the basis that
     the Appellant, when he entered the United Kingdom in  September  1999,
     had a legitimate claim to international protection as a refugee.  This
     argument appeared to have been closed by the decision of the Court  of
     Appeal, post Shala, in Janjanin [2004] ECWCA Civ 448, which considered
     the effect of the various Bulletins issued by the Secretary  of  State
     in 1999.

 16. A dispute  had  subsequently  arisen  between  Sutovic  and  Hartigan,
     solicitors who act for many Croatian Serbs, and the Treasury Solicitor
     over whether accurate information had  been  given  to  the  Court  of
     Appeal by the Secretary  of  State  about  the  text  of  one  of  the
     Bulletins.  This was an issue which Mr Lee for the Appellant said  had
     been or was shortly to  be  considered  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
     Strabac.  We were provided with the skeleton arguments.  Mr Lee sought
     an adjournment so that we could deliberate in the light of  the  Court
     of Appeal's decision.

 17. We refused the adjournment.  It seemed to us  quite  likely  that  the
     particular issue raised by Mr Lee would not be decided by the Court of
     Appeal anyway, and we could not see from the papers that it  might  be
     relevant, let alone decisive here.  It is not unknown for adjournments
     to be sought on the basis that some case may decide an issue of  wider
     application, and if in fact it does so, for it then  to  be  contended
     that those adjourned cases are different from the "test" case or  have
     been overtaken by  events.   Indeed,  it  turned  out  here  that  the
     Bulletin issue could not affect the result.

 18. It is worth pointing out, in the light of the validity of what Munby J
     said about the absence  of  documentation  before  the  Administrative
     Court to support the Bulletin point, that the  Adjudicator  was  faced
     with an argument about the terms  of  these  Bulletins  without  being
     provided with them, although they must have  routinely  been  used  by
     Sutovic and Hartigan.  Nor was he supplied  with  the  CIPU  statement
     from Mr Carlyle used in Janjanin  which  had  been  heard  before  the
     Adjudicator's appeal in this case, though not  decided  until  a  date
     which fell between the  Adjudicator's  hearing  and  the  promulgation
     date.

 19. The Adjudicator pointed out that the absence of  evidence  about  Home
     Office policies was regrettable in view of  the  Shala  argument,  and
     made do with the description and analysis of  those  materials  in  M*
     (Croatia), a case very similar to this one in the timing of arrival in
     the United Kingdom.  Mr Lee  could  not  assist  us  as  to  why  this
     material was not before the Adjudicator.  The Tribunal, when  refusing
     permission, was no better placed, nor was Munby J in dealing with  the
     Statutory Review.  It is difficult to see how, presented with the full
     material, it could have  been  thought  an  issue  arose  which  would
     benefit the  Appellant,  which  had  not  been  fully  dealt  with  in
     Janjanin.

 20. We were taken through extensive correspondence  between  the  Treasury
     Solicitor and Sutovic and Hartigan about the state of  the  Bulletins.
     We pressed Mr Lee as to the evidence that the Appellant came from  one
     of the areas referred to in the 1999 Bulletins as  potentially  giving
     rise to favourable consideration for protection.   Eventually,  a  map
     was provided which showed that Vukovar was  within  Eastern  Slavonia.
     We pressed Mr Lee as to the answer  to  the  points  in  the  Treasury
     Solicitor's letter of 28 May 2004;  in particular  as  to  whether  he
     accepted that whatever was the true version of Bulletin  2/99  of  May
     1999, there had been a change made to  it  on  3  August  1999.   That
     change had been from  advice,  that  although  each  case  was  to  be
     determined on its merits, there was a "general presumption" that Serbs
     from  specified  war-affected  areas  of  Croatia  including   Eastern
     Slavonia "will be able to  substantiate  a  claim  to  asylum  on  the
     grounds of their ethnicity", to "may";  our underlining.  In  November
     1999, Bulletin 4/99 was issued embodying that later language;  further
     qualifications were made in 1/00.

 21. After conclusion of the argument, Mr Lee  very  properly  returned  to
     inform us  that  he  accepted  that  this  was  indeed  the  position.
     Although M* (Croatia) did not attribute to the change in language  the
     significance which Mr Lee contended for, the suggestion that,  at  the
     end of September 1999 and allowing for any reasonable  decision-making
     period, the Appellant had an expectation of  a  grant  of  asylum  was
     doomed to fail.  M* (Croatia) offered it no support and Janjanin  made
     the  position  clear  for  those  such  as  the  Appellant.   Mr   Lee
     acknowledged that by April 2000, a claim for asylum in  the  light  of
     Tudjman's death was very unlikely to succeed.

 22. Although Mr Lee sought to argue that "may" as from August  1999  still
     enabled his case to succeed, we  do  not  accept  that.   We  did  not
     attribute in M* (Croatia) the significance to the  change  in  wording
     which Mr Lee did.  And the original May 2/99 wording, if such it  was,
     was simply a not wholly accurate attempt to reflect the UNHCR February
     1998 position paper which it reported in  paragraphs  10.1  and  10.2.
     Serb Croats from  Eastern  Slavonia  "did  not  automatically  warrant
     protection en masse";  each  case  should  be  examined  individually,
     Serbs from there "may well  be  able  to  substantiate  an  individual
     claim".  The August 1999 change reflects that continuing  position  in
     more accurate language.  But an argument that  someone  "may  well  be
     able" to substantiate a claim is a very long way from an argument that
     there was anything akin to  a  policy  that  such  individuals  should
     generally be granted asylum and enter the United Kingdom with such  an
     expectation.

 23. We are not concerned, nor is this case, with the question of what  the
     May 1999 version said.

 24. We can then turn to the final issue, which persuaded Munby J to  grant
     Statutory Review for some compelling reason  other  than  an  arguable
     error of law.  This concerns what is clearly now an erroneous approach
     to  proportionality.   The  correct  approach   for   an   Adjudicator
     considering this issue, here the proportionality of  any  interference
     with private life together with delay, is set out in Huang and  others
     v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 105, especially at paragraphs 59, 60 and 62.

           "59.  ... The true position in our judgment is that the HRA  and
                 s.65(1) require the adjudicator to allow an appeal  against
                 removal or deportation brought on Article 8 grounds if, but
                 only if, he concludes that the case is  so  exceptional  on
                 its particular facts that the imperative of proportionality
                 demands   an   outcome   in    the    appellant's    favour
                 notwithstanding that he cannot succeed under the Rules.


           60.   In  such  a  case  the  adjudicator  is  not  ignoring  or
                 overriding the Rules.  On  the  contrary  it  is  a  signal
                 feature of his task that he is bound to respect the balance
                 between public interest and private  right  struck  by  the
                 Rules with Parliament's approval.  That is why he  is  only
                 entitled on  Article  8  grounds  to  favour  an  appellant
                 outside the Rules where  the  case  is  truly  exceptional.
                 This,  not  Wednesbury  or  any  revision  of   Wednesbury,
                 represents the real restriction which the  law  imposes  on
                 the scope of judgment allowed to the  adjudicator.   It  is
                 not a question of his deferring to the Secretary of State's
                 judgment of proportionality in the  individual  case.   The
                 adjudicator's decision of the question whether the case  is
                 truly exceptional is entirely his own.  He  does  defer  to
                 the Rules;  for this approach recognises that  the  balance
                 struck   by   the   Rules   will   generally   dispose   of
                 proportionality issues arising under Article 8;   but  they
                 are not exhaustive of all cases.  There will be  a  residue
                 of truly exceptional instances.   In  our  respectful  view
                 such an approach is also reflected in Lord Bingham's  words
                 in Razgar, which we have already cited:


                       'Decisions taken pursuant to the lawful operation  of
                       immigration control will be proportionate in all save
                       a small minority of exceptional  cases,  identifiable
                       only on a case by case basis.'


           62.   In summary, where in a human rights challenge the court is
                 called upon in any respect  to  judge  the  weight  or  the
                 merits of  government  policy,  it  will  in  deciding  the
                 outcome allow a margin of discretion to the  policy  maker.
                 So much is  required  by  the  democratic  principle:   the
                 principle of respect  for  the  democratic  powers  of  the
                 State.  In such a case, consistently with  its  obligations
                 under the HRA, the court's decision is more intrusive  than
                 Wednesbury, being subject to the disciplines  described  by
                 Lord Steyn in Daly.  But there are  cases,  exemplified  by
                 these appeals, in which the court or adjudicator is not  at
                 all called upon to judge policy.  In that case no  question
                 of respect for the democratic powers of the  State  arises:
                 save  in  the  sense,  again  exemplified   here   by   the
                 Immigration Rules, that prior decisions of the executive or
                 legislature may have fixed,  and  narrowed,  the  territory
                 across which  the  adjudicator's  autonomous  judgment  may
                 operate."


 25. Mr Lee submitted that all factors including policy, family and private
     life and delay in decision-making itself were all grist to  the  mill;
     conditions on return were relevant here.  The case should be  remitted
     for all the facts to be investigated.  The Tribunal could not step  in
     if significant facts were unknown.  But, if  it  were  to  do  so,  it
     should recognise  that  this  was,  or  could  be  seen  as,  a  truly
     exceptional case.

 26. He drew our attention to Mthokozisi v SSHD [2004] EWHC 2964 (Admin) in
     which Owen J held that the Secretary of State had wrongly ignored  the
     four  year  delay  in  making  a  decision  on  a  thirteen-year-old's
     application when  that  had  caused  him  not  to  be  granted  either
     exceptional leave to remain or quite possibly indefinite leave.

 27. Mr Gulvin relied in Alihajdaraj v SSHD [2004] EWCA  Civ  1084  to  say
     that there was no case in which delay of itself had been determinative
     of any proportionality issue.  It was instead necessary to look to any
     consequences which any delay might have had.  Applying Huang,  it  was
     inevitable that the Adjudicator would have come to  exactly  the  same
     conclusion.

 28. We make this observation about the effect of delay.  Delay in decision-
     making  may  cause  an  individual  to  lose  specific  advantages  or
     opportunities which  timeous  decision-making  would  have  conferred;
     Shala  is  an  example.   There,  the   procedural   requirements   of
     immigration  control  were  invoked   disproportionately   where   the
     individual was only made subject to those requirements because of very
     substantial decision-making delays.  It was not a case in which he had
     no  substantive  merits  to  his  claim  and  no  sound  prospects  of
     satisfying the substantive  requirements  for  entry  clearance.   The
     effect of delay may also be to create  circumstances  eg  marriage  or
     parenthood, which strengthen an individual's claim to a family life or
     to a private life through work, friendships, community ties, the  need
     for medical treatment and a host of other considerations.  But in each
     such case it is the effect  of  delay  which  assists  the  claimant's
     proportionality argument.  It is very difficult to envisage a case  in
     which the removal of someone who had no claim to enter  and  no  claim
     for international protection would be disproportionate merely  because
     of a delay in decision-making, which had had  no  disadvantage  as  in
     Shala or which had not led to  the  creation  of  circumstances  which
     themselves made removal disproportionate.  It is the effects of  delay
     to which an Adjudicator should look rather than to the fact or  extent
     of delay itself.   Delay  by  itself  would  be  not  so  much  rarely
     determinative as rarely ever significant.

 29. What we  draw  from  Huang  about  the  approach  of  Adjudicators  to
     proportionality is as follows.  The Immigration Rules are the starting
     point for the assessment.  If an individual has no  substantive  claim
     within the  Rules,  it  will  be  a  truly  exceptional  case  on  its
     particular facts, in which an Adjudicator could lawfully conclude that
     removal was disproportionate.  If  an  individual  falls  outside  the
     Rules only for procedural reasons, the same applies save  that  as  in
     Shala, it is more difficult to insist on procedural requirements where
     the need for compliance has arisen because of procedural  failings  by
     the Secretary of State.  An example of exceptional  circumstances  may
     be where the procedural requirements could not be  complied  with  for
     want of accessible relevant diplomatic facilities in  the  country  of
     return.

 30. In holding that the Immigration  Rules  are  to  be  regarded  as  the
     proportionate response of the executive, approved  by  Parliament,  to
     the many and varied circumstances which individual  immigration  cases
     present, the Court of Appeal must also have had regard to the  way  in
     which those Rules are also supplemented by policies or extra-statutory
     concessions.  Where an individual may fall within  such  policies  but
     they have not been considered by the Secretary of State, the  decision
     may be unlawful, because a relevant consideration  has  been  ignored,
     though it is not for the Adjudicator directly  to  apply  the  policy.
     Such a policy offers a further guide as to what is  the  proportionate
     response of the executive:  if provision has been made through  policy
     or concession for a further class of cases, it will be  yet  the  more
     difficult for an Adjudicator to hold a decision disproportionate which
     falls outside the scope of the Rules and any policy concession.

 31. This was foreshadowed in relation to entry clearance, in cases such as
     SS (Malaysia) [2004] UKIAT 00091, paragraphs 30-32.  We  mention  that
     to point out that paragraph 31 needs to be qualified because it refers
     in part to the reasonableness approach now overruled by Huang.

 32.  Where  a  Rule  or  extra-statutory  provision  covers  the  sort  of
     circumstance upon which an individual relies eg  entry  for  marriage,
     study,  medical  treatment  or  delayed   decision-making,   but   the
     individual falls outside the specific requirements or  limits  of  the
     otherwise applicable Rules or policy, that is a very clear  indication
     that removal is proportionate.  It is not for the  judicial  decision-
     maker, except in the clear and truly exceptional case to set aside the
     limitations set by the executive, accountable to Parliament,  and,  in
     the case of the Immigration Rules, approved by Parliament.

 33. Where Rules or extra-statutory provisions do not make provision at all
     for circumstances which an individual may rely on for the purposes  of
     overcoming to the qualification to an ECHR right which is provided  by
     the legitimate interests  of  immigration  control,  his  case  cannot
     rationally be considered more favourably than one whose  circumstances
     are covered in principle by some provision of the Rules or of an extra-
     statutory policy but whose circumstances  do  not  meet  the  detailed
     requirements of the Rules or policy.

 34. The starting point for the consideration  of  proportionality  is  the
     Rules and then the effect of extra-statutory  policies.   It  will  be
     necessary in each case where an exception is made  in  respect  of  an
     individual who has no basis to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom
     to state clearly why those approved and qualified  provisions  in  the
     Rules or policies should not be regarded as  the  conclusive  negative
     answer to that claim.

 35. Compassionate circumstances are often  invoked  in  Article  8  cases,
     though they may involve in reality no significant aspect of family  or
     private life.  A removal decision may be harsh.  There are  Rules  and
     policies which deal with a variety of compassionate circumstances  for
     entry or remaining in the United Kingdom.  If a particular  case  does
     not fall within them,  the  normal  conclusion  of  an  assessment  of
     proportionality should be  that  those  circumstances  mean  that  the
     legitimate interests of immigration control favour removal.   A  truly
     exceptional case would have to be  made  out.   Article  8  is  not  a
     general provision justifying the overriding of immigration control  on
     general compassionate grounds or where  there  may  be  harshness  and
     misfortune from removal.  It is a provision which  creates  rights  on
     specific grounds and only applies where those rights exist;   it  only
     precludes the effectiveness of immigration control, as embodied in the
     Rules  and  extra-statutory  policies  or   concessions,   where   the
     individual circumstances are so powerful and  exceptional  that  those
     considered provisions should not be allowed  the  effect  which  would
     normally be accorded to them.

 36. Shala and Edore [2003] INLR 361 continue on their facts  to  exemplify
     what can constitute a truly exceptional case.  By contrast, the actual
     facts of Huang and Kashmin exemplify what cannot be such a  case,  and
     Abu-Qulbain illustrates what possibly might be such a case.  Huang and
     Kashmin also illustrate Adjudicator decisions in which  seemingly  the
     Adjudicators simply thought that the proportionality issue involved  a
     question of harshness or unfairness, which  is  a  misguided  view  of
     Article 8.  Those factors may assist a claim but cannot  be  its  sole
     content.

 37. Although Huang has held that, following Razgar in the House of  Lords,
     the M* (Croatia) reasonableness approach is wrong in law, it would  be
     a complete misinterpretation of Huang to  read  it  as  containing  an
     approach significantly different in its likely effect on the result in
     individual cases.  Read with Razgar in the House of Lords, it  clearly
     envisages successful disproportionality cases  under  Article  8,  for
     those who fall outside  the  Rules  or  policies,  as  rare  or  truly
     exceptional.  We do not see the difference in legal approach as likely
     to lead to a different answer in practice, and it is  far  from  clear
     that any difference which might exist would favour the claimant.

 38. On the facts of this case, it could not do so.  The application of the
     correct legal approach could not possibly  have  led  to  a  different
     outcome.  There is nothing comparable to Shala or  Edore.   It  is  at
     least as weak a case as Huang's or Kashmin's.  It  amounts  to  little
     more than an insignificant  interference  with  modest  components  of
     private life, allied to an unduly delayed decision.  The Appellant had
     no other claim to stay,  no  claim  within  the  Rules  or  under  any
     concession.  Even at its highest, it was no more than a possible claim
     for refugee status on arrival and there was no  policy  which  was  in
     force saying that he should have been accepted as a refugee.   He  has
     suffered no real detriment through delay other  than  uncertainty  and
     has been able to take advantage of his time here in other respects.

 39. This appeal is dismissed.  It is reported for what we  say  about  the
     Bulletins and Huang.
