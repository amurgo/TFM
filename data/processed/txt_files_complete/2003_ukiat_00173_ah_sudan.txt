                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a female citizen  of  Sudan,  born  on  5  June  1971,
      appeals against the determination of an Adjudicator (Mr  J  C  Grant-
      Hutchinson) who, in  a  determination  promulgated  on  15  May  2003
      dismissed her appeal on asylum grounds, but  allowed  her  appeal  on
      human rights grounds, against the decision of the Secretary of State,
      dated 7 November 2001, refusing her application for asylum.

2.    The appellant was represented by Ms K Cronin, of Counsel,  instructed
      by Deighton Guedalla, Solicitors, while Ms  J  Bracken,  Home  Office
      Presenting Officer, represented the Secretary of State.

3.    The grounds of appeal challenge the determination of the Adjudicator,
      claiming that the Adjudicator had erred in law on a number of  points
      and that her reasons were erroneous and unreasonable and that in  the
      light of the legal errors claimed  to  have  been  committed  by  the
      Adjudicator, the appeal against the refusal of asylum  stood  a  real
      chance of success.

4.    Leave to appeal to the Tribunal was granted by the Tribunal (HH Judge
      N Ainley) on 2 July 2003, which decision was promulgated on  29  July
      2003.

5.    When the appeal opened before the Tribunal on 3 December 2003,  Ms  J
      Bracken, on behalf of the Secretary  of  State,  submitted  that  the
      appellant's appeal should be treated as abandoned, in  the  light  of
      the terms of Section 58(9) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

6.    Ms Bracken's contention was that, as the appellant had  been  granted
      leave to remain in the United Kingdom, from 16 July 2003 to  16  July
      2006, her appeal, which was  pending  on  16  July  2003,  under  the
      provisions of Section 58(9) of the Immigration Asylum  Act  1993,  it
      must be treated as abandoned.

7.    Ms Cronin, in reply,  submitted  that,  while  what  Ms  Bracken  had
      submitted was, in general, the situation, the fact that the Tribunal,
      by the grant of leave to appeal  against  the  determination  of  the
      Adjudicator, on 2 July  2003,  which  should  be  considered  as  the
      operative date,  and not the date of promulgation, 29 July 2003,  had
      brought about an "event" after 1 April 2003, which, in  view  of  the
      definition of an "event" in paragraph  4(3)(b)  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Commencement No 4) Order  2003,  and
      any provisions of the 2002 Act, referring to those sections, as  well
      as  subordinate  legislation,  applied  to  the  appeal  before   the
      Tribunal.

8.    Her submission was, that, in view of the fact that  leave  to  appeal
      had been granted, after 1 April 2003, before the grant  of  leave  to
      remain on humanitarian grounds had been granted, on 16 July 2003,  in
      view  of  the  fact  that,  whereas  under  Section  104(4)  of   the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, an appeal was likely to
      be treated as abandoned if the appellant is granted leave  to  remain
      in the United Kingdom, such an appeal came under Section 82(1) of the
      2002 Act, but, as Section 82(1) makes  clear  that  that  section  is
      directed to appeals to Adjudicators, and as  the  appellant's  appeal
      was no longer an appeal to an Adjudicator, but was an appeal  to  the
      Tribunal, it was not caught by the operation of Section 104(4) of the
      2002 Act, and that the appellant's appeal should not  be  treated  as
      abandoned.

9.    She submitted that, if, on 16 July 2003, leave had not  been  granted
      to  the  appellant,  it  would  still  have  been  an  appeal  to  an
      Adjudicator and would fall to be treated as abandoned, but that, once
      it became a Tribunal  appeal,  it  could  no  longer  be  treated  as
      abandoned, and that the Secretary of State's motion for the appeal to
      be treated as abandoned must fail.

10.   We heard Ms Bracken, in reply, and she  submitted  that  Ms  Cronin's
      argument failed, in that Section 58(9) of the 1999  Act  was  carried
      over by the (Commencement  No  4)  Order  2003  and  that,  in  those
      circumstances, the appeal,  being  pending  under  the  old  appeal's
      provisions, is to be treated as abandoned.

11.   We then considered all the submissions made to us on this  particular
      aspect, and announced in open court, that  the  objection  raised  on
      behalf of the Secretary of State succeeded and that the appeal of the
      appellant must be treated as abandoned.  We stated that we would give
      our reasons in writing at a later date.

12.   The reasons for allowing the Secretary of State's application for the
      appeal to be treated as abandoned are as follows:

13.   The appellant, on 19 November 2001, filed notice  of  appeal  against
      the refusal of the Secretary of  State  to  grant  her  asylum  under
      Section 69(2) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  Her appeal was
      heard by an  Adjudicator  on  28  April  2003,  and  dismissed  in  a
      determination, promulgated on 15 May 2003.

14.   The appellant's representatives then filed an application  for  leave
      to appeal against the determination of 15 May 2003, on 26  May  2003.
      However, an application was granted by the Tribunal, on 2 July  2003,
      and that decision was promulgated on 29 July 2003.  In the  meantime,
      the Secretary of State,  on  16  July  2003,  granted  the  appellant
      humanitarian protection leave to remain in the United Kingdom  on  16
      July 2003.

15.   When the appeal, filed on 26 May 2003, came on for hearing before the
      Tribunal, on 3 December 2003, Ms Bracken, the Home Office  Presenting
      Officer, submitted that, as the appeal of the appellant was  pending,
      the provisions of Section 58(9)  of  the  1999  Act,  applied,  which
      Section appeared in Part (iv) of the 1999 Act, which part of the  Act
      continued to have effect, in relation to events which had taken place
      before 1 April 2003, when the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
      2003 came into force, and that that being so, the  appellant,  having
      been granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom, her appeal is  to
      be treated as abandoned.

16.   Ms Cronin's submissions, in reply, are, as set out  in  her  Skeleton
      Argument, which read as follows:

      "8.   It is the Appellant's case that the Tribunal's grant  of  leave
           to appeal, as a decision made in this case, was an 'event' after
           1 April 2003 as defined by paragraph 4(3)(b) of the  nationality
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Commencement No 4) Order  2003.
           This has the effect that from the 'event' (the leave decision on
           2 July 2003), sections 82-99 and 101-103 and  any  provision  of
           the 2002 Act referring to those sections as well as  subordinate
           legislation applied thereafter to this case.

      9.    Pursuant to Section 104(4)  of  the  2002  Act,  an  appeal  is
           likewise to be treated as abandoned if the appellant is  granted
           leave to enter or remain in the  UK.   The  appeal  in  question
           concerns the appeal under Section 82(1)  of  the  Act.   As  the
           terms of Section 82(1) make clear, that section is  directed  to
           appeals to Adjudicators.  It is the Appellant's  case  that  any
           ouster provision is to be strictly construed, and  that  in  the
           circumstances of this  case  where  leave  to  appeal  had  been
           granted, that  as  on  16  July,  when  humanitarian  leave  was
           granted, the Appellant's appeal was no  longer  an  Adjudicator,
           but a Tribunal appeal and therefore not caught by the  operation
           of section 104(4).  It follows that if on the 16 July 2003, that
           Appellant's case has not been granted leave, it would then  have
           been  an  Adjudicator  appeal  and  it  would  be  taken  to  be
           abandoned.  The Appellant submits that the appeal is extant, and
           that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine this appeal."

17.   Having considered all  the  points  raised,  argued  before  us,  the
      situation, as we see it, is as follows.

18.   The appellant's appeal was commenced under the provisions of the 1999
      Act, and continued after the 2002 Act  commenced  on  1  April  2003,
      culminating in the dismissal of the  appellant's  appeal  on  15  May
      2003.   The provisions of the 2002 Act came into  force  on  1  April
      2003, but, by virtue of the 2002 Act (Commencement No 4) Order  2003,
      paragraph 3(1) of which, reads as follows:

      "Subject to Schedule 2, the new appeal provisions  are  not  to  have
      effect in relation to events which took place  before  1  April  2003
      and, notwithstanding their repeal by the provisions of the  2002  Act
      commenced by this Order, the old appeals provisions are  to  continue
      to have effect in relation to such events",

      the provisions of the 1999 Act continue to have effect in relation to
      her appeal.

19.   This is clear also from paragraph 4 of the Commencement  No  4  Order
      2003 where, at sub-section (b)(iv) it is stated that the "old appeals
      provisions" includes part (iv) of the 1999 Act, and, at sub-paragraph
      (c), it is stated that the "Old Immigration Act" means,  among  other
      Acts, the 1999 Act.

20.   Further, although paragraph 3(1) sets out  the  general  transitional
      provisions, it is by virtue of  paragraph 3(2), subject  to  Schedule
      2.   However,  while  Schedule  2  sets  out   certain   transitional
      provisions rating to the 2002 Act, none of these provisions adversely
      affects the generality  paragraph 3(1) as it applies  to  the  matter
      before the Tribunal in this appeal.

21.   Thus, the application by the appellant, on 26 May 2003, for leave  to
      appeal against the determination of the  Adjudicator,  although  made
      after  1  April  2003,  was  made  under  the  1999  Act,   and   the
      determination of that application by the Tribunal, on 2 July 2003 and
      promulgated on 29 July 2003, was done under  the  provisions  of  the
      1999  Act.    Further,  under  the  1999  Act,  Section  58(5),   the
      appellant's appeal was still pending.

22.   Thus, although the 2002 Act came into force on 1 April 2003, and  the
      new appeals provisions, which means Sections 82-99 and Sections  101-
      103 of the 2002 Act, also came into  force  those  sections  did  not
      apply to the appellant's appeal as, by virtue of paragraph 3  of  the
      (Commencement No 4) Order 2003, the provisions of  Section  58(9)  of
      the 1999 Act, still applied, under which section and sub-section, the
      appeal of the appellant she having been granted leave  to  remain  in
      the United Kingdom, is to be considered as abandoned.

23.   Accordingly, Ms Cronin's submissions that the grant of leave  by  the
      Tribunal on 2 July 2003 and promulgated on 29 July 2003,  constituted
      an event which brought Sections 82-99 and  Sections  101-103  of  the
      2002 Act, into effect, fails.

24.   Therefore, for the above reasons, we  upheld  the  submission  of  Ms
      Bracken and treated the appellant's appeal as abandoned.

25.   We would just add, that had Ms Cronin's submission that  the   appeal
      should not be treated as abandoned, had been successful, we would, in
      all probability, have found in her favour based on the other  grounds
      of appeal lodged by her, and  on  which  leave  to  appeal  had  been
      granted.

26.   However, as the appellant's appeal is  being  treated  as  abandoned,
      those considerations do not apply.
