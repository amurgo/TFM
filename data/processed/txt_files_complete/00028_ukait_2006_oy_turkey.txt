The standstill clause in Article 6 of Association Council Decision  80/1  is
concerned solely with the conditions relating to  the  worker's  "access  to
employment" in the UK.  It is not concerned with the admission to the UK  of
a Turkish worker or his family.  Consequently, the admission to  the  UK  of
the family of a Turkish worker is to be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the
relevant immigration rule (and any policies) in effect at the  date  of  the
entry clearance decision.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

  1. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on  20  June  1984.   On  20
     January 2004, together with his mother and 3 siblings, he applied  for
     entry clearance to  join  his  father,  a  Turkish  national  who  was
     employed in the  United  Kingdom.   It  seems  that  his  family  were
     successful but the appellant's application was refused  by  the  Entry
     Clearance Officer on that date.  His appeal to an Adjudicator, Mr P  J
     Robinson, was dismissed in a determination promulgated on 16  November
     2004.   The  appellant  was  granted  permission  to  appeal  to   the
     Immigration Appeal Tribunal in January 2005 and that grant  now  takes
     effect  as  an  order  for  reconsideration  before  the  Asylum   and
     Immigration Tribunal under the Asylum and  Immigration  (Treatment  of
     Claimants,  etc)  Act  2004  (Commencement  No  5   and   Transitional
     Provisions) Order 2005, SI 2005/565, restricted,  by  virtue  of  rule
     62(7) of the Procedure Rules, to the  grounds  upon  which  leave  was
     granted.

     The background

  2. The appellant's father left Turkey and his family sometime in 1995 and
     came to the UK where he claimed asylum.   Although  the  Secretary  of
     State rejected his application, on 20 July 1999 he was  granted  leave
     to enter until 25 May 2003 and then on 15  May  2003  he  was  granted
     indefinite  leave  to  remain.    Evidence  was  produced  before  the
     Adjudicator, which is not disputed, that the appellant's father  is  a
     full-time kebab chef  in  a  restaurant  in  Colchester.   It  is  not
     entirely clear from the evidence when he began work  in  the  UK.   Mr
     Walsh, who appeared for the appellant, told us it was sometime in 2003
     after he obtained indefinite leave to remain.  Amongst  the  documents
     before the Adjudicator is a  document  from  his  employers  recording
     national insurance deductions made from his wages covering,  it  would
     seem, the tax year April 2003 - April 2004.  There is not, as  far  as
     we are able to see, any further evidence of his  employment  prior  to
     this.  The Adjudicator also had evidence before him  relating  to  the
     financial situation of the appellant's father and his accommodation.

  3. Mr Walsh argued unsuccessfully before the Adjudicator, and renewed the
     argument before us, that the Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  wrong  to
     consider the appellant's application to join  his  father  in  the  UK
     under  the  current  Immigration  Rules,  namely  paragraph  317   (in
     particular 317(i)(f)) of HC 395 under which it is  now  accepted  that
     the appellant could not succeed because, at the date of  decision,  he
     could  not  establish  that  he  was  "living  alone"   in  "the  most
     exceptional compassionate circumstances" in Turkey.  It was upon  that
     basis  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  initially   refused   his
     application.   Instead, Mr Walsh maintained, that  the  appellant  was
     entitled to have his  application  considered  under  the  Immigration
     Rules in force at a much earlier  date  by  virtue  of  the  EC-Turkey
     Association Agreement (September 12, 1963) and the Additional Protocol
     (November 23, 1970) (hereafter 'the Ankara Agreement')  which  applied
     to him as his father was a  Turkish  worker  in  the  UK.    Mr  Walsh
     maintained that by virtue of  the  Ankara  Agreement  and  Association
     Council Decisions 2/76 and 1/80, the appellant's application should be
     considered under paragraph 42 of  HC  509,  Statement  of  Immigration
     Rules for Control on Entry which was in force on the date of the  UK's
     accession to the EC on 1 January 1973.  The latter  Immigration  Rule,
     it was suggested, was more generous in cases  of  family  reunion,  in
     particular when applied to children who have reached the age of 18 but
     who are under 21 (as was this appellant at the date of decision).

  4. In a carefully reasoned determination,  the  adjudicator  rejected  Mr
     Walsh's argument which, as we shall see,  is  novel  and  not  without
     subtlety.   The adjudicator decided that the appellant could not  take
     advantage of the Ankara  Agreement  and,  therefore,  that  the  Entry
     Clearance Officer was  correct  to  apply  the  current  rule,  namely
     paragraph 317 of HC 395.  Mr Walsh submitted before us that this was a
     material error of law; the Entry Clearance Officer's decision was "not
     otherwise in accordance with the law" and we should allow  the  appeal
     to the extent that the appellant's  application  for  entry  clearance
     remains outstanding before the Entry Clearance Officer.

  5. We begin  by  setting  out  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Ankara
     Agreement and Association Council Decisions.

      The Ankara Agreement

  6. The Ankara Agreement is an Association Agreement entered into  between
     the EC and Turkey intended to assist and facilitate in  promoting  and
     developing trade and economic relations between the Member States  and
     Turkey with a view to the eventual accession of Turkey to the European
     Union (see R v SSHD ex p Savas  (Case  C-37/98)  [2000]  INLR  398  at
     [53]). To this end, there are  a  number  of  provisions  relating  to
     Turkish workers and those who wish to establish themselves in business
     or self-employment in  a  Member  State.   We  are,  of  course,  only
     concerned with the position of workers.

  7. In relation to workers, Article 12 of the main Agreement provides  the
     foundation for the development of free movement of Turkish workers  in
     the EU as follows:

           "The Contracting Parties agree to be guided by Articles  48,  49
           and 50 of the Treaty establishing the Community for the purposes
           of  progressively  securing  freedom  of  movement  for  workers
           between them."

  8. The reference to the EC Treaty provisions  (now  re-numbered  Articles
     39, 40 and 41 respectively) is to the free movement provisions in  the
     EC Treaty for EU national workers.

  9. Further provision towards the "progressive" securing of free  movement
     of Turkish workers is  found  in  Articles  36-40  of  the  Additional
     Protocol signed in 1970.  In particular, Article 36 provides:

           "Freedom of movement for workers between Member  States  of  the
           Community and Turkey shall be secured by progressive  stages  in
           accordance with the principles set out  in  Article  12  of  the
           Agreement of Association between the end of the twelfth and  the
           twenty-second year after entry into force of that Agreement.


           The Council of Association shall decide on the  rules  necessary
           to that end."


 10. Directly neither of these provisions assists  the  appellant  in  this
     case and Mr Walsh did not seek  to  rely  upon  them  directly.    The
     European Court of Justice in Demirel v Stadt  Schw�bisch  Gm�nd  (Case
     12/86) [1987] ECR 3719  decided  that  neither  provision  has  direct
     effect because both lack sufficient  precision  and  unconditionality.
     They do, however, give the context of the detailed rules  that  follow
     and set out the aim of progressive recognition of free movement rights
     for workers for Turkish workers in the EU in accordance with Community
     law principles.

      Association Council Decision 1/80

 11. The role of the Council of Association is crucial.  As Article  36  of
     the Additional Protocol stipulates, it is the role of the  Association
     Council to give content to the  generalised  aims  and  objectives  of
     Article 36 read with Article 12  of  the  main  Agreement.   Mr  Walsh
     relied particularly upon parts of Decision  2/76  and  Decision  1/80.
     For our purposes it suffices to set out the relevant articles  of  the
     latter decision which, from 20 December 1976, again for our  purposes,
     superseded the earlier decision.

 12. Article 6 of Decision 1/80 sets out  certain  "rights"  of  a  Turkish
     worker in the following terms:

           "1. Subject to Article  7  on  free  access  to  employment  for
           members of his family,  a  Turkish  worker  duly  registered  as
           belonging to the labour force of a Member State:
                 - shall be entitled in that Member State, after one  year's
                 legal employment, to the renewal of his permit to work  for
                 the same employer, if a job is available;
                 - shall be entitled in that Member State, after three years
                 of legal employment and subject to the priority to be given
                 to workers of Member States of the Community, to respond to
                 another offer  of  employment,  with  an  employer  of  his
                 choice, made under normal conditions  and  registered  with
                 the  employment  services  of  that  State,  for  the  same
                 occupation;
                 - shall enjoy free access in that Member State to any  paid
                 employment  of  his  choice,  after  four  years  of  legal
                 employment.


           ..."


 13. Article 7 - which had no counterpart in the earlier  Decision  2/76  -
     provides for certain rights for family members of Turkish  workers  as
     follows:

           "'The members of the family of a Turkish worker duly  registered
           as belonging to the labour force of a  Member  State,  who  have
           been authorised to join him:
                 - shall be entitled - subject to the priority to  be  given
                 to workers of Member States of the Community -  to  respond
                 to any offer of employment after  they  have  been  legally
                 resident for at least three years in that Member State;
                 - shall enjoy free access to any paid employment  of  their
                 choice provided they have been legally resident  there  for
                 at least five years.
           Children of Turkish workers  who  have  completed  a  course  of
           vocational training in the host country may respond to any offer
           of employment there, irrespective of the  length  of  time  they
           have been resident in that Member State, provided one  of  their
           parents has been legally employed in the Member State  concerned
           for at least three years. "

 14. Article 9 of Decision 1/80, which we need not set out,  also  provides
     for certain further  educational  entitlements  for  the  children  of
     Turkish workers.

 15.  Although  these  Articles  do   have   direct   effect   (Sevince   v
     Staatssecretaris van Justitie (Case C-192/89) [1990]  ECR  I-3461  and
     Kadiman v State of Bavaria (Case C-351/95) [1997] ECR I-2133),  it  is
     clear from reading them that none directly assists  the  appellant  in
     this case.  The provisions  are  limited  in  their  entitlements  for
     workers (and their families) once resident in the  UK.   For  workers,
     Article 6 is not concerned with their "first employment" in the UK but
     rather with their entitlement to remain and continue  employment  when
     already part of the workforce.   The appellant is, of  course,  not  a
     Turkish worker seeking to rely upon an entitlement to continue working
     under Article 6.  Nor is he a family member already in the UK  seeking
     to rely on the work entitlement after 3 years  residence  set  out  in
     Article 7.  Nor is he seeking to rely on the  educational  entitlement
     under Article 9.  Given the particular terms and scope of  Articles  6
     and 7, it is perhaps not surprising that the European Court of Justice
     has accepted  that  the  Ankara  Agreement,  and  Association  Council
     Decisions made under it, do not confer any entitlement upon a  Turkish
     national, whether as a prospective worker in the UK or  family  member
     seeking reunion with an existing worker, to enter the UK.  Entry is  a
     matter for the Member States' national laws (see, e.g. Kadiman v State
     of Bavaria (Case C-352/95) above and Ergat v Stadt Ulm (Case C-329/97)
     [1999] ECR I-1487).

      The standstill clause - Article 13

 16. On their own terms,  therefore,  these  provisions  in  Decision  1/80
     provide no support for the appellant's case.   Indeed,  their  precise
     terms and limited scope both in respect of workers and their families,
     if anything, militate against the appellant's more  general  claim  to
     enter on the favourable basis of earlier Immigration Rules.

 17. Mr Walsh, however, relied on Article 13 of Decision  1/80  -  the  so-
     called "standstill clause" - which is as follows:

           "The Member States of the Community and Turkey may not introduce
           new restrictions on  the  conditions  of  access  to  employment
           applicable to workers and  members  of  their  families  legally
           resident and employed in their respective territories".

 18. There is no doubt that this clause has direct effect from 20  December
     1976 (see, Sevince, above).  Equally, it is clear that the effect of a
     standstill clause is to fix in time  an  individual's  entitlement  or
     what restrictions may be imposed upon him according to the  terms  and
     scope of the particular clause so as to "prevent the Member State from
     reverting to less liberal provisions" in respect  of  that  individual
     (see Procureur de Roi v Royer (Case C-48/75) [1976] ECR 497 at  [74]).



 19. Mr Walsh accepted that Article 13 of Decision 1/80 did  not  confer  a
     right directly upon the appellant.  The enumerated right (if  that  be
     the correct description of it) is plainly that of  his  father  -  the
     worker.  Instead, Mr Walsh contented himself with submitting that  the
     appellant has a derived right from his father's to be  considered  for
     entry to the UK on no less favourable terms than when  the  standstill
     clause came into effect.  Otherwise,  he  submitted,  the  appellant's
     father would be subject to "new  restrictions  on  the  conditions  of
     access to employment" because he might feel  compelled  to  return  to
     Turkey if his family could not join him.   Mr  Walsh  submitted,  this
     meant  that  the  appellant  was  entitled  to  have  his  application
     considered on the basis of the Immigration Rules in force on 1 January
     1973 when the UK joined the EC  and  became  a  party  to  the  Ankara
     Agreement. He referred us to paragraph 42 of HC  509.   In  fact,  the
     correct date is 10 January 1976  since  this  is  the  date  that  the
     standstill clause first came  into  effect  through  Council  Decision
     2/76.  The relevant Immigration Rule is, therefore, paragraph 39 of HC
     81 which replaced HC 509 with effect from 25  January  1973.   Nothing
     is, however, affected by  this  as  the  material  terms  of  the  two
     paragraphs are identical.  Paragraph 39 provides as follows:

           "39. Generally, children  aged  18  or  over  must  qualify  for
           admission in their own right; but subject to the requirements of
           paragraphs 34 and 35, an unmarried and fully dependent son under
           21 or an unmarried daughter under 21  who  formed  part  of  the
           family unit overseas may be admitted if  the  whole  family  are
           settled  in  the  United  Kingdom  or  are  being  admitted  for
           settlement."

 20.  Paragraph  34  sets  out  the  requirement  that  the  sponsor   will
     accommodate and maintain the person seeking entry without recourse  to
     public funds.  Paragraph 35 sets out visa requirements in  respect  of
     certain nationals.

 21. Mr Walsh submitted that the appellant - who was  19  at  the  date  of
     decision - fulfilled  these  requirements  on  the  evidence:  he  was
     dependent, unmarried and, at the time his father left Turkey  in  1995
     (which, Mr Walsh said, was the correct time to consider this), he  was
     part of the family unit in Turkey because they all lived together.  Mr
     Deller took a different view on the evidence given that at the date of
     decision in January 2004, the appellant was employed in Turkey and was
     no longer living as family since his father had left Turkey  in  1995.
     A number of issues were raised about the assumption that paragraph  39
     was satisfied on the evidence.  These are, however, issues  that  only
     need to be resolved if the appellant is entitled to be judged  on  the
     earlier rule.

      Our conclusions

 22. Mr Walsh's submissions have  a  certain  beguiling  quality  to  them,
     praying in aid as they do the  well-accepted  Community  Law  approach
     when interpreting the free movement rights of EU citizens  within  the
     EU.  EU legislative provisions and the European Court of Justice  have
     consistently conferred  or  recognised  an  ancillary  right  of  free
     movement upon a close family  member  to  accompany  or  join  the  EU
     national who is exercising his or her EU right in another Member State
     (see, e.g. Council Regulation 1612/68 and Directive 68/360 -  workers'
     families; and Baumbast v SSHD (Case  C-413/99)  [2002]  ECR  I-7091  -
     parent of EU dependent child in education).  The  ancillary  right  is
     conferred in order to remove any obstacle to the exercise of the  free
     movement right of the EU national.  Frequently, the European Court  of
     Justice gains support for its approach  from  the  parties'  right  to
     respect for their private and family life protected by  Article  8  of
     the ECHR (see, e.g Carpenter v SSHD (Case C-60/00) [2002] ECR I-6279).
       So, one might ask, if so for a family member of an EU  national  who
     exercises his or her EU rights, why not also for a family member of  a
     Turkish worker taking advantage of his enforceable entitlements  under
     the Ankara Agreement?

 23. At the outset, it is important to recognise that this is  not  a  case
     about free movement of an EU national and his family  within  the  EU.
     It concerns an Association Agreement with a prospective member country
     of the EU and is a document contemplating progressive  recognition  of
     free movement rights for citizens of  that  country  without  equating
     them to those of existing EU citizens.   Whilst  the  Agreement  forms
     part of the Community's legal order, it is of a  different  nature  to
     the Treaties and other legislative  instruments  which  confer  rights
     upon EU citizens.  By their very terms, the Agreement, the  Additional
     Protocol and Council Decisions acknowledge the more limited nature  of
     the entitlements of Turkish workers and others  falling  within  their
     scope.

 24. Mr Walsh does not, as such, argue that the  appellant  has  a  derived
     right to enter the UK.  He could not do so.  It is clear, as we stated
     above, that the Ankara Agreement confers no such right on a worker or,
     by extension, any family member.  Unlike the case of EU nationals  who
     wish to bring or be joined by their family members, the European Court
     of Justice has recognised that in the case of the families of  Turkish
     workers, Member States have the right to control  and  regulate  their
     entry (see, Kadiman, Ergat and also, R v SSHD ex parte Savas (Case  C-
     37/98) above at [58]).  Indeed, the  Member  States'  control  extends
     beyond entry until Article 6 (in the case of workers) or Article 7 (in
     the case of family members) of Decision  1/80  bites.   Only  at  that
     point does the Turkish national acquire under the  Agreement,  certain
     rights  in  relation  to  access  to  employment  and,  by   necessary
     implication, residence in order to exercise those rights.   In  Ergat,
     above at [42] the European Court of Justice stated:

           "under Community law as it now stands, the  Member  States  have
           retained the power to regulate both the entry into its territory
           of a member of the family of a Turkish worker and the conditions
           of his residence during the initial three-year period before  he
           has a right to respond to any offer of employment."

 25. What Mr Walsh argues for is that the standstill clause in  Article  13
     binds, and therefore restricts, the Member States' ability to regulate
     and control entry to family members to those national rules  in  force
     on 20 December 1976.  There is no mention of this limit on the  Member
     States' powers in Ergat and, in our view, such a restriction is out of
     step  with  the  European  Court  of  Justice's  recognition  of   the
     autonomous power of the Member States in regulating entry  so  clearly
     spelt out in Ergat.

 26. Also, the appellant's claim simply does not sit well with the  express
     provisions of Decision 1/80 which, as we have seen, contains a  number
     of directly applicable provisions which  deal  specifically  with  the
     rights of family members of Turkish workers.  As we have seen,  it  is
     noteworthy that the enumerated entitlements are all dependent upon the
     family member being lawfully resident in the Member State and,  as  we
     pointed out above, these rights are  precise  and  circumscribed,  for
     example in relation to employment the family  member  must  have  been
     lawfully resident for at least 3  years  (Article  7).   To  interpret
     Article 13 as conferring a right to enter - albeit one limited to  the
     terms of HC 81 - is, in our view, not justified given the careful  and
     progressive manner in which rights under the generalised provisions of
     the Ankara Agreement have been given substance in  concrete  terms  in
     the rules produced through the Association Council Decisions.

 27. Turning to the wording of Article 13  itself,  we  find  the  strained
     interpretation that Mr Walsh requires us to give it to  be  too  great
     for the words  themselves  to  bear.   The  relevant  phrase  is  "new
     restrictions on the conditions of access to employment".  This  phrase
     naturally refers to the worker's ability to obtain employment -  which
     is, of course, itself spelt out in  some  respects  in  Article  6  of
     Decision 1/80 which  progressively  increases  his  entitlement  until
     after 4 years'  lawful  employment  all  barriers  to  employment  are
     removed.  In our view, Article 13 cannot be construed to confer rights
     of entry on particular  terms  upon  the  family  members  of  Turkish
     workers.  It is concerned solely  with  the  worker's  "conditions  of
     access to employment".  This phrase clearly has reference to  national
     rules about access to the labour market.  It is not concerned with the
     circumstances under which the individual works.  The absence of  a  UK
     resident family is not a "condition" relating to a person's "access to
     employment".

 28. Mr Walsh referred us to the cases of Savas (above) and R (Tum) v  SSHD
     [2004] EWCA Civ 788.  Both cases  concern  the  standstill  clause  in
     Article 41(1) of the Additional Protocol concerned with the  right  of
     establishment in business or self-employment.  The terms of the latter
     are different from the standstill clause with which we  are  concerned
     in the case of workers.  In both  decisions,  the  European  Court  of
     Justice and Court of Appeal respectively applied the standstill clause
     to the benefit of Turkish citizens in the UK who wished to remain  and
     engage in business on the basis of the Immigration Rules in  force  at
     the date of the UK's  accession  to  the  EU.   These  cases  do  not,
     however, avail the appellant in the instant  case.   First,  they  are
     concerned with a differently worded standstill clause which  prevented
     new restrictions on "the freedom  of  establishment".   To  apply  the
     current, more  restrictive  Immigration  Rules  was  patently  such  a
     restriction.  The wording of Article 13 of Decision 1/80 is materially
     different referring, as we have seen,  to  "conditions  of  access  to
     employment".  For the  reasons  we  have  already  given,  we  do  not
     consider that these words can be interpreted to cover the  appellant's
     situation.  Secondly, and following on from this, both Savas  and  Tum
     were concerned with the Turkish citizen's position in the UK  and  who
     could rely upon his right of establishment in order for the standstill
     clause to bite.  They were not concerned with  family  union  and  the
     admission to the UK of a Turkish national which, in our view, does not
     fall within the ambit of Article 13.

 29. We acknowledge the European Court of Justice's commitment in this, and
     other, contexts to maintaining 'family  unity'  (see,  e.g  Kadiman  v
     State of Bavaria (Case C-351/97) above).   It  may  well  be  that  if
     there were no provision in the  Immigration  Rules  or  elsewhere  for
     family members to join the Turkish worker in the UK, then there  might
     well be a difficulty and conflict with the  EU  jurisprudence.   That,
     however, is not the case.  Even seen through the benevolent eye of the
     European Court of Justice  and  its  jurisprudence  on  free  movement
     rights, the appellant has failed to make  out  his  case.   There  are
     provisions in HC 395 for  visits  or,  as  in  this  case,  settlement
     because  the  appellant's  father  has  indefinite  leave  to  remain.
     Likewise a family member is entitled to pray in aid Article 8 and  his
     (or her) right to respect for private and family life.  These are  all
     provisions which an Entry Clearance Officer must consider.   There  is
     provision in English law therefore, in the words of the European Court
     of Justice in Kadiman, "to create conditions conducive to family unity
     in the host Member State" (above at [37]) for the  family  members  of
     Turkish workers.   It is no argument in favour of reading in  a  right
     through Article 13 of Decision 1/80, that  in  the  instant  case  the
     appellant simply cannot fulfil the requirements of  HC 395 and, as far
     as we are able to tell, has not specifically relied upon Article 8.

 30. For these reasons, the Entry Clearance Officer was  correct  to  apply
     paragraph 317 of HC 395 to the appellant as the  relevant  Immigration
     Rules in force at the date of his decision and was correct  to  refuse
     the application.

 31. We would make one final observation in respect of this case.  Even  if
     we accepted Mr Walsh's argument, a family member's  right  to  join  a
     Turkish worker in the UK could not arise unless  that  individual  was
     exercising his or her right under the Ankara Agreement.  In this case,
     that would seem to mean a right under one  of  the  three  indents  in
     Article 6.  It is far from clear in this  case  that  the  appellant's
     father is doing so.  Since 15 May 2003 he has had indefinite leave  to
     remain and thus, at least from that date, there was no restriction  on
     his ability to take or seek employment (IND letter dated 15 May 2003).
       In these circumstances, the appellant's father was not reliant  upon
     the Ankara Agreement and the appellant could not, even if we  accepted
     Mr  Walsh's  argument  in  principle,  derive  any  rights  from  that
     agreement.

      Decision

 32. There is no  material  error  of  law  in  the  determination  of  the
     Adjudicator whose decision to dismiss the appeal must stand.
