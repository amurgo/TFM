                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mrs F Bahrami, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lea dismissed the appellant's appeal  on  all
    available grounds.

 2. The appellant sought permission to appeal in terms  of  an  application
    set out in 12 paragraphs.

 3. �6 and 7 of the application criticise �26 of the  decision,  where  the
    judge said, "Given that I have not accepted that the appellant  was  in
    China at this time, I  place  little  reliance  on  this  document"  (a
    medical certificate).  The argument  is  that  the  judge  should  have
    considered the certificate when deciding whether the appellant had been
    in China in 2011, and used circular reasoning to  reach  an  irrational
    decision.

 4. UT Judge Perkins granted permission on each ground, but with particular
    reference  to  the  foregoing.   He  added,  "The  use  of   the   word
    'convincing' at �25 does not improve  the  quality  of  the  decision."



 5. Mr Matthews conceded that the  judge  had  "put  the  cart  before  the
    horse".  He  did  not  concede  that  the  rest  of  the  grounds  were
    necessarily well founded, but he accepted that the error disclosed  was
    so inextricably linked to the  overall  credibility  finding  that  the
    decision could not stand.

 6. Representatives agreed that the outcome should be as follows.

 7. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said on that  occasion.   The
    nature of the case is such that it is appropriate in terms  of  section
    12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice Statement 7.2 to remit  the
    case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Lea.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
