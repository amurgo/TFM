                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Malik made
    following a hearing at Manchester on 3rd January 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  He applied for leave to remain
    in the UK  as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant but was refused  leave
    to remain on that basis on 27th August 2013  under  paragraph  245ZX(d)
    with reference to paragraph 1A of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.

 3. Under the Rules the Appellant was required to demonstrate that  he  had
    been in possession of the required level of funds, namely �800 for each
    month of his course - �1,600 for 28 days prior to the application.

 4. The Appellant submitted with his application his  latest  Halifax  Bank
    statements, dated 14th May 2012, which  showed  a  closing  balance  of
    �6,092.75.   He also submitted a letter from the Halifax dated 1st June
    2012 confirming that the balance as at 1st June 2012 was �5,992.75.

 5. The judge recorded that the  Appellant  produced  at  the  hearing  his
    original bank statements for the months from 7th  March  2012  to  29th
    June 2012.  It was stated on his behalf  that he has not been  able  to
    provide the bank statements with his application because they were  not
    ready, which is why he went  to  his  bank  ands  provided  the  letter
    confirming the balance in his account.

 6. The judge wrote as follows:

         "Section 19 of the UK Border Act 2007  restricts  the  evidence  an
         Appellant can rely on at appeal to that which was provided  to  the
         decision maker . It applies to appeals against immigration decision
         refusals  under  the  PBS.   As  such,  as  the  evidence  of   the
         Appellant's further bank statements were not  before  the  original
         decision maker, I am  unable to consider them in this appeal.

         Whilst the balance of the applicant  account  as  at  the  date  of
         decision was 5,992.75, far in excess of the funds required, and the
         bank statements evidence that he did have the requisite funds for a
         28 day period preceding his application, as this was not before the
         original decision (as stated above in  line  with   Section)  I  am
         unable to consider this new evidence.  As such the appeal is  bound
         to fail."

 7. The Appellant sought permission to appeal in reliance on the  Court  of
    Appeal decision in Rodriguez (Flexibility policy) [2013] UKUT 00042.

 8. The matter came before Judge Davey who refused permission in respect of
    the grounds by reference to the Court of Appeal decision  in  Rodriguez
    and Others [2014] EWCA Civ 2.  However Judge Davey considered that  the
    removal decision under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006 may have been  unlawful and on that basis  granted
    permission to appeal.

 9. On 10th February 2014 the Respondent served a reply submitting that the
    judge did not err  by  not  considering  the  Section  47  issue.   The
    decision was made after 8th May 2013 and was lawful.

10. The Appellant renewed his Grounds of Appeal  arguing  that  the  appeal
    should have been  allowed  by  reference  to  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration Rules and because his case could be distinguished from  the
    Court of Appeal decision in Rodriguez.

11. Unfortunately that application did not come to light until the  day  of
    the  hearing itself.

12. I considered the application in chambers and told  the  parties  of  my
    preliminary view that there was merit  in  the  renewed  grounds,  thus
    giving Mr Diwnycz an opportunity to file a reply.

13. After considering the matter Mr Diwnycz  acknowledged  that  there  was
    considerable merit in the grounds and said  that  he  would  leave  the
    decision in my hands.

14. I provided both parties with a copy of my decision granting  permission
    to appeal on the renewed grounds.

Findings and Conclusions

15. Under paragraph 245AA

         "(a)     where part 6 or any appendices  referred  to  in  part  6A
             stated that specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  UK
             Border Agency will only  consider  documents  that  have  been
             submitted  with  the  application,  and  will  only   consider
             documents submitted safer the application  where  subparagraph
             (b) applies.

         (b)      the subparagraph applies if the applicant has submitted:

             (i)  the sequence of documents and some of  the  documents  in
                  the sequence have been omitted (for example  if  one  bank
                  statement from a series is missing)."

16. This is exactly what happened here. There was a sequence  of  documents
    but one bank statement was missing because it was not available  as  at
    the time of  the  application.   When  the  Respondent  considered  the
    application in August 2013 and it became clear that the sole reason for
    not it not being granted was that one bank statement in  a  series  was
    missing, the Respondent should have contacted the Appellant to  request
    the correct document.

17. The  failure  of  the  Respondent  to  apply  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration Rules renders her decision not in accordance with  the  law
    and the Immigration Rules.

18. The appeal is therefore allowed to the extent that  the  Respondent  is
    required to consider the missing bank  statement.  Since  it  does  not
    appear to  be  a  challenged  that  the  maintenance  requirements  are
    satisfied, it is likely that a grant of leave will be made.

Decision

19. The Immigration Judge erred in law.  Her decision is  set  aside.   The
    following decision is substituted.  The Respondent's decision is not in
    accordance with the law and must be remade.e  He He
