                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department
        (Appellant) against a decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
        Majid (the judge), promulgated on 3 March 2017 in which he  allowed
        the appeals of Mrs Kaur, her  husband  and  son  (the  Respondents)
        against the Appellant's decision of 10 November 2015 refusing their
        human rights claims.


     2. It is unnecessary for me to set out the basis of the  human  rights
        claims, or the Appellant's reasons for refusing those claims.  This
        is because it is accepted by the Respondents, by way of their  Rule
        24 response, that the judge's determination is  unsustainable.  The
        Rule 24 response accepts that  it  is  unclear  whether  the  judge
        believed he was considering a matter under the EEA  Regulations  or
        the immigration rules, that the judge failed to set out  the  facts
        of the case, and that the judge failed to direct himself  correctly
        in accordance with the law.


     3. Even  in  the  absence  of  the  rule  24  response  I  would  have
        independently reached the same conclusion. Despite the appeal being
        based exclusively on human rights grounds the judge,  inexplicably,
        referred to the appeal as being one under the EEA Regulations.  The
        judge clearly misdirected himself in respect of the best  interests
        of the 3rd Respondent (a child), and failed to  make  any  material
        findings.  The  decision  is   woefully   inadequate   and   wholly
        unsustainable.


     4. In these circumstances,  and  without  any  objection  from  either
        party, I indicated that the decision must be set aside and that  it
        would be remitted back to  the  first-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
        hearing, all issues, to be heard by a judge other than judge Majid.



Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision contains material legal errors.
The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to decided afresh by  a
judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Majid.
