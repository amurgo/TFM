Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms Haji of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr Tufan, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, who is a national of Pakistan, born on 31 December  1929
    appealed against the decision of the respondent dated 19 November  2013
    to refuse him leave to remain in United Kingdom outside the Immigration
    Rules and pursuant to Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholls allowed his appeal  pursuant
    to  Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  in  a
    determination dated 14 July 2014. First-tier Tribunal Judge Coyler gave
    the respondent permission to appeal on 15 September 2014.

 2. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey in a determination dated  30  October
    2014 set aside the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  determination  finding
    that there was a material error of law and that the case be  remade  in
    the Upper Tribunal. He stated that "the issues to be addressed are  (1)
    whether or not it is appropriate to look at article 8  outside  of  the
    rules on the basis of the fact in the case as found by the judge and/or
    in the light of any further submissions on law to be made  and  (2)  if
    article 8  is  to  be  considered  outside  the  rules,  what  material
    considerations including the importance to be attached  to  the  public
    interest in the light of the law and case law, whether that leads to  a
    decision being established as disproportionate".

 3. Thus the appeal came before me.

    REMAKING OF THE DECISION


    The Hearing


 4. The appellant gave oral evidence through an interpreter and adopted his
    written statement dated 20 June 2014. He gave  the  following  evidence
    which I summarise. When his wife died on 15 April  2013,  his  children
    would send him money and he hired a servant  to  look  after  him.  The
    difficulty is that a man cannot keep  a  housemaid.  He  has  a  three-
    bedroom house.

 5. The appellant was asked who Tanveer is, who  is  named  on  his  wife's
    death certificate as a person who informed  the  death.  The  appellant
    said it was his neighbour. His son who is a  doctor  came  from  Canada
    where he lives, to Pakistan when his wife was ill. He was asked why the
    death certificate says that Tanveer is the deceased's mother.  He  said
    that he was a neighbour who lives one or two houses away from his.

 6. The appellant was asked whether it was his  intention  to  continue  to
    live in the United Kingdom when he came here on a  visitor's  visa.  He
    said that when he came here, his sons told him that he should  continue
    to live  in  this  country.  Asked  whether  he  is  receiving  medical
    treatment in this country he said that he was receiving treatment in  a
    big hospital. He could not speak and was unconscious for one  week.  He
    was like a dead body.

 7. There was no re-examination.

 8. I asked the appellant how is it that he does not  have  any  family  in
    Pakistan given that in his society the families are very big.  He  said
    that his father was the only son and his brother died. His in-laws live
    in another city. He has relatives but if he goes to them, they will ask
    for him to undergo a second marriage which he does not want to do.

 9. The second  witness  to  give  evidence  was  Mohammed  Nadeem  Shahdad
    (hereinafter the first son) who adopted his written statement dated  30
    June 2014. In examination in chief he gave the following evidence which
    I summarise.

10. Mr Shahdad was asked  when  his  father  came  to  this  country  on  a
    visitor's visa, was it his intention to return to Pakistan. He  replied
    "our mother passed away the only concern was to shift him somewhere  as
    no one was there to look after him". The question was repeated to which
    he replied that his father "came to visit and he had  no  intention  to
    stay here but after our mother passed away we did not have any idea how
    to look after him so we decided for him to stay".

11. He was asked who Tanveer is and he replied "we have a good relationship
    with him he is a next-door neighbour  and  he  applied  for  the  death
    certificate". It was put to him why does the death  certificates  state
    that Tanveer is the deceased mother who informed his death. He  replied
    "because we spent a lot of time she breastfed  one  of  my  neighbour's
    son. It is a very close relationship that could be the reason  he  said
    that he is her son".

12. Mr Shahdad was asked why his father cannot live with Tanveer given  the
    close relationship. He replied "we would like to,  our  father  is  our
    responsibility. We can't just give them to someone else to look  after.
    It  is  the  only  reason".  He  added   "it's   more   emotional   and
    psychological. My brother left for  Canada  and  my  mother  died  soon
    after. I know my father may not last long. He is  comfortable  with  us
    and our children. I don't think anyone can do  that.  I  take  him  for
    Friday prayers. Also there is no organised care in Pakistan  but  there
    is organised care in this country."

13. Mr Shahdad was asked whether there are any family members in  Pakistan,
    he said that there is a cousin who lives in Lahore. He  was  asked  why
    his father cannot live with this cousin and he repeated that  it  is  a
    big responsibility.

14. Mr Shahdad  was  asked  whether  the  appellant  is  receiving  medical
    treatment in the United Kingdom. He replied "we are contributing to all
    the costs, all the brothers". He was asked how the Parkinson's  disease
    affects his daily needs. He said that  getting  up  and  going  to  the
    toilet he needs physical help he can't eat sometimes and  needs  to  be
    fed. He and his wife primarily look after him and his sister  sometimes
    comes as well to look after him. He takes him for coffee in the morning
    and to Friday prayers. He was asked after  his  wife  died  who  looked
    after him. He said that his sister was in the  United  States  and  his
    brother stayed with the appellant until  the  appellant  came  to  this
    country. He cannot return to Pakistan for the appellant to make an  out
    of country application because  he  has  a  job  and  his  family.  The
    application would take 8 to 9 months or a year and he cannot stay  away
    that long. He does not think that his father can travel for the moment.

15. In cross-examination he gave the following evidence which I  summarise.
    It was put to him  that  the  appellant  in  his  evidence  before  the
    previous Judge stated that a wheelchair was arranged for him to  travel
    from Pakistan to the United Kingdom and why that cannot be done for his
    return travel. He said that that was two years ago and his  father  has
    further deteriorated. It was put to him that given that  the  appellant
    could not speak when he was in Pakistan and now he can  speak,  appears
    to be a great improvement in his condition. He said that the  appellant
    speech has improved but  he  needs  help.  He  is  very  emotional  and
    sometimes starts crying. He was asked why the letter from  Dr  Mohammed
    does not give more detailed medical reports  and  has  only  written  a
    brief letter. He said that the doctor  could  see  that  the  appellant
    could not take off his jacket and it was obvious that he needs help.

16. Mr Shahdad was asked why the appellant not apply for settlement in  the
    United Kingdom as a dependent adult relative. He replied "we were under
    stress and grieving my mother's death. There was no one there and I had
    limited knowledge of immigration law and my immediate  thought  was  to
    shift him so he can be looked after". The family was in the majority in
    the United Kingdom and he did not want to waste  time  applying  for  a
    settlement visa. He was asked how he knows that there is  a  settlement
    visa if he did not have any information about immigration law. He  said
    I do not know "the nitty-gritty". He said that  there  was  an  urgency
    because his brother had to go back to Canada. His mother  was  diabetic
    and more or less bedridden. He was  asked  and  who  looked  after  his
    parents at that time to which he replied they hired house help and  his
    mother managed that. He was asked why Tanveer cannot look after him. He
    said that Tanveer "is not a brother but a neighbour. We  want  to  look
    after him we don't want to give responsibility to someone else." It  is
    not fair on anyone to look after him and only his family can give  this
    support.

17. In re-examination he was asked whether his father had an  intention  to
    return when he made his application for a visitor's Visa. He  said  "he
    always wanted to go back he had no choice I don't know his intention if
    he wanted to return. I did not ask him".

18. I asked him who made the decision for him to come here on  a  visitor's
    visa any said that it was a family decision. Asked what their intention
    was at the time, he replied "we did not think through what is going  to
    happen- for the next six months. We just thought let's bring him to the
    United Kingdom and then  think".  He  is  paying  for  the  appellant's
    medical treatment. I asked him then why does the appellant have an  NHS
    number as indicated in the doctor's letter. He said that his father was
    being treated on the NHS. He did not know that his father as a  visitor
    was not entitled to be treated at the  NHS.  They  only  paid  for  his
    dental bills he does not have any medical records for the appellant.

19. The third witness to give evidence  was  Mr  Waseem  Shahid  Malik  who
    adopted his written letter dated 3 December  2013.  In  examination  in
    chief he gave the following evidence which I  summarise.  In  2012  his
    parents came to the United Kingdom for two weeks and he  returned  with
    them to Pakistan. He stayed with them in Pakistan until they could make
    another application for a visa because the appellant needed to wait for
    six weeks before he made another application for  a  visitor  visa.  He
    visited Pakistan six times from 2012 to 2014. The health facilities  in
    Jhelum where the appellant lived are  not  up  to  the  level  like  in
    Islamabad. He and his father  were  travelling  to  and  forth  to  the
    hospital. They did not make an application for  settlement  because  he
    has not had the time for the last two  years.  He  is  a  self-employed
    engineer and his business has been damaged. "if I go back to Pakistan I
    will live there for ever" but he  has  a  wife  and  children  in  this
    country who do not wish to relocate to Pakistan.

20. Mr Malik was asked who is paying for the appellant's medical  treatment
    and he said "I think we are jointly paying". He was asked how much does
    he contribute to the medical bills for the appellant and  there  was  a
    long silence. He said that he sent about �1000  to  Pakistan  when  the
    appellant was in hospital. He was asked how much  did  he  pay  in  the
    United Kingdom, he said they did not count money between  brothers.  He
    was asked again and he said "maybe a thousand pounds from me".

21. In cross-examination he was asked who is Tanveer. He  said  "he  is  my
    brother". He lives in Pakistan and confirmed Tanveer  is  his  mother's
    and father's son.

22. In re-examination he  was  asked  why  can't  Tanveer  look  after  the
    appellant, he said "I think he is very old  and  sick  and  the  socio-
    economic circumstances". He was asked how far does  Tanveer  live  from
    the appellant's house. He said "I do not know I have been living out of
    Pakistan for 25 years. I don't know how many times he has  changed  his
    accommodation".

23. I asked him whether it is costing a lot of  money  to  look  after  his
    father in Pakistan. He said "yes of course it was". I asked him whether
    his father gets medical treatment on the NHS to which he  replied  that
    he does.

24. I heard submissions from both parties and the full notes of the hearing
    are in my Record of Proceedings.

    Findings of Fact


25. In determining whether the appellant's removal from the United  Kingdom
    would constitute a disproportionate  interference  with  his  right  to
    respect for private and family life under Article 8, I have  considered
    each of the following issues, as laid down in Regina  v.  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department,  ex  parte  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27  at
    paragraph 17 of the speech of Lord Bingham of Cornhill:

         (1)      Will the proposed removal be an interference by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or family life?


         (2)      If so, will such interference have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?


          3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


          4) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?


          5) If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?


26. The question that I have to decide is whether the refusal of  leave  to
    the appellant, 'in circumstances where the life of  the  family  cannot
    reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking full account  of
    all considerations weighing in favour of the  refusal,  prejudices  the
    family life of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount
    to a breach of the fundamental right protected by article 8'  (Huang  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007]  UKHL  11  ('Huang'),
    para. 20).  In considering this question, we have  taken  into  account
    all factors that  weigh  in  favour  of  the  Appellant's  deportation,
    including  the  desirability  of  applying  a  workable,   predictable,
    consistent and fair system of immigration control  (Huang,  para.  16).
    Against this, I have taken into account  the  effect  that  refusal  of
    leave would have on the enjoyment of the appellant's private and family
    life in the appellant's case, bearing  in  mind  the  core  value  that
    Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention seeks to protect and the  fact
    that '[t]heir family, or extended family, is the group  on  which  many
    people  most  heavily   depend,   socially,   emotionally   and   often
    financially' (Huang, para. 18).

27. I have further considered the case recent  decision  of  the  House  of
    Lords in Beoku-Betts (FC) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2008] UKHL 39 where the issue for determination was phrased
    in the following terms:

         'In determining an appeal under section 65 of the  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act) (now  sections  82  and  84  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (the  2002  Act))
         against the Secretary of State's refusal of leave to remain on  the
         ground   that   to   remove   the   Appellant    would    interfere
         disproportionately with his article 8  right  to  respect  for  his
         family life, should  the  immigration  appellate  authorities  take
         account of the impact  of  his  proposed  removal  upon  all  those
         sharing family life with him or only its impact upon him personally
         (taking  account  of  the  impact  on  other  family  members  only
         indirectly ie. only insofar as this would in turn  have  an  effect
         upon him)?


28. Baroness Hale observed that 'the right to respect for the  family  life
    of one necessarily encompasses the right to respect for the family life
    of others, normally a spouse or minor children, with whom  that  family
    life is enjoyed'.  It was further said that:  'Together  these  members
    enjoy a single family  life  and  whether  or  not  the  removal  would
    interfere disproportionately with it has to be looked at  by  reference
    to the family unit as a whole and  the  impact  of  removal  upon  each
    member. If overall the removal would be disproportionate, all  affected
    family members are to be  regarded  as  victims'.   In  light  of  this
    decision I have to consider the family life  of  all  those  who  share
    their family life with the appellant which primarily are his  sons  and
    his daughter who live in this country.

29. I have also had regard that  from  28  July  2014  section  19  of  the
    Immigration  Act  2014  is  brought  into  force:  article  3  of   the
    Immigration  Act  2014  (Commencement  No  1,  Transitory  and   Saving
    Provisions) Order 2014 (SI 2014/1820).  This  amends  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 by introducing  a  new  Part  5A  which
    contains sections 117A, 117B, 117D and 117D. Part 5A only applies where
    the Tribunal considers Article 8(2) ECHR directly.


30. It was accepted by Mr Tufan that the first  four  questions  in  Razgar
    must be answered in the affirmative. Therefore the only  question  that
    remains is whether the respondent's decision is  proportionate  to  the
    respondent's legitimate interest in a fair and transparent  immigration
    control.

31. I guide myself that I must make a  fact  sensitive  assessment  of  the
    appellants'   circumstances   and   make   my   own    assessment    of
    proportionality. It is obvious that respect for a claimant's family and
    private life under Article  8  (1)  is  subject  to  proportionate  and
    justified interferences in pursuit of a legitimate  aim  under  Article
    8(2). (Izuazu)

32. I have considered all the evidence in this appeal including evidence to
    which I have not specifically referred.

33. The appellant's case is that he is 84 years of age and  quite  severely
    disabled and cannot care for himself. He came to the United Kingdom  as
    a visitor on 22 May 2013 after the death of his wife on 15  March  2013
    as he felt very lonely. He cannot return to  Pakistan  as  he  will  be
    there on his own and has no family in that  country.  He  is  currently
    living with his son and his son's family. He likes living close to  his
    sister lives in this country and it is reassuring to know that  she  is
    nearby. His health has deteriorated and is not able to fend for himself
    anymore because he  suffered  a  stroke  in  2011.  He  has  also  been
    diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and suffers  from  hypertension.  No
    one in Pakistan will be able to give him the care that he needs.


34. The Court stated in Mokrani v France [2003] 40 EHRR 123, paragraph  33:
    "Relationships  between  adults  do  not   necessarily   benefit   from
    protection under Article 8 of the Convention unless  the  existence  of
    additional elements of dependence other than normal emotional ties  can
    be proven."

35. The appellant's evidence and that  of  his  first  two  sons  who  give
    evidence was that there is no family member in Pakistan  who  can  look
    after the appellant. His case has  been  put  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant cannot return to Pakistan because there is no  one  there  to
    look after him after his wife's death in March 2013.

36. At the hearing, it became apparent that someone named Tanveer  informed
    the authorities of the appellant's wives death. The  appellant  and  Mr
    Shahad said that Tanveer he is the appellant neighbour  who  lives  two
    doors away in Pakistan. Mr  Shahzad,  said  that  Tanveer  is  "like  a
    cousin" and a neighbour who has "sucked on his mother's breast" when he
    was a baby and is very close to the family. Mr Malik  in  his  evidence
    however at the hearing said that Tanveer is his brother  and  confirmed
    that he is his parent's son. This inconsistency in the evidence goes to
    the appellants and his son's credibility. It also demonstrates that the
    appellant and his sons are  not  being  truthful  about  the  appellant
    circumstances in Pakistan.

37. Mr Malik was also inconsistent about not knowing  where  Tanveer  lives
    and said that he does not  remember  how  many  addresses  Tanveer  has
    changed. This is remarkable evidence given that his evidence  also  was
    that he has returned to Pakistan on six occasions  to  look  after  the
    appellant.

38. When the appellant made his visitor  visa  application  he  signed  the
    Declaration  that  he  is  aware  that  it  is  an  offence  under  the
    Immigration Act 1971 (as amended) to make a statement which he know  to
    be false or not believe to be true, in order  to  obtain  a  Visa/entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom. The appellant said that he did  as  he
    was told by his sons. Mr Shahzad said that after their mother died  the
    first thought in their head was "to shift" the appellant to the  United
    Kingdom. After much questioning, it was accepted that  the  Mr  Shahzad
    was making the decisions on  the  appellant's  behalf,  knew  that  the
    appellant was not  going  to  return  to  Pakistan.  I  find  that  the
    appellant came to this country on a visitor's visa and had no intention
    to return and this also goes to his credibility.


39. In Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA  Civ  31,  a  case  which  concerned  an
    adult's relationship with his mother and adult siblings, the  Court  of
    Appeal thought that the following passage in S v United Kingdom  [1984]
    40 DR 196 was still relevant:



         "... generally, the protection  of  family  life  under  Article  8
         involves cohabiting dependants, such as parents and their dependent
         minor children.  Whether it extends to other relationships  depends
         on the circumstances of the particular case.  Relationships between
         adults ... would not necessarily acquire the protection of  Article
         8 of  the  Convention  without  evidence  of  further  elements  of
         dependency, involving more than the normal emotional ties."




40. However, the Court of Appeal considered that  the  further  element  of
    dependency did not have to be economic.  Accordingly, in  the  case  of
    the "other relationships" referred to, it will  be  necessary  to  show
    that ties of support, either emotional or economic,  are  in  existence
    and go beyond the ordinary and natural ties  of  affection  that  would
    accompany a relationship of that kind.


41. The appellant's children have been living in the United Kingdom and the
    appellant has been living  in  Pakistan.  This  demonstrates  that  his
    emotional ties with his children were normal  emotional  ties  expected
    between adults and their parents.

42. I accept that the appellant is not in good health. The appellant has  a
    son who lives in Pakistan a fact which the appellant and his  two  sons
    have attempted to conceal. There is no credible reason to believe  that
    the appellant cannot get this personal and everyday care in Pakistan as
    his son can look after him which I find he  did  before  the  appellant
    came to the United Kingdom.

43. Therefore the appellant came to this country as a  visitor  on  22  May
    2013. The evidence is that he was  not  well  in  Pakistan  as  he  had
    already suffered a stroke in 2011. At the hearing the evidence was that
    he was in a big hospital in Islamabad which cost a lot of money and had
    lost his speech. He has in fact recovered and has resumed  his  speech.
    From the evidence given by the appellant's sons, it is clear  that  the
    appellant required  medical  treatment.  The  appellant  and  his  sons
    conceded that the appellant is getting medical treatment on the NHS. Mr
    Malik said that medical treatment in Pakistan is very expensive and  he
    had to send about �2000 to Pakistan for his treatment after  he  had  a
    stroke.

44. I therefore find that the likely explanation for why the appellant came
    to this country was to seek medical treatment on the NHS, a service  to
    which he is not entitled as  a  visitor.  I  also  do  not  accept  the
    appellant's son's evidence that he did not know that the appellant  was
    not entitled to treatment on the NHS because at first he said that  the
    appellant is being medically treated privately which  is  not  true  as
    evidenced by his NHS number  on  the  file  and  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's witnesses that he is being treated on the NHS.

45. The only evidence of the appellant's medical health is a letter from Dr
    Ahmed who briefly lists the appellant's conditions. At the  hearing  Mr
    Shahzad was asked why he does not have any other  medical  records  for
    his father and whether the doctor has diagnosed the appellant based  on
    what he has been told by the appellant. He said that it must have  been
    obvious to the doctor when the appellant could not take off his jacket,
    that it is difficult for the appellant to do some things.

46. I find that the doctor has written that letter based  on  what  he  was
    informed by the appellant and his sons.  There  are  no  other  medical
    records provided. I therefore place no reliance on the doctor's  letter
    to show that the appellant cannot return to Pakistan to be looked after
    by his son in that country.

47. At first, he said that the appellants had said that the family did  not
    apply for a settlement visa because he did not know anything about  the
    Immigration Rules. He then said in complete contradiction that it would
    have taken 8 to 9 months for the application to be  decided  which  was
    too long. He said that they were acting as a matter of urgency  because
    there was no one to look after the appellant in Pakistan. This  is  not
    true because the appellant has a son who lives in Pakistan.

48. In his visa application the appellant said that he receives a  pension.
    He also stated that he receives an income of $300 per  month  from  his
    son and also has a property in Marla Worth, worth US$200,000.  He  also
    stated that he has two lakh Pakistani rupees available to him  for  his
    visit to the United Kingdom. This demonstrates to me that the appellant
    has sufficient finances to be self-reliant financially in Pakistan. The
    appellant also has a son who lives in Pakistan  and  therefore  he  has
    ties and someone to look after him on his return to Pakistan. I do  not
    accept the appellant's evidence that he does not have  other  relatives
    in Pakistan.

49. I am not persuaded by Ms Haji's submission  that  the  appellant  would
    inevitably succeed pursuant to the Immigration Rules and in  line  with
    the case of Chikwamba, he should not be required to return to  Pakistan
    to make an application because due to his ill-health and the fact  that
    there is no one to look after him in Pakistan. Given that the appellant
    has a son in Pakistan, this submission is not persuasive.

50. I find there are no compelling circumstances in  the  appellant's  case
    for him to succeed  pursuant  to  Article  8  when  he  cannot  succeed
    pursuant to the Immigration Rules  for  entry  clearance  as  an  adult
    dependent relative of a person present and settled in this country.

51. Considering all the evidence in the round I find that even if there  is
    some disturbance in the appellant's private life that he has formed  in
    this country with his sons and sister, it is not  sufficient  to  trump
    the interests of the respondent for a  fair,  transparent  and  orderly
    immigration control. In the cases of Shahzad (Art  8:  legitimate  aim)
    [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC) and FK & OK (Botswana) v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 238, emphasise  the  importance  of
    the public interest in any evaluation of Article 8.  I  find  that  the
    appellant has attempted to circumvent the Immigration  Rules  and  this
    affects the  respondent's  fair  transparent  and  orderly  immigration
    control.
