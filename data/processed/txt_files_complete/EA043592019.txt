Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Malik of Counsel, instructed by Direct Access
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by a citizen of Ghana against a decision of the First-
tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against a decision of the Secretary of
State to refuse him a residence card as a family member of an EEA national.

2. The fundamental issue in the case was whether the appellant was in fact
lawfully married and the First-tier Tribunal decided that he was not.  The
appellant relied on a proxy marriage which, following the decision of this
Tribunal in NA (Customary marriage and divorce - evidence) Ghana [2009]
UKAIT 00009 which decided that customary marriages of the kind that
occurred here were not valid marriages for the purposes of the relevant
law.

3. Mr Tufan was very prompt to draw to my attention that although NA is a
reported decision of the Tribunal it has been considered and decidedly not
followed in several cases in the Upper Tribunal because it is inconsistent
with the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Awuku v Secretary
of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 178.

4. The short point is that Mr Tufan accepted that the disputed marriage was
a valid marriage.  That does not necessarily dispose of the appeal but Mr
Tufan considered his position carefully and decided that although
reservations were expressed there was nothing he could properly rely on to
say that the necessary evidence had not been provided and he accepted that
the appeal had to be allowed outright.

5. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error
of law and substitute the decision allowing the appeal of the appellant
against the Secretary of State's decision.  In the circumstances Mr Malik,
realistically, said nothing whatsoever.  His work had already been done.

Notice of Decision

6. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law. I set aside its decision and I
substitute a decision allowing the appellant's appeal.
