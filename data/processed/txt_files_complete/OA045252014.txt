                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr M Karnik, instructed by Adamsons Law Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Makiyah Ozair, date of birth 18.11.92, is a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy, promulgated  9.9.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  respondent,  dated
    12.9.13, to refuse entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the partner
    (spouse) of Mr Ozair Tayyib, a British citizen present and  settled  in
    the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 4.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Easterman granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 17.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Foudy should be set aside.

 6. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application under Appendix  FM,
    stating that he/she was not satisfied that the claimant's  relationship
    with the sponsor is genuine or subsisting or that they intend  to  live
    together permanently in the UK.

 7. The decision went  on  to  address  the  financial  threshold  and  the
    required  evidence  under  Appendix  FM-SE.  It  was  stated  that  the
    appellant did not meet the threshold requirements and failed to  submit
    the required documents. However, on  the  third  page  of  the  refusal
    decision, it is stated that no final determination  had  been  made  on
    whether the income threshold or the related evidential requirements had
    been met. That is because the Home Office was waiting for  the  outcome
    of the case now reported as R(MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985,
    which held that the ï¿½18,600 threshold was not disproportionate. It  was
    suggested in the refusal decision that if  the  appellant  appealed,  a
    final determination may be made at a later stage. Often that has  taken
    place when the case is considered by the Entry Clearance Manager  after
    receipt of the grounds of appeal. No such review  took  place  in  this
    case and there has been no reconsideration of the grounds for refusal.

 8. It follows that the application of the appellant  was  refused  on  one
    ground only, the genuine and  subsisting  marriage  requirement.  Judge
    Foudy considered  that  only  that  issue  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. She considered the evidence and reached the  conclusion,  for
    the reasons given, that the relationship between the appellant and  the
    sponsor is genuine and subsisting. The Entry Clearance Officer has  not
    appealed that finding.

 9. However, the grounds of appeal suggest that regardless as to whether  a
    final decision had been made on the financial requirements,  "in  order
    to allow the appeal the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal needed to make
    his own  findings on this and as per Kwok On Tong could not  allow  the
    appeal unless satisfied that  the  requirements  of  all  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules were met.  This  would  involve  making  findings  in
    relation to the financial requirements."

10. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge  Easterman  stating,  "In  my
    view, it was arguably not open  to  the  Judge  to  conclude  that  the
    financial aspects were met or agreed  and,  as  a  result,  before  the
    appeal could be allowed it is certainly arguable that the Judge  should
    have satisfied herself that all the elements required under  the  rules
    had been shown."

11. At the outset of the hearing before me, Mr Harrison sought  to  draw  a
    distinction between  the  financial  requirements  and  the  evidential
    requirements of FM-SE, suggesting that the application had been refused
    on both  the  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage  requirement  and  the
    evidential requirement and that it was only the financial threshold  in
    respect of which a final decision had been  deferred.  That  submission
    could not stand on a consideration of the refusal decision, which makes
    clear that both the  financial  threshold  and  evidential  requirement
    issues were not finally determined.

12. The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was against the decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer. "No final determination" is to the same effect
    as no decision. There was no decision by the Entry Clearance Officer on
    either the financial threshold or the evidential requirement. The  only
    decision that could be appealed was in relation to the issue of genuine
    and subsisting marriage.

13. It follows that the only issue before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  in
    relation to genuine and subsisting marriage. The appeal process to  the
    First-tier Tribunal does not carry the requirement  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge to remake the decision that should have been made by the
    Entry Clearance Officer. The judge considered and  decided  the  appeal
    against the decision. She could not  have  considered  or  decided  the
    issues that were left undecided by the Entry Clearance Officer. In  the
    circumstances, I find no error of law on the  part  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.

14. It also follows that as the appeal only  allows  it  on  the  issue  of
    genuine and subsisting marriage, it remains open to the Entry Clearance
    Officer to make a decision on the issues of financial threshold and the
    evidential requirement; there is nothing in the appeal  decision  which
    could prevent that taking place. Mr Harrison suggested that  the  judge
    should have found the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  not  in
    accordance with the law and allowed the appeal to that limited  extent.
    However strange it may be for the representative of  the  Secretary  of
    State to suggest that  a  decision  made  on  her  behalf  was  not  in
    accordance with the law, when it was open to the Secretary of State  to
    cure that by withdrawing the decision and remaking it, it  is  not  for
    the judge to require the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  make  a  final
    decision.

15. All of this is unfortunate, as it  does  not  resolve  the  appellant's
    position. The Entry Clearance Officer may  well  now  refuse  to  grant
    entry clearance and issue a fresh decision on the issues not appealed.

Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a full fee award.

Reasons: The appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer has been dismissed.
