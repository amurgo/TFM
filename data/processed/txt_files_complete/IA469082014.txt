Representation:
Appellant   Mr Nath (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Mr Biggs, Counsel, instructed by MQ Hassan Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh and he  applied  for  limited
    leave to remain as the partner of a person present and settled  in  the
    United Kingdom.

 3. The respondent refused the appellant's application on November 6,  2014
    and the appellant appealed against that decision under section 82(1) of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on November 19, 2014.

 4. The matter was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nolan on  June
    2, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on June  19,  2015  the  Tribunal
    allowed his appeal under Immigration Rules.

 5. The respondent applied for  permission  to  appeal  on  June  23,  2015
    submitting the Tribunal had erred by  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules because at the  date  of  application  the  appellant
    could not  satisfy  Section  E-LTRP  of  Appendix  FM  with  particular
    reference to Appendix FM-SE.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Holmes on September 11, 2015 on the basis the grounds were arguable and
    he also commented that the  Tribunal  had  given  no  consideration  to
    Article 8 outside of the Rules.

 7. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to make an order now.

    SUBMISSIONS

 8. Mr Nath relied on the grounds of appeal and  submitted  that  when  the
    application was made on August 26, 2014 it was accepted  the  appellant
    did not meet the Immigration Rules and that he had only  been  able  to
    meet the Rules in November 2014 when his partner  had  taken  a  second
    job. Section 2 of Appendix FM-SE makes clear what mandatory evidence is
    required and section 120 of the 2002 Act does not restart the clock  as
    was claimed by the appellant's representative in his recently submitted
    skeleton argument

 9. Mr Biggs  relied  on  his  recently  submitted  skeleton  argument  and
    submitted that in light of paragraph GEN 1.9(a)(iii) of Appendix FM the
    validate for such an application was when  the  additional  grounds  in
    section 120 of the 2002 Act was lodged because  otherwise  Appendix  FM
    and Appendix FM-SE would be incoherent. He therefore submitted that the
    findings made by the Tribunal were open to it and there was no error of
    law.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

10. Permission to appeal had been granted to the respondent on the basis it
    was arguable that the Tribunal had erred in finding evidence  submitted
    after the date of application was sufficient to satisfy the maintenance
    requirements under appendix FM and appendix FM-SE.

11. There was no dispute between the parties that when this application was
    submitted the appellant could not satisfy  the  financial  requirements
    set out in section E-LTRP 3.1 of Appendix FM.

12. Mr Biggs submitted that the submission of a section  120  notice  reset
    the date of application to the date that that the notice was served and
    his argument for  that  is  based  on  the  content  of  paragraph  GEN
    1.9(a)(iii)  which  states  that  the  requirement  to  make  a   valid
    application will not apply when the Article 8 claim  is  raised  in  an
    appeal.

13. Section 2 of  Appendix  FM-SE  sets  out  what  documentation  must  be
    supplied with the application. The appellant was obliged to provide his
    partner's payslips for  either  a  period  of  six  months,  where  her
    employment had lasted for at least six months, or twelve  months  where
    her employment was for less than six months.

14. When the application was submitted his partner only had one of her jobs
    and  could  therefore  not  meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules which required him to show that his partner earned  a
    specified gross annual income of at least ï¿½18,600 when his  application
    was lodged. Section E-LTRC 2.2 makes clear that only certain income can
    satisfy that requirement.

15. Mr Biggs has  sought  to  persuade  that  paragraph  GEN  1.9  must  be
    interpreted to refer to the date when the  additional  grounds  in  his
    section 120  notice  were  raised  but  I  do  not  find  his  argument
    persuasive.

16. In Ali v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1198 the Court  of  Appeal  held  that  a
    fresh ground of appeal or statement in response to a section 120 notice
    was not an application within the meaning of  Appendix  A  4th  row  of
    Table 9. So, an applicant who first  applied  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant, who obtained an MBA 6 days before refusal, and then who sought
    to rely on that MBA in a response to a section 120  notice  claiming  a
    right to remain as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) migrant could not do  so.
    The date of application remained the date of the  original  application
    and the MBA had to be issued before then.

17. The principle set out in the above authority has equal  application  in
    this  appeal.  Appendix  FM-SE  makes  it  abundantly  clear  that  the
    specified evidence has to be submitted and must  demonstrate  that  the
    Rules were met prior to the application being submitted. The  appellant
    in this case did not satisfy the Rules and I reject the submission that
    section 120 notice reset the clock.

18. I therefore accept  the  Tribunal  materially  erred  when  finding  in
    paragraph [45]  that  the  financial  requirements  were  satisfied.  I
    therefore set aside that decision.

19. When this matter came before the first Tier Tribunal  it  concluded  it
    was unnecessary to  consider  a  freestanding  Article  8  analysis  or
    whether there were  insurmountable  obstacles  under  section  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM.

20. Mr Biggs has not suggested in his skeleton argument that the  appellant
    satisfied section EX.1 but he has raised Article  8  ECHR.   In  giving
    permission  to  appeal  Judge  of  the   First-tier   Tribunal   Holmes
    highlighted the failure to deal  with  Article  8  ECHR  and  with  the
    consent of both parties  I  propose  to  deal  with  that  within  this
    decision.

21. When this matter came before the Tribunal made the following findings:

      a. The appellant came to the United Kingdom as a Tier  4  students  in
         January 2010 with leave valid until August 26, 2014. Prior  to  his
         leave being curtailed he made  an  application  to  remain  as  the
         partner of person settled and they married on August 26, 2014.

      b. The tribunal was satisfied that his relationship  was  genuine  and
         subsisting in that they intended to live together  as  husband  and
         wife permanently.

      c. Both the appellant and his partner were credible witnesses.

      d. The evidence submitted satisfied with the tribunal that all of  the
         requirements of section E-LTRP were met.

22. For the sake of completeness, I find that there were no  insurmountable
    obstacles that would merit granting the application under section  EX.1
    of Appendix FM because the appellant is almost 28 years of age and  has
    lived the 23 years in Bangladesh.  Nothing  in  the  papers  before  me
    suggests  there  are  any  insurmountable  obstacles  apart  from   the
    inconvenience by the separation potentially would give.

23. I have therefore considered the  Article  8  claim  as  a  freestanding
    claim, outside of  Appendix  FM.  The  Tribunal  in  Forman  (ss.117A-C
    considerations) [2015] UKUT 00412 (IAC) made clear  that  the  list  of
    considerations contained in section 117B and section 117C of  2002  Act
    is not exhaustive.  A court  or  tribunal  is  entitled  to  take  into
    account additional considerations, provided that they are  relevant  in
    the sense that they properly bear on the public interest question.

24. Section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act  emphasises  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control is in the public interest. Other  factors
    to take into account when  considering  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control is the fact the appellant spoke English  and  there
    was no evidence that the appellant would be a financial burden  on  the
    taxpayer. These two factors would also suggest that the appellant would
    be better able to integrate into society. There is also  no  suggestion
    that  the  appellant  formed  his  relationship  whilst  he  was   here
    unlawfully although  clearly  his  relationship  was  formed  when  his
    immigration status was precarious  although  this  is  not  a  specific
    factor set out in section 117B albeit the Tribunal in Forman made clear
    a Tribunal can have  regard  to  additional  factors  when  considering
    proportionality.

25. Mr Biggs invited me to find  that  removal  would  be  disproportionate
    whereas Mr Nath submitted that if the appellant was able  to  meet  the
    Immigration Rules then the correct application should be made.

26. This application was an application made in the full knowledge that the
    Rules were not met. The fact that the Rules were subsequently  met  did
    not undermine the  force  of  the  argument  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control was in the public interest.  I  am  being
    asked to allow his appeal under Article 8 because he did not  meet  the
    Immigration Rules.

27. I have had regard to the factors set out in section 117B but  the  mere
    fact positive answers are given to parts of section 117B does not alter
    the starting  point  that  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control is in the public interest.

28. Mr Nath argued there was nothing to prevent this appellant  making  the
    correct application and satisfying the Immigration Rules.

29. Although the appellant can speak English and his  partner  is  able  to
    financially support them I have to have regard to the fact the  parties
    married in the knowledge  firstly,  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules and  secondly,  in  the
    knowledge that his leave had been curtailed and was due to expire.

30. I have noted the authorities referred to by Mr Biggs  in  his  skeleton
    argument but I am satisfied that refusing the  appellant's  application
    under Article 8 ECHR is proportionate for the reasons given above and I
    therefore refuse this appeal under Article 8.

    DECISION

31. There was a material error.

32. I set aside the original decision and remake the decision.

33. I dismiss the appeal under both the Immigration  Rules  and  Article  8
    ECHR.
