For the Respondent:    Mr P Armstrong, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Proceedings

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 15th of May 1973.  He
      appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Zahed
      who dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the
      Respondent dated 13th of December 2016. That decision was to refuse to
      grant the Appellant asylum, the Appellant arguing  that  the  decision
      also breached this country's obligations under  Article  8  (right  to
      respect for private and family life) of the Human Rights Convention.


   2. The Appellant's claim for asylum was  that  if  he  were  returned  to
      Bangladesh he would face mistreatment from Muslim  extremists  because
      he was a Hindu. His neighbour was an extremist who was a member of  an
      organisation called Jammat - e - Islami and was trying  to  take  over
      the Appellant's property. The  Judge  found  that  the  Appellant  had
      submitted false documents in support of his claim for asylum and  that
      the Appellant had been inconsistent in  his  claim.  No  part  of  the
      Appellant's claim could be accepted because the Appellant had made  it
      all up in order to remain in the United Kingdom. The  Judge  dismissed
      the appeal.


   3. The Appellant appealed the dismissal of his  asylum  appeal  and  also
      argued that the Judge had not  dealt  with  the  Appellant's  separate
      Article 8 claim. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Judge  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal Chohan on 22nd of June 2017 as there  was  nothing
      in  the  decision  to  suggest  that  the  Judge  had  considered  the
      Appellant's human rights claim. It was not  clear  from  the  decision
      whether  human  rights  issues  had  been  raised  by  the  Appellants
      representative.  Nevertheless,  it  was  apparent   from   the   legal
      representative skeleton argument that human rights issues were part of
      the Appellant's claim. On that basis, the Judge had erred.


   4.  Judge Chohan refused permission to appeal the dismissal of the asylum
      claim saying that the First-tier Judge had given careful consideration
      to all the evidence that had been presented and based on that evidence
      made adverse credibility findings. Those findings  were  open  to  the
      Judge and adequate reasons had been given.


   5. The Respondent replied to the grant of permission by letter dated 12th
      of July 2017 stating that any claim under Article 3 usually  stood  or
      fell with an asylum claim. The grounds did not separately identify any
      Article 8 claim and it was not possible to  see  how  one  could  have
      succeeded. Any suggested error was not material.


The Hearing Before Me


   6. When the matter came before  me  to  determine  whether  there  was  a
      material error of law counsel for the Appellant (who had  appeared  at
      first instance) argued that the case should be remitted  back  to  the
      First-tier because the Judge had not dealt with the separate Article 8
      claim. It was acknowledged by the Presenting Officer that this was so.
      I explained to the parties  that  the  First-tier  Judge's  record  of
      proceedings which was on the court file showed that  counsel  for  the
      Appellant in closing  submissions  relied  on  the  skeleton  argument
      submitted in support of the appeal. As was pointed out by Judge Chohan
      when granting permission to appeal the skeleton argument at  paragraph
      13 stated that the Respondent had failed to consider that there  would
      be a serious breach of the Appellant's right to a private life  if  he
      were to be removed from the United Kingdom. The Article  8  claim  was
      set out in approximately a page and ï¿½ in the skeleton argument. It was
      clear therefore that Article 8 had been raised before  the  Judge  and
      should have been dealt with in his determination.


   7. There was no challenge before me  to  the  Judge's  dismissal  of  the
      asylum claim which as Judge  Chohan  pointed  out  was  dismissed  for
      adequate reasons. As the First-tier had not dealt with an issue before
      it I considered that it was in accordance with the Senior  President's
      practice direction that the Article 8 claim should be remitted back to
      the First-tier to be dealt with since otherwise the Appellant would be
      denied a potential avenue of appeal if the Article 8 claim were to  be
      dismissed.


 8. I canvassed submissions as to whether the case should be remitted  back
    to Judge Zahed. This was objected  to  by  counsel  for  the  Appellant
    because the Judge had made a number of adverse credibility findings  in
    dismissing the Appellant's asylum appeal. The  Presenting  Officer  was
    neutral on the matter. I decided that the case should be sent back  for
    the Article 8 appeal to be dealt with but the decision in  relation  to
    the asylum claim would stand. There was no material error of law in the
    Judge's dismissal of the asylum  appeal  and  I  concurred  with  Judge
    Chohan's view for the reasons he gave. As the Appellant lived  in  East
    London, the balance of convenience lay in remitting the matter back  to
    Taylor House (rather than Hatton Cross where the First-tier  had  heard
    the matter) to be heard by any Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  except
    Judge Zahed on the first available date. I therefore so order.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
    law in relation to the Appellant's claim under Article 8. I direct that
    the Article 8 only appeal be remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    to be heard afresh. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to  dismiss
    the Appellant's asylum appeal did not involve the making of a  material
    error of law and that decision will therefore stand.

Appellant's appeal under Article 8 allowed  to  the  limited  extent  stated
    above.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so  doing,
    the Appellant's asylum appeal having been dismissed.


Signed this 24th day of August 2017
