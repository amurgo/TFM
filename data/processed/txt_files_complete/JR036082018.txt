                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson




            Application for judicial review: substantive decision


Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr G  ï¿½  Ceallaigh  of  Counsel,  instructed  by
Universal Solicitors on behalf of the Applicant and Mr S Najib  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department on behalf of  the  Respondent,
at a hearing at Field House, London on 8 March 2019.


      Decision: the application for judicial review is refused

 1. The Applicant, a national of  Bangladesh,  was  granted  permission  to
    apply for Judicial Review of the rejection by the Respondent  dated  21
    February 2018, of the Applicant's  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain as invalid on the basis of failure to pay the relevant fee.


 2. The Applicant's immigration history is as follows.   He  first  entered
    the United Kingdom on 5 September  2009  with  leave  to  remain  as  a
    student valid to 31 January 2012.  On 25 January  2012,  the  Applicant
    applied for further leave to remain as a student which was refused  and
    his appeal against refusal was  dismissed.   He  withdrew  his  further
    appeal before the Upper Tribunal on 4 September 2012 to  allow  him  to
    make a new application for leave to remain.  This was submitted  on  14
    November 2012 and the  Applicant's  appeal  against  that  refusal  was
    allowed on 13 February 2013.


 3. On 9 November 2015, following the Applicant's  successful  appeal,  the
    Respondent refused the application for further leave to remain  on  the
    basis that the Applicant had used fraud in a  previous  application  by
    reliance on a  fraudulent  TOIEC  English  language  certificate.   The
    Appellant's appeal against  that  refusal  was  dismissed  and  he  was
    ultimately appeal rights exhausted in respect of  this  decision  on  9
    November 2017.  The Applicant sought permission  to  Judicially  Review
    the  Upper  Tribunal's  refusal  of  permission  to  appeal  which  was
    dismissed on 10 October 2018.


 4. The Applicant made a further application for leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom outside of the Immigration Rules on  23  November  2017,
    crucially for the purposes of the Immigration Rules, within 14 days  of
    the refusal of  permission  to  appeal  by  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
    Respondent acknowledged the application on 8 December 2017.


 5. On 25 January 2018, the Respondent states that  a  warning  letter  was
    sent to the Applicant's Solicitors on the basis that the  fee  had  not
    been paid and payment should be made within 10 working days,  otherwise
    the application  would  be  automatically  rejected  as  invalid.   The
    Applicant disputes that this letter was ever sent and in any event,  it
    was never received by the Applicant's solicitors.


 6. A copy of that  letter  addressed  to  Universal  Solicitors  at  their
    correct business address has been provided by the Respondent  following
    the grant of permission.  The letter states in bold "You  must  provide
    all of the missing information within 10 working days from the date  of
    this letter otherwise your application will be rejected as invalid." In
    relation to what is missing, it states "Incorrect or no fee  paid"  and
    further that the specified fee has not been paid.   Further  detail  is
    given about the failure and what steps are  required  to  validate  the
    application as follows:


      "Although you provided credit/debit card  details,  the  issuing  bank
      rejected the payment.  Reasons for banks  rejecting  payments  can  be
      numerous including the details provided not matching  the  information
      held by the bank.  The cardholder's name,  address,  expiry  date  and
      issue number supplied on the  payment  form  must  correspond  to  the
      information held by the issuing bank.  If the details fail  to  match,
      the bank will reject the payment.  You must now complete all  sections
      of the payment page with the correct details and  submit  the  correct
      fee."

 7. The consequences for failure to provide the information  requested  are
    reiterated again at the end of the letter that the application will  be
    rejected as invalid if the missing information is not  received  within
    10 days of the date of the letter.

 8. The Respondent's GCID notes for 25 January 2018 state as follows:


      "Case collected for Fee validation Only
      ICD4944 issued to rep @ Universal Sols, E1 7RA
      Case placed in DPTS7 Fee exception shelf: BF Date: 15/02"


 9. There was no further communication from the Applicant or his solicitors
    and therefore the Respondent rejected the  Applicant's  application  as
    invalid on 21 February 2018 on the basis that the required fee had  not
    been paid.  The letter states as follows:


      "You have attempted to make an application for leave to remain in  the
      United Kingdom.


      We wrote to you on 25/01/2018 to notify you that your  application  or
      claim was invalid.  We told you the specific reasons for this and gave
      you  the  opportunity  to  provide  the   required   fee,   additional
      information or documentation.  You have failed to  do  so  within  the
      specified timescale and for the reasons set out below your application
      or claim is rejected as invalid.  ...

      The Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations  2015  specify  the
      fee which (subject to a small number of exceptions) is to be  paid  in
      connection with an application for the  purpose  for  which  you  have
      applied.  If an applicant does not pay the specified fee, his  or  her
      application is invalid.


      The specified fee has not been paid in connection with your  attempted
      application which you made by post on 23/11/2017.  We do not  consider
      that an exception to the requirement to pay the fee  applies  in  this
      case and therefore your application is invalid.


      The statement next to the box ticked below provides more detail  about
      your failure to pay the specified fee and the steps you must now  take
      to validate your application.


      Although you provided credit/debit  card  details,  the  issuing  bank
      rejected the payment.  Reasons for banks  rejecting  payments  can  be
      numerous including the details provided not matching  the  information
      held by the bank.  The cardholder's name,  address,  expiry  date  and
      issue number supplied on the  payment  form  must  correspond  to  the
      information held by the issuing bank.  If the details fail  to  match,
      the bank will reject the payment.  If you make  a  fresh  application,
      and intend to pay by credit card, you must ensure that the information
      provided is correct."

10. This application for Judicial Review was issued on 21 May 2018  on  the
    following  grounds.   First,  that  the  Respondent  erred  in  law  in
    rejecting the application as invalid because the issue is  not  whether
    the specified fee has  been  paid,  but  whether  the  application  was
    accompanied by sufficient authorisation from the  Applicant  to  enable
    the Respondent to collect  the  requisite  fees  (which  the  Applicant
    asserts it was), as in the cases of BE (Application Fee: Effect of Non-
    payment)  [2008]  UKAIT  00089;  Basnet  (validity  of  application   -
    respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC), Mitchell (Basnet revisited) [2015]
    UKUT 00562 (IAC) and Ahmed & Ors (valid application - burden of  proof)
    [2018] UKUT 00053 (IAC).


11.  Secondly,  and  in  the  alternative,  the  Applicant  challenges  the
    rejection of his application as procedurally unfair; in breach  of  the
    common law duty of fairness and not in accordance with the Respondent's
    own guidance as he had not received any prior  notice  of  any  problem
    with the payment of the specified fee, the letter dated 25 January 2018
    never having been received.


12. Permission was granted by  Mr  Justice  Swift  at  an  oral  permission
    hearing on 5 December 2018 for the following reasons:


      "(1) This claim concerns whether the Secretary of State  was  entitled
      to conclude that an application was invalid because the  fee  was  not
      paid.  The application had included payment information to permit  the
      Secretary of State to receive  payment  electronically,  but  when  he
      attempted to obtain payment the transaction was declined.   The  issue
      is whether the Secretary of state then wrote to warn the Claimant that
      the transaction had failed (as set out in his policy on  "Applications
      for leave to remain ..." etc).  The  Secretary  of  State  claims  the
      letter was written; the Claimant says no such letter was received.  At
      the time of the permission application, a copy of the letter  was  not
      available.  The claim is therefore arguable on the basis (a)  was  the
      letter written: and (b) was it sent to the correct address (i.e.  that
      specified on the application).


      (2) There is a further point which the Tribunal may wish to address at
      the substantive hearing.  This is  whether  an  application  is  valid
      simply because  it  contains  payment  details,  or  whether  validity
      depends on payment being made (when the Secretary of  State  uses  the
      payment details).   The  application  for  permission  relied  on  the
      judgment in Basnet  [2012]  UKUT  113  (IAC),  ï¿½  18  for  the  former
      proposition - i.e.  that  if  payment  details  were  set  out  on  an
      application form that was sufficient  regardless  of  whether  or  not
      payment was obtained.  That conclusion was reached on the  wording  at
      regulation 37 of the 2011 Fees Regulations (2011/1055).   In  my  view
      that proposition no longer holds good, given the materially  different
      language in the 2017 Fees Regulations (2017/515) - see  regulation  16
      which refers instead to failure to "pay that fee".   It  seems  to  me
      that validity now depends on whether the payment is  made.   Had  this
      issue been the only  point  at  the  hearing,  I  would  have  refused
      permission to apply for Judicial Review.  In my  view  the  effect  of
      regulation 16 of the 2017 Regulations is beyond  reasonable  argument.
      But as I granted permission on the issue at  (1)  above,  I  indicated
      that this point as to the 2017 Regulations should be addressed at  the
      substantive hearing so that the Tribunal can  give  a  fully  reasoned
      judgment on the point."

13. In his written statement,  the  Applicant  confirms  that  the  payment
    details in his application were completed  by  his  solicitor,  in  his
    presence, which he double checked.  The details were correct,  complete
    and the payment page was signed to authorise payment.  The Applicant at
    all times had sufficient funds in his account, supported by a  copy  of
    his bank statement for the relevant period.


14. In November 2018, the Applicant contacted his bank to ask whether  they
    had received any request for payment from  the  Respondent  between  23
    November 2017 and 21 February 2018 but they were unable to  check  this
    as their  records  only  went  back  six  months  and  the  information
    requested pre-dated this.

15. In his written statement, the Applicant's solicitor, Mr Md Asaduzzaman,
    confirmed that he completed the Applicant's application form, including
    the payment details page, checked the contents and then  the  Applicant
    checked and signed the form.  He further states that the  letter  dated
    25 January 2018 was never received by  Universal  Solicitors,  nor  was
    there any other warning of problems with payment of the fee.

Relevant Regulations and Guidance

16. The current regulations in relation to fees, so far as relevant to this
    application, is contained in  Regulation  17  of  the  Immigration  and
    Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2017, which provides as follows:

    "(1) Where a person is  required  to  pay  a  fee  specified  in  these
        Regulations, but fails to pay that fee, the Secretary of State may -


           a) reject the application as invalid; or
           b) request the person to pay the outstanding amount.
      (2) Where paragraph (1)(b) applies -
           (a) the person must pay the outstanding amount within 10 working
              days beginning with the day on which the request for  payment
              was made;
           (b) if the outstanding amount is  not  paid  within  the  period
              mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), the Secretary of  State  must
              reject the application as invalid.
      (3) Where the request for payment is made -
           (a) in writing, the period of 10 working  days  referred  to  in
              paragraph (2)(a) begins on the day that the request is sent;
           (b) by telephone or in person, on the day that  the  request  is
              made.

17. The previous regulations in relation to fees, which  were  those  under
    consideration in Basnet, Mitchell and Ahmed, were the  Immigration  and
    Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2011, which provide so far  as  relevant
    (and in terms on which  there  was  no  practical  distinction  to  the
    earlier 2007 Regulations):

      "37. Where an application to which these Regulations refer  is  to  be
      accompanied by a specified fee, the application is  not  validly  made
      unless it has been accompanied by that fee."

18. The relevant guidance from the Respondent is contained in 'Applications
    for leave to remain; validation, variation and withdrawal, version 1.0,
    6 April 2017' in the following section:

      "Requirement: Fee payment

      ...

      If an applicant has not paid the correct fee, you must write  to  them
      and give them 10 working days to rectify  their  mistake  and  provide
      instructions on how to pay the correct fee.  If they do not  do  this,
      you must reject  the  application  as  invalid  using  the  notice  of
      invalidity template: ICD 4946 on Doc Gen.

      You must include all the evidence you can to support the decision that
      the applicant has not paid the correct fee.  Evidence of payment pages
      are kept for 18 months by the Home Office and so reasons  for  failure
      to obtain payment can be investigated by  referring  to  those  pages.
      You should note on CID how you know that the applicant  has  not  paid
      the fee.   However;  the  reasons  a  payment  is  declined  are  only
      available to the account holder and so it is not always  possible  for
      the Home Office to say why a payment was not received,  only  that  it
      was not paid.  This was the approach set out by the Upper Tribunal  in
      Mitchell (Basnet revisited) [2015] which clarified Basnet."

Applicant's submissions

19. On behalf of the Applicant, Mr ï¿½ Ceallaigh asserts  that  there  is  no
    doubt that (i) the Applicant was  required  to  pay  a  fee;  (ii)  the
    Applicant  submitted  the  correct  details  to  the  Respondent,  with
    adequate funds available; (iii) the Respondent was nevertheless  unable
    to take the fee; (iv) the Respondent was  required  by  his  policy  to
    write to the Applicant warning him  of  this  and  giving  him  another
    chance to pay;  and  (v)  the  Respondent  intended  to  write  to  the
    Applicant as required.  The  issues  identified  are  whether  (i)  the
    Respondent actually wrote to the Applicant as  required  and  (ii)  the
    Applicant in fact failed to pay for the purposes of the Immigration and
    Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2017.


20. As to the first issue, the Applicant's  case  is  that  the  Respondent
    bears the burden of proof to show that the letter dated 25 January 2018
    was actually sent and that he has failed  to  adduce  any  evidence  in
    support of the same; showing only that a letter  was  produced.   Mr  ï¿½
    Ceallaigh  submitted  that  it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect   the
    Respondent to produce a contemporaneous note confirming the letter  was
    posted as required and/or a witness statement from the caseworker  said
    to have sent it, and/or a statement from the caseworker as to the usual
    practise of posting such correspondence and the  meaning  of  'issued'.
    To the contrary, the Applicant has produced uncontested  evidence  from
    himself and his Solicitor that the letter was  never  received.   Mr  ï¿½
    Ceallaigh accepted that there was  no  evidence  from  the  Applicant's
    Solicitor as to post handling procedures within the firm, but submitted
    that such evidence was not necessary in circumstances where the  burden
    of proof is on the Respondent and he has produced no proper evidence.


21. As to the second issue, the burden is again on the Respondent to  prove
    that the Applicant has failed to pay the specific fee (as in Ahmed) and
    no evidence has been adduced in support of that.  To the contrary,  the
    Applicant has confirmed that he  correctly  completed  the  application
    form and had the appropriate funds in his bank account at the  relevant
    time.


22. Mr ï¿½ Ceallaigh submitted that the requirement in the  2017  Regulations
    refers to situations where a person is required to pay a fee but  fails
    to pay a fee; not that the fee has not been paid.  There are two things
    required for an application to be invalid, first, the fee is  not  paid
    and secondly, the failure is attributable to the Applicant.   In  these
    circumstances, the analysis in Basnet, Mitchell and Ahmed continues  to
    apply to the current Regulations.

Respondent's submissions

23. On behalf of the Respondent, Mr Najib  submitted  in  relation  to  the
    first issue that the Respondent has produced a copy of the letter dated
    25 January 2018 and GCID notes which confirm the  letter  was  written,
    correctly addressed to  the  Applicant's  solicitors  and  recorded  as
    'issued' to them.  This is a contemporaneous record of the letter being
    sent by the relevant  caseworker.   This  evidence  addresses  the  two
    reasons for which permission was granted by Mr  Justice  Swift  on  the
    first issue.


24. The Applicant's suggestion that further evidence was required from  the
    Respondent to satisfy his burden of proving  the  letter  was  actually
    sent was submitted to be without merit for the following reasons.   The
    Respondent's Summary Grounds of  Defence  (signed  by  a  statement  of
    truth) confirm that the usual practise would be to send such  a  letter
    by second class post; a caseworker could  not  be  expected  to  recall
    posting an individual letter and the contemporaneous GCID notes  record
    that the letter was 'issued' which can only mean sent.  The  Respondent
    is not responsible for the letter being physically received or received
    at any particular date or time.


25. In  relation  to  the  second  issue,  the  Respondent  relies  on  the
    interpretation of Mr Justice Swift in the  grant  of  permission;  that
    there has been a material  change  in  the  requirements  in  the  Fees
    Regulations  between  those  in  2007  and  2011,  which  required   an
    application to be 'accompanied by a fee' and in 2017 which  required  a
    person to 'pay the fee'.  The latter must mean actually  pay  the  fee.
    As such, reliance on Basnet and Ahmed is misplaced in  respect  of  the
    2017 Regulations.


26. Further, in terms of why a payment failed, the Respondent is  not  best
    placed to provide evidence of why this is the case.  The Respondent  is
    not privy to such information from the bank and would  not  practically
    or realistically be able to say, for example, that the card number  had
    been entered by the Respondent wrongly.  The Applicant is in  the  best
    position to obtain the reasons why the  payment  failed  by  contacting
    them for this information and if there is no such record of  a  request
    for payment from the Respondent, that would tend to suggest an error by
    the Respondent.  In  the  present  case,  the  Applicant  waited  until
    November 2018 to request information  from  his  bank,  by  which  time
    records had been destroyed and it was too late to find out  the  reason
    why the payment failed.

Discussion

27. In  this  application  for  Judicial  Review,  the  burden  is  on  the
    Respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the  warning
    letter dated 25 January 2018 to the Applicant's  Solicitors  indicating
    that the specified fee had not been paid and giving them 10 days within
    which to rectify the problem, was sent.   That has clearly been met  in
    this case by the provision of a copy of the letter itself together with
    a contemporaneous note from the caseworker recorded on the  GCID  notes
    that the letter had been issued.  There can be no other  interpretation
    of the word 'issued' in this context than that it was  sent.   Further,
    there is no dispute that the letter  was  correctly  addressed  to  the
    Applicant's Solicitors and their name and  postcode  is  also  recorded
    correctly on the GCID notes.


28. The Applicant's suggestion that further evidence was required from  the
    Respondent to show, on the balance of probabilities,  that  the  letter
    was  sent  is  without  merit.   First,  it  is  not  necessary   where
    contemporaneous case records have been provided and secondly, it  would
    be wholly unrealistic and impractical for any party to provide the kind
    of evidence that was suggested.  By the time of issue even of the  pre-
    action protocol letter, several months had passed since the letter  was
    issued  and  it  is  unrealistic  to  suggest  that  a  caseworker  may
    specifically remember what was essentially a  proforma  letter  and  be
    able to set out what happened after it was created.  Within  an  office
    environment, post trays and services are inevitably used such  that  an
    individual caseworker would not have responsibility or control over any
    particular letter through to actual posting of  the  same.   A  witness
    statement from the caseworker would add not add  anything  material  to
    the evidence to be considered in this case and the Respondent confirmed
    in the Summary Grounds of Defence the usual practice when posting  such
    letters.  Those grounds were signed by a  statement  of  truth  and  no
    witness evidence of the same was necessary in the context of this  case
    where the letter, together with  the  GCID  notes  were  in  any  event
    together sufficient on the balance of probabilities to show the  letter
    was sent.

29. In light of the way in which the grant of permission in this  case  was
    phrased, it is likely that if the evidence of the letter and  the  GCID
    notes had been disclosed by the Respondent with his Summary Grounds  of
    Defence, permission would not have been granted on the first ground  at
    all.


30. For these reasons, the application for Judicial  Review  fails  on  the
    first ground of challenge (as numbered in  the  grant  of  permission).
    The Respondent did comply with his Guidance (set out above) by  issuing
    a warning letter and giving  the  Applicant  10  days  to  rectify  the
    failure to pay the specified fee required, which he failed to do.   The
    rejection of the application as invalid was  then  done  in  accordance
    with Regulation 16(2)(b) of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  (Fees)
    Regulations 2017 as the outstanding amount had not been paid.


31. In relation to the second ground of  challenge,  I  respectfully  agree
    with the view of Mr Justice Swift that  the  Applicant's  challenge  in
    reliance on Basnet and following cases is  beyond  reasonable  argument
    due to the material change in the  wording  of  the  Regulations.   The
    submissions before me do not significantly expand on the way  in  which
    the case was put originally.


32. Regulation 16(1) of the Immigration and Nationality (Fees)  Regulations
    2017 refers to a person being required to pay a fee, 'but fails to  pay
    that  fee',  which  on  any  reading  can  only  be  interpreted  as  a
    requirement  to  actually  pay  the  fee;  rather  than   provide   the
    information and authorisation required to  pay  the  fee,  as  per  the
    interpretation of the previous Regulation 37  of  the  Immigration  and
    Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2011 which required an application to be
    'accompanied by that fee'.  There is no dispute  in  the  present  case
    that the fee was not paid and in essence that is the end of the matter.


33. The Applicant submitted that the burden is on the Respondent  to  prove
    that the Applicant has failed to pay the specific fee,  i.e.  that  the
    failure to actually pay the fee must be attributable to the  Applicant.
    Even if the requirement to actually pay the fee goes this far, which  I
    do not accept, this ground of challenge still fails  on  the  facts  of
    this case in accordance with the detailed explanation of the burden  of
    proof in cases (albeit under the previous Regulations which  no  longer
    apply) given by Mr Justice Lane in Ahmed from paragraph 46 onwards.   A
    distinction is drawn, as between the  cases  of  Basnet  and  Mitchell,
    between cases where an application  is,  on  its  face,  insufficiently
    completed (where the  burden  of  proof  of  its  validity  is  on  the
    Applicant) and where an attempt has been made to obtain  payment  which
    has failed (where the burden of proof is on the Respondent).


34. In the present case, the Applicant has asserted that he  completed  the
    payment page correctly and a copy of the page was available to him  and
    to the Upper Tribunal.  If the burden of proof is on the Respondent, it
    is not necessarily required that an Applicant provide anything further,
    however, it is noted there is no documentary  evidence  that  the  card
    details themselves were correct  and  the  card  was  destroyed  around
    November 2018 when it expired.   There  is  in  any  event  an  obvious
    problem on the face of the payment page as to why the payment may  have
    been  declined,  that  is  that  the  address  given  is  that  of  the
    Applicant's Solicitors and not the personal address of  the  Applicant,
    the latter being the address which would be on record  with  his  bank.
    As is clear from the warning letter and decision letter, one reason why
    a payment may fail is that the person's details do not match those held
    by the bank.  Whilst there is no evidence either way as to whether this
    was the reason the payment was declined in the present case,  it  is  a
    possible reason and it does case doubt on the assertions  made  by  the
    Applicant that all the details were correct - on its  face,  they  were
    not at least in respect of his address.  This puts  the  case  somewhat
    between those in Basnet and Mitchell as the application on its face  is
    arguably not sufficiently completed, but an attempt to take payment was
    made and declined.

35. As to what is required of the Respondent to  discharge  the  burden  of
    proof, Mr Justice Lane continued in paragraph 48 of Ahmed as follows:


      "48. What is required to enable the Respondent to discharge the burden
      of proof (to the balance of probabilities standard) will depend on the
      nature of the evidence she is able to adduce, and  this  in  turn  may
      depend on whether any request was made by an appellant to  obtain  the
      payment details.  If, in an appeal, the  issue  of  invalidity  arises
      within 18 months of receipt by the payment processing  centre  of  the
      payment details,  then  the  respondent  will  have  access  to  those
      details.  The fact that the invalidity  decision  may  not  have  been
      immediately challenged has no bearing on determining which party  must
      discharge the burden of proof, but it may be relevant  in  determining
      whether the legal  burden,  including  an  initial  evidential  burden
      requiring the respondent to raise sufficient evidence to  support  her
      invalidity allegation, has been discharged.  If an  appellant  has  an
      opportunity of requesting the payment details from the respondent  but
      does not avail himself of that opportunity  in  a  timely  manner,  he
      cannot rely on the respondent's  inability  to  obtain  those  payment
      details.  The reasons  for  a  delay  in  challenging  the  invalidity
      decision or requesting the payment details may therefore  be  relevant
      in determining whether the respondent has  discharged  the  burden  of
      proof when considered in conjunction with the other evidence.


      49. It will be  rare  in  a  statutory  appeal  for  the  respondent's
      assertion that an application is invalid to be entirely unsupported by
      other evidence.  The respondent will almost always be able to  provide
      information maintained on the GCID, which will  usually  include  some
      basic information relating to payment (but not  the  debit  or  credit
      card details).  If the GCID notes indicate that payment  was  declined
      (which suggests that an attempt to obtain payment was made),  and  the
      opportunity of obtaining  the  payment  pages  has  passed,  this  may
      suffice in discharging a preliminary evidential burden,  requiring  an
      appellant to then produce evidence that  their  bank  or  credit  card
      account had sufficient funds throughout the relevant  period  or  that
      the credit card limit or transaction limit had not been  breached,  or
      that the bank or credit card company did  not  decline  payment.   The
      absence of any such rebuttal evidence may  ultimately  result  in  the
      respondent having discharged the legal burden.  The  question  whether
      the respondent has ultimately discharged the  legal  burden  of  proof
      will therefore depend on the nature and quality  of  evidence  she  is
      able to provide, having regard  to  the  timing  of  any  request  for
      payment details and the reasons for any delay,  balanced  against  any
      rebuttal evidence produced by an appellant.


      50. As noted in Mitchell, an appellant can and should be  expected  to
      make inquiries of his or her bank or credit card company to  determine
      whether it received a request for payment and  whether  and  for  what
      reasons payment was declined.  If the payment is being  taken  from  a
      bank account, details of the funds held in that  account  are  clearly
      relevant, as would be any reasons for a decline of payment.   Also  of
      relevance would be evidence that credit or  transaction  limits  or  a
      credit card have not been reached in respect of the  relevant  period.
      If  a  bank/credit  card  company  maintains  that  no  payments  were
      declined, this may be prima facie evidence that  the  payment  details
      used did not relate to that particular  account,  either  because  the
      wrong details were provided by an  appellant,  or  because  they  were
      input incorrectly when  the  processing  centre  attempted  to  obtain
      payment.  We endorse the observation in Basnet that there  can  be  no
      presumption  that  an  appellant  may  have   inadvertently   supplied
      incorrect details, just as there can be no  presumption  that  payment
      systems are infallible."

36. Further, the Respondent's submissions  in  the  present  case  were  in
    accordance with the evidence previously before the Upper Tribunal about
    an individual being best placed to find out the reasons why payment was
    declined from their own bank/credit card company.


37. In the present case, I find that even if the failure to pay a fee  must
    be attributable to a failure on behalf of the Applicant, the Respondent
    has discharged the burden of proving that there was a failure to pay in
    accordance with the decision in Ahmed and for  the  following  reasons.
    The Respondent has provided prima facie evidence  that  an  attempt  to
    take payment was made but declined and has provided the payment details
    page.  The  payment  page  completed  by  the  Applicant/his  Solicitor
    included on its face a reason why payment may have been declined.   The
    Appellant's evidence in rebuttal included bank statements to show  that
    sufficient funds were available, but  he  failed  to  act  promptly  in
    requesting further information from his  bank  about  the  reasons  why
    payment was declined, which he was reasonably  expected  to  have  done
    given the payment page was available to him.   In these  circumstances,
    on the balance of probabilities,  the  Respondent  has  discharged  the
    burden.   For these reasons, the application for Judicial  Review  also
    fails on the second ground of challenge.

Order


I order, therefore, that the judicial review application be dismissed.

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

No application for permission to appeal has been made but in any event I  am
obliged to consider  whether  to  grant  permission  to  appeal.   I  refuse
permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal because  there  is  no  arguable
error of law in the decision.


Costs

The Applicant shall pay the Respondent's reasonable costs from  25  February
2019, to be assessed if not agreed.

The Respondent disclosed key  documents  in  relation  to  this  claim  (the
letter of 25 January 2018 and corresponding GCID notes) only on 25  February
2018; which could and should have been disclosed at a  much  earlier  stage.
The absence of this evidence  was  the  primary  reason  for  the  grant  of
permission and in these circumstances, up to the point  of  disclosure,  the
Applicant should not be responsible for the Respondent's costs.
