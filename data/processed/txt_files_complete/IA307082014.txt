For the Appellant:     Mr R Singer of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 7th October  1983.   She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 25th July  2014  to
    refuse her application for further leave to remain in this country as a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under  the  points-based  system  and  to
    remove her by way of directions under Section 47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  Her appeal was allowed  by  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Buckwell sitting at Taylor House on  1st  April
    2015.  In a decision dated 4th November 2015 I set the decision of  the
    First-tier aside on the grounds of material error of law such that  the
    appeal fell to be re-heard.  Annexed to this determination is a copy of
    my decision on 4th November 2015 in which I gave my reasons for finding
    an error of law.

2.   The Appellant was granted leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  on  21st
    March 2011 as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  valid  until  16th  February
    2012.  Her visa was subject to conditions  restricting  employment  and
    recourse to public funds and her work was limited to twenty  hours  per
    week during term time.  On 6th June  2012  she  was  granted  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant
    valid until 6th June 2014.  Shortly before that leave was due to expire
    she made her application for further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant (investing at least �50,000) on 23rd  May  2014.
    The Appellant was obliged to score  75  points  under  Appendix  A  for
    attributes. This was 25 points for access to funds, 25 points for money
    in a regulated financial institution and 25 points for money disposable
    in the United Kingdom.

The Application for Leave to Remain

3.   The Appellant stated that she had �84,000 available for  investment  in
    her business AMS London Limited.  She was a director  of  that  company
    and her job title was marketing consultant.  The Appellant  supplied  a
    number of documents with her application form including a business bank
    statement;  a  current  appointment  report   from   Companies   House;
    certificate of incorporation; a list  of  directors  and  shareholders;
    advertising material comprising business  card,  Gumtree  advertisement
    and a visiting card;  printout  of  the  website;  affidavit  from  the
    Appellant's mother (who was providing some of the funding) along with a
    letter from her advocate; a business plan; a CT60 from HM  Revenue  and
    Customs; original of a marketing contract; tenancy at  will;  insurance
    policy; telephone bill;  a  CV;  membership  certificate  of  the  IFA;
    personal bank statements for 120 days; a letter  from  the  Appellant's
    accountant;  audited  accounts.   She  also  provided  details  of  her
    educational qualifications; a PAYE letter  from  HMRC  and  the  latest
    employer's PAYE summary.

The Respondent's Pre - interview Consideration

4.   Following the submission of the Appellant's application with  documents
    in support the Appellant was called for interview on 30th June 2014  at
    Sheffield. The Respondent compiled some risk assessment notes prior  to
    the interview indicating why an interview  was  sought  in  this  case.
    There had already been an approved  entrepreneur  application  made  by
    Muhammad Siddiq Ur Rasool as an accountant  who  had  invested  �50,000
    into AMS London Limited on 1st July 2013.  The bank statement  for  the
    company showed funds of just over �12,000 two  days  before  a  �75,000
    investment from the Appellant.  Throughout December and January 2013/14
    only one payment was received into the business.   There  were  several
    high  payments  debited  out  of  the  account  for   unknown   reasons
    particularly a payment on 28th April 2014 for �20,000  to  Pine  Valley
    Limited for a marketing campaign.  It was questionable why the  company
    would need to pay a significant amount  of  money  for  this  when  the
    Appellant was their marketing director who should be able to  undertake
    that role.  An employee of Pine Valley Limited Avreet Singh was also an
    employee of AMS London Limited raising further questions as to why that
    money had been paid out.

5.   The investment from Mr Rasool had already disappeared which  questioned
    the integrity of the company.  The only  money  left  in  the  business
    account was the money invested by the Appellant.   Why  were  there  no
    other funds  from  the  other  directors?   As  the  company  had  been
    established since 2009 what research had the  Appellant  undertaken  to
    ensure that it was a profitable company and she had made an investment?
     What was she  bringing  to  the  company?   There  were  spelling  and
    grammatical errors in the business plan and the font changed during the
    document which indicated  a  lack  of  professionalism  and  care  when
    completing the plan.  Who had written it?  The Appellant had stated she
    was working for AMS London Limited since late  2013  (in  the  business
    plan) and they  asked  to  her  to  become  a  director.   However  the
    Appellant's statements to show what she was living  on  showed  regular
    payments from Oracle Limited a bookkeeping company also  based  at  the
    address in Ilford of AMS London Limited.  This discrepancy  cast  doubt
    on the Appellant's intentions  indicating  that  she  was  earning  her
    living by working for Oracle Limited.  The advertising on  Gumtree  was
    very limited and its professional appearance was questionable.

The Interview

6.   A transcript of the record of  interview  was  made  available  in  the
    Respondent's bundle for the appeal.   The  Appellant  stated  that  AMS
    London Limited was incorporated in 2009 as an accountancy business  but
    was dormant until it started trading in 2012. She joined the company in
    March 2014 putting a marketing section into the company.  In  2014  she
    submitted an annual return for AMS London Limited adding herself  as  a
    director and a 50% shareholder.  The Appellant  had  been  working  for
    Oracle Limited  part-time  as  a  marketing  consultant  and  assistant
    accountant from August 2011 until June 2014.  Before that she worked in
    Pakistan with Citibank and  did  her  Masters  degree  in  Pakistan  in
    management.

7.   The last client the Appellant  had  identified  marketing  requirements
    for was Sefron Door Banqueting.  She signed a contract with them on 9th
    June 2014 (after lodging her application) charging �3,000 for  advising
    how to reach out to customers.  The contract was  for  six  months  and
    thus at the time of interview it had not been long in  existence.   AMS
    London Limited were working in the same building in Green  Lane  Ilford
    as Oracle Limited.  The address was used by a lot  of  businesses  that
    were registered there but not trading from those premises.  By  way  of
    market research for the demand for her business she had engaged in face-
    to-face interviews with approximately fifteen to  twenty  people  as  a
    "mystery shopper" visiting  businesses  such  as  Brian  Thomas  Estate
    Agents Limited pretending she was a customer to see if there was a need
    for a marketing company in a  five  mile  radius  of  the  premises  in
    Ilford.  If she were  subsequently  instructed  by  a  well-established
    company she would charge them �2,000.

8.   25 to 30 businesses operating in a five mile radius were  offering  the
    same kind of  services  but  they  were  print  ad  companies  or  just
    providing websites one could not visit them.  She was  advertising  her
    own business through Gumtree and through leaflets.  The  response  from
    advertisements had not been great.  She did not have a slogan  but  had
    written the wording for the adverts herself.  Clients made contact with
    her company  through  what  she  described  as  an  accountancy  client
    referral, AMS London Limited was an accountancy firm and it was  easier
    to target existing clients of the company.

9.   The Appellant obtained the funds to  invest  in  the  business  from  a
    property inheritance fund that her mother had sent money to  her.   The
    funds were now in a Barclays business account.  The Appellant  received
    �75,000 from her mother. The remaining �9,000 (to bring the total up to
    �84,000) was comprised of  a  gift  of  �3,500  from  her  mother,  the
    Appellant's own savings and a loan from a friend.  The �75,000 came  in
    on 31st March 2014, the  remaining  monies  between  March  and  April.
    There were two other directors, one had not invested any  money  so  he
    had no shares, the other  director  had  invested  �55,000  or  �60,000
    before her arrival but she did not have any details of that.

10.  The Appellant knew the directors of AMS London Limited from before  and
    worked with them as a marketing consultant for a couple of months.  She
    had been added as a signatory to the company's bank  account.  She  had
    written the business plan herself.  She had  recruited  one  member  of
    staff in April 2014 as a business development officer being  paid  �750
    per month.  She was continuing to work part-time  with  Oracle  Limited
    until June but as  at  the  date  of  interview  was  focusing  on  the
    business.  She had �3,000 in savings so could easily  support  herself.
    Pine Valley Limited had a loan agreement for �20,000  with  AMS  London
    Limited. She herself had made an  interest  free  loan  to  AMS  London
    Limited who were liable to pay her back in  three  years  if  all  went
    according to plan.

11.  Following the interview the interviewer made a recommendation that  the
    Appellant was a credible entrepreneur based on the  evidence  presented
    at interview.  The applicant had answered the majority of the questions
    satisfactorily and was deemed to be  a  credible  entrepreneur  at  the
    interview stage of their application.

The Explanation for Refusal

12.   Following  the  interview  the  caseworker  considered  the  documents
    submitted by the Appellant and the answers given by  her  in  interview
    before formulating the  refusal  letter.  The  Respondent  refused  the
    application pursuant to paragraph 244DD(i)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    because she was not satisfied that the Appellant genuinely intended and
    was able to establish, take over or become a director of  one  or  more
    businesses in the following six months or that the Appellant  genuinely
    intended to invest the money required by Table 4 of Appendix A  in  her
    business.  The Table 4  funds  were  not  genuinely  available  to  the
    Appellant.

13.   Paragraph  244DD  provides  that  the  Respondent  must   assess   the
    application on the balance of probabilities and may take into  account:
    the evidence the Appellant has submitted; the viability and credibility
    of the source of the Table 4 funds and the Appellant's  business  plans
    and market research into their chosen business sector; the  Appellant's
    previous educational and business experience  (or  lack  thereof);  the
    Appellant's immigration history and previous  activity  in  the  United
    Kingdom; whether any necessary registrations etc.  have  been  obtained
    and any other relevant information.

14.  The Respondent's objections were as follows:

    (i)  Funds

         (1)  The Appellant had provided Barclays  Bank  statements  in  the
             name of AMS London Limited for the period 2nd December 2013 to
             9th May 2014 (that is to say up  to  approximately  two  weeks
             before she submitted the application).  She  also  supplied  a
             third party declaration from her mother  confirming  that  her
             mother would make �75,000 available  to  the  Appellant.   The
             Respondent was satisfied that the required funds in excess  of
             �50,000  were  held  in  the  Appellant's  Barclays   business
             account.  What the Respondent was not satisfied about was  the
             source of those funds nor that all of the money was  available
             for investment or would be used for investment in  a  business
             in the United Kingdom.

         (2)  The Respondent noted that the opening balance of the  Barclays
             Bank account on 2nd December 2013 was just over  �60,000.   By
             28th March 2014 that balance had reduced to �12,794.30 due  to
             large sums of money being paid out of  the  account  including
             �30,000 paid to TTM Polymer and �20,000 to  Pine  Valley.  The
             Respondent was not satisfied with the Appellant's  answers  in
             interview to the questions about the relationship between Pine
             Valley Limited and AMS London Limited.  The Appellant had said
             she was appointed as a director of AMS London Limited  on  1st
             March 2014 and made a deposit of  �75,000  into  the  business
             account on 31st  March  2014.   The  Respondent  expected  the
             Appellant to know if the �20,000  paid  back  to  Pine  Valley
             Limited was to pay off a loan.  Further  the  bank  statements
             showed that  the  �20,000  paid  to  Pine  Valley  was  for  a
             marketing campaign.  Given  that  the  Appellant  was  already
             working as the company's marketing consultant it was  expected
             that she would know what the �20,000 paid on 28th  April  2014
             to Pine Valley had been for.

         (3)  The Barclays business account showed a receipt of  �75,000  on
             31st March 2014 from Bolzano Trading, a declaration signed  by
             the Appellant's mother said that she sent the �75,000 on  29th
             March 2014 via Bolzano Trading into AMS London Limited's  bank
             account.   However  there  was   no   evidence   beyond   that
             declaration  to  confirm  that  the  Appellant's  mother   was
             connected in any way to Bolzano Trading.  The  Respondent  was
             not satisfied that  the  funds  were  credibly  available  for
             investment in the business.

    (ii) The Respondent questioned the viability  and  credibility  of  the
         Appellant's business plans and market research.  The business  plan
         did not specify any of the financial details one  would  expect  to
         see such as start-up costs, sales forecasts, fees for services etc.
          Of the research the  Appellant  indicated  in  interview  she  had
         carried out, there was no evidence of this research to  show  there
         was a market for her service.  The Appellant had said there were 25
         to 30 companies operating within a five mile radius.  A  search  on
         yell.com  showed  151  companies  offering  marketing   consultancy
         services.

    (iii)    The Appellant had provided two marketing contracts,  one  with
         Brian Thomas Estate Agents Limited dated 21st March  2014  and  the
         other with  Sefron  Door  Banqueting  dated  9th  June  2014.   The
         contracts gave a generic list of services that could be offered  in
         any business and did not specify details of the exact services  the
         Appellant was providing to both clients.   The  marketing  contract
         with Brian Thomas Estate Agents  stated  a  total  agreed  fees  of
         �4,583.30 payable in advance.  This was not a credible figure.

    (iv) No evidence had been  supplied  to  substantiate  the  Appellant's
         employment history as detailed by her in interview.  There  was  no
         evidence she had used  her  post-study  work  leave  to  remain  to
         develop a marketing consultancy service.

The Appeal at First Instance

15.  The Appellant made a statement dated 10th March 2015 in which she  said
    that her mother used a money transfer company office trading as Bolzano
    Trading to transfer the �75,000 to her account.  Her  mother  regularly
    used Bolzano  Trading  as  a  medium  to  transfer  money  abroad  from
    Pakistan.  She had not been asked any questions in interview about  TTM
    Polymer although had she been she would have drawn attention to audited
    accounts which showed that �53,027  was  receivable  from  TTM  Polymer
    Limited and �20,000 from Pine Valley Limited.  The other two  directors
    of the company had invested money in TTM Polymer Limited and lent money
    to Pine Valley Limited.  TTM Polymer was a recycling  company  and  was
    given the �53,000 for investment into recycling projects and had repaid
    �50,000 of that.  The Pine Valley Limited payment was due  to  be  paid
    back by 28th April 2015.

16.  Her business was based in Ilford and her research had found  25  to  30
    similar businesses to her at the time trading in close proximity to her
    own business.  The Home Office figure of 150 taken from  yell.com  took
    into account not only marketing companies in Ilford but also  marketing
    companies further afield including printing companies.  Most  of  these
    companies were registered at personal residences without valid landline
    or fax numbers.

17.  Since joining the company she  had  found  a  new  client,  a  property
    developer who was finding it difficult  to  secure  a  source  for  his
    recently completed development in Harrow, Middlesex.  She marketed  the
    development and managed to locate  a  corporate  buyer  who  agreed  to
    purchase all the flats included in the development.  She secured finder
    fees charged to the corporate buyer of �22,000 along with  a  1%  sales
    commission of �42,958.  This  way  she  gathered  in  �64,970  for  the
    company.  This was paid into the company bank account on  24th  October
    2014 and 20th November 2014 when the deal was completed.

18.  The Appellant's appeal was subsequently allowed as the Judge came to  a
    favourable view of the Appellant's credibility and felt  that  she  had
    met the Respondent's objections.  After hearing  submissions  from  the
    parties I subsequently gave my decision in writing finding an error  of
    law and giving directions that the  Appellant  should  file  and  serve
    admissible evidence bearing in mind the  restrictions  on  postdecision
    evidence in points-based system appeals. That evidence should deal with
    each of the detailed complaints made in the refusal letter.  It was not
    open to the Respondent to take new objections.

The Appellant's Further Submissions

19.  Subsequently the Appellant filed and served a supplementary  bundle  of
    some 75  pages  addressing  the  Respondent's  refusal  letter,  giving
    further evidence about the Appellant's  family  circumstances,  further
    audited accounts, a letter from a property development company, copy of
    the Respondent's evidential  flexibility  policy  and  a  copy  of  the
    Supreme Court decision in Mandalia [2015] UKSC 59.   As  a  preliminary
    issue the further representations stated that the Respondent had failed
    to follow her own policy  entitled:  "Points-based  system:  evidential
    flexibility"  last  updated  August  2014.   The  request  for  further
    information which would lead to  the  application  being  approved  was
    mandatory yet all the Appellant had received were assertions  that  she
    did not meet the Rules.  In Mandalia the Supreme Court  had  said  that
    the process instruction obliged the Respondent first  to  have  invited
    the Appellant to repair the deficit in the evidence in that case.

20.  At paragraph 22 of his determination Judge  Buckwell  had  stated  that
    the Presenting Officer accepted that evidence in  relation  to  funding
    concerns had been provided.  I pause  to  note  here  that  it  is  not
    entirely clear what the Judge meant by that paragraph. Did he mean that
    the Presenting Officer accepted that that was no  longer  an  objection
    being made or merely that the Presenting Officer accepted that evidence
    had been presented in relation to  funding  concerns  although  funding
    concerns still remained?

21.  The Appellant had adduced a reasonable explanation as to  why  she  had
    received the amount paid to her by the estate agents.  It  was  not  an
    estate agent it was in fact a property developer. There  was  a  letter
    from Forest Property Developments Limited dated 1st July 2014 signed by
    Mr Paramjit Singh Padda inviting the  Appellant  to  find  a  corporate
    buyer for his development which consisted of 21 flats in  Harrow  which
    he wanted to sell for at least �4,000,000.  If she were  successful  in
    finding a buyer he would pay her  total  commission  on  completion  of
    �40,000 plus  expenses.   The  Appellant  was  a  genuine  entrepreneur
    running a successful business.

22.  In her second witness statement  she  stated  that  she  had  lost  her
    father on 14th December 2014 but had been unable to return to  Pakistan
    to attend the funeral due  to  the  uncertainty  over  her  immigration
    status.  Her mother had recently been diagnosed with  cancer,  she  had
    been unable because of the appeal to return to provide support  to  her
    mother.  All her money had been invested in AMS  London  Limited  which
    was still trading.  She attached a large number of medical reports  and
    also a report of the directors and eighteen months  audited  management
    accounts for the period 1st May 2014 to 31st October  2015.   This  was
    not admissible as it was postdecision evidence but it  indicated  there
    were two directors, Mr Rasool and the Appellant and that there were two
    directors' loan accounts, one for Mr Rasool in the sum of  �50,000  and
    the other for the Appellant for just under �75,000.

The Preliminary Issue

23.  At the outset of the  hearing  before  me  Counsel  for  the  Appellant
    indicated he relied on the principle of common law fairness as this was
    an unusual case.  The Appellant had been deemed to  be  credible  after
    interview, the Respondent had then carried out  further  investigations
    into  the  application  but  the  concerns  raised  by  those   further
    investigations had not been put to the Appellant and thus she  had  not
    been given the opportunity to deal with them.  Although  the  Appellant
    had been given the right of appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision
    she was prohibited from relying  on  postdecision  evidence.   Had  the
    Appellant's credibility been undermined in interview  this  would  have
    been a weaker point but in the circumstances the Appellant had a  right
    to claim that there had been procedural unfairness.  On this basis  the
    Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the  law,  the  appeal
    should  be  allowed  under  Section  84(1)(e)   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and should remain outstanding  for  the
    Respondent to make a fresh decision.

24.  There was a relevant policy in this case which had been  cited  in  the
    supplementary bundle in  the  version  valid  from  12th  August  2014.
    Before refusing the application the Respondent should  have  considered
    the policy giving the Appellant an  opportunity  to  address  evidence.
    The points taken against the Appellant were relatively trivial and  she
    would have a lot to say about the Respondent's assertions  if  she  was
    given the opportunity.

25.  In response the Presenting Officer submitted that  the  case  of  Ahmed
    [2014] UKUT 00365 was clear as to the approach which the Upper Tribunal
    had to take.  The Upper Tribunal had stated that:

         "Where  a  points-based  application  is  made  and   refused   the
         assessment by the Judge is to be of the material  that  was  before
         the decision maker rather than a new consideration of new material.
          In other words the appeal if it is successful is on the basis that
         the decision maker with the material before him should have made  a
         different decision, not on  the  basis  that  a  different  way  of
         presenting  the  application  would  have  produced   a   different
         decision."

The Oral Testimony

26.  The Appellant adopted the two witness statements whose contents I  have
    summarised  above.   There  was  no  cross-examination.   I  asked  the
    Appellant to clarify her role in relation to the  sale  of  the  flats.
    The Appellant stated that the developer was looking  to  sell  off  the
    whole development but he could not find  anyone.   Estate  agents  were
    selling off individual flats she had no role in  that.   The  developer
    was short on time, he had to return the  bank's  development  loan  and
    needed to sell off the whole block.  She listed a number  of  potential
    corporate buyers but finally the Property Union bought the development.



Closing Submissions

27.  In closing the Presenting Officer relied on the refusal letter  and  in
    particular the authority of Ahmed (see above).  The appeal  had  to  be
    determined on the basis of the  material  before  the  decision  maker.
    Although the Appellant had been found to be credible in  interview  one
    had to take a holistic assessment of the evidence.  There were a number
    of points where the evidence was vague, namely the  reference  to  Pine
    Valley Limited payment said to be from AMS for  a  marketing  campaign.
    Towards the end of the interview the Appellant had shown that  she  did
    not know much about this payment, thought it was a loan agreement.   At
    that time the Appellant was a director.  If the money had been diverted
    to another company she should have been able  to  provide  a  response.
    The response she  did  give  did  not  tally  with  the  Barclays  Bank
    statement that the money was for a marketing campaign.  Why  would  the
    Appellant have not known that?  She  should  have  known  more  details
    about it.  Subsequent evidence about the loan agreement should  not  be
    admitted.

28.  There was a letter of structure in the  business  plan  submitted.   It
    lacked statistical analysis and a real lack of  information  about  the
    market, the product, or any form of financial review or market research
    conducted.  Here was  an  individual  who  claimed  to  have  extensive
    marketing qualifications  but  the  business  plan  lacked  forecasting
    decisions or strategy.  The market was quite flooded already with  such
    businesses.  The contracts provided for Brian Thomas Estate Agents  and
    the banqueting company were identical but there was a lack of  specific
    details in both.  They did not indicate what services the Appellant was
    said to be providing.  The Appellant had not discharged the  burden  of
    proof.

29.  In closing for the Appellant it was submitted that  the  Appellant  had
    dealt with the various concerns of the  Respondent  in  her  statement.
    There had been no request from the Presenting Officer  to  resile  from
    what was said to be a concession recorded  at  paragraph  22  of  Judge
    Buckwell's determination (see paragraph 20 above).  The  Appellant  had
    given credible evidence where the money she had invested had come from.
     I asked Counsel at this point to comment on the  suggestion  that  his
    argument as to unfairness might be taken to mean  that  the  Respondent
    could never write a refusal letter refusing a point-based system appeal
    unless and until the contents of the refusal letter had been put to the
    Appellant for the Appellant's comments.  Counsel  responded  that  this
    situation was different because here the Appellant had been interviewed
    and then further points had been taken against her which had  not  been
    put to her in interview. Under the common law duty of fairness a person
    should have the opportunity to address concerns in a fair manner.

30.  One had to read the business plan  as  it  was.   This  was  not  Price
    Waterhouse Coopers.  Even if there was not enough detail that  did  not
    stop it from being a plausible business plan.  If  the  Respondent  had
    wanted cash flow details she could have asked for that.

31.  No evidence had been submitted by the Respondent as to the  results  of
    the yell.com search regarding the number  of  other  companies  in  the
    area.  The Appellant's own research suggested that there were 25 to  30
    companies.  It was not being alleged that the  Appellant  had  provided
    forged documents.  The Appellant wanted to provide more but she was not
    allowed to.  She was paid a finder's fee and a percentage for  locating
    a buyer for the development.  The phrase estate agents should have been
    "property developers" which was a better description.  It was  said  by
    the Respondent that the fee was too large but how much was  too  large?
    She had given evidence about this work today.   A  complaint  was  made
    about the contracts produced by the  Appellant.  The  Respondent  could
    have contacted those people but that was not done in this case.

32.  At the present time the Appellant had a  business  which  employed  six
    people and had paid tax.  The Respondent could check all of  that  with
    HMRC.  The Respondent's complaints in the refusal  letter  were  unfair
    and did not go to the heart  of  the  matter.   On  the  basis  of  the
    evidence before the Respondent  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules were met.  The Appellant's case should not be  dismissed  because
    someone thought that the business plan should be  a  bit  better.   The
    Appellant was a plausible person managing a business.  She had done her
    level best to address the concerns of the Respondent.  She had made the
    point that in pursuing  this  appeal  she  had  been  unable  to  visit
    Pakistan despite her father's bereavement and now her mother's illness.

33.  Where  there  was  an  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  postdecision
    evidence which was not admissible for points-based system appeals could
    be admitted.  Following the recent Upper Tribunal decision of  Mostafa,
    if an Appellant could show that she  would  have  succeeded  under  the
    Rules that would be a relevant factor in determining  Article  8.   The
    Appellant had a private life in this country.  She employed people here
    and there were benefits to the country.  The fairness point interplayed
    with the proportionality exercise under Article 8.  The  appeal  should
    be allowed.

Findings

34.  The issue in  this  case  is  whether  at  the  date  of  decision  the
    Respondent had before her sufficient  documentation  which  established
    that  the  Appellant  could  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Rules.

35.   The  Appellant  had  been  interviewed  by  the  Respondent  and   the
    interviewing officer had found the Appellant  to  be  credible.   As  I
    indicated in my  reasons  for  setting  aside  the  decision  at  first
    instance, the difficulty with the interview was that the Appellant  had
    made a number of assertions during the course of  the  interview  which
    would have to be subsequently checked.  What might therefore appear  to
    be credible at that stage might on further  perusal  prove  not  to  be
    credible at all.  The interviewer's recommendation that  the  Appellant
    was credible did not therefore bind the Respondent such that in  effect
    that was the end of  the  application  and  a  decision  to  allow  the
    application inevitably followed.

36.  In fact as was submitted to me there were a number  of  points  in  the
    interview where the Appellant was vague.  The Respondent had  a  number
    of concerns even before the interview took place.  The  Respondent  was
    particularly concerned as to why AMS London Limited were paying �20,000
    for a marketing service when they had appointed  the  Appellant  to  do
    just that.  The Appellant was vague in interview as to what this  money
    was for suggesting that it was something to do with the other directors
    before her involvement.  Subsequently the Appellant gave an account  in
    her statement presented for the first instance proceedings that it  was
    an investment in Pine Valley Limited which fell to be  repaid  at  some
    point in the future.  For whatever reason the interviewer did  not  ask
    the Appellant any questions about the other company  to  whom  payments
    had been made namely TTM Polymer but that still left the concern  about
    the Appellant's lack of knowledge about the payment of �20,000 to  Pine
    Valley Limited.

37.   The  Appellant  has  argued  that   the   Respondent's   decision   is
    procedurally unfair since matters have been  taken  against  her  which
    could or should have been raised in interview.  In fact  the  issue  of
    the �20,000 Pine  Valley  payment  was  raised  in  interview  but  the
    Appellant  was  not  able  to  give  an  adequate  answer.   The  clear
    conclusion to be drawn was that although the Appellant  was  registered
    as a director of AMS London Limited she evidently had a very incomplete
    grasp of the company's affairs.  It was fully open to the Respondent to
    take that objection to this application and subsequent evidence setting
    out what the loan was about was  inadmissible.   The  problem  for  the
    Appellant goes further than that, no good reason has been given  as  to
    why the Appellant should have subsequently  acquired  a  more  detailed
    knowledge of what this �20,000 was for than she had at  the  time  that
    she was interviewed.

38.  As part of her application (Appendix H to the Respondent's bundle)  the
    Appellant produced a contract between the Appellant  and  Brian  Thomas
    Estate Agents was dated 21st March 2014f that was to pay her just  over
    �4,000.  The contract does not specify what work she was to do for  the
    estate agents referring instead in general  terms  such  as  discussing
    possible changes that needed to be made  in  terms  of  design,  price,
    packaging, promotion etc.  There was very  little  detail  subsequently
    provided what that was for. The contract stated that the  total  agreed
    fees were �4,580.30 including disbursements payable in advance but made
    no mention of any percentage payments. Instead the Appellant has sought
    to rely on something completely different  namely  a  contract  with  a
    developer to find a corporate buyer for a development of  21  flats  in
    Harrow.  There were two contracts in identical forms neither  of  which
    specified what work the Appellant was to  do  in  practical  terms  and
    neither of  which  took  the  Appellant's  application  further.   Post
    decision evidence from the developer was inadmissible.

39.  The Respondent was concerned as to the provenance of the  �75,000  paid
    into AMS London Limited's bank account by Bolzano Trading.  To link the
    payment to the Appellant it was pointed out that the  Appellant's  name
    was on the advice of the bank statement and that the Appellant's mother
    had made a statement saying that she had sent  the  money  via  Bolzano
    Trading.  The  Appellant's  subsequent  explanation  was  that  Bolzano
    Trading was a money transfer company although no evidence was  provided
    to the  Respondent  to  establish  that.  Whilst  the  Appellant  might
    complain that she was not asked specifically  in  interview  about  the
    details of the monies from her mother, she was evidently aware  of  the
    fact that she needed to explain why the money  had  come  from  Bolzano
    Trading since the Appellant's mother's statement had  referred  to  her
    using this company as  a  means  of  transferring  money.   Beyond  the
    Appellant's assertion and the statement from her mother  there  was  no
    evidence to show who Bolzano Trading was.  It was  reasonable  to  have
    expected at least that to be dealt with at the time of application  but
    it was not.

40.  The Respondent was rightly concerned about  the  poor  presentation  of
    the business plan.  This was in very generic terms, there were a number
    of spelling and grammatical mistakes, for example on page 1 'right' was
    spelt as 'write'.  The Appellant's response in  her  statement  was  to
    give more generic remarks about her work rather than  engage  with  the
    specific concerns of the Respondent.  Thus while the  Appellant  argues
    that she was not given an opportunity prior to decision  to  deal  with
    the Respondent's objections, her comments on the  shortcomings  of  the
    business plan made  in  her  statement  show  that  even  if  given  an
    opportunity in her appeal she did not take it.  These failings are  all
    the more acute since the Appellant  has  claimed  that  she  was  in  a
    position to  advise  clients  on  marketing  which  would  involve  the
    composition of a business plan. That she could not do this for her  own
    business has serious implications for her ability to do  it  for  other
    businesses.

41.  The Respondent was concerned that a large  number  of  companies  of  a
    similar sort were already operating in the Ilford area.  Mr Rasool  the
    Appellant's fellow director had himself been granted leave as a Tier  1
    Entrepreneur the year before the Appellant's application.  Whilst it is
    arguable as to how many other companies there  are  operating  in  that
    part of East London even on  the  Appellant's  own  figures  it  was  a
    substantial number.   What  the  Respondent  was  concerned  about  was
    whether there  was  something  which  indicated  that  this  particular
    business run by this particular Appellant was genuine and viable.   The
    documentation supplied to the Respondent and the Appellant's answers in
    interview which were somewhat vague, led the  Respondent  to  the  view
    that this was not a genuine business application  and  no  points  were
    awarded a view with which I concur.

42.  I do not accept the point made to me in argument that  the  actions  of
    the Respondent were unfair in some way.  As was said by the majority in
    the Court of Appeal in the case of EK (Ivory  Coast)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    1517 at paragraph 33 of EK : "The PBS places the onus of ensuring  that
    an application is supported by evidence to meet the relevant  test  for
    grant  of  leave  to  enter  or  remain  upon  the  applicant  and  the
    Immigration Rules give the applicants fair notice of this".  Further at
    paragraph 29 the Court cited paragraph 45 of Alam [2012] EWCA  Civ  960
    with approval: "The price of securing consistency and predictability is
    a lack of flexibility that may  well  result  in  "hard  decisions"  in
    individual cases but that is not a justification for imposing  on  [the
    Respondent] to conduct a preliminary check of all applications  to  see
    whether they are accompanied by all  of  the  specified  documents,  to
    contact applicants where that is not the  case  and  to  give  them  an
    opportunity  to  supply  the  missing  documents.  Imposing   such   an
    obligation would not only have significant  resource  implications,  it
    would also extend the  time  taken  by  the  decision  making  process,
    contrary to the policy underlying the introduction of the PBS"

43.  It is not reasonable to suggest  that  there  should  be  some  lengthy
    process whereby the Respondent  is  unable  to  refuse  an  application
    without hearing from the Appellant before refusal.  That would make the
    points-based system unduly protracted and for that reason the Court  of
    Appeal have emphasised that the system despite what may be perceived to
    be imperfections needs to be of a relatively robust nature.  It was for
    the Appellant to make her application in the correct form.  It was  for
    her to submit a proper business plan, it  was  for  her  to  have  some
    knowledge of the company's affairs and so be able to understand why for
    example �20,000 had been paid to a particular company.  It was for  the
    Appellant to produce evidence in proper form of the activities she said
    she had performed for the  company.   She  did  not  do  this  and  the
    Respondent was fully entitled  upon  a  careful  consideration  of  the
    application form, the documents supplied and the  interview  to  refuse
    the application for the reasons given which I have set out above.

44.  It was not necessary for the Respondent to  pursue  the  Appellant  for
    further documents.  The case of Mandalia is not of direct relevance  in
    this situation.  This was not a case where the Appellant  had  supplied
    documents but there were some missing from a sequence.  This was a case
    where the Appellant  had  submitted  documents  which  simply  did  not
    establish her claim.  As the Court of Appeal pointed out  in  Rodriguez
    it was not incumbent upon the Respondent to  assist  the  Appellant  to
    perfect her application.  The Appellant was not  able  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of Appendix A in relation to  the  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    application under  the  points-based  scheme  and  the  Respondent  was
    entitled to reject the application  which  she  did.   The  Appellant's
    appeal under the Immigration Rules therefore falls to be dismissed.

45.  In relation to Article 8, the Appellant has only  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom a relatively short time during which her status here  has  been
    precarious.  The Appellant has  established  a  private  life  in  this
    country since she appears to have done some work at  least  for  Oracle
    Limited and that private life would be interfered with by requiring the
    Appellant to  return  to  Pakistan.   That  interference  would  be  in
    accordance with the legitimate aim of  immigration  control  since  the
    Appellant cannot meet the Immigration Rules. The interference would  be
    proportionate since the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the  Appellant's
    private life established at a time when her status here was  precarious
    is afforded little weight by reason of Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

46.  There are no compelling  reasons  why  the  appeal  should  be  allowed
    outside the Rules (it is  not  argued  that  the  Appellant  can  bring
    herself within either Paragraph 276ADE of  Appendix  FM).  She  has  no
    family life in  this  country.  It  is  argued  that  the  company  the
    Appellant works for employs a number of people.  That may well  be  so.
    The issue is whether the Appellant could establish she  was  a  genuine
    entrepreneur with a genuine controlling role in  the  company  she  had
    joined.  This she could not do and it is  difficult  to  see  therefore
    what adverse impact the Appellant's removal to Pakistan would  have  on
    the remainder of the company. Article 8 would only come into play if as
    I have found the Appellant could not meet the Rules. If  she  had  been
    able to meet the Rules the appeal would  not  have  reached  Article  8
    considerations.

47.  The Appellant also complains that due to the restrictions on  her  visa
    she was unable to return to Pakistan  whilst  this  appeal  was  taking
    place.  Had she done so she would have been deemed  to  have  abandoned
    her appeal.  Given that I find her appeal lacked merit, it was a matter
    for her if she nevertheless chose to remain in this country  to  pursue
    it. It cannot in those circumstances be a compelling  reason  to  allow
    the appeal.  I find that the Respondent's decision is proportionate  to
    the legitimate aim pursued and I dismiss this appeal under Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.   I  remake  the  decision  by  dismissing  the
Appellant's appeal.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 7th October  1983.   She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 25th July  2014  to
    refuse her application for further leave to remain in this country as a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  points-based  system.   Her
    appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Buckwell sitting
    at Taylor House on 1st April 2015.  The Respondent appeals against that
    decision with leave. The Appellant was  granted  leave  to  enter  this
    country on 21st March 2011 as a Tier 4 (General)  Student.   Her  leave
    was extended in the capacity of a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  Migrant  on
    6th June 2012 valid until 6th June 2014.  She made her application  for
    further leave as an individual investing at least �50,000 and switching
    from the post-study work route under Tier 1 on 23rd May 2014.

2.   The Appellant stated that a total amount of �84,000 had  been  invested
    in her business AMS London Ltd between March and April 2014. She was  a
    director with the job title of Marketing Consultant.  One contract  was
    supplied  together  with  a  letter  from  a  UK  regulated   financial
    institution with whom a business bank account was held.   Following  an
    interview the assessing officer found the Appellant  credible  but  the
    Respondent refused the application.

3.   The Respondent was concerned at the source of the monies available  for
    the business some said to come from the Appellant's mother as  part  of
    an inheritance. The money had been sent via Bolzano Trading  but  there
    was no evidence that her mother was connected to  that  company.  There
    were concerns about monies which  had  been  paid  out  from  the  bank
    account. �30,000 had been paid to a  company  called  TTM  Polymer  and
    �20,000 to another company called Pine Valley Ltd said to be related to
    the recycling side of her business.  A �20,000 loan was made by  Faizal
    Mahmood who was not  related  to  her.   The  Respondent  expected  the
    Appellant to know if �20,000 had been paid to another company in  order
    to discharge a loan.  Some money appeared  to  have  been  paid  for  a
    marketing campaign which was not found  to  be  credible.    Inadequate
    financial detail was contained in the Appellant's business plan and the
    claimed  research  undertaken  by  the  Appellant  was  not  evidenced.
    Internet searches revealed 151 companies in the vicinity of the area of
    operation of the Appellant  and  subsisting  in  the  same  field.  The
    Appellant had thought there were less than 30. The sum payable by Brian
    Thomas Estate Agents Ltd, �4,583.30, under  a  marketing  contract  was
    considered to be too large an amount as was money paid by Saffron  D'Or
    Banqueting. The Appellant had claimed to have  worked  as  a  Marketing
    Executive for two years with Atlas Bank, but such  employment  had  not
    been substantiated.  The Respondent awarded no points for attributes.

4.   The Appellant told the  judge  in  oral  evidence  that  her  marketing
    experience related well in selling a housing development of  21  flats.
    The agents had not themselves been getting  appropriate  responses  but
    following her work the development was sold.  She had been involved  in
    the marketing.  Annual profits of her business should  exceed  �70,000.
    Her  solicitor  (who  also  appeared  before  me)  submitted  that  the
    Appellant had been found by the Home Office interviewer to be  credible
    and there was a common law duty of  fairness  which  should  have  been
    applied.  The Appellant also maintained a claim in relation to  Article
    8.

5.   At paragraphs 31 to 39 the judge set  out  his  findings  and  reasons.
    The Appellant had not been subjected to  lengthy  cross-examination  by
    the Presenting Officer and the conclusions reached by the  interviewing
    officer confirmed the Appellant to have been assessed  as  credible  at
    the interview stage. That had been the opportunity for  the  Respondent
    to raise all relevant concerns.  The subsequent concerns in the refusal
    letter were without justification.  Funds were genuinely  available  to
    the Appellant.  The Appellant had provided  and  confirmed  during  the
    appeal hearing significant extensive and adequate evidence in  relation
    to her personal qualities  and  abilities.   These  included  a  strong
    record of employment with particular  regard  to  marketing.   All  the
    financial  evidence  which  the  Appellant   had   brought   had   been
    appropriately evidenced  and  supported  in  documentation  before  the
    Tribunal.  The judge found her to be an impressive  witness.   She  was
    clearly an intelligent lady and had already been able to  employ  other
    individuals in her business.  Article 8 factors favouring the Appellant
    outweighed those which might be said to  favour  the  Respondent.   The
    appeal was allowed under both paragraph 245DD and Article 8.

6.   The Respondent appealed against this decision arguing  that  the  judge
    had failed to  give  adequate  reasons.   It  was  necessary  that  key
    conflicts  in  the  evidence  were  identified  and  resolved  so   the
    Respondent could understand why  she  had  lost.   This  duty  was  not
    displaced by the opinion of someone  who  believed  the  Appellant  was
    credible at the interview stage.  The conclusions of the judge did  not
    adequately address the particular points raised by the  Respondent  and
    this was a material error.  Further, the judge's approach to Article  8
    was flawed in that he had failed to take into account the  Respondent's
    policy when considering the  balance  of  interests  under  Article  8.
    There was an inadequate explanation as to why Article 8 was engaged.

7.   The  Respondent  argued  that  there  were  two  separate  stages  when
    considering the application.  First the Appellant had had an  interview
    followed by a summary of the interviewer's impression.  The  caseworker
    then put that together with the other  documents  to  see  whether  the
    Rules were met.   If  one  looked  at  paragraphs  33  and  34  of  the
    determination the  judge  had  said  that  the  Appellant  had  clearly
    established in a careful presentation of her documentary evidence  that
    the funds were available but the Respondent posed the question how  had
    she done that?  The Article 8 challenge was also maintained.

8.   In reply the Appellant's solicitor argued that what  had  happened  was
    in fact a three stage process not a two  stage  risk  assessment.   Not
    everyone was interviewed about their application for leave to remain as
    a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).  Thus the first stage was identifying from the
    application whether there were risks.   At  that  point  the  interview
    occurred.  During the interview which was quite lengthy  the  Appellant
    was asked questions after which  the  interviewer  concluded  that  the
    Appellant was credible.  Points were  not  awarded  for  funds  because
    there was an issue as to the credibility and viability of the business.
     Doubts about the Appellant's business were discussed by Judge Buckwell
    and appeared in his determination.

Findings

9.   The issue in this case  is  whether  the  judge  has  given  inadequate
    reasons  for  his  conclusions,  such  that  the  losing  party  cannot
    reasonably  be  expected  to  understand  why  they  have  lost.    The
    Respondent must show that the complaint of inadequate reasons  is  more
    than a mere disagreement with the result dressed up as an argument that
    there has been an error  of  law.   The  Respondent  wrote  a  detailed
    refusal letter on 25th July 2014 which set out  in  two  closely  typed
    pages the concerns she had about the Appellant's application  following
    the interview. The judge was clearly influenced by  the  conclusion  at
    the end of the interview that the interviewer's assessment was that the
    Appellant was credible.

10.  As the  recommendation  itself  makes  clear  that  is  not  the  final
    decision, the  interviewer  is  only  saying  that  the  Appellant  was
    credible at the interview stage.   The  Appellant's  answers  might  be
    incorrect although appearing credible  when  given  in  interview.  The
    Appellant had said there were only 25 to 30 companies operating in  the
    area whereas  in  fact  as  the  Respondent  discovered  following  the
    interview that there were 151 companies offering marketing  consultancy
    services in Ilford.  The number of  companies  operating  in  the  area
    might or might not be a significant factor.   The  important  point  is
    that the interview is not the end of the process whereby the Respondent
    assesses the application.

11.  The judge  himself  came  to  a  favourable  view  on  the  Appellant's
    credibility and felt  that  the  Appellant  had  met  the  Respondent's
    objections.  The difficulty was that paragraphs 33 and 34  which  dealt
    with the specifics of the Respondent's  objections  were  conspicuously
    brief and I have some sympathy with the Respondent's view that  it  was
    not possible to tell from those paragraphs why the judge felt that  the
    Appellant  had  met  the  objections.   He  referred   to   a   careful
    presentation of the documentary evidence but did  not  state  how  that
    documentary  evidence  met  the  very  specific  concerns   which   the
    Respondent had raised.  The judge summarised the  Appellant's  evidence
    at paragraphs 17 to  19  of  the  determination,  but  did  not  cross-
    reference those paragraphs with the concerns of  the  Respondent,  such
    that it was not possible to see how the  Appellant's  further  evidence
    met the objections.  The judge stated the Appellant had a strong record
    of employment with particular regard to marketing but did  not  explain
    why that dealt with concerns about inadequate financial detail  in  the
    business plan or why claimed research undertaken by the  Appellant  and
    the work experience itself  was  not  evidenced.   The  Respondent  was
    concerned that a contract with a firm of estate agents  was  considered
    to be too large an amount.  The judge did not explain why  he  rejected
    that complaint.  The Appellant had given evidence that she  had  helped
    estate agents to sell 21 flats, but  the  crucial  point  was  why  the
    estate agents should pay such a large amount of money  when  they  were
    already selling what would be clearly desirable properties  in  London.
    The Appellant's answer in cross-examination that  the  agents  had  not
    themselves been getting appropriate responses was  not  evidenced.   It
    was difficult to see why the judge should have accepted such an  answer
    which given the present state of the property market in London appeared
    on the face of it to be somewhat implausible.

12.  The judge gave inadequate reasons why  the  Appellant  could  meet  the
    specific and detailed concerns of the Respondent as  to  the  viability
    and credibility of the business she proposed to establish.  The failure
    to give adequate  reasons  can  amount  to  an  error  of  law  in  the
    circumstances I have outlined above.  I find that to be the case  here.
    A far more detailed and forensic analysis of the evidence was  required
    to indicate why this appeal should have been allowed or  dismissed.   A
    statement that the Appellant was an impressive witness is  not  without
    more sufficient.  Given that it could not be said on the basis of  this
    determination that the Appellant met the Rules, any analysis of Article
    8 would have to be predicated on the basis that the Appellant  did  not
    meet the Rules and this might lead to a  different  assessment  of  the
    proportionality exercise.  I also set that aspect of the  determination
    aside.

13.  To assist the Tribunal on the rehearing  of  this  case  the  Appellant
    should  file  and  serve  admissible  evidence  (bearing  in  mind  the
    restrictions on post decision evidence in points based system  appeals)
    dealing specifically with each and every one of the detailed complaints
    made in the refusal letter and that should be filed and served at least
    fourteen days before the renewed hearing. The judge declined to make  a
    fee award in this case because the appeal  had  been  allowed  "on  the
    basis of evidence additionally presented during the appeal  stage".  It
    is difficult to see from the determination whether the judge  permitted
    the Appellant to submit evidence which post-dated the decision and thus
    was not admissible.  I do not consider that it is appropriate to  remit
    this matter back to the First-tier to be heard again.   A  considerable
    quantity of evidence has already been provided and the issues  can  now
    be narrowed down  to  whether  the  Appellant  can  meet  the  specific
    objections in the refusal letter.  It is not open to the Respondent  to
    take any new objections.  The Judge's findings on credibility  are  not
    preserved.

Decision

    The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and I have set it aside.  The appeal  remains  to
    be substantively reheard at a later date.

    I make no anonymity order as no order was made at first instance.
