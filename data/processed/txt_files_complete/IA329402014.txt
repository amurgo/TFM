For the Appellant:     Mr S Hyder, Simon Noble Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Sreeraman, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on  2nd  June  1982.  Her
    appeal against the decision to refuse leave to remain as a spouse under
    Appendix FM was dismissed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pears  in  a
    decision dated 7th July 2015 and promulgated on 9th July 2015.

2.   The Appellant appealed on the ground  that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    consider the Section 120 notice and permission to appeal was granted by
    Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker on  28th  October  2015  on
    that basis. The Section 120 notice states in summary:  "My  spouse  now
    satisfies the income threshold requirement  from  his  employment.   We
    have attached his last six months' payslips, employment letter and bank
    statement to support that.  Therefore, my application and appeal should
    be granted."

The Judge's Decision

3.   At paragraph 6 the judge stated:
         "At the beginning of the hearing the Appellant's representative and
         I had a discussion and I pointed out that as far as  the  Appellant
         meeting the income requirement, the crucial document was at page 25
         in the Appellant's  first  bundle  saying  that  her  husband  only
         started the relevant job that met the income  requirement  on  17th
         March 2014 which whilst it was before the date of  the  application
         on 26th April 2014 (and there was no doubt on the material produced
         in the original and supplemental bundle that the  income  threshold
         had been met since 17th March 2014) the Rules required by paragraph
         2 of Appendix FM-SE that the requirements were met for a period  of
         six months prior to the date of application.  I lent  Mr  Hyder  my
         copy of the Rules and rose for ten minutes."

4.   At paragraph 7 the judge goes on to state:
         "On my return he accepted with reluctance that he  could  not  meet
         the income requirements and also that  because  2,500,000  BDT  was
         received into the bank account with Bank Asia Ltd on  3rd  February
         2014 and therefore there were not enough savings for  a  six  month
         period to meet the requirements of E-LTRP.3.1."

    The judge found that the Appellant could not satisfy  E-LTRP.3.1.(b)(i)
    and there was no challenge to his conclusions at paragraph 8.

5.   The judge then considered Article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules  and
    concluded that the Respondent had considered all relevant factors  when
    refusing to exercise her discretion outside the Immigration Rules.   In
    any event, the refusal of leave was proportionate.

Submissions

6.   Mr Hyder submitted that the  Respondent  had  failed  to  consider  the
    Section 120 notice and had she done so at the date of hearing then  the
    Appellant would have succeeded in her application. The judge had  erred
    in law in failing to remit the matter to  the  Secretary  of  State  or
    adjourning the matter to allow for a response  from  the  Secretary  of
    State.  In the circumstances, it was unfair for the Respondent  not  to
    deal with the Section 120 notice.

7.   Ms Sreeraman relied on the Rule 24 response which stated  at  paragraph
    3:
         "It is clear that the Section 120 notice dated 29th  December  2014
         appears  to  suggest  that  the  Appellant  now  meets  the  income
         threshold and associated requirements under  FM-SE.  There  was  no
         material error of law given the concession  by  the  representative
         that the income  requirements  could  not  be  met  (paragraph  7).
         Furthermore the Immigration Judge gave full reasons at paragraph  8
         for  rejecting   the   alternative   submissions   given   by   the
         representative  at  the  hearing.  Given  the  concession  by   the
         representative, asserting that the matter should have been remitted
         to the Respondent in the first place is pointless."

8.   Ms Sreeraman submitted that the Section 120 notice sets  out  a  change
    in the circumstances.  However, even if the Respondent  had  regard  to
    the changed position the financial requirements could not be  satisfied
    at the date of  application  and  therefore  the  Appellant  could  not
    succeed.  The Respondent's failure to respond to the Section 120 notice
    was therefore irrelevant and the outcome would have been the same.  The
    Appellant could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

9.   Ms Sreeraman relied on paragraphs 55 to 57 of Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department v  SS  (Congo)  &  Ors  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387.  Ms
    Sreeraman further submitted that this did not support the  exercise  of
    discretion outside the Rules and Article 8  could  not  be  used  as  a
    general dispensing power. The Appellant's remedy  was  to  make  a  new
    application because there was no error of law in the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Relevant Immigration Rules

10.  E-LTRP.3.1. states:
         "The applicant must provide specified evidence,  from  the  sources
         listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of -
         (a)  a specified gross annual income of at least -
             (i)  ï¿½18,600;
             ...",

11.  Appendix FM-SE states:
         "2.  In respect of salaried employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
             paragraph 9 applies), all of the following  evidence  must  be
             provided:
             (a)  Payslips covering:
                  (i)   a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                      application if the person has been employed by  their
                      current employer for at least six months  (and  where
                      paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix does not apply); ...
         4.   In respect of a job  offer  in  the  UK  (for  an  applicant's
             partner or parent's partner returning to  salaried  employment
             in the UK at paragraphs  E-ECP.3.2.(a)  and  E-ECC.2.2.(a)  of
             Appendix FM) a letter from the employer must be provided:
             (a)  confirming the job offer, the gross annual salary and the
                  starting date of the employment which must be within three
                  months of the applicant's partner's return to the UK."

Relevant  case law

12.  Paragraph 57 of SS (Congo) states:
         "In certain of the appeals before us,  the  Respondents  said  that
         improvements in the position of their Sponsors were on the horizon,
         so that there appeared to be a reasonable prospect  that  within  a
         period of weeks or months they would in fact be able to satisfy the
         requirements of the Rules. They maintained that  the  Secretary  of
         State should have taken this into account when deciding whether  to
         grant LTE outside  the  Rules.   In  our  judgment,  however,  this
         affords very weak support for a claim for grant of LTE outside  the
         Rules. The Secretary of State remains entitled to enforce the Rules
         in the usual way, to say that the Rules have not been satisfied and
         that the applicant should apply again when the  circumstances  have
         indeed changed.  This reflects a fair balance between the interests
         of the individual and the public interest.  The Secretary of  State
         is not required to take  a  speculative  risk  as  to  whether  the
         requirements in the Rules will in fact be satisfied in  the  future
         when deciding what to do.  Generally, it is fair that the applicant
         should  wait  until  the  circumstances  have   changed   and   the
         requirements in the Rules are satisfied and then apply, rather than
         attempting to jump the queue by asking for  preferential  treatment
         outside the Rules in advance."

Discussion and Conclusions

13.  It is clear from reading the relevant  paragraphs  of  the  Immigration
    Rules that the Appellant had to show that  the  financial  requirements
    were met for a period of six months prior to the date  of  application.
    The Appellant's husband commenced employment on 17th March 2014 and the
    application for leave was made on 26th April 2014.  The Appellant could
    not  satisfy  the  financial  requirements  set  out  in  paragraph  E-
    LTRP.3.1.(a) and paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE.

14.   There  was  no  error  of  law  in  the  judge's  application  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  and  the  point  was  properly  conceded   by   the
    Appellant's  representative  at  the  hearing  before  the   First-tier
    Tribunal.

15.  The Appellant could not succeed under the alternative point  argued  in
    relation to paragraph 4 of Appendix FM-SE because her partner  was  not
    returning to the UK.   There  was  no  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    conclusion at paragraph 8 that paragraph 4 of Appendix  FM-SE  did  not
    apply in the Appellant's case.

16.  It was argued before me today by Mr Hyder that it was  unfair  for  the
    Respondent not to consider the Section 120 notice as  at  the  date  of
    hearing and that the judge should have either remitted  the  matter  to
    the  Respondent  or  adjourned  the  matter.   However,  there  was  no
    application for an adjournment and the judge has no power to remit  the
    decision to the Respondent to reconsider her decision.

17.  The judge could allow the appeal insofar as the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law, but given that the Section 120 notice was  not
    before the Respondent at the time she made her  decision  refusing  the
    application for leave it cannot be argued that her decision  to  refuse
    leave was unlawful.

18.  There was no unfairness on the part of the  Respondent  and  the  judge
    clearly considered the Section 120 notice at paragraphs 6 and 7 of  the
    decision.  I therefore prefer the argument  of  Ms  Sreeraman  that  it
    would not have made any difference to the Appellant if  the  Respondent
    had indeed responded to the Section 120 notice and the failure to do so
    did not amount to an error  of  law  on  the  part  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.

19.  In relation to Article 8, there was insufficient  evidence  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal   setting   out   exceptional   circumstances   or
    unjustifiable hardship and  the  judge  correctly  concluded  that  the
    Respondent had acted lawfully in refusing to exercise her discretion to
    grant leave to remain outside the Rules.

20.  It is argued in the grounds that the refusal  of  the  application  and
    dismissal of the appeal would result in a simple procedural requirement
    to make a fresh application which would be an unnecessary abuse of time
    and money for the Appellant from which she should be protected by  law.
    Unfortunately, on the basis of what is quoted above at paragraph 57  of
    SS (Congo) that  is  exactly  what  she  has  to  do.  The  Appellant's
    circumstances do not warrant  preferential  treatment  outside  of  the
    Rules.

21.  The judge properly  applied  Section  117B  of  the  2002  Act  in  his
    conclusion that, given the absence of  any  exceptional  features,  the
    public interest  in  maintaining  immigration  control  outweighed  the
    Appellant's right to family life. On  the  facts  asserted  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and following SS (Congo) the refusal of  leave  was
    proportionate.

22.  Accordingly, I find that there was no error of law in the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal dated 7th July 2015 and the Appellant's  appeal
    is dismissed.
