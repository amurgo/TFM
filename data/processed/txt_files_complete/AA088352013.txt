Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Paxton instructed by Virgo Consultancy Services
Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

   1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order made  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
      Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither party  invited
      me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule 14  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan who was born in  1989.   The
      appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2011 with a student
      visa.  His partner ("SM") came to the UK with their infant  son  on  1
      August 2012.  She came from Belgium where she had claimed asylum.   On
      4 September 2012, the appellant claimed asylum.  On 12 September 2012,
      the Secretary of State refused the appellant's application for  asylum
      and made a decision to remove him by way of directions to Afghanistan.



   3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. Following a hearing
      on 20 November 2012, Judge Alakija dismissed the appellant's appeal on
      asylum and humanitarian protection grounds and under Articles 2, 3 and
      8 of the ECHR.  First, the Judge rejected the appellant's  claim  that
      he was at risk of persecution or serious  ill-treatment  from  Islamic
      extremists or insurgents such as the Taliban because he had worked for
      a security  company  in  Afghanistan  ("AGI").   Secondly,  the  Judge
      rejected the appellant's claim to fear the  family  of  his  unmarried
      partner "SM" and the Afghan authorities because  he  and  "SM"  had  a
      child born out of wedlock.  Finally,  the  Judge  concluded  that  the
      appellant's removal would not be a breach of Article 8.

   4. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The
      application identifies 15 grounds upon which it was  argued  that  the
      Judge had erred in law.  On 19 December 2012, the First-tier  Tribunal
      (Judge Davey) granted the appellant permission to  appeal.   Thus  the
      appeal came before me.

   5. Mr Paxton, who  represented  the  appellant,  developed  in  his  oral
      submissions the grounds upon  which  permission  to  appeal  had  been
      sought.  He did so at some length and with some effect because at  the
      conclusion  of  his  submissions,  Mr  Richards  who  represented  the
      respondent indicated that he accepted that  there  were  a  number  of
      errors in the Judge's decision and he  did  not  seek  to  uphold  the
      determination.

   6. In the light of that, I can briefly identify  the  clear  errors  that
      lead me to conclude that the Judge's decision cannot stand.

   7. First, the Judge failed to take into account evidence  relevant  to  a
      core part of the appellant's claim to be at risk on return and to make
      findings on the evidence of one of the appellant's witnesses.

   8. It was the appellant's contention that he worked for a  security  firm
      (AGI).  In support of that, the appellant called two  witnesses  ("SA"
      and "SM") who claimed to have worked  for  AGI  and  stated  that  the
      appellant had worked for AGI.  In addition, the appellant  produced  a
      substantial body of  documentary  evidence  (at  pages  69-98  of  the
      appellant's bundle) in support of his claim to have worked for AGI and
      as a result to have faced in the past (and will do so in  the  future)
      persecution from Islamic extremists.  The appellant also relied  on  a
      DVD which  showed  the  appellant  standing  near  a  vehicle  wearing
      protective clothing such as a flak jacket.

   9. The Judge set out the evidence of one witness ("SA") at paras  11  and
      12.  He set out the evidence of the other witness ("SM") at  para  13.
      As regards "SA" at para 28 the Judge found that he was not credible on
      the basis that he had accepted  in  his  evidence  that  he  had  been
      untruthful about money he had loaned to the appellant.  The Judge made
      no finding in relation to the credibility of "SM".  The  only  further
      reference to either witnesses evidence is found in para 32  where  the
      Judge says:

           "32.  I find it hard to believe that any company  where  it  and
                 its employees maybe under threat are na�ve and  lax  enough
                 to employ people without any security  checks.   Given  the
                 known problems in Afghanistan such a  policy  would  almost
                 certainly be considered to be dangerous and irresponsible."

  10. That is a reference to the evidence of "SA" that he had been  employed
      by AGI on the recommendation of the appellant without security checks.



  11. He dealt with the DVD evidence at para 31.  As regards  the  DVD,  the
      Judge commented:

           "31.  I was shown a DVD in which the  appellant  is  seen  in  a
                 vehicle wearing what appeared to be some sort of protective
                 clothing such as  a  flak  jacket.   I  do  not  find  that
                 particularly surprising given that there are  known  to  be
                 certain potential  dangers  for  persons  working  for  the
                 allies whilst they are working for them and it is likely to
                 be company policy that such clothing should be worn."

  12. It is not entirely clear what point the Judge  is  making  here  other
      than to confirm that the evidence is consistent with  the  appellant's
      claim to have worked for "the allies"  in  the  sense  of  a  security
      company in Afghanistan.

  13. Even if the Judge was entitled not to accept the evidence of "SA",  he
      failed to make any finding in relation to "SM".  It  is  difficult  to
      read any of the Judge's reasons as justifying a finding  that  he  did
      not believe "SM".  That amounted to an error of law.  In addition, the
      Judge clearly failed to take into account  the  relevant  material  at
      paged 69-98 of the appellant's bundle relevant to his  claim  to  work
      for AGI.

  14. Even if the Judge was entitled (as he did in para  32)  to  doubt  the
      evidence  of  "SA"  and  the  appellant  on  the  basis  that  it  was
      implausible that they would be employed without security  checks,  the
      Judge's failure to take into account all the relevant evidence and  to
      make any finding in relation to the supporting  evidence  in  the  DVD
      were material errors of law which make the adverse credibility finding
      unsustainable.

  15. Secondly, as regards the appellant's claim based upon his relationship
      with "SM" and their child born out of wedlock, at para  36  the  Judge
      said this:

           "36.  Whilst there is no evidence to show that the appellant and
                 his partner are married there is also no evidence  provided
                 to show the reason why they could not and indeed  have  not
                 married since they have been in the UK."

  16. Leaving aside that there was evidence that they  were  not  married  -
      namely that of the appellant and "SB" in her witness statement  -  the
      Judge imposed an impossible burden upon the appellant, namely to  show
      that he has not married since he has been in the UK.  It is  difficult
      to see what evidence could be produced to prove  that  negative.   The
      Judge's reasoning is, in my judgement, unsustainable.

  17. Thirdly, in relation to the Article 8 claim, the appellant's case  was
      that "SM" suffered from  mental  health  problems.   At  para  29,  in
      relation to that, the Judge said this:

           "29.  There is no medical evidence before me which  specifically
                 applies to the appellant's  partner.   An  e-mail  with  no
                 patient identification can be given  no  weight  whatsoever
                 and in any event the content of that e-mail would be of  no
                 assistance in assessing  medical  matters  as  far  as  any
                 individual was concerned."

  18. That is a reference to an e-mail found at page 133 of the  appellant's
      bundle.  It is written by  a  "Paul  Jones"  who  is  described  as  a
      "Medical Summariser" at the Cardiff Royal Infirmary.  It is  addressed
      to a representative at Virgo Consultancy. It states as follows:

           "As per telephone call in relation to the patient we  discussed.



           I can confirm the patient has a section 2 form completed  by  Dr
           Andrew Glasgow on Friday 16  November,  this  form  is  for  the
           compulsory  admission  as  an  in-patient  to  a  Mental  Health
           Hospital and as far as we are aware the  patient  has  not  been
           discharged from the hospital as of yet.

           I can also confirm if you wish to have a copy of  the  patient's
           medical notes then a fee of �30 will be incurred."

  19. Whilst it is true that this email does not  identify  the  appellant's
      partner by name it does contain as its subject the follows:

           "Ref:  MOH0075-1-0".

  20. As Mr Paxton pointed out, that is at least consistent with the name of
      the appellant's partner.  He also submitted that if this document does
      not relate to the appellant's partner then it is tantamount to  saying
      that the appellant's legal representatives had  attempted  to  mislead
      the Court.  I accept those submissions.  It was irrational to take the
      view,  in  all  the  circumstances  that  this  document   (which   is
      undoubtedly genuine)  did  not  relate  to  the  appellant's  partner.
      Further, it indicated, as relevant to the Article 8 claim that she was
      subject to compulsory admission under the Mental Health Act 1983.   In
      my judgement, the Judge was not entitled, as he put it in para 29,  to
      give this evidence "no weight whatsoever".

  21. Fourthly, the grounds argue that  the  Judge  refused  to  permit  the
      appellant's Counsel to  ask  the  appellant  questions  following  the
      adoption of his statement, on matters relating to his risk on  return.
      The Judge only permitted Counsel to deal with matters  concerning  the
      appellant's partner's admission to hospital.  Mr Paxton told  me  that
      the Judge indicated that any such evidence had to be produced  in  the
      form of a written witness statement.  The Judge invited  Counsel  (who
      was also Mr Paxton) to do so but he declined as that was not practical
      at the hearing.

  22. It has not been possible to obtain the comments of the Judge who  has,
      since the hearing, retired.  Mr Richards  did  not  seek  to  suggest,
      based upon any record of the Presenting Officer at  the  hearing  that
      the circumstances were other than as Mr Paxton presented them.

  23. In  my  judgement,  there  are  real  difficulties  with  the  Judge's
      approach.  Of course, in an ideal world all evidence-in-chief would be
      presented in the form of written witness statements.   In  this  case,
      the bulk of the appellant's evidence was in that form  and  Mr  Paxton
      wished to raise some further matters which, as  I  understand  it,  he
      felt had not been dealt with in the witness  statement  appropriately.
      Whilst,  in  some  circumstances,  it  might  be  both  practical  and
      reasonable for a Judge to require a further short  additional  witness
      statement to be prepared, that will  not  always  be  the  case.   The
      procedure  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  certainly   sufficiently
      flexible to allow for the oral elucidation of further points not dealt
      with in the witness statement.  Counsel, not attended  by  instructing
      solicitors, may well find it difficult to  take  a  witness  statement
      from  an  appellant  whose  first  language  is  not   English.    The
      difficulties are obvious both in terms of taking the  instruction  and
      ensuring that what is recorded in the written  statement  is  accurate
      and understood by the appellant.  In the circumstances of this appeal,
      I have concluded that it was unfair to  require  a  witness  statement
      rather than allow the appellant to  be  asked  questions  and  provide
      evidence through his oral answers.  However,  even  if  I  were  wrong
      about that, the First-tier Tribunal's decision cannot  stand  for  the
      reasons I have already given.

  24. In these circumstances, I do no need to deal in  any  detail  with  Mr
      Paxton's submission that the proceedings  were  unfair  because  there
      were difficulties with the interpretation (as the interpreter was from
      Iran rather than Afghanistan) and it  was  unfair  for  the  Judge  to
      require the appellant to give his evidence in English and then to make
      adverse credibility findings on the basis of that evidence. Suffice it
      for me to say, that had it been necessary to decide this point I would
      not have accepted Mr Paxton's submissions.   The  Judge  set  out  his
      reasons for continuing that hearing in the way  I  have  described  at
      paras 3-5 of his determination.  I note what the appellant says in his
      witness statement dated 8 May 2013 at paras 39-41 that  he  "felt  the
      greatest stress at having to give his evidence  in  English  and  that
      that had had "an adverse impact on the quality of the delivery  of  my
      evidence". Although the appellant stated, when asked by the Judge that
      he was "not 100%" happy as he had not been  able  to  communicate  the
      responses he wished, none of the Judge's  reasoning  relies  upon  any
      inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence or, as Mr Paxton suggested
      in his submission was the  case,  that  the  Judge  had  assessed  the
      "demeanour" of the appellant.   The  only  reference  in  the  Judge's
      decision is at para 37 where he says:

           "37.  Irrespective of any issues regarding  credibility  due  to
                 the    appellant's    behaviour,    inconsistencies     and
                 discrepancies in his evidence I find that even if I  accept
                 the core of his story is true he  does  not  qualify  as  a
                 refugee. "

  25. Although the Judge said this in para 37, his  earlier  reasoning  does
      not in fact rely upon "the appellant's behaviour, inconsistencies  and
      discrepancies in his evidence".  Indeed  the  weight  of  Mr  Paxton's
      submissions was that the Judge had failed to give adequate reasons and
      make findings on significant parts of the evidence.

Decision and Disposal

  26. For the reasons I have given above, the Judge's  decision  to  dismiss
      the appellant's appeal involved the making of an error of law and  the
      decision cannot stand.  The errors infect both the Judge's decision in
      relation to the appellant's international protection claims  and  also
      under Article 8 of the ECHR.

  27. I was invited to remit the appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal.   Given
      that a de novo hearing is required, and the nature and extent  of  the
      fact finding required, in accordance  with  para  7.2  of  the  Senior
      President's Practice Statements it is appropriate to remit this appeal
      to the First-tier Tribunal in order that the decision can be remade.

  28. Accordingly, the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be
      heard de novo.
