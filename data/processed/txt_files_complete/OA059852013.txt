For the Appellant:     Mr J Babarind, Legal Representative, Hatten Wyatt
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  decision  by  an
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse him entry clearance as the partner of
    a person present and settled here. The First-tier Tribunal did not make
    an anonymity order, and I  do  not  consider  that  such  an  order  is
    warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of India, whose date of birth is 7  October
    1944.  On 23 January 2013 an Entry Clearance Officer in New Delhi  gave
    his  reasons  for  refusing  the  appellant's  application  for   entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of  the  Rules.   He  advanced
    three grounds of objection.

 3. The first was that as evidence of his marriage to his sponsor in  1960,
    he had enclosed any refusal certificate confirming  that  the  marriage
    was solemnised on 3 February 1960, but as he was not of the  prescribed
    age at the time of his marriage, his application to register  it  under
    the Hindu Marriage Act  1955  was  refused.   So  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that the marriage to the sponsor was  legally
    valid.

 4. The second ground of objection was that  he  had  not  shown  that  his
    relationship with his sponsor was genuine and subsisting or  that  they
    intended to live permanently together in the  UK.   His  reasoning  was
    that in 1994 his sponsor applied for a family  visit  visa.   When  she
    travelled to the United Kingdom she immediately sought indefinite leave
    to remain outside the Rules.  She had remained in  the  United  Kingdom
    until she was granted ILR on 25 November  2009.   He  had  provided  no
    evidence at all to demonstrate that they had  had  any  contact  during
    their extensive separation, nor had he explained why he  was  only  now
    seeking to join her in the United Kingdom.  The lack of evidence of any
    intervening devotion or contact during their time apart, or of evidence
    that they had reunited as he claimed, left the Entry Clearance  Officer
    unable to be satisfied that  the  relationship  with  his  sponsor  was
    genuine and subsisting, or they intended to live  together  permanently
    in the UK.

 5. The third ground of objection was  non-compliance  with  the  financial
    requirements.   His  sponsor  was  not  exempt   from   the   financial
    requirements. On the evidence provided, his sponsor had a weekly income
    from her pension of �125.40 per week,  which  amounted  to  �6,520  per
    annum.  She had no other source of income.  In  order  to  qualify  for
    entry clearance, the appellant and  his  sponsor  required  �46,200  in
    savings (shortfall x 2.5  +  �16,000).   The  minimum  balance  in  the
    sponsor's Halifax account pass book in the past six months was  �91.44.
    There was some evidence that he held fixed deposits in India,  but  the
    certificates  provided  did  not  show  funds  that   had   been   held
    continuously for the past six months, and so could not be considered.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Maciel sitting at Hatton Cross
    on 17 March 2014.  Mr Shane of Counsel appeared on behalf of the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  Hatten Wyatt  was  on  record  as  the  appellant's
    representatives, but they did not attend the hearing.  The sponsor also
    did not make a personal appearance.  Instead, Mr Lalli  Sidhu  attended
    court, and handed up a  letter  from  the  appellant's  representatives
    dated 14 March 2014 requesting an adjournment.  They requested a 21 day
    adjournment due to the fact that the appellant's sponsor was unable  to
    attend due to her poor health.  The letter went  on  to  attribute  the
    lateness of the application to the fact that the sponsor  had  been  in
    India since 28 January 2014, and had only arrived back in the UK on  11
    March 2014.  The letter further described Mr  Sidhu  as  the  sponsor's
    registered carer.  The letter, which was  not  received  by  the  court
    service by fax as was suggested  on  the  face  of  the  document,  was
    accompanied by a number of other documents, which the  judge  discusses
    in her subsequent determination.

 7. The judge received evidence from Mr Sidhu.  He said that the doctor was
    aware that the sponsor was required to come to court,  but  the  doctor
    had said he could not give her a  sick  note.   Mr  Shane  opposed  the
    adjournment application, as there was no medical evidence to excuse the
    sponsor's attendance at court.  The judge indicated to  Mr  Sidhu  that
    she was not minded to adjourn,  and  requested  him  to  telephone  the
    solicitors to find out when they could attend.  Mr Sidhu did not return
    to  the  court.   The  judge  later  received   a   letter   from   the
    representatives confirming they did not have instructions to attend  at
    the hearing.  They asked an adjournment be  granted  as  the  issue  of
    whether or not the sponsor was suffering from dementia was  fundamental
    to the outcome of the case, and to her ability to give evidence.

 8. The judge decided to proceed with the hearing in  the  absence  of  the
    sponsor, for the  reasons  given  in  paragraph  5  of  her  subsequent
    determination.  The judge went on to find that the  appellant  had  not
    discharged the burden of proving that he was  validly  married  to  the
    sponsor, or that the marriage was subsisting.  However, she found  that
    the financial requirements of Appendix FM of  the  Rules  were  met  by
    virtue of the fact that  the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  attendance
    allowance, and that this exempted the appellant from proving an  income
    or savings at a certain level. The judge dismissed the appeal under the
    Rules and under Article 8.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 9. On 21 May 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin granted the  appellant
    permission to appeal as it appeared that the judge might not have taken
    full account of all the evidence when considering the  adjournment  and
    the decision.

The Rule 24 Response

10. On 9 June 2014 Mr John Parkinson of the Specialist Appeals Team settled
    a Rule 24 response on behalf of the respondent.  There was no  adequate
    medical evidence to demonstrate that the sponsor was unable to  attend.
    Medical evidence cited did not support the assertion that  the  sponsor
    was physically unable to appear at the hearing, despite being  able  to
    travel to India.  The judge did not procedurally err in proceeding with
    the hearing.  The judge was entitled to apply the weight that she chose
    to the evidence before her.  The grounds did not disclose any  material
    error of law.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

11.  For  the  purposes  of  the  hearing  before   me,   the   appellant's
    representatives filed a  supplementary  bundle  of  documents,  and  Mr
    Babarind sought to have them admitted under Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  Mr Babarind also relied  on  MM
    (unfairness; E & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 105 (IAC), where  a  presidential
    panel ruled as follows:

      i) Where there is a defect or impropriety of a  procedural  nature  in
         the proceedings at first instance, this may amount  to  a  material
         error of law requiring the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to
         be set aside.

     ii) A successful appeal is not dependent on the demonstration  of  some
         failing on the part of the First-tier Tribunal.  Thus an  error  of
         law may be found to  have  occurred  in  circumstances  where  some
         material evidence, through no fault of the First-tier Tribunal, was
         not considered, with resulting unfairness (E&R v Secretary of State
         for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49).

12. I drew the parties' attention to the fact that the judge had  found  in
    the appellant's favour on the financial requirement by reference to the
    evidence as it stood at the date of the  appeal  hearing,  and  not  by
    reference to the circumstances appertaining at the date of the  refusal
    decision.  One of the documents produced by Mr Sidhu at the hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal was a letter from the DWP informing the sponsor
    that she was entitled to attendance allowance.  However, this letter is
    dated 2 September 2013, which was over six  months  after  the  refusal
    decision.

13. I received submissions from  both  Mr  Babarind  and  Mr  Nath  on  the
    implications of the judge's error, and upon the other issues raised  in
    the grounds of appeal and the grant of permission.

14. In MM, the panel considered the governing principles relating to  every
    litigant's  right  to  a  fair  hearing.   The  panel  distilled   four
    principles from R v Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police,  ex  parte
    Cotton [1990]  IRLR  344.   For  the  present  purposes,  it  was  only
    necessary to refer to the third and fourth principles:

         (iii)    Thus, if the reviewing or  appellate  Court  identifies  a
             procedural irregularity or impropriety  which,  in  its  view,
             made no difference to the outcome, the appropriate  conclusion
             is that there was no unfairness to the party concerned.

         (iv)     The reviewing or appellate Court should  exercise  caution
             in concluding the outcome would have  been  the  same  if  the
             diagnosed  procedural  irregularity  or  impropriety  had  not
             occurred.

15.  The panel went on to rule at paragraph [22] as follows:

         We consider it is important to emphasise in appeals of the  present
         kind the criterion to be applied is not that of reasonableness  ...
         the present case is a paradigm of its type.  Judge Levin's  conduct
         at  the  hearing  at  first  instance  was  beyond  reproach.   The
         irregularity which has been exposed is entirely  unrelated  to  how
         the hearing was conducted.  The judge cannot  possibly  be  faulted
         for the non-emergence of the solicitor's letter ... However, as the
         authorities demonstrate clearly, the criterion  to  be  applied  on
         review or appeal is fairness, not reasonableness.

16. The supplementary bundle for the hearing in the Upper Tribunal contains
    the judgment of the High Court of Delhi  in  Lajja  Devi  v  The  State
    [2012] (193)  DLT  619.   Mr  Babarind  relies  on  this  authority  as
    establishing  the  following  proposition,  set  out  in  his  skeleton
    argument:

         In respect of marriage of a female less than 18 years of age  or  a
         male of less than 21 years of age, marriage  is  voidable  and  not
         void.  The marriage will become valid if no steps are taken by such
         'child' within the meaning of Section 2(a) of  the  Prohibition  of
         Child Marriage Act 2002, (under Section 3) seeking a declaration of
         marriage as void.

17. In the covering letter that the Specialist Appeals Team received on  13
    June 2004, the appellant's representatives asked the Specialist Appeals
    Team to state whether they still maintained  the  appellant's  marriage
    was not valid in the light of this decision of the Delhi High Court.

18. The authority was not relied on before the First-tier Tribunal, and  so
    the  judge  is  beyond  reproach  in  not  taking  it   into   account.
    Potentially the authority could be relied on to establish an  error  of
    law, either on the basis outlined in MM or  more  persuasively  on  the
    basis that the law always speaks.  I do  not  however  consider  it  is
    necessary for me to rule on the point, as there are other issues  which
    are in controversy, the resolution of which  is  determinative  of  the
    outcome of this appeal.

19. There was no procedural irregularity in  the  judge's  conduct  of  the
    hearing.  The judge has given adequate  reasons  for  finding,  on  the
    evidence before her, that  it  was  appropriate  to  proceed  with  the
    hearing in the absence of the sponsor.  Her  solicitors  had  indicated
    they had no instructions to attend the  hearing.   At  the  same  time,
    there was no evidence before her to suggest that the sponsor was unable
    to attend court.  Despite seeing  her  doctor  since  her  arrival,  he
    refused to issue a certificate stating she could not attend court.   In
    the circumstances, the sponsor had not provided a good  reason  not  to
    attend the court.  In relation to the issue of  dementia,  it  appeared
    that this had been an historical issue raised which  needed  reviewing,
    and there was no evidence that the outcome of previous assessments  had
    any impact on the sponsor's ability to give evidence.

20. I take into account the additional evidence relating to  the  sponsor's
    medical condition which is contained in the  supplementary  bundle.   I
    find that this evidence only serves to reinforce the findings  made  by
    the judge.  On 20 March  2014  Dr  Moran  of  Pelham  Medical  Practice
    stated:

         This lady attended the surgery on 13 March and again on  18  March.
         She seems to have right sided lower back pain  radiating  down  her
         leg.  I have prescribed some Tramadol for her.   She  also  suffers
         with vascular dementia and hypothyroidism.

21. In retrospect, it was pure speculation on the part of Hatten Wyatt that
    the sponsor's condition of "vascular  dementia"  might  impact  on  her
    ability to give oral evidence.  The suggestion was  not  maintained  in
    argument before me by Mr Babarind, and it is wholly unsupported by  the
    medical evidence which has been provided.  Mr Babarind maintained  that
    the judge ought to have granted an adjournment because of the sponsor's
    mobility issue.  But the judge  was  entitled  to  attach  considerable
    weight to the fact that the doctor had refused  to  issue  the  sponsor
    with a sick note excusing her attendance at  court  to  give  evidence.
    Part of Mr Sidhu's evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that the
    doctor had said he could not provide a report on the sponsor's  medical
    condition as it would take a couple of weeks to do so.  But  no  report
    has since been forthcoming which adds anything to what was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  In short, the medical evidence remains the  same.
    The sponsor has ongoing medical problems, but they are not such  as  to
    impact on her ability to give evidence or to  attend  court.   This  is
    borne out by the fact that the sponsor attended the hearing before  me.
    Even retrospectively, there is no medical evidence to show that she had
    a good excuse for not attending the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

22. While I am prepared to accept that the outcome of  the  appeal  on  the
    issue of subsistence of marriage might have been different if the judge
    had  granted  an  adjournment,  there  is  no   antecedent   procedural
    irregularity or unfairness such as to give rise to  an  error  of  law.
    There is also no merit  in  the  suggestion  that  the  judge  did  not
    adequately consider the documents  in  the  appellant's  bundle  before
    reaching the conclusion that on the documentary evidence the  appellant
    had not discharged the burden of proving that the marriage was  genuine
    and subsisting.

23. The principle of res judicata does not apply in this jurisdiction,  and
    so the adverse finding made by the First-tier Tribunal on the issue  of
    subsistence  of  marriage  will  not  be  determinative  in   a   fresh
    application.  In such an event, the Entry Clearance Officer  will  have
    to treat the application on its  merits,  and  he  will  also  have  to
    recognise that the earlier adverse  finding  was  reached  without  the
    Tribunal having  the  benefit  of  receiving  oral  evidence  from  the
    sponsor.

24. The appeal was doomed to fail in any event due to  non-compliance  with
    the financial requirement.  Although there was no cross appeal  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer against the judge's finding on this issue,  the
    error was a Robinson obvious one and it is  so  stark  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal could not ignore it, particularly when considering whether the
    alleged errors of law on the part of the judge  were  material  to  the
    ultimate outcome.

25. The application for entry clearance was made  on  the  basis  that  the
    sponsor was not exempt from the financial requirements, so the analysis
    conducted by the Entry Clearance Officer in the  refusal  decision  was
    entirely appropriate.  Counsel for the Entry Clearance Officer  rightly
    maintained before the judge that the financial  requirements  were  not
    met.  It appears that the judge went away and of her own motion decided
    that the sponsor was exempt from the  financial  requirements,  as  the
    sponsor was receiving an attendance allowance.  However, she overlooked
    the fact that she had to consider the circumstances appertaining at the
    date of the refusal decision, and not the circumstances appertaining at
    the date of the appeal hearing.

26. The judge's error of law in respect of the financial requirement is not
    however material, as she did not err in law in dismissing the appeal on
    the ground that the appellant had not discharged the burden of  proving
    that the marriage was subsisting.  Accordingly,  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error  of  law  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside and remade.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  contain  an  error  of  law
such that the decision should be  set  aside,  and  the  decision  therefore
stands.  This appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

Anonymity


The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
