                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission a decision of First-
        tier Tribunal Judge Cockrell ('the Judge') promulgated on 23 August
        2019 in which Mrs  Patel's  appeal  was  allowed  on  human  rights
        grounds pursuant to Article 8 ECHR.




Background


     2. Mrs Patel is a national of India born on 1 March  1985.  The  Judge
        records her immigration history noting that  following  service  of
        IS151A form on 1 April 2015 a removal notice was served due to  the
        fact the Secretary of State concluded that  Mrs  Patel  had  gained
        leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  by  deception.   Mrs  Patel
        subsequently applied for leave to remain as the dependent spouse of
        her partner in his Tier 2 (Skilled Worker)  application  which  was
        refused. In August 2016 Mrs  Patel  applied  for  leave  to  remain
        outside the Immigration Rules as the spouse  of  a  settled  person
        which was varied on 28 February 2017 to reliance upon her right  to
        respect of family and private life (10-year route). The application
        was refused by the Secretary of State in a letter dated 11 February
        2019. The appeal against that decision came before Judge Cockrill.
     3. The decision-maker concluded Mrs Patel was not eligible  to  remain
        in the United Kingdom as a partner, parent or child under  Appendix
        FM as her partner was  not  British,  settled,  or  in  the  United
        Kingdom as a refugee or  with  humanitarian  protection  leave  and
        because Mrs Patel lives as part of the family unit with her  family
        member. Under the private life route the  decision-maker  concluded
        Mrs Patel fell for refusal on  the  grounds  of  suitability  under
        section S - LTR 4.2 on the basis she had made false representations
        for the purpose of obtaining a  previous  variation  of  leave.   A
        reference to an application of 31  May  2012  in  which  Mrs  Patel
        submitted a TOEIC  certificate  from  Educational  Testing  Service
        (ETS). The decision-maker states that Mrs Patel's scores taken from
        the test on 17 April 2012 at the Synergy Business College of London
        have been  cancelled  by  ETS  leading  the  decision-maker  to  be
        satisfied that Mrs Patel fraudulently obtained her certificate  and
        used deception in the application of 31 May 2012.
     4. The decision-maker considered paragraph  276ADE(1)(iii)  but  noted
        Mrs Patel had only lived in the United Kingdom for 8  years  and  1
        month at the date of the application and it was not  made  out  she
        could satisfy the required minimum period of  20  years  continuous
        residence. It is  also  not  accepted  Mrs  Patel  will  face  very
        significant obstacles to integration into India.
     5.  Thereafter  the  decision-maker  considered  whether   exceptional
        circumstances had been made out sufficient to warrant  a  grant  of
        leave  pursuant  to  article  8  but  found  no  such   exceptional
        circumstances existed in her case for the reasons set  out  in  the
        Refusal  letter.  The  decision-maker   took   into   account   the
        appellant's child pursuant to section 55 Borders,  Citizenship  and
        Immigration Act 2009 noting the child was  born  in  the  UK  on  8
        January 2013 but was not a qualifying child. It was therefore found
        any interference with a protected right will not be contrary to the
        best  interests  of  the  child  and  was  proportionate   to   any
        interference.
     6. The matter came before Judge Cockrell sitting at Taylor House on  6
        August 2019 who sets out findings of fact between [27 - 34] of  the
        decision under challenge in the following terms:


        27.   This  appellant  faces  the  allegation  that  she  had  used
             deceptive means in order to gain a  TOEIC.   I  have  set  out
             already the point that the burden of proof does lie  upon  the
             respondent and the 3 stage process that needs to be undertaken
             when analysing a case of this nature.


        28.  What is critically important in this appeal is that  Mr  Malik
             has made plain that this issue of whether or not the appellant
             submitted a fraudulently obtained TOEIC by using  a  proxy  to
             sit the test has already been  determined  by  this  Tribunal.
             Reference in that regard is made to the decision of the  First
             Judge in relation to the appellant's husband and the  specific
             findings of fact made by that First Judge. What is  also  very
             important indeed to understand in the context of  this  appeal
             is that the findings were quite emphatic that  the  respondent
             had not discharged the  burden  and  deception  had  not  been
             shown.


        29.  The only point really made on behalf that the respondent by Mr
             Nath is that I should pay regard to the  report  of  Professor
             French. Mr Malik responds to that  by  emphasising  that  that
             report  predated  the  decision  of  the  First  Judge  by   a
             considerable degree and that no proper  explanation  has  been
             provided as to why it was not forthcoming  before  that  First
             Judge.


        30.  Already in this document I have set out  in  some  detail  the
             relevant authorities to which my attention was very  helpfully
             drawn by Mr Malik. The conclusion that I reach is  that  those
             findings of fact made by the First Judge in relation  to  this
             appellant are a suitable and proper starting point for  me  on
             conventional Devaseelan principles. What is also important  to
             stress is that nothing has really been added before  me  which
             would enable a different conclusion to be reached properly.


        31.  I am guided by the case law to which my attention  was  drawn,
             notably the decision in Mubu, and further then  the  Court  of
             Appeal decision in BK (Afghanistan). In  the  light  of  those
             authorities it seems to me that the conclusion that has to  be
             drawn in the circumstances is that  the  factual  findings  of
             that First Judge are to be maintained, as of course that means
             inevitably that the appellant succeeds in her appeal.


        32.  For the avoidance of any doubt, I was not  provided  with  any
             explanation at all by Mr Nath  as  to  why  that  report  from
             Professor French had not been  made  available  to  the  First
             Judge.


        33.  In this case there was no application made  for  an  anonymity
             direction and  no  such  direction  was  made  by  me  in  the
             circumstances.


        34.  In conclusion, therefore, I adopt the findings of fact made in
             relation to this appellant by that  First  Judge  and  in  the
             circumstances her appeal is allowed. It is  allowed  on  human
             rights grounds (Article 8).


     7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal asserting, inter
        alia, the Judge made a material error of law in allowing the appeal
        by  default  without  fully  considering  any  evidence  from   the
        appellant and in not allowing the Secretary of State to  prove  her
        case. The grounds assert the Judge  failed  to  take  into  account
        witness statements provided in support of the allegation Mrs  Patel
        had exercised deception by the use of  a  proxy  to  undertake  the
        English language test. The grounds  assert  on  the  basis  of  the
        material  provided  the  Secretary  of  State  had  discharged  the
        requisite evidential burden which fell to the appellant to offer an
        innocent explanation which has not occurred in  this  case.  It  is
        asserted  the  Judge  erred  in  failing  to  appreciate  that  the
        evidential burden had been met. The application for permission also
        asserts there was no good reason to allow the appeal under  article
        8.
     8. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal on 17 December 2019 on the basis it is said to be arguable
        that the Judge has not considered in adequate detail  the  evidence
        submitted by the Secretary of  State  which  was  absent  from  the
        spouse's earlier appeal, and  the  Judge  simply  relied  upon  the
        earlier judgement which was based on the lack of documentation then
        produced.




The written submissions



     9. The Secretary of States initial submissions:


        WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR OF LAW INTRODUCTION:


         1.   The SSHD asks the Tribunal  to  admit  this  document  as  the
             SSHD's  written    submissions  in  response   to   the   UT's
             directions.
         2.   The SSHD refers to Mrs. Patel as the Appellant ("A") for  ease
             of reference with the FtT decision.


         THE SSHD'S SUBMISSIONS ON THEGROUNDS OF APPEAL:


         3.   The SSHD has laid out two Grounds of Appeal  in  the  document
             dated 2nd September 2019 relating to the FtT's application  of
             Devaseelan and the later findings  in  respect  of  Article  8
             ECHR.
         4.   In respect of Ground 1, the SSHD asks the  UT  to  treat  this
             document as laying out the  particular  ambit  of  that  legal
             challenge.
        5.   The SSHD respectfully asserts that the FtJ  did  not  lawfully
             apply the Court's decision in The Secretary of State  for  the
             Home Department v BK (Afghanistan) [2019] EWCA Civ 1358 ("BK")
        6.   The ratio of that decision is laid out at �39& �44: "There has
             been some discussion in the cases about  the  juridical  basis
             for the Devaseelan guidelines. The authorities are clear  that
             the guidelines  are  not  based  on  any  application  of  the
             principle of res judicata or  issue  estoppel.  The  Court  of
             Appeal in Djebbar referred to  the  need  for  consistency  of
             approach. The Court of Appeal in AA (Somalia)  v  SSHD  [2007]
             EWCA Civ 1040 also referred to consistency as a  principle  of
             public   law   and   the   well-established    principle    of
             administrative  law  that  persons should be treated uniformly
             unless  there   is   some   valid   reason   to   treat   them
             differently....I do not accept that in addressing the question
             of whether the finding of fact should be  carried  forward  in
             that way, the tribunal is only entitled to  look  at  material
             which either post-dates  the   earlier   tribunal's   decision
             or  which  was  not  relevant   to   the   earlier  tribunal's
             determination. To restrict the second  tribunal  in  that  way
             would be inconsistent   with   the    recognition    in    the
             case   law   that every tribunal must  conscientiously  decide
             the case in front of them. The basis for the guidance  is  not
             estoppel or res judicata but  fairness.  A  tribunal  must  be
             alive to the unfairness to the opposing  party  of  having  to
             relitigate a point on which  they  have  previously  succeeded
             particularly where  the  point  was  not  then  challenged  on
             appeal."
        7.   In this particular appeal  the  SSHD  adduced  a  conventional
             bundle of  material  supporting  the  SSHD's  allegation  that
             deception had been practiced by the A during  the  TOEIC  test
             (17thApril  2012),  see  �8.  The  general  jurisprudence  has
             established that such a bundle of evidence will be  enough  to
             discharge the initial burden, upon the  SSHD,  in  respect  of
             that allegation which then leaves the A in question to provide
             an innocent explanation for the invalidity result.
        8.   It was right for the Judge to note the findings of the FtT  in
             the A's husband's appeal, decided by the FtT on  17th  January
             2019. It is material to note that the FtT's findings  in  that
             appeal  (which  dismissed  the  A's  husband's  appeal)  state
             explicitly that  the  SSHD  did  not  produce  a  conventional
             evidence bundle in  order  to  make  out  the  initial  burden
             against his wife, �20 quoting �36 of the 2019 judgment.
        9.        However,  it  was  simply  incorrect  for  the  Judge  to
             conclude at �30 that: "...What is also important to stress  is
             that nothing has really  been  added  before  me  which  would
             enable a different conclusion to be reached properly."
        10.  The SSHD asserts that it  is  impossible  to  understand  this
             finding -the Judge himself had already noted that the SSHD had
             not presented the formal bundle at the 2019 hearing but had in
             this. For completeness it is plain that the latter finding  of
             the FtT in  2019  [�36  of  that  judgment]  that  the  A  had
             otherwise shown that deception had not been practiced  by  his
             wife was obiter and in any event could not possibly constitute
             a disposal of the issue  where  new  evidence  (recognised  as
             sufficient to make a case of deception in principle) had  been
             admitted in this hearing.
        11.  The decision of the Court in BK is clear that, contrary to Mr.
             Malik's argument (on behalf of the SSHD in that appeal), there
             was no mechanistic approach to the relevance or  admission  of
             evidence at a later appeal hearing,  �44.  As  already  quoted
             above but this time with emphasis: "I do not  accept  that  in
             addressing the question of whether the finding of fact  should
             be carried forward in that way, the tribunal is only  entitled
             to look  at  material  which  either  post-dates  the  earlier
             tribunal's decision or which was not relevant to  the  earlier
             tribunal's  determination. To restrict the second tribunal  in
             that way would be inconsistent   with   the   recognition   in
                the    case    law     that     every     tribunal     must
             conscientiously decide the case in front of  them.  The  basis
             for the guidance is not estoppel or res judicata but fairness.
             A tribunal must be alive to the  unfairness  to  the  opposing
             party of having to relitigate  a  point  on  which  they  have
             previously succeeded particularly where the point was not then
             challenged on appeal."
        12.  The Judge simply says at �32 that the SSHD's Counsel  did  not
             advance an explanation for the evidence, which  pre-dated  the
             2019 appeal hearing, being admitted  now.  The  SSHD  contends
             that this is not a lawful disposal of the issue  as  described
             in BK and reflects the kind of mechanistic assessment rejected
             by the Appeal Court.
        13.  On  the  face  of  that  bare  reference  in   the   judgment,
             it  is  respectfully  contended  that  the Judge  should  have
             enquired with the SSHD's representative as to why the evidence
             was  not  adduced  before  and/or  sought  to  determine  that
             explanation  and  the  overall  fairness  of  admitting   that
             evidence in the  current  proceedings  even  without  specific
             explanation.
        14.  As it stands there is simply no engagement by the FtT with the
             crucial issue  of  fairness,  this  is   especially  pertinent
             where   the   procedural   facts   of   this   case   are,  by
             analogy,  almost identical to that in  Ocampo,  in  which  the
             Court admitted evidence which would otherwise have failed  the
             Ladd & Marshall test, see�38 of BK:


             "The  ability  of  a  tribunal  to   depart,   after   careful
             examination, from a previous conclusion on the facts does  not
             always operate in favour of  the  appellant.  For  example  in
             Ocampo v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1276, [2007] Imm AR  1 the Court
             of Appeal upheld a decision  by  the  tribunal  rejecting  the
             asylum claim of the claimant. This was despite the  fact  that
             before a different tribunal, his  daughter  had  been  granted
             asylum the basis of her father's  flight  from  Colombia.  The
             further evidence  which  the  tribunal  hearing  the  father's
             appeal had considered would not have met the Ladd  v  Marshall
             criteria because it could have been put before the adjudicator
             in the daughter's appeal. The Court held however that  it  was
             right that the tribunal  as  a  matter  of  common  sense  and
             fairness took the evidence into account. Auld  LJ  (with  whom
             Rix and Hooper LJJ agreed) stressed at paragraph 26  that  the
             daughter's status as a refugee was not affected by any finding
             in reliance on new and cogent evidence  that  the  father  had
             lied in supporting her successful appeal  against  refusal  of
             asylum. The flexibility for  the  tribunal  to  take  a  fresh
             decision allowed proper regard  to  be  given  to  the  public
             interest giving effect to a consistent  and  fair  immigration
             policy -the matter should  be  judged,  Auld  LJ   said,   "as
             one  of  fairness  and  maintenance   of   proper  immigration
             control"."

         15.  Additionally, the Judge's findings are inconsistent  with  his
             duty under BK, for  the  failure  to  take  into  account  the
             material fact that  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  in  2019
             dismissed  the  relevant  appeal.  In  order  to  resolve  the
             question of fairness lawfully, the  Judge  had  to  take  into
             account(and  express  this  matter  in  his  reasons)that  the
             previous decision in question related  primarily  to  the  A's
             husband and that it was dismissed with the incumbent fact that
             this would significantly  reduce  the  SSHD's  inclination  to
             appeal bearing in mind the overall result  favoured  the  SSHD
             and the cost to  the  public  purse  of  pursuing  the  appeal
             further. The decision was also only obliquely relevant to this
             appellant -this was also a material, relevant factor. This was
             obviously relevant to  the  fairness  of  the  evidence  being
             adduced in this hearing  and  caused  this  appeal  to  differ
             materially from the circumstances generally dealt with in  the
             jurisprudence and essentialised in BK at  �44:"...A   tribunal
             must  be  alive  to  the  unfairness  to  the  opposing  party
              of   having   to  relitigate  a  point  on  which  they  have
             previously succeeded particularly where the point was not then
             challenged on appeal."
         16.  In respect of Ground  2,  the  SSHD  asserts  that  the  Judge
             plainly erred in automatically  allowing  the  A's  Article  8
             appeal without making any substantive findings, see �34. It is
             again difficult to  understand  how  the  Judge  reached  this
             conclusion with reference to the 2019 FtT judgment  where  the
             conclusion in that decision was  that  the  appeal  should  be
             dismissed on Article 8 grounds. It is to be noted that Counsel
             for the A specifically did not call live evidence, that  being
             the case the A was declining to  be  tested  on  her  evidence
             overall.
        17.  The Judge has also materially erred in failing  to  carry  out
             his duty to decide the material matters in dispute between the
             parties as per  numerous  authorities  including  South  Bucks
             District Council v Porter(2) [2004]  UKHL  33,  [2004]  1  WLR
             1953, at �26.
        18.  The SSHD pointed out in the refusal letter that  the  A  could
             not take the benefit of Appendix FM  of  the  IRs   and   that
             her  claim  for  private  life  was   nonetheless   considered
             under 276ADE(1) (Part 7) and with reference to the exceptional
             circumstances test from caselaw as  expressed  in  the  SSHD's
             policy guidance for private life cases. The Judge erred by not
             considering this aspect of the Rules.
        19.  The A and her husband have not had Leave to Remain in  the  UK
             since 2015 and so are  in  the  UK  unlawfully,  there  is  no
             engagement with this in the judgment nor any application of s.
             117B  of  NIAA  2002.  The  Article  8  conclusion  is  wholly
             unlawful.
        20.  The SSHD asks that the decision of the FtT is set  aside.  The
             SSHD is content for this error of law appeal to be  considered
             by way of written submissions only.

    10. Mr Malik's response:


        Submissions on the issue of error of law


        8.   Mrs Patel respectfully submits that  Judge  Cockrill  made  no
             error of law in allowing her appeal.
         9.   In an earlier appeal (HU/14045/2018), Judge Hodgkinson, in his
             decision promulgated on 17 January 2019, made these  findings:
             [36]  In  the  present   instance   I   reiterate   that   the
             respondent  has  produced no evidence  at  all,  in  terms  of
             seeking to establish that Mrs  Patel  practised  deception  in
              the  taking  of  her  ETS  TOEIC  test in April 2012. He  has
             not produced the bundle  of  documents  normally  produced  in
             these cases which, it  has  been  held,  just  discharges  the
             initial  evidential  burden.   Thus,   neither   the   initial
             evidential burden nor the legal burden  which  lies  upon  the
             respondent   has   been   discharged.   Conversely, Mrs  Patel
             has adduced statement evidence and other evidence contained in
             the appellant's bundle which is consistent with her indication
             that  she  did   not   practice   deception.   [37]   In   the
             circumstances, I conclude that the alleged deception  has  not
             been established. I bear in mind that both the  appellant  and
             his wife had valid leave continuously until they  were  served
             with forms IS151A at the beginning of April 2015 which had the
             effect of revoking their previous leave.  Those  notices  were
             served solely on the basis that the respondent considered that
             Mrs Patel had practised the indicated  deception.  As  I  have
             concluded that such deception  has  not  been  established,  I
             conclude that those notices were wrongly served."
        10.  Judge Hodgkinson, thus, resolved the issue of  dishonestly  in
             favour of Mrs Patel and held that she had not cheated  in  her
             TOIEC test.
        11.  The Secretary of  State  did  not  appeal  Judge  Hodgkinson's
             decision but, despite that clear decision, again, alleged that
             Mrs Patel had cheated in her TOEIC test. Judge Cockrill,  with
             respect, was plainly right to make his decision  by  reference
             to the findings made by Judge Hodgkinson on this issue in  the
             earlier appeal.
        12.  The Upper Tribunal's decision in Mubu and others  (immigration
             appeals - res judicata) [2012] UKUT 00398  (IAC)  provides  an
             answer to the Secretary of State's appeal. In  that  case,  Mr
             Mubu's application was refused by the Secretary  of  State  on
             the basis that he had relied on a false birth certificate. His
             appeal, however, was allowed by the First Tier  Tribunal,  and
             the Secretary of State decided not appeal that decision to the
             Upper Tribunal. Subsequently, the Secretary of  State  refused
             Mr Mubu's application on the same grounds, namely, that he had
             relied on a false birth certificate. There was then a  further
             appeal and the matter came  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.  The
             Secretary of State, just like the present case, had  submitted
             further evidence that was not before the  earlier  First  Tier
             Tribunal that had decided the issue in Mr Mubu's  favour.  The
             Secretary of State sought to rely on that fresh  evidence  and
             asked the Upper Tribunal to depart from the  earlier  judicial
             findings. The Upper Tribunal flatly rejected the Secretary  of
             State's position.
        13.   The  Upper    Tribunal,     at     [49],   cited   Devaseelan
             principles, including, particularly, principle 7,  namely:"(7)
             The force of the reasoning underlying guidelines (4)  and  (6)
             is greatly   reduced   if    there  is    some    very    good
             reason    why    the    Appellant's    failure    to    adduce
             relevant  evidence  before   the   first  Adjudicator   should
             not  be,  as  it  were,  held  against  him.   We  think  such
             reasons will be rare..."
         14.  The Upper Tribunal allowed Mr Mubu's appeal  and  declined  to
             permit issue to be re-litigated holding, at [64],  that  there
             was no explanation as to why the new   evidence   adduced   by
             the  Secretary  of  State  was   not   made  available  during
             the  earlier  First  Tier  Tribunal   proceedings.  The  Upper
             Tribunal, at [64], held: "We are well aware that, in the field
             of public law, finality of litigation is subject always to the
             discretion of the Court  if  wider  interests  of  justice  so
             require. We bear in mind, however,  that  the  nature  of  the
             issue now in dispute between the parties was  the  same  issue
             that was determinative of the appeal before Judge Tipping.  We
             also bear in mind the failure of the  Secretary  of  State  to
             produce all of the relevant evidence  to  Judge  Tipping  that
             ought to  have  been,  or  could  have  been  with  reasonable
             diligence,  made  available  to  him.   In  light   of   these
             considerations we conclude that  the  determination  of  Judge
             Tipping should  be  treated  as  settling  the  issue  of  the
             relationship  between  the  first  claimant  and   Mr   Ernest
             Alletson."
         15.  This applies here with equal cogency.
         16.  Judge Cockrill was obliged to consider whether there was "some
             very good reason"  (adopting  the  words  in  principle  7  of
             Devaseelan) for the Secretary of State not  to  have  provided
             all the  evidence  before  Judge  Hodgkinson  in  the  earlier
             appeal. In this case (adopting the words used in Mubu),  there
              was  a  "failure  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to   produce
             all  of  the  relevant  evidence  to  Judge [Hodgkinson]  that
               ought   to   have   been,   or   could   have   been    with
             reasonable diligence, made available to him".
         17.  The Secretary of State, before  Judge  Cockrill,  provided  no
             explanation whatsoever as to why all the relevant evidence was
             not produced  before  Judge  Hodgkinson.  Judge  Cockrill  was
             obliged, in these circumstances, to allow Mrs  Patel's  appeal
             by adopting Judge Hodgkinson's findings.
        18.   The  Upper  Tribunal's  decision  in  Mubu   and   Devaseelan
             principles, including principle 7,  as  set  out  above,  were
             approved by the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for  the
             Home Department v BK (Afghanistan) [2019] EWCA Civ 1358.
        19.  In Ullah v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]
             EWCA Civ 550, the Court of Appeal reviewed  this  area.  Ullah
             was a case where the First Tier Tribunal found that  Mr  Ullah
             had lived in the United Kingdom continuously for 14 years  and
             allowed his appeal on that  basis.  The  Secretary  of  State,
             subsequently, received fresh evidence showing  that  that  was
             not true and  sought  to  depart  from  the  earlier  judicial
             findings.  The  Court  of   Appeal  reconciled   all   earlier
             authorities  on  the  subject  and  held  that  the  Secretary
             of State can rely on the fresh evidence  and  seek  to  depart
             from the earlier  judicial findings  only   if   the  Ladd   v
             Marshall  test  is  met:  see  [25], [26], [43] and [44].  The
             Ladd v Marshall test, as it well-know, is three-fold,  namely,
             first,  that  the  fresh  evidence   could   not   have   been
             obtained  with   reasonable   diligence   for   use   at   the
             trial, secondly,  that  if  given,  it  probably  would   have
             had   an   important   influence   on   the    result,    and,
             thirdly,  that  it  is  apparently   credible   although   not
             necessarily  incontrovertible.  The first limb of the  Ladd  v
             Marshall  test  reflects  the  language  in  principle  7   of
             Devaseelan, as elucidated and applied in Mubu.
        20.  In the circumstances, Judge Cockrill made no error of  law  in
             finding that Mrs Patel had not cheated in her  TOEIC  test  by
             following Judge Hodgkinson's findings.
        21.  Judge Cockrill's decision  to  allow  Mrs  Patel's  appeal  on
             Article 8 grounds was  plainly  correct  and  consistent  with
             Ahsan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA
             Civ 2009. In Ahsan, at [120], the Court of Appeal held:"... it
              seems  to  me  clear  that  if  on  a  human  rights   appeal
             an  appellant were found not to have cheated, which inevitably
             means that  the  section  10  decision  had  been  wrong,  the
              Secretary  of State would be obliged to deal with him or  her
             thereafter so far as possible as if that error  had  not  been
             made, i.e. as  if  their  leave  to  remain   had   not   been
             invalidated. In a straightforward case, for example, she could
             and should make a fresh grant of leave to remain equivalent to
             that which had been invalidated.  She could also,  and   other
             things  being  equal  should,  exercise  any  relevant  future
             discretion,  if  necessary  "outside  the   Rules",   on   the
             basis  that  the  appellant  had  in   fact   had   leave   to
             remain  in  the   relevant   period    notwithstanding    that
             formally   that   leave   remained   invalidated ..."
        22.  Accordingly, the Secretary of State is obliged put  Mrs  Patel
             into the position she would have  been  in  had  the  cheating
             allegation and earlier decision based upon it not  been  made.
             This will  result  in  "a  fresh  grant  of  leave  to  remain
             equivalent  to  that  which  had  been  invalidated",  and  an
             opportunity to apply  for  further  leave  to  remain  on  the
             premise that Mrs Patel had not overstayed. This had a material
             bearing on the assessment of proportionality under Article  8.
             On Ahsan, the public interest does  not  require  Mrs  Patel's
             removal from the United Kingdom at this stage.  She is in  the
             present position because  the  Secretary  of  State  made  the
             unfounded allegation of TOEIC fraud against her and  issued  a
             removal decision on that basis on 1 April 2015. It is  obvious
             that Mrs Patel's removal from  the  United  Kingdom,  at  this
             stage, would not be justified or proportionate.


        Conclusion


        23.  For all these reasons,  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  respectfully
             invited to dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

    11. The Secretary of States reply:


        FURTHER WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR OF LAW


        INTRODUCTION:


         1. The SSHD asks the Tribunal to admit this document as the  SSHD's
            written submissions in response to Mrs. Patel's written response
            on error. The SSHD continues to rely upon the  existing  Grounds
            of Appeal and the earlier  written  submissions  dated  1st  May
            2020.
         2. The SSHD refers to Mrs. Patel as the Appellant ("A") for ease of
            reference with the FtT decision.


           THE SSHD'S SUBMISSIONS ON MRS PATEL'S RESPONSE:
         3. The SSHD respectfully asserts that the A's  submissions  on  the
            core legal issues arising in the SSHD's Grounds  of  Appeal  are
            misconceived and should not cause the UT to dismiss  the  SSHD's
            appeal.
         4. The SSHD asserts that neither Mubu nor Ullah  provide  a  direct
            answer to the issues which arose in  this  appeal.  It  is  very
            clear that the procedural circumstances in Mubu  and  Ullah,  as
            well as those in the underlying cases such as TB are  materially
            different to those in this case. This is why the  SSHD  did  not
            refer to them in the original written submissions  and  possibly
            why the A did not rely upon them at the FtT(as  far  as  can  be
            understood from the FtT decision).
         5.  In  Ullah,   the   Court   of   Appeal   cite   a   number   of
            authorities  which  deal  with  situations  in  which  the  SSHD
            had taken decisions after an unappealed decision of the Tribunal
            (of the same person) which was contrary to the allowed  decision
            itself, for instance at �31:"This case is, therefore, High Court
            authority to the effect that, in cases where there has  been  an
              antecedent   Tribunal   decision   that   an   immigrant    is
            entitled  to  ILR,  in considering whether to take action  which
            has the effect of  revoking  the  leave,  the  SSHD  must   give
            proper  attention  to  principles  akin  to   those   identified
            for  the  admission  of fresh  evidence  on  appeals  in   legal
            proceedings,  as  set  out  in Ladd  v  Marshall.   If  he  does
            not do so, his decision is liable to be set  aside  on  judicial
            review."
         6. And at �36, in respect of the Court's decision in  Secretary  of
            State for the Home Department v TB [2008] EWCA  Civ  997at  �36:
            "This court dismissed the SSHD's appeal.  Stanley Burnton LJ (in
            a judgment with  which  Rix  and  Thorpe  LJJ  agreed)  said  at
            paragraph 32 this: "32. As a matter of principle, it  cannot  be
            right for the Home  Secretary  to  be  able  to  circumvent  the
            decision of the IAT by administrative decision. If she could  do
            so, the statutory appeal system would be undermined; indeed,  in
            a case such as the present,  the  decision  of  the  Immigration
            Judge on the application of the Refugee Convention would be made
            irrelevant.  That  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  statutory
            scheme. "He then referred to R (Mersin) v SSHD [2000]  EWHC  348
            (Admin)  and  to  Boafo  (from  the  latter:  "...an  unappealed
            decision of an adjudicator is binding on the parties"). He  also
            quoted the judgment of Moses J in Saribal (supra)  at  paragraph
            17 (quoted above) where "the principle" was that the SSHD is not
            entitled to disregard an adjudicator's decision "unless  he  can
            set aside that determination by appropriate procedure founded on
            appropriate evidence"."
         7. It is important to note that the  Court  do  not  refer  to  the
            decision of the Court of Appeal in The Secretary  of  State  for
            the  Home  Department  v  BK    (Afghanistan)[2019]   EWCA   Civ
            1358("BK") which,  by  its  reliance  upon  Ocampo,  has  direct
            relevance to  the  circumstances  of   this   appeal-  this  has
            already   been   argued   by   the   SSHD   in    the    written
            submissions document at para. 14 and won't be repeated here.
         8. The SSHD reiterates that the finding made  by  Judge  Hodgkinson
            was in a dismissed appeal of the A's husband, it  was  therefore
            not a decision which led to either the A  or  her  husband  (the
            appellant) gaining Leave to  Remain  or  any  other  substantive
            benefit in the UK. There was therefore no later decision by  the
            SSHD which sought to undo the substantive benefit of a  previous
            positive  and  unappealed  decision   of   the   Tribunal.   The
            circumstances are entirely different to those in Ullah  and  the
            underpinning authorities.
         9. The SSHD has already argued that there were significant  reasons
            why the SSHD would not have appealed a decision which was in her
            favour - the A's husband's appeal was dismissed. Not only  would
            there have been significant reason for the SSHD not  seeking  to
            appeal because the Tribunal decision nonetheless meant that  the
            A and her husband could not  remain  in  the  UK (or  could   be
            removed)  and  that  such  an   appeal   would   have   led   to
            further, unnecessary public expense but it is fairly clear  that
            permission would never have, in principle, been given.
        10. The SSHD wishes to add that, in light of the recent decision  of
            the Court of Appeal in The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
            Department v Devani [2020] EWCA Civ 612("Devani"), there was  in
            fact no power for the SSHD, as the winning party at the FtT,  to
            appeal under the statutory scheme (SSHD's underlining):  "27.  I
            start with the alleged failure by the Secretary of State herself
            to appeal. I agree with  Mr  Chapman  that  there  was  no  such
            failure. In my view Mr Tufan was quite right in  his  submission
            to DUTJ Latter (see para. 16 above) that  that  course  was  not
            open to her because she was (ostensibly) the winning  party.  As
            appears from para. 17 of his decision,  the  Judge  acknowledged
            that that had once been the law, but he said that  the  position
            was changed by section 11  (2)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
            Enforcement Act 2007,  which  reads  "Any  party  has  a   right
            of  appeal,  subject  to  subsection   (8)[3]."  Subsection  (1)
            defines a right of appeal, so far as relevant,  as  a  right  of
            appeal to the UT on a point of law. I accept that on  a  literal
            reading subsection (2) could be construed as giving a  right  of
            appeal not only to a party against whom an order has  been  made
            but also to a party who has obtained, as regards that order, the
            exact outcome that they sought:  although  usually  the  winning
            party would have no wish to appeal,  occasionally  they  may  be
            dissatisfied with particular findings made by the Court or  with
            aspects of its reasoning (the present case,  if  the  slip  rule
            were unavailable, would be an example albeit of a very  specific
            kind). But for the winning party to have a right  of  appeal  in
            such a case  would  be  contrary  to  well-established  case-law
            governing the position in the common law courts, which  reflects
            important policy considerations; the authorities are well-known,
            and I need only refer to the commentary in para. 9A-59.3 of  the
            White Book. It was not suggested to us that there was any reason
            why Parliament should have intended a different approach in  the
            case of appeals to the Upper Tribunal. Ms  Broadfoot  sought  to
            support DUTJ Latter's conclusion by reference to the decision of
            the UT in EG and NG (Ethiopia) [2013] UKUT   000143  (IAC),  but
            that was not concerned with the present point at all. I am  sure
            that section 11(2) of the 2007 Act is intended to confer a right
            of appeal only against some aspect of the actual  order  of  the
            FTT, and that the phrase "any party" must be read  as  referring
            only to a party who has in that sense lost.[4]"
        11. The SSHD  has  already  argued  that  the  FtT  failed  in  even
            considering the issue as relevant to the fairness  of  admitting
            the deception bundle of evidence. The SSHD  now  adds  that  the
            Tribunal was obliged to take into account that the SSHD  had  no
            statutory avenue to  contest  the  finding  that  there  was  no
            deception.
        12. The SSHD therefore adds that  the  decision  in  Devani  further
            emphasises  the  material  difference  between  the   procedural
            circumstances in cases such as Mersin and TB.
        13. Ultimately, whether viewed  through  the  prism  of  the  SSHD's
            argument in this case or the A's, the Judge did not engage  with
            this kind of nuanced assessment of fairness at  all.  He  simply
            treated the question of the admission of the deception  evidence
            as being a simplistic, binary  question  -  the  procedural  and
            qualitative context has been ignored and fairness therefore  not
            applied.
        14. The SSHD state further contends that the A's  assertion  in  the
            written submissions that the FtJ  was obliged   to   allow   the
            appeal because the  Presenting  Officer  was   said   not   have
            offered an explanation for the absence of the deception evidence
            in the previous FtT hearing (of  the   husband)(para.   17)   is
            plainly incompatible  with  the  holistic  fairness   assessment
            described in BK,  Ocampo  and  in  the  general  authorities  in
            respect of the flexibility to be applied by the Tribunal to  the
            Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1  WLR  1489test,  see  BK  but  also  JG
            (Jamaica) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department[2015]
            EWCA Civ 215 at �9:  "Mr    Dunlop,    on    behalf    of    the
            Secretary   of   State,   submits   that   the Ladd   v Marshall
            principles should be applied less strictly in public  law  cases
            such as this. In support of that proposition he relies upon  the
            decision of the Court of Appeal in E and R v Secretary of  State
            for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49; [2004]  QB  1044  at
            paragraphs 79 to 81.  For my part I accept the proposition  that
            the Ladd v Marshall principles  are  applied  less  strictly  in
            public law cases. Indeed Mr Gill, who appears for the  appellant
            and opposes this part of the Secretary of  State's  application,
            also accepts that the Ladd v  Marshall  principles  are  applied
            less strictly in public law cases..."
        15. This is reflected in the highly flexible nature of the  evidence
            Rules in the FtT Procedure Rules.
        16. In respect of Ground2, in light of Mr. Malik's arguments in  his
            written submissions by reference to �120 of Ahsan, and the  fact
            that the A was not called to give evidence at the FtT, the  SSHD
            proceeds on the basis that the A is not arguing that she or  her
            husband have any other reason under the Article 8  IRs  to  gain
            Leave to Remain in the UK.
        17. If that is correct then the SSHD accepts that in  light  of  the
            decision of the Court in Ahsan, and  later,  in   the  form   of
            relief given  in Khan  &  Ors  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the
             Home Department [2018]  EWCA  Civ   1684,   that  if   the   UT
            reject  the  SSHD's  challenge  to  the FtT's  approach  to  the
            deception evidence, then the A will be given not  less  than  60
            days to make  a  further application  for   Leave   to   Remain.
            The Article 8 decision by the FtT is therefore, in  that  sense,
            sustainable.


      DISPOSAL OF THE APPEAL:


        18. The SSHD respectfully contends that the authorities cited by Mr.
            Malik about the importance of oral argument in the  English  and
            Welsh legal system are not in dispute,  the  question   remains,
            under  the  current  circumstances,  and  bearing  in mind   the
            particular circumstances thrown up by the current  pandemic,  is
            there a particular potential unfairness caused by the  error  of
            law hearing being considered on the papers?  The  SSHD  contends
            that no reason has been given which indicates that  there  would
            be any unfairness to the A. Both parties  have  been  given  the
            opportunity to provide detailed written submissions and there is
            flexibility inherent in the system and timelines should there be
            a need to exercise it.
        19. The SSHD asks the UT to allow the SSHD's appeal  and  set  aside
            the decision of the Tribunal for a remote hearing at the FtT.

Error of law


    12. It is necessary when determining the merits  of  the  Secretary  of
        State's claim to step back to the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Hodgkinson promulgated on 17 January 2019 which dismissed the
        appeal of Mrs Patel's husband, Mr Sanikumar Patel, on human  rights
        grounds. That is the decision considered by the  Judge  to  be  the
        starting point in determining Mrs Patel's appeal.
    13. Judge Hodgkinson set out the relevant history of Mr  Patel  between
        [2 - 13] noting at [6 - 7]:


        6.   Mrs Patel claims to have taken the took an Educational Testing
             Service (ETS) TOEIC English speaking and writing test and,  on
             20 April  2012,  she  claims  to  have  taken  a  reading  and
             listening tests. The respondent now asserts that  she  used  a
             proxy test taker  and  that,  as  a  result,  the  application
             referred to in the following  paragraph  of  my  decision  was
             based on deception.


        7.   On 31 May 2012,  the  appellant  was  again  included  as  the
             dependent on his wife's  in  time  application  for  leave  to
             remain as a student. Leave was granted to both of  them  on  1
             August 2012, valid until 10 April 2015.


    14. Judge Hodgkinson records an  adjournment  application  having  been
        made by Mr Williams the Home Office  Presenting  Officer  appearing
        before him which was opposed by Mr Gajjar who represented Mr Patel.
        Judge Hodgkinson notes at [29 - 33]:


        29.  At the commencement of the hearing, Mr Williams  requested  an
             adjournment,  for  the  reason  that  Mrs  Patel  was   varied
             application of January 2017 remained outstanding.  Mr Williams
             indicated that it would be sensible for  both  appeals  to  be
             heard together  and  to  await  the  outcome  of  Mrs  Patel's
             application accordingly.  However,  Mr  Williams  acknowledged
             that it was unclear as to when any decision might be  made  by
             the respondent in relation to Mrs Patel and I noted,  and  was
             aware, that are varied application was  made  nearly  2  years
             ago; in January 2017.


        30.  I noted with Mr Williams that the respondent had not filed his
             usual bundle of documents, relating to  generic  and  specific
             evidence of relevance to Mrs Patel's alleged deception in  the
             taking of the ETC  TOEIC  test  in  April  2012.  Mr  Williams
             acknowledged that no evidence had been lodged to  support  the
             allegation of deception but contended that  this  was  another
             reason why it was important for Mrs Patel's application to  be
             determined by the respondent, and for any appeal made  by  her
             then to be linked to that of the appellant. Mr Williams  noted
             that the alleged deception related to Mrs Patel,  and  not  to
             the appellant, he appearing to indicate that this  was  by  no
             "ETS bundle" had been filed in relation to the current appeal.


        31.  I indicated to Mr Williams that there was no good reason why a
             relevant evidential ETS bundle had not been filed, bearing  in
             mind that the appellant's application had  been  refused,  and
             his leave revoked in  2015,  because  of  his  wife's  alleged
             deception. I note that the deception was relied  upon  in  the
             RFRL. Consequently, I took the view that  there  was  no  good
             reason  why  a  relevant  evidential  bundle,  concerning  Mrs
             Patel's alleged deception, had not been produced.


        32.  In the circumstances, and also bearing in mind that Mr  Gijjar
             oppose the requested adjournment, I was satisfied  that  there
             was no  good  reason  to  adjourn  the  appeal  and  that  the
             respondent had an obligation to produce relevant evidence upon
             which he intended to rely, and yet had failed to do so. I also
             bought in mind that, to  adjourn  the  current  appeal,  could
             potentially be for an indefinite period of  time,  bearing  in
             mind that the respondent had already been in possession of Mrs
             Patel's outstanding application  for  nearly  2  years,  there
             being no indication as  to  when  that  application  might  be
             determined.


        33.  In the circumstances,  I  was  satisfied  that  no  unfairness
             resulted from my refusal of the adjournment application.


    15. Judge Hodgkinson set out findings of fact from [34] of the decision
        under challenge  dealing  with  the  issues  concerning  Mrs  Patel
        between [36 - 37] in the following terms:


        36.  In the present instances, I reiterate that the respondent  has
             produced no evidence at all, in terms of seeking to  establish
             that Mrs Patel practice deception in the  taking  of  her  ETS
             TOEIC test in April 2012. He has not produced  the  bundle  of
             documents  normally  produced  in  these  cases  which,   just
             discharges the ineffectual evidential  burden.  Thus,  neither
             the initial evidential burden, nor  the  legal  burden,  which
             lies upon the respondent has been discharged. Conversely,  Mrs
             Patel has  reduced  statement  evidence,  and  other  evidence
             contained in the appellant's bundle, which is consistent  with
             her indication that she did not practice deception.


        37.  In the circumstances, I conclude that the alleged deception is
             not been established. I bear in mind that both  the  appellant
             and his wife had valid  leave  continuously  until  they  were
             served with forms IS151A at the beginning of April 2015, which
             had the effect of revoking their previous leave. Those notices
             were served solely on the basis that the respondent considered
             that Mrs Patel had practised the  indicated  deception.  As  I
             have concluded that such deception has not been established, I
             conclude  that  those  notice  notices  were  wrongly  served.
             Nevertheless, the fact is that  those  notices  remain  valid,
             even though I conclude that they should not have  been  served
             in the first place, and they had the effect  of  revoking  the
             leave of the appellant and his wife.


    16. The Judge Hodgkinson dismissed Mr Patel's appeal  on  human  rights
        grounds, notwithstanding the above  findings  appertaining  to  Mrs
        Patel, on the basis that having taken into account the totality  of
        the  evidence  there  were   no   exceptional   and/or   compelling
        circumstances which warranted a grant of leave to  Mr  Patel  under
        Article 8 outside the Rules.
    17. Judge Hodgkinson's decision was not successfully appealed by either
        party, and there is merit in the submission by Mr Bates that as the
        successful party the Secretary of State  had  no  right  of  appeal
        against the decision in any event.
    18. Although Judge Hodgkinson claims the Secretary  of  State  did  not
        provide any reasons for not providing the  evidence  a  reason  was
        given, namely that the appeal before that tribunal  related  to  Mr
        Patel and not Mrs Patel although there was  clearly  an  evidential
        relationship between the assertion Mrs Patel has used  a  proxy  to
        take English language test and the reasons for the rejection of  Mr
        Patel's application, but that explanation was not accepted by Judge
        Hodgkinson.
    19. It also does not appear from the  decision  that  Judge  Hodgkinson
        gave any consideration to the developing jurisprudence in  relation
        to ETS cases which would have impacted upon any application made in
        2017 and may have explained the delay in making  a  decision  on  a
        2017 application.
    20. R (on the application of Gazi) v SSHD (ETS-JR) was decided in  2015
        (2015 UKUT 00327). SM and Qadir (ETS - Evidence - Burden of  Proof)
        in 2016 ([2016] UKUT 229 (IAC). Qadir on appeal  to  the  Court  of
        Appeal in 2016 ([2016] EWCA Civ 1167). KS (India) v  SSHD  in  2018
        ([2018] EWCA Civ 836). Shehzad and Chowdhury in 2016  ([2016]  EWCA
        Civ 615). R (on the application of Mohibullah) v Secretary of State
        for the Home Department (TOEIC - ETS - judicial review  principles)
        in 2016 ([2016] UKUT 561 (IAC)). Khan and others  in  2018  ([2018]
        EWCA Civ 1684).
    21. The ever changing jurisdictional landscape in relation to ETS cases
        at the time did arguably support the Secretary of States  delay  in
        making a decision,  which  was  not  specifically  found  by  Judge
        Hodgkinson to be a period of delay that was unlawful, between  2017
        and the date of the hearing before the judge.
    22. The approach to be taken by a tribunal to earlier findings of  fact
        made in a determination relating to a different party,  such  as  a
        family member, but arising out of the same factual  matrix  is  now
        established. In AA (Somalia) v SSHD and AH  (Iran)  v  SSHD  [2007]
        EWCA Civ  1040  the  Court  of  Appeal  said  that  the  Devaseelan
        guidelines extended to cases where the  earlier  decision  involved
        different parties and  where  there  was  "a  material  overlap  of
        evidence" in the sense of matters arising out of the  same  factual
        matrix. The first Adjudicator's decision was  not  binding  in  the
        sense of issue estoppel but was the  starting  point  and,  in  the
        interest of good administration, should be followed unless  a  good
        reason was advanced to the contrary.  The Court of Appeal said that
        there must be a material overlap of evidence, rather than  just  an
        overlap; that the second Tribunal should have regard to the factual
        conclusions of the first Tribunal; but  that  the  second  Tribunal
        still had to evaluate the evidence as it would in  any  other  case
        and independently decide the second case on its own  merits.   (See
        Ocampo v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1276).  However, the Court of  Appeal
        also said that in applying the guidelines to such  cases  involving
        different claimants, there could be a valid  distinction  depending
        on whether the previous decision was in favour of  or  against  the
        SSHD.  In the former case the SSHD would have been a  direct  party
        to the first decision whereas the litigant would not.  It would  be
        unfair to impose a restriction on re-litigating an issue on someone
        who, although involved in the previous case, perhaps as a  witness,
        had not formally been a party. In AA(Somalia) v SSHD 2007 EWCA  Civ
        1040  the  litigant  had  not  produced  the  earlier  decision  or
        specifically sought to rely on it and the Court of Appeal said that
        the IJ had not erred in law in  failing  to  take  account  of  the
        contents of a decision not before him.
    23. Mrs Patel was not a party to the appeal before Judge Hodgkinson.
    24. In Mubu and others (immigration appeals - res judicata) [2012] UKUT
        00398(IAC) the Tribunal stated that the principle of  res  judicata
        does not operate in immigration appeals. The guidelines set out  in
        Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702; [2003] Imm AR 1  are  always  to  be
        applied to the determination of a factual issue, the dispute as  to
        which has already been the subject of judicial determination in  an
        appeal against an earlier immigration decision involving  the  same
        parties.  This  is  so  whether  the   finding   in   the   earlier
        determination was in favour, or against, the Secretary of State.
    25. The Court of Appeal in Ullah v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ  550  discussed
        the principles in TB [2008] EWCA  Civ  997  that  as  a  matter  of
        principle it could not  be  right  for  the  SSHD  to  subvert  the
        tribunal's   decision   by   administrative   action.     Different
        considerations might apply where there was fresh evidence which had
        not been available at the hearing, or a change in the law  and  the
        principle was of  no  application  where  there  was  a  change  in
        circumstances or new events after the  date  of  the  hearing.   In
        discussing those principles the Court  of  Appeal  considered  that
        Ladd v Marshall  principles  would  have  to  apply  to  the  fresh
        evidence.
    26. In SSHD v BK (Afghanistan) [2019] EWCA Civ 1358 the Court of Appeal
        went through the Devaseelan principles again, explaining the  cases
        and stressing the importance of not allowing the guidance to  place
        unacceptable restrictions on the second  adjudicator's  ability  to
        determine the appeal in front of him.  As a matter of practice, the
        tribunal must address its mind to the reasons put  forward  by  the
        party which is seeking to depart from the previous findings  as  to
        why that finding is unreliable so that it should not in  effect  be
        carried forward into the determination of the appeal now before it.
         In addressing the question whether the finding of fact  should  be
        carried forward in that way,  the  second  tribunal  could  not  be
        restricted to material post-dating the first tribunal's decision or
        which was not relevant to the decision.   To  restrict  the  second
        tribunal in that way would be inconsistent with the recognition  in
        the case law that every tribunal must  conscientiously  decide  the
        case in front of them.  The basis for the guidance is not  estoppel
        or res judicata but fairness.  A tribunal  must  be  alive  to  the
        unfairness to the opposing party of having to relitigate a point on
        which they have previously succeeded particularly where  the  point
        was not then challenged on appeal. On  the  particular  facts,  the
        Court of Appeal found that the "procedural features" of  the  first
        decision  (there  had  been  no  asylum  interview,  or  a  witness
        statement, the grounds for refusing asylum had been  non-attendance
        at interview)  coupled  with  the  difficulty  of  identifying  the
        evidence on  which  the  first  adjudicator's  finding  was  based,
        entitled the Upper Tribunal to depart from the  starting  point  of
        the first decision and make their own assessment  of  the  evidence
        before them.
    27. I also note that in AL (Albania) v SSHD [2019]  EWCA  Civ  950  the
        Court of Appeal held that the approach to be taken by a tribunal to
        earlier findings of fact made in  a  determination  relating  to  a
        different party, such as a family member, but arising  out  of  the
        same factual matrix is now established.  In AA  (Somalia)  Carnwath
        and Ward LJJ (Hooper LJ dissenting) held, applying Ocampo, that  in
        such a case the guidelines given by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal
        in Devaseelan apply. Those guidelines begin with the  premise  that
        the first tribunal's determination should be  the  starting  point.
        Evidence contradicting a core aspect of the appellant's claim was a
        good reason for departing from that determination.
    28. In the current case there does not appear to  have  been  a  proper
        evaluation by Judge Cockrill of the above stated case law or proper
        application of the principle of  fairness  in  the  decision  under
        challenge.
    29. The material provided by the Secretary  of  State  in  the  current
        appeal included not only  the  generic  evidence  in  the  form  of
        witness statements by Peter Millington  and  Rebecca  Collings  but
        also the Lookup tool relating to Synergy Business College of London
        showing for the relevant period 4894 tests  having  been  taken  of
        which 51%, 2484, were questionable and 49%, 2410, were invalid with
        a specific printout showing that the test  results  for  Mrs  Patel
        have all been adjudged to  be  invalid.  There  is  also  a  report
        specifically relating to the Synergy Business College.
    30. In Shehzad and Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 it was held that where
        the Secretary of State provided prima facie evidence of  deception,
        the burden shifted onto  the  individual  to  provide  a  plausible
        innocent explanation, and if  the  individual  did  so  the  burden
        shifted back to the Secretary of State. In effect it was held  that
        a screenshot of the results which stated that that was the position
        and included the "ETS Lookup Tool" which showed the tests that were
        categorised as "invalid" sufficed to discharge the initial burden.
    31. There was clearly evidence before Judge Cockrill to show  that  the
        Secretary of State could discharge the  initial  evidential  burden
        which contradicted the core aspect of Mrs  Patel's  claim  and  the
        finding of Judge Hodgkinson, that she had not employed a  proxy  or
        used deception in the obtaining of  the  earlier  English  language
        tests.
    32. I find  in  all  the  circumstances  the  Secretary  of  State  has
        established error of law material to the decision of Judge Cockrill
        to allow the appeal on article 8 grounds as it has not  been  shown
        the  correct  test  was  properly  applied  in  relation   to   the
        consideration of the evidence, namely  that  of  fairness,  by  the
        Judge. As the findings in relation  to  ETS  certificate  has  been
        shown to be infected by material legal error  the  failure  of  the
        Judge to examine article  8  ECHR  in  sufficient  detail  is  also
        material.
    33. In light of the lack of fairness in the decision of Judge  Cockrill
        resulting in procedural errors in the manner in  which  the  appeal
        was considered I find it appropriate in all the  circumstances,  as
        discussed at the hearing, to remit the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
        Tribunal sitting at Taylor House to enable another  judge  of  that
        Tribunal to consider the merits of  the  ETS  issue  and  how  that
        impacts, upon the appeal pursuant to article 8 ECHR  on  the  facts
        and in law. There shall be no preserved findings.

Decision

    34. The First-tier Judge materially erred  in  law.  I  set  aside  the
        decision of the original Judge. I remit the appeal  to  the  First-
        tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House to be heard by a judge  other
        than Judge Cockrill.


   Anonymity.


    35. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
