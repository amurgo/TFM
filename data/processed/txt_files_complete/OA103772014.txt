Representation:
For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery - Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Mrs Anum Asif, a  citizen  of  Pakistan  born  7th
    November 1991.  She appeals against the decision of the Entry Clearance
    Officer  made on 12th August  2014  to  refuse  entry  clearance  under
    paragraph 319C(g) of the Immigration Rules as the partner of  a  person
    in the UK under the Points-based System.

 2. The appeal was initially heard by a First-tier Tribunal Judge in  April
    2015.  He allowed the appeal.  The  Respondent  appealed  against  that
    decision and on 12th August 2015, having heard submissions I found that
    there was a material error of law in the determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and I set that  decision  aside.   The  Sponsor  did  not
    attend that hearing and the Presenting Officer was unable  to  give  me
    any information about the whereabouts of the Sponsor, whose  leave  had
    been due to expire on 13th October 2014.  The case was relisted to give
    the Sponsor the opportunity to put his wife's case to the Tribunal  but
    again there was no appearance on  7th  October  2015.   I  was  however
    advised by Mr Avery that Home Office records  show  the  Appellant  had
    been granted entry clearance to join her husband on 1st April 2015.

 3. I therefore treat the appeal in this case has having been abandoned.


Signed   Date: 18th October 2015

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
