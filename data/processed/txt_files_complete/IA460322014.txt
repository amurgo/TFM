                            DECISION AND REASONS
                             EXTEMPORE JUDGMENT

 1. The Appellant appeals a decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated
    on 12th March 2015.   The  judge  found  that  the  Appellant  had  not
    satisfied him that he met the requirements of the  points-based  system
    Rules which are referred to in the respondent's reasons for refusal  as
    being set out at paragraph 245ZX(a) and  (d).  The  Grounds  of  Appeal
    assert that  in  reaching  that  conclusion  the  judge  conflated  the
    evidence concerning an earlier application with the Appellant's current
    application and failed to appreciate that he relied on funds  from  his
    father held abroad and the funds that were  held  in  the  Access  Bank
    account were sufficient to meet the requirements of the  Rules,  namely
    that he should hold or have access to ï¿½1,600  rather  as  reflected  in
    bank statements lasting 28 days between 14th  November  2012  and  11th
    December 2012, the date of the relevant application.

 2. In the grant of permission the granting judge points out that the  bank
    statements  upon  which  the  Appellant  relied  were  treated  by  the
    Secretary of State as being unavailable to the Appellant on  the  basis
    that they were false and the allegation of falsehood was  supported  by
    an email from the bank which merely  stated  that  the  documents  were
    incorrect. The grounds contend that the evidence was  insufficient  for
    the Respondent to establish that the documents were false and  that  in
    any event the judge failed to make any finding as to whether or not the
    bank statements were in fact false or not.

 3. The Secretary of State contends that  the  judge's  failure  to  decide
    whether or not the bank statements were false  does  not  amount  to  a
    material error of law, because even if those statements were found  not
    to be false they were inadequate to establish that  the  Appellant  met
    the financial requirements of the Rules because they  did  not  satisfy
    the evidential requirements of the points-based  system  as  they  were
    unsupported by the necessary corroborative evidence.

 4. Before me Mr Maqsood reluctantly conceded that the application did  not
    contain any of the necessary corroborative  evidence  and  although  he
    made a gallant effort  to  persuade  me  that  I  should  look  at  the
    discretionary powers under Rule 245AA and decide  that  the  Respondent
    should have exercised those powers in  order  to  seek  the  additional
    evidence, he readily recognised that that was an approach which did not
    stand scrutiny in light of recent jurisprudence about  the  limitations
    of the Rules set out at 245.

 5. Reading the judge's decision it is clear that this was a case which was
    not assisted by the fact that neither the Appellant nor the  Respondent
    were before him, that was of course a matter or a position which  arose
    as a result of the Appellant's request that his appeal should be  dealt
    with in his absence, and so merely on the papers.

 6. In  that  context  the  Appellant's  Grounds  of  Appeal  were  grossly
    inadequate in terms of the complaints which are now raised  in  respect
    of the judge's decision.  It is quite clear that  the  Appellant  could
    not establish as at the date of decision or  application  that  he  had
    supported his application by the relevant documentation in  respect  of
    his father's bank account to the point that even if the Respondent  had
    not considered it false, the evidence  was  insufficient  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.

 7. It is also  apparent  from  the  decision  that  the  judge  gave  some
    consideration to that issue at paragraph  10  although  nowhere  is  it
    clearly set  out  as  to  precisely  what  corroborative  evidence  was
    required.  That  of  course  does  not  detract  from  the  point  that
    absolutely  none  was  provided.   Accordingly  no  error  of  law   is
    established in respect of the Judge's consideration and decision on the
    points based decision.

 8. The second limb of the appeal before me  relates  to  the  respondent's
    second basis of refusal: that relating to the general ground of refusal
    on the  position  of  the  false  statement.   The  burden  is  on  the
    Respondent in regard to that, and it is apparent on  the  face  of  the
    judge's decision that the  complexities  of  that  position  have  been
    overlooked. The  judge  self-directs  in  respect  of  the  burden  and
    standard of proof at paragraph 7 referring only to paragraph 245ZX, and
    makes no reference to paragraph 322, and the  different  position  that
    arises there and was in error in failing to do so. The judge's decision
    is flawed by error and the matter I have to decide is what to do  about
    it.

 9. I find that it is appropriate for me to set the decision aside  and  to
    remake it.

10. In connection with the requirements of paragraph 245 I am satisfied for
    the same reasons set out above, the Appellant has failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules in respect of the evidence necessary to  show
    that he meets the financial requirements under Appendix C when  relying
    upon third party financial support from abroad.

11. So far as paragraph 322 is concerned, the burden is on  the  Respondent
    to show that the document produced is false. I am  satisfied  that  the
    respondent had not met that burden. The email at  E  of  the  documents
    before me, which refers to the  documentation  submitted  to  the  bank
    manager as being incorrect, falls short, I find, of  establishing  that
    the documents are false.  That of course does not mean that I find that
    the documents are necessarily reliable but because of the fact that the
    documents are in any event insufficient to meet the requirements of the
    Rules there is no need for me to reach any conclusion beyond the  issue
    of  the  Respondent's  failure  to  meet  the  burden  in  respect   of
    establishing falsehood.

Notice of Decision

12. The Appellant's appeal before me is successful to  the  limited  extent
    that the FtTJ's decision  on  paragraph  322  is  set  aside,  but  the
    Appellant's appeal on Immigration Rules grounds relating  to  245ZX  is
    dismissed.
