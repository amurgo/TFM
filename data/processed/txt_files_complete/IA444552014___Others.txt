                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                            James Mwuara Njuguna
                            Jane Wanjiku Karumbo
                               Sanchez Karumbo

                               Scholes Karumbo
                                                                 Respondents


                             NOTICE OF DECISION

 1. The Secretary of State brings an appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  against
    the decision of FTTJ Shergill, allowing the appellants' appeals  against
    decisions to remove them from the UK. Permission to appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted on the 22 September 2015.

 2. The Secretary of State has, by letter dated 13  November  2015,  granted
    the appellants leave to remain outside of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
    appellants' section  82  appeals  are  consequently  to  be  treated  as
    abandoned pursuant to section 104(4A) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 from the point in time that the grant of  leave  was
    made.

 3. This, however, does not bring the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal
    to an end.  The Secretary of State has not withdrawn her appeals  before
    the Upper Tribunal, and although they  have  attempted  to  do  so,  the
    Respondents cannot withdraw the appeals because  they  have  no  appeals
    before the Upper Tribunal.

 4. Given the circumstances of these appeals it is prudent for the  Tribunal
    to bring the proceedings to an  end  and  I  do  so  by  dismissing  the
    Secretary of  State's  appeals  in  the  above  referenced  cases.  Such
    decision is no reflection on the merits of the case, which  I  have  not
    considered - it is made in order to dispose of the  appeals  which,  for
    the reasons given above, have become unnecessary.




    Signed
