                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Ghana, date of birth  28  April  1972,  had
    appealed against the Secretary of State's decision, dated 14 July 2015,
    to refuse leave to remain.  The  refusal  was  with  reference  to  the
    Immigration Rules (the Rules), particularly Appendix FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE of the Rules.

3.   The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian (the  Judge),
    who on 22 August 2016 appears to have  refused  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and to have allowed the  appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds.  He also made a fee award of ï¿½140.

4.    On  12  December  2016  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Landes  gave  the
    Secretary of State  permission  to  appeal,  identifying  a  number  of
    arguable errors of law.

5.   It is trite  law  but  both  parties  to  an  appeal  are  entitled  to
    sufficient and adequate reasons.  In this case the Secretary  of  State
    says that the judge failed to properly consider the application of  the
    Rules and whether or not the Claimant had fallen outside of the  Rules,
    had misunderstood elements of the law in  relation  to  the  length  of
    stay: Although that is not evidently material to  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal Further the judge had failed to properly take into  account  and
    apply, as he was required,  Sections  117A  -  B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended.

6.   I agree with the Secretary of  State  that  the  judge  fails  to  give
    adequate reasons as to why he concluded that Appendix FM did not apply;
    although on the face of it it appears it might well not  have  done  in
    any  event.  More  importantly  the  judge   fails   to   address   the
    considerations under Section 117B of the NIAA 2002, in  particular  the
    public interest and  the  issue  of  how  that  sat  with  the  judge's
    consideration of the general merits of the claim.

7.   I am satisfied  therefore  that  there  is  a  lack  of  sufficient  or
    adequate reasons to properly explain why Article 8 ECHR was engaged and
    in the event the  Secretary of State's decision was not compliant.

8.   The judge's assessment of proportionality is simply inadequate.   I  do
    not consider that had the decision been more felicitously expressed  it
    would have made any difference and neither do I accept  the  submission
    that  in  effect  the  Secretary  of  State's  challenge  is  really  a
    disagreement with the adverse findings made against  the  Secretary  of
    State's case.  It seems to me that this case having been heard at least
    in some detail must be remade.

9.   Accordingly, as the Original Tribunal's decision  does  not  stand  the
    matter will have to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal. The appeal to
    be remade de novo with no findings of fact to stand unless they are not
    disputed or the Tribunal otherwise directs.

DIRECTIONS

(1)  List for hearing two hours. Not before F-t T J Andonian.

(2)  No interpreter required.

(3)  Any additional documents relating to the Article 8  ECHR  claim  to  be
    served not less than seven working days before the further hearing.

(4)  All additional statements to be served not less than seven days  before
    the date of rehearing.

(5)  The issues are the following:

    1.   The applicability of the application with  reference  to  Appendix
         FM;


    2.   The period of the Claimant's stay in the United  Kingdom  and  her
         immigration history and


    3.   Article 8 ECHR considerations.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed. The matter is to be  remade
in the First-tier Tribunal.
