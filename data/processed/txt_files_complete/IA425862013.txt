Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr Slatter instructed by Richmond Chambers LLP
For the Respondent: Mr Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant,  a  national  of  Russia,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State  to  refuse  to
    issue him with a permanent residence card under regulation  15  of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006   (the   EEA
    Regulations). First-tier Tribunal Judge Denson dismissed the appeal and
    the appellant now appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 2. The background to this appeal is that  the  appellant  entered  into  a
    civil partnership with a French national on 8 January 2008 and  he  was
    issued with a residence card valid from 13 March 2008  until  13  March
    2013. The relationship broke down as a result of domestic violence  and
    the civil partnership  was  dissolved  on  29  July  2013.  It  is  the
    appellant's case that his former partner has been self-employed in  the
    UK since 2007 and was, in addition, employed between 2007 and 2009. The
    appellant submitted documents  in  relation  to  his  former  partner's
    employment and self-employment to the respondent and further  documents
    were submitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the evidence produced did  not
    demonstrate that the appellant's former partner was  exercising  treaty
    rights in the UK prior to the dissolution of the civil partnership. The
    appellant had submitted his former partner's tax returns for the  years
    2009 until 2014. However the Judge found that the  tax  returns  showed
    that the appellant's former partner received no income in  relation  to
    his self-employment for the period 6 April 2012 to  5  April  2014  and
    that he was not therefore engaged in any form of self-employment during
    that period.

 4. The grounds of appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  contend  that  the  Judge
    misread the tax returns. It was submitted that the  appellant's  former
    partner was an artist and musician and that he did not make any  income
    in relation to sales of his artwork and music but that the supplemental
    pages of the tax return for 2011-12 did in  fact  show  a  turnover  of
    �3075 during that year. It is contended that the supplemental pages  of
    the tax returns for 2012-13 showed a turnover of �9761 and for  2013-14
    was �7863. It  was  accepted  that  the  2011-12  return  shows  a  low
    turnover. It is  contended  that  Article  49  of  the  Treaty  on  the
    Functioning of the European Union does not require a minimum amount  of
    self-employed earnings in  order  to  establish  activity  as  a  self-
    employed person.

 5. At the hearing before me Mr  Slatter  accepted  that  the  supplemental
    pages for the 2012-13  and  2013-14  were  not  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge. He submitted that the appellant had given these to  his
    solicitor in advance of the First-tier Tribunal  hearing  but  did  not
    realise that they were not in  the  bundle  until  after  the  hearing.
    Despite this I accept that the Judge erred in his reading of the  2012-
    13 tax return. The Judge quotes from that tax return  at  paragraph  25
    where he said that it asked  for  'other  UK  income  not  included  on
    supplementary pages' as nil. In fact this indicates only that there was
    no other income apart from the self-employed income.  The  same  answer
    was misinterpreted in the 2013-14 tax return. The supplemental pages in
    relation to these two years, which I accept were not before the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, show  that  the  appellant's  former  partner  did
    achieve earnings from self-employment during these periods.

 6. Mr Slatter submitted that in any event the Judge erred  in  considering
    it necessary to demonstrate earnings from self-employment to  establish
    that the appellant's former partner  was  self-employed.  He  submitted
    that there is no authority to  support  the  conclusion  that  a  self-
    employed person is required to show a profit for each year of his self-
    employment. Mr Shilliday accepted  that  Mr  Slatter's  submission  was
    right  and  that  the  Treaty  and  Regulations  do  not  require   the
    demonstration of any earnings from self-employed activity. He  accepted
    that there was no evidence of abuse in this case.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal Judge said at paragraph 27 of his determination
    that whilst the appellant's former partner may  have  completed  a  tax
    return as being self-employed 'the fact that he has not been engaged in
    any form of self-employment that would earn an  income  does  not  show
    that he was exercising treaty rights prior to the  termination  of  his
    civil partnership with the appellant...' (my emphasis).

 8. I am satisfied that the Judge erred  in  adding  the  requirement  that
    there had to be evidence of income from self-employment to  demonstrate
    that the appellant's former partner was  exercising  Treaty  rights  by
    pursuing activity as a self-employed person during the relevant period.
    The tax returns and correspondence in relation  to  national  insurance
    contributions do establish that  the  appellant's  former  partner  was
    pursuing activity as a self-employed  person  throughout  the  relevant
    period.

 9. The Judge therefore erred in his treatment of the evidence  before  him
    and in his interpretation of the  Treaty  and  EEA  Regulations  and  I
    therefore set the decision aside and remake it.

10. The appellant was granted a residence card on the basis  of  his  civil
    partnership with an EEA national on 13 March 2008 which was valid until
    13 March 2013. The civil partnership was dissolved on 29 July 2013.

11. I am satisfied on  the  basis  of  the  evidence  before  me  that  the
    appellant's former partner was pursuing activity as an employed or self-
    employed person between 2007 and 2014.

12. The respondent considered this application under regulation 10  and  15
    (1) (f) which apply to  those  with  a  retained  right  of  residence.
    However this case falls within regulation 15 (1) (b) which provides  as
    follows;

      15. (1) The following persons shall acquire the right to reside in the
      United Kingdom permanently-
      ...


      (b) a family member of an EEA national who is not himself an EEA
      national but who has resided in the United Kingdom with the EEA
      national in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period
      of five years;
      ...

13. The appellant has demonstrated that  he  acquired  permanent  residence
    under regulation 15 (1) (b) on 13 March 2013, when his  residence  card
    expired, because by then he had been residing in the UK with his former
    partner for a continuous period of five years.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on point of law.

I set it aside and remake it by allowing the appeal.
