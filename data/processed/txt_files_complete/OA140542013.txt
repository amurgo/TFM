DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not deem it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Devlin after a hearing on 12 March  2014  which  dismissed
   the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.
Background
3. The Appellant was born on 5 May 1982 and is a citizen of Kenya.
4. On 30 April 2013 the Appellant  applied for leave  to  enter  the  United
   Kingdom as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules
5. On 7  May  2013  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  the  Appellant's
   application. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons: The Appellant's
   sponsor was required to show an average gross annual income over the last
   2 years of �18,600; the Appellant claimed her sponsor  earned  an  annual
   income of  �56,050  from  self  employment  but  failed  to  provide  the
   specified evidence as set out in Appendix FM-SE to show  that  he  earned
   that income.
The Judge's Decision
6.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Devlin (hereinafter  called  "the  Judge")  dismissed  the
   appeal  against  the  Respondent's  decision.  The  Judge  set  out   the
   requirements of the Rules relating to the evidence of self employment and
   found that the Appellant had failed to provide the required  evidence  of
   self employment through the payment  of  Class  2  NI  contributions;  he
   rejected the assertion that the Appellant's tax return  could  meet  this
   evidential requirement as he did not accept   that  the  figure  for  tax
   payable  included  national  insurance  contributions;  he  rejected  the
   suggestion  that  the  Respondent  should  have  made  further  enquiries
   requesting this evidence as there was no evidence to suggest that he  had
   paid NI contributions in any other document; in relation to  the  claimed
   income of �55,050 the  Judge  found  that  this  figure  represented  the
   turnover of the business whereas his net profit before tax  was  �16,727;
   he rejected the submission that gross annual  income  was  turnover;  the
   Judge considered whether he should look at Article 8  outside  the  rules
   and did so; he found the decision was not disproportionate.
7. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 29 May 2014 Designated Judge of  the
   First-tier Tribunal J M Lewis gave permission to appeal stating that  the
   grounds were arguable.

8. At the hearing I heard submissions from the Appellant that :

   a) He wished to rely on the grounds of appeal  drafted  by  his  previous
      representatives.

   b)  He  said  that  the  Judge  failed  to  take  into  account  that  he
      additionally received an income of �2500  per  annum  from  a  pension
      which was shown on his Santander bank statements. That if this sum was
      added to the net profit of his business he met the requirements of the
      Rules.

9. On behalf of the Respondent  Ms Johnstone  submitted that :

   a) There was no evidence that the further income of �2500  relied  on  by
      the Appellant was placed before the ECO. In the  visa  application  at
      page 151 of the bundle the Appellant asked only to  be  considered  on
      the basis of the sponsor's income from self employment.

   b) The tax return completed by the sponsor at page 87 made  no  reference
      to any other source of income other than that from self employment.

   c) Even had the Appellant  asked  for  the  sponsors  additional  pension
      income to be taken into account the specified documents required under
      Appendix FM-SE had not been provided.

   d) In relation to the income from self employment the Appellant  had  not
      provided the specified evidence in relation to the payment of Class  2
      NIC.

   e) The Appellant therefore could not meet the requirements of the Rules.

   f) The Judge found that the decision was not disproportionate relying  on
      MM and others v Secretary of State for the home Department [2013] EWHC
      1900 (Admin)

10.  In reply Mr Lamptey stated  that  although  he  only  referred  to  the
   income of �55,000 in the visa application he should have been allowed  to
   demonstrate that he had  other  income.  He  accepted  that  he  had  not
   provided proof he had paid Class 2 NIC as in fact when he contacted  HMRC
   it appeared that they had not collected those payments since 1986-1987.

The Law

11.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
   authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons,  ignoring  material
   considerations by taking into account immaterial considerations, reaching
   irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or   giving   legally
   inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural unfairness, constitute
   errors of law.

12. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give  too
   little weight or too much weight to a  factor,  unless  irrationality  is
   alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge  to  fail  to
   deal with every  factual  issue  under  argument.  Disagreement  with  an
   Immigrations Judge's factual conclusions, his appraisal of  the  evidence
   or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of  risk  does  not  give
   rise to an error of law. Unless  an  Immigration  Judge's  assessment  of
   proportionality is arguable as being completely wrong, there is no  error
   of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge  not  to  have
   regard to evidence of events arising after his decision  or  for  him  to
   have taken no account of evidence that was not before him. Rationality is
   a very high threshold and a conclusion is  not  irrational  just  because
   some alternative explanation has been rejected  or  can  be  said  to  be
   possible. Nor is it necessary  to  consider  every  possible  alternative
   inference consistent  with  truthfulness  because  an  Immigration  judge
   concludes that the story told is  untrue.  If  a  point  of  evidence  of
   significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that is a failure to take
   into account a material consideration.
Finding on Material Error

13. Having heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made no material errors of law.

14.  The Appellant made an application for entry clearance as a  spouse  and
   the application was refused on the basis that  the  Appellant  could  not
   meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM as she  had  not  provided
   the specified evidence of  the  income  from  self  employment  that  was
   claimed for the sponsor.

15. In a detailed and thorough determination the Judge in  this  appeal  set
   out the evidence and law that was relevant to the application.

16. I am satisfied that as the Appellant  and  sponsor  completed  the  visa
   application on the basis only of income from self  employment  the  Judge
   was entitled to consider evidence relating to only that source of income.
   If the Appellant wished to rely on another source of income in  order  to
   meet the financial threshold a fresh application should have been made.

17. The  grounds  argue  that  the  Judge  should  have  accepted  that  the
   Appellant's income was �56,050 rather than the figure of �16,727 and that
   his interpretation of what constituted income was unduly restrictive. The
   Judge sets out in detail his findings in relation to what he believed the
   sponsor's income was for the purpose of the Rules at paragraph 87 to 104.
   I am satisfied that it was open to him to conclude as he did at paragraph
   100:

   "It is perfectly clear that the phrase 'gross annual income' in section E-
   ECP.3.1(a) of Appendix FM, refers to annual income gross of tax, and  not
   turnover, or takings, sales and money taken, gross of  business  expenses
   and tax."

18. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge was entitled  to  conclude  that
   the Appellant's gross annual income from self employment was �16,727  and
   therefore he could not meet the requirements of the Rules.

19. In relation to income from self employment the Judge  also  set  out  at
   paragraph 37 the mandatory requirements of Appendix FM-SE in relation  to
   documentary evidence which included at A1(7)(g) 'evidence of ongoing self-
   employment through payment of Class 2 National Insurance  contributions.'
   The grounds argue that no specified document was required simply evidence
   that Class 2 NIC had been paid a fact that is accepted by  the  Judge  at
   paragraph 57 of his findings. It was argued before  the  Judge  that  the
   figure  for  tax  payable  in  the  sponsor's  tax  return  included   NI
   contributions. The Judge found that this was not stated in the tax return
   nor could it be inferred. This was a finding that was open to the  Judge.
   Given the Sponsors concession before me that in fact he  has  never  paid
   Class 2 NIC the Judge's conclusions were sound and the appeal was  doomed
   to fail.

20. The grounds also  argue  that  the  Judge's  Article  8  assessment  was
   flawed.  This was set out at paragraphs  106-130  and  the  findings  are
   detailed, well reasoned and refer to the relevant and  appropriate  legal
   guidance. The Judge therefore  considered  firstly  whether,  the  appeal
   having failed under the Rules in relation to  family  and  private  life,
   there were arguably good grounds for granting leave outside the Rules  in
   accordance with Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]
   UKUT  640  (IAC)   and  accepted  that  there  were.  He  structured  his
   assessment in a logical manner based on the 5 questions set out in Razgar
   . There is, I accept, a factual error in relation to whether the  parties
   could enjoy family life together in Kenya as the Judge  states  that  the
   sponsor is retired which is clearly not the case. Although  he  therefore
   suggests there is no apparent reason why the parties could not enjoy life
   together in Kenya he also considers the case on the basis that they could
   not. He took into account that the Appellant could not meet the financial
   requirements of  the  Rules  and  concludes  that  the  refusal  was  not
   disproportionate. He made reference MM and stated that he  did  not  feel
   this  compelled  him  to  a  different  conclusion:  given  that  MM  was
   overturned on appeal his  conclusions  that  the  income  threshold  were
   proportionate were open to him.

21. Having made  very  clear  in  the  body  of  what  is  a  very  detailed
   determination that the appeal was dismissed under the Rules and on  Human
   Rights grounds there is  one  other  error  in  that  under  the  heading
   'Decision' the Judge stated that he dismissed the case on asylum grounds.
    I am satisfied that when read as a whole the determination is clear that
   the basis of the decision was that the Judge dismissed the  appeal  under
   the Rules and that this was  a  typing  error  not  picked  up  in  proof
   reading.

22. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read  as  a
   whole set out findings that were sustainable  and  sufficiently  detailed
   and based on cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

23. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

24. The appeal is dismissed.
