                           DETERMINATION & REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Katharine  Gordon),  sitting  at  North  Shields  on  4
    January 2012[1], to  an asylum and human rights appeal by a citizen  of
    Nigeria. Another first-tier judge granted permission, on the article  8
    part of the case only, "after  some  hesitation"  on  the  basis  that,
    though Judge Gordon had found that the appellant "was not serious about
    regaining contact" with his two children with a British wife, from whom
    he had lived apart since (on his own account) no later than  2006,  the
    children's own best interests might require it.

 2. The children[2] are two girls, born in 2001 and  2003:  the  judge  had
    dealt with the case on the basis that the appellant had had since  2003
    to make an application for contact with his children;  but  his  mother
    had seen them herself in 2005, and thought that was when the  appellant
    had last  seen  them.  The  judge  had  before  her  a  letter  to  the
    appellant's solicitors from the Legal Services Commission [LSC] dated 7
    November 2011, asking him for further financial  information  about  an
    application he had made to them. She commented that this was as far  as
    the evidence went for his having made a contact application, as he  had
    claimed in his witness statement. That  was  entirely  correct  on  the
    information before the judge.

 3. The judge, most of whose attention was understandably directed  towards
    the appellant's  asylum/article  3  claim,  which  she  was  unarguably
    justified in rejecting, dealt with his claimed difficulties in  getting
    contact with the children, which he said were the result of his  wife's
    having moved  house  without  telling  him  where  she  had  gone,  and
    forbidding his parents, the only point of contact  he  had  left,  from
    disclosing her address, as follows

       His witness statement says that they are ... with their mother who is
       estranged from him. If the appellants [sic] genuinely wanted  contact
       with his children, he has had very many years to make application for
       it. She left him in 2003, 8 years ago. That he has  recently  applied
       for contact  (if  indeed  he  has)  does  not  satisfy  me  that  the
       application is genuine.

 4. That treatment of the case would  have  been  quite  adequate,  if  the
    evidence showed that the appellant had lived apart from his  wife,  and
    not seen the children since 2003, when the elder was only two, and  the
    younger just born. However, as the judge who granted permission pointed
    out, the appellant claimed to have lived with  the  children  "for  the
    early part of their lives", in other words till the elder was five, and
    the  younger  three.  I  too  thought  this   required   some   further
    consideration of their best interests; and, following the hearing of  3
    September 2012, I ruled that, to this extent only, there was  an  error
    of law on the part of the judge which required  a  re-hearing  of  this
    appeal.

CONTACT PROCEEDINGS

 5. As it happened, such consideration of the children's best interests was
    about to take place, before a court whose primary rï¿½le that  would  be.
    The appellant's solicitors, Andrew  Jackson  &  Co  of  Liverpool,  had
    written to the Tribunal on 13 June 2012, forwarding material for use at
    the September hearing "oral or dealt with on the papers": they did  not
    specify which it was to be. However they enclosed "a  letter  from  our
    client's Family Solicitor" (themselves, though they did not point  this
    out), confirming  that  there  would  be  an  initial  hearing  in  the
    appellant's contact proceedings, before Liverpool County  Court  on  11
    September 2012.



 6. The appellant appeared at the hearing before me, and produced a further
    letter from his solicitors, with a notice from the County Court, making
    it clear that the hearing on 11 September would be an  appointment  for
    directions to be given on their  application  for  an  order  that  the
    children's grandparents should be required to disclose  their  mother's
    address to the court, so that the appellant's contact application could
    proceed on notice to her.

 7. In the circumstances I decided to follow the form of order made  in  RS
    (immigration and family court proceedings) India [2012] UKUT (IAC) 218.
    With equal reluctance (see  RS  paragraph  50  on)  I  adjourned  these
    proceedings till after the decision of the family court on contact  was
    known. It seemed to me that there were  two  possible  results  in  the
    short term: either

     a) the appellant's contact application were to be allowed  to  proceed
        on notice to the children's mother, by way of a direction that  the
        grandparents disclose her address; or
     b) it might effectively be stopped in its tracks  (whether  before  or
        after a welfare report was obtained)  by  such  a  direction  being
        refused.

 8. If (a) were the result of the present stage of the contact proceedings,
    then the following further results were possible: either

    (a)       an order for direct contact between  the  appellant  and  his
        children; or
    (b)       an order for indirect contact only; or
     c) no order for contact at all.

 9. In my view the long history of this case meant that there  were  likely
    to be compelling public interest reasons for  the  immediate  exclusion
    from this country (see RS paragraph 43) of  the  appellant  unless  the
    contact proceedings resulted in an order for direct contact. Only  that
    was likely to bring down the balance on the  side  of  the  appellant's
    being allowed to stay in this country, in the children's best interests
    or for any other reason. In the circumstances, I directed that  further
    consideration of this case at a hearing would only be required if  that
    were the result of the contact proceedings. As it turned out, that  was
    not the case; but there was a further hearing, as will be seen below.

10. In accordance with my directions, following the hearing of 3  September
    2012, the appellant's solicitors regularly reported to me by e-mail the
    progress of the County Court case. Eventually the  contact  proceedings
    concluded in an order made on 25 April 2013, after hearing counsel  for
    the appellant, and the children's  mother  in  person,  and  reading  a
    report from CAFCASS,

       And upon [the appellant] acknowledging that it is in [the children's]
       best interests to have indirect contact only  with  him  due  to  the
       extent of their wishes and feelings howsoever held ... [to the effect
       that the appellant should] have fortnightly indirect contact with the
       children ... by way of photographs, letters, cards or age appropriate
       gifts

    A post office box was to be set up for this purpose,  its  cost  to  be
    shared between the parties. Continuing proceedings related  only  to  a
    proposed change in the children's names.



FINAL HEARING

11. By the time the order of 25  April  2013  reached  me,  I  had  already
    arranged to sit at North Shields on 5 July to hear another case;  so  I
    directed that this one too should be re-listed for final hearing  there
    then. Meanwhile, since the previous hearing, the final decision  in  RS
    (immigration/family court liaison: outcome) India [2013]  UKUT  82  had
    become available. In that case the family court had taken the view that
    the children's best interests would be served by annual visits to their
    father in India. While recognizing that the result of every case  about
    children must depend on the individual best interests of each child,  I
    plan to follow the general approach taken at this stage of RS too.

12. The first-tier proceedings had been entirely concerned, so far  as  the
    appellant's family life in this country went, with the two children who
    were the subject of the contact proceedings. The same was the case with
    the appellant's application for permission to appeal, and this was  the
    only basis on which permission was granted, and on which I  ruled  that
    there had been an error of law on the  part  of  the  first-tier  judge
    which required a further hearing.

13. Shortly after I made that  ruling,  I  received  from  the  appellant's
    solicitors a copy of a certificate, which he  said  showed  the  recent
    birth of a child by him to a woman who is only 21, but  now  a  British
    citizen: however they made no application for the proceedings before me
    to take any different course from the one directed. Events did not stop
    there, because, after some time together, the appellant and the  mother
    of his child fell out, and he now  faces  a  criminal  prosecution  for
    assault, brought by the police on her complaint, and to be heard before
    the Teesside Magistrates' Court on 25 September 2013.

14. Mr Davies told me, on the appellant's instructions, that the  appellant
    and his baby-mother were now reconciled, and  invited  me  to  put  the
    hearing back, so that I could take into account an e-mail  he  expected
    to receive from her,  confirming  that.  I  declined  to  do  so;  this
    relationship, though apparently in existence at least at  the  time  of
    the previous hearing before me, had formed no part of the case,  either
    before the first-tier judge or before  me,  and  consequently  was  not
    material to these Upper Tribunal proceedings.

15. While I might have had a discretion to allow  the  appellant's  present
    relationship and child to be brought into these proceedings, it  seemed
    to me that it would have been  wrong  to  do  so.  There  had  been  no
    opportunity for either the Home Office or the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    investigate what was essentially a wholly new case; and for me to do so
    effectively and fairly would have required  a  further  adjournment  of
    proceedings which had already been going on for much too long. If I had
    had to consider e-mail evidence  from  the  appellant's  present  baby-
    mother here and now, I  should  have  been  unlikely  to  give  it  any
    significant weight without her appearing to be cross-examined on it. If
    the present situation is as the appellant says it is, then he  will  be
    able to raise it in connexion with any removal directions  given  as  a
    result of these proceedings; nor did Mr Dewison suggest  it  should  be
    dealt with now.





CONCLUSIONS

16. At Mr Davies's request, I heard the appellant  give  a  short  personal
    account of the problems he had had, either in earning  anything,  given
    his lack of immigration status,  to  support  his  new  child  and  her
    mother, or to pay for lengthy contact  proceedings,  and  expressing  a
    wish to be allowed to stay in this country and do his  best  for  them.
    However, these proceedings are about the  best  interests  of  his  two
    earlier children:  as  the  County  Court  order  records,  he  himself
    acknowledged that these would be best served by indirect  contact  only
    between him and them, and a means was agreed of  ensuring  that,  by  a
    method which does not require his continued presence in this country.

17. That acknowledgement, whatever motives the appellant may have  had  for
    it in his own situation, does him credit as a father; but the order set
    out at 10 also means that there is no  significant  factor  outweighing
    the strong public interest already noted in his removal. The  appellant
    is 32, and says he arrived in this country with his father as a visitor
    in 1998, when he was about 17. He never left, but was given  notice  of
    removal as an overstayer on 29 August 2003. On 5 September  he  applied
    to stay as a husband, which was refused on the 9th: his appeal  against
    that decision was finally dismissed on 7 September 2006.

18. Following that, no more was heard from, or done about the appellant  by
    the Home Office till 5 May 2011, when he made further  representations,
    rejected on the 9th. He must have had one or more criminal  convictions
    before the sentence of 28 days he received  for  breaking  his  licence
    conditions by being found in possession of a bladed weapon earlier that
    year; but I have not been given details of them. According to  what  he
    told the judge, he had been convicted of wounding contrary  to  section
    20 of the Offences of the Person Act 1861. On  17  June  the  appellant
    claimed asylum, refused on 18 November, which led to these proceedings:
    the judge's reasons for rejecting the history on  which  he  based  his
    claim are unassailable.

19. The result is that, leaving  aside  the  question  of  the  appellant's
    present baby-mother, said to be a British citizen (but I  have  neither
    seen her nor her passport) and their children, and the pending criminal
    proceedings involving the two of them, his current position is this. He
    was nearly grown-up when he arrived in this country in  1998,  but  may
    not have been wholly to blame for the initial decision to overstay  his
    leave, if he did so with his father. However, by 2003 he  was  grown-up
    enough not only to be married, but to have begotten two children.  That
    marriage had broken down by 2005, when  he  last  saw  those  children.
    Following the dismissal of his first appeal on that basis in 2006,  the
    appellant continued to overstay without any claim to remain here at all
    till 2011.


20. Since the beginning  of  2012,  when  the  appellant's  appeal  against
    refusal of his very late asylum claim was dismissed, there has been  no
    good reason whatsoever for letting him stay in this country, except for
    the pending case about the children which has resulted in an order  for
    him to have indirect contact only with them. He has family in  Nigeria,
    and the judge rejected his claim to have had difficulties in  connexion
    with them. The balance is overwhelmingly in favour of this  appellant's
    immediate removal.
