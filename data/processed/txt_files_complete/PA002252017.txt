For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blair, promulgated on  6  July  2017,  dismissing  his  appeal  against
    refusal of asylum.

 2. Having heard submissions from both parties, I indicated that  ground  4
    could not be upheld, and it was doubtful whether ground 1 disclosed any
    error, but grounds 2, 3 and 5 together were sufficient to require a re-
    hearing.

 3. Ms Speirs was content for the case  to  be  remitted,  without  further
    resolution of ground 1.

 4. The Judge did not simply find that the appellant  failed  to  establish
    his case, he held in unusually trenchant terms that the  evidence  from
    the appellant and two witnesses was perjured (�38, 40).

 5. Ground 2, in particular, is well taken.  The  judge  at  �33  said  the
    appellant had "no idea" at his  asylum  interview  that  Pentecost  was
    celebrated 50 days after Easter, thought he must have learned about the
    matter since, and gave this quite a high degree  of  significance.   At
    Q/A 213 - 215 and  thereafter  of  the  interview,  the  appellant  did
    explain the meaning of Pentecost  and  its  occurrence  50  days  after
    Easter.  The judge thus fell into a  clear  mistake  of  material  fact
    which amounts to an error of law.

 6. Ground 3 is directed against �35 - 38  and  onwards,  where  the  judge
    rejected evidence that the appellant's Church met  in  premises  shared
    with the Free Church of Scotland at 265 St Vincent  Street,  Glasgow  -
    partly because of the unlikelihood of the Free Church sharing  premises
    with a Pentecostal denomination, and also because of  the  failings  in
    evidence of the  appellant  and  the  two  witnesses.   Some  of  those
    failings were capable of being found significantly adverse, but, as the
    grounds point out, there was evidence from all three  about  where  the
    Church met, and a letter from it, headed from that address.   If  there
    was no such Church, there was consistency and audacity in  inventing  a
    point which could easily be checked.  There may be no error in applying
    judicial knowledge about the unlikelihood  of  denominational  sharing,
    and that may  not  be  simply  speculative,  as  the  grounds  contend.
    However, these facts about  the  building  at  St  Vincent  Street  are
    equally public knowledge: it is an architecturally significant building
    (close to the hearing centre), built in 1859, not for the  Free  Church
    or in its usual style, owned by Glasgow City Council, and rented  since
    1971 to the Free Church.  Those are  matters  which  may  make  sharing
    appear a little more likely.

 7. This ground does not establish a clear mistake of fact (more might have
    been done in that direction), but it does disclose reasoning which,  as
    a whole, and in light of other grounds, is difficult to support.

 8. (Now that the matter is further out in the open,  at  a  rehearing  the
    appellant may be expected to produce clear evidence to show that  there
    is or was sharing of the premises at 165 St Vincent Street.  While  the
    onus remains on the appellant, it is also an issue which  might  easily
    be resolved by the respondent.)

 9. Ground 5 is directed against �29 of the  decision.   At  interview  the
    appellant said that he spoke both Amharic and Tigrinya (see  Q/A  34  -
    43) and was tested on  3  random  phrases,  which  he  translated  from
    Amharic to Tigrinya.  The refusal  letter  is  based  in  part  on  the
    appellant's "declared" level of Tigrinya being "at odds" with his claim
    to be an Eritrean national and the  "fact"  that  Amharic  remains  his
    primary language, but nothing is said about how his level  of  Tigrinya
    has been assessed, or how it falls short of  what  might  be  expected.
    The Judge founds on the appellant having "little or  no  Tigrinya"  but
    that assumption is not consistent with the appellant's asylum record or
    his other evidence, and  is  unexplained.   This  is  another  apparent
    misconception of the evidence.

10. Ground 4 is wrong.  There are no legal rules that reasons for  a  grant
    of asylum are irrelevant, or  that  witnesses  should  be  accepted  as
    truthful because they have been granted refugee status.  The case cited
    does not support the latter proposition.

11. It need not be resolved whether ground  1  amounts  to  any  more  than
    disagreement with  the  judge's  assessment  of  the  appellant's  oral
    evidence regarding his baptism.

12. Grounds 2, 3 and 5 together  disclose  error  such  that  the  decision
    cannot safely stand as a resolution of the claim.

13. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

14. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

15. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Blair.

16. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
