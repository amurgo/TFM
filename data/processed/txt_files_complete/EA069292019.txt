                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Nigerian national who was born on 16  January  1995.
    She appeals, with permission granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer,
    against a decision  which  was  issued  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Suffield-Thompson ("the judge") on 27 March 2020.   By  that  decision,
    the judge dismissed the appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    refusal to issue her a residence card as the spouse of an EEA national.




 2. The appellant claimed to be the spouse of a French national named Ruddy
    Fabrice Saxemard.  She states that  she  and  the  sponsor  married  by
    proxy, according to the customary laws of Nigeria, on 8 June 2017.  She
    applied for a residence card in reliance on that relationship in August
    2017.  That application was refused and an appeal was  dismissed  by  a
    judge of the FtT in 2018.  The judge did not accept,  apparently,  that
    the appellant was validly married to the sponsor.

 3. On 25 July  2019,  the  appellant  made  a  second  application  for  a
    residence card.  It was the refusal of this application which was under
    appeal  before  the  judge.   In  her  decision,  the  respondent  made
    extensive  reference  to  the  decision  of  the  first  judge   before
    concluding that the proxy marriage was not valid and that the applicant
    was not the family member of an EEA national as a result.

 4. The judge heard the appeal 'on the papers', that having been the course
    she was invited to take by the appellant, who had also paid the fee  of
    ï¿½80 to request disposal in that  manner.   The  judge  noted  that  the
    appellant claimed to have been married at Enugu South Local  Government
    Office on 8 June 2017.  She noted that the  appellant  had  produced  a
    letter from the Enugu government office dated 26 January  2018  in  the
    course of her first appeal.  She noted that she did not have the  first
    judge's decision but that the respondent had cited extensively from  it
    in the letter of refusal.  She attached significance, as had the  first
    judge, to the absence of the word  'proxy'  from  the  copied  marriage
    certificate and the letter of 26  January  2018.   She  was  unable  to
    attach any weight to that letter, not least because the word  'Nigeria'
    was misspelt.  At [19], the judge declined to attach any  weight  to  a
    letter from the Nigerian High Commission; she was unable to see a stamp
    from the High Commission on the document and the appellant

         'would need to submit a letter from the Nigerian Embassy to confirm
         that she has genuinely married the  appellant  [sic]  by  proxy  to
         satisfy this Tribunal especially as all the documents submitted are
         poor quality copies and have been copied in various sections so  it
         is not possible to see the documents properly as a whole.'


 5. At [20], the judge  noted  that  the  appellant  could  have  submitted
    photographs of herself and the sponsor, letters between them,  evidence
    of constant communication, or a witness statement or letter  from  him.
    All of these things the judge  thought  were  'easily  obtainable'  and
    there was a real paucity of evidence.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Plimmer expressed some  concern
    that the judge may have overlooked (or may not have had sight of)  some
    of the documents relied upon by the appellant.   She  was  directed  by
    Judge Plimmer to  file  and  serve  a  witness  statement  listing  the
    documents she had relied upon before the FtT.  The appellant  duly  did
    so.  Taking the grounds and the witness statement together, it  appears
    that the appellant's central submission is that  the  judge  overlooked
    evidence which had been pprovided to the FtT in advance of the hearing.



 7. At the start of the hearing, Mr Jarvis stated that he was  without  the
    original Home Office file and  he  asked  me  to  detail  for  him  the
    evidence on the Tribunal's file.  I explained that there was  a  bundle
    of 54 pages containing witness statements made by the appellant and the
    sponsor and further evidence in support of those  statements  and  that
    there was also a brown envelope in the file which contained  a  variety
    of original documents.

 8. Mr Jarvis accepted, on balance, that the  appellant's  bundle  and  the
    brown envelope containing original documents had been provided  to  the
    FtT before the file was provided to the  judge  for  determination.   I
    consider that concession to have been correctly made.  The  appellant's
    bundle states on the first page that it was prepared for a  hearing  in
    Newport.  It contains, at p54, the notice of hearing  before  the  FtT.
    The statements made by the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  are  dated  3
    February  2020.   The  chronology  notes  that  the  deadline  for  the
    submission of further evidence is 4  February  2020.   There  is  every
    reason to think that this bundle, and the  original  documents  in  the
    brown envelope, were provided to the Tribunal before the file made  its
    way to the judge.

 9.  For  whatever  reason,  the  judge  did  not  make  reference  to  the
    appellant's bundle or to the original documents.  Given her observation
    about the absence of a witness statement from the sponsor, it is  quite
    clear to me that she cannot have seen the  bundle  which  contains,  at
    item 3, precisely such a statement.  Equally, given what the judge said
    about the absence of original documents, it is quite clear that she did
    not see the original documents in the  brown  envelope,  including  the
    original of the marriage certificate, for example.

10. Nor did the judge make any reference to a  document  dated  27  January
    which appears at p18 of the appellant's bundle.  That document confirms
    that the proxy marriage took place; that it is  registered  with  Enugu
    South Local Government; and that  proxy  marriages  are  recognised  in
    Nigeria.  That was plainly relevant evidence which post-dated the first
    judge's decision and which the judge should have considered but did not
    do so, for whatever reason.

11. Mr Jarvis accepted, for all of these reasons, that the  judge  had  not
    had sight of, or had not considered, the  appellant's  bundle  and  the
    original documents  which  had  been  provided  to  the  FtT.   In  the
    circumstances, he submitted that the proper course was for the  judge's
    decision to be set aside and for the appeal to be remitted to be  heard
    afresh by a different judge.  On the facts of this case, I consider  he
    was correct to make those submissions and I shall so order.   There  is
    no reason to doubt - and every  reason  to  accept  -  the  appellant's
    complaint that something went seriously wrong before the FtT.

12. I note three further matters for the sake  of  completeness.   Firstly,
    the Upper Tribunal was notified shortly before  the  hearing  that  the
    appellant was to be represented by a firm of solicitors named Citi Law.
     There was no attendance by that firm when the  matter  was  called  on
    before me.  It was whilst enquiries were being made by my  clerk  about
    their non-attendance  that  Mr  Jarvis  made  the  concessions  I  have
    recorded above.  I was able to indicate, in the circumstances,  that  I
    agreed with his concessions and the relief he had suggested.   When  my
    clerk  had  finally  made  contact  with  the  appellant's   solicitor,
    therefore, I was able to indicate that the decision of the FtT  was  to
    be set aside by consent and remitted to be heard afresh.  He confirmed,
    in those circumstances, that he  did  not  wish  to  make  any  further
    submissions, having received all that he sought.

13. Secondly, Mr Jarvis suggested that this  is  a  case  which  should  be
    determined at a hearing on the next occasion.  That is not  for  me  to
    decide; it is a question for the next FtT judge, exercising his or  her
    discretion and applying the overriding objective.   It  might  well  be
    thought, however, that the history of  this  matter  and  the  need  to
    ensure that both parties receive a fair disposal, that  the  overriding
    objective militates in favour of Mr Jarvis's submission.

14. Thirdly, I noted with some concern that the FtT had proceeded without a
    copy of the first judge's decision.  Whilst she was undoubtedly correct
    to observe that the respondent had cited  from  that  decision  in  the
    letter of refusal, the ordinary course  of  events  would  be  for  the
    Devaseelan [2003] Imm AR 1 starting point to be before the  next  judge
    in full, rather than excerpts selected by a party.  The  decision  will
    be available from  the  FtT's  archive  and  should,  to  my  mind,  be
    requested in advance of any fresh consideration, whether that is to  be
    on the papers or at a hearing.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT involved the making of an error on a  point  of  law
and it is set aside.  The decision on the appeal is be  set  aside  and  the
appeal is remitted to the FtT to be heard afresh by a different judge.

No anonymity direction is made.
