                           MR PEDRO LUIS DIAZ CRUZ

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Everett (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Thoree (Legal Representative)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Whereas the  respondent  is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.


 2. The appellant, born April 21, 1968 is a citizen of Ecuador. On April 9,
    2013 he sought a residence card as the  unmarried  partner  of  an  EEA
    national  exercising  treaty  rights.  The   respondent   refused   his
    application on July 11, 2013 as she was  not  satisfied  he  was  in  a
    durable relationship.

 3. On August 19, 2013 the appellant appealed under Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Regulation 26  of  the
    Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  arguing  the
    Regulations had been met because he was in a durable relationship.

 4. The matter was listed before Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Walters
    (hereinafter referred to  as  "the  FtTJ")  on  June  25,  2014.  In  a
    determination promulgated on July 15, 2014 he allowed the appeal  under
    2006 Regulations.

 5. The respondent appealed that decision on July 19, 2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shimmin on  July
    30, 2014. He found the FtTJ may have erred for the reasons set  out  in
    the grounds.

    ERROR OF LAW ARGUMENTS


 6. Ms Everett relied on the grounds of appeal and accepted there had  been
    no challenge to the FtTJ's finding on the durability of the appellant's
    relationship. She submitted that because this was an application by  an
    extended family member the FtTJ should have referred the matter back to
    the respondent if he found the relationship durable. She referred me to
    Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 Regulations.

 7. Mr Thoree accepted there was an error in law and that the  FtTJ  should
    have referred the matter  back  to  the  respondent  having  found  the
    relationship was durable.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT


 8. In light of the concession made I find there has been an error in law I
    direct that the matter be remitted back to the respondent  to  consider
    the  application  afresh  in  light  of  the  FtTJ's  findings  on  the
    durability of the relationship.


    DECISION


 9. There is a material error of law and I set aside the original decision.



10. The appeal is allowed under the 2006 Regulations to the limited  extent
    that the respondent is invited to consider  exercising  her  discretion
    under Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 Regulations.


11. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.


Signed:                           Dated:




Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Alis


TO THE RESPONDENT

I do not make a fee award for the same reasons as previously given.
