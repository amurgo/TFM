                                   Between

                                 JOSHEP [S]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL



 1. In granting permission to appeal to this Tribunal, a Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal wrote as follows:

         "3.  In its decision, the Tribunal  rejected  the  claim  that  the
         Appellant would be unable to communicate on return.  Arguably,  the
         panel failed to give adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the  expert
         evidence in that regard.  It is also arguable that, having accepted
         that the Appellant was a member of the TGTE, that he had taken part
         in activities in the UK and had been  photographed  in  the  course
         thereof, the Tribunal erred in concluding that he would not  be  at
         risk on return."

 2. Having reviewed the file, and concluding that the grounds  are  clearly
    arguable, I wrote to the parties on 1 March  2021  proposing  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision be set aside in  error  of  law  without
    more ado and that the appeal be remitted for  a  fresh  decision.   The
    parties had 21 days to make submissions to the contrary.

 3. Ms Isherwood,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,  has  replied
    specifically raising no objection to the proposal.  No reply  has  been
    received from the appellant's representatives.

 4. I set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  sent  out  on  16
    November  2020  for  error  of  law  as  identified  in  the  grant  of
    permission.  I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for decision
    afresh.

                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
