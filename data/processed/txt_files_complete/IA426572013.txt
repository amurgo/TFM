                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant, a citizen of Nigeria born on 1 July
    1975, against the determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Cope  in
    which the Judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the  Secretary
    of State's decision to refuse his application for a Residence  Card  as
    the family member of an EEA national following his marriage by proxy.

 2. The Appellant's application was made on 27 November 2012 and refused by
    reference to regulations  7  and  8(5)  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic  Area)  Regulations  on  19  September  2013.   The  Appellant
    exercised his right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  and  this  is
    the appeal which came before Judge  Cope  on  20  March  2014  and  was
    dismissed. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The application was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Plumptre on 13 May 2014 in the following terms

        It is clear both from the Appellant's written submissions  and  the
        Respondent's refusal letter that the primary case was based on  the
        proxy marriage. However it may be arguable that judge Cope erred in
        law by not considering the alternative submissions namely a durable
        relationship and rights under Article 8 ECHR  both  of  which  were
        raised in written  submissions  and  in  the  Respondent's  refusal
        letter.



 3. In a rule 24 letter dated 17  June  2014  the  Respondent  opposed  the
    Appellant's appeal and in doing so accepted that the Judge had erred by
    not dealing with the question of durable  relationship  but  said  that
    such error was not material to the decision to dismiss the appeal.

 4. At the hearing before me the Appellant was represented by  Ms  Akintola
    who submitted an indexed appeal bundle and a written skeleton argument.
    Mr Nath appeared to represent the Secretary of State and did not submit
    any additional documents.


Submissions - Error of Law

 5. On behalf the Appellant Ms Akintola  relied  on  the  written  skeleton
    argument. The Respondent had dealt with the  durable  relationship  and
    Article 8 in the reasons for refusal letter and both were raised in the
    written submissions to the First-tier  Tribunal.  The  failure  of  the
    Judge do deal with these aspects was a material error of law.

 6. For the Respondent Mr Nath relied on the rule 24 notice and  said  that
    although the Judge had not dealt with these aspects the error  was  not
    material as the Appellant had failed to discharge the burden  of  proof
    to show evidence of a durable relationship.

 7. I concluded that the Judge had materially erred in law in reaching  her
    decision and reserved my written reasons.  I  proceeded  to  hear  oral
    evidence to enable me to remake the decision.



Oral evidence

 8. The Appellant gave evidence in English. He confirmed his  identity  and
    address and adopted his written witness statement as submitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal and dated 11 December 2013. He said that he and his
    partner are still together and they live at the same address where they
    have lived since November 2011. His partner is working. She is  not  at
    work at the moment, she is in Portugal. Her mother had an accident  and
    his partner had to go to see her. His partner is expected back in  this
    country in about 2 week's time. She works as a support worker  and  has
    held this job since May of last year. The Appellant is not working.  He
    cannot work because of his lack of status documentation. He last worked
    in May 2012.

 9. The Appellant referred to  the  tenancy  agreement  in  his  bundle  of
    evidence. The rent is still ï¿½650 per month. His partner pays  this  and
    other household bills. The Appellant said that he and his partner could
    not live in Nigeria due to family issues. It is a security matter.  His
    late father was  a  community  leader  and  he  was  assassinated.  The
    Appellant said that his partner has never been to Nigeria. She does not
    understand the language. They met  in  February  2010  and  married  in
    January 2012.

10. Cross-examined by Mr Nath in the Appellant said that he had never  made
    an asylum claim because he did not need to. His father  died  in  April
    2012. The Appellant has not returned to Nigeria since arriving  in  the
    United Kingdom in 2008. He has never been to  Portugal.  The  Appellant
    said that his wife transfers money to his account so that  he  can  pay
    bills.

11. The Appellant said that he has met his wife's sister Miriam in Croydon.
    His wife went to see her mother in Portugal on Wednesday, 2 days before
    this hearing. He agreed that he had no corroborative evidence that this
    was the case.  He  said  that  her  mother  had  a  car  accident.  The
    Appellant's wife's mother lives with her husband but he is old.


Submissions - Remaking the decision

12. For the Respondent Mr Nath said that the refusal letter deals with  the
    question of durable relationship. The Appellant has given oral evidence
    today that his partner is not here. The documentary  evidence  consists
    of a tenancy agreement and bills in the names of the Appellant and  his
    partner. He claims to receive money by way  of  financial  support  but
    there is no real evidence to show how he  has  supported  himself.  The
    only member of his partner's family that he claims to have met  is  her
    sister. Mr Nath accepted that he had not put questions to the Appellant
    doubting his relationship but said that the burden of proof is upon the
    Appellant and his wife is  not  here  and  there  is  no  corroborative
    evidence of her whereabouts.

13. For the Appellant Ms Akintola referred to the bundle of evidence and in
    particular pages 25 to 128 and said that this shows ample evidence of a
    durable relationship. It shows that the  Appellant  and  his  wife  are
    living together, sharing a home and household bills and supporting each
    other.


Decision

Error of law

14. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2008  as  a
    student with leave to remain until  31  January  2010.  His  leave  was
    extended for post study work until 3 March 2012. He did  not  apply  to
    extend his leave to remain but instead applied for a residence card  as
    confirmation of a right to reside  as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national. His first application was refused  on  8  May  2012  and  his
    subsequent application made on 27  November  2012  was  refused  on  19
    September 2013. That is the decision now under appeal.

15. In refusing his application the Respondent first of all considered  the
    marital relationship between the Appellant and his claimed spouse. In a
    detailed reasons for refusal letter the Respondent took issue with  the
    validity of the Appellant's claimed marriage which had taken  place  by
    proxy. Having concluded that the claimed marriage was not valid in  law
    the Respondent went on to consider whether the Appellant qualified  for
    a residence card on the  basis  of  a  durable  relationship  with  his
    claimed partner. The Respondent concluded that there  was  insufficient
    evidence to suggest that the  Appellant  and  his  partner  were  in  a
    durable relationship for  the  purpose  of  the  EEA  regulations.  The
    application for a residence card was therefore refused. The  Respondent
    did not go on to consider the application by reference to Article 8  of
    the Human Rights Convention because although the  Appellant  had  asked
    for  his  case  to  be  considered  in  this  respect  the  appropriate
    application had not been made.

16. The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  took  place  on  papers  at  the
    request of the Appellant. Prior to the consideration of the appeal  the
    Appellant, through  his  legal  representatives,  put  forward  written
    submissions that clearly show that the Appellant took  issue  not  only
    with the decision not to recognise the validity  of  the  marriage  but
    also  the  decisions  made  in  respect  of  the  durability   of   the
    relationship and Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal carefully examined the question of the  validity  of  the
    marriage and concluded that  the  Appellant  had  not  shown  that  the
    marriage was valid. However despite noting,  at  paragraph  44  of  the
    determination,  that  the  Respondent  had  gone  on  to  consider  the
    application on the basis of the  durability  of  the  relationship  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge explicitly declined to consider the appeal in
    this respect. The Judge's reasoning was simply that the application was
    made as a spouse and not as an extended family member. The comments  of
    the Respondent regarding extended family members were said  not  to  be
    relevant to the Appellant. Further the judge went on to say that  there
    was no need to deal with Article 8 because the Respondent had not  made
    a decision to remove.

17. In the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal the Appellant  does  not
    challenge the decision so far as it relates  to  the  validity  of  the
    marriage. Similarly there is no challenge to the decision in respect of
    Article 8. The grounds assert that the judge  failed  to  consider  the
    evidence of the durability of the relationship.

18. The rule 24 response filed on behalf of the Respondent accepts that the
    Judge erred in finding that the part of the refusal letter dealing with
    the question of durable relationship was not relevant to the Appellant.
    However the statement and Mr Nath's submissions suggest that this error
    was not material to the decision to dismiss the appeal. In my judgement
    such a conclusion cannot properly be  reached.  The  error  of  law  is
    manifest. Not only did the reasons for refusal letter  deal  with  both
    the validity of the marriage and the durability of the relationship but
    also the Notice of Refusal  itself  dealt  with  both  issues.  It  was
    apparent from the facts being put forward  by  the  Appellant  that  he
    claimed that his relationship was durable. The legality or otherwise of
    the marriage ceremony was on the facts being put forward irrelevant  to
    the durability of the relationship. Where such a fundamental  issue  is
    excluded from  consideration  the  error  of  law  apparent  from  such
    exclusion could only be immaterial if it was  manifestly  obvious  that
    the judge could not have been satisfied  with  the  durability  of  the
    relationship even if he had considered the evidence. On this basis  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal falls to be set aside.


Remaking the decision

19. In remaking the decision I have  taken  into  account  the  documentary
    evidence contained in the Appellant's bundle the oral evidence  of  the
    Appellant and the written and oral submissions of both representatives.
    The documentary evidence includes a tenancy agreement that purports  to
    corroborate the fact that the Appellant and  his  partner  share  their
    living accommodation. It also includes letters, bills,  payslips,  bank
    statements and other documents to show that the couple share  the  same
    address. One of the documents is a joint life insurance policy by which
    for a monthly premium of ï¿½10 the life of  each  party  is  insured  for
    ï¿½65,925. There is a written  statement  from  the  Appellant  dated  11
    December 2013 and a brief statement of the same date from  his  partner
    adopting his statement as a true account of events.

20. The oral evidence from the Appellant  confirmed  the  contents  of  his
    statement. The Appellant said that he and his partner continued to live
    together. He explained that she was not present as she was out  of  the
    country having travelled to see her mother who had been  injured  in  a
    road accident.

21. The burden of proof is upon the Appellant and the standard of proof  is
    the balance of probabilities. Where the durability of a relationship is
    the substance of an appeal hearing it is rarely going to  be  the  case
    that the burden of proof will be satisfied without oral evidence.  This
    is not because the standard of proof is a high one it is simply because
    the satisfaction of that standard normally requires a specific type  of
    evidence being the assurance of the parties to the relationship of  its
    existence and quality. In this case neither party gave oral evidence to
    the First-tier Tribunal. The Appellant  relied  solely  on  documentary
    evidence. Whereas this evidence speaks to cohabitation it does  not  in
    my judgement speak to quality or durability. In particular the  written
    statement of the Appellant's  partner  adds  nothing.  The  joint  life
    policy is not explained in the written statement of the  Appellant  and
    does not in my judgement add  any  value.  For  a  relationship  to  be
    durable the Judge must be satisfied on the day that  he  considers  the
    evidence that the relationship is continuing and it is  very  difficult
    to reach such a conclusion without hearing oral evidence.

22. At the hearing before me the appellant gave oral  evidence.  This  oral
    evidence did not in my judgement  add  significantly  to  the  evidence
    contained in his statement. He was not questioned in any  detail  about
    the quality of his relationship with his partner. There was  no  up  to
    date statement from the Appellant's partner despite the appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal being based upon the durability  of  their  relationship
    and despite the date of the Upper Tribunal  hearing  being  known  long
    before the Appellant's partner's claimed emergency  trip  to  Portugal.
    The Appellant's explanation  for  his  partner's  absence  was,  in  my
    judgement, remarkably vague. He did not appear to have any  clear  idea
    of what injuries the Appellant's mother had suffered, why she needed to
    travel to Portugal at short  notice  or  when  she  would  return.  The
    Appellant did not explain why he had no  evidence  to  corroborate  his
    partner's whereabouts or even any  up-to-date  statement  from  her  to
    corroborate the durability of their relationship.

23. The issue before me is a simple one. I need to  determine  whether  the
    Respondent was right not to be satisfied that  the  Appellant  and  his
    partner have a durable relationship. Where the issue in question is the
    durability of a relationship it will normally be necessary to hear from
    both parties to the relationship to satisfy the burden  of  proof.  The
    onus is not on the Respondent to show  that  the  relationship  is  not
    durable but on the appellant to show that it is. In  my  judgement  and
    for the reasons given above the Appellant has not satisfied the  burden
    of proof to show that  he  has  a  durable  relationship  with  an  EEA
    national. It must follow therefore that his appeal in this  respect  is
    dismissed. It must equally follow that his appeal by virtue of  Article
    8 of the Human Rights Convention is also dismissed since the  basis  of
    that appeal was the family life that he shares with  his  partner.  Not
    being satisfied that the Appellant and  his  partner  share  a  durable
    relationship I am not satisfied that  they  share  a  family  life.  No
    submissions  were  put  forward  to  suggest  that  the  Appellant  had
    established a protected private life in the United Kingdom. The  appeal
    is therefore dismissed.

 Summary

24. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law. I set aside that decision.

25. I remake the decision by dismissing the appeal both in respect  of  the
    EEA regulations and Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.
