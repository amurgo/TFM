                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pickup promulgated on 18 December 2014  which  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal against refusal of leave to remain as  a  victim
    of domestic violence under the Rules and on human rights grounds .

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on 1 May 1983 and is a national of Pakistan.

 4. On 27 February 2014 the  Appellant  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as a victim of domestic violence.

 5. On 11  July  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application by reference to paragraph 289A and  322(12)  on  the  basis
    that the Appellant had failed to establish that his  relationship  with
    his wife had been caused to break  down  permanently  as  a  result  of
    domestic violence or was indeed subsisting at the date of  his  arrival
    (289A) and because there was an outstanding debt of ï¿½1985.66 to the NHS
    (322(12) )

The Judge's Decision

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Pickup  ("the  Judge")  dismissed   the   appeal   against   the
    Respondent's decision. The Judge found :

      a) He failed to give a credible explanation  as  to  why  he  did  not
         petition for divorce for 3 years and 7 months.

      b) His marriage broke down on arrival in the  United  Kingdom  and  he
         only lived with his wife for 10 days.

      c) There was an inconsistency between his claim in the covering letter
         with his LTR application that he left the matrimonial home in  2011
         and his oral evidence that it was 2010.

      d) He did not find his explanation for his failure to complain at  the
         hospital about his alleged  treatment  was  credible  changing  his
         account as to why he failed to do so.

      e) The hospital notes did not support his claim of domestic violence.

      f) He gave limited weight to the Psychiatric report which was based on
         uncritical acceptance of his factual account.

      g) There were inconsistencies between  the  account  recorded  in  the
         psychiatric report and the rest of the Appellant's case  which  the
         Appellant was unable to satisfactorily explain.

      h) The Appellant was a poor witness  and  repeatedly  claimed  he  was
         unable to understand questions or directly answer them.

      i) He concluded that  the  marriage  was  not  caused  to  break  down
         permanently because of domestic violence.

      j) The Appellant was also refused on the basis  of  the  discretionary
         ground that he had an outstanding  NHS  bill.  The  Judge  did  not
         accept that at the time the bill accrued the Appellant was  in  the
         United Kingdom  lawfully  and  therefore  found  that  he  was  not
         entitled to free treatment as claimed and therefore the  discretion
         to refuse was properly exercised.

 7. Grounds of appeal were lodged on  the  basis  that  there  had  been  a
    procedural irregularity in that the court interpreter spoke a different
    language to the Appellant who stated that he had  requested  a  Mirpuri
    interpreter and the interpreter at court spoke  Punjabi  and  that  the
    Judge failed to take into account the Respondent's Guidance in relation
    to refusal based on non payment of NHS charges.

 8. Designated First-tier tribunal Judge Baird gave permission to appeal on
    both grounds stating:

         "Clearly there were  problems  with  the  interpreter  and  it  was
         perhaps not unreasonable for the Judge to proceed with the  hearing
         in  the  absence  of  any  formal  complaint  or  request   for   a
         replacement. It has however come to my attention, in the  light  of
         enquiries having been made on receipt of  the  Appellant's  letter,
         that although the  interpreter  does  speak  some  Mirpuri  and  is
         registered with the tribunal at  the  necessary  level  in  another
         language, he is not registered for Mirpuri  at  the  preferred  and
         usual level but at a lower one."

 9. At the hearing I heard  submissions  from  Mr  Ali  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that:

      a) A Mirpuri interpreter was requested and not obtained.

      b) There was no clarification at the start of the hearing as  to  what
         lanagauge was used.

      c) There are a number of dialects of Punjabi and  the  differences  in
         meaning can be significant.

      d) The Judge's remarks at  paragraph  23  demonstrated  that  he  made
         adverse findings  in  circumstances  were  the  Appellant  did  not
         understand questions asked.

      e) The rest of the decision was infected  by  the  problems  with  the
         interrupter and the findings in  relation  to  paragraph  322  (12)
         could not be separated from the rest of the case.

10. On behalf of the Respondent  Mr Mc Vitie submitted that :

      a) He conceded that given what was recorded at paragraph 23 there were
         obvious problems with the interpreter and the judge concluded  that
         the Appellant was simply a poor witness.

      b)  The  refusal  in  relation  to  paragraph  322  (12)  could  stand
         separately but he conceded that as it was  a  discretionary  ground
         refusal was not inevitable.



Finding on Material Error

11. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made material errors of law.

12. The Appellant in this case made an application for indefinite leave  to
    remain claiming to be a victim of domestic violence.

13. Every Appellant is entitled to a fair hearing and I am satisfied that a
    fair  hearing  must  include  him  being  given  the   opportunity   to
    participate in the proceedings by being provided with an interrupter in
    his  chosen  language  in  order  that  he  can  properly  answer   any
    allegations made against him.

14. The Appellant's account of his marriage and how  he  claimed  it  broke
    down was not found to  be  credible  by  the  Judge  on  the  basis  of
    inconsistencies in his written and oral evidence which  undermined  his
    general credibility. This finding was underpinned by the Judge's belief
    that he understood what he was being asked in the course of the hearing
    but simply chose to be evasive or falsely claim he did  not  understand
    the questions. The Judge at paragraph 23 summarised  his  view  of  the
    Appellant as a witness in this way:

         "I found the appellant to be a very poor witness in his own  cause.
         He appears to have found it difficult to answer straight  questions
         with straight answers. Repeatedly he said he did not understand the
         questions put to him or did not directly answer them,  even  though
         they were put to him again. I also  had  to  ask  Mr  Ayub  not  to
         intervene in the translation of questions or answers to assist  the
         appellant."

15.  It  now  transpires  that  the  Appellant  had  asked  for  a  Mirpuri
    interpreter but that Samina Azam who attended on the day of the hearing
    does speak some Mirpuri and is registered  with  the  tribunal  at  the
    necessary level in another language, he is not registered  for  Mirpuri
    at the preferred and usual level but at a lower one.

16. It is not recorded in the written decision what checks the  Judge  made
    as to whether the Appellant and the interpreter understood each  other.
    Contrary to Mr Ali's claim some checks were clearly made as I note that
    the language on the record of proceedings was marked as  'Mirpuri'  but
    this was crossed out by the Judge who wrote  'Punjabi.'  However  given
    that the Appellant had not been given an interpreter in the language he
    requested and there were obvious problems in understanding recorded  by
    the Judge  at  paragraph  23  which  included  his  inability  to  give
    'straight answers'  and  repeatedly  claiming  not  to  understand  the
    questions I am satisfied that  the  Appellant  was  not  given  a  fair
    hearing. This error I consider to be material since had  the  Appellant
    been  provided  with  an  interpreter  who  he  understood  the  Judges
    conclusion as to the  credibility  of  his  evidence  could  have  been
    different. That in my view is the correct test to apply.

17. I cannot exclude the possibility that  the  rest  of  the  decision  is
    infected by the failure to provide the Appellant  with  an  interpreter
    that he understood and therefore I find that the Judge's  determination
    cannot stand and must be set aside in its entirety.

18. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal Practice  Statement
    of the 25th of September 2012 the case may be  remitted  to  the  First
    Tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

         (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case to be put to and considered by the First-tier
         Tribunal; or

         (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

19. In this case I have determined that the case should be remitted because
    the Appellant did not have a  fair  hearing  due  to  the  lack  of  an
    interpreter that he understood. In this case none of  the  findings  of
    fact are to stand and the matter will be a complete re hearing.

20. I consequently remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal sitting
    at Manchester to be heard on a date to be fixed, before me.

21. I made the following directions for the resumed hearing ;

       . A Mirpuri interpreter to be instructed not Samina Azam (TRI1186339)

       . 2 hours
