Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mohamed Hasan, Solicitor, Kalam Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing her appeal against the decision by the Secretary of State to
    refuse to grant her leave to remain as a Tier 2 Migrant.  The  decision
    appealed against was made on 12  September  2014.   The  appellant  was
    refused leave to remain on the ground that her salary did not meet  the
    required threshold, as specified under Appendix A of  the  Rules.   The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I  do  not
    consider that the appellant requires anonymity for these proceedings in
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The Certificate of Sponsorship stated that her salary would be  �17,500
    per annum.  This is below the  minimum  required  salary  threshold  of
    �20,500 per annum as specified under Appendix FA.  The  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship  checking  service  entry  recorded  that  she  was   being
    sponsored as a nurse.  But there is no evidence that she would continue
    to be sponsored as a nurse or midwife by the  sponsor  after  achieving
    Nursing and Midwifery Council registration, and that her  salary  would
    not be less than �20,500 per year once that registration was  achieved.
    So she is not considered to be  exempt  from  meeting  the  appropriate
    salary requirements as detailed in Appendix A of the Rules.

 3. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Mazolowski sitting at  Bedford
    House in Belfast on 30 January 2015.  The appellant had  not  requested
    an oral hearing, so he determined the appeal on the papers.  I set  out
    below the judge's findings of fact and discussion of the evidence.

         "9.  According to the Appellant, she is single, aged 26 from Manila
             in the Philippines.  The Appellant obtained a  Masters  degree
             in Business Administration in Health Care Management from  the
             University of Wales in March 2012.  She now seeks to work with
             the  Alexander's  Care  and  Support  unit   in   Farnborough,
             Hampshire which is part of the Park Group of Residential Homes
             ("the Sponsor") as a supervised practice nurse earning �17,500
             p.a.

         10.  The Respondent refused the Appellant as detailed in paragraphs
             3 and 4 above.

         11.  The Appellant stated in her appeal that she  was  employed  by
             the Sponsor as a supervised practice nurse  and  she  produced
             the CoS with her appeal to that effect.  The  job  description
             summarised that the Appellant  was  to  professionally  assist
             care teams to meet the needs  of  purchasers  and  to  provide
             nursing care for them.  The Appellant argued that  the  salary
             paid by her  Sponsor  was  above  the  minimum  threshold  for
             sponsoring  a  supervised  practice  nurse.    The   Appellant
             produced  the  Respondent's  Codes  of  Practice  for  Skilled
             Workers dated 6 April 2014 (Code  of  Practice)  which  listed
             under the code number 2231 for Nurses the  first  entry  being
             "supervised practice nurses (Band 3 and equivalent) �16,271".

         12.  In her appeal the Appellant also produced the Sponsor's Tier 2
             Policy Guidance version from 6 April 2014.  At page 19 of  the
             policy guidance the  Sponsor  must  pay  Band  5  rate  salary
             (�21,388) if the  Appellant  achieves  full  NMC  registration
             having  undergone  a  period  of  supervised  practice  during
             sponsorship (also at page 3 of the Code of Practice).

         13.  In taking all of the above into account, at first  blush,  the
             Appellant would seem to meet the criterion of salary which was
             refused by the Respondent, provided  the  Appellant  can  show
             that she is a supervised practice  nurse.   The  problem  lies
             with this particular aspect of the refusal.   It  is  for  the
             Appellant  to  produce  evidence  that  she  is  a  supervised
             practice nurse.  Firstly, to call herself a nurse, she must be
             registered on the NMC and show her  PIN  number.   She  has  a
             British qualification in hospital management but she has shown
             no such qualification in nursing which is quite another issue.
              If she intends to be a student nurse,  which  is  a  form  of
             practice nurse, then her Sponsor  must  demonstrate  that  the
             appropriate  training  can  be  provided  by  this  group   of
             residential homes.  Residential  homes  per  se  do  not  have
             nursing staff in them,  as  care  homes  do.   Therefore,  the
             student training would have to be fully looked at.

         14.  On the other hand, it may well be (and it is not  revealed  by
             the Appellant) that the Appellant happened to have  a  nursing
             qualification from the Philippines, which is not recognised by
             the MNC without further  qualification  or  supervision  by  a
             suitably  qualified  and  experienced  nurse  in  the   United
             Kingdom.  I note that earlier at the  application  stage,  nor
             even now has the Appellant produced this evidence to  indicate
             who would be supervising her to allow her  to  fall  into  the
             category  of  supervised  practice   nurse.    The   CoS   job
             description  gives  little  comfort  and  sounds  as  if   the
             Appellant is attached to a  home  care  agency  but  there  is
             absolutely no mention at all of her being fully supervised  by
             a fully qualified nurse to satisfy  the  NMC  regulations.   I
             consider that it would be a requirement for the  Appellant  to
             show the nature of her work and the supervisory aspect  of  it
             and she has not done so.  The burden  of  proof  lies  on  the
             Appellant and so she must fail through lack of information.

         15.  On the totality of the evidence before me,  I  find  that  the
             Appellant has not discharged the burden of proof upon her  and
             the reasons given  by  the  Respondent  justify  the  refusal.
             Therefore  the  Respondent's  immigration   decision   is   in
             accordance with the law and the applicable immigration rules."

 4. On 28 April 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes granted the appellant
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal for the following reasons:

         "2.  Contrary to  the  submissions  in  the  grounds  the  decision
             appears perfectly clear and well-written.  Nevertheless  there
             is force in the argument at paragraphs  1,  2  and  3  of  the
             grounds  in  particular  that  the  judge  was  requiring  the
             appellant to produce evidence that she was indeed a supervised
             practice nurse (see [13] and [14]) when she was  so  described
             in the COS and that point was not taken by the respondent.

         3.   I have considered whether any error made by the judge could be
             said to be immaterial.  The point taken by the  respondent  in
             the reasons for refusal letter was that there was no  evidence
             that  the  appellant  would  continue  to  be  sponsored  once
             achieving NMC registration and then would have  the  necessary
             minimum salary.  The appellant's exhibit 3 suggests that  such
             continuation of sponsorship is necessary to achieve 20  points
             for appropriate salary.  I  observe  that  no  documents  were
             produced to the respondent  or  the  judge  to  evidence  such
             continuation of sponsorship and it is for this reason  that  I
             have  considered  whether  any  error  would   be   unarguably
             immaterial.   However  the  judge  does  not  appear  to  have
             considered the point specifically raised by  the  reasons  for
             refusal letter and it is arguable  as  set  out  at  ground  7
             (although the point may be in another  context)  that  if  the
             judge found necessary information was missing the judge should
             have considered the  provisions  of  paragraph  245AA  of  the
             rules/evidential  flexibility.   Accordingly  I  consider   it
             arguable that if the judge erred such  error  was  a  material
             one."

 5. On 15 May 2015 a member of the Specialist Appeals Team settled  a  Rule
    24 response opposing the appeal.  In summary,  he  submitted  that  the
    judge of the First-tier Tribunal  directed  himself  appropriately  and
    made reasonable sustainable findings that were properly open to him  on
    the evidence.  The grounds contended that he erred in failing to  apply
    paragraph 245AA  of  the  Rules  to  the  missing  evidence.   But  the
    application of 245AA would not have led to a grant of leave because the
    appellant's application was defective.  Paragraph 245AA would not  have
    assisted the appellant, given that the missing evidence  had  not  been
    submitted and given that  it  was  not  a  question  of  the  documents
    submitted being  in  the  wrong  format  as  was  envisaged  under  the
    Immigration Rule.

 6. Before me, Mr Duffy acknowledged that the judge had been wrong to  find
    that the burden rested with the appellant to show  the  nature  of  her
    work and the supervisory aspect of it,  and  wrong  to  find  that  her
    appeal failed because she had not produced evidence to  show  that  she
    was a supervised practice nurse.  But he submitted that the  error  was
    not material as the Certificate of Sponsorship  clearly  did  not  show
    what it was required to show in order for the appellant  to  be  exempt
    from being paid an appropriate salary of at least �20,500 per annum. So
    the judge had been right to find that the appellant had not  discharged
    the burden of proving that the  appeal  should  be  allowed  under  the
    Rules.

Discussion

 7. As I informed the parties at the end of the hearing, this appeal  falls
    to be dismissed.  It is an indisputable fact that  the  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship viewed  by  the  Secretary  of  State  when  assessing  the
    application  did  not  contain  the  mandatory  information  that   the
    appellant was going to continue to be sponsored as a nurse  or  midwife
    by  the  sponsor  after  achieving  a  Nursing  and  Midwifery  Council
    registration, or that her salary would be not  less  than  �20,500  per
    year  once  that  registration  was  achieved.   The   Certificate   of
    Sponsorship checking service entry was completely silent on  these  two
    aspects.

 8. Mr Hasan's submission is that the Secretary of State  should  not  have
    made a decision about compliance with the  Rules  before  investigating
    with the appellant whether she could  produce  evidence  to  show  that
    these two additional requirements could in fact be satisfied.  I reject
    this submission for the reasons given below.

 9. Paragraph 245AA does not  bite,  as  this  is  not  a  case  where  the
    appellant is required to provide a specified document.  This is a  case
    where  the  onus  is  on  the  sponsor  to  provide  a  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship which shows that the applicant  is  going  to  be  paid  an
    appropriate salary; and, if not, that  the  applicant  is  exempt  from
    being paid �20,500 at this stage because  the  additional  requirements
    referred to in the decision letter are met.

10. Paragraph 79A of Appendix FA of the Rules as they stood at the date  of
    decision provided that  no  points  would  be  awarded  if  the  salary
    referred to in paragraph 79 above  was  less  than  �20,500  per  year,
    unless:

         '(b)     The Certificate  of  Sponsorship  checking  service  entry
             records the  applicant  has  been  sponsored  as  a  nurse  or
             midwife, will continue to be sponsored as a nurse  or  midwife
             by the sponsor after achieving Nursing and  Midwifery  Council
             registration, and the salary will not be less than �20,500 per
             year once that registration is achieved.'

11. The present version of this Rule distinguishes between the recording of
    this information, and the provision of  evidence  to  support  what  is
    recorded in the Certificate of Sponsorship checking service  entry.  If
    the  Certificate  of  Sponsorship  had  recorded   all   the   required
    information, it would have been wrong for the  Secretary  of  State  to
    reject what was recorded  without  the  appellant  being  afforded  the
    opportunity to provide evidence to support the entry.  But  here  there
    was no record in the first place, so there was no good reason  for  the
    Secretary of State to afford the appellant the opportunity  to  provide
    evidence that she would continue to be sponsored  as  a  nurse  by  the
    sponsor after achieving Nursing and Midwifery Council registration etc.
     So there was no breach of paragraph  245AA,  and  there  was  also  no
    breach of the Secretary of State's common law duty of fairness  in  the
    Secretary  of  State  assessing  the  application  on  the  information
    recorded  in  the  Certificate  of  Sponsorship,  without  giving   the
    appellant or the sponsor the opportunity to amend what was recorded  in
    the Certificate of Sponsorship checking entry, still  less  to  provide
    evidence on matters about which the entry was completely silent.

12. Accordingly, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
    appeal under the Rules is not vitiated by a material error of law  such
    that the decision should be set aside and remade.  Albeit that  it  was
    erroneously reasoned, the decision was right in substance and the  only
    decision that the First-tier Tribunal could have reached.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain an error of law  and
accordingly the decision stands.  This  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
