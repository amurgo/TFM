Representation:
For the Claimant: Mr B Davison (Solicitor)
For the Secretary of State: Mrs Petterson  (Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Kelly promulgated on the 30th  November  2015,  in
      which he allowed the Claimant's  appeal  against  his  deportation  on
      human rights grounds under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1988,  on
      account of his relationship with his partner and two children, one  of
      whom J. suffers from a severe medical condition and the  unduly  harsh
      effect the Claimant's deportation would have upon them.  Mrs Petterson
      on behalf of the Secretary of State made numerous concessions in  this
      appeal.

   2. Permission to appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
      Kelly has been granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Page  on  the  7th
      January 2016.  Although this is the Secretary of State's  appeal,  for
      the purposes of clarity throughout this decision, I will refer  to  Mr
      B, the Appellant in the First-tier Tribunal, as "the Claimant", and  I
      will refer to the Secretary as "the Secretary of State".

      Background

   3. The Claimant is a national of the Democratic Republic  of  Congo,  who
      was born on the 6th June 1992 and who is therefore now aged  23  years
      old.  The Claimant arrived in United Kingdom  on  the  27th  September
      1999 and initially claimed asylum.  That asylum claim was  refused  on
      the 20th June 2001 that the Claimant sought  to  appeal  against  that
      decision.  Although his initial appeal was dismissed on the 11th March
      2003, following an appeal to the  Immigration  Appeals  Tribunal,  his
      case was remitted on the 10th November 2003 and on the  25th  February
      2005 the Home Office withdrew the decision.  On the 4th April 2005 the
      Claimant was granted Discretionary Leave until  the  4th  April  2008.
      The Claimant was then granted Indefinite  Leave  to  Enter  under  the
      Family ILR exercise on the 18th August 2005.

   4. On the 5th December 2006, when aged 14 years  old,  the  Claimant  was
      convicted of possessing  Cannabis,  a  Class  C  controlled  drug  and
      possessing an offensive weapon at Leeds District  Juvenile  Court,  in
      respect of  which  he  received  a  3  month  referral  order  to  run
      concurrently for both offences.  On the 28th  February  2007,  he  was
      convicted of possessing a controlled drug with intent to supply  Class
      A Crack Cocaine, possessing a controlled drug with  intent  to  supply
      Class C and possessing criminal property at  Leeds  District  Juvenile
      Court, in respect of which he  received  a  supervision  order  (Young
      Offenders) of 12 months duration; an order to participate in specified
      activities; a curfew order and electronic tagging.  On the 27th  April
      2007, he was convicted of robbery at Leeds District Juvenile Court and
      was sentenced to a curfew order for 4 months with electronic  tagging.
      On the 18th February 2008 he was convicted of possessing a  controlled
      drug with intent to supply Class A heroin, supplying a controlled drug
      Class A Crack Cocaine, supplying a controlled drug Class A heroin  and
      possession with intent to supply a Class C controlled  drug  at  Leeds
      Crown Court.  He was sentenced to a 24 month  detention  and  training
      order.  On the 13th May 2010 the Claimant was  convicted  of  burglary
      and theft of a dwelling at  Leeds  District  Juvenile  Court  and  was
      sentenced on the 3rd June 2010 to a youth rehabilitation order for  60
      hours unpaid work.  His final conviction was on the 8th December 2013,
      in respect of  possessing  a  controlled  drug  Class  B  amphetamine,
      possessing a controlled  drug  Class  B  cannabis/cannabis  resin  and
      failing to surrender  to  custody  at  an  appointed  time,  at  Leeds
      District Magistrates Court, in respect of which he was sentenced to  a
      fine of �65, cost of �85 and the victim surcharge of �15.

   5. The Claimant was initially served with  a  liability  for  deportation
      letter on  the  27th  March  2008,  and  on  the  18th  June  2013,  a
      Deportation Order was signed  against  him.   The  Claimant  submitted
      representations as to why the Deportation Order should be revoked, and
      on the 9th December 2013 the decision was made to refuse to revoke the
      Deportation Order.  A Judicial Review was submitted by the Claimant on
      the 11th March 2014 against the refusal decision to refuse  to  revoke
      the  Deportation  Order  and  against  the  decision  to  certify  the
      deportation under Section  94  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002, denying an in country right of  appeal.   On  1  July
      2014, a consent order was signed giving the  Claimant  an  in  country
      right of appeal in respect of the  decision  dated  the  9th  December
      2013, and his claim was considered on basis of him having made both  a
      Protection Claim and Human Rights Claim.

   6. That led to the decision of the Secretary of State on the  26th  March
      2015, which formed the basis of  the  appeal  to  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Kelly.  Within that original decision by the Secretary of State,
      it was stated that the Claimant had not fully explained  his  fear  of
      returning to the DRC or provided evidence of  substantiate  his  claim
      and therefore it was not accepted that he had a  genuine  well-founded
      fear of persecution in the DRC.  In respect of his Article 8 claim  in
      respect of his family life  with  his  children  as  considered  under
      paragraph 339 (a) of the Immigration Rules, it was accepted  that  the
      Claimant's son J. was a British Citizen, given  that  his  mother  was
      British, and that J. had been born on the 24th January  2011  and  was
      therefore under the age of 18 and that because J. suffered from severe
      haemophilia B, it would be unduly harsh to expect J. to return to  the
      DRC with the Claimant, but it was considered  that  it  would  not  be
      unduly harsh for J. to remain in the UK even  though  his  father  was
      being deported to the DRC, given that he would remain in the  UK  with
      one of his primary carers, namely his mother.

   7. In respect of the Claimant's claim against his deportation in  respect
      of his family life with a partner for the purposes  of  paragraph  339
      (b) of the Immigration Rules, it was not accepted  that  it  would  be
      unduly harsh for the Claimant's partner Ms R. to live in  the  DRC  if
      she chose to do so, although she was a British Citizen  and  that  she
      could access the support of social services and the benefit system  in
      the UK.  It was found that it would not be unduly harsh for  Ms  R  to
      remain in the UK even though the Claimant was to be deported.

   8. It was further found that in respect of the  Claimant's  private  life
      considered under paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules, although  it
      was accepted that the Claimant have been lawfully resident in  the  UK
      for most of his life, it was stated that the Claimant  had  failed  to
      provide any evidence that he was socially  and  culturally  integrated
      into the UK  and  it  was  not  accepted  that  there  would  be  very
      significant obstacles to his integration into the country to which  it
      was proposed that he be returned, namely the DRC, given  that  he  had
      resided in the DRC until the age of 8 years old.

   9. The Claimant sought to appeal that decision, which appeal was heard by
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly.




      The First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision

  10. In his decision promulgated on  the  30th  November  2015,  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Kelly noted how  the  Claimant  is  a  citizen  of  the
      Democratic Republic of Congo and that  he  had  abandoned  his  appeal
      against a refusal of his protection claim, but pursued a claim  solely
      on the basis of his Human Rights in respect of his right  for  private
      and family life under Article 8 and that his removal  would  therefore
      be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1988.

  11. First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly found that as a result of the  changes
      to the rights of  appeal  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, following the introduction of section
      15 of the Immigration Act 2014, that it was no longer possible  for  a
      person to  appeal  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  a
      deportation case on the ground that "it is not in accordance with  the
      Immigration Rules" and that in  such  circumstances  when  considering
      whether or not the Human Rights under Article 8 of a person who  would
      otherwise be liable for deportation would be breached if they were  to
      be  removed,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  therefore  cannot   now
      consider, given the new restrictive appeal rights,  the  appeal  under
      paragraphs 397, 398, 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules,  and  that
      he had to consider it purely under Article 8 terms,  applying  section
      117A-D of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  in
      particular section 117C, in respect of  a  person  who  is  liable  to
      deportation.

  12. First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly set out the Claimant's criminality  in
      full.  However,  notwithstanding  the  Claimant's  criminality,  Judge
      Kelly found that both  Exception  1  and  Exception  2  under  section
      117C(4) and (5) applied.  In respect of  Exception  1  he  found  that
      Claimant had been lawfully resident in the UK for most  of  his  life;
      that he was  socially  and  culturally  integrating  into  the  United
      Kingdom and that there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
      integration into the country to which  it  was  proposed  he  will  be
      deported.  It was found by Judge Kelly that Exception 2 also  applied,
      taking into account in particular, the severe health problems suffered
      by the  Claimant's  son  J.  He  found  the  Claimant  had  a  genuine
      subsisting relationship with both a qualifying partner and  a  genuine
      parental relationship with two qualifying children and that the effect
      of his deportation on the partner and children would be unduly  harsh.
      He  therefore  allowed  the  appeal  on  Human  Rights  Grounds.   The
      Secretary of State has sought to appeal that  decision  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal.

      The Grounds of Appeal

  13. Within the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal it is argued by the
      Secretary of State that under Ground 1 the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      failed to give  reasons  or  any  adequate  reasons  for  findings  on
      material matters.  It is argued that the Judge failed to give adequate
      reasons for finding that it would be unduly harsh  on  the  Claimant's
      partner and children to remain in the United Kingdom without him.

  14. It is further argued that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to
      recognise  the  precise  wording  of  paragraph   399(b)(i)   of   the
      Immigration Rules, and that it is argued that the relationship had  to
      be formed at a time when the Claimant (the deportee)  was  in  the  UK
      lawfully and their immigration  status  was  not  precarious.   It  is
      argued that having embarked upon a course of criminality in 2006,  the
      Claimant's immigration status was precarious from that  date  onwards,
      following the Upper Tribunal case of AM (Section 117B)  Malawi  [2015]
      UK UT 0260 (IAC); that the Claimant and  his  partner  did  not  begin
      their relationship until 2010 and they did not  co-habit  until  2013.
      It is argued that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  provide
      adequate reasons for finding that the  Claimant's  immigration  status
      was not precarious when the relationship was formed and it  is  argued
      that the requirements of paragraph 399(b)(i)  were  not  met.   It  is
      argued that the Judge's failure to engage with the  Immigration  Rules
      is an error of law which was material to the outcome of the appeal.

  15. It is next argued that the Judge's analysis of "unduly harsh" at  [41]
      is inadequately reasoned and demonstrated a lack  of  appreciation  of
      the relationship between Exceptions  1  and  2  contained  within  the
      Immigration Rules and section 117C.   It  is  argued  that  the  Judge
      failed to consider the importance of criminality in the assessment  of
      his social and  cultural  integration  for  the  purposes  of  section
      117C(4)(b).  It is further argued that by  the  First-tier  Judge  not
      relying upon and criticising the Upper Tribunal case of  KMO  (Section
      117 - unduly harsh) [2015] UK UT 00543  (IAC),  ignored  the  critical
      analysis in that case between paragraphs 15 and 24, and failed to give
      effect to the principle that "the more serious the  offence  committed
      by the foreign  criminal,  the  greater  is  the  public  interest  in
      deportation of the criminal".  It is argued that the Judge  failed  to
      provide reasons as to why the Claimant's deportation would lead to "an
      inordinately or excessively harsh" consequences  to  his  partner  and
      children, if they were to remain in the UK without him.  It is  argued
      that the Judge failed  to  provide  any  reasons  why  at  [43],   the
      potential of state assistance was insufficient to  meet  the  family's
      financial and medical needs. It is further  argued  that  the  Judge's
      analysis of section 117C(4)(c) lacks adequate  reasons  and  does  not
      focus on the balancing exercise.

  16. Within ground 2 of the grounds of appeal, it is argued that in respect
      of exception 1 at section 117C(4)  that  the  Claimant  had  not  been
      lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life.  It is said that  he
      was aged 23 years old at the date of the appeal hearing  and  that  he
      was first granted leave to remain in the UK on the 4th April 2005  and
      was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain on the 18th August
      2008.  It is said that on the 18th June 2013 the Deportation Order was
      signed against him, thus bringing his lawful residence in the UK to an
      end and that therefore his lawful residence in the UK is  eight  years
      and two months, less than half of his life.   It  is  said  that  this
      material error of fact led to a material error regarding  the  Judge's
      consideration of Exception 1.

  17. Within ground 3 it is argued that the First-tier Judge failed to  have
      due regard to the multi-faceted nature of the public interest  in  the
      deportation of foreign  national  offenders  and  that  there  was  no
      consideration of the public revulsion to  criminal  behaviour  or  the
      need to deter other foreign criminals as expressed at paragraph 20  of
      the case of Danso v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]
      EWCA Civ 596.

      The Grant of Permission to Appeal

  18. Within the grant of permission to appeal it was stated  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Page that:

      "...I have read the Judge's decision and have not  found  it  an  easy
      decision to follow.  The reasoning in  the  Judge's  decision  appears
      complicated.  At paragraph 8 the Judge said that his  conclusions  are
      contrary to those expressed by the Upper Tribunal in Bossade  (Section
      117A-D Inter-relationship with Rules) [2015] UK  UT  415.   The  Judge
      said that he had not followed the Tribunal's approach in Bossade  when
      assessing the Claimant's  Human  Rights  claim  and  had  gone  on  at
      paragraphs thereafter to conclude at paragraph 41 that Parliament  did
      not intend the consequences brought upon the Claimant that his  family
      by the Secretary of State's decision.   Various  questions  have  been
      raised by the Judge as to whether the authorities referred to  in  the
      decision were 'rightly decided'.  I am in agreement with the Secretary
      of State's complaint that  the  Judge's  decision  is  not  adequately
      reasoned.  If, contrary to the Judge's view,  these  authorities  were
      rightly decided, then there are arguable errors in law in the  Judge's
      decision".

      The Rule 24 Reply

  19. Within the Claimant's Rule 24 reply, it  is  argued  that  it  is  not
      accepted that there was any  lack  of  precision  in  the  wording  or
      account of the decision, such as to amount to a material error in law.
       It is argued that the Judge has  properly  directed  himself  to  the
      appropriate section of the statute at [9], and has  at  [8]  and  [41]
      particularly, directing himself as to the judicial authorities in  the
      interpretation of the public  interest  considerations  laid  down  by
      Parliament and what constitutes a  removal/deportation  being  "unduly
      harsh".  It is argued that the Judge has not simply indicated that the
      case of  Bossade  was  concluded  incorrectly,  but  rather  that  the
      conclusions as reached in that case are  affected  by  the  change  in
      sections 82 and 84 of the 2002 Act,  since  the  time  that  case  was
      decided.

  20. It is further argued in the Claimant's Rule 24 reply  that  the  Judge
      between  paragraphs  [5]  and  [7]  has  set  out  the  scope  of  his
      consideration of the appeal before him, in that it was now limited  to
      consideration as to whether or not the Secretary of  State's  decision
      was in breach of the Claimant's Human  Rights  and  this  was  not  an
      appeal on the basis of whether or not the decision was  correct  under
      the Immigration Rules.  It is argued that the Judge had also  set  out
      his consideration as to whether or not the decision would  be  "unduly
      harsh" in his discussion between [27] and [44] and that  at  [43]  the
      Judge had referred back to  [15]  as  to  why  he  had  concluded  the
      deportation would be unduly harsh.  It is said that  the  decision  is
      lengthy and potentially longer than necessary, but that the  reasoning
      behind it is sufficiently clear and does not contain a material  error
      of law.

      The Oral Submissions

  21. Mrs Petterson on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  made  numerous
      concessions in this appeal.

  22. Mrs Petterson agreed that in this case the Judge  was  considering  an
      appeal under the  new  limited  grounds  of  appeal  contained  within
      section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and
      that the Judge therefore was not in a position to consider whether  or
      not the appeal should be allowed under "the Immigration Rules"  or  on
      the basis of the decision "not being in accordance with the law".  She
      agreed that the Firs-tier Tribunal Judge simply had to decide  whether
      or not the decision was unlawful under section 6 of the  Human  Rights
      Act 1988, under the new grounds of appeal set out within section 84 of
      the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  following  the
      refusal of the Claimant's Human Rights claim.

  23. Mrs Petterson argued that  in  considering  the  case  in  respect  of
      Article 8,  this  had  to  be  viewed  through  the  "prison"  of  the
      Immigration Rules. She argued that if the  requirements  of  paragraph
      399 of the Immigration Rules were not met, then there would have to be
      exceptional circumstances to say that Article  8  was  breached.   Mrs
      Petterson  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  argued  that  in
      considering the Article  8  claim,  the  Judge  had  to  consider  the
      provisions of sections 117A-D  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002, in considering  the  proportionality  assessment,  as
      these were mandatory requirements.  Mrs Petterson submitted  that  the
      Immigration Rules had been amended to bring them in line with  section
      117A-D.

  24. Mrs Petterson on behalf of the Secretary of State said  that  as  this
      was an appeal being considered under the  new  restrictive  rights  of
      appeal, she was not seeking to argue on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
      State that the Judge had erred in law in failing to decide the  appeal
      as "not being in accordance with the Immigration Rules" or  "otherwise
      not in accordance with the Law".  Nor was she seeking  to  argue  that
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in not considering  the
      requirements of paragraph 399, when he  had  taken  into  account  the
      considerations under section  117A-D,  which  had  to  be  taken  into
      account by him, to the extent that the  Rules  matched  the  Statutory
      provisions.

  25. Both parties further agreed that  the  case  of  Bossade  was  decided
      before the appeal rights had changed, and  that  therefore  that  case
      dealt with the situation when an appeal was being  brought  under  the
      Immigration Rules  under  the  old  appeal  rights,  rather  than  the
      situation in this case where the appeal was being brought on the  much
      more restricted new rights of appeal.

  26. In respect of Exception 1, Mr Davison agreed  that  the  Claimant  had
      been lawfully resident for less than half of his life in the  UK,  but
      sought to argue in this regard that the Secretary of State had made  a
      concession that the Claimant had been resident for more than  half  of
      his life and that it was not for the Judge to correct the Secretary of
      State's mistakes, or to go looking for errors in the concessions  that
      have been made.

  27. In this regard Mrs Petterson said that there  had  been  a  concession
      made at paragraph 51 of the Refusal Letter, but that she did not  know
      what submissions had been raised  in  that  regard  before  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Kelly.  She argued that if it had been argued, then  it
      should have been dealt with, but it  was  not  clear  that  the  issue
      regarding there being an error  in  the  concession  had  been  argued
      before him.  She was not in a position to say that any concession  was
      withdrawn.  She did argue that there was clearly an error  there,  but
      as she was not in a position to  say  that  this  had  been  canvassed
      before First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly.  Mrs Petterson told me that in
      such circumstances he was not saying that this amounted to a  material
      error of law, given the  concession  that  had  been  originally  made
      within the refusal notice.

  28. In respect of the issue as to whether or not the Claimant was socially
      and culturally integrated  into  the  United  Kingdom,  Mrs  Petterson
      argued that the Claimant's criminality fed into  the  question  as  to
      whether or not he was socially and culturally integrated and that this
      also needed to be factored in when considering whether  or  not  there
      had been lawful residence for the purposes of Section  117C(4)(a)  and
      (b).  She argued that the Judge had failed  to  take  account  of  the
      Claimant's offending behaviour since 2006, which  led  to  the  actual
      conviction in 2008 and further convictions which were  dealt  with  at
      [42] of the decision and that the Judge had attached too little weight
      to the convictions that led to a non-custodial sentence.  In reply  on
      this point, Mr Davison argued that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had
      set out the Claimant's criminality at [28] and he argued  clearly  had
      the criminality in mind  when  making  these  findings  and  that  the
      finding that the Claimant was socially and culturally integrating here
      was a finding that was open to him.  He submitted that the  Judge  had
      set out the full extent of the Claimant's criminality at [13] and  the
      extent of his family life at [14].

  29. In respect of whether or not there were very significant obstacles  to
      the Claimant's integration into the country to which it  was  proposed
      that he be deported  for  the  purposes  of  section  117C(4)(c),  Mrs
      Petterson sought to argue that the Judge had failed to mention  within
      his decision what those very significant  obstacles  might  be,  apart
      from him having a lack of a network in the DRC.  She argued  that  the
      Judge had failed to take account of the fact that  he  had  no  health
      problems and had benefitted from a UK education, which he could use in
      the DRC.  In this regard Mr Davison sought to argue that the Judge had
      identified precisely what the "very significant obstacles"  were,  and
      had described how the Claimant would in effect be "being sent back  to
      an entirely alien territory", and the fact that he had a good  English
      education did not alter that fact.

  30. In respect of the question as to whether or not Exception  2  applied,
      Mrs Petterson sought to argue that in consideration as to  whether  or
      not it would be unduly harsh for the Claimant's partner  and  children
      to remain in the UK without him, the fact  that  they  might  struggle
      given the fact that one  of  the  children  suffered  from  a  medical
      condition and that they might have to live on welfare,  did  not  mean
      that it was unduly harsh and that many people struggle with  financial
      problems and have  young  children  or  children  who  are  ill.   Mrs
      Petterson stated specifically that she was not pursuing  the  argument
      contained within the grounds of appeal that the Judge materially erred
      in not following the case of KMO, given that the Judge had  considered
      the question as to the Claimant's criminality in  any  event  in  that
      regard at [42] of the Judgment.

  31. Mr Davison argued that the Judge had given ample reasons as to why the
      decision would be unduly harsh on the sponsor and  children,  if  they
      were to be left in the UK without the Claimant and that the Judge  had
      given adequate and sufficient reasons for his findings regarding undue
      harshness and that the Secretary of State's arguments in  this  regard
      simply amounted to a disagreement with the reasons.

      My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

  32. Given that the initial decision of the Secretary of State in this case
      is dated the 12th March 2015, it  thereby  post-dates  the  amendments
      brought about in respect of the grounds of appeal and the  restriction
      in the rights of appeal in deportation cases  in  general  which  came
      into effect under the Immigration Act 2014 on the 10th November 2014.

  33. As a result of section 15 of the Immigration Act 2014, section 8(2) of
      the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 has been  amended  so
      that the right of appeal to the Tribunal now  only  exists  where  the
      Secretary of State has decided to:

      (a) refuse a protection claim made by P;

      (b) decided to refuse a Human Rights claim by P, or

      (c) decided to revoke P's protection status.

  34. Further, pursuant to section 15, the grounds of appeal  under  section
      84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  have  equally
      been restricted so that now, under  the  amended  wording  of  section
      84(2) an Appeal under section 82(1)(b) (refusal of Human Rights claim)
      must be brought on the ground that  the  decision  is  unlawful  under
      section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  The old wording of section 84
      in respect of the grounds of appeal and in particular section 84(1)(a)
      that the decision was 'not in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules'
      and section 84(1)(e) that the decision is 'otherwise not in accordance
      with the law', have been  removed.   In  such  circumstances,  as  Mrs
      Petterson quite properly pointed out on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
      State, this was an appeal to which the new limited rights and  grounds
      of appeal applied, given the date of the original decision, such  that
      the Claimant could now only appeal under the new  wording  of  section
      84(2) in respect of the refusal of his  Human  Rights  claim,  on  the
      ground that the decision is unlawful under  section  6  of  the  Human
      Rights Act 1998.  The Claimant no longer had the right to  argue  that
      the decision made by the Secretary of State  was  'not  in  accordance
      with the Immigration Rules' or 'otherwise not in accordance  with  the
      law'.

  35. Although the Claimant was not as result of the new appeal rights, able
      to argue that the decision was 'not in accordance with the Immigration
      Rules', I do agree with Mrs Petterson that in considering  the  appeal
      on Human Rights grounds,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  still  had
      considered the case through the prism of the Immigration Rules.

  36. The Upper Tribunal in the case of Bossade (Sections  117A-D  -  Inter-
      relationship with  Rules)  [2015]  UK  UT  00415  (IAC)  decided  that
      "ordinarily a court or tribunal will, as a first  stage,  consider  an
      Appellant's Article 8 claim by reference to the Immigration Rules that
      set out substantial conditions, without any direct reference  to  Part
      5A considerations.  Such considerations have no direct application  to
      rules of this kind.  Part 5A considerations only have direct effect at
      the second stage of the Article 8 analysis.  That method  of  approach
      does not amount to  according  priority  to  the  Rules  over  primary
      legislation but rather of recognising their different  functions"  and
      that "...in  the  context  of  foreign  criminal  cases  (because  the
      provisions found in Part of the Rules are a complete code encompassing
      both stages of the Article 8 assessment),  this  means  that  Part  5A
      considerations have no direct role at the first stage when a court  or
      tribunal is  deciding  whether  an  applicant  meets  the  substantive
      conditions of paragraphs 339 or 339A of the Immigration  Rules.   They
      only have direct application at  the  second  stage,  viz.  assessment
      under the Rules  that  involves  a  proportionality  assessment:  viz.
      paragraph 398 and (in revocation  cases)  paragraph  390A.   In  cases
      other than those concerning deportation of  foreign  criminals,  where
      the Rules are not a complete  code,  it  may  still  be  necessary  to
      conduct this second stage outside of the Rules".

  37. The case of Bossade dealt with the situation where  the  Secretary  of
      State had made a Deportation Order on the 23rd July  2013,  such  that
      the old appeal rights in that case applied.  That case  did  not  deal
      with the situation under the new restricted appeal rights and  grounds
      following the amendment to sections 82  and  84  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and the restriction in the grounds of
      appeal, such that the Appellants could no longer appeal on  the  basis
      that the decision was 'not in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules'
      or 'otherwise not in accordance with the law.'

  38. In the context of Article 8 in visitor visa appeals  when  considering
      the new limited Appeal Rights, the Upper  Tribunal  in  the  cases  of
      Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015]  UKUT  00112  (IAC)  and
      Adjei (visit visas-Article 8) [2015] UKUT  0261  (IAC),  decided  that
      when considering the Article 8 question  outside  of  the  Immigration
      Rules, this has to be considered through the lens of  the  Immigration
      Rules. Therefore, if Article 8 is engaged in such a case, the Tribunal
      will need to look at the extent to which  the  Rules  were  satisfied,
      even though not considering the appeal on the basis as to  whether  or
      not the decision was "in accordance with Immigration Rules", or on the
      basis as to whether or not the decision was "otherwise  in  accordance
      with the law".  The extent to which the Rules were met  was  a  factor
      that would inform the proportionality assessment when considering  the
      Article 8 issue.

  39. In my judgment, the Tribunal has to  adopt  a  similar  approach  when
      considering whether there  has  been  a  breach  of  Article  8  in  a
      deportation case, and the Article 8 assessment still has to be  looked
      at through the lens of the Immigration Rules in respect of  paragraphs
      397 to 399A.  As was previously stated by the Court of Appeal  in  the
      case of MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 that the Immigration Rules were a  complete  code
      in respect of the assessment of  an  Article  8  claim  brought  by  a
      foreign criminal. I do not consider that the requirements of the Rules
      can be ignored simply given the changes in  the  appeal  rights.   The
      fact that the appeal, if allowed, would now be granted on the basis of
      the decision not been accordance with the appellant's human rights and
      the decision being contrary to Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998,
      as opposed to "not  been  accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules"or
      "otherwise not in accordance with the law"  does  not  mean  that  the
      provisions of paragraphs 397 to 399A should be ignored.  The  question
      as to whether or not the provisions of the Rules  on  deportation  are
      met has to form the basis of the consideration  of  the  Human  Rights
      issue under Article 8.

  40. The cases of both Bossade and MF Nigeria therefore do remain correctly
      decided, even though  the  ultimate  answer  would  be  now  that  the
      decision was unlawful under section 6 of the Human  Rights  Act  1990,
      rather than being either  "not  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
      Rules" or "otherwise not in accordance with the law."  Given  that  as
      stated by the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for
      the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 that the codification of  the
      Immigration Rules in respect  of  Deportation  is  intended  to  be  a
      "Complete Code", it is  hard  to  envisage  that  even  with  the  new
      restricted appeal rights, that there might be  circumstances  where  a
      Claimant who failed to meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
      in respect of deportation would be able to successfully establish  the
      decision was unlawful under section 6.  The Tribunal still has to look
      at the Rules as a "Complete Code", and to use the Rules  as  informing
      the decision on the Human Rights issue, in respect of Article 8.

  41. In such circumstances, although First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  did
      properly consider the question as to whether or not the  decision  was
      unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, I do find  that
      he did err in law in failing to take into account the extent to  which
      the provisions of paragraph 397 to 399A of the Immigration Rules  were
      met, when reaching his  decision  on  proportionality  and  breach  of
      Article 8 and consequent breach of section 6 of the Human Rights Act.

  42. However, as was quite properly conceded by Mrs Petterson on behalf  of
      the  Secretary  of  State,  given  that  the  provisions  within   the
      Immigration  Rules  within  paragraph  397  to  399A  in  respect   of
      deportation have been amended to bring them in line with sections 117A-
      D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  the  error  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly in this regard may not necessarily  be
      material, if in looking at the case solely in line with section 117 A-
      D, he has considered and applied the criteria that  should  have  been
      that should have been looked at by him under paragraphs 397 to 399A.

  43. In respect of Exception 1, which was considered by First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Kelly under section 117 C (4) the wording of that paragraph does
      mirror exactly the provisions in paragraphs 399A  of  the  Immigration
      Rules.  Therefore, the error of First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly in not
      considering the provisions of paragraph 399A does not in itself amount
      to material error, given that he has clearly considered the wording of
      the identical provision under section 117C(4).

  44. When First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly looked at the appeal  in  respect
      of Exception 1 under section 117C(4) Mrs Petterson conceded  that  she
      could not say whether or not the error in terms of the concession that
      had been made by the  Secretary  of  State  at  paragraph  51  of  the
      decision, namely that the Claimant had been lawfully  in  the  UK  for
      more than half his life, had  been  withdrawn.  She  therefore  stated
      specifically that she could not argue that the Judge materially  erred
      by relying upon that concession, even though in fact the Claimant  had
      not been lawfully resident within the UK for more  than  half  of  his
      life.

  45.  I do find that the Judge did err in finding  that  the  Claimant  had
      been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life, given  that  he
      was 23 years old at the date of the hearing and had been first granted
      leave to remain in the UK on the 4th April 2005 and  was  subsequently
      granted indefinite leave to remain on the 18th August  2008,  but  was
      served with a Deportation Order on the 18th June 2013, meaning that he
      had been lawfully in the UK for eight years and two months, less  than
      half of his life. However, given that this resulted from a  concession
      wrongly made by the Secretary of State, , I do not find that there  is
      a material error in Judge Kelly's decision in  him  relying  upon  the
      concession made by the Secretary of State in the  refusal  letter,  as
      conceded by Mrs Petterson on behalf of the Secretary of State.

  46. In respect of the second limb for Exception 1, in terms of whether  or
      not the Claimant was socially and culturally integrated into  the  UK,
      although in this regard the Secretary of  State  seeks  to  rely  upon
      paragraph 33 of the decision of the Upper Tribunal in the case  of  AM
      (Section 117B) Malawi [2015] UK UT 0260 (IAC), that paragraph  of  the
      Upper Tribunal's decision was dealing with whether or not  a  person's
      status in the UK was 'precarious' as opposed to  whether  or  not  the
      Claimant was 'socially and  culturally  integrated'  into  the  United
      Kingdom.  Clearly a Claimant's criminality may well  impact  upon  the
      extent to which he is socially and/or culturally integrated  into  the
      United Kingdom, but criminality in itself is not necessarily a bar per
      se to a person being socially and/or culturally  integrated  into  the
      UK. In this regard, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Kelly  clearly  had  in
      mind the Claimant's criminality, which he had set out in full at  [13]
      of his decision,  but  nevertheless  had  given  clear,  adequate  and
      sufficient reasons at [33] as to why he found that  the  Claimant  had
      been socially and culturally integrated into the UK in  terms  of  the
      Claimant having lived and been educated in the  United  Kingdom  since
      the age of eight years old and the work which he had undertaken within
      his local community. This was a finding that was open to  him  on  the
      evidence.

  47. In respect of the argument that the  Judge's  analysis  under  section
      117C(4)(c) lacked adequate  reasons  and  focused  upon  the  negative
      rather than a balancing exercise, in terms of  whether  or  not  there
      would be very significant obstacles to the Claimant's integration into
      the country to which it was proposed he would be deported, I find that
      the Judge has given sufficient and adequate reasons for  his  findings
      in this regard at [33] of the decision.  The Judge specifically  noted
      how the Claimant had only retained a limited residual knowledge of the
      French language and that he  did  not  have  any  social  or  familial
      network or support within the DRC.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kelly
      also how his removal to that country and subsequent exclusion from the
      UK for a period of 10 years would in the Judge's  opinion,  amount  to
      exiling him to an entirely alien territory, in circumstances where  he
      had lived and had been educated in the UK since the age of eight years
      old.

  48. Therefore, although First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly did err in finding
      that Exception 1 applied, on the mistaken  belief  that  the  Claimant
      have been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his  life,  for  the
      reasons set out above and in light  of  the  concession  made  by  Mrs
      Petterson on behalf of the Secretary of State, I do not find that this
      amounts to a material error of law.

  49. In any event, for the reasons set out below, the Judge's  findings  in
      respect of Exception  2  in  respect  of  his  relationship  with  his
      children and the unduly harsh effect upon them of his  deportation  in
      respect of the very particular circumstances of this case, I find were
      open to him and do not disclose  a  material  error  of  law  for  the
      reasons discussed below. In such circumstances, although the Judge did
      err in respect of Exception 1, given that I find the Judge's reasoning
      in respect of Exception 2 in respect  of  his  relationship  with  his
      children and the effect of his deportation on them were both  adequate
      and sufficient and open to him for the reasons  set  out  below,  such
      that any error in respect of Exception 1 is not material.

  50.  In  considering  Exception  2,  in  terms  of  whether  or  not   the
      relationship  with  the  Claimant's  partner  was  capable  of   being
      recognised under the Exception, within the grounds of  appeal  it  was
      argued that the Judge failed to have regard to the precise wording  of
      paragraph 339(b)(i) of  the  Immigration  Rules,  in  that  under  the
      Immigration Rules the relationship had to be formed "at  a  time  when
      the person (deportee) was in the UK  lawfully  and  their  immigration
      status was not precarious".

  51.  The wording under section 117B(4)(b) is that, "little  weight  should
      be given to a relationship formed with a qualifying  partner  that  is
      established by a person at a time  when  the  person  was  in  the  UK
      unlawfully". The wording in the statute is simply 'unlawfully'  rather
      than 'unlawfully and precarious'.

  52. Under section 117C, Exception 2  applies  where  the  Claimant  has  a
      genuine subsisting  relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a
      genuine subsistent parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
      the effect that the Claimant's deportation would have on  the  partner
      or child would be unduly harsh.

  53. I do accept the argument on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  within
      the grounds of appeal that the Judge's analysis as to the relationship
      with his partner was  flawed  by  failing  to  recognise  the  precise
      wording of paragraph 339(b)(i) of the Immigration Rules.  Although the
      wording under section 117 B (4) (b)  is  wider  than  the  wording  of
      paragraph 339(b)(i), this I find was a  deliberate  distinction  drawn
      within  the  Immigration  Rules,  that  people  who  are  subject   to
      deportation should be  subject  to  stricter  requirements.   In  this
      regard, given that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not consider  the
      precise wording of paragraph 339 (b)(1), I  do  find  that  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Kelly did err in this regard, to have taken account  of
      the fact that the relationship between the Claimant  and  his  partner
      was formed at a time when his status was precarious, when  considering
      the appeal Human Rights Grounds.

  54. Next, in regards the issue regarding did the Judge err in  considering
      the  question  of  whether  or  not  the  effect  of  the   Claimant's
      deportation on the partner or children would be "unduly harsh" for the
      purposes  of  section  117C(5).  Given  the  concession  made  by  Mrs
      Petterson on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State  that  she  was  not
      proceeding with the argument raised within the grounds of appeal  that
      the Judge erred in  failing  to  follow  the  analysis  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal in the case of KMO (Section 117 - unduly harsh) [2015] UK  UT
      00543, on the basis that First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly had  gone  on
      to consider the issue on the basis of the effect if  KMO  was  rightly
      decided and had considered the seriousness of the offence as a  factor
      in the assessment of undue harshness at [42]. Mrs  Petterson  conceded
      that the First-tier Tribunal Judge having considered  the  seriousness
      of the offence as a factor in the assessment  of  undue  harshness  at
      [42], there was no material error in  the  Judge's  analysis  in  this
      regard.

  55.  Turning to the Secretary of State's argument that the Judge failed to
      provide adequate reasons as to  why  the  deportation  would  lead  to
      "inordinately or excessively harsh" consequences and  as  to  why  the
      protected availability of the state assistance would  be  insufficient
      to meet the family's financial and medical  needs  in  the  Claimant's
      absence.  When First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly considered the question
      of undue  harshness  at  [43]  he  makes  specific  reference  to  the
      circumstances as summarised by him at [15] in particular the fact that
      one of the Claimant's children suffers from severe haemophilia B which
      means that he has a deficiency in  factor  9,  which  is  one  of  the
      essential clotting factors in blood and that consequently he is  prone
      to bleeding episodes into any part of his body, which can result  from
      traumatic injury or bleeding spontaneously.  Judge Kelly  pointed  out
      that this was a lifelong condition  that  can  cause  long-term  joint
      problems and that the child requires prophylaxis  treatment  at  least
      twice a week and sometimes daily when there is  a  bleed.   The  Judge
      accepted that  this  was  currently  administered  by  the  Claimant's
      partner, with the assistance  of  the  Claimant  and  that  the  child
      struggles while the procedure is being administered and the Claimant's
      role was to  hold  him  still  and  that  when  the  Claimant  was  in
      immigration detention for a the few  weeks  in  2014,  the  Claimant's
      partner was forced to take the child to  hospital  twice  a  week,  in
      order that a nurse could hold him still whilst the Claimant's  partner
      administered his drugs.

  56. Judge Kelly at [43] went on to find in his Judgment  the  consequences
      of the Claimant's deportation to both the partner and the two children
      would appropriately be characterised as "unduly harsh".  He found that
      the difficulties that the partner would face in struggling to  provide
      financial and medical support for the child without  assistance  would
      be obvious and that those difficulties would  be  exacerbated  by  the
      fact that she would in addition have to cope with bringing up a second
      child who at  that  stage  was  only  12  months  old.   Although  the
      Secretary of State argues that many people struggle with ill  children
      or forced to live on benefits, it was relevant in that regard that  as
      found by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  at  [16]  the  Claimant's
      partner was at that stage working 16 hours a week as a shop assistant,
      during which time the Claimant was caring for the two children  whilst
      she was at work.

  57. In my judgment, the finding of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  that
      the consequences of the Claimant's deportation  on  his  two  children
      were such that it would be unduly harsh for them to remain in  the  UK
      without the Claimant, in such circumstances where their  mother  would
      then be forced out of her job and onto benefits, and where  she  would
      then have the difficulties in caring for J., a child who suffers  with
      severe haemophilia B, as set out by Judge Kelly at [15],  in  addition
      to bringing up a second  child  who  was  only  12  months  old,  were
      findings that were open to him.  His reasoning in this regard has been
      adequately and sufficiently explained, and it cannot be said that  his
      decision in that regard is either irrational or perverse.  This was  a
      finding that was open to him on the evidence presented,  in  light  of
      the  specific  circumstances  of  the  case  and  the  severe  medical
      condition of the Claimant's son.

  58. In respect of the argument that the Judge has failed to have regard to
      the multi-faceted nature of the public interest in the deportation  of
      foreign  national  offenders  and  the  need  to  keep  other  foreign
      nationals from offending, the Judge, I find has properly borne in mind
      and weighed both the Claimant's criminality and the public interest in
      the deportation of foreign criminals, both of which he made  reference
      to within his determination and clearly had taken into account.

  59. In such circumstances, therefore,  in  light  of  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Kelly's findings, had  he  properly  considered  the  Article  8
      question through the lens of paragraph 399 of the  Immigration  Rules,
      he would in any event have found that the Claimant did have a  genuine
      and subsisting parental relationship with two children under  the  age
      of 18, who were in the UK and  who  were  British  citizens.   It  had
      already been conceded by the Secretary of State in the refusal  letter
      that it would be unduly harsh to  expect  the  Claimant's  son  J.  to
      return to  the  DRC  with  the  Claimant,  given  J's  severe  medical
      condition.  Further, Judge  Kelly  although  not  having  referred  to
      paragraph 399, also properly  considered  the  other  criteria  stated
      within that paragraph  of  the  Rules,  in  respect  of  the  parental
      relationship between the Claimant and his children and the  effect  on
      them, that found that it would be unduly harsh  for  the  children  to
      remain in United Kingdom without the Claimant, for the reasons set out
      above and detailed by the Judge at [43], with reference  to  paragraph
      [15].  It was open for him to do  so  in  the  circumstances  of  this
      particular case, for the reasons discussed above.

  60. Therefore, had First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly properly considered the
      Human Rights  Appeal  through  the  prism  of  paragraph  399  of  the
      Immigration Rules, he would have reached the same  conclusion  in  any
      event in respect of the relationship  between  the  Claimant  and  his
      children and the effect of his deportation on them.

  61. In such circumstances it was open for him to  find  that  taking  into
      account the effect on the Claimant and his children, in particular  on
      J., bearing in mind his severe health issues, that notwithstanding the
      Claimant's significant criminality,  that  the  Claimant's  own  human
      rights and those of his children would be breached by his  deportation
      and that the decision was therefore unlawful and contrary to section 6
      of the Human Rights Act 1998.  Given that the decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Kelly would therefore have been the same,  irrespective
      of the errors that he made in the way that he approached the case, the
      errors made by him do not amount to material errors.  The decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly, thereby does not contain  a  material
      error and is maintained. The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly does not contain a  material
error of  law  and  is  maintained.  The  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  is
dismissed.


Given that the case involves two children, unless and until  a  Tribunal  or
Court directs otherwise, the Claimant is granted anonymity.   No  report  of
these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member
of his family.  This direction applies both  to  the  Claimant  and  to  the
Secretary of State.  Failure to comply with this  direction  could  lead  to
contempt of court proceedings.
