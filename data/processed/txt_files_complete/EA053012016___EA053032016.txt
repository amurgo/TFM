                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The 1st Appellant,  who  was  born  on  12  April  1979,  and  the  2nd
    Appellant, who was born on 4 April 1981, are nationals of Nigeria. On 8
    January 2010 they applied  for  granted  residence  cards  as  extended
    family members of Stella Ogbemudia, who is an EEA national exercising a
    Treaty right in the United Kingdom.  On  11  February  2011  they  were
    issued with residence cards, 16 November 2015. On 9 November 2015  they
    applied for permanent rights of residence.

2.   The Respondent refused their applications on 20  April  2016  and  they
    appealed against this decision on 4 May 2016. First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Abebrese dismissed their  appeal  in  a  decision,  promulgated  on  16
    October 2017.

3.   The Appellants appealed against this  decision  and  Designated  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald granted them permission to  appeal  on  4
    January 2018.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING

4.   Both counsel for the Appellant and the Home Office  Presenting  Officer
    made oral submissions and I have  referred  to  the  content  of  these
    submissions, where relevant, in my decision below.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION

5.   Counsel for the Appellants stated that he was relying on  a  five  year
    period of residence which ran from 2008 on the basis that they met  the
    criteria of extended family members for the purposes of Regulation 8(2)
    of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  during  that
    time. This was not consistent with his later reliance on evidence which
    fell outside that period of time.

6.    Regulation  15(1)  of  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations states that:

     "The following persons shall acquire the right to reside in the  United
    Kingdom permanently

     (b) a family member of an EEA  national  who  is  not  himself  an  EEA
    national but who has residence in  the  United  Kingdom  with  the  EEA
    national in accordance with these Regulations for a  continuous  period
    of five years".

7.   In order to show that they  are  extended  family  members  of  an  EEA
    national  for  the  purposes  of  Regulation  8(2)  (c)  of   the   EEA
    Regulations, the Appellants also have to show that they are persons who
    are not family members for the purposes of regulation 7 and have joined
    their EEA national sponsor in the United Kingdom  and  continue  to  be
    dependent upon her.

8.   Case law indicates that dependency is a question of  fact.  It  is  not
    necessary  to  show  that  the  Appellants  cannot  access   employment
    themselves and are not also relying on welfare benefits. Therefore,  it
    did not matter that  it  is  clear  from  the  evidence  that  the  2nd
    Appellant  has  also  been  receiving  child  benefit  and  that   both
    Appellants have been working here in the past.

9.   In Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency)  [2013]  UKUT  00314  (IAC)  the  Upper
    Tribunal found that:

     "whether a person qualifies as a dependent under the Regulations is  to
    be determined at the date of decision on the basis of evidence produced
    to the respondent or, on appeal, the date of hearing on  the  basis  of
    evidence produced to the tribunal".

10.  It is on this basis that it is  appropriate  to  consider  evidence  up
    until the date of the hearing in front  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Abebrese despite the submissions referred to earlier.

11.  In paragraph 22 of Reyes the Upper Tribunal also found  that  "as  case
    law makes clear, in the context of EU law on family members the test of
    dependency is not whether a person is wholly or mainly  dependent,  but
    whether he or she is reliant on others for essential living needs".

12.  This has been confirmed by Lord Justice Elias in Siew Lian Lim v  Entry
    Clearance Officer, Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383, where he held that:

     "...it is not enough simply to show that financial support is  in  fact
    provided by the EU citizen to the family  member.  There  are  numerous
    references in these paragraphs which are only consistent with a  notion
    that the family member must need this support from his or her relatives
    in order to meet his or her basic needs".

13.  Counsel for the Appellants did not  submit  that  this  was  the  wrong
    test, even though this had been submitted in ground one of the  grounds
    of appeal.   Instead,  he  submitted  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Abebrese had failed to properly assess all the relevant evidence, which
    was the Appellants' second ground of appeal. In particular, counsel for
    the Appellants argued that there was no finding of fact in relation  to
    the sums of ï¿½100 paid by the sponsor into the Appellants'  accounts  in
    June, July and August 2017. However, the inference to be drawn from the
    clear wording of paragraph 32 of the decision was that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge accepted that this amount of money had been provided  to
    the Appellants by the sponsor.

14.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge also  made  it  clear  that  he  did  not
    accept that the sponsor had previously been  supplying  the  Appellants
    with similar financial support as there was nothing to  show  that  the
    large sums of money she had at times withdrawn from her Nationwide Cash-
    builder account were for the Appellants. There was  also  no  evidence,
    apart from their own testimony, that their sponsor paid their  rent  or
    any other bills. They sought to rely  on  some  receipts  for  shopping
    purchased in 2017 but, as the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  noted,
    there was nothing to suggest that the sponsor had bought  these  items.
    In addition, very few of  the  items  which  were  purchased  could  be
    characterised as essential items. This meant that the  Appellants  were
    not able to establish the necessary dependency on their sponsor between
    the time of their eviction and the payments made to them in 2017.

15.  Counsel for the Appellants also submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had made  inadequate  findings  in  relation  to  the  Appellants
    previously being part of their sponsor's household. But in paragraph 31
    of his decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge Abebrese accepted  that  the
    Appellant's evidence was credible and consistent and that  their  prior
    dependency had been established in so far as the  Appellants  had  been
    living in the same household  as  their  sponsor  up  until  they  were
    evicted from their home on or around 26 October 2012. Immigration Judge
    Cameron had also found that they were living in the same household with
    and were financially supported by their sponsor between 2008  and  2010
    in the determination promulgated on 20 October 2010.

16.  The live issue between the parties was  whether  at  the  date  of  the
    refusal to grant them permanent residence and at the date of hearing on
    29 September 2018 the Appellants continued to be dependent  upon  their
    sponsor.

17.  Furthermore, the reference to any  contributions  which  may  be  being
    made by the father of the child of one of the Appellant in paragraph 32
    of the decision was not relied upon by the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    when he reached his decision.

18.  As a consequence, I find that First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Abebrese  did
    not err in law in his decision.

DECISION

(1)  The Appellants' appeal  is  dismissed  and  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Abebrese's decision is upheld.
