                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and history of appeal

    1. This is the appeal of ZKH, a citizen of Afghanistan assessed as  born
       1 January 2001 against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  27
       September 2016 dismissing his appeal against the Home Office  refusal
       of his asylum claim of 11 March 2016.


    2. His claim was summarised in the refusal letter in these terms. He was
       a Sunni Muslim  of  Pashtun  ethnicity  who  last  lived  in  Laghman
       Province. His mother had told him that his father  was  part  of  the
       Mujahadeen before the Appellant was born. When the  Taliban  arrived,
       his father stayed at home, working in the evenings selling used cars,
       until he was abducted by the Taliban. His mother did not allow him to
       leave the house. Two months after  his  father's  disappearance,  his
       mother told him that he should leave the country.  Arrangements  were
       made for his departure from Afghanistan via a car journey  to  Kabul,
       after which he travelled via aeroplane,  foot  and  vehicles  through
       unknown countries, one of which was identified as  Hungary  following
       via fingerprint records. His mother had since died of a heart attack.



    3. Whilst accepting his  claimed  identity,  nationality  and  age,  the
       Secretary of State did not accept that his father had  been  abducted
       by the Taliban, because of discrepancies in his account;  however  he
       was granted leave until 1 July 2018 on the basis of his minority.

First-tier Tribunal decision

    4. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal,  finding
       that whilst the  discrepancies  identified  by  the  Respondent  were
       insignificant, his account was  nevertheless  not  credible,  as  his
       claim to have come from a poor background was inconsistent  with  the
       financing of his journey to the United Kingdom:  had  he  truly  been
       considered to have been at risk, he could have  simply  relocated  to
       Kabul, or sought asylum in Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece, or another
       country en route to the UK. The fact that he had withheld details  of
       having been fingerprinted in another European country counted against
       his credibility, even allowing for his  youth.  Confirmation  of  his
       father's abduction and mother's death would have been relatively easy
       to obtain from local villagers or the  treating  doctor,  bearing  in
       mind that he was legally represented, and the  arrangements  for  his
       travel to the UK seemed to be more consistent with economic migration
       than a genuine quest for asylum.

    5. As to  the  country  evidence  supporting  the  appeal,  neither  the
       instruction of, nor content of, the expert report from  Dr  Giustozzi
       had been agreed by the Respondent,  who  had  not  attended  to  give
       evidence; the report was premised on the Appellant  being  an  orphan
       whose father had been abducted, when these  were  matters  that  were
       disputed: thus his conclusions that the Taliban were violent  towards
       their opponents and that a 15-year old orphan might face problems  on
       return did not materially bear on the appeal. There was no  prejudice
       arising from the failure to trace his parents given his evidence that
       both were uncontactable, due  to  his  mother's  death  and  father's
       abduction. The letter from  the  Red  Cross  indicating  that  family
       tracing  had  been  instigated  was  of  limited   weight,   as   the
       instructions letter had not been exhibited and given the obvious lack
       of incentive for relatives to cooperate with such  efforts.  Overall,
       it was not accepted that his father had been abducted,  or  that  his
       mother had died: he could be expected to  re-establish  contact  with
       his parents on a return to Afghanistan, and he did not face a risk of
       generalised violence from the armed  conflict  sufficient  to  engage
       international protection.


    6. As to his private life outside the Immigration Rules, he had lived in
       the UK for just over a year, and liked it  here.  However  given  the
       positive finding that his parents resided  in  Afghanistan,  and  the
       expense to the taxpayer, it could not be  said  to  be  in  his  best
       interests to remain here rather than to live with his family  in  his
       country of origin. The interference with his private life  occasioned
       by his  return  there  was  not  disproportionate  given  the  public
       interest in the economic well-being of the country and the protection
       of the rights and freedoms of others.

Challenge to the First-tier Tribunal decision

    7. Grounds of appeal contended that

         a) The Dr Giustozzi report was considered only after the
            credibility findings had been made, which was to put the cart
            before the horse, and should not have been discounted for want
            of joint instruction absent the point being taken by the
            Respondent below and given the expert's reputation;


         b) It was irrational to find that the Appellant's credibility was
            undermined by a failure to contact his home village absent
            detailed reasoning explaining how that might have been
            possible;


         c) It was wrong to criticise the Appellant for not cooperating
            with family tracing when he had approached the Red Cross;


         d) It was wrong to hold the assertion that he had been
            fingerprinted in Hungary against him when that assertion by the
            Respondent was not evidenced.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  15  December
       2016 on all grounds, specifically highlighting the joint  instruction
       point and the inconsistency of approach as to family tracing.


    9. Mr Jafar developed his  arguments  in  line  with  those  grounds  of
       appeal. Mr Tarlow relied on the arguments sketched out in the concise
       Rule 24 response which argued that the decision read as a whole was a
       lawful  one,  that  the  treatment  of  the  expert  report  was  not
       materially in error given that Dr Giustozzi had wrongly  assumed  the
       Appellant's credibility was not in dispute,  and  that  the  comments
       made on family tracing were in  line  with  authorities  such  as  EU
       (Afghanistan) [2013] EWCA Civ 32.

Findings and reasons

   10. I reserved my determination at the hearing and now give  my  decision
       and reasons. The Upper Tribunal stated, giving Country Guidelines  in
       AA (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 16 (IAC) at  [92]
       that unaccompanied children would generally face "a risk  of  serious
       harm, inter alia from indiscriminate  violence,  forced  recruitment,
       sexual violence, trafficking and a lack of adequate arrangements  for
       child protection." The issue in this appeal is whether the  Appellant
       would face a real risk of persecution in his home  area  and  if  so,
       whether internal relocation would be unreasonable  because  he  would
       face persecution or unreasonable conditions in Kabul. The grounds  of
       appeal can be summarised thus: the treatment of the Giustozzi report,
       the arguable inconsistency in holding a lack  of  corroboration  from
       his home area against the Appellant whilst at the same  time  finding
       that family tracing  would  not  have  assisted  his  case,  and  the
       approach taken to a failure to claim asylum in third countries.


   11. It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in its approach
       to the Dr Giustozzi report. There are various  standard  requirements
       for expert evidence in the Practice Directions, but  prior  agreement
       with the other party is not one  of  them.  It  was  quite  wrong  to
       discount the report for that reason.

   12. The question then arises as to the materiality  of  such  error:  the
       Respondent argues that the report is only relevant to risk assessment
       and given the Appellant failed to establish the primary facts  needed
       to support his case on risk, the error had no  impact  on  its  final
       decision. I do not consider that  submission  is  made  out.  Once  a
       finding has been identified as  unlawful,  a  decision  may  only  be
       upheld where the tribunal is "tolerably confident that the tribunal's
       decision would have been the same on the basis of the  reasons  which
       have survived its scrutiny" (Neuberger LJ in HK [2006] EWCA Civ  1037
       at [45]).

   13. As a former President of the Tribunal stated in Horvath  [1999]  INLR
       7: "One cannot assess a claim without placing  that  claim  into  the
       context of the background information of the country of origin."  The
       Giustozzi report did address circumstances in  the  Appellant's  home
       province of Laghman, such as the level of violence, which  it  stated
       had risen 66% to a level of 1,029 attacks between 2014 and 2015,  the
       latter being the last date at which the Appellant  lived  there,  and
       given the minimal engagement with country evidence  in  the  decision
       below generally, it seems to me that this information might have been
       relevant in determining the  likelihood  of  the  Appellant's  father
       being abducted by the Taliban, as it demonstrates that the home  area
       is volatile rather than peaceful. It is not for the Upper Tribunal to
       second guess the weight that it might have been afforded.

   14. As to the question corroboration and family tracing, I consider  that
       the First-tier Tribunal made findings  that  were  inconsistent,  and
       accordingly  irrational,  on  the  one  hand  holding   a   lack   of
       corroboration from the Appellant's home  area  actively  against  the
       Appellant, whilst simultaneously  finding  that  there  had  been  no
       material impact caused by any tracing failure by the Respondent.

   15. Lord Toulson stated in MA and AA (Afghanistan)  [2015]  UKSC  40  �73
       stated: "If the appellant has identified people who might be able  to
       confirm his account, but the respondent has not  pursued  that  lead,
       the tribunal might  fairly  regard  the  appellant's  willingness  to
       identify possible sources of corroboration as a mark of  credibility,
       but this would be an evidential assessment for the tribunal. There is
       no presumption of credibility."

   16. So whilst it would not have been wrong for the Judge below  to  treat
       the absence of family tracing as of simply neutral  significance,  it
       was wrong to do so in a broader context  where  he  held  a  want  of
       corroboration actively against the Appellant. Of course, as the UNHCR
       Handbook states at para 196: "Often, however, an applicant may not be
       able to support his statements by documentary  or  other  proof,  and
       cases  in  which  an  applicant  can  provide  evidence  of  all  his
       statements will be the exception rather than the rule."


   17. Finally, the  First-tier  Tribunal's  treatment  of  the  Appellant's
       journey through third countries is unlawful given the context of  his
       minority. The Tribunal states "He could have sought asylum  in  Iran,
       Turkey, Greece, or in any of the countries that he travelled  on  the
       way to the United Kingdom" as conduct  inconsistent  with  a  genuine
       fear of persecution, and  holds  the  unevidenced  assertion  by  the
       Secretary of State that  the  Appellant  had  been  fingerprinted  in
       Hungary against him.

   18. The first aspect of that finding, which presumes that a young  asylum
       seeker and their family members could exercise some real choice  over
       the country of asylum claim, is made without regard to  the  evidence
       before the First-tier Tribunal recited in AA Afghanistan such as  the
       UNHCR Policy Development and Evaluation Service  study  'A  study  of
       unaccompanied Afghan children in Europe' June 2010,  entitled  'Trees
       only move in the wind" (p21), which reports:

           "Throughout the journey, the smugglers maintain tight control
           over the children through fear and intimidation, especially if
           the boys or their families are having difficulty in paying. They
           confuse the children through deliberate misinformation with
           regard to their options, so as to convince them to continue
           their journey and thereby exact the highest possible fee. ...
           this study suggests that there is a deliberate strategy among
           the smugglers to constantly split up the groups of children who
           are travelling together, keeping the level of anxiety high, and
           preventing people from building up friendships and trust that
           might threaten the authority of the smugglers and their
           assistants."

   19. The second aspect of that finding presumes  that  a  rational  asylum
       seeker would have claimed asylum in Hungary. However that is a Member
       State whose asylum procedures are  so  unsatisfactory  that  Green  J
       relied on evidence from UNHCR rehearsing the serious  failings  found
       in the status determination system there  to   conclude  in  Ibrahimi
       [2016] EWHC 2049 (Admin) that "removal of the  Claimants  to  Hungary
       gives rise to a real risk of chain refoulement to Iran".

   20. I accordingly find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law and that
       the appeal must be re-heard. As no findings from  the  hearing  below
       can be safely preserved, it is appropriate to remit  the  appeal  for
       hearing afresh before the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law.  As there are no lawful relevant findings upon which to build, the
    matter is  suitable  for  re-hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    accordingly remit the appeal to that forum.

ANONYMITY ORDER

Although the matter was not raised  before  me  or  so  far  as  I  can  see
previously, the Appellant's claim involves asylum issues and so, unless  and
until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is  granted
anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family.  This direction  applies  both  to
the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply with this  direction
could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
