Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Avery (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Youssefian (Legal Representative)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the  respondent  is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant, born March 19, 1983 is a citizen of the Ivory Coast.  He
    originally came to the United Kingdom as a  student  in  2004  and  has
    lived here lawfully ever since. He graduated in 2010  and  was  granted
    further leave to remain until May 23, 2013. In 2012 he married  and  he
    and his wife have two children born in March 2013 and August 2014.  His
    wife submitted an application for indefinite leave  to  remain  at  the
    same time that he submitted his application to remain. She was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in November 2013 but the respondent  refused
    the appellant's application on December 12, 2013. A decision to  remove
    under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006
    was also taken.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  on  December  20,
    2013. On August 27, 2014 Judge of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Eldridge
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") heard his appeal. He refused it
    under the Immigration Rules but allowed it under article 8  ECHR  in  a
    determination promulgated on September 2, 2014.

 4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on September 9, 2014 and  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Hollingsworth granted permission  to  appeal
    finding it arguable the FtTJ had possibly erred in his approach to  the
    article 8 assessment and in particular the factors he considered  under
    Section 117B of the Immigration Act 2014.

 5. Upon receipt of that permission the appellant lodged grounds of appeal,
    out of time, on October 24, 2014. Permission to appeal and an extension
    of time was granted by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Frankish  on
    November 3, 2014 on the grounds the FtTJ may have erred in  failing  to
    deal with the appellant's ground of appeal that leave to remain  should
    be allowed on the basis he satisfied Section R-LTRP of Appendix  FM  of
    the Immigration Rules.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 6. During the course of submissions Mr Avery agreed that as the  appellant
    had raised Section R-LTRP of Appendix  FM  during  the  course  of  the
    original proceedings the FtTJ should have dealt with  this  ground.  Mr
    Avery further agreed the FtTJ's approach in paragraph [16] and [17] was
    incorrect as a section 120 notice had been issued and the FtTJ  had  to
    deal with any  grounds  raised.  I  am  satisfied,  in  light  of  this
    concession, that there had been a material error of law and I  will  in
    due course deal with this issue.

    SUBMISSIONS


 7. Mr Avery addressed me on his grounds of appeal. He argued the FtTJ  had
    failed to have regard to all of the factors contained in  Section  117B
    of the 2002 Act. He had failed  to  take  into  account  the  fact  the
    appellant's wife was earning and would be able to  support  a  properly
    brought entry clearance application. The FtTJ failed  to  carry  out  a
    proper proportionality assessment which included full consideration  of
    the public interest.

 8. Mr Youssefian responded to  the  respondent's  grounds  of  appeal  and
    adopted his Rule 24 response.  The  appellant  had  clearly  stated  in
    paragraph [5] of his witness statement that he earned over �35,000  and
    his wife earned �15,000. The FtTJ was aware of this and that was why he
    concluded she would be unable  to  support  a  future  entry  clearance
    application because such an application ignored his earning ability. As
    regards section 117B of the 2002 Act he submitted that whilst there had
    been no direct reference to Section 117B(1) the FtTJ had carried out  a
    balancing act and had had regard to relevant factors in  Section  117B.
    His findings were open to him.

 9. Both parties addressed me on the appellant's own ground of  appeal  but
    as Mr Avery accepted the FtTJ should have addressed the issue I do  not
    set out the submissions save to say that following the decision  of  AS
    (Afghanistan) [2011] 1 WLR  385  the  Tribunal  was  under  a  duty  to
    consider any potential ground of appeal even if the respondent had  not
    considered it.

10. I reserved my decision on all issues.

    MY FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

11. Although the appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  were  lodged  after  the
    respondent's grounds of appeal it makes more sense  to  deal  with  his
    grounds firstly.

12. Both parties agreed that the FtTJ should have considered this ground of
    appeal. By failing to do so he erred. I have considered the materiality
    of this error with reference to the Rules.

13. Section R-LTRP of Appendix FM sets out the requirements  that  must  be
    met if an application for limited leave to remain as a  partner  is  to
    succeed.

14. The appellant satisfied R-LTRP 1.1(a), (b) and (c). A requirement of R-
    LTRP 1.1(c) is that the appellant is not caught by the requirements  of
    S-LTR of Appendix  FM.  This  appellant  does  not  fall  within  those
    exceptions. Section E-LTRP sets out the eligibility requirements and as
    the appellant's wife has indefinite leave to remain then  he  satisfies
    Section E-LTRP 1.2 (b), 1.3 to 1.8 and 1.10.  The  appellant  does  not
    fall foul of E-LTRP 2.1 or 2.2 of Appendix FM.

15. It was not disputed that they earned over �18,600 between them  and  as
    this was an in-country application  the  Rules  allow  the  appellant's
    income to be taken into account (Section E-LTRP 3.1(a)). There  was  no
    dispute about accommodation or that the appellant could  not  meet  the
    English language requirement as  required  in  Section  E-LTRP  4.1  of
    Appendix FM.

16. Accordingly, I find that the appellant should be granted limited  leave
    to remain as a partner under the Rules.

17. I turn now to the respondent's appeal. The FtTJ found the Rules did not
    cover these facts and I am satisfied  that  was  a  conclusion  he  was
    entitled to come to.

18. Whilst he did not consider Section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act he did  have
    regard to the Act as a whole as he referred to it in paragraph [27]  of
    his determination. In that paragraph he noted the appellant  positively
    met public interest requirements laid down in section 117B(2) and (3).

19. The appellant has always been here lawfully and  there  is  nothing  to
    suggest his  immigration  status  was  ever  precarious.  He  therefore
    positively satisfied Sections 117B (4) and (5) and the  fact  the  FtTJ
    did not specifically mention those subsections was not material to  his
    decision.

20. In light of his wife's newly found status their  youngest  child,  born
    August 2014, is British  and  the  tribunal  would  also  have  had  to
    consider section 117B(6) which states  the  public  interest  does  not
    require the person's removal  "where  the  person  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a qualifying child and  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom".

21. Whilst the FtTJ did not refer to Section 117B(1) this was not  material
    in light of the other findings he either made or it can be  assumed  he
    would have made based on his other findings.

22. The evidence made clear that the appellant's wife would not satisfy the
    �18,600 requirement for an entry clearance  application  and  the  FtTJ
    took this into account in making his decision.

23. The FtTJ made findings that were open to him and allowed the appeal for
    the reasons he gave.

24. There is therefore no material error in  his  allowing  the  appeal  on
    article 8 grounds.

    DECISION


25. There was a material error of law only in so  far  as  the  Immigration
    Rules are concerned.

26. The original decision is set aside to the extent  I  allow  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules for the reasons set out above. I uphold the
    article 8 decision.

27. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
