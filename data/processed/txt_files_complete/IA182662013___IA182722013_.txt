For the Appellants:    Mr L Rahman, Counsel, instructed by Ashfield ILP
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   Since the appeal was allowed at the  First-tier  the  appellant  before
    the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary of State.  For the sake of  clarity
    and convenience, however, I am referring in this determination  to  the
    parties as they were before the First-tier.

2.   The  appellants  are  a  married  couple,  and  both  are  citizens  of
    Bangladesh.  The first appellant  was  in  the  UK,  with  leave  as  a
    student, from 2006.  She was subsequently granted leave to  remain  for
    post-study work.  This period of leave ran from 31 January 2011  to  31
    January 2013.  On 15 August 2012 the second appellant was granted leave
    to enter the UK as the dependant partner of the first  appellant.   The
    first appellant then applied, in time, for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur)  Migrant,  with  the  second  appellant  listed  as  her
    dependant.

3.   The applications were refused on 8 May 2013.  The appeals were  allowed
    under the Immigration Rules by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Lobo,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 25 March 2014.

4.   The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Cruthers, on 6 May 2014.  Having heard submissions  from
    both sides I decided that the judge had erred in law in  his  treatment
    of evidence referred to at paragraph 12(a) of the  determination.   The
    evidence consisted of a newspaper advertisement for the business.  This
    had not been submitted with the application.  An earlier advertisement,
    which had been submitted with the application,  had  not  included  the
    first appellant's name and other details required by  the  Rules.   The
    later advertisement did include these details.

5.   It was agreed at the hearing, by Mr Rahman  for  the  appellants,  that
    the second newspaper advertisement was not submitted to the  respondent
    before the date of decision.

6.   Various other matters were canvassed  at  the  hearing  by  Mr  Rahman,
    including the fact that Counsel  representing  the  respondent  at  the
    hearing made a concession that the second advertisement  satisfied  the
    requirements because it was published before the decision was made.  Mr
    Rahman also referred to the fact that evidential  flexibility  was  not
    raised because of  the  position  adopted  by  the  respondent  at  the
    hearing.  On the central issue, however, he was not in  a  position  to
    make any relevant submissions.

7.   The error of law in paragraph 12(a)  is  that  the  judge  treated  the
    second advertisement as admissible evidence for meeting  a  requirement
    of the Immigration Rules that generated points.  This was  material  to
    the outcome, allowing the appeal under the Immigration  Rules,  because
    if this evidence had been treated as inadmissible the appeal could  not
    have been allowed on that basis.  In points-based appeals, for  matters
    connected to the award of  points,  evidence  will  not  be  admissible
    unless it was submitted with the application.  This flows from  section
    85A of the 2002 Act.

8.   Since it was agreed, and was clear from the evidence  presented  before
    the judge, that the second advertisement had not  been  submitted  with
    the application, and indeed had not been submitted at  all,  the  judge
    was obliged by section 85A to regard the evidence  as  inadmissible  in
    relation to the points-scoring aspect of the appeal.  His treatment  of
    the evidence as admissible amounted to a material error of law.

9.   As a consequence I set aside his decision  allowing  the  appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules.

10.  There was discussion at the hearing of how the decision in  the  appeal
    should be remade.  I indicated my view, that  having  read  the  papers
    this was an example  of  a  meritorious  application,  which  was  only
    refused because of a peripheral technical issue.  There will  be  cases
    under the points-based system, because of the structure of it  and  the
    way that the case law has developed, where  unmeritorious  applications
    succeed, because they have met all of the  detailed  requirements;  and
    there will also be cases where meritorious applications  fail,  because
    they  omitted  to  submit  some  minor  piece  of  evidence  with   the
    application.

11.  I am grateful to Mr Jarvis, who assisted with an impressively  detailed
    knowledge of the complex area of evidential flexibility.  He agreed  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State that the decisions taken were  not  in
    accordance with the law, because  the  decision  maker  had  failed  to
    consider a relevant policy.  In  view  of  this  agreement  it  is  not
    necessary for me to set out the argument in full, but  I  am  satisfied
    that the reasoning behind the agreement was sound.  The outline  is  as
    follows.  These decisions were taken on 8 May 2013.  At that time there
    was  an  earlier  and  narrower  version  of  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration Rules in force than at present,  but  also,  significantly,
    there was in force a modernised guidance document, in the version  that
    applied between 12 March 2013 and 20 May 2013.  Although  the  guidance
    was in line with  the  then  version  of  paragraph  245AA,  which  was
    significantly narrower than the version of that Rule that  was  brought
    in by HC628 in  September  2013,  the  guidance  also  had  a  document
    appended to it.  This document was the same as the second  appendix  to
    the Rodriguez decision in the Upper Tribunal,  subsequently  overturned
    by the Court of Appeal.  Within this  document  there  was  a  list  of
    categories, which included Tier 1 Entrepreneurs.   Under  that  heading
    caseworkers were advised to make enquiries if information  was  missing
    from a document.  As a result Mr Jarvis  concluded  that  there  was  a
    policy in existence at the time that would have obliged the caseworker,
    on noting that the advertisement was missing  certain  information,  to
    contact the applicants and give  them  an  opportunity  to  remedy  the
    defect.

12.  As agreed between the parties I therefore remake the decisions  in  the
    appeals by allowing them to the limited extent that they  were  not  in
    accordance with the law for failure to consider  a  relevant  published
    policy in force at the date of decision.  Despite  the  fact  that  the
    appeals do  not  fall  to  be  allowed  under  the  Immigration  Rules,
    therefore,  the  applications  remain   outstanding   awaiting   lawful
    decisions.  As a result the further evidence can be considered  by  the
    Secretary  of  State,  who  is  not  prevented  from  considering  such
    evidence, since section 85A of the 2002 Act only applies to the  appeal
    process.

13.  There was some brief discussion of the other  ground  of  refusal,  the
    contract issue.  This aspect of the judge's decision was not criticised
    in the grounds.  The focus of the argument that he  erred  in  law  was
    only in relation to the advertisement.  In any event  matters  may  now
    have moved on, in that there may be  further  contract  evidence.   The
    judge's reasoning in relation to the  contract  issue  appeared  to  be
    sound, however, and as a result the only remaining  ground  of  refusal
    related to the newspaper advertisement.

14.  It was not suggested that there was any need  for  anonymity  in  these
    appeals, and I make no such direction.  No submissions were made as  to
    fee  awards.   The  appellants  have  accepted  that  they  omitted   a
    significant piece of information  with  the  application.   That  would
    point towards no fee award being made.  On the other hand it  has  been
    accepted that the respondent failed to consider and  apply  a  relevant
    policy which, if applied, may  well  have  led  to  a  grant.   In  the
    circumstances I have decided to make a partial fee  award,  to  reflect
    this situation, of half of the fees paid.

Decision

15.  The judge made a material error of law and his  decision  allowing  the
    appeals under the Immigration Rules is set aside.

16.  The decision is remade as follows.

17.  The appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed. The appeals are allowed  to  the  limited  extent  that  the
    decisions were not in accordance with  the  law  and  the  applications
    remain outstanding, awaiting lawful decisions.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARDS

                                     Note:  this  is  not   part   of   the
    determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee  award  (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007).  I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note:  Fee
    Awards in Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


    The First-tier Judge made whole fee awards, having allowed the  appeals
    under the Immigration Rules.  In the light of my decision to remake the
    decisions in the appeals by allowing them to a limited  extent  I  have
    decided to vary those awards, for the reasons given above.   I  make  a
    partial fee award for each appeal, in the sum of  �70  (50%)  for  each
    appellant, making a total fee award of �140.
