For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr. Z. Hussain of Novells Legal Practice


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appeal

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer which  allowed  the  appeals  of  Mrs.
    Begum and her two sons against the decision to refuse  entry  clearance
    as the spouse and children of  the  Sponsor,  Mr.  Abdul  Haque,  under
    Appendix FM of the immigration rules.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the  judge  arguably
    erred in finding that the maintenance requirements  had  been  met,  in
    particular in relation to the consideration of  the  Sponsor's  income,
    paid in cash, and in having  regard  to  evidence  which  predated  the
    application by more than 28 days.

 3. For the purposes of this decision, I refer to Mrs. Begum and  her  sons
    as the Appellants and to the Entry Clearance Officer as the Respondent,
    reflecting their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.



 4. The Sponsor attended  the  hearing.   I  heard  submissions  from  both
    representatives.

Error of law

 5. Appendix FM-SE (1)(n) provides:

    "(n) The gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
    person's specified bank statements show the net amount which relates to
    the gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the relevant  specified
    evidence provided in addition  to  the  specified  bank  statements  in
    relation to non-employment income).  Otherwise,  only  the  net  amount
    shown on the specified bank statements may be counted."

 6. At paragraph [25] of the decision the judge states:

    "In his statement the Sponsor confirms that he is paid every  week  and
    deposits the money into his Barclays Bank account,

         "... however, occasionally, due to the  fact  that  I  receive  the
         wages in cash, I tend to spend money on food, drink,  pocket  money
         and remittances before depositing the money.  As a result the whole
         amount of wage after deduction of tax and NI is  not  deposited  to
         the bank account as I already spent from that amount received  from
         the employer." "

 7. In paragraph [37] he finds:

    "I find that Mr Bramall's calculations have merit.  He  states  "Taking
    the Respondent's six monthly figure of �11,400 this would equate  to  a
    monthly net salary of �1900.  According  to  UK  Tax  Calculators.Co.UK
    this would equate to a gross annual salary of �25,843.80."  Mr  Bramall
    has provided an extract from UK Tax Calculators.Co.UK. I am invited  to
    take this as a true figure of Mr Haque's gross salary for  the  purpose
    of Appendix FM-SE.  Certainly I considered this to be  the  minimum  of
    his gross salary.  As I have already indicated I do find that the  wage
    slips are a true reflection of his  real  income  but  because  of  the
    Immigration Rules and the fact that he is paid in cash there are  other
    considerations that have to be applied."

 8. In paragraph [38] he states:

    "I come to the conclusion that the Sponsor's gross annual  income  from
    cash meets the threshold when applying the Immigration  Rules  and  the
    Respondent's policy."

 9. I found that the judge was only entitled by virtue  of  Appendix  FM-SE
    (1)(n) to take into account the amount of cash paid into the  Sponsor's
    bank account.  It is clear that this is not what he has done.   It  was
    an issue of which he  was  aware,  as  shown  by  paragraph  [29].   In
    paragraph [36] he finds that the Respondent is  disregarding  the  fact
    that  the  Sponsor  has  already  paid  tax  and   national   insurance
    contributions, but this is not the point.  The fact that the Sponsor is
    paid in cash, and that he does not pay all of this cash into  his  bank
    account, means that the only income that can be  counted  is  the  "net
    amount shown on the specified bank statements".

10. I found that the judge had made a material misdirection of the  law  on
    the central issue of whether or not the Appellants  met  the  financial
    requirements of the immigration rules.  Accordingly  I  set  aside  the
    decision and proceeded to remake it.

Remaking

11. The Sponsor did not give evidence.  Accordingly  the  evidence  I  have
    taken  into  account  is  that  contained  in   the   Appellants'   and
    Respondent's bundles, the same evidence as was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Submissions

12. Mr. Hussain made  submissions  in  relation  to  Article  8  only.   He
    submitted that the first Appellant and Sponsor were committed  to  each
    other.   The  marriage  had  subsisted  through  difficult   years   of
    separation and the reason for this separation was beyond the control of
    the first Appellant and Sponsor.  They had been married for  19  or  20
    years and had "grown old together".   They  only  had  each  other  and
    depended on each other to a "marked degree".

13. If I were to find that there was no family life between  them  or  that
    the Sponsor did not depend on his family to this degree,  he  submitted
    that a new application would divide the family owing to the age of  the
    older son.  It would only be  possible  for  the  Sponsor  to  make  an
    application for his wife and youngest son to come to the United Kingdom
    and his oldest son would be left behind.  The rules were very difficult
    for a 19-year-old child who had never been independent to come  to  the
    United Kingdom and he asked how that child would be able to cope on his
    own in Bangladesh.  There were no facilities for  young  adults  to  be
    looked after by government organisations or charitable organisations in
    Bangladesh.  He submitted that the eldest  child  would  fall  on  hard
    times and would be without the guidance of his parents.  In  conclusion
    he submitted that in all fairness to the Sponsor the family  should  be
    allowed to come to United Kingdom for them to exercise their  right  to
    family life.

14. Mr. Whitwell submitted that the matter  could  not  succeed  under  the
    immigration rules.  In relation to Article 8 he submitted that the case
    had not been brought on Article 8 grounds and there  was  very  limited
    evidence before the Tribunal to show the  circumstances  in  which  the
    family found themselves in Bangladesh.  In the absence of evidence,  he
    submitted that the Sponsor considered the status quo to be adequate and
    there were no contrary indicators for me  to  take  into  account.   He
    submitted that  the  comments  regarding  the  lack  of  assistance  in
    Bangladesh for the eldest  son  should  be  ignored  as  there  was  no
    evidence.  Article 8 had to be considered as at the  date  of  decision
    and what might or might not happen in the future was not relevant.   He
    submitted that family life had been continued  in  different  countries
    and Article 8 was not engaged, let alone  interfered  with.   Should  I
    find that there was an interference, he submitted that the decision was
    proportionate as the requirements of the rules could not  be  met.   It
    was not possible for the tribunal to know what the position would be in
    the event  of  refusal,  whether  the  Sponsor's  wife  would  make  an
    application or whether she would remain in Bangladesh.

15. In response  Mr  Hussain  submitted  that  family  life  could  not  be
    exercised when they were separated by a 16 hour flight  and  six  hours
    time difference.  The time difference did not  allow  a  proper  family
    life.  That's the family had been separated for so long but were  still
    together  was  astonishing.   The  Sponsor  had  travelled   twice   to
    Bangladesh but it was very expensive.  It was not feasible for them  to
    continue family life in two different countries.

Decision

Immigration rules

16. I find that as  only  the  net  amount  shown  on  the  specified  bank
    statements can be counted in calculating the Sponsor's income  for  the
    purposes of Appendix FM-SE, the Appellants cannot meet the requirements
    of the immigration rules.  This was accepted by Mr. Hussain who did not
    address me on the immigration rules, but asked me to allow  the  appeal
    under Article 8.

Article 8

17. This had not been considered by the First-tier Tribunal as  the  appeal
    had been allowed under the immigration rules, but it had been a  ground
    of appeal before the First-tier Tribunal, and accordingly was  accepted
    as being an issue before me.

18. I have considered the Appellants' Article 8 rights in  accordance  with
    the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.   I  find  that  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor were married in 1993.  Their sons were born in 1996 and October
    2007.  On 14 February 2007, before the birth of his  younger  son,  the
    Sponsor came to the United Kingdom, and has lived here ever  since.   I
    find that since 2007 they have chosen to  conduct  their  family  lives
    with  the  Sponsor  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  Appellants  in
    Bangladesh.  Given that the Sponsor's younger son  was  born  after  he
    came to the United Kingdom, I find that they  have  never  lived  as  a
    family of four.  However, I find that there is family life between  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor for the purposes of Article 8, but  that  the
    decision does not interfere with this family life,  and  the  way  that
    they have chosen to conduct their family life for a  period  of  almost
    eight years.

19. In case I am wrong  in  this,  and  the  decision  does  constitute  an
    interference with their family lives, continuing the steps set  out  in
    Razgar, I find that the proposed interference would  be  in  accordance
    with the law, as being regular immigration decisions taken by  UKBA  in
    accordance with the immigration rules.  In  terms  of  proportionality,
    the Tribunal has to strike a fair balance between  the  rights  of  the
    individual and the interests of the community.  The public interest  in
    this case is the preservation of orderly and fair  immigration  control
    in the interests of all citizens.  Maintaining  the  integrity  of  the
    immigration rules is self-evidently a very important  public  interest.
    In practice, this will  usually  trump  the  qualified  rights  of  the
    individual, unless the level of interference is  very  significant.   I
    find that in  this  case,  the  level  of  interference  would  not  be
    significant and that it would be proportionate.

20. In assessing the public interest I have taken into account section 117B
    of the 2002 Act, so far as it is relevant.  Section 117B(1) states that
    "The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the  public
    interest."   There  is  a  significant  public  interest  in   refusing
    permission to remain to those who have failed to establish a  right  to
    enter under the immigration rules.

21. In relation to the other  relevant  factors  under  section  117B,  the
    application was  not  refused  by  reference  to  the  English-language
    requirements (section 117B(2)).  The Sponsor did not meet the financial
    requirements because of the way in which he dealt with his cash  income
    (117B(3)).  The First-tier Tribunal found that he earned  a  sufficient
    amount to meet the substantive requirements of Appendix  FM-SE.   These
    are only factors to be taken into account when considering all  of  the
    circumstances.  On their own, a positive finding cannot tip the balance
    in the Appellants' favour.

22. I find that the level of  interference  would  not  be  significant  as
    family life can continue in the way in which it has done for  the  past
    eight years.  I find that the Sponsor  chose  to  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  In his witness statement at paragraph [7] he  refers  to  the
    fact that they were separated "due to reasons beyond my control" but he
    does  not  explain  what  these  reasons  are.   In   his   Sponsorship
    undertaking he sets out his immigration history in paragraphs  [2]  and
    [3].  He says that he first came to the United Kingdom in 1996 when  he
    made an asylum claim "but did not follow this up".  He  applied  for  a
    work permit in about 2000.  He states that he was issued  with  a  work
    permit, but no leave was issued  in  his  passport.    He  returned  to
    Bangladesh, and entered in February  2007  with  a  newly  issued  work
    permit.  There is no indication in  this  history  as  to  why  reasons
    beyond his control meant that he had to apply  for  a  work  permit  in
    2007.  He has returned to Bangladesh twice,  once  in  2007,  and  once
    "about two years ago"  (paragraph  [7]  of  Judge  Colyer's  decision).
    There is no evidence before me to suggest that his decision  to  return
    to the UK in 2007 was not of his own choosing.

23. Mr. Hussain submitted that family life could not be exercised when they
    were separated by a 16 hour flight and six hours time  difference.   In
    that case, he must be accepting that there is no  family  life  between
    the Sponsor and the Appellants given that that is the way in which they
    have conducted their lives for the past eight years.  I  do  not  think
    that this is what he meant, but in any event I find that these are  the
    circumstances under which the Appellant and Sponsor chose  to  continue
    their family life.  The decision does not interfere with this, and they
    can continue in the same way that they have done since 2007.  As I have
    stated above, no reason has been given as to why the separation of  the
    Appellants and Sponsor was beyond their control.  The Sponsor  came  to
    United Kingdom in 2007 with a work permit, and  no  evidence  has  been
    provided to suggest that he came for any other than economic reasons.

24. It was submitted that the Sponsor and his wife had been married for  19
    or 20 years and had "grown old together".  Given  that  they  have  not
    been living together since 2007, and that prior  to  that  the  Sponsor
    spent time in the United Kingdom, first coming in 1996 according to his
    evidence, it is difficult to see how they have  grown  old  "together".
    There is no evidence of them depending  on  each  other  to  a  "marked
    degree".

25. In relation to the older son, no evidence was provided to  substantiate
    the claims of lack of support for him in Bangladesh, should his  mother
    decide to make a fresh application to join the  Sponsor.   No  evidence
    was provided to suggest that he would not have  assistance  from  other
    family members or that he would not be able  to  be  supported  by  the
    Sponsor.  In any event, as an adult, he would  be  leaving  the  family
    home and living an independent life.  Further, it is  for  the  Sponsor
    and his wife to decide whether to make a fresh  application  for  entry
    clearance with her youngest son, or to remain in Bangladesh.   That  is
    their choice.  The fact that no application has  been  made  until  now
    indicates that they were content previously for family life to continue
    with them being separated from one another.

26. In relation to the younger son, as I have found above, given  that  the
    Sponsor came to United Kingdom before he was born, he has never had the
    presence of his father in his life in Bangladesh, apart  from  a  visit
    about two years ago.

27. No evidence has been provided to show that family life cannot  continue
    in Bangladesh.  I find that the Sponsor can either choose to return  to
    Bangladesh to be with his family, or he can make  a  fresh  application
    for his wife and youngest son.  Alternatively, family life can continue
    through modern means of communication and visits, as it has been doing.



28. When assessing the public  interest,  there  is  a  significant  public
    interest in refusing leave to enter  to  those  who  do  not  meet  the
    requirements of the immigration rules.  Taking into account all of  the
    circumstances, I find that the Appellants have failed to  show  on  the
    balance of probabilities that the decision is a breach of their rights,
    or those of the Sponsor, to family life under Article 8 ECHR, or indeed
    any other rights protected by the Human Rights Act 1998.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point  of
law and is set aside.

I re-make the appeals, dismissing them  under  the  immigration  rules,  and
dismissing them on human rights grounds.
