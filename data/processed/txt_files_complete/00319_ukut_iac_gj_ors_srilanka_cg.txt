   (1) This determination replaces all  existing  country  guidance  on  Sri
   Lanka.

   (2) The focus of the Sri Lankan government's concern  has  changed  since
   the civil war ended in May 2009.  The LTTE in Sri Lanka itself is a spent
   force and there have been no terrorist incidents since  the  end  of  the
   civil war.

   (3) The government's present objective is to identify Tamil activists  in
   the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and to destabilise  the
   unitary Sri Lankan state enshrined in Amendment 6(1) to  the  Sri  Lankan
   Constitution in 1983,  which  prohibits  the  'violation  of  territorial
   integrity' of Sri Lanka.   Its  focus  is  on  preventing  both  (a)  the
   resurgence of the LTTE or any similar Tamil separatist  organisation  and
   (b) the revival of the civil war within Sri Lanka.

   (4) If a person is detained by the Sri  Lankan  security  services  there
   remains a real risk of  ill-treatment  or  harm  requiring  international
   protection.

   (5) Internal relocation is not an option within Sri Lanka for a person at
   real risk from the Sri  Lankan  authorities,  since  the  government  now
   controls the whole of Sri Lanka and Tamils are required to  return  to  a
   named address after passing through the airport.

   (6) There are no detention facilities at the airport.  Only  those  whose
   names appear on a "stop" list will be detained  from  the  airport.   Any
   risk for  those  in  whom  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  are  or  become
   interested exists not at the airport, but after  arrival  in  their  home
   area, where their arrival will be verified by the CID or police within  a
   few days.

    (7)      The current categories of persons at real risk  of  persecution
   or serious  harm  on  return  to  Sri  Lanka,  whether  in  detention  or
   otherwise, are:

       (a)  Individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a  threat  to  the
       integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they  are,  or  are
       perceived to have a significant role in  relation  to  post-conflict
       Tamil separatism within the diaspora and/or a renewal of hostilities
       within Sri Lanka.
       (b)       Journalists (whether in print or  other  media)  or  human
       rights activists, who, in  either  case,  have  criticised  the  Sri
       Lankan government, in particular its human rights record, or who are
       associated with publications critical of the Sri Lankan government.
       (c)  Individuals who have given evidence to the Lessons Learned  and
       Reconciliation  Commission  implicating  the  Sri  Lankan   security
       forces, armed forces or the Sri Lankan authorities  in  alleged  war
       crimes.  Among those who may have witnessed war  crimes  during  the
       conflict, particularly in the No-Fire Zones in May 2009, only  those
       who have already identified themselves by giving such evidence would
       be known to the Sri Lankan authorities and therefore only  they  are
       at real risk of  adverse  attention  or  persecution  on  return  as
       potential or actual war crimes witnesses.
       (d)  A person whose name  appears  on  a  computerised  "stop"  list
       accessible at the airport, comprising a list of those  against  whom
       there is an extant court order or arrest warrant.  Individuals whose
       name appears on a "stop" list will be stopped  at  the  airport  and
       handed over to the appropriate Sri Lankan authorities, in  pursuance
       of such order or warrant.

   (8)      The Sri Lankan authorities' approach is based  on  sophisticated
   intelligence, both as to activities within Sri Lanka and in the diaspora.
    The Sri Lankan authorities know that many Sri  Lankan  Tamils  travelled
   abroad as economic migrants  and  also  that  everyone  in  the  Northern
   Province had some level of involvement with the  LTTE  during  the  civil
   war.  In post-conflict Sri Lanka, an individual's past  history  will  be
   relevant only to the extent that  it  is  perceived  by  the  Sri  Lankan
   authorities as indicating a present risk to the unitary Sri Lankan  state
   or the Sri Lankan Government.

   (9)      The authorities maintain a computerised intelligence-led "watch"
   list. A person whose name appears on a "watch"  list  is  not  reasonably
   likely to be detained at  the  airport  but  will  be  monitored  by  the
   security services after his or her return. If that  monitoring  does  not
   indicate that such a person is a Tamil activist  working  to  destabilise
   the unitary Sri Lankan state or revive the internal armed  conflict,  the
   individual in question is  not,  in  general,  reasonably  likely  to  be
   detained by the security forces.  That will be a question of fact in each
   case, dependent on  any  diaspora  activities  carried  out  by  such  an
   individual.

   (10) Consideration must always be given to whether, in the  light  of  an
   individual's activities and responsibilities during the  civil  war,  the
   exclusion clauses are engaged (Article 1F of the Refugee  Convention  and
   Article 12(2) of the Qualification Directive).  Regard should be  had  to
   the categories for exclusion set out in the "Eligibility  Guidelines  For
   Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers  from  Sri
   Lanka", published by UNHCR on 21 December 2012.




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant appeals against a decision to refuse him  leave  to
    enter the United  Kingdom.  The  second  and  third  appellants  appeal
    against decisions of the Secretary of  State  to  remove  them  to  Sri
    Lanka. Each  appellant  appeals  on  Refugee  Convention,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights grounds.   This  determination  is  one  to
    which all three members of the panel have contributed.

 2. The changes which have taken place in Sri Lanka since the  end  of  the
    civil war in May 2009 are complex. We have had access to a  wide  range
    of oral and written  documents  and  expertise  to  assist  us  in  re-
    assessing who is at risk today if returned to Sri Lanka.  We  have  had
    the advantage of hearing from  many  highly  qualified  witnesses  with
    knowledge of circumstances in Sri Lanka now and  of  events  since  May
    2009, and of receiving over 5000  pages  of  documentary  evidence,  in
    written and electronic form.

 3. We would like to record our gratitude to counsel, to those  instructing
    them, and to the expert and country witnesses, for  the  research  they
    carried out, for full and helpful submissions, and for  their  help  in
    assembling the evidence to enable the  Tribunal  to  give  new  country
    guidance on Sri Lanka.  The present determination is necessarily a long
    one, but we have sought to maintain clarity  by  dealing  with  certain
    parts of the evidence more fully in appendices and  summarising  it  in
    the main body of the determination.

 4. In view of the length and perceived significance of this  decision,  at
    our request, all of the Counsel in  the  appeal  considered  the  final
    draft  (under  embargo)  before  it  was  published  and  made  helpful
    suggestions in relation to typing corrections and other obvious errors.
     They were also  asked  to  indicate  any  anonymity  concerns  in  the
    determination as drafted:  no such concerns were raised.

 5. The appeals  were  identified  as  suitable  for  country  guidance  in
    relation to the present situation in Sri Lanka.  The  most  recent  Sri
    Lanka country guidance is that of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal
    in  TK (Tamils, LP updated) Sri Lanka CG [2009] UKAIT  00049  based  on
    materials up to and including 26 October 2009, just five  months  after
    the civil war ended in  May  2009.  The  guidance  in  TK  updated  and
    incorporated country guidance given by the  AIT  in  LP  (LTTE  area  -
    Tamils - Colombo - risk?) Sri Lanka CG [2007] UKAIT 00076 and  approved
    by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in NA v UK,  No  25904/07
    [2011] ECHR 1272, and more recently in E.G. v.  The  United  Kingdom  -
    41178/08 [2011] ECHR 846.

 6. The civil war in Sri Lanka ended on 19 May  2009  after  more  than  25
    years of conflict, involving tens of thousands of deaths and casualties
    and serious damage to the infrastructure in the  Northern  and  Eastern
    Provinces, where the conflict was most fierce.  At the end of the civil
    war, about 160,000 Tamils were unaccounted for, but as in any  conflict
    zone, there are real difficulties in establishing how reliable any such
    statistics may be.  The LTTE within Sri Lanka is a spent force and  the
    government has full control over the whole of Sri Lanka.

 7. The evidence before us indicates that  the  Sri  Lankan  government  is
    determined to ensure that Tamil separatism and the conflict it  brought
    never recur.  The government's intention is being carried  into  effect
    by an intensive militarisation and Sinhalisation of former Tamil areas,
    "rehabilitation" of 11,000 former  LTTE  cadres,  and  intelligence-led
    monitoring and supervision of Tamil activities, both within  Sri  Lanka
    and in the diaspora.



The appellants

 8. The three appellants are Tamils, all with LTTE links.  Their names  are
    anonymised in this determination.

    1. The basis of the first appellant's account is that he  came  from  a
       family of LTTE loyalists; his sister was a member of the  Movement's
       inner  circle,  acting  as  medical  adviser  to  its  late  leader,
       Thiruvenkadam Velupillai Prabhakaran, whose death  on  18  May  2009
       ended the civil war.  The appellant was recruited in  May  2007  and
       served until the end of the civil war.  He was detained twice,  once
       as  a  civilian,  and  the  second  time,  because  of  his   family
       connections.  He has torture scars.

    2. The basis  of  the  second  appellant's  account  is  that  he  came
       originally from Jaffna but was relocated to Puthukudyiruppu where he
       worked for the LTTE on the Pallai  checkpoint  for  two  years.   He
       returned home after the ceasefire  and  was  re-recruited  in  2008,
       bunker digging and transporting the wounded.  He surrendered at  the
       end of the civil war in May 2009 and was detained for three  months,
       during which he was tortured.  He  reached  the  United  Kingdom  in
       2010.

    3. The basis on which the third appellant puts his claim is that he was
       involved with the LTTE  between  1995-1997.   He  was  detained  and
       tortured in 2001-2 but released from detention  in  2002  after  the
       ceasefire, and came to the United Kingdom in 2005.  His  brother  is
       also in the United Kingdom and has been granted asylum on appeal.

Tamil Celebrations

11. The evidence indicates that  the  following  celebrations,  held  every
    year, are specific to the Tamil community and that many Tamils may wish
    to participate in celebrating them, both within Sri Lanka  and  in  the
    diaspora:

|Tamil name[2] |Translation   |When celebrated                          |

Evidence before the Upper Tribunal

12. The hearing of these appeals  took  place  over  nine  days  between  5
    February and 19 April 2013 (excluding Case Management  Review  hearings
    which guided the preparation of the case between September 2012 and the
    full hearings).  TAG sought and  was  granted  leave  to  intervene  on
    behalf of issues concerning the Tamil  diaspora  in  general.   We  are
    indebted to TAG for making available additional experts,  evidence  and
    argument which would not otherwise have been before us.

13. All parties, including TAG, made extensive written submissions  before,
    during and after the main hearing, as well as oral submissions  at  the
    end of the case.

14. We received approximately 5000 pages of documentary evidence.   We  had
    the  benefit  of  oral  evidence  from  seventeen  expert  and  country
    witnesses, including three witnesses for the respondent  with  detailed
    knowledge regarding the preparation of Operational Guidance  Notes  and
    Country of Origin Reports, and  of  entry  procedures  at  Bandaranaike
    Airport, Colombo.  Four more experts gave evidence by witness statement
    or report but were not available for cross-examination.

15. We also heard from two of the appellants to clarify matters  which  had
    arisen after their  original  evidence  was  given  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The evidence is dealt with when  we  consider  each  of  the
    appellant's particular circumstances at the end of this  determination.
    The third appellant was not called:  medical evidence indicated that he
    might not be fit to testify and his representatives elected not to risk
    any further harm to his mental state.

16. The witness evidence and other relevant information are set  out  in  a
    series of appendices to this determination.   For  ease  of  reference,
    those appendices and the material they contain are as follows:

17. We have had regard to all of the material before us, written and  oral.
    We mean no disrespect to the parties, all of whom put in a  great  deal
    of work to assist the  Upper  Tribunal  in  understanding  the  present
    situation in Sri Lanka, when we say that we do not intend to set it out
    in extenso in this determination.

Procedural issues

18. There were a number of procedural issues during the  hearing,  most  of
    which concerned the admissibility or disclosure of certain evidence.  A
    good deal of evidence was served late, including  during  the  hearing.
    In most cases, the late service did not cause  any  lasting  difficulty
    and requires no comment now.  There are three procedural  issues  which
    do require analysis in this determination.

Unrelated Tribunal determinations

19. The parties, and in particular TAG, had obtained copies of 52  positive
    asylum  determinations (mostly First-tier Tribunal determinations,  but
    including some unreported Upper Tribunal decisions  and  four  positive
    decisions by the respondent at first instance) in which the accounts of
    Sri Lankan  appellants  had  been  found  credible  and  their  appeals
    allowed.  The appellants in those cases all stated that they  had  been
    tortured after returning to Sri Lanka.  In  16  of  the  determinations
    relied  upon,  the  respondent  was  not  represented,  such  that  the
    appellant's account was untested  by  cross-examination.   All  of  the
    determinations  were   unchallenged   by   any   onward   appeal.   The
    determinations were unreported and the appellants  concerned  were  not
    contacted to seek consent for the use of their personal information.

20. We received oral and written submissions from  all  parties  (including
    TAG) on the admissibility of these determinations and the weight  which
    we should give to them, if admitted.

21. For the respondent, Mr  Hall  argued,  first,  that  it  is  a  general
    principle of civil litigation that previous findings of fact do not set
    precedents for later cases between different parties (see paragraph  64
    of AA(Somalia) and  AH  (Iran)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  1040),  and  second,  that  the  general
    principle is maintained in immigration appeals save (a)  on  the  basis
    identified in the IAT's starred decision  in  Devaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT
    000702*, where there is a familial link between the appellants in  each
    determination, or (b) in narrow circumstances set out in  the  judgment
    of Lord Justice Carnwath (as he then was) in AA (Somalia) at paragraphs
    69-70 thereof:

           "69.  ... exceptions to  the  ordinary  principle  that  factual
           decisions do not set precedents (see above)  should  be  closely
           defined. To extend the principle to cases where there is no more
           than an "overlap of evidence"  would  be  too  wide,  and  could
           introduce undesirable uncertainty. In all the cases in which the
           principle has been applied so far, including Ocampo, the  claims
           have not merely involved overlapping evidence, but  have  arisen
           out of the same factual matrix, such as the same relationship or
           the same event or series of events. I  would  respectfully  read
           Auld LJ's reference to "cases such as the present"  as  limiting
           the principle to such cases.

           70.   Secondly, in applying the guidelines  to  cases  involving
           different claimants, there may be a valid distinction  depending
           on whether the previous decision was in favour of or against the
           Secretary of State. The difference  is  that  the  Secretary  of
           State was a direct party to  the  first  decision,  whereas  the
           claimant was not. It is one thing to restrict a party  from  re-
           litigating the same  issue,  but  another  to  impose  the  same
           restriction on someone who, although involved  in  the  previous
           case, perhaps as a witness, was not formally a  party.  This  is
           particularly relevant to the Tribunal's comments, in Devaseelan,
           on  what  might  be  "good  reasons"  for  reopening  the  first
           decision. It  suggested  that  such  cases  would  be  rare.  It
           referred, for example, to the  "increasing  tendency"  to  blame
           representatives  for  unfavourable  decisions  by  Adjudicators,
           commenting:

                 "An Adjudicator should be very slow  to  conclude  that  an
                 appeal  before  another  Adjudicator  has  been  materially
                 affected by a representative's error or incompetence..."

           I understand the force of those comments where the second appeal
           is by the same claimant, but less so where it is by a  different
           party, even if closely connected. Although I would  not  exclude
           the Devaseelan  principles  in  such  cases  (for  example,  the
           hypothetical series of cases involving the same family, cited in
           TK), the second Tribunal may  be  more  readily  persuaded  that
           there is "good reason" to revisit the earlier decision."

22. Mr Hall's third point was that the judges in these determinations  were
    not making factual findings for wider use; the fourth point was that it
    was  impermissible  to  aggregate  individual  findings  in  order   to
    demonstrate a general factual probability.  His  final  point  is  that
    these determinations were made based on country guidance which is to be
    reconsidered in the present determination and  which  we  may  need  to
    modify.

23. The appellants' arguments in their closing submissions on admissibility
    are based on CM (EM country guidance; disclosure)  Zimbabwe  CG  [2013]
    UKUT 59 (IAC) which sets out the flexibility  available  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal in receiving relevant information, and  TK  (Consideration  of
    Prior Determination - Directions) Georgia [2004] UKIAT 00149, which was
    taken into account by Carnwath LJ in reaching  his  conclusions  in  AA
    (Somalia) and therefore is not in  conflict  with  the  guidance  there
    given.

24. We were referred to the Senior President's  Practice  Direction  of  15
    February 2010, given by Lord Justice  Carnwath  (as  he  then  was)  as
    Senior President of Tribunals.  The relevant guidance is  at  paragraph
    11:

       "11 Citation of unreported determinations

       11.1 A determination of the Tribunal which has not been reported may
       not be cited in proceedings before the Tribunal unless:-

          (a) the person who is or was the appellant before the  First-tier
          Tribunal, or a member of that person's family, was a party to the
          proceedings in which the previous determination was issued; or
          (b) the Tribunal gives permission. ...

       11.3 Permission under paragraph 11.1 will be given  only  where  the
       Tribunal considers that it would be materially assisted by  citation
       of the determination, as distinct from the adoption in  argument  of
       the reasoning to be found in the determination. Such  instances  are
       likely to be rare; in particular,  in  the  case  of  determinations
       which were unreportable (see Practice  Statement  11  (reporting  of
       determinations)). It should be emphasised that the Tribunal will not
       exclude good arguments from consideration but it will  be  rare  for
       such an argument to be capable of being made only by reference to an
       unreported determination. ..."

25. It is not suggested that the determinations now sought  to  be  adduced
    fall within 11.1(a).  The question is the exercise  of  our  discretion
    under paragraph 11.1(b) to admit these determinations, which we  do  by
    reference to the guidance in AA (Somalia), which is  binding  upon  us.
    We are conscious  that  these  are  asylum  appeals  and  that  anxious
    scrutiny of all relevant material is required.  Anxious scrutiny is the
    more relevant in country guidance analysis to ensure that  we  have  as
    broad a picture as possible of the  current  situation  in  Sri  Lanka.
    However, we find nothing in the appellants' arguments which inclines or
    entitles us to depart from the guidance of the Court of  Appeal  in  AA
    (Somalia).  We  are  not  persuaded  that  these  documents  should  be
    admitted; they do not come within the range of  documents  contemplated
    as likely to be admitted in that judgment.

26. Even if we were to admit these determinations, the weight we could give
    to  them  is  constrained  by  a  number  of  factors.   First,   these
    determinations are relied upon for their factual findings  rather  than
    their legal analysis, which would be based on the country  guidance  at
    the time, which we review in the present determination, in the light of
    the evidence now before us as to the  post-conflict  situation  in  Sri
    Lanka.  Second, just under a  third  of  these  determinations  reflect
    hearings where the Secretary of State was not represented and in  which
    the appellant's evidence was untested by cross-examination; and in many
    cases, as Ms Jegarajah told us, the factual matrices  relied  upon  are
    insufficiently developed because of the course which the arguments took
    before an individual judge.

27. At the end of the hearing, we were presented with  a  tabular  analysis
    prepared by Mr Hays on behalf of the respondent and annotated on behalf
    of the third appellant by Ms Pickup, setting out the facts relied  upon
    in the unreported determinations. In his submissions, Mr Hall  accepted
    the accuracy of the  information  added  by  Ms  Pickup's  annotations.
    Given that the contents of the tabular analysis are not in dispute,  we
    have had regard to the information there summarised[4].

28. The weight that we give to this evidence is shaped  by  our  conclusion
    that the underlying determinations are not  admissible.  At  best  this
    data is reliable as evidence that a number of  appeals  by  Sri  Lankan
    nationals have been allowed in the light  of country guidance which  we
    are reconsidering.

29. The fact of the appeals having been allowed indicates that certain past
    ill-treatment by the Sri Lankan authorities was  accepted  by  Tribunal
    judges in individual cases. The  data  is  part  of  a  wide range  of
    evidence that we have heard and read; this assists us in examining the
    situation today.  However,  had  there  been  any  dispute  as  to  the
    contents of the tabular analysis, we would have  excluded  it  for  the
    same reasons as we have excluded the  determinations  from  which  that
    material was drawn.

The respondent's duty of disclosure

30. On 31 January 2013, just before  these  hearings,  the  Upper  Tribunal
    promulgated a guidance decision on the respondent's duty of  disclosure
    in CM (EM country guidance; disclosure)  Zimbabwe  CG  [2013]  UKUT  59
    (IAC), which set out  the  respondent's  duty  to  furnish  information
    within her  possession  or  control  in  proceedings  before  us.   The
    material paragraph of the judicial headnote is paragraph (1):
           (1) There is no general duty of disclosure on the  Secretary  of
           State in asylum appeals generally or Country Guidance  cases  in
           particular. The extent of the Secretary of State's obligation is
           set out in R v SSHD ex p Kerrouche No 1 [1997] Imm  AR  610,  as
           explained in R (ota  Cindo)  v  IAT  [2002]  EWHC  246  (Admin);
           namely, that she must not knowingly mislead a court or  Tribunal
           by omission of material that was known or  ought  to  have  been
           known to her.

31. Two disclosure issues arose thereunder.

    i. We were made aware, during the evidence of the  UKBA  witnesses,  of
       the existence of  a  Bilateral  Readmission  Agreement  between  the
       United Kingdom and Sri Lanka.  The respondent refused to disclose  a
       copy of that agreement, but we consider that we are able  to  deduce
       its relevant contents sufficiently from the procedures adopted.   No
       disclosure order was made for this document.

   ii. The appellants sought disclosure of information in the possession or
       control of the respondent regarding their contention that there  was
       a significant trend in 2011-2012 of  students  with  multiple  entry
       visas, returning to Sri Lanka and coming to  harm  there,  and  then
       seeking  asylum  in  the  United  Kingdom  (the  "recent  returnees"
       profile).  They had been endeavouring to obtain information from the
       respondent  about  cases  in  her  database  fitting   the   "recent
       returnees" profile.

32. In the light of the CM guidance, the respondent accepted that she had a
    duty to make enquiries to enable her to assist  the  Tribunal,  stating
    that the information was not retained  on  her  database  in  the  form
    sought.  It was not possible for  her  to  comply  with  a  request  to
    analyse the record of all individuals on multiple entry visas  who  had
    returned and made asylum applications, since no  adequate  computerised
    records  of  departures  and  returns  on  multiple  entry   visas   is
    maintained.

33. The original requests were impermissibly wide but they were refined  at
    the hearing, after discussions between the parties  and  the  Tribunal.
    The agreed version of the disclosure order, made with reference  to  an
    earlier Note on Disclosure by the respondent, was as follows:

           "2. In respect of the enquiries  undertaken  by  the  Respondent
           pursuant to paragraph  23  of  her  note  on  Disclosure  of  10
           December 2012, the Respondent shall ... provide  in  writing  to
           the Tribunal and the parties:

                 a.    The wording of all  questions  asked  of  the  Asylum
                 Regional Offices;
                 b.    What, if any, information was given  in  response  by
                 each office to each question.

           3.    The Respondent shall...provide  to  the  parties  and  the
           Upper Tribunal the number  of  Sri  Lankan  nationals  who  were
           granted refugee status in  the  period  1  October  2012  to  31
           December 2012 who had previously  been  removed,  including  the
           number of cases in which there  was  an  allegation  of  torture
           following return to Sri Lanka.

           4.    The Respondent shall confirm ... whether she accepts  that
           there is a pattern of  persons  with  lawful  residence  in  the
           United Kingdom returning to Sri Lanka  and  being  detained  and
           tortured in Sri Lanka after return, and thereafter being granted
           asylum (whether in response to an initial claim or following  an
           appeal)."

34. The respondent made enquiries  of  her  ten  regional  asylum  casework
    centres and also provided some statistical  information.   Six  regions
    made partial  replies,  albeit  statistically  inadequate  and  largely
    anecdotal.  The remaining caseworker regions provided no information at
    all.  The outcome of the respondent's enquiries  was  provided  to  the
    Tribunal in a statement from Mrs Athi-Parkin,  which  stated  that  the
    respondent was aware that in a small number of cases, but  not  on  the
    scale which the appellants and TAG contended,  applicants  fitting  the
    "recent returnees" profile had been granted asylum.

HRW/FFT/TAG reports - confidentiality

35. During 2012, HRW, FFT and TAG all produced major  reports  and  several
    press releases asserting that varying numbers of individuals  had  been
    ill-treated on return to  Sri  Lanka  and  asking  the  United  Kingdom
    government to desist from forced returns.  The majority  of  the  press
    releases were timed for a day or two before known charter flights.   It
    was not clear initially how many of the individuals in each report were
    the same, nor whether the respondent was aware of their circumstances.

36. The appellants and TAG by their Counsel and  their  witnesses  insisted
    throughout the hearing on absolute confidentiality in relation  to  any
    personal information about the individuals concerned. We were not given
    access to the medical evidence underlying the HRW and FFT  reports  and
    the facts provided were heavily redacted.

37. The respondent had  been  asking,  during  2012,  for  details  of  the
    individuals whose experiences were relied upon, to enable  them  to  be
    verified on her own databases. TAG supplied the determinations  it  had
    found, most of which were available in September  2012.   HRW  and  FFT
    declined to disclose to the respondent any identifying details  of  the
    individuals  whose  circumstances  were  summarised  in  their  various
    reports.  It was therefore impossible for the respondent  to  make  any
    assessment of the validity of the allegations in the HRW and FFT  press
    releases and reports issued during 2012.

38. Even now, it has not been possible to establish with certainty  whether
    there is an overlap between the cases of which the respondent is aware,
    and those relied upon by the  appellants.   In  each  group,  on  close
    analysis, the examples relevant to the "recent returnees"  profile  are
    very  few,  and  the  evidence  provided  is  anecdotal   rather   than
    statistically significant.  This  is  partly  because  the  information
    provided by the respondent was not precise  or  consistent  across  her
    regional casework groups, and partly because  the  appellants  and  the
    NGOs did not wish to share names or other identifying details with  the
    respondent for that purpose. The parties assisted us by  comparing  the
    underlying names and details with each other and attempting to  resolve
    the question of how many of their clients overlapped.

39. We have before us such factual details as the respondent  was  able  to
    produce, together with tabular analysis of the examples relied upon  by
    the appellants.  We have considered what weight we can place  on  these
    examples.  It is plain that  there  are  a  small  number  of  returned
    Tamils, mainly students, who were granted asylum on application  or  on
    appeal, and who fit  the  "recent  returnees"  profile.   None  of  the
    parties (including  TAG)  relies  on  cases  where  harm  or  detention
    occurred on return to individuals in other  categories  where  multiple
    entry visas are given.

Ms Hogg and her HRW research

40. There was a particular difficulty with the oral evidence  of  Ms  Charu
    Lata Hogg, a researcher at Chatham House, and former employee  of  HRW.
    Her evidence was based on research which she had carried out  for  HRW,
    in relation to which she was under a  strong  duty  of  confidentiality
    which prevented her giving any evidence other than that  which  was  in
    her statement, or disclosing the name of her client, which  placed  her
    in a very difficult position during the first day of her oral  evidence
    on 8 February 2013.

41. The report based on Ms Hogg's research was in an advanced  draft  by  8
    February 2013, but its publication had been set for  28  February  2013
    (known to TAG and HRW to be the date of the next charter flight removal
    to Sri  Lanka).  The  Tribunal  asked  for,  and  eventually  received,
    evidence from HRW as to the circumstances in which  that  close  timing
    had occurred.  We will deal with the response by Mr Brad Adams  of  HRW
    (received in  the  form  of  two  witness  statements)  later  in  this
    determination.

42. We adjourned Ms Hogg's evidence to the first available date  after  the
    report was published.  Ms  Hogg  was  recalled  to  give  further  oral
    evidence on 15  March  2013,  at  which  time  she  was  released  from
    confidentiality at least in relation to the contents of that report and
    the body which commissioned it.  She considered that she remained bound
    not to disclose the names or any personal details of those whose  cases
    were considered in her research.

Updating the country guidance

Existing guidance

43. The core of the existing country guidance dates back to the decision in
    LP in 2007, which identified twelve "risk factors"'  which,  singly  or
    together, indicated an enhanced risk of persecution or serious harm for
    those returning to Sri Lanka  at  the  height  of  the  internal  armed
    conflict between the LTTE and the GOSL.  A  number  of  factors  (which
    became known as the LP/TK factors) were identified as being  likely  to
    raise  official  interest  in  returnees  from  the   United   Kingdom,
    particularly those on charter flights.  The evidence underlying the  LP
    decision was up to date as at April 2007 and focused principally on the
    risk of being  identified  and  detained  at  Bandaranaike  Airport  in
    Colombo, or in Colombo itself.  The AIT considered that the majority of
    returning failed asylum seekers were processed  relatively  quickly  at
    the airport and with no difficulty beyond some possible harassment.

44. The AIT in LP emphasised that in each case the  analysis  of  risk  was
    fact-specific:  in order for an individual to establish a real risk  or
    reasonable degree of likelihood of persecution or serious harm if he or
    she were returned to Sri Lanka, the "risk factors"', and the weight  to
    be ascribed to them, individually and cumulatively, must be  considered
    in the light of the credible  facts  established  by  such  individual,
    having  regard  to  the  lower  standard  applicable  in  international
    protection claims.

45. In TK, decided soon after the end of the civil war in  Sri  Lanka,  the
    AIT upheld the approach in LP but considered  that,  if  anything,  the
    situation for returning failed Tamil asylum seekers had  improved.  The
    evidence in TK was current as at 26 October 2009 and is  therefore  now
    almost three and a half years old.  The civil war has  ended  and  that
    has of course brought change, not just in the circumstances within  Sri
    Lanka but also in the present concerns of the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
    which may entail adverse interest in  returning  Sri  Lankan  citizens,
    including risks requiring protection under the  Refugee  Convention  or
    Refugee Qualification Directive.

46. In a Policy Bulletin in October 2012[5], reissued in  March  2013,  the
    UKBA Country Specific Litigation Team,  Operational  Policy  and  Rules
    Unit set out the history of the TAG, HRW  and  FFT  reports  and  press
    releases issued during 2012.  The bulletin, even when reissued, did not
    engage with new UNHCR Guidelines issued in December 2012.

47. On 21 December 2012, the UNHCR published  new  "Eligibility  Guidelines
    for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from
    Sri Lanka", the first such guidelines since July 2010.  The  change  in
    UNHCR's assessment contributes to our view that now is the time for the
    Upper Tribunal to revise its guidance on Sri Lanka.

48. We considered that it was appropriate, in the light  of  the  perceived
    changes and new UNHCR guidance, for the Upper Tribunal to reassess  its
    own guidance on Sri Lanka.  We wanted to consider whether the situation
    remained as it had been in TK, that is to say,  that  the  country  was
    settling down into a peaceful recovery from a  long  and  brutal  civil
    war, or whether the situation in Sri Lanka was indeed deteriorating  as
    suggested and new guidance was needed.  For the reasons we set  out  in
    this determination, we have concluded that the  guidance  needs  to  be
    replaced on the basis of the situation now.

Agreed issues

49. With the assistance of the parties, an exhaustive list  was  agreed  of
    the issues relevant to the new country guidance and to  these  appeals.
    The agreed list is at Appendix B.  Only questions 2-9  are  of  general
    interest and inform our guidance.  Questions under heading 1 deal  with
    the task of a country guidance determination and need  no  elaboration.
    The issues set out at paragraphs 10A, 10B and 10C are specific to  each
    individual appellant.

50. The areas of general interest which the Tribunal and the parties agreed
    to consider  concerned  the  circumstances  of  exit  from  Sri  Lanka,
    forcible return to Sri Lanka,  entry and  exit  procedures  at  Colombo
    airport, with  particular  reference  to  charter  flights,  living  in
    Colombo (whether that is an appellant's home area, or  as  an  internal
    relocation option); issues relating to residence and/or LTTE  or  anti-
    government activity in United  Kingdom;  the  position  of  war  crimes
    witnesses; the rehabilitation process for former LTTE  cadres  and  its
    use today; and a small number of other factors which may be relevant to
    the assessment of risk.

51. We have not considered whether asylum claims are being asserted in  the
    United Kingdom based on self-inflicted scarring, or scarring  inflicted
    at an appellant's  request,  in  the  United  Kingdom,  Sri  Lanka,  or
    elsewhere.  The Upper Tribunal has identified another appeal where that
    issue may be relevant.  No such allegation is made in respect of any of
    the present appellants.

Summary of Evidence

52. The oral and written evidence which we received is set out fully in the
    Appendices to this determination.  There was strikingly broad agreement
    between the witnesses as to the militarisation of the Northern Province
    and as to the concerns of the government about possible  resurgence  in
    the diaspora of Tamil separatism and/or of the LTTE or a similar  Tamil
    separatist organisation.  We shall refer to  relevant  aspects  of  the
    evidence when discussing the individual  issues.  The  following  is  a
    concise summary of the other points which we  draw  from  the  evidence
    before us:

Appendix C - the UKBA witnesses

53. The evidence from the UKBA witnesses was as follows.  Mr Malcolm  Lewis
    gave a clear picture of the operation of the  BHC's  Migration  Support
    team (the MDO and MSO) at the airport.  The MSO and (where there is one
    in place) the MDO  meet  all  charter  flights.   Arrangements  at  the
    airport have been improved.  No arriving passengers  are  subjected  to
    ill-treatment at the airport, the authorities being very well aware  of
    the allegations levelled against them  in  the  past.   Returnees  were
    interviewed by the DIE and SIS at the  airport,  their  onward  details
    taken, and permitted to proceed,  unless  there  was  a  "stop"  notice
    indicating a court order or arrest warrant against them.

54. They were given details of how to contact the BHC  after  their  onward
    journey and sometimes did so, often seeking advice on how to return  to
    the United Kingdom, but sometimes making allegations of  ill-treatment.
    The only one he had been able to investigate proved to be significantly
    overstated: the appellant said he had been  ill-treated  and  that  his
    head was  bleeding,  but  doctors  in  Jaffna  refused  to  assess  his
    injuries.  He returned to Colombo for medical assessment and it  turned
    out that his shins had been kicked at the airport.

55.  Returnees  were  asked  at  the  airport  about  addresses  they  were
    associated with before leaving the country, their last address  in  the
    United Kingdom, and their onward address in Sri Lanka.  They  might  be
    asked for details of schools, former employers, and travel history,  or
    their reasons for returning to the United Kingdom.  They might be asked
    to sign a declaration that the details were  true.  He  could  not  say
    whether the returnees were asked about their LTTE links as he  was  not
    allowed to be in the room during questioning.

56. Where individuals returned other than on a charter flight,  they  could
    walk through the airport on their own passport.  They were unlikely  to
    be of interest even if travelling on a  TTD,  unless  they  were  on  a
    "stop" list.  Those on a "watch" list would be monitored later  by  the
    security services but not stopped.  Sometimes an airline  might  notify
    DIE about a particular returnee and if so, that  returnee  was  usually
    (but not always) handed to DIE at the airport.

57. Onward addresses were checked by the police or  the  CID  within  seven
    days from arrival.  Details of offences in the United Kingdom were  not
    passed to the Sri Lankan authorities by the British  authorities.  Most
    people were on their way quickly at the airport though some waited  two
    to four hours.

58. Mr Lewis was aware of allegations that passports were  not  scanned  on
    exit if a suitable bribe was paid:  however, exit was through  an  open
    area with 15-20 desks all visible to the Chief Immigration Officer  who
    sat behind.  He did not think it was possible to switch off a  terminal
    without being discovered.

59. Mr Gallagher dealt with the preparation of Country of  Origin  Reports.
    He also represented the country of origin service in its meetings  with
    the Independent Advisory  Group  on  Country  Information  (IAGCI),  an
    external assessor.  He explained  the  process  of  production  of  the
    country of origin documents, which he supervised.   He  confirmed  that
    some of the criticisms made by Dr David Rampton in his report for IAGCI
    on the March 2012 Country of Origin Report had  been  accepted  by  the
    respondent, but none had yet been incorporated into  the  her  reports,
    guidance notes or bulletins.

60. Mr Wright is a member of the respondent's Country  Specific  Litigation
    Team (CSLT) which prepares the Operational Guidance Notes (OGNs).   The
    OGNs are supervised by the IAGCI and reflect all  relevant  information
    and case law.  CSLT works with external sources (in  particular,  Still
    Human Still Here and the FFT submissions to UNCAT).  When the  December
    2012 OGN was drafted, CSLT consulted case owners  to  see  whether  the
    existing main categories remained current.  The response  was  that  no
    new  trends  in  asylum  applications   were   highlighted,   including
    'individuals who had previously had valid leave to  be  in  the  United
    Kingdom'.

61. CSLT also issues ad hoc Country Policy Bulletins on particular  issues.
    He was responsible for the Bulletin first published on 15 October  2012
    and republished a week later, changes having been made in  response  to
    comments from TAG.  The rest of Mr Wright's evidence  concerns  matters
    of detail in relation to the HRW cases and is dealt with later in  this
    determination.

62. Mrs Athi-Parkin provided a statement on 13 February 2013 in response to
    a directions order from  the  Tribunal,  requiring  the  respondent  to
    disclose her knowledge of any upward trends in asylum claims  based  on
    detention or torture  after  return  to  Sri  Lanka,  'even  where  the
    individual had  not  previously  sought  asylum  but  had  simply  been
    visiting or studying here'.  The statement is set out in  full  in  the
    Appendix and analysed later in this determination.

63. After setting out the information produced, Mrs Athi-Parkin said that:

           "...the respondent accepts that there is a  pattern  of  persons
           with lawful residence in the United Kingdom who  claim  to  have
           returned to Sri Lanka, and to have been  detained  and  tortured
           there, and who have then returned  to  the  United  Kingdom  and
           sought asylum.   The  respondent  accepts  that  some  of  these
           individuals have been granted asylum by the Secretary  of  State
           or on appeal to the Tribunal."

Appendix D - Dr David Rampton

64. Dr Rampton commented for IAGCI on the  March  2012  Country  of  Origin
    Report on Sri Lanka.  His evidence covers that consultancy  report,  in
    which he criticised the respondent for failure  to  deal  with  certain
    specific cases and also for a lack of breadth  in  the  sources  relied
    upon.

65. His report deals principally with his own  knowledge  and  opinions  in
    relation to the issues before us.  He noted that:

        "12. ...President Rajapaksa himself ... on  multiple  occasions  in
        speeches and interviews has blamed the Tamil Diaspora  for  driving
        the conflict and for making  impossible  demands  that  prohibit  a
        peaceful settlement. For  this  reason  the  GoSL  has  engaged  in
        surveillance  of  the  Tamil  Diaspora  in  European  and   Western
        societies  as  an  attempt  to  prevent  and/or  contain  the  (re-
        )emergence of  the  LTTE  or  another  militant  Tamil  nationalist
        movement.  It is worth noting that the LTTE did operate as a global
        network  with  offices,  funding  networks,  arms  procurement  and
        commercial shipping arms located amongst and directed from pro-LTTE
        sections of the Tamil Diaspora.

        13. As a result, the GOSL's attitude towards failed asylum  seekers
        is that they represent a  potential  security  threat  to  the  Sri
        Lankan state and society and that any potential suspect aligned  to
        Tamil nationalism must therefore be subject to close  scrutiny  and
        investigation by the security and intelligence forces. ...

        18. ...Where individuals have revealed information that illuminates
        aspects of the civil war  crimes  issue  (including  the  scale  of
        civilian casualties), the GOSL has used  coercive  pressure  and/or
        threat  to  force   individuals   to   retract   statements.   Many
        international observers believe that this was  the  case  with  the
        five Tamil Doctors who had provided medical services in  the  Vanni
        during the last phase of the civil war, who after making statements
        about the extent of civilian  casualties  were  then  detained  and
        accused of giving false information to the media by the GoSL. Their
        original claims and predicament was then  backed  up  by  Wikileaks
        cables between the US Embassy and Washington.

        The GOSL has also suffered increasing opprobrium  and  pressure  in
        the wake  of  war  crimes  allegations  amongst  the  international
        community including a successful US-backed  resolution  adopted  at
        the UN Human Rights Council in March 2012.  All  of  these  factors
        indicate that however hardnosed the GoSL may appear at  times  over
        the civil war crimes issue, it is and always has been concerned  to
        keep as tight a lid as possible on the release of information about
        the issue. ..."

66. Dr Rampton was particularly concerned  about  the  threat  to  judicial
    independence within Sri Lanka:

        20. ...although many of the problems with both  media  freedom  and
        the judiciary are long- standing,  it  should  be  noted  that  the
        spread of authoritarianism has centralized more power in the  hands
        of the President, his family, his patronage machine and removed the
        weak existing checks that might  prevent  abuses  operative  within
        state apparatuses. The recent  impeachment  of  the  Chief  Justice
        Shirani Bandaranayake is yet another example of the ability of  the
        President to ride roughshod over constitutional  procedure  out  of
        political fiat. These tendencies do have an impact upon  the  media
        and its ability to operate freely and  upon  the  criminal  justice
        system, both of which in turn will affect the willingness of people
        to speak out where they have suffered abuse, torture and  degrading
        treatment by the authorities and security forces.

        21.  Firstly it should be noted that any complaint about torture or
        other mistreatment exists  within  a  generalized  situation  where
        access to due judicial process,  rule  of  law  and  protection  is
        problematic  because  the  judicial  system   lacks   independence,
        transparency, accountability and safeguards to protect  victims  of
        abuse and torture and witnesses to  such  crimes.  This  makes  the
        willingness of individuals who have suffered torture or  abuse,  to
        report these incidents less likely as they have little assurance of
        protection from authorities in  a  situation  where  it  is  widely
        recognized that police and security forces are widely implicated in
        forms of torture, degrading treatment and abuse in detention and in
        order to obtain confessions, with reports  indicating  that  it  is
        widespread in Sri Lanka's policing practices and not just  utilized
        for high-profile targets.

        22.  These same reports also indicate regular  flouting  of  habeas
        corpus, irregular trial procedures,  intimidation  of  lawyers  and
        denial of access to legal counsel. Human  rights  advocacy  reports
        have also stated that lawyers, the police  and  judges  are  deeply
        inter-dependent socially, professionally and financially  and  this
        sometimes precludes the willingness of defence lawyers or judges to
        challenge police evidence. It is reasonable to deduce that  such  a
        context acts as a significant constraint upon  the  willingness  of
        people to report or publicise incidents where  they  have  suffered
        torture or abuse and therefore in turn a check upon the quantity of
        cases that appear in the media."

67. There was almost no post-arrival monitoring by NGOs or the BHC of  what
    happened to returnees.  He had no reason to doubt reports of abductions
    and arrests ('white van abductions') at or near  the  airport,  at  bus
    stops or at checkpoints.  His research was based on internet materials,
    in particular TamilNet, and on personal sources whom he spoke  to  when
    he needed information.

Appendix E - FFT witnesses

68. There were two witnesses for FFT, the first being Professor  Sir  Nigel
    Rodley, who set out the management structure of FFT and  the  scale  of
    the important work it does in helping individual torture survivors  and
    providing medico legal reports where appropriate.  Professor Rodley has
    a long history of working with testimony of torture,  both  at  Amnesty
    International (17 years) and in his nine years as UN Special Rapporteur
    on Torture.  He had oversight  of  the  FFT  submissions  to  UNCAT  in
    November 2011 and the 13 September 2012 Briefing, but the research  was
    that of Ms Jo Pettitt.

69. Professor Rodley had written to the Minister  to  ask  him  to  suspend
    removal of Tamils while the UKBA policy was  adjusted  to  reflect  the
    evidence produced in those reports.  The Minister had asked for further
    information on the individuals concerned.   Professor  Rodley  strongly
    agreed with FFT's refusal to provide that  information.   He  gave  six
    reasons:  breach  of  client  confidentiality  and  the  difficulty  of
    obtaining consent from the individuals after  their  details  had  been
    used; the high regard in which FFT was  held,  including  expressly  by
    UKBA, such that its word should be enough; UKBA's request was perceived
    as part of a pattern of other governments which were  also  seeking  to
    challenge its research methods; possible deterrence of individuals whom
    FFT might ask to take  part  in  future  research  projects;  the  best
    interests of FFT's clients; and FFT's status  as  a  source  of  expert
    evidence against the Secretary of  State,   such  that  discussing  the
    details directly with the UKBA was inappropriate.

70. Professor Rodley was also  responsible  for  writing  to  the  Treasury
    Solicitor to complain about the content of the UKBA October 2012 Policy
    Bulletin and the comments therein about FFT.  The  complaint  had  been
    acknowledged but not answered.

71. In his oral evidence, Professor Rodley accepted  that  even  documented
    evidence of torture was not evidence of how or where it  had  occurred:
    however,  he  had  confidence  in  the  skills  of  FFT's   experienced
    clinicians and, having sat in on some of their interviews, also in  the
    rigour of their  approach.   He  considered  they  were  more  reliable
    assessors of torture accounts than decision makers or judges, who  were
    hampered by the quality of representation before them and their lack of
    medical expertise.

72. In relation to  the  confidentiality  point,  Professor  Rodley's  oral
    evidence was the same as his written evidence and it came to this: that
    FFT is a highly respected provider of  medico  legal  reports  and  its
    evidence should simply be accepted.  There should be no requirement for
    it to be tested in any other way.

73. Some of the questions Professor  Rodley  was  asked  were  outside  his
    expertise:  he was  asked  about  the  lack  of  evidence  in  the  FFT
    composite  report  about  methods  of  escape,  which  he  stated   was
    irrelevant to the assessment of the harm and the treatment,  which  was
    always FFT's focus; he was asked about the signing  of  confessions  in
    the Sinhalese  language,  returnees  from  other  countries,  and  exit
    methods.  His answers on these points indicated that these  areas  were
    not within his knowledge.

74. Ms Jo  Pettitt  is  the  researcher  responsible  for  the  work  which
    underlies the two composite reports on Sri Lanka, the UNCAT  submission
    and the Briefing.  FFT's country reporting programme is relatively  new
    and is intended as a systematic analysis of patterns  and  evidence  of
    torture  in  particular  countries,  with  a  view  to  holding  states
    accountable.  Contrary to Professor Rodley's concerns, where Ms Pettitt
    was using MLR data prepared by FFT, she had  sought  consent  from  the
    individuals concerned, but had received it  from  only  half  of  those
    approached.  There were also other less  detailed  pieces  of  evidence
    which she had considered.  The statistical evidence is considered later
    in this determination and set out in the Appendix.

75. Ms Pettitt had not met the individuals:  she had worked from the  paper
    files and medico legal reports.  She had not analysed  those  who  were
    not accepted by FFT as torture survivors; there was no indication as to
    the scale of any differential;  and  she  had  not  looked  beyond  the
    medical elements of the reports.   The  numbers  who  fell  within  the
    period and profile which FFT wished to analyse were  very  small.   The
    information was heavily redacted and she was not authorised or  willing
    to go beyond that redaction.

Appendix F - HRW

76. The HRW evidence was that of Mr Brad  Adams,  the  organisation's  Asia
    Director in New York, and Ms Charu Lata Hogg, a researcher  at  Chatham
    House who, although she was called  by  the  third  appellant,  was  so
    constrained by her contractual relationship with HRW that her  evidence
    must properly be considered as the evidence of that organisation.   The
    evidence of both witnesses concerned the preparation and publication of
    HRW's report:  "We will teach you a  lesson:  sexual  violence  against
    Tamils by the Sri Lankan security forces"[6].  The report was published
    on 26 February 2013 and Ms Hogg was the  researcher  whose  statistical
    work informed the report.

77. Mr Adams was not available to give oral evidence  and  his  application
    not to do so was supported by the  parties;  he  lives  in  California,
    where it was night at the time when the Tribunal  wished  to  hear  his
    oral evidence.  He provided two witness statements in  March  2013,  to
    which, absent his oral evidence, we can give only limited  weight.   Mr
    Adams' evidence was that HRW did not consider that every Tamil returned
    to Sri Lanka was at risk.  However, torture, rape and sexual abuse were
    common in detention in Sri Lanka.

78. The February 2013 report set out HRW's recommendations to the GOSL:  to
    investigate and prosecute all  rape  and  sexual  violence  allegations
    against the Sri Lankan security forces, before and after the civil war,
    ending the culture of impunity; to repeal the PTA  and  the  system  of
    detention without charge or trial; to lift the access  restrictions  to
    the Northern Province to allow medical personnel, counsellors, and NGOs
    providing psycho-social support and independent medical examination and
    treatment to reach victims of human rights violations;   to  charge  or
    release those held under emergency or anti-terrorism laws;  to  conduct
    prompt trials meeting international due process norms; to  ensure  that
    all ranks of the security services receive proper training on 'civilian
    protection'; to disclose the whereabouts of detainees and rehabilitees,
    maintaining a computerised accessible database of the  information  and
    allowing  family  and  medical  visits;  to  institute  a   reparations
    programme; and to:

      "l.   Ratify the following  international  conventions:  the  Optional
      Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
      or  Degrading  Treatment  or  Punishment;  the  Rome  Statute  of  the
      International Criminal Court; and the International Convention for the
      Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance;

      m.    Invite and  facilitate  the  visits  of  UN  special  procedures
      including the UN special rapporteur on torture, the UN  Working  Group
      on  Arbitrary  Detention,   the   UN   Working   Group   on   Enforced
      Disappearances, the UN special rapporteur on violence  against  women,
      and the UN special  rapporteur  on  the  independence  of  judges  and
      lawyers."

79. Dealing specifically with the charter flights and publicity,  Mr  Adams
    confirmed that HRW had released information in May and  September  2012
    close to the date of the charter flights in order to influence both the
    United Kingdom public and government to prevent the  intended  returns.
    He denied that the same was true of the latest report, which he  stated
    had been prepared for the UN meeting in March 2013.

80. He confirmed the contractual restrictions on  Ms  Hogg  preventing  her
    from disclosing voluntarily unpublished names  or  information  without
    HRW's permission, which would be  withheld  if  confidentiality  issues
    were at stake.

81. The evidence of Ms Charu Lata Hogg was heard over two days,  the  first
    before publication of the report, and the second after publication. She
    provided three reports, on 21 January and 28 January 2013,  and  on  12
    March 2013. She set out the restrictions on her evidence in  the  first
    report:

       "2. The names,  place  of  residence  and  as  well  as  potentially
       incriminating  details  of  the  dates  and  locations  of  victims'
       detention and abuse have in the majority been  withheld  to  address
       concerns about their vulnerability  to  possible  reprisals  by  Sri
       Lankan security forces should information in this report  enter  the
       public domain. I have included information from sources  I  consider
       reliable based on my knowledge and experience on Sri Lanka.  I  have
       provided as much detail on the sources as can  be  safely  provided.
       Given the vulnerability of sources in Sri Lanka,  I  would  like  to
       request the court to omit mentioning specific names and  details  on
       individual sources in the decision as this could potentially lead to
       the identification of these sources by Sri  Lankan  authorities  and
       make them vulnerable to future ill-treatment."

82. We deal in detail with the statistical evidence provided by Ms Hogg  in
    the Appendix, and it is assessed later in this determination.  In  more
    general observations, Ms Hogg noted the  authoritarian  nature  of  the
    current government in Sri  Lanka.   Her  report  quoted  Dr  Pakiasothy
    Saravanamuttu of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, as follows:

       "30. ..."The current government in Sri Lanka is strong but  insecure
       because of a variety of factors which include  on-going  allegations
       of war crimes in its defeat of the LTTE; any development which could
       potentially challenge its main achievement, the defeat of the  LTTE,
       and thereby contest its success; the  fear  of  loss  of  protection
       should the leaders suddenly be stripped  of  official  position  and
       power; and finally the fact that the  government  is  entrenching  a
       dynastic project."

83. A three-member advisory panel appointed in 2010 by UN Secretary-General
    Ban had not been permitted to visit Sri Lanka; its intended  visit  was
    widely perceived as the precursor to a war crimes trial.  The LLRC  was
    the GOSL's own investigation:  HRW, Amnesty International and  ICG  had
    refused to give evidence before it, on  legitimacy  grounds.  In  April
    2011, the UN panel had reported (without visiting Sri  Lanka)  and  had
    criticised the behaviour of the Sri Lankan government  forces  and  the
    LTTE at the end of the civil war.

84. There were significant restrictions  on  freedom  of  the  press,  with
    journalists self-censoring and also suffering physical attacks if  they
    wrote or spoke against the r�gime. Those who  aligned  themselves  with
    western perceptions were considered  to  be  'traitors...betraying  the
    motherland'.   The  Sri  Lankan  judiciary  was   under   pressure;   a
    Parliamentary Select Committee had sought to impeach the Chief Justice;
    the Supreme Court had held that to be ultra vires;  the  Chief  Justice
    was nevertheless removed from office.

85. Corruption was widespread, and almost any service  could  be  purchased
    for a price. Sri Lanka  was  79th  of  176  countries  in  Transparency
    International's Corruption Index. The government was a family business:

       "83. Nepotism and clientelism is rife in  Sri  Lanka  and  political
       office  has  traditionally  been  used  to  perpetuate   power   and
       accumulate wealth. ... Mahinda Rajapaksa's election as President  in
       2005 broke the stranglehold of power by a small, higher  class  clan
       of political elite. Since then, the government is dominated  by  the
       President's family with two of his brothers  holding  key  executive
       branch  posts  as  Defense  Secretary  and  minister   of   economic
       development , while  a  third  brother  serves  as  the  Speaker  of
       Parliament.  A  large  number  of  other  relatives,  including  the
       president's son, also serve in  important  political  or  diplomatic
       positions. The culture of  nepotism  goes  beyond  the  echelons  of
       political power and is noticeable in the civil services,  judiciary,
       police and other divisions of state administration."

86. The former paramilitary forces  had  no  role  in  peacetime:   various
    groups had staked out areas in Vavuniya where they were responsible for
    most of the killings, abductions, extortions and threats.  "White  van"
    abductions  were  occurring,  mainly  for  ransom  and  extortion,  but
    sometimes also for the purpose of passing individuals to  the  security
    services. The EPDP was working closely with  the  Sri  Lankan  security
    forces.

87. The Sri Lankan government  now  proceeds  on  the  basis  of  'superior
    intelligence gathering abilities and mechanisms', a conscious change to
    its security strategy. Intelligence gathering since the civil  war  had
    been impressively effective, as some former high ranking  LTTE  members
    had cooperated with the authorities.  The authorities had sophisticated
    intelligence about LTTE cadres and supporters,  both  domestically  and
    abroad.  In an interview with  The  Sunday  Leader  in  May  2012,  the
    Defence Secretary said:

      "There is no need now for search and cordon operations or having  many
      road blocks, checkpoints or rounding up people for  questioning.  That
      is no longer necessary. But there are other methods to keep  vigilant.
      Especially on the intelligence  side  -  we  have  increased  military
      intelligence units. We are training them more  and  more  in  advanced
      methods so they can gather information on these affairs  and  have  an
      early warning. Then we keep an eye on certain people that we know have
      been engaged in  criminal  activity.  Certain  people  who  have  been
      rehabilitated  and  released  -  some  have  adjusted  very  well  and
      integrated extremely well... some are working happily in various jobs,
      some are engaged in their own work. But there are  a  few  people  not
      terrorists but  engaged  in  normal  criminal  activity.  There  is  a
      possibility these  people  may  get  involved  in  terrorist  activity
      again".

88. There had been no recent large-scale searches in Colombo and there were
    far fewer checkpoints there now. Tamils still had difficulty in finding
    work and  accommodation  in  Colombo;  for  migrants,  Tamil  community
    support was required  even  in  densely  populated  Tamil  areas.   The
    migrant  Tamil  population  was  in  a  different  position  from   the
    integrated Tamils who had been there much longer and  spoke  Sinhalese.
    Her second supplementary report indicated that 24 of  the  victims  had
    been picked up in Colombo.  In answer to questions  from  Mr  Hall,  Ms
    Hogg amplified that comment, stating that she had not analysed  whether
    they had been  detained  before  or  after  May  2009  in  relation  to
    detention by location.

89. Torture in detention continued in a culture  of  impunity.   Those  who
    were detained included former conscripts  and  administrators  for  the
    LTTE.  Confessions were extracted for future use, although, as Ms  Hogg
    acknowledged, as  a  matter  of  law  confessions  obtained  under  PTA
    detention could not be used in court and  would  have  to  be  obtained
    again.

90. Ms Hogg was unaware of any hard evidence of genuine  LTTE  activity  in
    Sri Lanka, nor any independent evidence of resurgence of  the  LTTE  in
    the diaspora. Her interviews with experts led to the conclusion that:

      "... while fund raising for the Tamil cause in the diaspora  continues
      to remain active and there remains a residual nostalgia for  the  LTTE
      within Sri Lanka, chances of a revival of the LTTE remain dim".

91. However, the GOSL remained  concerned.   Interest  was  high  in  those
    returning from the United Kingdom, particularly because of  the  United
    Kingdom's traditional role in  fundraising  for  the  LTTE.   Only  the
    United Kingdom returned Sri Lankan citizens by charter flight. Although
    there was some protection from harm at  the  airport,  the  Sri  Lankan
    security forces would pick up anyone in whom they were interested  from
    their home address.   Those  without  an  identity  card  might  be  at
    additional risk, since that would alert the authorities that  they  had
    not been screened and might not have undergone rehabilitation.

92. The GOSL considered that  Tamil  Nadu,  in  India,  and  Australia  had
    significant numbers of LTTE activists.  LTTE activity was considered to
    exist also in France, Germany, Norway,  Sweden,  Belgium,  Switzerland,
    South Africa, New Zealand and Canada.  The GOSL was concerned about the
    current role of the worldwide diaspora, and was seeking:

      "...to acquire intelligence on  the  activities  of  this  politically
      active diaspora, particularly on  its  contribution  to  international
      moves towards an inquiry into alleged  war  crimes  committed  by  the
      state in its 2009 defeat of the LTTE ...  to  send  a  signal  to  the
      diaspora that any involvement in an international campaign against Sri
      Lanka would result in harsh consequences".

93. The GOSL was a paranoid organisation which needed to  ensure  that  the
    LTTE remained a threat, to  justify  its  militarisation  amounting  to
    occupation of the Northern  Province.   Ms  Hogg  set  out  a  list  of
    organisations which the GOSL regarded as LTTE fronts worldwide:

           .  Tamil  Rehabilitation  Organization  /   International   Tamil
             Rehabilitation Organization),
           . White Pigeon,
           . British Tamil Association (BTA),
           . World Tamil Movement (WTM),
           . Tamil Coordinating Committee (TCC),
           . British Tamil Forum (BTF),
           . Tamil  Youth  Organization  (TYO)  (branches  in  12  countries
             including the United Kingdom)
           . Coordinating Committee of Tamils-France (CCTF).
           .  Tamil  Coordinating  Committee  (TCC)  (in  Germany,   Norway,
             Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, South  Africa,  Belgium  &  New
             Zealand)
           . World Tamil Movement (WTM) (Canada); and
           . World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC) (Switzerland).

94. There were 20,000 children in Tamil-run schools worldwide,  which  were
    not under the supervision of national education systems and  were  used
    for propaganda purposes.  The GOSL had concerns about the curriculum in
    those schools and whether they were being used to raise and train a new
    generation of insurgents.

95.  The rehabilitation process was accurately described by the UKBA in its
    current Country of Origin Report.  It was a process of detention:   the
    normal period was two years, though some had been detained for  longer.
    After release, reporting and  residence  conditions  were  imposed  and
    rehabilitees could be rearrested  if  perceived  as  'stepping  out  of
    line'.

96. In her oral evidence, Ms Hogg said  that  nobody  knew  how  many  were
    detained under the PTA.  There was  active  reconstruction  of  damaged
    infrastructure in the Northern  Province,  but  only  by  and  for  the
    benefit of the Sri Lankan  military  occupation:   banks,  restaurants,
    vegetable shops and so  on  were  being  reopened  in  military  hands.
    Tamils had not participated in the economic growth; they  were  reduced
    to the status of  witnesses  of  the  reconstruction  in  the  Northern
    Province. The GOSL was aware that some  of  those  returning  from  the
    diaspora had been economic migrants.

97. The statistical evidence provided by Ms Hogg was based on  a  group  of
    120 interviewees, a mixture of  torture  victims,  family  members  and
    witnesses of torture.  Only 31 of them had been detained  and  tortured
    after the end of the conflict:  12 in 2010, 11 in 2011 and 8  in  2012.
    Some of them had been interviewed over Skype because they were still in
    Sri Lanka but most had been interviewed by her in the  United  Kingdom,
    with a trusted interpreter assigned by HRW.  All had  provided  medical
    evidence, in most cases medico legal  reports  but  sometimes  ordinary
    medical reports.

98. The names of the doctors involved were not disclosed: HRW  had  decided
    that was inappropriate on confidentiality grounds.  Nothing that  might
    give away the present location of  the  victims  was  to  be  disclosed
    unless specifically cleared with the victim.  26 of  the  victims  were
    picked up and detained in Colombo; they included a Sinhalese man, three
    Muslims, and a member of the Frontline Socialist Party.  There were  13
    Tamils in the group, two of whom were included in the  group  reflected
    in the HRW submissions in May and September 2012.

Appendix G - TAG

99. Many of the witnesses we heard were found and paid for by TAG  but  are
    categorised according to  the  type  of  evidence  they  give  and  its
    sources. The only witness whose evidence was specific to TAG was Ms Jan
    Jananayagam.  Ms Jananayagam has been  involved  with  pro  bono  Tamil
    community projects for 10 years,  latterly  specifically  TAG  and  TAG
    (Europe),  which  prepared  and  published  the  "Returnees  at   Risk"
    report[7]. She had taken a sabbatical from her financial  services  job
    for a year to produce it.

100. The report was based on United Kingdom judicial determinations  on  Sri
    Lankan returnees and was prepared by a multi-disciplinary team selected
    by Ms Jananayagam.  The data set was sourced through a small number  of
    intermediate professionals  who  were  willing  to  introduce  suitable
    asylum  seekers.   She  did  not  regard  the  set   of   examples   as
    representative and it was not her case that "all Tamils" were  at  risk
    on return. In particular,  she  did  not  consider  that  there  was  a
    specific category of students at risk; rather, her researcher had  been
    to see some of the same people as seen by  HRW's  researcher,  and  the
    asylum appeals had already  been  given  to  HRW.   Only  the  students
    remained, which distorted the sample.

101. She was also conscious of the small size of the sample and the lack  of
    any balance between  successful  and  unsuccessful  appeals.  They  had
    worked on the basis that if voluntary returnees were at risk, that must
    mean that failed asylum seekers were also at risk.  The  abuse  in  the
    data set had peaked in the three months following the  release  of  the
    first of the "Sri Lanka's Killing Fields" documentary series by Channel
    4, in June 2011.

102. The risk was to those perceived to have  useful  information  (such  as
    details of the LTTE's banking, which was  the  case  with  one  of  the
    present appellants).  A membership card was not always necessary, since
    the GOSL recognised the existence of "civilian supporters".  During the
    period when the LTTE was the government in the  Northern  Province,  it
    had judges, civil servants and a whole state infrastructure.   Everyone
    had been involved to some extent: it was unavoidable.

103. Ms Jananayagam's name had been published on a list of LTTE "agents"  in
    the diaspora; she did not know who  had  prepared  the  list.   It  was
    indicative of the GOSL's mindset.  The GOSL had made it clear that they
    were monitoring contacts between diaspora  figures  and  those  in  Sri
    Lanka,  in  the  context  of  the  2012  Royal  Jubilee  and  President
    Rajapaksa's visit to the United Kingdom.  In particular,  TAG  and  the
    diaspora tried to find out who was travelling with President  Rajapaksa
    on foreign visits with a view to filing a war crimes complaint  against
    those they knew to have committed war crimes. The GOSL had stated  that
    it "knew what the diaspora was planning".  Local emails  and  telephone
    calls were monitored; some of  those  interviewed  had  been  asked  to
    identify photographs taken in the United Kingdom.   Ms  Jananayagam  no
    longer visited Sri Lanka personally or contacted people directly in Sri
    Lanka since an email from her was  likely  to  cause  trouble  for  the
    recipient.  TAG employed consultants to work "under cover".

104. Ms Jananayagam had  stood  as  an  independent  in  the  last  European
    elections and received 50,000 votes  on  a  platform  concerning  Tamil
    separatism and what TAG regarded as the 'genocide' in May 2009.

Mr Alan Keenan

105. An email from Mr Keenan of International Crisis  Group  (ICG)  dated  1
    February 2012 is relied on by TAG.  It is in an odd format for an email
    and bears no signature or supporting statement of truth.  This is  what
    it says:

      "...I can verify that in my work with the International Crisis  Group,
      I have come across at least one witness (Witness X) living  in  hiding
      outside of Sri Lanka who was approached  by  a  group  of  Sri  Lankan
      Tamils posing as journalists  attached  to  Channel  4  television  in
      Britain, which, as you know, had earlier produced a powerful and well-
      publicised documentary entitled "Sri Lanka's Killing Fields". The  Sri
      Lankan team claimed to be seeking evidence of war crimes committed  by
      the Sri Lankan security forces and sought to interview witness X for a
      follow-up Channel 4 documentary. Witness X declined but put  the  team
      in touch with two other Sri Lankan Tamils s/he knew who  were  willing
      to describe their experiences in the final phase  of  the  civil  war.
      Witness X never saw her/his two friends again, has not  been  able  to
      learn of their whereabouts and fears they have  been  abducted  and/or
      killed. Channel 4  staff  involved  in  making  "Sri  Lanka's  Killing
      Fields" confirm they never approached witness X and did not work  with
      any of those witnesses X described. They also confirm that  they  have
      heard from credible independent sources that others were also targeted
      by the same scam. I am not able to name the witness or reveals her/his
      location in order to protect them  from  almost  certain  torture  and
      death should they be located by Sri Lanka military intelligence."

Appendix H - Mr Callum Macrae

106. Mr Macrae, through his  company  Outsider  TV,  is  responsible  for  a
    series of films made  for  Channel  4  entitled  "Sri  Lanka's  Killing
    Fields" [2011], "Sri Lanka's Killing  Fields:  War  Crimes  Unpunished"
    [2012].[8]  A third film was shown to the UN meeting in March 2013  but
    is not yet available on Channel 4.  They  concern  the  events  in  May
    2009, rather than circumstances today.  His evidence is set out in full
    in the Appendix.

107. Mr Macrae's written evidence dealt in addition  with  the  increase  to
    Sri Lanka's  military  budget;  the  inadequate  commissioning  of  and
    response to the LLRC report; the opinion of the Sri Lankan  Army  Board
    that the diaspora was seeking to destabilise Sri Lanka and  constituted
    "a clear and present danger" to the national security of Sri Lanka.  He
    noted the purported impeachment of Chief Justice Bandaranayake and  the
    killing of the founding  editor  of  the  Sunday  Leader,  Mr  Lasantha
    Wickrematunge.

108. In his oral evidence, Mr Macrae  stated  that  the  GOSL  was  paranoid
    about its international reputation.  It was unsafe for him and his team
    to return to Sri Lanka;  Channel  4's  security  team  had  refused  to
    authorise it on workable terms.  He had not tried to enter  the  Vanni,
    since that was off limits to journalists.

109. The GOSL was rebuilding the  Northern  Province  but  not  as  a  Tamil
    homeland.  It was extremely dangerous to be a government critic in  Sri
    Lanka.  Almost 60 local media workers had  been  killed,  and  overseas
    media workers had been expelled.  At a gathering  of  the  Commonwealth
    Heads of Government in  Perth,  Australia,  in  2012,  the  Sri  Lankan
    President's media adviser had attacked  Mr  Macrae's  work  on  camera,
    waving his finger and saying  that  his  films  were  LTTE  funded  and
    "absolutely part of the global conspiracy to restart  the  civil  war".
    The GOSL distrusted the diaspora; the  worldwide  diaspora  itself  was
    riven with dissension and penetrated by GOSL agents.  The mistrust,  on
    all sides, was in his opinion well founded.

110. In cross-examination, Mr Macrae said he  had  not  been  to  Sri  Lanka
    since 2011, after the Japanese tsunami.  He became aware then of "white
    van disappearances" which seemed to be state sponsored.  The  GOSL  was
    funded by China, Iran, Israel and Pakistan.  Its  diplomats  in  India,
    Britain and Canada were military commanders,  ensuring  that  the  High
    Commissions would keep Colombo informed of developments there.

111. The Sri Lankan government was sinking, ever more deeply, into a  really
    dangerous place, a paranoid culture of ultra-nationalism.  The  country
    was military-run and regarded itself as still under siege, on the basis
    that at any moment the LTTE might revive the internal  armed  conflict.
    Almost every returning Tamil was regarded  with  deep  suspicion.   The
    Tamil  community  was  treated  as  a  threat,  which  needed   to   be
    marginalised.  Anyone with the mildest pro-Tamil opinion was a  threat.



112. Mr Macrae was unaware of the terms of the LLRC  recommendations  or  of
    express invitations by the GOSL to the Tamil  diaspora  to  return  and
    help rebuild the country.  His  opinion  was  that  the  GOSL  did  not
    distinguish between Tamils and the LTTE.  In re-examination, he  stated
    that that any assertion of Tamil identity  would  be  an  assertion  of
    separatism and a risk.  Sri Lanka was a very corrupt country and he was
    aware of a number of stories of release in return for money.

Appendix I - Professor Anthony Good

113. The key points in Professor Good's reports confirm that  Sri  Lanka  is
    now dominated by the Rajapaksa family.  Both the  authorities  and  the
    Tamil separatists circulate misleading,  and  even  false,  information
    within Sri Lanka and  abroad.   He  confirmed  the  18-month  detention
    without judicial supervision in the PTA and the continued incidence  of
    torture in detention.  Corruption and bribery were widespread;  release
    through payment of a bribe was extremely common.   There  were  200-300
    escapes a year from official detention centres, but  no  statistics  on
    informal detention centres.  Release did  not  necessarily  indicate  a
    lack of further adverse interest; there was evidence of  re-arrest  and
    abduction of former LTTE cadres on the Eastern Province  Coast  and  in
    the Northern Province, in both 2011 and 2012.

114. He confirmed the use of  "watch"  and  "stop"  lists  at  the  airport.
    Immigration Officers  did  not  have  the  underlying  data,  just  the
    instruction to "stop" or "watch" which  originated  from  the  security
    services.  Backgrounds of returning asylum seekers would  be  known  to
    the CID and SIS but immigration officials had access to their databases
    only on request.  There were CID and SIS personnel at the airport.

115. Virtually the entire population of the Vanni was interned and  screened
    at the end of the civil war, to  identify  LTTE  cadres.   Rehabilitees
    were given a release certificate, valid for 6 months, with  an  address
    at which they were required to reside.  They had to register  with  the
    military Civil Affairs Office and report as  required.   Many  remained
    under intensive surveillance after release.

116. The LTTE has lost  the  capacity  to  undertake  conventional  military
    conflict.  The Sri Lankan government continued energetically  to  track
    down those involved during the civil war, or suspected of it.   It  was
    extremely likely that the authorities actively  monitored  protests  in
    London and that anyone  known  to  have  participated  would  be  under
    suspicion.  Hundreds of  photographs  of  demonstrations  were  in  the
    public domain.  The GOSL had explicitly threatened to arrest those  who
    demonstrated against the visit of  President  Rajapaksa  to  London  in
    2010.  In addition to the LP/TK list of factors,  which  he  considered
    remained relevant, Professor Good recommended that the Tribunal add two
    more, those involved in demonstrations against the GOSL  overseas,  and
    those involved in independent media or human rights activities critical
    of the GOSL.

117. In oral evidence, Professor Good stated that although there were  media
    (print and electronic) in the Northern Province, they  were  restricted
    as to what they could report and were excluded from HSZs.

118. Although approximately 300,000 people had been screened at the  end  of
    the civil war, Professor Good did not know whether there had  been  any
    abuse of those screened; his opinion was that there  probably  had  not
    been.

119. Information from  a  mission  by  Office  fran�ais  de  protection  des
    r�fugi�s et apatrid�s (OFPRA)  to  Sri  Lanka  published  in  September
    2011[9] indicated that those screened were divided into categories A to
    E, with A being high-ranking LTTE figures and E  those  with  a  short-
    lived  LTTE  connection.   He  could  not  assist  further  as  to  the
    rehabilitation process.

120. Rehabilitees received IOM cards; the  IOM  kept  track  and  maintained
    records of rehabilitees.  He considered  that  the  number  of  persons
    reported as being picked up was low because families  had  been  warned
    not to complain.

121. He considered it obvious  that  the  GOSL  did  not  regard  all  Tamil
    returnees as a terrorist threat.  The largest  Tamil  diaspora  was  in
    Toronto, but the most active was in London.  The  Tamil  government  in
    exile was in New York:  in 2012, there had been  elections  across  the
    worldwide diaspora.  The Tamil Prime Minister in exile was  Visvanathan
    Rudrakumaran, the LTTE's former international legal advisor, now  a  US
    citizen living in New York.

Appendix J - Dr Chris Smith

122. Dr Smith provided four written reports.  He noted that after the  civil
    war, the 300,000 IDPs were issued with ration books and that there were
    records of them all.  He explained the screening process.

123. He stated that there  was  unequivocal  and  universal  relief  in  Sri
    Lanka, including among the Tamil population in the Vanni, at the end of
    the civil war.  The Sri Lankan security forces were seeking to identify
    any remnants and had made specific searches in the Eastern Province  in
    2012, believing that LTTE  cadres  had  returned  there.   There  is  a
    massive intelligence operation across the  Vanni,  with  every  village
    having a "catcher" or informant.  New arrivals are scrutinised  by  the
    "catcher".  Not having been screened in May 2009  would  not  have  any
    particular consequences.  The authorities relied on the  "watch"  list,
    an electronic  database  of  individuals  of  adverse  interest,  which
    triggered covert surveillance.

124. An  identity  card  was  required  for  employment,  accommodation  and
    medical care.  It could be replaced in the  home  area,  but  that  was
    easier if you still had a passport, birth certificate, or serial number
    from a previous identity card.  Estimates  suggested  that  there  were
    100,000 Tamils without identity cards at the  end  of  the  civil  war.
    Within the Vanni, during the  2012  sweep  for  returned  LTTE  cadres,
    anyone travelling without a Sri Lankan identity card was detained.

125. Every detention resulted  in  a  record  being  raised.   There  was  a
    centralised database, lodged with the Ministry of  Rehabilitation,  the
    SIS and military intelligence, with details of all LTTE suspects.   The
    CID do not have unlimited access to this database.  They can access  it
    only on a case by case basis. What is available at the airport  is  the
    "watch" and "stop" electronic databases.  Staff at the SLHC passed  all
    details of applications for travel documents to Colombo,  and  incoming
    flights were required to fax their passenger manifest in advance.

126. Not all Tamil asylum seekers abroad  were  of  adverse  interest;  that
    despite public statements by  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  that  "all
    asylum seekers are terrorists", the evidence indicated that  they  knew
    that many are economic migrants. Scarring alone is  not  a  significant
    issue but may contribute  to  "rousing  suspicion",  in  that  detained
    persons are stripped to their underwear during interrogation, at  which
    time scars would be evident.

127. In 2011, UNHCR data indicated that 75% of  those  using  its  voluntary
    repatriation scheme were contacted in their homes by the  army  or  the
    police:  every returnee to the Vanni was required to register with  the
    authorities on arrival.

128. The GOSL had sophisticated intelligence, and  was  now  monitoring  and
    blocking websites as well as tapping telephones.   In  2012,  the  GOSL
    admitted that it was routinely tapping the telephones  of  687  people,
    including those of politicians, religious  leaders,  newspaper  editors
    and journalists.  Bribery and corruption were rampant and the judiciary
    and police wholly ineffective in combating them.

129. In Colombo, well integrated Tamils with  no  LTTE  connections  had  no
    real problems.  However, Tamils with identity cards from other parts of
    Sri Lanka would attract attention and risked detention  if  they  could
    not explain why they were in Colombo.

130. In his oral evidence, Dr Smith stated that he had not seen  the  "stop"
    and "watch"  list  database.   He  had  discussed  with  a  Sri  Lankan
    intelligence officer what it contained:  reasons for adverse  interest,
    biographical and family data. His experience of the airport checkpoints
    in Colombo was limited to the treatment of foreigners:  he did not know
    what happened to Sri Lankans there.   The  atmosphere  in  Colombo  had
    improved; there were still a few checkpoints there.

131. As to whether a person who had been released informally from  detention
    was likely to be the subject of an arrest warrant, Dr Smith's  evidence
    was based on speculation; he had no knowledge of the processes by which
    families obtained such release,  or  their  official  consequences.  He
    agreed that if no arrest warrant was issued, then the  "stop"  database
    at Colombo airport would have no record  of  such  a  person.   In  the
    Vanni, he understood that the occupying military kept track  of  former
    LTTE cadres and sympathisers through a highly  developed  network.  His
    understanding was that those screened at the end of the civil  war  had
    not been ill-treated.

132. Dr Smith did not know much about the  position  of  those  photographed
    when attending London demonstrations:  the only thing  he  was  certain
    of, in relation to the face recognition question, was that  there  were
    no cameras at Colombo airport.  The  mere  fact  of  being  a  returned
    asylum seeker would not of itself cause adverse interest in a person at
    the airport; if, when interviewed at the  airport,  they  were  not  of
    adverse interest, they would be allowed to proceed.

133. Dr Smith stood by his general evidence in TK,  save that  he  was  less
    sure that there was a comprehensive exchange of records between CID and
    SIS.  Paper records were being uploaded in reverse chronological order.
     Police stations in the Northern Province were  not  yet  computerised,
    though all police stations were to be networked nationally soon.

Appendix K - other country evidence

134.  The evidence of four more country witnesses was received. Dr  Sutharan
    Nadarajah provided both written and oral evidence.   The  Tribunal  did
    not have the opportunity to hear the oral evidence of  Professor  Rohan
    Gunaratna, Dr Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu or Mr Anton Punethanayagam.

135. Professor Rohan  Gunaratna  is  the  architect  of  the  rehabilitation
    process; he helped the GOSL to design, develop, implement and  evaluate
    it.  He is also an expert on the LTTE, on which he has  published  many
    books.  He was called  as  a  witness  for  the  first  appellant,  and
    confirmed that the first  appellant's  knowledge  and  account  of  his
    activities contained matters known only to those involved in the secret
    finance wing of the LTTE.  He considered the first appellant's  account
    to be accurate and credible.

136.  He explained the differences between how selection for  rehabilitation
    was  made  in  2009  and  now,  but  did  not  give  details   of   the
    rehabilitation programme itself.  Whereas all  identified  LTTE  cadres
    had been rehabilitated in the 2009 tranche, the GOSL's approach in 2013
    was to send to rehabilitation those who it believed could benefit  from
    it.  The selection was  nuanced,  and  guided  by  concerns  about  the
    resurgence of the LTTE in the diaspora. The decision whether to  detain
    and rehabilitate was made  after  a  fact-specific  assessment  by  the
    police, the security and the intelligence  services  working  together.
    The 45 rehabilitees placed back in rehabilitation in Jaffna in December
    2012 had been arrested because the security services believed  them  to
    be in contact with LTTE operatives in the diaspora.

137. He confirmed  that  it  was  his  understanding  that  when  being  re-
    documented for return to Sri Lanka at  SLHCs  abroad,  applicants  were
    routinely asked  about  past  LTTE  links.   There  were  no  detention
    facilities at the airport; if a returnee was of interest by reason with
    past or current links with known LTTE front organisations abroad,  they
    would be invited for interview once they had returned home, rather than
    at the airport.

138. Professor Gunaratna's report exhibited  a  report[10]  on  Sri  Lanka's
    Defence Ministry website, recording a joint briefing carried out by him
    in Australia on 3 January 2012, with the Australian  High  Commissioner
    for Sri Lanka, Admiral Thisara Samarasinghe.  Professor Gunaratna  said
    this:

           ""Professor  Gunaratna  began  proceedings  by  explaining   the
           magnitude of the terrorist threat that Sri Lanka had to face and
           the sophistication and brutality of the LTTE which  was  finally
           defeated militarily in 2009. He explained the  circumstances  of
           the humanitarian rescue operation undertaken by  the  Sri  Lanka
           Government to rescue  300,000  civilians  who  were  being  held
           hostage  as  human  shields.  Speaking  of  his  involvement  in
           developing a  programme  for  the  rehabilitation  of  LTTE  ex-
           combatants,  he  said  that  the  programme   had   successfully
           rehabilitated and reintegrated most of  those  that  surrendered
           (11,600) save a few hundred who have been  heavily  involved  in
           terrorist activities against whom judicial action would be taken
           depending on evidence available."

139. High Commissioner Samarasinghe said:

           "The High Commissioner said further that he was deeply concerned
           about certain elements in the diaspora  in  Australia  who  were
           intent  on  destroying  the  processes  of  reconciliation   and
           economic development taking place in Sri Lanka by  continuing  a
           campaign of separatism. He highlighted the involvement of  these
           diaspora members in LTTE and LTTE front activities and said that
           they have already begun fundraising campaigns for the  cause  of
           creating a separate state of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka. He  added
           that these front organisations were similar to those set  up  by
           the LTTE in the Eighties, through which they  raised  funds  and
           procured arms and ammunition to unleash terrorism in Sri  Lanka.
           ...The High  Commissioner  concluded  his  presentation  with  a
           photograph depicting a recent marriage  which  had  taken  place
           between a Sri Lankan soldier and a  former  LTTE  combatant.  He
           said that reconciliation was happening in Sri Lanka between  the
           two communities and the pro-LTTE diaspora should not be  allowed
           to derail that process."

140. Dr Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu is  a  prominent  human  rights  campaigner
    based in Colombo,  with  an  international  reputation.   In  2009,  he
    received death threats and was detained by the TID at Colombo  airport.
    He was awarded Sri Lanka's National  Peace  Council's  first  Citizens'
    Peace Award  in  2010,  established  "to  honour  and  encourage  those
    individuals  in  civil  society  who  have  demonstrated  courage   and
    consistency in the protection of and respect for human rights; peaceful
    settlement of disputes and promoting  increased  understanding  between
    and among communities"[11]. Dr Saravanamuttu  remains  the  subject  of
    hostile comment, including a poster campaign in 2013, for his views  on
    human rights, governance and transparency in Sri Lanka.

141. Dr Saravanamuttu declined  to  answer  all  of  the  agreed  questions,
    citing pressure of time.  He  dealt  with  the  tight  control  by  the
    Rajapaksa family, the impeachment of Chief Justice  Bandaranayake,  and
    the events at the end of the civil war.  He noted that  there  remained
    serious housing problems for those released from  Menik  Farm  Camp  in
    September 2012, especially as many had homes in the HSZs to which  they
    could not yet return.  The Sinhalisation of Tamil areas included:

      "...renaming of places and the building of religious  markers  of  the
      majority community in areas predominantly inhabited  by  the  minority
      Tamil, Hindu and Christian communities as well as demographic change."

142. Dealing with deficiencies in the LLRC's report and its  implementation,
    Mr Saravanamuttu set out the nuanced position it took on the  May  2009
    events:

      "62. On accountability the LLRC falls short, endorsing the GOSL  stand
      that it did not target civilians.  The  LLRC  however,  concedes  that
      inadvertently, GOSL forces could have been  responsible  for  civilian
      deaths and calls for an investigation of  these  instances.  The  LLRC
      also  states  that  the  Channel  4   documentary   contains   serious
      allegations against the reputation and standing of the GOSL  and  that
      an investigation to clear the name and reputation of the  GOSL  is  in
      order. It further calls for the re-opening of investigations into  the
      murder of 17 humanitarian workers in 2006 and the killing of  5  Tamil
      students on the beach in Trincomalee in the Eastern Province, also  in
      2006.

      63. On reconciliation and governance, the LLRC endorses  a  number  of
      proposals and positions taken by civil society for over a  decade.  In
      respect of the Rule of Law, the LLRC recommends the separation of  the
      Sri Lankan police from the Ministry of Defence, independent  oversight
      commissions be established as under  the  now  jettisoned  Seventeenth
      Amendment to the Constitution and  that  a  Special  Commissioner  for
      Disappearances be appointed. It also calls for  Right  to  Information
      legislation and a Victim and Witness Protection Act. ...

      65. The GOSL has come up with a National  Human  Rights  Action  Plan,
      which  was  presented  at  the  UPR  and  an  Action  Plan   for   the
      Implementation of the LLRC recommendations in July 2012. ...

      66. Critiques of the Action Plan have pointed to its selectivity, lack
      of clarity in respect of commencement and  the  over-reliance  on  the
      Ministry  of  Defence  and  a  parliamentary  select   committee   for
      implementation."

143. Mr Anton Punethanayagam is a barrister who has  practised  at  the  Sri
    Lankan Bar in both Colombo and Vavuniya and has represented about  3000
    persons detained under the PTA over the last two decades.  His standing
    in the legal community in Sri Lanka is high[12].

144. Mr Punethanayagam's opinion was that the  GOSL  now  focuses  on  armed
    Tamil resurgence rather than past activities.  The closing of the camps
    in 2012 was a propaganda measure, since many persons  remained  in  the
    camps as their home areas were unavailable, either  being  occupied  by
    the army or still in HSZs and subject to demining.  Insufficient detail
    is available as to what happened to all the LTTE cadres and members who
    surrendered at the end of the civil war; some  senior  members  of  the
    LTTE were occasionally brought before the courts but did not get a fair
    trial, in his opinion.  There was no  public  record  of  who  remained
    alive and detained.

145. He dealt with  the  expiry  of  the  Emergency  Regulations  and  their
    incorporation into the PTA,  as  well  as  the  arrest  of  the  Jaffna
    students attempting to celebrate Martyrs  Day  after  the  LLRC  report
    recommended that Tamils should be permitted to do so. He dealt also  at
    some length with the attacks on the independence of the judiciary,  and
    the purported impeachment  of  Chief  Justice  Bandaranayake,  who  was
    removed and was replaced by Attorney  General  Mohan  Peiris,  a  close
    associate of President Rajapaksa: Mr Peiris represented the GOSL at the
    UNCAT hearings in 2011.

146.  Approximately  thirty  of  Mr  Punethanayagam's  3,000   clients   had
    contacted him after having left Sri Lanka  when  of  adverse  interest,
    using bribery.  He did not say when  that  had  occurred.   Information
    from Mr Punethanayagam's client database about the use of  bribery  was
    as follows:

      "26.  ...The paramilitary groups, working alongside  the  SLA,  assist
      the escape of detainees in order to extort money. In  my  practice,  I
      have come across several cases where the families  use  bribery  as  a
      last resort to secure the release of a detainee with the assistance of
      members of the security forces or paramilitary groups.

      27. The bribery is very common  in  the  IDP  camps  as  well  as  the
      detention centers from which even known LTTE leaders have  managed  to
      escape on payment of bribes. Hence  it  cannot  be  argued  that  only
      people of low interest to the authorities are  able  to  secure  their
      release through a bribe. In my  opinion,  it  is  plausible  that  the
      detainee was released following the payment of a  bribe,  even  if  of
      significant adverse interest to the authorities. It is  unlikely  that
      the person who accepts the bribe would access  the  detainee's  record
      and change them as released or no  longer  wanted.  Hence  such  cases
      would normally be recorded as escaped from detention in  the  database
      of the Police. Subsequently an absconder action will be commenced  and
      the detainee's details would be passed to  the  National  Intelligence
      Bureau.

      28. It is possible to leave the country using bribery with the help of
      an agent. The  security  officers  and  immigration  officers  at  the
      international airport are no exception to the widespread  bribery  and
      corruption in Sri Lanka. It is always possible for  a  person  to  use
      influence or bribery to get through the airport without being detained
      as an LTTE suspect. I have been contacted by approximately 30  clients
      who managed to flee the country via the international  airport  whilst
      in the adverse interest of the authorities and I provided evidence  in
      their asylum cases in the UK, Canada, France,  Norway  and  Australia.
      Therefore leaving through the airport either with his/her own passport
      or false identity does not necessarily indicate a lack of interest  on
      the part of the authorities."

147. The witness' opinion that absconder action would be commenced  after  a
    person was released on payment of a bribe is not sourced.

148. Dr Suthaharan Nadarajah is a lecturer at the Centre  for  International
    Studies  and  Diplomacy  at  SOAS.   His  research  covers  the   Tamil
    diaspora's changing relations in the last decade  with  the  GOSL,  the
    LTTE, and the  international  community.   He  is  writing  a  book  on
    international interventions for security and peace in Sri  Lanka  since
    2000.

149. He noted the increasing politicisation of the diaspora worldwide.   The
    London diaspora had staged  some  of  the  most  dramatic  large  scale
    protests.  The GOSL's attitude to the diaspora had hardened to  one  of
    hostility and suspicion.  They considered the diaspora to  be  plotting
    LTTE resurgence, threatening not just  the  Rajapaksa  family  but  the
    unitary Sri Lankan state; the diaspora's activities were  perceived  as
    having a negative effect on the  image  of  Sri  Lanka  worldwide.   In
    addition, the GOSL considered that the diaspora  hosted  potential  war
    crimes witnesses and provided an opportunity  for  pan-Tamil  political
    coordination outside the influence of the Sri Lankan authorities.

150. The aim of the Sri Lankan authorities was  to  monitor,  interrupt  and
    prevent connections between Tamils in Sri Lanka and diaspora  activists
    worldwide; some Tamils in the diaspora worked with the  GOSL  reporting
    diaspora activities and identifying activists within the diaspora.

151. The GOSL had put great effort  into  thwarting  any  international  war
    crimes prosecutions or  investigation  in  relation  to  the  May  2009
    events, and those suspected or known to be war crimes witnesses, in his
    opinion, would face very severe consequences on return.

152. He had not directed his  research  towards  the  position  of  returned
    asylum seekers.  His understanding was that the GOSL regarded  them  as
    economic migrants.  He referred to a letter from Bishop of  Mannar,  Dr
    Rayappu Joseph, who had appealed to the Australian authorities to  stop
    deportation of Sri Lankan Tamils.  Excerpts  of  his  letter  had  been
    published in the Sydney Herald and the Age, both mainstream  Australian
    publications.

      "...It is common knowledge that  those  deported  back  after  seeking
      political asylum abroad are left to live in fear  and  fright  due  to
      being considered traitors by the Government and its armed Forces. Some
      of them are being forced to become informants creating tension in  the
      communities. They  all  are  meted  out  with  restrictions,  threats,
      intimidation,  questionings,   surveillance   and   other   forms   of
      harassments  and  discrimination  by  the  Military,  Police  and  the
      intelligence officers. ...Thus, it is my considered opinion that it is
      highly dangerous for the asylum seekers from the North and East of Sri
      Lanka in Australia to be sent back to  Sri  Lanka  in  the  prevailing
      political situation in our regions. ..."[13]

    Since publishing this appeal, and publicly embarrassing the  GOSL,  the
    Bishop had been questioned three times by the security forces.

153. The witness' evidence  repeated  that  of  other  witnesses  about  the
    disproportionate  military  build-up  in  the  Northern   and   Eastern
    Provinces, having regard to the low  risk  of  resurgence  by  the  Sri
    Lankan LTTE, and the army  occupation  of  land,  together  with  HSZs,
    preventing tens of thousands of Tamils from resettling.

154. Dr Nadarajah explained the pressures on media sources, over  and  above
    self-censorship:   media  proprietors  interfered  in  media   content,
    particularly  in  non-State  media,  which   depended   on   government
    advertising for revenue;  the  Sinhalese  media  contained  nationalist
    sentiments, backed by incentives and State coercion.   The  authorities
    restricted the internet  and  mobile  devices,  blocking  websites  and
    monitoring both telephone and electronic communication.

155. There was no systematic monitoring of human  rights  abuses.   The  Sri
    Lankan Human Rights Commission had been revived in 2011 but its members
    were all political appointees and he considered its impartiality to  be
    'demonstrably suspect'.

156. In his oral evidence, Dr Nadarajah explained  'Pongu  Thamil'[14],  the
    series of uprisings in 1999 and during the peace  process  era.   Pongu
    Thamil had been a broad social movement, similar to  the  intifada,  in
    support of Tamil separatism.  The GOSL regarded all  the  Pongu  Thamil
    activists, particularly  student  activists,  as  Tamil  Tigers  and  a
    significant number of them, especially students, had been liquidated in
    "white van" killings during the shadow war  from  2005-2007.  The  GOSL
    remained sensitive to the activities  of  Jaffna  University  students;
    Jaffna University was the source of junior LTTE cadres during the civil
    war and a bellwether for the social situation and the  level  of  Tamil
    unrest generally.

157. 'Pongu Thamil' would never return;  the  channel  of  protest  now  was
    online petitions, although occasionally Tamils took to  the  street  to
    mark  particular  occasions.   The  other  significant   occasion   was
    Mahaveera[15], celebrated on 18 May in  every  year  since  2009.   The
    Tamil community came together for Mahaveera; it was an  opportunity  to
    recognise and honour the families of heroes who had not  returned,  and
    who might be buried unmarked in heroes'  graves,  or  never  have  been
    found at all.  Mahaveera was a  day  of  mourning  and  defiance,  with
    particular resonance for the May 2009 deaths at Mullaitivu in the NFZs.

158. The  arrested  Jaffna  students  in  December  2012  had  been  marking
    Maaveerar Naal on November 27[16].  Several dozen of them  conducted  a
    candlelit vigil.  Hundreds of others demonstrated.  A large  number  of
    students were arrested and released  later  with  no  accounts  of  ill
    treatment.  The university was closed down,  with  students  boycotting
    lectures.  In  addition,  120  Jaffna  University  lecturers  signed  a
    petition for the remaining students to be released.  The  arrest  of  a
    smaller number of students would discourage the remaining students  and
    their parents; the students had been transferred elsewhere and  it  was
    known that previously, arrested students had been beaten and tortured.

159. Large numbers of  Tamils  were  returning  to  Sri  Lanka;  those  with
    British passports could do so with more confidence since there  was  at
    least some oversight by the BHC.  He considered the  GOSL's  invitation
    to Tamils to return and help rebuild Sri Lanka was a publicity exercise
    for the international community.

160. Those with Sri Lankan or no documents were in  more  difficulty.   They
    were seen to be a threat to the GOSL and the Sri Lankan authorities and
    the GOSL was  seeking  to  "defeat  the  diaspora",  which  had  become
    increasingly active, particularly in London.

161. The Sri Lankan authorities and the GOSL  were  concerned  to  deny  and
    restrict evidence which could be used in war crimes trials abroad.   In
    2007, five students in Trincomalee  (the  Trincomalee  Five)  had  been
    executed.  There were proceedings in the United States issued in  2009,
    he thought, in relation to the Trincomalee Five.  A journalist who took
    photographs of that incident had been killed. In 2006, 16 international
    aid  workers  had  been  killed,  the  second  largest  such   incident
    worldwide.  Extensive claims had been documented from 2002  onwards  by
    ceasefire monitors, and  in  addition,  avoiding  a  war  crimes  trial
    relating to the thousands of deaths in the No-Fire Zone in May 2009 was
    a subject of intense concern to the  GOSL.   If  there  were  to  be  a
    successful prosecution, more claims would emerge.  He  considered  that
    there was a risk to those who were even suspected of having evidence of
    events between January and May 2009.

162. Dr Nadarajah had not been to Sri Lanka since 2003.  His research  began
    that year; he had  to  be  careful  as  some  of  those  with  whom  he
    corresponded had  died  subsequently.   He  received  information  over
    Skype, telephone calls, and by awaiting the arrival of journalists from
    Sri Lanka who would speak to him in  confidence.    Hotmail  and  Gmail
    email  accounts  and  telephone  calls  (mobile  and   ordinary)   were
    monitored, as were others; websites were randomly taken down; Skype was
    considered to be relatively safer.  He had to wait for his contacts  to
    get in touch, or use  separate  email  addresses  and  coded  language.
    Computers could be traced where Hotmail was used. Mobile phones and the
    internet were  not  readily  available  in  the  Northern  and  Eastern
    Provinces; in Colombo they were available but were very expensive,  and
    he considered that the providers had to keep in the 'good books' of the
    GOSL.  There were internet cafes in both Jaffna and Colombo.

163. He considered that figures for the Tamil population  within  Sri  Lanka
    were overstated, since many of those in the old textbooks which  formed
    the basis of the present figures were now in  the  diaspora.   He  gave
    figures for the number of Tamils in various places in the diaspora:

164. Dr Nadarajah told us that he had a  conversation  with  a  very  senior
    defence correspondent at the end of the 1990s, in Sri Lanka,  who  said
    that United States military intelligence were about  o  help  the  GOSL
    upgrade its surveillance capability; he considered that the opening  of
    the American Center in Colombo by  an  important  Sri  Lankan  military
    commander indicated that the relationship was close.

Submissions

165. We received extensive written  and  oral  argument  from  all  parties,
    before, during and after the hearing of  these  appeals.   We  mean  no
    disrespect to the parties in not setting  them  out  in  full  in  this
    determination.  The following  is  a  summary  of  the  country  points
    arising out of the closing submissions, when all the evidence had  been
    heard and was before the Tribunal.

A.    Respondent's submissions

166. The respondent's case at the beginning of the hearing was that  changes
    in Sri Lanka after 2009 were broadly positive and that Sri Lanka  could
    now be regarded as safe for most Tamils to return. Mr  Hall  relied  in
    particular on the decision of the European Court  of  Human  Rights  in
    E.G. v. The United Kingdom - 41178/08 [2011] ECHR 846.

167. Having heard  the  evidence,  in  his  closing  submissions,  oral  and
    written, Mr Hall accepted that  the  country  guidance  would  have  to
    change.   He  also  accepted  a  number  of  points  as   having   been
    established.  We consider that he was right to do so, on  the  evidence
    now before us.  Where relevant, the concessions he made  have  informed
    the country guidance we give, but that guidance is based on all of  the
    evidence and argument, written and oral, before us.

168. Mr Hall accepted that individuals in custody in Sri Lanka  continue  to
    be at risk of physical abuse, including sexual violence, and that  such
    risk is persecutory.  Evidence  before  the  Tribunal  confirmed  that,
    pursuant to an  amendment  to  the  Prevention  of  Terrorism  Act  (as
    amended) (PTA), the authorities could lawfully detain  individuals  for
    18 months without any judicial oversight or remedy.   The  11,000  LTTE
    cadres,   who   underwent   the   re-education   process    known    as
    "rehabilitation", were detained for at least two years, and some for as
    long as four years.  Mr Hall accepted that  there  appeared  to  be  no
    statutory underpinning for the rehabilitation process:  to  the  extent
    that "rehabilitation" was based on the detention  powers  in  the  PTA,
    even without any evidence of physical or sexual abuse, he accepted that
    detention  without  judicial  supervision  for  such  lengthy   periods
    amounted to persecution.

169. Mr Hall further accepted that forced returnees, whether  travelling  on
    a charter flight or scheduled flight, are asked for confirmation of the
    address to which they intend to proceed on  leaving  the  airport,  and
    must expect to be visited at that address by the police or the  CID  in
    the days following return, and if  of  interest,  may  be  detained  or
    revisited thereafter:  now that Sri  Lanka  had  achieved  the  unitary
    state,  with  the  GOSL  controlling  the  whole  territory,   internal
    relocation was not  an  option   for  those  in  whom  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities were interested, since their  whereabouts  were  known  and
    they could be traced easily.

170. He accepted that there were no detention facilities at the airport  and
    that, given the prevalence of bribery  and  corruption  in  Sri  Lanka,
    having left Sri Lanka without difficulty was not probative of a lack of
    adverse interest in an individual.  On return,  the  computers  at  the
    airport hold two lists: a "stop" list, comprising names  and  bio  data
    details of individuals against whom there is either a court order or an
    outstanding  arrest  warrant;  and  a  "watch"  list  of  those   whose
    activities the authorities wish to monitor.  Those on  a  "watch"  list
    are not reasonably likely to be  detained  at  the  airport.   However,
    those whose names are on a "stop" list will be stopped at  the  airport
    and passed to the relevant security  service  in  accordance  with  the
    order or warrant.

171. Mr Hall noted that, having regard to Mrs  Athi-Parkin's  statement,  it
    had been established that during 2011-2012, the respondent had  granted
    asylum to a number of (mainly student) returnees  with  multiple  entry
    visas who had been tortured on return to Sri Lanka, some  of  whom  had
    scars.

172. The respondent continued to rely upon her OGN of April 2012 and on  her
    policy documents in October and December 2012.   Only  13  examples  of
    persons with the "recent returnees" profile had been disclosed from the
    respondent's own records, of whom two had returned voluntarily  to  Sri
    Lanka, two were Dublin II returnees, and  nine  had  been  compulsorily
    returned.  The compulsory returnees had been in Sri Lanka  for  periods
    between 22 months and just under 8 years after  being  returned  before
    coming back to the United Kingdom and claiming asylum,  such  that  the
    causal connection between their history in the United Kingdom  and  the
    difficulties they then experienced in Sri Lanka was not strong.

173. Overall, Mr Hall said that  between  60  and  90  examples  of  "recent
    returnee" asylum seekers had been disclosed  in  all  of  the  parties'
    materials. In the period between the end of the civil war in  2009  and
    December 2012, 6073 Sri  Lankans  had  claimed  asylum  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Neither the UNHCR in its December 2012  guidelines,  nor  the
    HRW evidence contended that the risk category  should  be  regarded  as
    "all Tamils".  It was curious that of  all  the  groups  with  multiple
    entry visas, such abuse was reported only by  students.   The  students
    themselves had not given evidence and the "recent returnee" data should
    be approached with caution.  He reminded the Tribunal of  the  evidence
    of Mr Wright:  in 2011, the BHC in Colombo had granted 20,168 visas for
    the United Kingdom, 5,058 of them for study (unfortunately, without any
    ethnic breakdown between  Tamil  and  Sinhalese  students).   On  FFT's
    evidence, only 24  students  had  come  to  harm.   It  was  not  being
    suggested that "Tamil students"  were  a  risk  category.   No  similar
    evidence from the diaspora in Toronto, Oslo or Paris was made available
    to the Tribunal.

174.  As  regards  the  TAG  and  HRW  evidence,  he  accepted  Ms  Pickup's
    annotations on Mr Hays' tabular analysis as an accurate summary of some
    information in those cases.  About one third of  the  tabular  analysis
    appeals had been heard without a representative for the respondent; her
    failure to pursue the appeals  further  carried  no  particular  weight
    since the findings relied on were findings of fact, and an  appeal  lay
    only on a point of law to the Upper Tribunal.

175. Nor was there any evidence to assist the Tribunal as to  the  treatment
    of those who were  not  detained.  Tamils  were  participating  in  the
    democratic process:  the UNHCR Guidelines (footnote 38)  recorded  that
    the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) had  won  a  number  of  local
    government seats in the 2010 election.

176. Turning to the risk  in  Colombo,  Mr  Hall  noted  that  Ms  Pettitt's
    research for FFT included a small number of people who she recorded  as
    having been picked up  in  Colombo.   Ms  Pettitt  had  not  asked  the
    question of others in the sample group (and some did not  wish  her  to
    disclose where they were picked up); her focus was on the harm, and not
    where it had been caused.  However, the Tribunal's  task  included  the
    assessment of differential risk as between Colombo and the Tamil  areas
    in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

177. Mr Hall submitted that the evidence  suggested  that  now,  four  years
    after the end of the civil  war,  the  risk  of  being  identified,  or
    perceived, as an enemy of the GOSL or the Rajapaksa regime was lower in
    Colombo, as opposed to the heavily militarised Northern Province.

178. There were relatively few checkpoints in Colombo now and, in Sri  Lanka
    as a whole, checkpoints were not yet computerised. Some of the examples
    given were of persons picked up at the Omanthai checkpoint in  Colombo.
    It was established that there were no computers at that checkpoint  and
    no explanation was  offered  as  to  how  those  individuals  had  been
    identified as of interest.  Absent  any  other  factor,  failed  asylum
    seekers would be at no greater risk than  anyone  else  at  an  offline
    checkpoint. There was no requirement  to  demonstrate  loyalty  to  the
    regime by singing nationalistic songs, as in Zimbabwe.

179. Dealing with rehabilitation, and noting that to  the  extent  to  which
    "rehabilitation" was really PTA detention, it would be persecutory,  Mr
    Hall said that the other processes such  as  monitoring,  surveillance,
    reporting  and  the  like,  after  the  initial  rehabilitation,   were
    processes which  took  place  in  many  western  democracies  and  were
    insufficiently adverse treatment to amount to  persecution  or  serious
    harm engaging the international protection Conventions.

B.    Appellants' submissions

180. The appellants divided the general country questions between  them  and
    their submissions were heard  in  inverse  order,  with  Mr  Mackenzie,
    representing the third appellant, leading, followed by Mr Spurling  and
    Mr Palmer. Ms Jegarajah's submissions for TAG were taken last.

(1)   Mr Mackenzie's submissions

181. Mr Mackenzie focused his submissions on  four  areas:   rehabilitation,
    risk in Colombo, internal relocation, and  returnees  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  He  submitted  that  there  was  no  established  or  durable
    improvement in conditions in Sri Lanka, four years on from the  end  of
    the civil war.  In some respects, the situation had deteriorated.   The
    Sri  Lankan  government  elected  in  2010  was  a  paranoid,  corrupt,
    chauvinist regime.  Risk today was not the same  as  in  2009;  it  now
    related not to  a  person's  past  history,  but  to  their  actual  or
    perceived association with the LTTE resurgence in the  diaspora.   Past
    actions would be regarded as strongly indicative of present sympathies,
    especially if an individual  was  returning  from  a  diaspora  hotspot
    (London, Toronto, Paris or Oslo).

182.  The  GOSL's  domestic  pronouncements,   and   its   continuing   high
    militarisation of the Tamil areas in the Northern Province, were  based
    on the express premise that it considered that the LTTE was capable  of
    returning to combat.  The respondent in her April 2012 OGN had accepted
    that the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  feared  LTTE  resurgence  and  were
    continuing  to  search  for  and  detain  persons  suspected  of  being
    sympathisers or operatives (3.6.2).

183. The GOSL had no concern at all for international opinion,  despite  its
    assertions to the  contrary.   The  recent  impeachment  of  the  Chief
    Justice, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, for her position on the  lawfulness
    of land grabs in the Northern Province had proceeded, undeterred by  an
    international outcry or the threat to re-site the CHOGM meeting due  to
    be held in Sri Lanka in autumn 2013.  The GOSL had repeatedly  lied  to
    the international community and had openly intimidated opponents at the
    CHOGM meeting in Perth Australia in 2011.  No weight should be given to
    the GOSL's assurances to the UN that the LLRC recommendations would  be
    fully implemented in Sri Lanka by May 2014.

184. President Rajapaksa had stated that  checkpoints  were  no  longer  the
    primary way in which LTTE sympathisers and cadres were identified.  His
    government  made  extensive  use  of  intelligence-led  security,  with
    informers  across  the  entire  country.   Its  pervasive  intelligence
    networks delivered reliable information as  to  who  were  former  LTTE
    cadres or involved, or linked to the LTTE  resurgence  efforts  in  the
    diaspora.  The networks functioned both  in  the  Tamil  areas  in  the
    Northern Province of Sri Lanka, and in  the  United  Kingdom.   If  the
    government had grounds for suspicion, whether from an appellant's  past
    or present history, that would be sufficient to create a real  risk  of
    persecution or serious harm.

185. It was submitted that the process of investigation of any suspected  or
    perceived links,  and  of  interrogation,  would  engage  international
    protection as the Sri Lankan government  was  known  to  use  arbitrary
    detention and torture. In addition, he argued, human rights abuses were
    also used by the GOSL as part of the process of  protecting  Sri  Lanka
    from any LTTE resurgence.  There was an intention  to  terrorise  those
    interrogated, with a view to demonstrating to  others  that  those  who
    'stepped out of line' would be tortured, within an inch of their lives,
    or even beyond.

186. The investigation process remained ethnocentric,  designed  to  exclude
    Tamils.  When a Tamil was asked to sign a document which he  could  not
    read, written in the  Sinhala  language,  it  was  unlikely  to  be  an
    unimportant or innocent document.  He  reminded  the  Tribunal  of  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in Selvaratnam v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 121.

187. The respondent should be held to the position taken  in  her  published
    OGN, which was the guidance used by caseworkers in  determining  asylum
    applications.  She had expressly adopted that as her statement of  case
    and the appellants therefore had not  produced  evidence  dealing  with
    matters which were in their favour in  that  document  and  which  were
    accepted therein.

188. The Tribunal should find that there was a risk on return for those  who
    had not been subject to the rehabilitation process; there was  a  plain
    risk that they would be required to do  so  on  return,  if  they  were
    thought to have LTTE sympathies.   He  reminded  the  Tribunal  of  the
    Jaffna  students  who,  following   the   publication   of   the   LLRC
    recommendations, had celebrated Maaveerar Naal (Heroes Day) in November
    2011 and been arrested and sent for rehabilitation.  Thousands of  LTTE
    members who had surrendered at the end of the civil war had  been  sent
    for rehabilitation and the same would happen to his client.

189. There  seemed  to  be  no  legal  underpinning  to  the  rehabilitation
    process; detention in the rehabilitation camps was  plainly  under  the
    PTA.  The process had no reasonable purpose (Senathirajah  Ravichandran
    v. Secretary of State for the  Home  Department [1995]  EWCA  Civ,  at
    paragraph 179).  The respondent's OGN at paragraph 3.9.12 accepted that
    there existed a risk of torture in the rehabilitation  camps  and  case
    owners were directed to consider a grant of asylum based  on  perceived
    political opinion  in  such  circumstances.  18  months'  detention  on
    suspicion in these circumstances was a plain  and  flagrant  breach  of
    Article 5 ECHR. The rehabilitation process had a strong, non-benign and
    persecutory element, well beyond any legitimate purpose.

190.  Post-rehabilitation  monitoring  of  former   LTTE   cadres   included
    restriction on internal  movement,  harassment,  and  strict  reporting
    conditions, all without any judicial  oversight.   Arguably,  the  huge
    scale of the project far outweighed the risk  of  any  LTTE  resurgence
    now.

191. Dealing next with Colombo, there was no reliable evidence  of  a  lower
    risk of being identified in Colombo as a person  of  interest  on  LTTE
    grounds. The respondent had accepted that internal relocation  was  not
    an option for those who had been identified as a risk  to  the  regime:
    it was also clear, as the Tribunal itself had noted, that  the  process
    leading to the issue of emergency or ETDs or TTDs to returnees  in  the
    United Kingdom meant that  the  authorities  in  Colombo  had  all  the
    information they required before a travel  document  was  issued.   The
    evidence also established that on return, they  would  be  asked  about
    links to the LTTE, and they could not be expected to lie about those.

192. Five of those on the tabular analysis had been picked up, detained  and
    tortured after being held at the airport for a relatively short period;
    eight had been picked up in Colombo and two  in  unspecified  locations
    shortly after leaving the airport (probably, therefore,  in  or  around
    Colombo).  The HRW sexual violence report identified at least 18 people
    who had been picked up in Colombo, six at the airport and twelve in the
    city.  Four of the twenty-four people in the FFT report had been picked
    up in Colombo itself.  Two  others  had  been  picked  up  between  the
    airport and Colombo.

193. The evidence did not support a finding  that  internal  relocation  was
    easier within Colombo, especially as the LTTE had a history of  suicide
    bombing in the capital.  The respondent's written  closing  submissions
    argued that internal relocation was easier in Colombo but Mr  Mackenzie
    reminded the Tribunal  that  in  his  oral  submissions,  Mr  Hall  had
    accepted that there was no internal relocation option if a person  were
    known or perceived to be associated with the resurgent LTTE.  The  same
    position was taken in the UNHCR guidelines of December 2012.

194. Significant numbers of decisions favourable to asylum seekers had  been
    disclosed by the parties and the  respondent,  more  specific  examples
    than had been available in any previous country guidance  case.   There
    was more than enough evidence to raise  serious  questions  as  to  the
    safety of return.  It was not open to the respondent to  seek  to  cast
    doubt on the fully researched and tested claims of abuse on  which  the
    appellants relied.  The  respondent  had  not  sought  to  produce  any
    evidence to the contrary effect and the evidence should be accepted  at
    face value.

195. Those, such as his client, who had been released after  the  ceasefire,
    were bound to be on record.  His client had been in the United  Kingdom
    in the meantime and had two brothers who were also of interest  to  the
    authorities.  He asked that the Tribunal allow  the  third  appellant's
    appeal.

(2)   Mr Spurling's submissions

196. Mr Spurling relied upon, and adopted, his written submissions  as  well
    as those of TAG and the other appellants, and the oral  submissions  of
    Mr Mackenzie, with the following differences and additions.  Unlike the
    other appellants, he encouraged the Tribunal to  continue  to  approach
    assessment of risk primarily by the use of risk  factors,  rather  than
    the broader approach which we have adopted in this  determination.   Mr
    Spurling submitted that the "risk factors"' approach was  a  tried  and
    tested method and would assist the First-tier Tribunals. The  existence
    in a particular case of one or more of the risk factors should never be
    regarded as determinative, but their presence elevated the risk  to  an
    individual, with each case being  decided  on  its  particular  factual
    matrix.

197. The continuing heavy occupation of the Tamil areas, in  particular  the
    Northern Province, was inconsistent with  more  benign  objectives  and
    with the findings of the LLRC.  The respondent's  Operational  Guidance
    Note accepted that the GOSL still engaged in torture, and had alliances
    with violent militias.  The evidence before the Tribunal was  that  the
    government used  spies  and  intelligence  extensively,  and  that  its
    response to any expression of Tamil  identity  (such  as  that  of  the
    Jaffna students) was harsh.  The Tribunal should  not  seek  or  expect
    rational behaviour from the Sri Lankan state, as persecution was by its
    nature irrational.

198. The target of the GOSL's malignity was  Tamil  opposition  groups,  the
    community of Tamil separatists, and was directed those  with  roots  in
    the Northern Province and throughout  the  diaspora.  The  existing  LP
    factor (viii), those who were returned from London, should  be  amended
    to read  "London  or  other  centre  of  diaspora  opposition".   Three
    additional factors should be identified:

         i)  having been an actual or potential witness of war crimes in the
            Eastern No-Fire Zone at the end of the civil war in May 2009;

        ii)  being a candidate for,  or  having  been  subject  to  post-war
            screening and/or  rehabilitation,  whether  a  person  had  been
            rehabilitated,  spent  time   in   the   camps   without   being
            rehabilitated, or not been in the  camps  at  all.   This  group
            would encompass all Tamils from the  Vanni  who  had  ever  been
            associated with the LTTE at any level or had lived in  any  area
            under LTTE control;

       iii)  being perceived as hostile to the Rajapaksa Government  or  the
            Sri Lankan state.

Mr Spurling accepted that the extent  to  which  the  proposed  new  factors
    elevated the risk for a particular appellant would always be a question
    of fact.

199. Additionally, Mr Spurling asked the Tribunal to find that there  was  a
    particular risk to journalists critical of the government and its human
    rights record, although none of the present appellants fall  into  that
    category.  As already stated, Mr Hall for the respondent,  agrees  that
    there is an elevated risk to journalists.

200. Mr Spurling accepted that the evidence the second appellant  had  given
    before the Upper Tribunal as to which camp he was in when he  signed  a
    document in the Sinhala language, had been different from that  in  his
    witness statement.  His original account  was  that  he  signed  it  at
    Anuradhapura, a military detention facility under the PTA.  The  events
    in question were a long time ago and  the  appellant  had  undergone  a
    number of stressful events since then.  Any submission as  to  what  he
    signed and where was  necessarily  speculative,  but  the  document  he
    signed was unlikely to have been a benign document, and  on  any  view,
    its existence would elevate the appellant's presence in the records and
    the likelihood of his being on a relevant database.

201. The second appellant had spent three months and 10  days  in  detention
    and it would be surprising if no record existed of that detention.  His
    release from detention had cost an enormous  amount  (32  Lakh  rupees,
    equivalent to �16,670 at the date of hearing before us).  His  paternal
    uncle had a shoe business and had been able to arrange the payment; the
    appellant and his own family were not  wealthy.  Evidence  produced  on
    behalf of the appellants indicated that the average household income in
    Sri Lanka was Rupees 3,500 a month, so that the bribe paid amounted  to
    over seven years' average income.  It was a huge sum and indicated that
    getting him out of detention had been extremely difficult.

202. The second appellant had never held a passport and would be obliged  to
    return on a TTD. His departure from Sri Lanka was also  irregular.   Mr
    Spurling reminded us of the Mr Lewis' evidence as  to  the  information
    required by the Sri Lankan authorities in Colombo before a TTD would be
    issued under the Bilateral Readmission Agreement. If  returned  to  Sri
    Lanka, the Tribunal should assume that the second appellant would  tell
    the truth about his past if asked.

(3)   Mr Palmer's submissions

203. For the first appellant, Mr  Palmer  reminded  us  that  the  grant  of
    permission had preserved the findings that  the  appellant  had  indeed
    been detained and tortured.  In the alternative,  the  Tribunal  should
    consider his evidence de novo.  The grant of permission had been on all
    grounds and the Secretary of State had not opposed  the  basis  of  the
    grant.

204. The First-tier Tribunal Judge had accepted the  medical  evidence  that
    the appellant had been tortured.  The witness, Mr Manivannon, knew  the
    first appellant's sister, and had been able to confirm  both  that  she
    was high up in the LTTE's medical wing and that she  was  a  member  of
    Prabhakaran's personal medical team.  Unfortunately,  as  he  had  been
    unable  to  present  himself  for  cross-examination,  Mr  Manivannon's
    evidence was not tested.  Mr Manivannon had been available on the first
    day of the hearing and had been found credible in his account of  being
    an LTTE member given in his own appeal.

205. The first appellant was a war crimes witness:  Mr Palmer relied on  the
    evidence and on the arguments of Mr Mackenzie and Mr Spurling about war
    crimes witnesses.  Professor Gunaratna's opinion,  that  the  appellant
    had been a member of the LTTE carrying out  financial  duties,  was  an
    unambiguous opinion from a person with the expertise to give  it.   The
    Tribunal should so find.  The addition, in the first  appellant's  oral
    evidence to us, of an allegation that he was on a  wanted  list  to  be
    shot was not surprising and there remained a credible Chiver core which
    should be accepted.  His evidence was credible overall.

206. With the support of  Ms  Jegarajah,  who  represented  both  the  first
    appellant and TAG, Mr Palmer invited us to be pragmatic in our approach
    and to focus on which of the First-tier Tribunal findings were infected
    by the material error of law identified in  the  grant  of  permission.
    The first appellant's appeal should be allowed.

C.    Miss Jegarajah's submissions

207. In her role as representative of TAG, Miss Jegarajah  argued  that  the
    mindset of the Sri Lankan government was that there should be  one  Sri
    Lankan  state,  one  nation,  and  one  religion.   The  approach   was
    monolithic, with any threat from anyone with anti-state views,  whether
    political, military, or as part  of  a  collective  organisation  being
    dealt  with  severely.   The  Sri   Lankan   government   worked   with
    paramilitary groups who formed a real part of the GOSL's operations  in
    the Northern  Province.   There  was  a  dual  process  of  governance,
    underpinned by the so-called "white van" phenomenon.   It  was  in  the
    interests of the Rajapaksa government to say that the LTTE  remained  a
    threat,  since  its  existing  security  activity   was   fundamentally
    unconstitutional, from  the  PTA  to  the  Emergency  Regulations  (now
    lapsed, but effectively included in the amended PTA), and having regard
    to the intense militarisation which had occurred since the civil war.

208. Miss Jegarajah argued that the intention of the GOSL was not really  to
    prevent the resurgence of the LTTE but to treat the Tamil community  so
    harshly that it could not and would not reorganise and would  therefore
    constitute no ongoing threat to the Sri Lankan state.  She relied  upon
    the post-mortem statement in January 2009  of  Lasantha  Wickrematunge,
    the late Editor of the Sunday Leader.  His paper,  the  Sunday  Leader,
    had been particularly critical of President  Rajapaksa.   Wickrematunge
    had been receiving death threats for some time, before  being  shot  by
    four armed motorcyclists on his way to work on 8 January 2009; he  died
    of his injuries in hospital.

209. In an editorial which Wickrematunge  had  written  shortly  before  his
    death, which was published posthumously, he stated, "When finally I  am
    killed, it will be the government that kills  me".   He  expressed  his
    repugnance for the LTTE:

       "Neither should our distaste for the civil  war  be  interpreted  to
       mean that we support the Tamil Tigers. The LTTE is  among  the  most
       ruthless and bloodthirsty organisations to have infested the planet.
       There is no gainsaying that it must be eradicated. But to do  so  by
       violating  the  rights  of  Tamil  citizens,  bombing  and  shooting
       mercilessly, is not only wrong but shames the Sinhalese, whose claim
       to be custodians of the dhamma is for ever called into  question  by
       this savagery -  much  of  it  unknown  to  the  public  because  of
       censorship."

210. In the same article, Wickrematunge addressed his old  friend  President
    Rajapaksa directly:

       "Mahinda, when you finally fought your way to the Sri Lanka  Freedom
       party presidential nomination in 2005,  nowhere  were  you  welcomed
       more warmly than in this column. Indeed, we broke with a  decade  of
       tradition by referring to you throughout by your first name. So well
       known were your commitments to human rights and liberal values  that
       we ushered you in like a breath of fresh air. ...

       In the wake of  my  death  I  know  you  will  make  all  the  usual
       sanctimonious noises and call upon the police to hold  a  swift  and
       thorough inquiry.

       But like all the inquiries you have ordered  in  the  past,  nothing
       will come of this one, too. For truth be told, we both know who will
       be behind my death, but dare not call his name. Not just my life but
       yours too depends on it.

       As for me, I have the satisfaction of knowing that I walked tall and
       bowed to no man. And I have not travelled this journey alone. Fellow
       journalists in other branches of the media walked with me: most  are
       now dead, imprisoned without  trial  or  exiled  in  far-off  lands.
       Others walk in the shadow of death that your presidency has cast  on
       the freedoms for which you once fought so hard. You  will  never  be
       allowed to forget that my death took  place  under  your  watch.  As
       anguished as I know you will be, I also know that you will  have  no
       choice but to protect my killers: you will see to it that the guilty
       one is never convicted. You have no choice."

211. It was TAG's position that all failed Sri Lankan  asylum  seekers  were
    at risk on return.   The  Tribunal  should  not  forget  the  May  2009
    genocide when looking at the risk of persecution or serious harm today:
    the risk was greater than it had been, due  to  the  ongoing  political
    controversy.  Anything up  to  100,000  Tamils  had  been  deliberately
    herded into the No-Fire Zones between January and  May  2009,  and  had
    died or been killed there.  The international community  had  taken  no
    action regarding  the  impeachment  in  January  2013  of  Dr.  Shirani
    Bandaranayake, the Chief Justice, and the Sri Lankan government knew it
    could act as it pleased internally.

212. The Tribunal should ask itself what it meant to be a Sri  Lankan  Tamil
    now.  Any implied support for a two  state  solution  or  for  regional
    autonomy was regarded as a threat by the  Sri  Lankan  government.  All
    Tamils believed in a Tamil homeland, in Tamil pride, with  events  such
    as Mahaveera and Pongu Thamil being an  opportunity  to  express  their
    solidarity and their desire for a Tamil homeland.  The  United  Kingdom
    was where the alternative war was being waged,  since  no  protest  was
    permitted in Sri Lanka.  The United Kingdom Tamil  community  was  very
    articulate  and  politically  aware.  She  reminded  us  that  when  Ms
    Jananayagam had stood in a recent European election as  an  independent
    candidate on a Tamil separatist platform, she had received 50,000 votes
    from United Kingdom-based Tamils.

213. In London, the Tamil  community  ensured  that  the  genocide  was  not
    forgotten; there was safety in living and protesting together.  On  his
    arrival at Heathrow for the Olympics in 2012, President  Rajapaksa  had
    been faced with criminal proceedings in Bow Street Magistrates'  Court,
    demonstrations of thousands outside his residence at the Dorchester and
    had been turned back from his planned visit  to  the  Oxford  Union  on
    security grounds.

214. The Sri Lankan government was aware  that  all  Tamils  living  in  the
    United Kingdom were part of a collective organisation which  maintained
    a sustained opposition to the  Rajapaksa  government.   Any  Tamil  who
    claimed asylum abroad was therefore an opponent  in  the  eyes  of  the
    GOSL, one of those trying to revive the internal  armed  conflict,  and
    was at risk by reason of their perceived political opinion. It was  not
    a question of extent; anyone who wanted  Tamil  self-governance  simply
    could not return to Sri Lanka, and in particular, those who  wished  to
    express views about war crimes or a separate Tamil state were bound  to
    face persecution.

215.  Those  who  were  war  crimes   witnesses,   including   everyone   in
    Mullaivaikkal at the end of the civil war, were members of a particular
    social group and at risk for that reason alone.  She asked us  to  look
    at the International Crisis Group's latest  report.   The  government's
    express intent was to investigate and protect witnesses or  war  crimes
    but prosecution  could,  and  should,  go  back  years  as  it  had  in
    Yugoslavia and Rwanda; members of the present government  had  much  to
    fear.

216. The respondent had not taken the opportunity available to  her  to  put
    in evidence of determinations in her favour.  She was  fixed  with  the
    deficiencies of how she had chosen to present her case.

217. There were multiple stages when an appellant might  come  into  contact
    with the  authorities.   The  respondent's  Operational  Guidance  Note
    established (paragraphs 3.16-3.19) that before a  travel  document  was
    issued, and during intelligence collection at the  airport  on  return,
    charter flight returnees would be asked who they were, who their people
    were, what was their permanent address in Sri Lanka and the whereabouts
    of their papers.  They were expected to  give,  and  reside  at,  their
    permanent address as shown on the national identity card.  Support from
    the  UNHCR  was  sometimes  available  at   the   airport   but   UNHCR
    representatives, like BHC MDOs and MSOs, were not permitted to  sit  in
    on the interviews.

218. Ms Jegarajah could not point to any evidence before the Tribunal as  to
    the size of the transitory Tamil population in  Colombo,  living  there
    clandestinely or in lodges, as opposed to the integrated  urban  Tamils
    there, who would be Sinhala-speaking.  Staying in Colombo was  not  the
    authorities' expectation; however, only in Colombo was  the  assistance
    of IOM or UNHCR available.

219. It was much easier to understand what was  happening  in  the  Northern
    Province, since there was a much richer  examination  in  the  material
    before the Tribunal of what was going on there.  The GOSL's questioning
    of all Tamils from the Northern and Eastern  Provinces  was  geared  to
    control, supervision and  monitoring  of  the  Tamil  population.   The
    authorities wanted to know about the LTTE in London and would ask about
    that, either in London or in Sri Lanka.  It was now trite law  that  an
    appellant could not be expected to lie.

220. Although the British authorities did not monitor  what  happened  after
    the airport, there had been some limited monitoring of  returnees  from
    India, as set  out  in  the  UNHCR  report.   The  monitoring  was  not
    systematic, but Ms Jegarajah submitted that it showed  that  the  UNCHR
    was not allowed to sit in on airport interviews, that 75% were  visited
    by the Sri Lankan authorities at their  registered  address;  and  that
    there was a great deal of arbitrary arrest, detention and torture.

221. The UNHCR report showed that former  membership  of  the  LTTE  at  any
    level was  determinative  (page  27),  including  anyone  who  provided
    support.   Ravichandran  had  established  that   repeated   short-term
    roundups and detentions could amount to persecution.  Second-tier human
    rights could no longer be the subject of any derogation now  Sri  Lanka
    was not at war, but there was a cold war going on,  with  human  rights
    breaches every day in the Northern Province.  She relied on  paragraphs
    63-65 of Sepet & Anor  v Secretary Of State For Home Department  [2001]
    EWCA Civ 681:

        "63.     There are some classes of case  in  which  the  threatened
        conduct is of such a kind that  it  is  universally  condemned,  by
        national and international law, and always constitutes persecution:
        torture, rape (though of course it is not  necessarily  persecution
        for a Convention reason). In those instances, the question  whether
        or not there is persecution is straightforwardly a matter of  fact.
        ...There are other classes of case in which the threatened  conduct
        is by no means  necessarily  unjustified  at  the  bar  of  law  or
        opinion: imprisonment is a plain instance (where its length is  not
        disproportionate and its conditions are not barbarous). In  such  a
        case some further factor is  required  to  turn  the  treatment  in
        question  into  persecution.  Torture  is  absolutely  persecutory;
        imprisonment only conditionally so.

        64.      What is the further factor that may turn imprisonment into
        persecution? It can only be that  the  claimant  is  liable  to  be
        imprisoned for a Convention reason. There can be no other way in to
        the regime of  Convention  protection.  In  this  case,  then,  the
        existence of a Convention reason is what defines the  treatment  as
        persecutory.

        65.      See where this leads. The putative act  of  persecution  -
        imprisonment - is only such if it is  inflicted  for  a  Convention
        reason. (I leave aside all the  uncontentious  possibilities:  that
        the  military  service  involves  acts  or  conditions  which   are
        barbarous, or that the punishment for draft evasion is barbarous or
        disproportionate). It is the why and wherefore of the  punishment's
        infliction that alone can transform the imprisonment suffered  into
        persecution. But then it must constitute persecution  according  to
        the Convention's common  standard,  within  and  according  to  the
        autonomous international meaning of the Convention."

222. The identification of risk factors and/or categories was unhelpful  and
    a 'massive obstacle to fairness' in asylum proceedings.  The risk could
    be caused by any number of factors combined.  Miss Jegarajah  asked  us
    to set the risk category as "all Tamils".

Submissions in reply

223. In additional submissions, Mr Hall said that the evidence in the  March
    2012 Country of Origin Report  on  Sri  Lanka  was  that  there  was  a
    population of over 2 million people in Colombo, of  whom  about  250000
    were Tamils, including about 25000 Indian Tamils.

224. He asked the Tribunal to  read  the  whole  of  the  judgment  of  Lord
    Justice Simon Brown in Sepet & Anor v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2001] EWCA Civ 681 (Sepet and Bulbul) and to  look  at  the
    decision in the round.  Ms Pickup commented that Sepet and Bulbul dealt
    with the persecutory risk from detention as part of a judicial  process
    for draft evasion, rather than, as here, detention without any judicial
    oversight at all.  The fact set in  Ravichandran  was  also  different:
    that case  dealt  with  repeated,  short-term  emergency  roundups  and
    detentions, unlike the prolonged unsupervised detention here for up  to
    2 years.  Grahl Madsen had stated that three months  detention  without
    judicial  oversight  was  persecutory.   Mr  Mackenzie  also  took  the
    Tribunal to evidence showing that the detention  for  the  purposes  of
    rehabilitation was typically for a two-year  period,  without  judicial
    oversight.

225. Mr Spurling indicated that he relied on Professor  Gunaratna's  report,
    and on what occurred in detention, rather than the detention itself, to
    establish risk.

226. We reserved our decision, which we now give.


Legal framework

227. We remind ourselves that the persecution or risk of harm  here  alleged
    is from either emanations of the  Sri  Lankan  state,  or  paramilitary
    organisations said to be cooperating with the GOSL.  Sri  Lanka  is  no
    longer a divided state and in such cases, the respondent  accepts  that
    internal relocation is not an option because the  risk  extends  across
    the whole country.

228. The Tribunal's decisions in TK and LP identified  twelve  risk  factors
    in the civil wartime period: a previous record as a suspected or actual
    LTTE  member;  previous  criminal  record  and/or  outstanding   arrest
    warrant; bail jumping and/or escaping from  custody;  having  signed  a
    confession or similar document;  having  been  asked  by  the  security
    forces to become an informer; the presence  of  scarring;  return  from
    London or other centre of LTTE fundraising; illegal departure from  Sri
    Lanka; lack of an ID card or other documentation; having made an asylum
    claim abroad; and having relatives in the LTTE.

229. The judicial head note in  LP  emphasised  that  each  case  should  be
    considered on its own facts, rather than treating the twelve factors as
    a "check list".  We consider that fact-based assessment continues to be
    the proper approach, and that it is time to reassess the risks overall.



230. At point (7) of the LP guidance, the Tribunal considered  how  a  fact-
    finder should approach expert evidence:

        (7) The weight to  be  given  to  expert  evidence  (individual  or
        country) and country background  evidence  is  dependent  upon  the
        quality of the raw data from which it is drawn and the  quality  of
        the filtering process  to  which  that  data  has  been  subjected.
        Sources should be given whenever possible."

231. In NA v United Kingdom - 25904/07 [2011] ECHR 1272, the European  Court
    of Human Rights expressly approved  that  approach  and  gave  guidance
    regarding the approach  to  country  evidence  ('objective  evidence'),
    saying this:

       "120. In assessing such material, consideration must be given to its
       source, in particular its independence, reliability and objectivity.
       In respect of reports, the authority and reputation of  the  author,
       the seriousness of the investigations by means of  which  they  were
       compiled,  the  consistency   of   their   conclusions   and   their
       corroboration by other sources are all relevant considerations  (see
       Saadi v. Italy, cited above, � 143).

       121. The Court also recognises that consideration must be  given  to
       the presence and reporting capacities of the author of the  material
       in the country in question. In this respect, the Court observes that
       States (whether the respondent State in a  particular  case  or  any
       other  Contracting  or   non-Contracting   State),   through   their
       diplomatic missions and their ability to  gather  information,  will
       often be able to provide material which may be  highly  relevant  to
       the Court's assessment of the case before it.  It  finds  that  same
       consideration must apply, a fortiori, in respect of agencies of  the
       United Nations,  particularly  given  their  direct  access  to  the
       authorities of the country of destination as well as  their  ability
       to carry out on-site inspections and assessments in a  manner  which
       States and non-governmental organisations may not be able to do.

       122. While the Court accepts that many reports are,  by  their  very
       nature, general assessments, greater importance must necessarily  be
       attached to reports which consider the human rights situation in the
       country of destination and directly  address  the  grounds  for  the
       alleged real risk of ill-treatment in the  case  before  the  Court.
       ..."

232. In TK, the AIT considered the LP guidance, which it approved  as  still
    valid, adding that :


       "...b)  Events since the military defeat of the  LTTE  in  May  2009
       have  not  aggravated  the  likely  approach  of  the   Sri   Lankan
       authorities to returned failed asylum seekers  who  are  Tamils;  if
       anything the level of interest in them has decreased. The  principal
       focus of the authorities  continues  to  be,  not  Tamils  from  the
       Northern Province (or east) as such, but persons  considered  to  be
       either LTTE members, fighters or  operatives  or  persons  who  have
       played an active  role  in  the  international  procurement  network
       responsible for financing the LTTE and ensuring it was supplied with
       arms.


       c)  The records the Sri Lanka authorities keep on persons with  some
       history  of  arrest   and   detention   have   become   increasingly
       sophisticated;  their  greater  accuracy   is   likely   to   reduce
       substantially the risk that a person of  no  real  interest  to  the
       authorities would be arrested or detained..."

233. In E.G. v. The United Kingdom - 41178/08 [2011] ECHR 846  the  European
    Court of Human Rights held that return on a TTD did not  seem  to  make
    any difference to the risk at the airport, which it considered too  low
    to engage international protection.  The facts before the Court in E.G.
    arose from a Tamil last detained in 1996, who had not left  the  United
    Kingdom since 2000.  No evidence more recent than 2010 as to conditions
    in Sri Lanka was before the Court.

234. On 27 February 2013, in PK, II, TK, AK,  KI  and  MBF  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1064 (Admin),  Wilkie  J  and
    UTJ Gleeson sitting jointly as a panel of the Upper Tribunal in respect
    of two claims, with Wilkie J sitting alone on another four claims which
    were not suitable for the Upper Tribunal, considered  the  respondent's
    decision to proceed  to  remove  by  charter  flight  approximately  90
    individuals to Sri Lanka. The charter flight had been arranged  for  28
    February 2013, with the arrangements  having  begun  in  early  January
    2013.  In two cases, the defendant had already agreed to defer removal.
     Of the remaining four, two had been transferred to the Upper  Tribunal
    and two were retained in the High Court.  The material passages are  at
    paragraphs 16-19 of the judgment of Wilkie J:

      "16.  In addition, at paragraph 71 [of SG Iraq v SSHD 2012  EWCA  940,
          Stanley Burnton LJ] endorsed the test which had  been  formulated
          at first  instance  by  Irwin  J,  which  he  summarised  in  the
          following terms:


           "The court should not stay removal pending the decision  of  the
           Court of Appeal, unless the claimant has  adduced  a  clear  and
           coherent volume of evidence that the findings  of  the  Tribunal
           were in error."


      17.   Mr Hall seeks to rely on this passage as authoritative  for  the
          proposition that this court should not grant the  interim  relief
          sought, on the ground relied on by a large number  of  applicants
          and potential applicants,  namely  that  the  decision  to  issue
          removal directions through the means of this charter  flight  was
          arguably wrong in principle, or irrational, on the  grounds  that
          there was presently part heard a country guidance case which  was
          likely to be determined within a few weeks, and was highly likely
          to change the existing country guidance.  What is said is that it
          would be wrong to grant  such  relief  without  descending  to  a
          particular consideration of the facts of each and every case,  so
          as to see whether the claimant had produced a clear and  coherent
          body of evidence, that the conclusion of the Secretary  of  State
          in refusing a fresh claim was or would be in error in  the  light
          of the emerging country guidance.


      18.   In my judgment, the situation which is presented  to  the  court
          today is virtually unique.  It arises from  the  very  particular
          circumstances of the timing  of  the  decision  to  remove  these
          claimants by a charter flight, at the very time that the UTIAC is
          actively seised with considering new country guidance.  At a time
          when it is clear from the agenda that the  UTIAC  is  considering
          the matter virtually afresh, and where  it  is  accepted  by  the
          Secretary of State through the preliminary  closing  submissions,
          that the existing country guidance cases  will  have  to  change.
          That position is one which this court  cannot  blind  itself  to.
          The UTIAC has, I am told, received a  huge  amount  of  evidence,
          much of it, I  have  no  doubt,  clear  and  coherent,  certainly
          sufficient to persuade the Secretary of State in her  preliminary
          closing submissions to accept that the existing country  guidance
          has to change.


      19.   In my judgment, it does not go against the decision of the Court
          of Appeal in SG for this court on this occasion to consider  that
          this may be an appropriate case for granting interim  relief,  to
          prevent the Secretary of State carrying into effect a decision to
          remove persons who are to be removed on this charter flight, when
          that decision was taken in the knowledge and at the same time  as
          the UTIAC was actively considering changing the country  guidance
          given in case law, and when the agenda was as far reaching as  it
          is, and the position of the Secretary of State in the face of the
          body  evidence,  has  been  to  accept  that   some   change   is
          inevitable."


235. A generic stay was granted for  all  failed  asylum  seekers  from  Sri
    Lanka, pending the guidance to be given in the present decision.


Discussion

Our assessment of the witnesses

236. Starting with the UKBA evidence, we consider that the  evidence  of  Mr
    Lewis is useful for the light it throws on the  practicalities  of  the
    process of return, particularly as he was responsible for almost all of
    the summary letters written on behalf  of  the  BHC  in  Colombo  after
    charter flights to Sri Lanka.  Mr Lewis' evidence was based on his  own
    knowledge and on consultations with unnamed 'interlocutors' within  Sri
    Lanka.  To the extent to which he spoke of his own knowledge, given his
    practical experience and position within the returns process,  we  give
    it weight.  We are able to give much less weight to the  evidence  from
    the 'interlocutors' since they were not prepared to be identified.

237. Mr Gallagher's evidence as to the preparation and purpose of  the  UKBA
    Country of Origin information was helpful.  We had concerns  about  the
    delay in absorbing and reflecting  criticisms  by  Dr  Rampton  of  the
    breadth of the sources used, in his report to IAGCI on the  March  2012
    Report.  Dr Rampton's criticisms were acknowledged but no  attempt  had
    been made to include them in the December 2012 Policy Bulletin.  It  is
    unfortunate (and perhaps surprising) that the Country  of  Origin  Unit
    was unaware of the imminent UNHCR  guidelines  which  emerged  the  day
    after the Policy Bulletin and  no  adjustment  has  yet  been  made  to
    accommodate that. However, IAGCI and several other witnesses recognised
    that the description in the March 2012 report of circumstances  in  the
    Northern Province of Sri Lanka, in particular, and of the operation  of
    the rehabilitation process, was valid and useful.

238. Mr Wright's evidence set out the difficulty which had been  experienced
    by the UKBA in attempting to identify what turned  out  to  be  a  very
    small number of individuals among the thirteen HRW cases; only three of
    them were asylum seekers who had been abused after  being  returned  to
    Sri Lanka in the relevant period, and one of those  had  been  returned
    from Germany.  FFT and TAG had been uncooperative.  The respondent  had
    been unable to take account of the evidence the three NGOs had produced
    because that would have involved taking it on trust rather than seeking
    to verify the allegations made.

239. The evidence of Ms Athi-Parkin showed an attempt by some  at  least  of
    the  respondent's  casework  groups  to  verify  whether  the   "recent
    returnees" profile existed and how many cases were succeeding  on  that
    basis.   It  was  patchy  and  at  best  anecdotal,  as  her  statement
    acknowledged.

240. Dr Rampton's evidence, both in his role as a consultant  commenting  on
    a particular Country of Origin Report (the March 2012 Sri Lanka report)
    for the IAGCI, and in relation to country conditions generally, was not
    based on personal experience of Sri Lanka after 2010,  his  last  visit
    there.  In his written report, Dr  Rampton  stated  strongly  that  IOM
    monitoring evidence from Sri Lanka should be discounted as  tainted  by
    cooperation between the IOM and the  GOSL.   That  was  a  question  of
    opinion rather than a summary of his sources.   Dr  Rampton  considered
    that the Tribunal should prefer the evidence of HRW, TAG and FFT to any
    evidence from Sri Lanka as to what occurred after return.

241.  We  accept  the  evidence  of  Dr  Rampton  where  it  is  sourced  or
    corroborated.  We accept that he has concerns as to the sources used by
    the respondent in preparing her Country of Origin information but that,
    in general, he considers it  a  helpful  and  balanced  view  of  post-
    conflict Sri Lanka.  We  do  have  concerns  about  the  parts  of  his
    evidence  which  rely  on  undisclosed  sources  and  un-minuted  Skype
    conversations.  Dr Rampton himself has  no  recent  experience  of  the
    conditions in Sri Lanka since he has not been there since shortly after
    the end of the civil war, in 2010.

242. Professor Rodley has great faith in FFT, whose  Board  of  Trustees  he
    chairs.  So far as individual medico legal reports  are  concerned,  in
    general we share his confidence.  FFT's country reports  are  based  on
    the extracting of information from  the  MLRs  prepared  on  individual
    cases. We need to assess in this determination whether they  should  be
    given the same weight which we usually give  to  the  MLRs  themselves,
    when prepared to the Istanbul Protocol standard.

243. Professor Rodley's knowledge of Ms Pettitt's research was  limited  and
    on many occasions he referred us to her evidence for points of  detail.
    He considered that a court or tribunal  attempting  to  assess  torture
    evidence was much less well placed than a trained clinician  and  that,
    therefore, there was no need for the Tribunal to be able to investigate
    or analyse the FFT research, which should be accepted  at  face  value.
    We respectfully disagree; it is our  task  to  do  precisely  that  and
    Professor Rodley's evidence did not allay our  serious  concerns  about
    the reliability and research methods  adopted  in  preparation  of  the
    composite FFT reports.

244. Ms Pettitt's research evidence is set out in Appendix  E.   The  sample
    underlying it  is  relatively  small  and  consists  of  persons  whose
    evidence was found reliable by FFT.  It focuses on the harm suffered by
    the individuals, rather than upon the surrounding factual  matrices  or
    their personal backgrounds.  Her evidence to the Tribunal was  hampered
    by FFT's very  strong  commitment  to  anonymity,  well  beyond  simple
    redaction of names and places, which has made it  difficult  to  assess
    the weight the evidence in the sample group and the  conclusions  which
    she drew therefrom could properly bear.

245. Another difficulty is that we have  seen  no  similar  evidence  as  to
    individuals whose torture accounts  were  rejected  by  FFT.   The  FFT
    evidence goes no further than establishing  that  some  returnees  have
    been ill-treated, some of them with serious and permanent consequences.
     We have not seen the underlying medico legal reports which would  give
    the level of detail which we have  come  to  expect  from  the  Medical
    Foundation (now FFT) and to which in general both  the  respondent  and
    the Tribunal have for many years given weight.

246. We consider that in the light of  the  extreme  redaction  of  the  FFT
    composite report information, and absent any opportunity to examine the
    underlying MLRs, we are unable to give the same weight to the composite
    reports as normally given to FFT  medico-legal  reports.   We  are  not
    satisfied that the methodology  used  is  sufficiently  robust  or  the
    sample either representative or statistically significant, but we  take
    into account the limited evidence which the report provides of  certain
    individuals for whom FFT is said to have prepared MLRs indicating  that
    they had been ill-treated after returning to Sri Lanka.

247. Mr Brad Adams of HRW was unwilling to give  evidence  at  short  notice
    and the parties indicated that they did not wish to cross-examine  him.
    It is clear from the two witness statements prepared  by  Mr  Adams  in
    March 2013 that HRW released reports close to known dates  for  charter
    flights in May and September 2012.  The same happened with the February
    26, 2013 report.  Mr Adams says in both statements  that  the  February
    2013 report was timed for the UN  Human  Rights  Council  session,  but
    absent the opportunity to hear Mr  Adams  on  the  point,  we  are  not
    satisfied as to his explanation.   The  Human  Rights  Council  session
    dates do not support that explanation, since the session began the  day
    before the report was published, although it was in an  advanced  draft
    some three weeks earlier.

248. The Human Rights Council's consideration of the  HRW  evidence  on  Sri
    Lanka was timetabled for 20 March 2013, almost a month after the report
    was published, and we remind ourselves that Ms Hogg  was  aware,  on  8
    February 2013, that it  was  likely  to  be  published  around  the  28
    February (the date of the  charter  flight).   We  are  not  satisfied,
    overall, that the timing of the report  was  primarily  linked  to  the
    Human Rights Council's consideration  of  its  contents:   we  consider
    that, in common with the 2012 reports, the timing  of  its  publication
    was intended, at least in part, to influence the  February  flight  and
    provide material for applications for judicial review.

249. The Upper Tribunal was concerned about the position in which  Ms  Charu
    Lata Hogg was placed:  when she gave evidence on 8 February  2013,  she
    was aware that the HRW report was in an advanced draft, which  she  had
    seen.  She knew that it would be issued on or about  28  February  2013
    (the day of the next intended charter flight) but considered  that  the
    terms of her consultancy did not permit her to reveal  details  of  the
    information underlying her report  before  its  scheduled  publication.
    Even after the report's release, the level of redaction  and  voluntary
    constraint in Ms Hogg's evidence was such that we were,  again,  forced
    to choose whether to simply take her evidence at face value.

250.  Ms  Hogg  told  us  that  she  had  examined  evidence  from   medical
    practitioners, hospitals and solicitors,  and  in  most  cases,  asylum
    interviews,  records,  and  determinations  in  order   to   draw   her
    conclusions.  HRW had  decided  that  the  redaction  of  facts  should
    include non-disclosure of all  names  of  United  Kingdom  doctors  who
    prepared MLRs on the individuals Ms Hogg interviewed.  The redaction of
    any identification of the doctors had been HRW's decision, not that  of
    Ms Hogg.

251. Ms Hogg was unable to disclose any personal details; she did  not  know
    what had happened to the 13 victims in the September 2012  HRW  report;
    she could not assist us as to the election breakdowns on ethnic grounds
    in the 2010 elections. She was able to give her opinion that the  issue
    of Tamil separatism was kept alive in the  diaspora  and  there  was  a
    feeling of discontent and nostalgia for the LTTE, though perhaps not to
    the extent of an appetite for renewed violence.

252. We understand the restrictions placed on Ms  Hogg,  who  as  a  Chatham
    House researcher naturally takes them  very  seriously.   However,  the
    outcome of these  restrictions  is  that  there  is  no  means  of  our
    assessing whether an adequate analysis of the underlying  material  was
    made.

253. We note that the individuals whose difficulties are dealt  with  in  Ms
    Hogg's research all  had  close  personal,  and  often  also  familial,
    connections to the LTTE and,  mostly,  diaspora  activities  likely  to
    bring them to notice.  We note too that like all the  other  witnesses,
    Ms Hogg considered that the LTTE within Sri Lanka  was  a  spent  force
    with any risk to the GOSL now coming from the active  sections  of  the
    diaspora.

254. Ms Jan Jananayagam is the moving force behind  TAG  and  TAG  (Europe),
    which prepared the "Returnees at Risk"[17]  report.   She  dedicated  a
    year of her professional life (her career  and  qualifications  are  in
    finance) to supervision of the production of that report.  We note that
    all three of the NGOs, TAG, HRW and FFT were seeking  independently  to
    prepare reports on the changed circumstances in Sri Lanka and that  the
    TAG researcher had not been  given  access  to  failed  asylum  seekers
    because their names had  been  passed  to  the  HRW  researcher  on  an
    exclusive basis, such that those cases were not available  for  TAG  to
    use in its research.  Ms  Jananayagam  considered  that  this  probably
    explained the  predominance  of  students  in  the  "recent  returnees"
    considered in the TAG report.

255. Ms Jananayagam recognised that the sample group was very small and  was
    distorted by its origins; contrary to Ms  Jegarajah's  submissions,  it
    was  not  her  case  that  the  sample  group  was  representative   or
    statistically significant.  TAG's researcher had  focused  on  accounts
    given by Tamil asylum seekers abroad, and did not seek information from
    Tamils still within the country.  There was little  information  coming
    out of Sri Lanka now and she could not travel or  email  there  herself
    without causing difficulty for those she contacted.  The media was self-
    censored due to government scrutiny; the GOSL put out  adverse  comment
    on  failed  asylum  seekers.  The  GOSL  monitored  emails,   telephone
    conversations, and contacts between Sri Lanka and the diaspora.

256. The LTTE  had  kept  detailed  records,  while  it  was  the  de  facto
    government of the Northern Province.  She did not think  those  records
    were in the  hands  of  the  GOSL  since  it  seemed  to  be  expending
    significant resources on reconstructing them.   Some  people  had  LTTE
    membership cards and identity cards; however, those  in  civil  service
    and even judicial posts  had  no  need  of  a  membership  card.  TAG's
    witnesses did not wish to disclose any war crimes  they  had  seen;  if
    they did admit to having seen them, they asked for confidentiality.

257. We consider that Ms Jananayagam understood  well  the  methodology  and
    value which could be given to the evidence in the TAG  report.   It  is
    anecdotal  and  the  predominance  of  student  cases  may  well  be  a
    statistical irregularity rather than any element of profile:   she  did
    not  seek  to  suggest  that  it  was  representative.   We  take   the
    information there given as indicative rather  than  representative  and
    give it that weight.

258. The evidence of Mr Keenan of International  Crisis  Group  is  in  such
    that little weight can be attached to it.    The  email  has  not  been
    printed as it stands; the excerpt has no covering statement of truth to
    support it; and it is unsigned.  Taken at its highest, it  is  evidence
    that two people disappeared in Sri Lanka on an unspecified date.  It is
    not, therefore, necessarily evidence of what is happening now.

259. Mr Macrae's evidence is based on journalistic research over the  period
    from late 2009 to date.  The information  available  to  Channel  4  at
    various times is summarised in the two  "Sri  Lanka's  Killing  Fields"
    films in 2011 and 2012, but Mr Macrae has available to him a much wider
    range of interviews and accounts, which could not be  included  in  the
    films, by reason both of confidentiality and of time constraints.

260. Mr Macrae interviewed a wide range of people and has  obtained  graphic
    footage of war crimes in 2009 during the final conflict.   He  has  not
    travelled personally to Sri Lanka recently but  in  the  light  of  the
    research underlying his films and his  evidence,  we  are  nevertheless
    able to give weight to his analysis of the  situation  in  the  No-Fire
    Zone in 2009.  Mr Macrae's evidence as to the political  situation  now
    is based on interviews conducted with the  help  of  modern  technology
    with people both within and without Sri Lanka,  and  in  addition,  the
    security assessment of the risk to Channel 4  staff  if  they  were  to
    return to Colombo.

261. We note that the team checked the footage used both  with  the  UN  and
    with independent assessors to check whether  it  was  manipulated.   We
    also note that on 24 October 2011, OFCOM  published  a  report  holding
    that Channel 4 had complied with its obligations and  that  the  report
    been presented in a balanced manner, with due  regard  to  the  graphic
    nature of  the  images  and  the  serious  nature  of  the  allegations
    contained therein.  His reports all focus on the events  in  May  2009,
    the concerns of the international community and  UNHCR  in  particular,
    and the failure of that community or the GOSL to address what happened.
     Their focus is not the profile now for returnees; we mean that  as  no
    criticism of their journalistic force.

262.  Professor  Good's  evidence  is  set  out  in  Appendix  I   to   this
    determination.  He was last in  Sri  Lanka  in  2010.   His  subsequent
    information  is  derived  from  students  and  a  Professor  of  Social
    Anthropology at his former university and we do not, therefore, rely on
    his report for the details it gives of airport procedures nowadays.  We
    accept his evidence as to  the  current  high  levels  of  bribery  and
    corruption in Sri Lanka and matters which may be ascertained  from  the
    press reports and other public information.  When pressed on  areas  of
    more difficulty, in many cases Professor Good was unable to  assist  as
    his information was not up to date.

263. Professor Good suggested two  additional  risk  categories:  (a)  Those
    involved in demonstration against the  GOSL  whilst  overseas  and  (b)
    Those involved in independent media or human rights activities critical
    of the Government of Sri Lanka.  We consider that these  proposed  risk
    groups  have  relevance  in  analysing  the  post-conflict  risk,   the
    demonstration group being relevant only to the extent to which it  will
    cause a person to be perceived as seeking to destabilise the  GOSL  and
    work for the resurgence of the  LTTE  or  a  similar  Tamil  separatist
    organisation.  In relation to (b), that risk group is agreed  to  exist
    by the respondent and is plain from the material before us  that  there
    is a real risk of persecution or serious harm for journalists  critical
    of the government in Sri Lanka, whether foreign or local.

264. Dr Smith's evidence is set out at Appendix J.   It  is  based  on  more
    recent personal knowledge; he had visited  Sri  Lanka  as  recently  as
    December 2012 in order  to  prepare  to  give  his  evidence  in  these
    appeals.  His evidence is supportive of the other evidence before us as
    to militarisation of the Northern Province, and the process  of  return
    to Sri Lanka with the disclosure of personal circumstances  which  that
    involves.  Dr Smith considered that the 12 LP/TK factors remained valid
    but also broadly approved the risk categories identified in  the  UNHCR
    guidelines of December 2012.

265. Dr Smith considered that four additional  issues  would  increase  risk
    now: (a) the lack of an ID card, with the need to travel to one's place
    of origin through checkpoints to obtain a new card  likely  leading  to
    detention; (b) the presence of an LTTE inspired tattoo on a person; (c)
    identification as having protested against the  Sri  Lankan  government
    whilst outside Sri Lanka; and (d) having a mental  health  issue,  with
    those with mental health issues being heavily stigmatised in Sri Lanka.

266. In relation to factor (a), our judgment  is  that  the  weight  of  the
    evidence before us does not support a finding that returnees will be in
    difficulty during travel to their  home  areas  to  refresh  their  Sri
    Lankan documents, in particular their identity cards.   100,000  Tamils
    were without identity cards at the end of the civil war. Returnees will
    have given their onward address  at  the  airport,  will  have  contact
    details for the BHC in Colombo, and are, to some extent,  monitored  by
    IOM in their home areas.  They will be travelling on a TTD if they have
    no other document. There are fewer checkpoints and those operating them
    will know the CID or police check  all  returnees  shortly  after  they
    reach the home area, and that those on a "stop" list would not pass the
    airport.

267. As regards (b), there was only one case in the press reports  in  which
    a person with an LTTE tattoo came to harm.   A  tattoo  is  a  form  of
    scarring; Dr Smith's evidence was that scarring was relevant only  when
    a person was detained for other reasons, when they would be stripped to
    their  underwear  during  interrogation  and  scarring  might  increase
    suspicion.  We do not consider that there  is  sufficient  evidence  to
    support having an LTTE tattoo as a risk factor.

268. We consider that Dr Smith's factor (c) has relevance, in  circumstances
    where the GOSL has reason to consider that  a  person  has  significant
    involvement in diaspora activities which may unsettle the situation  in
    Sri Lanka and lead either to the resurgence of the LTTE  or  a  similar
    militia, or to the revival of the internal conflict.

269. As regards the mental health question, Dr Smith was  the  only  witness
    to suggest that having a mental health  issue  is  a  risk  factor  for
    persecution, in the context of  the  third  appellant,  who  does  have
    mental health problems.  The research upon which he relied consisted of
    an  abstract  from  a  paper  in  the  journal  Social  Psychiatry  and
    Psychiatric Epidemiology entitled  "Sri  Lankan  doctors'  and  medical
    undergraduates' attitudes towards  mental  illness".   The  conclusions
    appear to have been taken out of context and the  full  paper  has  not
    been examined.  The summary of the results, not set out in his opinion,
    was as follows:

       "Results
       The study revealed higher levels of  stigma  towards  patients  with
       depression, alcohol and drug addiction in  this  Sri  Lankan  sample
       compared to UK data but attitudes towards  schizophrenia  were  less
       stigmatized in Sri Lanka. Blaming attitudes were  consistently  high
       across diagnoses in  the  Sri  Lankan  sample.  Sri  Lankan  medical
       students displayed more negative attitudes than doctors (P < 0.001).
       Overall stigma was greatest towards patients  with  drug  addiction,
       followed by, alcohol  addiction,  schizophrenia,  depression,  panic
       disorder and dementia."

270. The abstract suggests that medical students may lack  understanding  of
    mental health problems and should meet recovered  patients,  to  change
    their approach; but it  also  suggests  that  doctors,  as  opposed  to
    students, have a more nuanced approach.

271. Paragraph 132 of Dr Smith's opinion is based on research  published  in
    2001, before the tsunami; his opinion is also informed by conversations
    he has had in which he suggests that the mentally ill are considered to
    be "possessed".  We do not consider that "mental health" should now  be
    an additional risk factor for persecution or serious harm, although, on
    a case by case basis and applying  Article  8  ECHR,  the  private  and
    family life rights of individuals with  mental  health  issues  may  be
    determinative of their appeals.

272. Nor are we satisfied that the evidence on identity cards  is  as  stark
    as Dr Smith suggests, given that charter flight returnees in particular
    travel back on documents provided by the GOSL and are  permitted,  once
    interviewed, to return to their home areas, where they will be able  to
    replace any documents which are missing.  Identity checks will  already
    have been made.  We do not  consider,  therefore,  that  this  risk  is
    distinct from the new risk of being perceived as a  person  seeking  to
    destabilise the GOSL by actively working for resurgence  of  the  Tamil
    conflict.

273. Professor Gunaratna is an insider in  relation  to  the  GOSL  and  his
    views are interesting as a reflection of its  mindset.   He  helped  to
    design and assess the rehabilitation programme, although  his  evidence
    lacks specifics as to its operation.  We accept his evidence  that  the
    government's concerns are now with  the  diaspora  and  that  the  LTTE
    within Sri Lanka is a spent force  at  present.   We  also  accept  his
    evidence that the GOSL  is  more  selective  now  as  to  who  requires
    rehabilitation in the present climate.

274. Mr Saravanamuttu's evidence was  in  written  form  only.   He  is  the
    Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives in Colombo; he
    has a prominent international human rights profile and in 2009 received
    a death threat and was detained at Colombo airport by the TID.  He  has
    been and remains a subject of hostile comment within Sri Lanka for  his
    views.  This year there has been a poster campaign against him. In  his
    report, Mr Saravanamuttu declined to engage with all of  the  questions
    asked of  him,  citing  "time  pressures".   He  deals  only  with  the
    situation in the former LTTE areas, and the political situation in  Sri
    Lanka since the civil war ended.  His report is mainly a collection  of
    quotations from other material, with little of his own opinion.   Since
    we did not hear oral evidence from Mr Saravanamuttu we can  place  only
    limited weight  on  his  evidence  but  where  it  supports  the  other
    evidence, we have taken it into account.

275. Mr Anton Punethanayagam's evidence is that of a  practitioner  who  has
    dealt with 3000 cases of  detainees,  in  Colombo  and  Vavuniya.   His
    evidence on the process of bribery was particularly useful.  We did not
    have the opportunity of hearing him give oral evidence, and some of his
    evidence goes beyond what he can be taken to know himself but where his
    evidence concerns the criminal processes in Sri Lanka, we consider that
    it is useful and reliable.  We take particular account of his view that
    the  seriousness  of  any  charges  against  an  individual   are   not
    determinative of whether a bribe can be paid, and that it  is  possible
    to leave through the airport even  when  a  person  is  being  actively
    sought.

276. Dr Suthaharan Nadarajah  of  SOAS  was  asked  by  the  United  Kingdom
    government last year to brief the  Independent  Reviewer  on  Terrorism
    Legislation on the effectiveness of proscribing organisations  and  the
    effect of such proscription on civil society.  Like many witnesses,  he
    considered that the GOSL was vexed by activities in  the  diaspora  but
    that it was  aware  that  many  failed  asylum  seekers  were  economic
    migrants.  His views on the effectiveness of the President's new  Human
    Rights Commission are strongly expressed; his  expertise  is  terrorism
    and he has not researched the position of returned asylum seekers.  His
    explanation of the Martyrs Day, Heroes  Day  and  Tamil  Uprising  were
    helpful;  his evidence as to what happens in Sri Lanka now  is  derived
    from telephone conversations, Skype, internet exchanges and discussions
    with visiting journalists, since he has not been to Sri  Lanka  himself
    for ten years.

277. The press reports are generally supportive of  the  views  of  all  the
    experts.  They add nothing particular to the other evidence before  us,
    save for the Indian publication Economic and  Political  Weekly,  which
    analysed the high levels of militarisation in the Northern Province  in
    striking terms, putting it in context with the behaviour  of  the  LTTE
    and the fears of the GOSL. That analysis of the level of penetration of
    the Northern Province and the GOSL and local population's  approach  to
    security is supportive both of the other evidence of militarisation and
    of the indications that the LTTE within Sri Lanka  is  a  spent  force.
    The GOSL is looking abroad to the diaspora and its activities  for  any
    present risk of resurgence or  of  the  conflict  resuming  within  the
    country.

Confidentiality and the public reports

278. It is both unfortunate and unhelpful that  the  concerns  expressed  by
    FFT and HRW as to  confidentiality  are  so  extensive  that  they  are
    unwilling to cooperate in enabling the respondent to  verify  from  her
    own database the examples on which they rely.  As a result, information
    which could usefully have  informed  the  assessment  of  risk  by  the
    respondent and thus altered  the  course  of  a  number  of  individual
    assessments was deprived of the weight it could have gained from  cross
    referencing the respondent's files.

279. The position  in  relation  to  Ms  Hogg's  evidence  was  particularly
    unfortunate.   Ms  Hogg  was  tendered  as  a  witness  for  the  third
    appellant, but was so tightly constrained by confidentiality provisions
    imposed upon her by HRW (even to the extent of not being  permitted  to
    acknowledge them as her employer) that there was hardly  any  point  in
    her giving oral evidence at all before the report  was  published.   We
    have treated her as effectively a witness for HRW.

280. We have considered Mr Adams' written evidence; we are unable to  accept
    his evidence that the timing of the February 2013 report was  unrelated
    to the proposed flight on 28 February 2013.  Had we had the opportunity
    to hear from him, we might have been able to place more weight  on  his
    evidence but, save where it is otherwise corroborated, we do  not  feel
    able to do so.

Timing of flights and reports

281. It seems clear that both the UKBA and  the  NGOs  (HRW,  TAG  and  FFT)
    endeavour to produce new evidence close to the time of proposed charter
    flights.  We were particularly troubled to note that on  at  least  two
    occasions, HRW had timed reports for a day  or  two  before  a  flight,
    whereas, at least in the case of the February 26  report  to  which  Ms
    Hogg contributed, the advanced draft of that report  had  been  settled
    early in February  2013.   It  is  wasteful  of  resources  to  produce
    evidence just a day or two before a flight,  giving  rise  to  multiple
    judicial review applications, when the facts contained  in  the  report
    could have been considered properly over a  period  of  several  weeks,
    enabling the respondent to refine her assessment of whether  particular
    individuals should be removed.

282. The respondent did not distinguish herself in this respect either:   in
    relation to the  February  2013  flight,  when  the  dates  were  first
    mentioned in court she maintained that they were confidential and  that
    the Tribunal should not be made aware  of  the  date  of  the  proposed
    flight. The flight dates were known to the representatives since a good
    many of their other Tamil clients had been given letters  telling  them
    they were to be removed on that date.

283. Arrangements for the flight had commenced at the end of  2012  and  had
    not been halted or stayed pending the wide-ranging assessment which the
    respondent knew was planned  for  early  February  2013.   The  initial
    hearings took place over the first week of February  and  it  was  most
    unlikely, given the vast number of  documents  and  witnesses,  that  a
    country guidance decision would appear by the end of February.

284. In Hamid, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2012]  EWHC  3070,  the  President  of  the  Queen's  Bench
    Division, Sir John Thomas, giving the judgment of the  court,  deplored
    last minute applications by claimants in the following terms:

           "2.   This court, because of a very substantial number  of  such
           claims, has now revised its form N463. First the  form  requires
           in section 1 that the reasons for urgency be  stated.  Secondly,
           it requires in section 2 the appellant to state the timetable in
           which the  matter  should  be  heard.  Third,  it  requires  the
           justification  for  immediate  consideration  to  be  given.  In
           particular it requires the date  and  time  when  it  was  first
           appreciated that an immediate  application  might  be  necessary
           and, if there have been  any  delays,  the  reasons  are  to  be
           stated. Also the form requires any efforts that have  been  made
           to put the defendant and any interested party on  notice  to  be
           set out.

           3.    The form was  revised  because  the  Administrative  Court
           faces an ever increasing large volume of applications in respect
           of pending removals said  to  require  immediate  consideration.
           Many are filed towards the end of the working day, often on  the
           day of the flight or the evening before  a  morning  flight.  In
           many of these applications the person concerned  has  known  for
           some time, at least a matter of days, of his  removal.  Many  of
           these cases are totally without merit. The court infers that  in
           many cases applications are left to the last moment in the  hope
           that it will result in a deferral of the removal.

           4.    The Court of Appeal in R (Madan) v Secretary of State  for
           the Home Department [2007] 1 WLR 2891 set out  in  the  judgment
           given by Buxton LJ a number of principles  that  must  be  taken
           into account by legal advisers on attempts  to  obtain  judicial
           review of removal decisions: see paragraph 17 and in  particular
           the following sub-paragraphs:

           "i) CPR PD 54.18 makes provision for  the  hearing  of  judicial
           review applications in the Administrative Court against  removal
           from the jurisdiction. Such applications must be  made  promptly
           on the intimation of a deportation decision, and not  await  the
           actual fixing of removal arrangements.

           ii) The detailed statement required by PD 18.2(c) must include a
           statement of all previous applications made in  respect  of  the
           applicant's immigration status, and  indicate  how  the  present
           state of the case differs from previous applications.

           iii) Counsel or solicitors attending ex parte before  the  judge
           in the Administrative Court are under  professional  obligations
           (a) to draw the judge's attention to any matter adverse to their
           clients' case, including  in  particular  any  previous  adverse
           decisions; and (b) to take a full note of the  judge's  judgment
           or reasons, which should then be  submitted  to  the  judge  for
           approval.  ...

           viii) Counsel will remember that where the application  is  made
           ex parte there is a particular obligation to  draw  the  court's
           attention to relevant authority, including in particular Country
           Guidance cases."

           As Buxton LJ pointed out at paragraph 8, there are circumstances
           in which professional misconduct can arise if an application  is
           made with  the  view  to  postponing  the  implementation  of  a
           previous decision where there  are  no  proper  grounds  for  so
           doing."

285. The practice which developed in 2012 among NGOs such as  HRW,  FFT  and
    TAG, of producing press releases very shortly before a flight, followed
    by large  numbers  of  last-minute  applications  for  injunctions  and
    judicial  review,  falls  foul  of  the  Hamid  principle.   The   late
    production of publicly published new material from the NGOs removes any
    opportunity for the respondent to deal with it in a timely fashion  (to
    the extent that it is really new, rather than a  reframing  of  earlier
    material).  It also removes  any  opportunity  for  the  respondent  to
    examine individual cases and decide,  if  appropriate,  not  to  remove
    those  individuals,  without  the   need   for   emergency   injunction
    applications at significant expense, both to the individuals  concerned
    and the public purse.  On the occasions where a charter flight has been
    cancelled, that also entails significant public expense.

286. In the present case, several of the representatives at the  hearing  on
    6 February 2013 had seen removal letters for the charter flight  on  28
    February 2013, sent the previous week (that is to say, in late  January
    or very early February).  We were told that  the  flight  itself  would
    have been arranged in early January 2013.  There  was  thus  more  than
    sufficient time  for  applications  for  judicial  review  to  be  made
    'promptly' as the Rules  require.  We  do  not  know  whether  'prompt'
    applications had been made in respect of  those  particular  claimants,
    since their names and other details were not relevant  in  the  present
    proceedings and were not disclosed.

287. However, to the extent that the claimants and those  representing  them
    were aware that the HRW reports, and possibly the FFT and TAG  reports,
    were being timed to coincide with the charter  flights,  were  this  to
    occur again, they  are  reminded  of  the  guidance  given  as  to  the
    necessity to make an application for judicial review 'promptly' as  set
    out in the Hamid judgment.

UNHCR guidelines

288. Revised UNHCR Guidelines issued on 21 December 2012 reflect  the  post-
    conflict changes in Sri Lanka now and, in common with our  own  country
    guidance, have not been reviewed since very soon after the end  of  the
    conflict.  The previous UNHCR Guidelines were issued in July 2010.  The
    Preamble to the present document sets out the need for new guidelines:

           "These Guidelines ... are issued against  the  backdrop  of  the
           current situation in The Democratic Socialist  Republic  of  Sri
           Lanka (hereafter Sri Lanka), where ongoing human rights concerns
           are reported, including in particular with regard to reports  of
           post-conflict justice, torture and mistreatment, disappearances,
           arbitrary detention and freedom of expression.

           UNHCR's recommendations, as set out  in  these  Guidelines,  are
           summarized below.

           All claims lodged by Sri Lankan asylum-seekers, whether  on  the
           basis of the refugee criteria contained in the 1951  Convention,
           or complementary forms  of  protection  based  on  human  rights
           obligations, need to be considered on their own merits according
           to fair and efficient status determination procedures and up-to-
           date  and  relevant  country   of   origin   information.   More
           specifically, the possible risks  facing  individuals  with  the
           profiles   outlined   below   require    particularly    careful
           examination.  UNHCR  considers  that  individuals   with   these
           profiles - though this list is not exhaustive - may be,  and  in
           some cases are likely to be in  need  of  international  refugee
           protection, depending on the individual circumstances  of  their
           case."

289. The list of groups requiring  'particularly  careful  examination'  who
    may be, and in some cases are likely to be, in  need  of  international
    protection was as follows:

           "(i)  persons suspected of certain links with the Liberation
                 Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE);
            (ii) certain opposition politicians and political activists;
           (iii)       certain journalists and other media professionals;
           (iv)  certain human rights activists;
           (v)   certain witnesses of human rights violations  and  victims
                 of human rights violations seeking justice;
           (vi)  women in certain circumstances;
           (vii)       children in certain circumstances; and
           (viii)      lesbian, gay,  bisexual,  transgender  and  intersex
                 (LGBTI) individuals in certain circumstances."

    The evidence which we have received relates to the first five  subheads
    in particular.  Mr Hall accepted that  those  who  were  detained  were
    likely to be ill-treated and  the  evidence  suggests  that,  for  both
    sexes, that ill-treatment sometimes includes sexual abuse.  We have not
    been taken to evidence relating to children or to LGBTI individuals and
    the guidance in this determination does not, therefore, deal separately
    with women, children, or LGBTI individuals.

290. We have considered the passage on  page  27  of  the  UNHCR  Guidelines
    relied upon by Miss Jegarajah:  with  respect,  we  disagree  with  her
    assessment that it asserts that any former  links  with  the  LTTE  are
    determinative of an asylum claim today.  The relevant passage begins on
    page 26 and reads as follows:

      "A. Risk Profiles
      A.1 Persons Suspected of Certain Links with the Liberation  Tigers  of
      Tamil Eelam (LTTE)

      At the height of its influence in Sri Lanka  in  2000-2001,  the  LTTE
      controlled and administered 76% of  what  are  now  the  Northern  and
      Eastern Provinces. Therefore, all persons living in those  areas,  and
      at the outer fringes of the areas under LTTE control, necessarily  had
      contact with the LTTE and its civilian administration in  their  daily
      lives. Originating from an area that was previously controlled by  the
      LTTE does not in itself result in a  need  for  international  refugee
      protection in the sense of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol.

      However, previous (real or  perceived)  links  that  go  beyond  prior
      residency within an area controlled by the  LTTE  continue  to  expose
      individuals  to  treatment  which  may  give  rise  to  a   need   for
      international refugee protection, depending on the  specifics  of  the
      individual case. The nature of these more elaborate links to the  LTTE
      can vary, but may include people with the following profiles:


           1) Persons who held senior positions with considerable authority
           in the LTTE  civilian  administration,  when  the  LTTE  was  in
           control of large parts of what are now the Northern and  Eastern
           Provinces;
           2) Former LTTE combatants or "cadres";
           3) Former LTTE combatants or "cadres"  who,  due  to  injury  or
           other reason, were employed by the LTTE in functions within  the
           administration,  intelligence,  "computer   branch"   or   media
           (newspaper and radio);
           4) Former LTTE supporters who may never have undergone  military
           training, but were involved in sheltering or  transporting  LTTE
           personnel, or the supply and transport of goods for the LTTE;
           5) LTTE fundraisers and propaganda activists and those with,  or
           perceived as having had, links to the Sri Lankan  diaspora  that
           provided funding and other support to the LTTE;
           6) Persons with family links or who are dependent on or
           otherwise closely related to persons with the above profiles.

      When assessing claims of persons with  the  profiles  above,  it  may,
      depending on the individual circumstances of the claim,  be  important
      to  examine  the  applicability  of  the   exclusion   clauses.   ..."
                                            [Emphasis added]

    The effect of that  passage  is  that  these  categories  remain  fact-
    specific.  We shall set out later, in the  light  of  the  wide-ranging
    expertise we have heard and read, what we  consider  to  be  the  fact-
    specific risk groups, some of which overlap with the general categories
    set out in the UNHCR guidelines  generally  and  at  paragraph  A.1  in
    particular.

291. The UNHCR Guidelines do not suggest that in the unitary  Sinhalese  Sri
    Lankan state any internal relocation option exists for those  for  whom
    the persecution feared emanates from the state, given the  broad  reach
    of the security apparatus and the small size of the country[18].

           "UNHCR  considers  that  an  internal   flight   or   relocation
           alternative is not available in Sri Lanka  in  cases  where  the
           feared persecution emanates from the state  itself  or  elements
           associated with it. Given the small size of the country, coupled
           with the broad reach of the security  apparatus,  the  effective
           territorial control maintained by  the  Sri  Lankan  Army  (SLA)
           since the end of the armed conflict, the  "relevance"  criterion
           of the internal flight or relocation alternative test would  not
           be met in such cases."

292. Again that accords with the weight of the evidence  before  us.   UNHCR
    nevertheless considers that relocation may be available where the  fear
    is of non-state agents:

           "An internal flight or relocation alternative may  be  available
           in cases where the feared persecution  emanates  from  non-state
           agents. In instances where an internal relocation  option  would
           be relevant, it may nevertheless not be reasonable, depending on
           the circumstances of the individual  case.  Serious  social  and
           economic challenges remain in areas previously affected by armed
           conflict, where livelihood opportunities are extremely limited."

293. In the light of human rights abuses on all sides during  the  conflict,
    UNHCR identifies a list of categories where the exclusion provisions of
    the Refugee Convention under Article 1F may be engaged:

      "(i)  Certain (former) Government officials,  including  in  functions
          with responsibilities relating to the conduct of war  during  the
          final phases of the conflict, and those posted in  the  conflict-
          affected areas during the final phase of the conflict;
      (ii)  Certain (former) members  of  the  Sri  Lankan  Army  and  other
          security forces;
      (iii)       Certain (former) members of the Sri Lanka  Police  Service
          (SLPS), including the Criminal Investigation Division (CID),  the
          Terrorist Investigation Department (TID), and  the  Special  Task
          Force (STF);
      (iv)  Certain  former  members  of  the  LTTE,  in  particular  former
          combatants;
      (v)   Certain (former) members of the 'Tamil Makkal Viduthali Pulikal'
          (TMVP), including the Karuna faction and the Inya Barathi Group;
      (vi)  Certain (former) members of the Eelam People's Democratic  Party
          (EPDP);
      (vii)        Certain  (former)  members  of  the  People's  Liberation
          Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE); and
      (viii)      Certain (former) members of other pro- and anti-government
          militias and paramilitary groups."

    Decision makers (including judges) dealing with returns  to  Sri  Lanka
    must be alive to the possibility that exclusion, both under Article  1F
    of the Refugee  Convention  and  Article  12(2)  of  the  Qualification
    Directive, may apply, whether raised by the parties or not.

294. On 19 March  2013,  the  UN  General  Assembly  adopted  a  resolution,
    recognising the efforts made by the Sri  Lankan  authorities  following
    the  LLRC  report,  but  criticising   implementation   of   the   LLRC
    recommendations as inadequate and calling for action on  human  rights.
    A Sri Lankan government representative spoke in the debate:  the GOSL's
    position throughout has been that no war crimes were committed and that
    any international perception to the contrary is  a  worldwide  pro-LTTE
    conspiracy and completely untrue.

General situation in Sri Lanka

295. We now set out our  general  findings  as  to  recent  events  and  the
    present situation in Sri Lanka, before dealing  with  certain  specific
    points raised by the parties and TAG.

296. The Sri Lankan civil war ended in May 2009, with the  Eastern  Province
    having  returned  to  government  control  in  2007.   The  Sri  Lankan
    government regained control of the Northern Province-east of Sri  Lanka
    in 2007.  In the closing days of the civil war, Tamils were  encouraged
    to make use of No-Fire Zones  in  north-eastern  Sri  Lanka  and  about
    350,000 did so.  International  observers,  journalists  and  most  aid
    groups were asked to leave the conflict zone. Explosions  and  shelling
    in the three  successive  No-Fire  Zones,  including  field  hospitals,
    caused many deaths.  Supplies of both food and water  were  inadequate,
    particularly in the third, smallest no-fire zone used at the  very  end
    of the civil war.

297. The LTTE was crushed and within Sri Lanka is now a spent  force.  There
    have been no terrorist incidents at all since May 2009.  The  GOSL  has
    control of the whole country and internal relocation is not  an  option
    if the security forces have an adverse interest in an individual, since
    there are no LTTE areas where an individual may be safe. At the end  of
    the civil war, about 160,000 Tamils were unaccounted for, but as in any
    conflict zone, there are real difficulties in establishing how reliable
    any such statistics may be.  Estimates of deaths in the  No-Fire  Zones
    range between about 10,000 and 70,000.  The Sri Lankan  government  has
    consistently blamed the LTTE for the deaths, while the Tamil  community
    attributes the deaths to government actions.  A fuller consideration of
    these events is for other bodies who will have far  more  comprehensive
    evidence to consider.

298. At the end of the civil war, all Tamils  (300,000  approximately)  were
    required to go to IDP camps in the Vavuniya area, of which the  largest
    was Menik Farm.  They were required to  remain  there  while  the  GOSL
    identified 11,000 LTTE cadres and supporters considered to require  re-
    education ("rehabilitation")  before  returning  to  Sri  Lankan  civil
    society.  The rehabilitation camps were separate from  the  IDP  camps.
    People were encouraged to identify themselves if they had  spent  'even
    one day with the Tigers'.

299. The legal basis of detention  of  the  11,000  former  LTTE  cadres  is
    unclear.  There  is  no  statutory  provision  for  the  rehabilitation
    process.  They were detained and re-educated for a  minimum  period  of
    two years (some have been detained as long as four years)  without  any
    judicial supervision.  It does not appear that physical harm  was  part
    of the rehabilitation programme, but other than that,  details  of  the
    programme are scarce.

300. Those being rehabilitated were taught  the  Sinhala  language  and  may
    have been taught civilian occupations:  the civil  war  had  lasted  25
    years and many of the younger cadres may never  have  had  a  peacetime
    occupation.  10,500 rehabilitated LTTE cadres have been released;  they
    are subject to monitoring, residence, and reporting conditions in their
    home areas.  Only a dozen or so of those rehabilitated have returned to
    ordinary crime and none are known to have returned to terrorism.

301. In Presidential and Parliamentary elections in 2010, Mahinda  Rajapaksa
    of the United People's Freedom Alliance was re-elected  President  with
    an overwhelming majority.  His party obtained 144 seats  (national  and
    local).  Parties representing Tamils won just 14  seats.   The  Defence
    Secretary,  Gotobaya  Rajapaksa,  the  Cabinet  Minister  of   Economic
    Development, Basil  Rajapaksa,  and  the  Speaker  of  the  Sri  Lankan
    Parliament, Chamal Rajapaksa, as well as a number  of  other  political
    figures are members of the same family.  It is said that the  Rajapaksa
    family controls 75% of the national budget and has 200 members in civil
    service posts.

302. In May 2010, the Sri Lankan government established  a  Lessons  Learned
    and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), mandated to inquire and report on
    matters 'that may  have  taken  place  during  the  period  between  21
    February 2002 and 19 May 2009.  The  LLRC's  report  was  delivered  to
    President Rajapaksa on 15 November 2011 and made public on 16  December
    2011.  Many of its recommendations have not yet been  implemented.   On
    19 March 2013, the UN  General  Assembly's  concerns  as  to  the  slow
    implementation of the recommendations.   On  March  24  2013,  the  Sri
    Lankan government (GOSL) stated publicly that it expected to  meet  the
    UN-imposed deadline for implementation of all recommendations by  March
    2014.

303. The  GOSL  is  reasonably  confident  that  there  is  a  low  risk  of
    resurgence of the internal armed conflict from within Sri  Lanka.   Its
    concern is with the risk of resurgence coming  from  the  diaspora,  of
    which London, Paris, Toronto and Oslo are major centres ('the  diaspora
    hotspots').  There are approximately one  million  Tamils  outside  Sri
    Lanka, mostly in the diaspora hotspots.

304. All the IDP camps established in 2009 (in particular Menik  Farm)  have
    now closed, although some are still occupied by Tamils who  cannot  yet
    return   home.    However,   despite   some   reconstruction   of   the
    infrastructure in the Northern and Eastern  Provinces,  conditions  for
    approximately 200,000 Tamils returning to their  homes  in  the  former
    Tamil areas remain difficult.  In the Northern Province, returning IDPs
    have difficulty in accessing their lands and businesses, and employment
    is scarce.  High Security Zones (HSZs) identified for  de-mining  cover
    large areas of  the  Northern  Province,  are  closed  to  non-military
    personnel and remain unavailable to those who lived  there  before  the
    civil war.

305. The Northern Province is heavily militarised.  The GOSL  has  increased
    the size and budget for its army and there is now one soldier for every
    five members of the population in  the  Northern  Province.   Permanent
    army barracks  are  being  constructed.   The  army  operates  civilian
    businesses,  hotels,  restaurants,  farms,  shops   and   tourism   and
    employment for returning Tamils is scarce.  The infrastructure is being
    gradually restored but the GOSL intends that  the  area  shall  not  be
    considered a Tamil area.  Cash incentives equivalent to several hundred
    pounds at today's rates are available for Sinhalese soldiers who settle
    in the Northern Province and have a third child. Street names are being
    changed and other cultural markers are being replaced.   The  President
    says it is no longer a "mainly Tamil area".

306. President Rajapaksa has stated repeatedly that the GOSL's  approach  to
    security is now  intelligence-led.   The  security  services  debriefed
    thousands of Tamils at the end of  the  civil  war  and  the  GOSL  has
    available to it sophisticated, high quality intelligence,  enabling  it
    to evaluate and assess the risk posed by  particular  individuals  both
    within and without Sri Lanka.

307. Sri Lankans returning without a Sri Lankan  passport  will  require  an
    Emergency Travel Document for which they need to apply at the  SLHC  in
    London.  Full disclosure of all relevant identity information is  given
    in the process of obtaining a TTD.  An applicant  completes  a  lengthy
    disclosure form  and  is  then  interviewed  at  the  Sri  Lankan  High
    Commission in London; the information received is sent to the  Ministry
    of External Affairs and the Department of Immigration and Emigration in
    Colombo.  Files are created and records verified;  if  the  authorities
    agree to issue a TTD, the MEA in Colombo emails the document to the Sri
    Lankan High Commission in London where the TTD is stamped, a photograph
    added, and issued to the applicant.

308. During the re-documentation process in the United Kingdom,  or  at  the
    airport on return, a forced returnee can expect to be asked  about  his
    own and his family's LTTE connections and sympathies.

309. Those with Sri Lankan passports returning on scheduled flights will  be
    able to walk through Colombo airport without difficulty,  unless  their
    names are on a "stop" list, by reason of an outstanding Court order  or
    arrest warrant.  Those on a "watch" list are not stopped at the airport
    but will be monitored and if considered to be a  destabilisation  risk,
    may be picked up from their home area.

310. There are no detention facilities at the airport. Although  individuals
    may be interviewed at the airport  by  the  security  forces,  the  Sri
    Lankan authorities now aim to move returnees relatively quickly out  of
    the airport and on their way to their home areas and to verify  whether
    they have arrived there soon afterward.  If  the  authorities  have  an
    adverse interest in an individual, he will be picked up at home, not at
    the airport, unless there is a "stop" notice on  the  airport  computer
    system. There is no evidence that strip searches occur at the  airport;
    the GOSL's approach is intelligence-led rather  than  being  driven  by
    roundups and checkpoints as it was during the civil war.

311. The LTTE was the de facto  government  of  large  areas  of  Sri  Lanka
    during the conflict and all residents of those areas at times  of  LTTE
    governance would have LTTE connections. The majority  of  the  examples
    which the parties produced of those who  were  ill-treated  on  return,
    were of persons who had  significant  LTTE  links  (whether  direct  or
    familial). The evidence is that although LTTE cadres were screened  out
    and rehabilitated in May 2009, the government's concern now is not with
    past  membership  or  sympathy,  but  with  whether  a  person   is   a
    destabilising threat in post-conflict Sri Lanka.

312. Individuals returned on TTDs without a Sri  Lankan  identity  card  may
    need to go back to  their  home  area  in  Sri  Lanka  to  replace  it,
    obtaining a certificate from their Grama Sevaka.  The certificate  must
    be obtained in person and they may be stopped at checkpoints during the
    journey.  The checkpoints are not linked to the  security  services  or
    the computer system.

Particular issues:

313. The appellants advanced a range of risk  profiles:   for  TAG  and  the
    first appellant, Miss Jegarajah argued that any Tamil returning to  Sri
    Lanka was at risk.  Mr Mackenzie and Mr Spurling did not go as  far  as
    that:  both adopted a more nuanced position, as is also  found  in  the
    UNHCR Guidelines.  Mr Hall recognised that there would have to be  some
    changes to the categories or factors in the previous country  guidance:
    that was to be expected, given that all of the previous  determinations
    were based on the situation either during or shortly after the end of a
    brutal civil war.

314. We  examine  the  factual  position  today  to  see  what  guidance  is
    appropriate.  We do not underestimate the losses suffered by the Tamils
    at the end of the civil war.  We make the following factual findings on
    the basis of all the evidence before us.

No-Fire Zones

315.  Between  40,000  and  100,000  Tamil  civilians  died  in  government-
    designated NFZs in the final days of the civil war in May  2009.  There
    were three successive NFZs, progressively smaller  and  moving  further
    east.  Supplies of both food and water in  the  NFZs  were  inadequate.
    Shelling of the field hospital at  Mullaivaikkal  caused  many  deaths.
    The GOSL has consistently blamed the LTTE for  the  deaths;  the  Tamil
    community attributes the deaths to the actions of the GOSL.   The  GOSL
    continues  to  describe  this  a  period   when   they   were   seeking
    'humanitarian' protection of those in the  NFZs,  but  its  account  is
    overwhelmingly rejected in the material we have seen, in particular  in
    the "Sri Lanka's Killing Fields" series.

Rehabilitation

316.  The  "rehabilitation"  programme  was  designed  by  the  Sri   Lankan
    government to re-educate former LTTE cadres, who may never  have  known
    peace, and enable them to return to the community as ordinary citizens.
     The  best  evidence  on  this  should  have  been  that  of  Professor
    Gunaratna, who helped design the programme, but in  fact,  very  little
    information was provided by him or anyone else about the  operation  of
    the programme.  Very little is publicly known of what takes place, save
    that former fighters are apparently taught the Sinhala language and how
    to reintegrate into civilian society.  There is no allegation that they
    are physically harmed during rehabilitation, although they are detained
    for long periods (typically two years) without judicial oversight.  The
    only statutory justification appears to  be  the  detention  provisions
    under the PTA.

317. Those who have been rehabilitated are monitored  and  are  required  to
    report regularly and live in their home areas; the GOSL has  confidence
    that those who have been through rehabilitation are unlikely to  return
    to combat but monitors them closely.  The nuisance value, or worse,  of
    such monitoring depends on how it is enforced by the local commander in
    each area.  Professor Gunaratna's evidence was that 11500 of the  12000
    originally identified  have  now  been  rehabilitated:   only  12  have
    lapsed, into ordinary crime, and none have  returned  to  terrorism  or
    extremism.

318. Professor Gunaratna's opinion, which we accept, is that there has  been
    a qualitative change in the purpose  of  the  rehabilitation  programme
    between 2009 and now.  The government's concern now  relates  to  those
    who may be associated with attempts  to  destabilise  the  unitary  Sri
    Lanka by reviving the LTTE within the diaspora. His evidence  explained
    how the Sri Lankan authorities would approach selection of  individuals
    for rehabilitation now:  he told us that those  within  Sri  Lanka  who
    undertake high profile separatist activity (such as the Jaffna students
    trying to celebrate Maaveerar Naal in November 2011) or who  are  known
    or perceived (while still in Sri Lanka) to be seeking contact with  the
    leaders or  activists  of  the  resurgence  movement  in  the  diaspora
    hotspots, risk detention or "rehabilitation".

319. In the light of the above, despite the restrictions  on  movement,  and
    the reporting conditions which the local commanders impose, we  do  not
    consider that post-rehabilitation monitoring alone rises to  the  level
    of persecution.

The Rajapaksa government

320. President Mahinda Rajapaksa of the  United  People's  Freedom  Alliance
    became President in 2005 and was re-elected after post-war Presidential
    and Parliamentary elections in 2010.   His  party  obtained  144  seats
    (national and local).  Parties representing Tamils won just 14 seats.

321. The Defence Secretary, Gotobaya  Rajapaksa,  the  Cabinet  Minister  of
    Economic Development, Basil Rajapaksa,  and  the  Speaker  of  the  Sri
    Lankan Parliament, Chamal Rajapaksa, as  well  as  a  number  of  other
    political figures are members of the same family.  It is said that  the
    Rajapaksa  family  controls  75%  of  the  national  budget  and   that
    approximately 200 members of the Rajapaksa family are employed  by  the
    GOSL in the civil service and elsewhere.

Government's attitude to returning asylum seekers

322. The GOSL has publicly invited the Tamil diaspora  to  return  and  take
    part in the reconstruction of the Northern Province and Sri Lanka after
    the civil war.   However,  many  of  the  witnesses  stated  that  they
    considered this to be in conflict with the GOSL's reluctance to receive
    back those who might seek to revive  the  internal  armed  conflict  or
    destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state.  Dr Smith's evidence  of  the
    intensive  screening  in  the  Vanni  in  2012  (when  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities considered that LTTE activists might have  returned  there)
    illustrates the GOSL's overwhelming concern to ensure that the internal
    armed conflict never recurs.

323. The Bilateral Readmission Agreement, which we have  not  seen,  clearly
    provides re-documentation procedures, operated in the  SLHC  in  London
    and elsewhere, but resulting in a  full  consideration  of  whether  to
    supply a TTD to persons claiming to be Sri Lankan nationals.  TTDs  are
    issued from the DIE in Colombo by email. We  consider  it  more  likely
    than not that the Sri Lankan authorities can distinguish between  those
    described by Ms Jegarajah as "waging the alternative war" and those who
    are not involved with attempts to revive the LTTE in the diaspora.

324. President Rajapaksa has stated,  and  the  press  reports  and  experts
    confirm, that the government has sophisticated intelligence  concerning
    who is contacting the diaspora or seeking to revive  the  quest  for  a
    Tamil homeland.  The government's intelligence includes  monitoring  of
    activities online, on mobile phones, and in the diaspora  in  the  four
    hotspots:   London,  Paris,  Oslo  and  Toronto.   It   has   informers
    throughout the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and in the diaspora.  It
    intercepts electronic and  telephone  communications  and  closes  down
    websites.   Photographs  are  taken  of  demonstrations  and  the  GOSL
    sponsors an image recognition project at Colombo University.

325. It is not established that  previous  LTTE  connections  or  sympathies
    (whether direct or familial), are perceived by the GOSL  as  indicating
    now that an individual poses a destabilising  threat  in  post-conflict
    Sri Lanka; as indicated in the UNCHR Guidelines  and  in  the  evidence
    before us, the extent  to  which  past  links  predict  future  adverse
    interest will always be fact specific, and for those with  close  links
    to the LTTE's operations during the war, the exclusion clauses may well
    be relevant.

326. Many of the witnesses stated that despite official pronouncements  that
    all returning asylum seekers were traitors, the  GOSL  was  aware  that
    many  of  them  were  economic  migrants.   Such  returnees  would   be
    interviewed at the airport and unless it was established that they  had
    significant diaspora activities, were likely to be allowed to  continue
    to their home areas.

Sinhalisation of Tamil areas

327. At the end of the civil war, Tamils were relocated  to  camps,  pending
    reconstruction of the conflict-damaged north  and  east,  and  also  to
    allow for identification of persons requiring  "rehabilitation"  before
    they could rejoin the Sri Lankan community.  The  camps  are  only  now
    being closed, some four years later, but many Tamils  have  lost  their
    businesses and farms to occupying Sinhalese soldiers  and  others  find
    that their homes, farms and  businesses  are  in  high  security  zones
    (HSZs), where there is said to be high levels of  unexploded  ordnance,
    and inaccessible.

328. The former Tamil areas in the Northern and  Eastern  Provinces  are  in
    effect occupied territory, with one soldier for every five  members  of
    the population.  Militarisation is particularly heavy in  the  Northern
    Province.   The  Sri  Lankan  army  budget  and  personnel  have   been
    significantly increased every year and the size of the Sri Lankan  army
    now exceeds that of the United Kingdom.  HSZs have been  designated  to
    which no returns are permissible for the time being  and  many  farmers
    have not yet been able to return to their land.  During the period when
    the camps were operating, the  army  has  run  the  shops,  businesses,
    hotels  and  tourism  in  the  area.   Permanent  barracks  have   been
    constructed  and  substantial  payments  made  available  for  soldiers
    settling in the Northern Province who have at least three children.

329. President Rajapaksa has stated that  these  areas  should  not  now  be
    described as "Tamil areas": the government's intention appears to be to
    dilute the Tamil population of those areas by Sinhalisation.

LLRC

330. In May 2010, the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) established  a  Lessons
    Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), mandated as follows:

       "To inquire and report on the following matters that may have  taken
       place during the period between 21st February, 2002  and  19th  May,
       2009, namely:


       .    The facts and circumstances which led to  the  failure  of  the
       ceasefire agreement operationalized on 21st February, 2002  and  the
       sequence of events that followed thereafter up to the 19th  of  May,
       2009.
       .    Whether any person, group or institution directly or indirectly
       bear responsibility in this regard;
       .    The  lessons  we  would  learn  from  those  events  and  their
       attendant concern,  in  order  to  ensure  that  there  will  be  no
       recurrence;
       .    The methodology whereby restitution to any person  affected  by
       those events or their dependants or their heirs, can be affected;
       .    The institutional administrative and legislative measures which
       need to be taken in order or prevent any recurrence of such concerns
       in the future,  and  to  promote  further  national  unity  and  the
       reconciliation among all communities, and to  make  any  such  other
       recommendations with reference to any of the matters that have  been
       inquired into under the terms of the civil warrant."

331. The LLRC's report was delivered to President Rajapaksa on  15  November
    2011 and made public on 16 December 2011.  Among other recommendations,
    it advocated that Tamil rights to celebrate their culture and  religion
    be guaranteed, that there be equal rights for Tamils, that the military
    be removed immediately from civilian administration in the Northern and
    Eastern Provinces, and that there be religious freedom in Sri Lanka.

332.  The  LLRC  recommendations,  if  implemented,  should  have   led   to
    significant improvements for Tamils in Sri Lanka but as at the date  of
    hearing, many of its recommendations had not yet been implemented.  The
    GOSL's public position was that it had invited the return of the  Tamil
    diaspora to rebuild the Northern Province.  The GOSL's stance  is  that
    it is trying to reconstruct the  Northern  and  Eastern  Provinces  and
    should be given time to do so, but that any  such  reconstruction  does
    not permit recognition of separate Tamil identity at present.

333. There  are  very  few  demonstrations  within  Sri  Lanka:   Mr  Macrae
    described  any  sort  of  political  activity  within  Sri   Lanka   as
    'incredibly dangerous'. The LLRC had recommended that Tamils be allowed
    to celebrate their community  anniversaries  and  Maaveerar  Naal,  the
    Tamil Remembrance Day, was one such.  On  27  November  2011,  when  40
    students in Jaffna lit lamps in celebration of Maaveerar Naal, and many
    students demonstrated, hundreds were arrested.  Most were released, but
    45 students were sent for rehabilitation outside Jaffna and  may  still
    be detained.

334. On 19 March 2013, the UN General Assembly expressed concerns as to  the
    slow implementation of the LLRC recommendations. On March 24 2013,  the
    GOSL stated publicly that it expected to meet  the  General  Assembly's
    deadline for implementation of all LLRC recommendations by March  2014,
    but that seems unlikely to be achieved.

Diaspora activities

335. There are approximately one million  Tamils  outside  Sri  Lanka,  with
    diaspora activity hotspots in London,  Paris,  Oslo  and  Toronto.   In
    2010, the exiled Tamil diaspora held worldwide elections and  there  is
    now what is described as a government in exile, whose  President  lives
    in New York.  In London, there have been  demonstrations  against  both
    the  May  2009  events,  and  against  conditions  in  Sri  Lanka  now.
    President Rajapaksa's visit for the 2012 Olympics was badly affected by
     demonstrations in London when  he  arrived.   The  GOSL  continues  to
    criticise  vigorously  the  perceived  support  by  the   international
    community of Tamil diaspora activism abroad.

336. The former Tamil areas and the diaspora are heavily penetrated  by  the
    security forces. Photographs are taken of public demonstrations and the
    GOSL may be using face recognition technology:  it is sponsoring a face
    recognition technology project at the University of Colombo.   However,
    the question which concerns the GOSL is  the  identification  of  Tamil
    activists working for Tamil separatism and to destabilise  the  unitary
    Sri Lankan state.  We do not consider that attendance at demonstrations
    in the diaspora alone  is  sufficient  to  create  a  real  risk  or  a
    reasonable degree of likelihood that  a  person  will  attract  adverse
    attention on return to Sri Lanka.

337. Nor do we accept Miss Jegarajah's submission that  all  Tamils  are  at
    risk on return; that was not the evidence of any of the witnesses,  nor
    did the UNHCR go so far.  Ms Jananayagam expressly stated that she  was
    not saying that "all Tamils" were  at  risk.   Ms  Jegarajah's  closing
    submissions strayed into evidence in places, particularly  in  relation
    to her assertion that every Tamil  remains  passionately  committed  to
    Tamil separatism or that all Tamils in London and  the  United  Kingdom
    are working to continue the conflict outside  Sri  Lanka  now  that  it
    cannot be continued within the country.

338. Ms Jananayagam made it quite clear that the risk, in her  opinion,  was
    not to "all Tamils" but to certain categories of returning Tamils.   We
    accept that in London there have been demonstrations on important Tamil
    anniversaries and it is clear that among the London Tamil  diaspora  in
    particular, and no doubt also in Paris, Oslo  and  Toronto,  there  are
    committed  Tamil  activists  working  for  Tamil  separatism   and   to
    destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan  state.   The  GOSL  perceives  such
    individuals as continuing to oppose the Sinhalisation of Sri Lanka as a
    whole, and the single state approach enshrined in Amendment 6(1) to the
    Sri Lankan Constitution in 1983,  which  prohibits  the  "violation  of
    territorial integrity" of Sri Lanka.

339. Professor Anthony  Good  told  us  that  the  vast  majority  of  those
    interned had been released, over 40% of the land area in  the  Northern
    Province was now accessible by road,  and  roads,  railways  and  other
    infrastructure projects were under  way.   The  banks  in  Jaffna  were
    reopening.  He confirmed the press reports of disappearances,  some  of
    which were for political reasons, and some for extortion.  The  dreaded
    'white vans' contained  people  in  civilian  clothes,  and  abductions
    occurred in Colombo as well as the  Northern  Province.   It  sometimes
    happened that those so  abducted  later  turned  up  in  the  Terrorist
    Investigation Department's hands but using paramilitaries gave the GOSL
    deniability.

340. The respondent's current  guidance  relies  strongly  on  the  European
    Court of Human Rights decision in E.G.  With the greatest of respect to
    that Court, it was there considering a Tamil whose last  experience  of
    detention was in 1996 and who had not left  the  United  Kingdom  since
    2000.  The evidence before the Court ended in 2010.  The European Court
    of Human Rights in E.G. found that return on a TTD did not seem to make
    any difference to the risk at the airport, which it considered too  low
    to engage international protection.  We agree  that  the  risk  at  the
    airport is low and none of the parties now  contends  that  to  be  the
    principal area of risk, unless a person returned on such a document  is
    on a wanted or watch list.

341. Sri Lanka is no longer a  divided  state,  with  LTTE  areas  to  which
    Tamils can seek to relocate if at risk in the areas controlled  by  the
    GOSL.  The whole of Sri Lanka is now under the  control  of  the  GOSL.
    The Secretary  of  State's  guidance  to  caseworkers,  and  the  UNHCR
    guidelines, both accept that internal relocation will not reduce a risk
    emanating from GOSL state actors, or non-state actors cooperating  with
    the GOSL.

342. 11,000 former LTTE cadres have been through the rehabilitation  process
    and only a handful have relapsed, into ordinary  crime  not  terrorism.
    The risk of LTTE resurgence does not come from within  Sri  Lanka  now.
    There is very little evidence coming out of the  Northern  and  Eastern
    Provinces because of self-censorship by journalists and lack of  access
    for human  rights  bodies  and  other  non-governmental  organisations.
    However, such evidence as there is shows that although the  camps  have
    closed, and infrastructure is being  rebuilt,  that  infrastructure  is
    controlled by the Sri Lankan military forces and many Tamils have  been
    unable to return to their lands and businesses, either because they are
    now in military hands or because they are in HSZs, which are still  out
    of bounds and being de-mined.  There is a dearth of jobs for Tamils who
    were internally displaced and economic conditions are hard.

343. There have been a number of "white van" disappearances, in Colombo  and
    the Northern Province:  some individuals turned up in TID  hands,  some
    were held for ransom, and many have not turned  up  at  all.   Year  on
    year, the number of such disappearances is increasing during the peace,
    rather than decreasing.  The size and budget of the  Sri  Lankan  armed
    forces are also increasing year on year:  there are now one soldier  to
    every five civilians in the Northern Province, and the standing army of
    Sri Lanka is larger than that of the United Kingdom.

344. The only direct evidence of the  opinion  of  Tamils  in  the  Northern
    Province was that of Dr Smith: alone among the expert witnesses, he had
    spoken to individual Tamil farmers and small businessmen in the  Vanni.
    He found them to express caution as to whether the end of the civil war
    was a false dawn of peace, but that what they  really  wanted  was  for
    everything to return to normal.  The civil war has caused enormous loss
    of life and harm to the infrastructure and economic conditions  in  the
    Northern and Eastern Provinces and, after a quarter  of  a  century  of
    conflict, a return to peace is likely to be  the  principal  desire  of
    those living there.

345. Procedures at the airport are more benign than previously.   There  are
    two reasons, the first being that anyone who requires a TTD or  an  ETD
    must apply from the SLHC or Sri Lankan  Consulate  in  the  country  of
    refuge; questions are asked to identify them and  their  families,  and
    whether they had any past LTTE connections.  In practice, all of  those
    who lived in areas where the LTTE was the de  facto  government  during
    certain periods of the civil  war  will  have  LTTE  connections.   The
    information is passed to Colombo, where a decision is made  whether  to
    issue  a  travel  document.   There  exists  a  Bilateral   Readmission
    Agreement between the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka but we have not seen
    it.  The respondent was not prepared to produce it and  so  we  do  not
    know on what terms a person  whom  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  would
    otherwise be reluctant to  accept  back  may  nevertheless  be  granted
    travel documents.

346. The travel documents are not issued in London:   they  are  emailed  to
    the High Commission from Colombo and then a stamp  and  photograph  are
    added here.  Before anyone whose travel documents are out of date  even
    begins to return, the authorities in Colombo have had  the  opportunity
    to establish whether they are of interest and know everything they need
    to know about that individual.

347. There was international criticism of delays at the airport.  These  are
    relatively brief now and there  are  no  detention  facilities  at  the
    airport.  However, those who return are required  to  give  an  address
    (their home address as specified on their national identity  card)  and
    to return and reside there.  Checks are made within a week by  the  Sri
    Lankan authorities at  the  stated  address.  If  the  authorities  are
    interested in a person, they will be picked  up  at  home  not  at  the
    airport, unless they are on a "stop" list held at the airport.  If on a
    "stop" list, they will be interviewed by the TID and that is likely  to
    involve physical abuse engaging international protection.

348. Internal relocation, to Colombo or elsewhere, will not  in  most  cases
    avail an appellant in whom there is adverse interest.  He or  she  will
    be expected to reside at their identity card address.   For  those  who
    come from Colombo, there are no fixed checkpoints and those checkpoints
    which  exist  are  not  computerised.   Attempts  to  revive  a   fixed
    checkpoint at Wellawatte were successfully resisted by the local people
    and were withdrawn.  Colombo is neither more nor  less  safe  than  any
    other part of the single-state Sri Lanka.

349. The rehabilitation process was applied to all  identified  LTTE  cadres
    at the end of the civil war.  That is not its purpose now:  it is  used
    where a person is considered to be involved in possible  resurgence  of
    the  LTTE  or  contacting  the  active  diaspora.   Sri  Lankan  Tamils
    returning from the diaspora who did not undergo  rehabilitation  during
    2009-11 are not for that reason at risk now, unless they can  be  shown
    to come within the risk factors presently identified.

350. The case  of  the  Jaffna  students  arrested  for  lighting  lamps  on
    Maaveerar Naal in November 2011 is not the same as that of students, or
    Tamils generally, who attend public  demonstrations  in  the  diaspora.
    That particular incident reflected a recommendation in the LLRC  report
    that Tamils within Sri Lanka be permitted to celebrate events  such  as
    Maaveerar Naal, Pongu Thamil and Mahaveera.  The Jaffna  students  were
    arrested  and  sent  to  rehabilitation,  in  line  with   the   GOSL's
    Sinhalisation policy in the Northern Province.

351. Our overall conclusion regarding diaspora activities is that  the  GOSL
    has sophisticated intelligence enabling it to distinguish those who are
    actively involved in seeking  to  revive  and  re-fund  the  separatist
    movement within the diaspora, with a view to destabilising the  unitary
    Sri Lankan state.  Attendance at one, or even several demonstrations in
    the diaspora is not of itself evidence that a  person  is  a  committed
    Tamil activist seeking to promote Tamil separatism  within  Sri  Lanka.
    That will be a question of fact in each case, dependent on any diaspora
    activities carried out by such an individual.

352. The evidence before us indicates that any  Tamil  who  seeks  a  travel
    document from the SLHC in London or another diaspora hotspot will  have
    a file created in Colombo and will be interviewed in  London  before  a
    decision is made to issue a TTD.  By the time the DIE in Colombo emails
    a TTD to London to be issued to such  an  individual,  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities will know all they need to know about  what  activities  an
    individual has undertaken outside Sri Lanka and, in particular, whether
    the returnee poses a real risk to the unitary Sri Lankan state  or  the
    GOSL on return.

The LP / TK factors

353. The LP/TK factors now date back almost six years, and  were  formulated
    during the civil war.  There have been real changes, both good and bad,
    in Sri Lanka since the end of the civil war.

354. The LTTE is a spent force within Sri Lanka and considered  unlikely  to
    rise again  from  within  the  unitary  Sri  Lanka,  which  is  tightly
    controlled by the Sri  Lankan  security  forces.   The  perceived  risk
    against which the GOSL works  now  concerns  the  possibility  of  LTTE
    resurgence and efforts to restart the  internal  armed  conflict,  from
    outside Sri Lanka, led by  diaspora  activists.   The  GOSL  no  longer
    relies  principally  on  checkpoints  and  searches;  its  approach  is
    intelligence-led and it has sophisticated, extensive intelligence as to
    those who are seeking to destabilise  the  unitary  state,  within  the
    diaspora and in Sri Lanka itself.

Country guidance

355. As already stated, while the December 2012 UNHCR guidance has  assisted
    us in reaching the conclusions on country guidance  which  we  now  set
    out, we have not heard evidence on all of the categories identified  in
    the guidance and we have heard evidence  from  a  very  wide  range  of
    experts with knowledge of conditions today in  Sri  Lanka.    Professor
    Good and Dr Smith were both asked  to  comment  on  whether  the  LP/TK
    factors continued to be of relevance.  Each  of  them  said  that  they
    were, but offered a list of more current suggestions in addition.

356. Having considered and reviewed all the evidence, including  the  latest
    UNHCR guidance, we consider that the change in the GOSL's  approach  is
    so significant that it is preferable to reframe the risk  analysis  for
    the present political situation in Sri Lanka.  We  give  the  following
    country guidance:

      (1)   This determination replaces all existing country guidance on Sri
      Lanka.

      (2)   The focus of the Sri Lankan  government's  concern  has  changed
      since the civil war ended in May 2009.  The LTTE in Sri  Lanka  itself
      is a spent force and there have been no terrorist incidents since  the
      end of the civil war.

      (3)    The  government's  present  objective  is  to  identify   Tamil
      activists in the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and  to
      destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state enshrined in  Amendment  6(1)
      to the Sri Lankan Constitution in 1983, which prohibits the 'violation
      of territorial integrity' of Sri Lanka.  Its focus  is  on  preventing
      both (a) the resurgence of the LTTE or any  similar  Tamil  separatist
      organisation and (b) the revival of the civil war within Sri Lanka.

      (4)   If a person is detained by  the  Sri  Lankan  security  services
      there  remains  a  real  risk  of  ill-treatment  or  harm   requiring
      international protection.

      (5)    Internal relocation is not an option within  Sri  Lanka  for  a
      person at real  risk  from  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities,  since  the
      government now controls the whole of Sri Lanka and Tamils are required
      to return to a named address after passing through the airport.

      (6)   There are no detention facilities at the  airport.   Only  those
      whose names appear on a "stop" list will be detained from the airport.
       Any risk for those in whom the Sri Lankan authorities are  or  become
      interested exists not at the airport, but after arrival in their  home
      area, where their arrival will be verified by the CID or police within
      a few days.

      (7)   The current categories of persons at real risk of persecution or
      serious  harm  on  return  to  Sri  Lanka,  whether  in  detention  or
      otherwise, are:

           (a)   Individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a  threat  to
           the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because  they  are,
           or are perceived to have a significant role in relation to post-
           conflict Tamil separatism within the diaspora and/or  a  renewal
           of hostilities within Sri Lanka.

           (b)   Journalists (whether in print or  other  media)  or  human
           rights activists, who, in either case, have criticised  the  Sri
           Lankan government, in particular its human rights record, or who
           are associated with publications  critical  of  the  Sri  Lankan
           government.

           (c)   Individuals who have given evidence to the Lessons Learned
           and  Reconciliation  Commission  implicating  the   Sri   Lankan
           security forces, armed forces or the Sri Lankan  authorities  in
           alleged war crimes.  Among those  who  may  have  witnessed  war
           crimes during the conflict, particularly in the No-Fire Zones in
           May 2009, only those who have already identified  themselves  by
           giving  such  evidence  would  be  known  to  the   Sri   Lankan
           authorities and therefore only they are at real risk of  adverse
           attention or persecution on return as potential  or  actual  war
           crimes witnesses.

           (d)   A person whose name appears on a computerised "stop"  list
           accessible at the airport, comprising a list  of  those  against
           whom  there  is  an  extant  court  order  or  arrest   warrant.
           Individuals whose name appears on a "stop" list will be  stopped
           at the airport and handed over to  the  appropriate  Sri  Lankan
           authorities, in pursuance of such order or warrant.

    (8)    The Sri Lankan authorities' approach is based  on  sophisticated
    intelligence, both as  to  activities  within  Sri  Lanka  and  in  the
    diaspora.  The Sri Lankan authorities know that many Sri Lankan  Tamils
    travelled abroad as economic migrants and also  that  everyone  in  the
    Northern Province had some level of involvement with  the  LTTE  during
    the civil war.   In  post-conflict  Sri  Lanka,  an  individual's  past
    history will be relevant only to the extent that it is perceived by the
    Sri Lankan authorities as indicating a present risk to the unitary  Sri
    Lankan state or the Sri Lankan Government.

    (9)    The authorities maintain a computerised intelligence-led "watch"
    list. A person whose name appears on a "watch" list is  not  reasonably
    likely to be detained at the airport  but  will  be  monitored  by  the
    security services after his or her return. If that monitoring does  not
    indicate that such a person is a Tamil activist working to  destabilise
    the unitary Sri Lankan state or revive the internal armed conflict, the
    individual in question is not, in  general,  reasonably  likely  to  be
    detained by the security forces.  That will be a question  of  fact  in
    each case, dependent on any diaspora activities carried out by such  an
    individual.

    (10)   Consideration must always be given to whether, in the  light  of
    an individual's activities and responsibilities during the  civil  war,
    the exclusion clauses are engaged (Article 1F of the Refugee Convention
    and Article 12(2) of the Qualification Directive).   Regard  should  be
    had to the  categories  for  exclusion  set  out  in  the  "Eligibility
    Guidelines For Assessing the International Protection Needs of  Asylum-
    Seekers from Sri Lanka", published by UNHCR on 21 December 2012.

Determination of the individual appeals

357. We  turn,  therefore,  to  consider  the  position  of  the  individual
    appellants in the light of our guidance. In each case, we set  out  the
    agreed questions, the facts and any evidence received, submissions  and
    conclusions.

The first appellant

358. The agreed issues in relation to the first appellant  were  whether  he
    had been ill-treated in the past, and if so, by whom; and in the  light
    of the  answer  to  that  question,  whether  there  was  any  risk  of
    persecution or serious harm if he were returned now.

Facts for the first appellant

359. The first appellant is a Sri Lankan national of  Tamil  ethnicity  born
    in Kilinochchi in the area of Vanni in 1986. He has  2  elder  sisters,
    one of whom joined the LTTE in 1998. She was a  qualified  LTTE  doctor
    and joined Prabhakaran's personal medical team around  May  2007.   The
    first appellant agreed to join the LTTE in March 2007.  He  received  1
    month's  arms  training  and  15  days'  financial  training.  He   was
    thereafter based at Kilinochchi LTTE camp. He was later assigned to the
    LTTE's finance wing at the  LTTE's  headquarters  in  Kilinochchi.  The
    first appellant was subsequently  put  in  charge  of  a  section  that
    provided diesel and oil to the LTTE fighting units.

360.  In  July  2008,  he  was  ordered  to  the  frontline  and  given  the
    responsibility of supervising the digging of  bunkers  on  the  "Second
    Line".  On 14 November 2008, during a battle at  the  western  side  of
    Muhamalai, the first appellant, amongst others, was cut  off  from  the
    LTTE areas by the Sri Lankan military.  He followed the general public,
    who were moving into an army  stronghold  area.  Over  the  three  days
    following his arrival in the army area, the  army  split  the  arrivals
    into three groups, one group being those the army knew or suspected  to
    be associated with the LTTE. The first appellant, along with  16  other
    bunker digging supervisors, was separated from the public and taken  to
    Kodikamam Police Station.  Whilst there, he admitted to the CID that he
    had been forcibly recruited  into  the  LTTE.  He  was  not  physically
    assaulted whilst at the police station.

361. On 17 November 2008, the first appellant was transferred to a  camp  at
    Kopay, Jaffna. He was detained in this camp until the 28 October  2009.
    In February 2009 he was contacted by the Red  Cross,  who  located  his
    mother and one of sisters in Vavuniya camp. He was questioned  3  times
    by the CID whilst in the camp but was not physically ill treated whilst
    there.

362. Upon being released from Kopay  camp,  the  first  appellant  signed  a
    release letter, which was typed in English  and  interpreted  into  the
    Tamil language. This letter contained details of the dates on which the
    appellant was detained and released.

363. Between November 2009 and March 2010,  the  first  appellant  lived  in
    Vavuniya with his mother, without any further difficulty.  He  returned
    to Kilinochchi, with permission, in April 2010 and was issued  with  an
    identity card in May 2010.

364. From 2010-2012, the first appellant was repeatedly  questioned  by  the
    CID, whose questioning was focused on his previous role  for  the  LTTE
    and that of his sister.  Their suspicions were not allayed  but  rather
    increased over time:

    (i)          In June 2010, he was ordered to attend  the  CID  base  in
    Akkerayankulam.  He  was  questioned  about  the  whereabouts  of  fuel
    canisters and similar items which the LTTE had allegedly buried in  the
    area. He was not ill treated;

    (ii)   In October 2010, the first appellant was again  ordered  to  the
    CID base, and questioned about his sister's whereabouts.  It  was  also
    suggested on this occasion that he had been continuing  to  assist  the
    LTTE by collecting funds. He was not physically  ill  treated  but  was
    threatened with being shot;

    (iii)  On 5 December 2010, 15 soldiers entered  the  first  appellant's
    house and took his mobile phone;

    (iv)   In January 2011,  soldiers  came  to  his  house  and  took  his
    details;

    (v)    On 29 May 2012, the first appellant was arrested from  his  home
    and taken to  the  CID  base  at  Akkerayankulam.  This  time,  he  was
    detained;

    (vi)   On 30 May 2012, the appellant was transferred to the  army  camp
    at Kilinochchi.  He was detained for three days, during which  time  he
    was ill treated, questioned about his  sister's  LTTE  involvement  and
    accused of supporting the LTTE.

365. The first appellant was released on 1 June  2011  after  payment  of  a
    substantial bribe. He left Sri  Lanka  via  Colombo  airport  two  days
    later, with the assistance of an agent, using a passport  obtained  for
    him by the agent before his arrest. He then travelled  via  Nairobi  to
    the United Kingdom, arriving here on 27 June 2011 in possession  of  an
    Indian passport. He claimed asylum on arrival.

366. Since his arrival in the United Kingdom, the first appellant has  taken
    part in protest marches against the GOSL organised by the  Tamil  Youth
    Organisation and the British Tamil Forum, both of which the Sri  Lankan
    authorities regard as LTTE front organisations.  He  also  demonstrated
    on Pall Mall during the Sri Lankan President's lunch with the Queen  in
    2012.

367. The first appellant has not lost contact with his family:  he spoke  to
    his mother after coming to the United Kingdom and  she  told  him  that
    since his departure the CID have visited the family house  looking  for
    him and his sister, that they threatened his mother and  asked  whether
    the first appellant was still working for the LTTE finance wing.

Respondent's decision

368. The Secretary of State refused the first appellant leave  to  enter  by
    way of a decision dated the 30 October 2011. In the letter  of  refusal
    which accompanied that decision,  she  concluded  that,  save  for  the
    evidence given by the first appellant as to his name  and  nationality,
    he  had  fabricated  his  evidence.  In  particular  she  rejected   as
    implausible the following parts of his account:

      . That the LTTE, when recruiting the first appellant at his  shop  in
        2007, did not also seek to recruit the fourteen  other  persons  in
        the shop at the same time;

      . That the appellant received only 1 month's training from the  LTTE,
        which the respondent considered to be inconsistent with  background
        evidence indicating that LTTE members  at  that  time  underwent  a
        rigorous 4-month training regime;

      . That the first appellant did not seek to flee from the LTTE in  the
        3-hour period between the time he was informed by the LTTE of their
        intention to recruit him, and the time he was taken by them;

      . That the first appellant  would  have  been  supervising  civilians
        digging bunkers whilst unarmed and not wearing an LTTE uniform;

      . That the first appellant experienced no  difficulties  leaving  Sri
        Lanka, which if true indicated that he was of no  interest  to  the
        authorities at that time.

369. The respondent also considered  that  the  first  appellant  had  given
    inconsistent evidence as to the  contents  of  the  document  which  he
    asserted he had been required to sign upon his release from Kopay  Army
    Camp in 2009.

First-tier Tribunal's decision

370. The first appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.  His  appeal
    was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Stott,  and  dismissed  on  all
    grounds in a  determination  prepared  on  the  2  February  2012.  The
    following paragraphs of Judge Stott's determination are  of  particular
    relevance:

      "[17] I am prepared to accept that the appellant has been detained  by
      the Sri Lankan authorities from November 2008 until  October  2009  in
      the Kopay Camp in Jaffna. During that period I also  accept  that  the
      Red Cross were contacted who located the appellant's  mother  and  the
      younger of his two sisters. It is not suggested however  that  despite
      being held for almost twelve months that there was any  ill  treatment
      of the appellant. This would suggest that during that time he was  not
      regarded as having been an active belligerent. It is also of note that
      he was given a release letter which from its terminology, described by
      the appellant during the course of his interview, simply detailed  the
      dates when he was taken to the camp and his release. I do  not  accept
      that it contained further  details  regarding  him  having  to  remain
      within a particular locality as the appellant had the  opportunity  to
      give those details on interview (see questions 169  and  170)  of  the
      interview record.

      [18] It  is  also  apparent  from  the  appellant's  version  that  he
      initially lived with his relatives in Vavuniya before returning to his
      home area of Kilinochchi in April 2010. He experienced no difficulties
      although he was questioned by the police in June and October 2010.  It
      is not suggested that the questioning was conducted with  violence  or
      torture. ...

      [23] In relation to the appellant's witness I have great  reservations
      regarding his credibility. As indicated there were  conflicts  in  the
      evidence given about the fashion, the manner and timing of the contact
      between him and the appellant. It is also apparent that he has  become
      friendly with an individual working for the instructing solicitors and
      has been informed of the appellant's background. Although  he  himself
      has sought asylum on the basis of his involvement with  the  LTTE  his
      dubious  credibility  casts  doubt  upon  his  claims  regarding   his
      relationship with the appellant's  sister  and  her  position  in  the
      organisation.

      [24] In view of my findings I do not believe that the appellant is  at
      risk from the Sri Lankan authorities upon his  return.  I  accept  the
      conclusion of the medical report that the appellant has been  tortured
      but in view of the appellant being able to leave the country using his
      won passport despite having been detained in 2008 and having  effected
      his escape by bribery I do not believe that there  remains  a  serious
      risk to him on return"

Error of Law

371. The first appellant was granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers, in a decision dated  23
    February 2012.

372. Permission to  appeal  was  granted,  inter  alia,  because  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Chambers considered it arguable that  the  reasoning  in
    the First-tier Tribunal's determination was defective, since the  judge
    had overlooked consideration of photographs of the  appellant  in  LTTE
    uniform, including photographs of his sister with  Prabhakaran's  body.
    Judge Chambers considered also that the determination  failed  to  take
    proper account of the existing country guidance.

373. The respondent in her rule 24  notice  dated  20  March  2012  did  not
    oppose the appeal and invited the Upper Tribunal to consider the matter
    afresh.

374. On 1 May 2012 Upper Tribunal  Judge  Hanson  found  that  there  was  a
    material error of  law  in  the  determination  and  ordered  that  the
    decision be remade by the Upper Tribunal at  a  hearing.   He  directed
    that:

        "... a.  The parties shall prepare for the  hearing  on  the  basis
        that the findings of fact of the First-tier Tribunal at  paragraphs
        17, 18 and 23 (but  not  in  relation  to  the  alleged  friendship
        between the witness and the member of the  staff  employed  by  the
        appellant's solicitors) shall stand."

The preserved findings

375. The findings of fact from the First-tier Tribunal  which  Judge  Hanson
    ordered preserved were as follows:


        "[17] I am prepared to accept that the appellant has been  detained
        by the Sri Lankan authorities from November 2008 until October 2009
        in the Kopay Camp in Jaffna. During that period I also accept  that
        the Red Cross were contacted who located the appellant's mother and
        the younger of his two sisters. It is not  suggested  however  that
        despite being held for almost twelve months that there was any  ill
        treatment of the appellant. This would  suggest  that  during  that
        time he was not regarded as having been an active  belligerent.  It
        is also of note that he was given a release letter which  from  its
        terminology, described by the appellant during the  course  of  his
        interview, simply detailed the dates when he was taken to the  camp
        and his release. I do not accept that it contained further  details
        regarding him having to remain within a particular locality as  the
        appellant had the opportunity to give those  details  on  interview
        (see questions 169 and 170) of the interview record.


        [18] It is also apparent  from  the  appellant's  version  that  he
        initially lived with his relatives in Vavuniya before returning  to
        his home area of Kilinochchi  in  April  2010.  He  experienced  no
        difficulties although he was questioned by the police in  June  and
        October  2010.  It  is  not  suggested  that  the  questioning  was
        conducted with violence or torture ...


        [23]  In  relation  to  the  appellant's  witness  I   have   great
        reservations regarding his credibility.  As  indicated  there  were
        conflicts in the evidence given about the fashion, the  manner  and
        timing of the contact between him and the  appellant.  It  is  also
        apparent that he has become friendly with an individual working for
        the instructing solicitors and has been informed of the appellant's
        background. Although he himself has sought asylum on the  basis  of
        his involvement with the LTTE his dubious credibility  casts  doubt
        upon his claims regarding his  relationship  with  the  appellant's
        sister and her position in the organisation.


        [24] In view of my findings I do not believe that the appellant  is
        at risk from the Sri Lankan authorities upon his return.  I  accept
        the conclusion of the medical report that the  appellant  has  been
        tortured but in view of the  appellant  being  able  to  leave  the
        country using his own passport despite having been detained in 2008
        and having effected his escape by bribery I  do  not  believe  that
        there remains a serious risk to  him  on  return."        [Emphasis
        added]

Evidence before Upper Tribunal

376.  The  first  appellant  gave  additional  evidence  before  the   Upper
    Tribunal,  on  two  occasions.  On  the  first  occasion,  there   were
    substantial difficulties in comprehension between the  first  appellant
    and the Tamil interpreter. It was agreed by the parties,  and  accepted
    by the tribunal, that the evidence given by the first appellant on this
    occasion should be  disregarded.  On  the  second  occasion  the  first
    appellant  gave  evidence,  there  were  no  such  difficulties.    The
    following is a summary of the evidence we received in written form, and
    on the second occasion:

   a) The first appellant adopted a lengthy witness statement drawn  in  his
      name and dated 11 February 2013, which stated, in summary,  that;  (i)
      he had not been abducted by the LTTE in March  2007  and  his  earlier
      statement to the contrary contains error in this regard, this being as
      the likely consequence of a  mistranslation,  (ii)  only  one  of  his
      sisters joined the LTTE,  and  the  statement  in  the  expert  report
      authored by Dr Smith that both of his sisters had joined the LTTE  was
      incorrect; (iii) the original documents, copies of which are  provided
      between pages 79 to 96 of his bundle, are genuine; (iv)  the  original
      photograph of him in LTTE uniform was not before the Tribunal  because
      he handed it to his previous solicitors who had not returned  it;  and
      that (v) the photograph was taken in Kilinochchi  in  2007  after  the
      funeral of an LTTE hero.

   b) The first appellant also gave detailed evidence as to the contents  of
      other photographs before the tribunal, identifying the LTTE  personnel
      contained  within  the   photographs,   including   his   sister   and
      Prabhakaran, the now deceased  former  leader  of  the  LTTE.  Further
      evidence was also given by the first appellant to the effect that; (i)
      he had voluntarily joined the LTTE, having been asked to do  so;  (ii)
      his training for the LTTE  had  lasted  1  �  months,  of  which  arms
      training constituted 1 month and training in  LTTE  financial  affairs
      lasted 15 day. After  training  he  was  transferred  to  the  finance
      division and then worked in the fuel distribution section.

377. Under cross-examination from Mr Hall,  the  first  appellant  confirmed
    that:

   c) He had joined the LTTE in 2007 as a volunteer, after they came to  his
      shop and asked him to do so.  The LTTE had given him  three  hours  to
      decide whether to join:  whilst he would not have joined  had  he  not
      been asked, the appellant was aware that  had  he  not  done  so,  his
      refusal would have been very embarrassing for his sister,  because  of
      her high profile in the LTTE.  The first appellant repeated  that  his
      sister had been a doctor and a part of Prabhakaran's medical team.

   d) The LTTE's fuel and diesel was obtained from foreign countries and the
      army-controlled areas. The distribution section was in Kilinochchi and
      that was where the appellant worked. He played no part  in  purchasing
      the fuel; his job was to see that it reached the various places  where
      it was needed and that proper accounts were kept.

   e) Of the seventeen persons working with him in the LTTE, he was aware of
      three who had been taken for questioning by the Sri Lankan authorities
      and who never returned.

   f) The first appellant stated that he had not signed a confession  whilst
      detained in Kopay camp.

   g) As to his travel arrangements out of Sri Lanka,  the  first  appellant
      had not asked questions. The agent had obtained a passport for him and
      had retained it.   His  uncle  had  arranged  the  agent:   the  first
      appellant had not asked his uncle how much he had paid the agent.  His
      uncle owns a shop selling  agricultural  products,  and  has  2  adult
      children.

   h) The appellant was asked for further detail of  his  relationship  with
      the agent.  His evidence was that his uncle had spoken  to  the  agent
      after the first appellant's arrest. He  stated  that  he  communicated
      with the agent only through the uncle, but when it was put to him that
      this was not consistent with his earlier evidence, the first appellant
      asserted that his uncle had introduced him to the agent  and  that  he
      had communicated with the agent  principally  through  his  uncle.  He
      assumed that the agent knew a CID officer and that was how his release
      had been arranged.

   i) When "released", the appellant had been taken, by a CID officer, to an
      area about 200 metres outside the Kilinochchi camp where he was  held.
      His uncle and the agent were waiting for him in a car. He had left the
      camp "through a back door".

   j)       Whilst in detention he had been asked questions about  the  LTTE
      finance section, and persons who had contact with the section. He  was
      tortured and asked questions in a dark room.

   k) His fingerprints were not taken during the  2011  detention,  but  his
      photograph was taken.  He was not provided with a release document  on
      this occasion. He had not thought of asking the agent whether he would
      be recorded as an escapee. He had not asked the agent any questions.

   l) He was now on a list of people to be killed.


Re-making the determination: the issues

378. There is a clear  finding  in  the  preserved  paragraph  24  that  the
    appellant was tortured.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge expressly  found
    that the torture had not occurred in the original detention  or  during
    the police questioning of the appellant in June and  October  2010;  he
    also disbelieved the account of a further three day  detention  between
    29 May and 1 June 2011, during which the appellant  said  he  had  been
    tortured.  It was unclear when the First-tier Tribunal Judge considered
    that the torture had occurred.

379. The appellant's account was that by June 2011, the authorities knew  of
    his connection with his sister and that she was a senior member of  the
    LTTE, whom they believed to be one of those seeking  to  resurrect  the
    LTTE and restart the conflict; that they tortured him to find out where
    she was; and that he was released after three days since his family had
    discovered his whereabouts and paid a bribe.  The  appellant's  account
    was that the agent who arranged his journey obtained an Indian passport
    bearing the appellant's photograph, and he left the  country  two  days
    later, flying from Colombo airport.

380. Those are the findings affected by the error of law and upon which  the
    Upper Tribunal must make fresh findings now.

Submissions

381. For the respondent, Mr Hall accepted that this  appellant  had  been  a
    low level member of the LTTE, involved in the distribution of fuel.

382. He did not seek to go behind the preserved findings of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the appellant was  detained  in  Kopay  camp  as  claimed
    between November 2008 and October 2009 and that, after his release from
    this detention, he initially lived in Vavuniya with his mother and then
    returned to live in Kilinochchi in April 2010.  He  accepted  that  the
    appellant was questioned by the police  on  numerous  occasions  whilst
    living in Kilinochchi, but was not physically ill-treated  during  such
    questioning, although he was threatened with ill-treatment.

383. Dealing with the appellant's account of his  release  and  escape  from
    Sri Lanka, with the help of an agent paid for by his shopkeeper  uncle,
    and his claim for the first time in evidence before us that he was on a
    "kill" list, Mr Hall  asked  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  find  the  final
    detention in 2011 to be an embellishment.  The appellant's  account  of
    being arrested and tortured by  the  authorities  after  an  uneventful
    series of visits by them should not be accepted as credible.

384. The appellant claimed to have travelled out of Sri Lanka in  June  2011
    on a passport which the agent had obtained for him  in  December  2010,
    months before his last claimed arrest.  The appellant's  oral  evidence
    as to whether he had spoken to the agent prior to his detention in 2011
    was inconsistent with his written account. In addition, the appellant's
    new evidence that he had been told he was on a list to be shot,  should
    be dismissed as fabrication to bolster his claim.  No such evidence had
    been given previously.

385. As to diaspora activities, even if the  appellant  had  taken  part  in
    demonstrations in the United Kingdom, as claimed, there was nothing  to
    suggest that the Sri Lankan authorities were aware of  that  and  would
    associate him with the resurgence of the LTTE in the diaspora.  He  had
    no diaspora contacts when working for the LTTE, had done nothing  after
    his  release  in  2009  to  raise  his  profile  in  the  eyes  of  the
    authorities, and his sister's record as one of Prabhakaran's doctors in
    the LTTE was not enough to put the appellant at risk now.

386. In submissions made on behalf of the first appellant, Mr Palmer  argued
    that the Tribunal ought not to consider itself  bound  by  the  factual
    findings of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Hanson;  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination  at  paragraph  18  was  factually  erroneous   and   was
    inadequately reasoned at paragraph 23. The error of law  decision  made
    no reference to the unchallenged finding  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination that this appellant had been tortured.

387. The  Tribunal  was  invited  to  find  the  first  appellant's  account
    credible in its entirety: his account had  remained  highly  consistent
    throughout, both  internally  and  with  the  background  evidence,  in
    particular that relating to bribery as a means of facilitating  release
    from detention, exit procedures at Colombo airport and the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities' monitoring by of family members.

388. The credibility points raised by Mr  Hall  were  not  critical  to  the
    appellant's account overall:  the Tribunal should find that it was  not
    credible that the agent would have disclosed any material facts to  the
    appellant given the likelihood  that  the  agent  worked  for  a  "very
    serious criminal organisation";  the appellant's very  late  disclosure
    that he was on a list of those to be shot, ought not  to  detract  from
    his  appellant's credibility, since it often happened in asylum appeals
    that parts of the account were disclosed late.  Even if  that  part  of
    the account were fabricated, the rest of the account should be  treated
    as credible. Mr Hall had accepted that there was a real risk of torture
    in detention, which was fully supported in the country evidence.

389. The appellant relied on the reports from Professor Gunaratna,  who  was
    satisfied that the appellant was  an  LTTE  cadre  who  worked  in  the
    Finance Wing as claimed. Professor Gunaratna had been  responsible  for
    debriefing LTTE members, and having designed  and  worked  on  the  Sri
    Lankan government's rehabilitation programme, was  able  to  provide  a
    "very good indication of the perception of the SL authorities".

Conclusions on the first appellant's appeal

390. The challenges in the respondent's letter  of  refusal  relate  mainly,
    although not entirely, to  elements  of  the  account  now  either  the
    subject of  the  preserved  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  or
    accepted by the respondent to be true. As detailed above, Mr  Hall  for
    the respondent accepted the appellant's account of his role in the LTTE
    finance section and fuel distribution, the Kopay camp detention in 2008-
    2009, his release to live with his mother, his return to Kilinochchi in
    April 2010 and his questioning  while  in  Kilinochchi  by  the  police
    (without ill-treatment) on numerous occasions.  He accepted that during
    that questioning the appellant was threatened with ill  treatment.   He
    continued  to  dispute  the  2011  detention,  the  torture  which  the
    appellant claimed to have  suffered  during  that  detention,  and  the
    circumstances of the appellant's exit from Sri Lanka.

391. We are satisfied to the lower standard that the  2011  events  occurred
    as claimed.   We  have  given  weight  to  the  evidence  of  Professor
    Gunaratna,  although  he  was  not  tendered  for  cross   examination.
    Professor Gunaratna's report largely goes to corroborate those parts of
    the appellant's evidence which have, in any event, now  been  accepted.
    His evidence also supports the appellant's account of his sister  being
    a personal doctor to Prabhakaran, the late founder and  leader  of  the
    LTTE.

392. We do  not  consider  that  the  authorities'  failure  to  arrest  the
    appellant between 2010 and 2011 indicates that they did not arrest  and
    detain him in May 2011.  It is entirely possible that their information
    improved during that period to the extent that they  became  interested
    in him, alternatively, that some other matter of interest had arisen in
    which they considered he might have information.

393. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had
    been tortured, and although that finding is not one of those  expressly
    preserved by Judge Hanson, after considering  the  medical  report  for
    ourselves, in the context of the evidence as a  whole,  we  accept  the
    account of torture.  Dr Arnold's medico-legal report is prepared to the
    Istanbul  Protocol  standard  and  is  strongly   supportive   of   the
    appellant's account of torture during his last detention.

394. The principal challenge remaining is  to  the  appellant's  ability  to
    travel through Colombo airport unhindered, if he were  of  interest  to
    the Sri Lankan authorities as claimed.  Given the substantial sum  paid
    to the agent and the evidence before us on the  pervasive  bribery  and
    corruption in Sri Lanka, applying the lower standard,  we  accept  this
    element of the appellant's account. The appellant's uncle arranged  the
    agent and paid for his services.  The appellant was entitled simply  to
    trust his uncle. We accept  as  credible  that  the  agent  obtained  a
    passport in December 2010 which remained unused by the appellant in May
    2011, on which he was able to leave Sri  Lanka.   We  accept  that  the
    appellant asked no questions of the agent.

395. When looked at as a whole we find the respondent's  challenges  to  the
    credibility of this appellant's evidence to  be  of  little  substance,
    save for the late disclosure that he had been informed that he was on a
    list to be shot. No satisfactory explanation has been provided  by  the
    appellant as to why he failed  to  mention  that  until  he  was  cross
    examined before the Upper Tribunal. His  evidence  was  consistent  and
    generally credible.  We  accept  all  of  the  appellant's  account  as
    credible, save in respect of that late embellishment, which we  do  not
    accept.

396.  Given  the  close  connections  the  appellant's   family   had   with
    Prabhakaran, and his irregular exit from Sri Lanka,  we  are  satisfied
    that he is a person with what the UNHCR Guidelines  describe  as  "more
    elaborate links with the LTTE" and that there remains a real risk  that
    he would be of interest on return.  In order to obtain a TTD he will be
    required to complete a form,  provide  full  details  of  his  previous
    addresses and family members in Sri Lanka,  and  attend  an  interview.
    When he arrives in Sri Lanka the authorities will know everything  they
    need to know about him.

397. The authorities within Sri Lankan have  knowledge  of  the  appellant's
    previous role within the LTTE,  and  in  particularly  his  significant
    involvement in the LTTE's finance  wing  and  its  fuel  supply.  This,
    coupled with his sister's close connections to the former leader of the
    LTTE, his pro-Tamil separatism activities in the  United  Kingdom,  and
    the nature of the enquiry made by the Sri Lankan authorities  with  the
    appellant's family since his departure from his homeland, leads  us  to
    conclude that it is reasonably likely that the Sri  Lankan  authorities
    perceive the appellant as having a significant role in relation to post-
    conflict Tamil separatism within the diaspora.

398. The first appellant's appeal is therefore  allowed  on  asylum  grounds
    and under Article 3 ECHR.  No separate  Article  8  ECHR  argument  was
    advanced. He is not entitled to the grant of  humanitarian  protection.
    No exclusion point has been taken by the respondent under Article 1F of
    the Refugee Convention or Article 12(2) of the Qualification Directive.



The second appellant

399. The agreed question to be answered in relation to the second  appellant
    was whether he would face a real risk of persecution or serious harm in
    Sri Lanka, on the basis that his previous detention would become  known
    to the authorities.  The findings of fact in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    were that in May 2011 the appellant was a 24 year old Sri Lankan Tamil,
    originally from Jaffna.  In 1996, he and his family had been forced  to
    relocate to Puthukudyiruppu, where the LTTE allotted them some land and
    building materials for a house.  He received some  education  and  then
    went to work with his father, making wattle fences  from  coconut  palm
    fronds.  After two years, he was employed by the  LTTE  at  the  Pallai
    checkpoint.  He was paid, and provided with  meals  and  accommodation.
    His  family  remained  in  Puthukudyiruppu,  and  in  2002,  after  the
    ceasefire, the appellant went back to join them.

400. The ceasefire ended and the civil war broke out again  in  2006.   This
    time it was the appellant's brother who was recruited by the LTTE.   He
    was never seen again and  the  family  believed  he  had  died  in  the
    fighting.  In September 2008, the appellant was forcibly  recruited  by
    the LTTE, working on bunker digging and transporting the  wounded.   He
    continued with this work until the end of the civil  war  in  May  2009
    (the First-tier Tribunal Judge's determination  refers  erroneously  to
    2008).

401. The appellant surrendered to the army at Chettikulam,  initially  as  a
    civilian but was rapidly identified as an LTTE cadre. The  army  passed
    the appellant to the CID.  He was taken to another camp (Anuradhapura),
    where he was detained with sixteen others for over  three  months.   He
    was not given enough to eat and made to kneel on the floor for hours at
    a time.  He was mistreated, interrogated, beaten and tortured.  He  was
    burned with lighted cigarettes and beaten  with  metal  rods.   He  was
    beaten with a rifle butt, resulting in a lump on the bone of his  right
    shoulder.  He signed a document in the Sinhala language, a language  he
    is unable to read, and was unsure what it was. The  appellant  provided
    no medical evidence of any scarring.

402. The appellant's father managed to locate him on a list of  IDPs.   Once
    he had the name of the camp, a bribe was paid  by  his  paternal  uncle
    (who had a shoemaking business and  was  relatively  wealthy)  and  the
    appellant was released on 30 August 2009.  He  was  taken  to  Colombo,
    where he spent two weeks before leaving Sri Lanka, via  Dubai,  Turkey,
    and Portugal, arriving in the United Kingdom over  a  year  later.   An
    agent dealt with the journey and organised the timing.  Thirteen months
    were spent in Portugal, waiting for the right moment to  travel  on  to
    the United  Kingdom.  His  uncle  was  still  paying  the  agent.   The
    appellant was told to wait to make his claim until he got to the United
    Kingdom.

403. The appellant kept in contact with  his  family  once  he  reached  the
    United Kingdom.  They were back in  Jaffna,  but  under  suspicion.   A
    cousin of his father's was still in detention in a prison for high-risk
    LTTE personnel.   The  authorities  had  visited  the  family  home  in
    September 2010, according to the appellant's mother; they asked to  see
    the family's ration cards.  The appellant's name was crossed out:  they
    wanted to know where he was but she stated that he  was  still  in  the
    camps.  They knew he was not and said that his mother "had better  find
    [the  appellant]".  The  authorities  were  therefore  aware  that  the
    appellant was missing and he would be at risk if returned to Sri Lanka.



404. When setting aside the First-tier  Tribunal  determination,  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Upper Tribunal Judges McGeachy and King) expressly  preserved
    the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  with  regard  to  the
    credibility of the appellant's claim.  They considered  it  appropriate
    that the appeal proceed to a further hearing to  consider  evidence  on
    whether or not the appellant would face detention or  ill-treatment  on
    return on the basis that  his  detention  would  become  known  to  the
    authorities.

405. The error of law identified was that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had
    erred in his approach to whether the appellant's detention would  bring
    him to adverse attention on return and if so, whether that would create
    a real risk of persecution or serious harm to him now.

Second appellant's evidence at the hearing

406. The appellant produced a second  witness  statement  dated  7  December
    2011 which appears to have been prepared in anticipation of  the  error
    of law hearing. In this he states:

    (i)    His family has moved to a different address because intelligence
    people kept looking for him.

    (ii)   His mother informed him they have come  looking  for  him  three
    times since the hearing in May 2011. She went to the Grama Sevaka about
    this and she has sworn an affidavit  before  a  local  Justice  of  the
    Peace.

    (iii)  The Grama Sevaka and  lawyer  both  told  his  mother  that  the
    appellant should not return to Sri Lanka as the authorities  are  still
    looking for him and it is not safe there. They also advised his  mother
    that the family should move away from the area and so they have done so
    to a place about five  to  six  kilometres  away  from  their  previous
    address. They do not have the resources to move far away.  So  long  as
    the authorities do not know that they are there it is  safe  for  them.
    His parents are particularly worried  about  his  sisters  and  younger
    brother.

407. The second appellant produced a sworn affidavit dated 30 November  2011
    from his mother, which restates the facts asserted  by  the  appellant,
    and provides the following additional information:

           (i)   She has three daughters and three sons.
           (ii)  Her husband's brother secured the release  of  the  second
           appellant on 30 August 2009 after paying "a huge bribe" to  some
           "high officials".
           (iii) Her other son was forcibly  recruited  into  the  LTTE  in
           January 2008 and has been missing since the end of the civil war
           in May 2009.
           (iv)  The Sri Lankan state security and  paramilitary  personnel
           have come to her home on three occasions in search of the second
           appellant since 3 July 2011. They told  the  appellant's  mother
           that he was accused of being an LTTE member, that he had escaped
           from detention and is wanted for further questioning. The  state
           security officials who came to search for him  on  3  July  2011
           were very abusive; they harassed and threatened her. Two were in
           camouflage dress and the others were in plainclothes. A  few  of
           them were armed and had walkie-talkies.
           (v)   On  27  July  2011,  eight  men  came  in  search  of  the
           appellant, three in army fatigues and  the  others  in  civilian
           clothes. Again, a few of them were armed and had walkie-talkies.
           They were more abusive and very rude. They  took  a  few  photos
           from  her  photograph  album,  including  one  of   the   second
           appellant, and required her to report to the  neighbouring  army
           camp on 30 July 2011.
           (vii)       The second appellant's mother reported as  required.
           After a long wait, three officers in "partial" military  uniform
           came.  One spoke to her in fluent  Tamil,  accusing  the  second
           appellant of being a hardcore LTTE member and jail breaker. They
           questioned her about his whereabouts  and  were  very  rude  and
           threatening.
           (viii)       Thereafter  the  second  appellant's  mother  again
           consulted the Grama Sevaka and instructed a lawyer, Mr  Sherosan
           Kumar.

408. Mr Sherosan Kumar (LLB) provided a "To  whom  it  may  concern"  letter
    dated 5 December 2011, confirming that the  second  appellant's  mother
    had contacted him at the  end  of  July  2011  for  legal  advice.  The
    letterhead is of an address in Colombo. His letter continued:

           "...Having made few enquiries into the reasons behind Sri Lankan
           authorities' interest in [the second appellant] can confirm that
           [he] was detained by the  state  security  forces  from  May  to
           August 2009 or was involved with the  LTTE.  His  mother  claims
           that her son was tortured and was forced  to  sign  a  Sinhalese
           document  which  would  eventually  be  fabricated  as  a  self-
           confession. However, [the second appellant was  released]  after
           having paid a hefty bribe to some senior government officials. I
           further understand that  the  Sri  Lankan  security  forces  are
           highly interested in him for further questioning and  have  gone
           twice in July this year to his parents' house ... in  search  of
           him ... I believe that since [he] was  not  released  officially
           the authorities could have listed him as an escapee  from  their
           custody and might have alerted the ports of entry exit."

409. Mr Kumar then states that he is in active practice as  an  attorney  at
    law in the Supreme Court of Sri  Lanka.   He  had  represented  several
    Tamil youths arrested on suspicion of involvement  with  the  LTTE.  He
    observed that authorities normally obtain confession from the detainees
    by way of torture which the state authorities  rely  on  when  bringing
    actions in the courts.

410. The second appellant gave oral evidence.  He adopted  his  two  witness
    statements and was tendered  for  cross-examination  by  Mr  Hall.   He
    stated that  at  the  army  camp,  neither  his  fingerprints  nor  his
    photograph had been taken.  He had  signed  something  in  the  Sinhala
    language but he did not know what it was.  He had been issued  with  an
    identity card, which had been checked, to ensure he was Sri Lankan.  It
    was taken from him at the camp and he did not receive it back.  He  was
    in Chettikulam when his identity was checked and  when  he  signed  the
    Sinhala language paper.  He went to Anuradhapura from there.

411. It was in Anuradhapura camp that  he  was  ill-treated.   He  had  been
    transferred to Anuradhapura after only two days in Chettikulam.  He was
    not questioned in Chettikulam; detainees were  sorted  there  into  two
    groups, LTTE members and non-members.  The appellant denied that he was
    an LTTE member, but he was transferred to Anuradhapura anyway.   There,
    he was asked the same question, and was tortured.  He believed that his
    ill-treatment in Anuradhapura, where he was tortured,  was  because  he
    had been arrested during the final conflict of the civil war.   He  was
    brought in with  LTTE  members  and  separated  from  the  others.   He
    admitted in Anuradhapura that he was  an  LTTE  member  and  then  they
    started to ill-treat him. He had to admit it, because it was true,  and
    because  of  the  serious  beatings.   The  appellant  had  given   his
    fingerprints and confession in Chettikulam and he believed  that  there
    would be a record of his assisted 'escape'.  There was a Terrorist  Act
    in Sri Lanka; even after release, LTTE members could  not  move  freely
    there.

412. The appellant's parents were not transferred to Anuradhapura  but  were
    detained in Chettikulam and released after about a month.  During their
    detention in Chettikulam,  posters were displayed  with  the  names  of
    those who had been transferred to Anuradhapura.  That had  enabled  his
    father to find out where the appellant was detained; his  father  asked
    his paternal uncle to help organise the  appellant's  release,  through
    PLOTE.  The uncle paid an enormous bribe to  CID  officers,  about  3.5
    lakh rupees, to achieve his release.

413. The appellant asserted that the evidence in  his  mother's  letter  was
    the truth. He had spoken to his  mother  since  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom, but her knowledge of how he had left Sri Lanka came  from  his
    uncle; the appellant had not told her about it.  He had told her  about
    being ill-treated and the other matters.  He had  told  her  about  the
    circumstances of his release.  The appellant could not explain why  all
    the supporting documents he produced referred to his  having  signed  a
    document in Anuradhapura camp, which was no longer his own evidence. He
    had left Sri Lanka on a passport provided by the agent.

414. In re-examination, Ms  Anzani  clarified  the  following  points:   the
    appellant had signed two documents in the Sinhala language,  the  first
    on the second day at Chettikulam.  He stated that the paper was  blank;
    he had signed it although they  had  not  ill-treated  him  there.  The
    second document was signed when he was released  from  Chettikulam  and
    was similar to the previous one.  He confirmed that it was his evidence
    that he had not signed any document at Anuradhapura.   The  account  he
    gave now was the truth.

Submissions

415. Mr Hall's argument in the context of the Secretary of  State's  general
    submissions on the circumstances for returnees to Sri Lanka is that the
    key question is not whether the second appellant's  previous  detention
    would become known to the authorities but whether he would be perceived
    as connected to or potentially connected to  the  re-emergence  of  the
    LTTE.

416. The evidence was that the second appellant was a low-level LTTE  cadre:
     there was every reason to believe  that  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
    would consider that any risk the second appellant presented  (which  is
    doubtful) could  be  contained  by  means  of  monitoring  and  perhaps
    rehabilitation.

417. Submissions made on behalf of  the  second  appellant  make  these  key
    points:

    a) Given the general positive credibility finding made  by  the  First-
       tier Tribunal judge and in the absence of any  adverse  findings  to
       the contrary the following should be deemed to be accepted:

           i) the second appellant was  released  following  payment  of  a
              bribe by his paternal uncle; and
          ii) he left Sri Lanka  clandestinely  travelling  to  the  United
              Kingdom via Dubai, Turkey and Portugal with  the  aid  of  an
              agent.

    b) As to the nature of the document signed, that was not  a  matter  of
       which the present Tribunal  was  seised.   The  credibility  of  the
       appellant's account had been accepted, including that he had  signed
       an  unknown  document  written  in   the   Sinhala   language.   Any
       inconsistency in his evidence as to which  was  the  camp  where  he
       signed it was unsurprising:  inconsistencies of this kind in  asylum
       appeals are not unusual, the Tribunal  should  have  regard  to  the
       notorious unreliability of memory over time, and the context  within
       the events were said to have occurred.

    c) Alternatively, even if there were no  purported  confession  on  the
       second appellant's record, he remained at risk on return.   Even  if
       after his release he was not recorded as having absconded, a  record
       would have been made of his  known  connections  to  the  LTTE,  his
       period of detention at Anuradhapura detention camp and  his  failure
       to complete the rehabilitation process.

    d) Before returning to Sri Lanka, the appellant would require a  travel
       document and would have to complete an application at  the  SLHC  in
       London, since he had  never  possessed  a  passport.   He  would  be
       interviewed there and also on return by DIE, SIS and CID.  It  would
       be extraordinary if he were not asked about his reasons for  leaving
       Sri Lanka and his past history.

    e) The appellant  continued  to  contend  that  the  adduced  documents
       corroborated his mother's account of further  visits  and  were  not
       fabricated, as Mr Hall contended, to complete gaps  in  his  earlier
       account.

418. As an  LTTE  cadre  who  had  not  completed  his  rehabilitation,  the
    appellant risked being perceived as  linked  to  the  LTTE  resurgence,
    because of his known former LTTE links; that risk was enhanced  by  his
    having spent time in the United Kingdom; the on-going interest  in  him
    after his arrival in the United Kingdom;  his  irregular  release  from
    detention; his illegal departure from Sri Lanka; his likely return on a
    TTD, rather than a national  ID  card  or  passport;  and  his  missing
    brother's involvement in the LTTE.

Conclusions on the second appellant's appeal

419. Our starting point is the findings  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that
    have been preserved.  The second appellant was found to be credible  as
    to those aspects of his account that the  judge  accepted.   We  remind
    ourselves that further time has passed since the  events  in  question.
    The  appellant's  oral  account  before  us  contained  a   number   of
    discrepancies with the account he gave, and which was  found  credible,
    in the First-tier  Tribunal.   In  particular,  he  gave  a  discrepant
    account of where he had signed the Sinhala document (now said to be two
    documents).  His account of his admission that he was an LTTE member is
    also confused as to whether he admitted it before or after the beatings
    in  Anuradhapura.   The  additional  evidence  he  provided   was   all
    supportive of his earlier account that he was tortured into  signing  a
    confession in Anuradhapura, which is not now his account.

420. If we had been hearing this appeal for the first time,  we  might  have
    taken a different view from that taken by the First-tier Tribunal as to
    overall credibility, but we bear in mind  that  these  events  occurred
    some time ago now and that the positive credibility findings,  and  the
    findings of fact in the First-tier Tribunal were  expressly  preserved.
    We have, therefore, focused on the evidence and submissions  concerning
    the issue identified, that is, whether  his  previous  detention  would
    cause adverse interest in him if he were returned today.

421. The following are the points relevant to that assessment:

       i) This appellant was rounded up with others including  his  parents
          and taken to Chettikulam camp, where he was rapidly identified as
          an LTTE cadre and moved to Anuradhapura  Camp,  where  conditions
          were worse.   His  parents  were  not  moved  and  were  released
          quickly.  That account is entirely consistent with  events  after
          the civil war ended in May 2009;
      ii) The second appellant was not ill-treated  whilst  at  Chettikulam
          camp; if it was there that he signed the  Sinhalese  document  or
          documents, we consider that  indicates  that  it  (or  they)  was
          probably a benign document (perhaps  a  release  or  transfer  to
          Anuradhapura camp), not a confession;
     iii) The appellant's evidence that he signed such a document  both  on
          his arrival and after his release indicates  to  us  that  it  is
          reasonably likely that this was a form of record keeping  of  his
          entry into and exit from the camp;
      iv) The second appellant did  not  sign  any  confession  or  adverse
          document in Anuradhapura detention camp; and
       v) He was released informally after payment of a huge bribe  to  the
          CID at Anuradhapura and left Sri Lanka on a passport to which  he
          was not entitled.

422. We next consider the evidence relating to the  alleged  enquiries  made
    about  the  second  appellant's  whereabouts,  and  if  credible,  what
    triggered those enquiries.  The undated letter from Mr Varatharsan, the
    Grama Sevaka, refers to the second appellant being listed as an escapee
    and wanted for further questioning.  We do not  consider  that  we  can
    place much weight on that letter, given that the underlying account  is
    not that upon which the appellant now relies.  The same applies to  the
    appellant's mother's account of the visits of the security  forces  and
    their assertion that the appellant is an escapee and a  'hardcore  LTTE
    member':  the authorities did  not  put  him  into  the  rehabilitation
    programme in 2009 and given the amount of intelligence they received at
    the end of the civil war, they would be  well  aware  of  the  type  of
    activities in which he engaged (bunker  digging  and  transporting  the
    wounded).

423. The 5 December 2011 letter from Mr Kumar  refers  to  his  having  made
    'few enquiries' but  not  from  whom:   save  where  its  contents  are
    corroborated by other evidence (in relation to the  second  appellant's
    detention between May - August 2009 and  his  LTTE  involvement),  they
    merely reflect what his mother  told  the  author.  In  particular,  no
    source is given for  Mr  Kumar's  understanding  that  the  Sri  Lankan
    security forces are now 'highly interested' in  the  second  appellant.
    His evidence as to the appellant's release is that the authorities  may
    have listed him as an escapee because he was not  released  officially,
    but that is supposition rather than evidence.

424. It appears from the evidence that  the  second  appellant  was  not  of
    sufficient concern in 2009 to be one of the 11,000 active  LTTE  cadres
    who   were   considered   to   require   re-education    through    the
    "rehabilitation" programme before being reintroduced  into  Sri  Lankan
    civil society.  However, it has been  found  as  a  fact  that  he  was
    questioned and ill-treated in Anuradhapura camp.  He  was  released  on
    payment of a bribe, which accords with the expert  evidence  before  us
    indicating that bribery and corruption are endemic in Sri Lanka.

425. We  accept  that  there  is  likely  to  be  a  record  of  the  second
    appellant's presence in Chettikulam  and  Anuradhapura  camps  but  the
    letter from his Grama Sevaka does not indicate that there  is  a  Court
    order or arrest warrant which  would  result  in  his  appearing  on  a
    computerised "stop" list at the airport and  being  re-detained  there.
    We consider that the Grama Sevaka would be aware of such documents.

426. We have considered what interest the authorities  might  have  in  this
    appellant today.  It is not suggested  that  the  second  appellant  is
    among those  in  the  London  diaspora  who  are  actively  seeking  to
    destabilise the single Sri Lankan  state.   The  appellant  was  not  a
    fighter: his activities for the LTTE did not include  weapon  training;
    he was a bunker digger and transporter  of  the  wounded.  One  of  the
    second appellant's brothers is  among  those  who  disappeared  in  the
    closing days of the civil war and is presumed dead.

427. We bear in mind that the second appellant, having tried to  pose  as  a
    civilian, was quickly identified in 2009 as  having  LTTE  connections,
    suffered significant ill-treatment in Anuradhapura Camp over  a  period
    of 3 months and 10 days at the end of the civil war, and  was  released
    informally.  His paternal cousin, who was in  the  LTTE,  is  still  in
    detention four years after the civil war.  The appellant has spent time
    in London, which is a diaspora hotspot.  The First-tier Tribunal  judge
    accepted that a group of  officers  carrying  walkie-talkies,  some  in
    uniform, visited the family home in Jaffna in September 2010, asked  to
    see the family ration card, and asked where he was.   When  his  mother
    said he was still in the camps, they told her that there was no one  of
    that name in the camps and 'his mother had better find him'.  The judge
    concluded that the authorities did not know he was missing or had  been
    informally released from detention when  they  visited  his  home,  and
    there appear to have been  no  further  consequences  for  the  family,
    although the judge also notes the appellant's account that  the  family
    were under suspicion.

428. We have had regard to paragraph 339K of the Rules:

           "339K. The fact that  a  person  has  already  been  subject  to
           persecution or serious  harm,  or  to  direct  threats  of  such
           persecution  or  such  harm,  will  be  regarded  as  a  serious
           indication of the person's well-founded fear of  persecution  or
           real risk of suffering  serious  harm,  unless  there  are  good
           reasons to consider that such persecution or serious  harm  will
           not be repeated."

    The effect of that provision is that where the  circumstances  are  the
    same, then past persecution or  serious  harm  is  to  be  regarded  as
    predictive of future persecution or serious harm, absent  a  change  of
    circumstances.

429. We have set out our reasons for considering that  the  GOSL's  approach
    has modified since the appellant's last detention.  The burden is  upon
    the appellant to satisfy us, to the lower standard of a real risk, or a
    reasonable degree of likelihood, that if returned he would be  at  risk
    of persecution or serious harm from the Sri  Lankan  authorities.   The
    process of obtaining a TTD will mean that  the  authorities  learn  all
    they need  to  know  about  his  background  before  issuing  a  travel
    document.

430. Given the  sophisticated  intelligence  available  to  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities, within and without Sri Lanka, we consider that  they  will
    know what separatist activities he undertook in Sri Lanka and what  his
    activities have been in the United Kingdom.   We  must  ask  ourselves,
    therefore, whether having regard  to  his  known  low-level  activities
    during the conflict (bunker  digging  and  transporting  the  wounded),
    there is a real risk that the second appellant will be perceived to  be
    a diaspora activist with a  significant  role  in  diaspora  activities
    designed to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan  state  and  revive  the
    internal armed conflict.

431. The appellant's evidence is that the authorities do  know  that  he  is
    not in his home area and no longer in any camp:  his mother's  evidence
    regarding the visit made to her home, when her  family  documents  were
    checked, if credible,  indicate  that  they  are  concerned  about  his
    present whereabouts. It is possible that  his  name  may  appear  on  a
    "watch" list on the airport computers.  That would not stop him passing
    through the airport but it means that  he  will  be  monitored  by  the
    security services in his home area once  he  returns  there.   However,
    that level of  monitoring  does  not  of  itself  engage  international
    protection.

432. We approach his appeal on the basis  that  when  the  second  appellant
    returns to Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan authorities will know (a) that  he
    was in a detention camp and was released informally (b) that he  has  a
    relative who is still in prison, four years after the  civil  war;  but
    that (c) that since the end of the  civil  war  and  his  detention  in
    Anuradhapura camp, the second appellant has not taken any  part,  still
    less a significant part, in Tamil separatist  activity  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

433. We do not consider, on  the  facts  we  have  found,  that  the  second
    appellant has established that there is a real  risk,  or  that  it  is
    reasonably likely, that the Sri Lankan authorities would now regard him
    as a threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state.  We do not
    consider that he would be perceived as having  a  significant  role  in
    relation to post-conflict Tamil separatism within the diaspora and/or a
    renewal of hostilities within Sri Lanka.

434. Accordingly, the second appellant's asylum appeal is dismissed.  He  is
    not entitled to humanitarian protection and his removal will  not  lead
    to a breach of Article  3  ECHR.   No  separate  Article  8  claim  was
    advanced.

The third appellant

435. The agreed questions to be answered in relation to the third  appellant
    were:

   (i)      Based on the factual findings preserved by the Court of  Appeal,
        would the third appellant face persecution and/or serious  harm  on
        return to Sri Lanka?
   (ii)     On Devaseelan principles, what impact do  the  findings  in  the
        third appellant's brother's appeal have on the credibility  of  the
        third appellant's account of interest in him  and  members  of  his
        family since he left Sri Lanka?
   (iii)    What additional findings of fact in relation to events since the
        appellant left Sri Lanka should be made, and what  effect  do  such
        findings have on risk on return for the third appellant?

Facts

436. The third appellant did not give evidence in  these  proceedings.   The
    facts  are  those  in   Immigration   Judge   Walker's   January   2010
    determination which the Court of Appeal[19] ordered to be preserved:

          a) The appellant was involved with the LTTE  from  1995-1997.   He
             was given three  months'  military  training  then  joined  its
             medical unit. He was injured in a shell explosion in 1997 as  a
             result of which he has numerous shrapnel wounds  on  his  lower
             limbs, mostly on the left side.

          b) The appellant was detained and tortured between  November  2001
             and March 2002, and signed a confession before his release.

          c) The appellant has two sets of scars  on  his  body,  one  group
             caused by being burned with hot cigarette butts  and  hot  iron
             rods, and the second group caused by numerous  shrapnel  wounds
             from a shell explosion.

          d) The appellant was released from detention  after  the  February
             2002 ceasefire.  The appellant then lived and  worked  for  the
             Land Survey Company in Colombo for three years. He did not come
             to the adverse attention of the authorities during  the  period
             March 2002-January 2005.

          e) Contrary to his assertion, his Sri Lankan identity card had not
             been taken from him when  he  was  detained.   It  was  in  his
             possession on 2 January 2003, when  he  applied  for,  and  was
             issued, a Sri Lankan passport.  He made the application  openly
             and without difficulty.

          f) The appellant came to the United Kingdom  on  a  student  visa,
             travelling in January 2005, and seeking further leave to remain
             in September 2008.  He was not a good student;  his  attendance
             was low and the September 2008 renewal application failed.  His
             attitude towards his  studies  was  'cavalier'.   He  told  the
             Immigration Judge in January 2010 that he had not been studying
             at all since November 2008.

          g) The appellant stated that he had travelled to India in 2008  to
             marry his Sri Lankan wife.   This  was  inconsistent  with  his
             account that she did not know that he was  wanted  by  the  Sri
             Lankan authorities.  His claim that on return from  India,  his
             wife had been arrested, detained, and had not been  heard  from
             since was untrue and an embellishment.

          h) The appellant's claim that  his  mother  had  reported  to  him
             numerous  visits  from  the  CID  asking  about  him  was  also
             fabricated and untrue.  The  Sri  Lankan  authorities'  records
             would show that he had  left  Sri  Lanka  legally  on  his  own
             passport, which he had applied for openly and received  without
             difficulty. The authorities had no need to ask his mother where
             he was.

          i) The appellant's claim that his brother was in the  LTTE  was  a
             fabrication.  The appellant himself was  not  being  sought  in
             January 2010:  the authorities had no  interest  in  him.   His
             wife had not been arrested and the  authorities  had  not  been
             visiting his home looking for him.

          j) The third appellant had taken a casual approach to his  claimed
             studies in the United Kingdom; his attendance  and  success  in
             those studies were both very low.

          k) There was no allegation of diaspora activities  in  support  of
             LTTE resurgence since the appellant came to the United Kingdom.



Third appellant's brother's determination

437. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lester  allowed  the  asylum  appeal  of  the
    third  appellant's  brother  in  February  2011.   The  appellant  gave
    evidence in his brother's appeal, and both  brothers  were  treated  as
    credible witnesses in her determination.  The judge did not set out  in
    full the findings preserved by the Court of Appeal in  respect  of  the
    third appellant.  It is not clear from her  determination  whether  she
    directed herself to discount the credibility  of  those  parts  of  his
    account which the  Court  of  Appeal  found  to  be  fabricated  and/or
    embellished.

438. On the basis that the appellant  and  his  brother  were  witnesses  of
    truth, the judge found the following facts in the brother's appeal:

   1. The appellant, his brother in the United Kingdom and  another  brother
      all received basic LTTE training and were  associated  with  the  LTTE
      until the ceasefire.

   2. The appellant's brother had been detained and tortured  in  2008.   He
      had cigarette burn scars on his body, as  well  as  scars  from  being
      beaten by a long instrument.  He had attempted suicide and the risk of
      recurrence was high.

   3. The third appellant's wife had been detained by the authorities  after
      her return from the 2008 wedding and had to  relocate  for  safety  to
      live with her parents.

439. We must consider what additional findings of fact are required  in  the
    light of the brother's determination, applying Devaseelan [2002]  UKIAT
    000702*; what weight we should  place  on  findings  in  the  brother's
    appeal; and whether the findings in  the  brother's  appeal  require  a
    revision  of  the  credibility  findings  in  relation  to  the   third
    appellant's  account  of  post-departure  adverse   interest   in   his
    whereabouts and activities.

440. The first point in relation to the brother's appeal  is  that,  on  the
    face of the determination, the First-tier Tribunal judge  dealing  with
    that appeal evaluated the third appellant's credibility based solely on
    the evidence he gave at his brother's hearing;  her  reasoning  on  the
    third appellant's credibility is  not  in  accordance  with  Devaseelan
    principles, since the first judge's reasoning in the third  appellant's
    own appeal should always be the starting point.  We note  however  that
    she concluded that the third appellant's brother  had  made  a  suicide
    attempt and that all three  of  the  brothers  (including  the  missing
    brother) were associated with the LTTE before the end of the civil war.



Medical evidence

441. A medico legal report from Dr Wilhelm Skogstad MRCPsych,  a  Consultant
    Psychiatrist  at  the  Cassel  Hospital  in  Richmond,  and  a  trained
    psychoanalyst, sets out his history and training and also that  he  has
    provided over 60 psychiatric assessments  and  expert  witness  reports
    over the last 10 years.  He has in the past attended court as an expert
    witness, though he did not do so on this occasion.   After  seeing  the
    appellant for three hours in April 2012 and being given access  to  all
    of his medical records in the United Kingdom, Dr Skogstad concluded  in
    his report that the appellant had severe post-traumatic stress disorder
    (ICD 10 1991, F43) and severe  depression  without  psychotic  symptoms
    (ICD 10 1991, F33.2), all typical of a history of severe trauma.

442. The third appellant has injuries on his body which Dr Andres Izquierdo-
    Martin's medico-legal report described in Istanbul  Protocol  terms  as
    'highly consistent' with his account of  being  beaten  with  different
    blunt instruments, burned with cigarettes and an  iron  bar,  his  head
    submerged in water, his hand cut with a knife, and a  bag  with  petrol
    fumes put over his head.  He has scarring on his chest  and  upper  and
    lower limbs.

443. In relation to suicide risk, at paragraph 4.6.4 under  the  heading  of
    Mental State Examination, Dr Skogstad said this:

           "4.6.4      His  mood  was  severely  depressed  throughout  the
           examination, with a deep sense of hopelessness.   His  range  of
           affect was severely reduced, so that there was little indication
           of any other feelings during the examination.  When  plagued  by
           intrusive memories [of the traumas and torture in Sri Lanka]  he
           became at times very distressed.  He showed  a  high  degree  of
           suicidality,  with   suicidal   thoughts,   suicidal   impulses,
           apparently a clear suicidal plan and a serious determination  to
           kill himself in case he was forced to go back to Sri Lanka.

           4.6.5 He has a severely disturbed sleep  pattern,  with  reduced
           sleep, difficulties falling asleep, disrupted  sleep  and  early
           awakening.  He frequently has  nightmares,  which  have  a  very
           concrete quality and whose content is related to torture and the
           threat of being killed.  He sometimes appears to scream  in  his
           sleep or even get up and walk around while still asleep."

444. At paragraph 5.2, Dr Skogstad dealt with the impact of  the  threat  of
    return to Sri Lanka.  His opinion was that, independent of  any  actual
    risk, the appellant was clearly convinced that if returned to Sri Lanka
    he would again be arrested, detained and tortured.  He continued:

           "5.2.1 ...I am therefore of the firm opinion that in  [the  case
           of  deportation]  his  already   severe   mental   state   would
           deteriorate further and his  already  significant  suicide  risk
           would become extremely high. It is highly likely that  he  would
           do everything to prevent being deported by taking his own  life.
           ...

           5.2.3 ...While there is still some small hope of being  able  to
           remain in this country, however, his suicide risk is likely to e
           contained.  This would change dramatically if removal  became  a
           definite threat and reality.  In  this  case  his  suicide  risk
           would rise sharply.  While his suicide  risk  is  therefore  not
           solely dependent on the question of removal, the degree  of  the
           risk is.  ...

           5.2.5 Should  it  turn  out  to  be  possible  to  prevent  [the
           appellant] from committing suicide and a  deportation  could  be
           carried out successfully, the removal to Sri Lanka would  in  my
           opinion cause severe mental suffering to him. ...even  if  there
           were adequate mental health services in Sri Lanka, his suspicion
           of the professionals in his own country would be  too  great  to
           trust them sufficiently to accept any treatment or support.   It
           would therefore also be impossible in my view for  him  to  seek
           out treatment by himself in Sri Lanka."

445. In Dr Skogstad's opinion, the third appellant was  not  coping  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He was in need  of  a  carer  and  better  psychiatric
    support; his condition was likely to improve only when his  immigration
    status was settled, if that occurred. Dr Skogstad considered  that  the
    third appellant was not an untruthful witness and had made  no  attempt
    to mislead him; however he had serious  doubts  about  the  appellant's
    ability  to  give  reliable  evidence  due  to  his  comprehension  and
    responses being hampered by  intrusive  memories  and  flashbacks.   Dr
    Skogstad did not consider him fit to testify.

446. A supplementary report dated 8 January 2013 maintained the findings  as
    to suicide risk, truthfulness, fitness to give evidence, past  history,
    and diagnosis.  A more intensive treatment plan had been put  in  place
    but, as predicted, given the continuing uncertainty, treatment has  had
    very little effect on his mental health.  The third appellant  did  not
    give oral evidence at the hearing before us.

Conclusions on the third appellant's appeal

447. The third appellant is a person with an LTTE history and with what  the
    UNHCR Guidelines refer to as "more elaborate links" to the LTTE (if the
    account about his missing brother is accepted).  He has another brother
    who is a successful asylum seeker on LTTE and suicidality grounds.   He
    bears both combat and torture marks on his body, but he was released in
    2002 and seems to have been of no further interest to  the  authorities
    in Sri Lanka thereafter.

448. Since arriving in the United  Kingdom,  this  appellant  has  taken  no
    part, still  less  a  significant  role,  in  United  Kingdom  diaspora
    activities:  he is not reasonably likely to be perceived  as  a  person
    seeking to destabilise the  single  Sri  Lankan  state  or  revive  the
    internal armed  conflict.   We  remind  ourselves  that  the  GOSL  has
    sophisticated sources of intelligence and would be aware of  this  lack
    of involvement, certainly by the time  a  travel  document  is  issued.
    There is no real risk that this appellant falls within the new  country
    guidance set out in this determination.  His asylum, Article 3 ECHR and
    humanitarian protection claims therefore fail.

449. We must, however,  consider  the  appellant's  mental  health  problems
    under the ECHR. He bears on his body  the  scars  of  significant  ill-
    treatment in Sri Lanka: he has severe  post-traumatic  stress  disorder
    and severe depression, both of  which  Dr  Skogstad  considered  to  be
    typical of trauma victims. His mental  health  is  fragile  and  he  is
    considered a suicide risk even in the United Kingdom;  although  he  is
    being treated, the treatment is having relatively little effect.

450. We reminded ourselves of the six elements of the test set out  in  J  v
    SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629, which may be summarised thus:

           (1)   The ill-treatment relied upon must attain a minimum  level
           of  severity  such  that  it  is  "an  affront  to   fundamental
           humanitarian principles to remove an  individual  to  a  country
           where he  is  at  risk  of  serious  ill-treatment":  see  Ullah
           paragraphs [38-39];
           (2)   The appellant must show a causal link between the  act  or
           threatened act of removal or expulsion and the inhuman treatment
           relied  on  as  violating  the  applicant's  article  3  rights.
           Examination  of  the  article  3  issue  "must  focus   on   the
           foreseeable consequences of the removal of the applicant to  Sri
           Lanka...";
           (3)   In the context of a foreign case, the article 3  threshold
           is particularly high simply because it is a foreign case. And it
           is even higher where the alleged inhuman treatment  is  not  the
           direct or indirect responsibility of the public  authorities  of
           the receiving state, but results from some  naturally  occurring
           illness, whether physical or mental.
           (4)   An article 3 claim can in principle succeed in  a  suicide
           case;
           (5)    Where  the  applicant's  fear  of  ill-treatment  in  the
           receiving state upon which the risk of suicide  is  said  to  be
           based is not objectively well-founded, that will tend  to  weigh
           against there being a real risk that  the  removal  will  be  in
           breach of article 3;
           (6)   The  decision  maker  must  have  regard  to  whether  the
           removing and/or the receiving state has effective mechanisms  to
           reduce the risk of suicide. If there are  effective  mechanisms,
           that too will weigh heavily against an  applicant's  claim  that
           removal will violate his or her article 3 rights.

451. To those principles, we must also add the observation of  Lord  Justice
    Sedley in Y (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 362, at paragraph  [16],
    that

           "...what may nevertheless be of equal importance is whether  any
           genuine fear which the appellant may establish,  albeit  without
           an objective foundation, is such as to create a risk of  suicide
           if there is an enforced return".

452. We note that the appellant  has  a  genuine  fear  of  return  and  has
    difficulty in trusting or interacting with official  figures,  even  in
    the United Kingdom.  He has suicidal ideation and firm plans to  commit
    suicide rather than return, even though  there  have  as  yet  been  no
    executed suicide attempts. One of his brothers is here as a refugee and
    has made executed suicide attempts. Another brother is stated  to  have
    disappeared in Sri Lanka.

453.  Although  the  appeal  fails  under   the   Refugee   Convention   and
    Qualification Directive, we must  consider  whether  the  suicide  risk
    which this appellant presents is such as  to  engage  Article  3  ECHR.
    Applying the J and Y principles, and reminding ourselves of the gravity
    of the appellant's past experience of  ill-treatment  and  his  current
    grave mental health problems, with severe forms of both  post-traumatic
    stress disorder and depression, we have  considered  whether  returning
    the  appellant  to  Sri  Lanka  will  breach   the   United   Kingdom's
    international obligations under Article 3.

454. The evidence is that there are only 25  working  psychiatrists  in  the
    whole of Sri Lanka.  Although there are some mental  health  facilities
    in Sri Lanka, at  paragraph  4  of  the  April  2012  UKBA  Operational
    Guidance Note on Sri Lanka, it records an observation  by  Basic  Needs
    that "money that is spent on mental health  only  really  goes  to  the
    large  mental  health  institutions  in  capital  cities,   which   are
    inaccessible and do not  provide  appropriate  care  for  mentally  ill
    people"[20].

455. In the  UKBA  Country  of  Origin  Report  issued  in  March  2012,  at
    paragraph 23.28-23.29, the following information is recorded from a BHC
    letter written on 31 January 2012:

           " 23.28 The BHC letter of 31 January 2012 observed that:  "There
           are no psychologists working within the public  sector  although
           there are [sic] 1 teaching at the University of  Colombo.  There
           are no numbers available for psychologists  working  within  the
           private sector. There are currently 55 psychiatrists attached to
           the Ministry of Health and working across the country."

                 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

           23.29 The BHC letter of 31 January 2012468 observed that:

           "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was first  recognised  in
           Sri Lanka in patients affected by the 2004 tsunami. Many of  the
           psychiatrists and support  staff  in  Sri  Lanka  have  received
           training in Australia and  the  UK  for  the  treatment  of  the
           disorder. A Consultant Psychiatrist from  NIMH  said  that  many
           patients often sought ayurvedic or traditional treatment for the
           illness long before approaching public  hospitals,  adding  that
           this often resulted in patients then suffering from psychosis.""

456. We note that the third  appellant  is  considered  by  his  experienced
    Consultant Psychiatrist to  have  clear  plans  to  commit  suicide  if
    returned and that he is mentally very ill, too  ill  to  give  reliable
    evidence.  We approach assessment of his  circumstances  on  the  basis
    that it would be possible  for  the  respondent  to  return  the  third
    appellant to Sri Lanka without his coming to harm, but once  there,  he
    would be in the hands of the Sri Lankan mental  health  services.   The
    resources in Sri Lanka are sparse and are limited to  the  cities.   In
    the light of the respondent's own evidence that in her OGN  that  there
    are facilities only in  the  cities  and  that  they  "do  not  provide
    appropriate care for mentally ill people" and of the severity  of  this
    appellant's mental illness, we are  not  satisfied  on  the  particular
    facts of this appeal, that returning him to Sri  Lanka  today  complies
    with the United Kingdom's international  obligations  under  Article  3
    ECHR.

457. The third appellant's appeal  is  therefore  dismissed  on  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection grounds but allowed under Article 3  ECHR.   We
    do not need to go on to consider Article 8  ECHR.   The  respondent  is
    directed to grant appropriate leave to the appellant.

DECISIONS AND DIRECTION

In each case, the making of the previous decisions involved an  error  on  a
point of law and the previous decisions are set aside,  as  set  out  above.
Our decisions on the individual appeals are as follows:

(1)   The appeal of the first appellant is allowed on asylum and  Article  3
ECHR grounds.  It  is  dismissed  on  humanitarian  protection  grounds.  No
separate Article 8 claim was advanced. The respondent is directed  to  grant
appropriate leave to the first appellant.

(2)    The  appeal  of  the  second  appellant  is  dismissed   on   asylum,
humanitarian protection, and human rights grounds.  No  separate  Article  8
claim was advanced.

(3)   The  appeal  of  the  third  appellant  is  dismissed  on  asylum  and
humanitarian protection grounds  but  allowed  under  Article  3  ECHR.  The
respondent is directed to grant appropriate leave to the third appellant.

   1. Existing country guidance

 1A.  Has there  been  any  material  change  which  is  'well  established
       evidentially and durable' in the situation in Sri Lanka since TK was
       decided, and if so what effect does that have on  the  risk  factors
       identified in LP and TK?

 1B.  In the light of the circumstances in Sri Lanka today, should any risk
       factors  be  added,  removed  or  treated  as  having   changed   in
       significance?

 1C.  What is the effect on United Kingdom country  guidance  (present  and
       future) of the decision of the European Court  of  Human  Rights  in
       E.G. v UK, and is the Tribunal bound to follow it?

   2. Circumstances of exit from Sri Lanka

 2A.  What procedures exist (and/or have existed in the  past)  to  prevent
       people who are of interest  to  the  authorities  from  leaving  Sri
       Lanka?

 2B.  What is the relevance to the assessment of credibility or risk  where
       an individual left Sri Lanka via Colombo Airport at a time when they
       claimed to be at risk from the security forces?

   3. Forcible return to Sri Lanka

 3A   What is the procedure used by the Secretary of  State  when  removing

 4.   Colombo Airport - returnees

 4A   What entry procedures do the Sri Lankan authorities have in place  at
       Colombo airport for returning Sri Lankan citizens?

 4B        Do those procedures differ if:

          i) A person is seeking to enter the country on  a  document  other
             than a valid Sri Lankan passport?

         ii) A person is being forcibly removed to Sri Lanka?

        iii) A person is being forcibly removed to Sri Lanka  on  a  charter
             flight, as opposed to a scheduled flight?

 4C.  What information about a returnee is currently available to  the  Sri
       Lankan authorities  at  Colombo  airport?  If  such  information  is
       available, what is its source?

 4D.  In what circumstances are nationals of Sri Lanka detained at  Colombo
       airport on arrival?

 4F.  Is a person required  on  arrival  at  the  airport  to  provide  the
       authorities with an address where it is proposed he will stay?

 5.   Living in Colombo

 5A         If  a  returnee  were  to  pass  through  Colombo  airport  and
      thereafter to reside in Colombo:

        i) Is such a person required to register his  presence  in  Colombo
           with the authorities?

       ii) If so, how this is done and what are the consequences of failing
           to register?

 5B   What procedures do the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  have  in  place  in
       Colombo to monitor the activities of its residents i.e. checkpoints?

 5C   Are there are checkpoints (fixed or mobile) in Colombo,  and  if  so,
       what information about any given individual is  available  to  those
       who operate the checkpoints?

   6. Issues relating to  residence  and/or  specified  activity  in  United
   Kingdom

   Is there a real risk of ill treatment  when  returning  from  the  United
   Kingdom (voluntary or enforced departure) for Sri Lankan citizens who:

    i) Have claimed asylum in the United Kingdom;

   ii) Had actual or perceived connections to the LTTE while in Sri Lanka;

  iii) Have or had actual or perceived links to the LTTE or to  critics  of
       the Sri Lankan government outside Sri Lanka; or

   iv)  Have  participated  in  demonstrations  against  the   Sri   Lankan
       government in the UK or elsewhere?

 7.   War crimes witnesses

   Is there any increase or  decrease  in  the  risk  on  return  where  the
   returnee has, or may be perceived to have, witnessed alleged  war  crimes
   during the final phase of the civil war?

 8.   Rehabilitation

 8A.  What is the rehabilitation process and which Sri Lankan citizens have
       been expected to undergo it?

 8B.  Is the rehabilitation process itself persecutory, either as a  scheme
       or in its operation?

 8C.  What is effect on risk on return where an individual with  actual  or
       perceived  LTTE  connections  has  either  (a)  spent  time  in  the
       rehabilitation camps,  or (b) has not yet undergone "rehabilitation"
       due to absence from Sri Lanka or other reasons?

 8D.  Does the subsequent treatment of 'rehabilitees' after  their  release
       from a rehabilitation centre give rise to a real risk of persecution
       and/or serious harm?

   9. Other factors which may be relevant to assessment of risk

 9A.  Is there an enhanced risk to returnees with an  actual  or  perceived
       connection to the LTTE  (other  than  the  'principal  focus'  group
       identified in TK at paragraph 76), whether past or current.  If  so,
       how serious is that risk?

 9B   What is the extent of corruption among the  security  forces  and  in
       custody centres in Sri Lanka, so far as relevant to the other issues
       identified in these appeals?

 9C   What is the effect on present risk of  a  person's  past  release  or
       escape from detention, particularly where this has been achieved  by
       way of bribery?

 9D.  What operational or information links exist between  the  Sri  Lankan
       security forces and pro-government paramilitaries?

 9E.  Is the risk on return different for individuals  claiming  to  be  at
       risk only from pro-government paramilitaries  rather  than  the  Sri
       Lankan authorities?  If so, how does it differ?

   10.      In relation to the individual appellants:

 10A  The first appellant -  Would  the  appellant  face  a  real  risk  of
       persecution or serious harm in Sri Lanka,  on  the  basis  that  his
       previous detention would become known to the authorities  (Direction
       of UTJ McGeachy dated 140/1/12 at �14)?

 10B  The second appellant -

 (a)  Based on the factual findings preserved by the Court of Appeal, would
       the appellant face persecution and/or serious harm on return?

 (b)  On  Devaseelan  principles,  what  impact  do  the  findings  in  his
       brother's appeal have on the credibility of the  second  appellant's
       account of interest in him and members of his family since  he  left
       Sri Lanka?

 (c)  What additional findings of fact in  relation  to  events  since  the
       appellant left Sri Lanka should be made, and  what  effect  do  such
       findings have on risk on return for this appellant?

 10C. The third appellant -

 (a)  Has this appellant been ill-treated in the past and if so, by whom?

 (b)  In the light of the answer to (a) above, is this  appellant  at  real
       risk of persecution and/or serious harm on return?


                                 APPENDIX C

                                UKBA EVIDENCE



      Malcolm Lewis

       1. Malcolm Lewis is currently the respondent's  Country  Manager  of
          the Returns Team in the Migration Directorate of the Foreign  and
          Commonwealth Office, a post he has held since April 2012.   Prior
          to that he was the Migration Delivery Officer  (MDO)  in  Colombo
          from January 2008 until March 2012, and it  was  in  relation  to
          that role, continued  for  a  time  in  the  United  Kingdom  for
          operational reasons,  that  he  was  able  to  assist  the  Upper
          Tribunal.

       2. Mr Lewis prepared and served two statements, the first  dated  28
          January 2013, and the second, filed on 5 February 2013,  the  day
          before the hearing.  In addition, we had the benefit  of  hearing
          his oral evidence.  Mr Lewis was responsible for sixteen  letters
          in the public domain, which had been attached to various  Country
          of Origin Reports prepared by the  respondent[28].   The  letters
          were sent from the British High Commission in Sri Lanka (the BHC)
          to the respondent and recorded Mr Lewis and his locally recruited
          deputy's observation of the returns process for each such flight.
           He was aware of, but had no input into, the letters sent by  his
          successor in the period April - July 2012.   Letters  after  that
          date had been drafted or approved by him, although  he  was  then
          based in the United Kingdom, with the help of the local Migration
          Support Officer (MSO), a  Sri  Lankan  citizen  employed  by  the
          respondent in Colombo and recruited locally. He had  helped  out,
          and even returned to Sri Lanka for  two  short  periods,  because
          there was no one else to do it:  the MDO role had not been filled
          again after his successor left it.

       3. The information in the statements and letters concerned Mr Lewis'
          experience and knowledge of the treatment of returnees on charter
          flights at Colombo Airport, which he had attended  with  a  local
          MSO. The key points from Mr Lewis' evidence, including  his  oral
          evidence, were as follows:

          a) The British High Commission (BHC) in Colombo had a good working
             relationship with the Sri Lankan authorities at Colombo Airport
             with regard to the return of Sri Lankan nationals who  have  no
             leave to enter or remain  in  the  UK.   Returning  Sri  Lankan
             citizens removed on charter flights  from  the  United  Kingdom
             were met at Colombo Airport  by  Mr  Lewis,  the  MDO  and  the
             locally recruited MSO, who would observe the return and  liaise
             with the Department of Immigration and  Emigration  (DIE),  the
             State  Intelligence  Service   (SIS),   the   Police   Criminal
             Investigation Department (CID), the Duty  Manager  for  Airport
             and Aviation  Services  (Sri  Lanka)  Limited  and  Sri  Lankan
             Airlines (the handling agents for the flight(s)).

          b) The BHC liaised regularly with the DIE, SIS and  CID  who  were
             "wholly aware of  the  allegations  levelled  against  them  by
             certain human rights groups and sections of  the  international
             media".  The DIE, SIS and CID had assured BHC officials that no
             arriving passengers were subject to  ill-treatment  at  Colombo
             Airport.

          c) There had been a change in the procedures at  Colombo  airport,
             in response to international pressures.

          d) There were no specific  liaison  arrangements  for  non-charter
             flight returns, but, in practice the MDO and MSO also regularly
             visit the above agencies at the airport and witness the routine
             processing of returnees from a variety of countries.

          e) Neither Mr Lewis nor his MSO had witnessed any ill-treatment of
             returnees on arrival to  Colombo  Airport.   Despite  receiving
             allegations of  ill-treatment  of  returnees  arriving  at  the
             airport,  they  had  not  been  presented  with  any  "credible
             evidence" substantiating these.

          f) As part of the returns process in relation to charter  flights,
             officials  from  the  BHC  had  improved  arrangements  at  the
             airport, to facilitate returns and enable  returnees  to  clear
             security checks  quickly,  including  liaison  with  the  above
             agencies to ensure they were aware of the time and  arrival  of
             the  charter  flight  so  that  logistics   such   as   seating
             arrangements and baggage  handling  were  in  place.   The  BHC
             funded  through  the  Returns  and  Re-Integration   Fund   the
             availability of additional Tamil speaking Immigration  Officers
             at such times, to assist with any language requirements.  Post-
             arrival assistance was offered to every  charter  returnee  via
             the International  Organisation  for  Migration  (IOM)  whereby
             individuals were given the equivalent  of  �50  for  travel  to
             their home area.

          g) Every returnee was provided with the contact details of the BHC
             in Colombo should they want to make contact with the MDO or MSO
             after they left the airport.

          h) When embarking at Colombo Airport,  all  departing  Sri  Lankan
             nationals were required to complete a departure card.   Foreign
             nationals were not required to do so.  The  Sri  Lankan  Bureau
             for Foreign Employment encourage all Sri  Lankan  nationals  to
             register with them if they are travelling abroad for work,  and
             DIE officers routinely question their  nationals  to  ascertain
             the purpose for leaving  Sri  Lanka.   Passports  of  embarking
             passengers are  also  scanned,  checking  details  against  DIE
             databases.

          i) After each charter flight, Mr Lewis as MDO produced a  detailed
             report in letter format stating  all  the  events  from  flight
             arrival until the last returnee  had  cleared  immigration  and
             security controls and was able to depart for home,  a  practice
             that has been used  since  January  2009.   Such  letters  were
             usually published on the website of  the  UKBA  in  either  the
             Country of Origin Information Report or in bulletin form.

          j) As MDO, Mr Lewis used  to  compile  the  letter  based  on  his
             experience at the airport  each  time.   The  contents  of  the
             letter  included  any  observations  concerning   whether   the
             returnees appeared ill or distressed and a description  of  any
             particular interest shown by the authorities in a  returnee  or
             whether any individual had been detained.  Since his return  to
             the United Kingdom, the letters were compiled by his  successor
             MDO or, when he or she has not been in  post,  by  the  MSO  in
             which case the letters were cleared with Mr Lewis in the United
             Kingdom before being forwarded to UKBA.

          k) In addition, Mr Lewis has also compiled letters whilst covering
             the MDO role in Colombo.  On 2 November  2012,  he  prepared  a
             letter which was appended to the bulletin of December 2012,  in
             response to several allegations made in the public domain  that
             the situation for Tamils had deteriorated and there was a  high
             risk of mistreatment on return.  However, the interviewees were
             selected on the basis of being involved in the returns  process
             in  Sri  Lanka.   This  included  Sri  Lankan   civil   society
             organisations and  human  rights  defenders.   The  individuals
             asked not to be identified.

          l) Mr Lewis attended meetings with the interlocutors between 3 and
             17 September 2012 to gather their responses  to  the  questions
             set out in the letter.  Although they were not asked  to  check
             the  information  in  the  letter  before  it  was   published,
             throughout the interviews their responses  were  read  back  to
             them in order to ensure  what  had  been  said  was  accurately
             recorded. The letter stated that "... the  BHC  have  not  been
             presented with any  credible  evidence  to  substantiate  these
             allegations of ill-treatment of returnees".

          m) IOM had in the past year dealt  with  a  large  number  of  Sri
             Lankans returning from West Africa.   The  processes  for  such
             returns were set out in Mr Lewis's  letter  dated  6  September
             2012.

       4. In his second statement, was served the day before  the  hearing,
          Mr Lewis clarified his understanding of the  questions  asked  by
          the DIE at the airport.   In  addition  to  biographical  details
          (including family  members)  returnees  may  also  be  asked  for
          details of any address  with  which  they  had  been  associated,
          including their last address in  Sri  Lanka  before  leaving  the
          country, their last address in the UK and the  address  to  which
          they intended to proceed after leaving the airport.   They  might
          be asked for historical details such  as  the  names  of  schools
          attended, the dates and the profession and names  of  any  former
          employers, as  well  as  the  details  of  their  travel  history
          including when they left Sri Lanka and (including  the  transport
          used) about any countries they may have lived in before  entering
          the United Kingdom.  They might also be asked for their  date  of
          entry to the UK and their reasons for returning to Sri  Lanka  as
          well as for details of a person  the  authorities  could  contact
          including their telephone number.  Returnees might then be  asked
          to sign a declaration confirming the details provided  are  true.
          Returnees from India were asked similar questions.

       5. Mr Lewis gave his evidence on the first day of  the  hearing  via
          video link through a connexion with the British  High  Commission
          in New Delhi.  He adopted his two statements which  he  confirmed
          to be true.

       6.  In  cross-examination,  Mr  Lewis  gave  the  following  further
          information and clarifications of the evidence in his statements.
           He was referred to a number of letters written by the BHC to the
          respondent during 2012.   Most  of  them  had  been  written,  or
          overseen, by Mr Lewis in his role as  MDO.   There  was  a  short
          period, from April - July 2012, when a new MDO was in  post.   He
          had not contributed  to  those  letters  but  he  had  seen  them
          subsequently.  Mr Lewis confirmed that he had probably  seen  all
          the BHC letters which he had not personally written.

       7. Mr Lewis explained that after his return to the  United  Kingdom,
          he had remained  more  closely  involved  than  anticipated  with
          returns to Sri Lanka, since his successor as MDO for the BHC  had
          only remained in post for three months (from April -  July  2012)
          and had not yet  been  replaced.   BHC  letters  written  to  the
          respondent generated during that three-month period had  not  all
          been seen by him; although he had seen some of  them  he  had  no
          input into what they said about returnees.

       8. After his successor returned to the United Kingdom, Mr Lewis  had
          twice returned to Colombo to cover the MDO role on  a  short-term
          basis,  between 28 August - 18 September 2012, and for two  weeks
          at the beginning of November 2012.

       9. The letters reflected only what the MDO and MSO saw  in  relation
          to charter flights:  neither  of  them  was  required  to  attend
          returns on scheduled flights.  Mr Lewis had no knowledge  of  how
          many returnees travelled on scheduled flights,  or  whether  they
          constituted the majority of returnees.  Whether those returned on
          scheduled flights were questioned by  the  DIE  depended  on  the
          documents on which they travelled, and whether they were escorted
          or not.

      10.  In  some  cases,  the  airline  would  notify  the  Sri   Lankan
          authorities that a passenger was being returned.  In such  cases,
          the airline was required to present the passenger to DIE  but  he
          was unsure whether in practice this always occurred.

      11. Where a passenger travelled on an ETD, Mr Lewis had been told  by
          a DIE spokesman that, under the new Readmission  Case  Management
          System (RCMS), such returnees would  be  identified  and  records
          established on their database before their arrival.  The same was
          not true of those who still had  travel  documents  and  did  not
          require an ETD. If travelling on their  own  passport,  returnees
          could  usually  just  walk  through  and  continue  their  onward
          journey.

      12. Where an ETD was applied for in London, the information  obtained
          by the Sri Lankan High Commission (the SLHC) in London  would  be
          fed back to the Ministry of  External  Affairs  in  Colombo,  who
          would ensure that it was disseminated to the relevant authorities
          within Sri Lanka.  Under the old system the High Commission would
          await confirmation from Colombo that the person was  accepted  to
          be a Sri Lankan citizen, but now there was more flexibility.  The
          SLHC would interview the person in London and, if satisfied  that
          the appellant was indeed  Sri  Lankan,  even  if  there  were  no
          supporting documents, then the SLHC would ask the DIE in  Colombo
          to issue a travel  document,  which  would  be  emailed  through,
          stamped in London and the person's photograph added here.   There
          would still  be  a  further  interview  on  arrival,  partly  for
          bureaucratic  reasons  and  partly  because  the  DIE  would  not
          necessarily trust the judgment of the SLHC in London.

      13. Mr Lewis confirmed the evidence in his letter of 5  January  2012
          to the respondent, as to the arrangements at  the  airport.   The
          SIS had an office within the airport, and patrolled the  airport.
          CID also had a 24 hour desk, but  did  not  patrol  the  airport:
          they dealt with passengers referred to them by the DIE.  The main
          focus was on DIE concerns about those returning from India.   The
          principle, according to a DIE  spokesman  (see  2  November  2012
          letter) was that all charter flight returnees  were  referred  to
          SIS and CID, regardless of whether they had a valid passport, but
          Mr Lewis was aware of instances where that had not occurred.

      14. When interviewed at the  airport,  passengers  were  required  to
          supply the address where they intended to live in Sri Lanka.   Mr
          Lewis was aware of quite a few cases where the police or army had
          gone to confirm the address and referred  to  an  earlier  system
          where the CID used to hold a returnee at the airport pending such
          confirmation  but  pressure  from  the  international   community
          changed procedures.  The addresses are now checked  within  seven
          days following arrival.   This  could  be  by  the  investigation
          department or the uniformed police.

      15. The British authorities do not inform the Sri  Lankan  government
          about the background of returnees,  including  those  who  commit
          offences while in the  United  Kingdom.   Returnees  disembarking
          from charter flights are referred by the DIE to SIS and  CID  who
          sometimes question  the  returnee  jointly,  including  questions
          about the mode of return, the route taken and what they had  been
          doing abroad.  They were also asked about any  criminal  activity
          in Sri Lanka before coming to the United Kingdom.  Mr  Lewis  had
          not personally heard  questions  about  whether  a  returnee  was
          involved with the LTTE, but confirmed, as set out in  his  letter
          of 2 November 2012, that an international  agency  had  told  him
          that the questions included whether the returnee had any links to
          the LTTE and what they had done abroad.  The same letter, and the
          same agency, dealt with returnees retained in  the  transit  area
          and interviewed for about two and a half hours by DIE  officials,
          then another two hours by  the  SIS.   The  number  of  returnees
          interviewed in more detail on that occasion was  between  20  and
          45.

      16. There were  different  locations  for  CID  and  SIS  within  the
          terminal building.  As set out in his letter of 12 December 2012,
          BHC officials were not normally permitted to  be  present  during
          the interviews themselves, but there was normally an  opportunity
          to chat to the returnees as  they  collected  their  baggage  and
          watch them pass through customs.  They were given contact details
          for BHC which they could use later.  Many returnees asked how  to
          obtain a visa to return to the United Kingdom; others  asked  for
          help  returning  to  their  home  villages.   Dealing  with  exit
          procedures, Mr Lewis confirmed that where a person was on a watch
          list, swiping their Sri Lankan passport would bring up an  alert.
          A person would only be on such a list, as set out in  his  letter
          of 5 January 2012, when an arrest warrant was issued, or a  court
          order made to impound a suspect's passport.  In those cases,  the
          person's details would be on an 'alert' or 'wanted' list. Bribery
          and corruption were widespread and a major problem in Sri  Lanka.
          Once a returnee had left the airport, as set out in his letter of
          2 November 2012, the BHC did not monitor their further treatment.
           The unnamed international agency, however,  did  meet  regularly
          with returnees.  He was aware of BHC community projects involving
          returnees.

      17. The next part of Mr Lewis' evidence was given in camera.  He  was
          asked what an MDO would do, if a returnee  alleged  ill-treatment
          during their interview at  the  airport,  or  subsequently.   His
          evidence was that it depended how  such  an  allegation  came  to
          light:  sometimes there was direct contact with the BHC,  but  on
          other occasions, the accusation would be made by email or even in
          a press report.  The BHC would first check whether a person  with
          the name of the alleged complainant had been returned on a flight
          from the United  Kingdom.   They  often  also  checked  with  the
          airport  authorities  to  see  whether  any  returnee  had   been
          questioned.  For example, some years previously, a newspaper  had
          made an allegation regarding someone who  had  been  detained  on
          return from the United  Kingdom.   Mr  Lewis  had  been  able  to
          contact ION who phoned the person in Jaffna.  It turned out  that
          that person had not contacted  the  press  and  had  no  wish  to
          complain.

      18. In relation to another complainant, Mr Lewis explained that there
          had been advance contact by a human rights group,  several  weeks
          before  the  complainant  returned,  saying  that  he  would   be
          mistreated on arrival.  On  return,  there  was  a  complaint  of
          mistreatment, made while the claimant was still detained  at  the
          airport, saying  he  had  been  beaten  and  that  his  head  was
          bleeding.  Mr Lewis had managed to  identify  the  claimant,  who
          indeed was still being processed at the airport, and sent the MSO
          to see him; the claimant said he had been tortured  but  did  not
          mention any particular injury.  He travelled on, with his family,
          and two days later,  as  doctors  in  Jaffna  were  unwilling  to
          document his injury,  the  claimant  was  invited  to  travel  to
          Colombo for a medical examination  two  days  later.  The  report
          confirmed that abrasions to the claimant's shins were  consistent
          with his account of having been kicked at the airport.

      19. Returnees being questioned were not locked in a room but  instead
          sat in an office; however, they would not  be  allowed  to  leave
          until their interviews were complete.  The witness accepted  that
          there was evidence of torture in Sri Lanka,  but  Mr  Lewis  said
          that the Sri Lankan airport authorities  were  not  stupid;  they
          knew that the BHC's, and indeed the  world's  eyes  were  on  the
          returns process.  The authorities would not be so  "daft"  as  to
          harm returnees at the airport.

      20. In cross-examination, Mr Lewis confirmed that an MSO was sent  to
          meet every charter flight.  There had been three charter  flights
          in 2011 and four in 2012.  In the  course  of  these  answers  it
          emerged that the next charter flight had been scheduled  to  take
          place on 28 February 2013:  a number of  Ms  Jegarajah's  clients
          had received letters telling them that they would be  removed  on
          that  date.   Mr  Hall  sought  to  argue  that  the   date   was
          confidential and  ought  not  to  be  disclosed,  but  then  took
          instructions and confirmed the date of 28 February  2013  as  the
          next charter flight.

      21. A more streamlined returns system had  been  implemented  towards
          the end of 2012.  Sri Lanka was seeking to improve its processing
          of readmissions from the European Union.  It operated between the
          Sri Lankan High Commission (in London) and the  DIE  in  Colombo:
          he was not sure whether the SIS had access to the system.  He was
          not sure if SIS linked into it.  Under the Readmission  Agreement
          between the UK and Sri Lankan  governments  required  the  United
          Kingdom to notify the Ministry of External Affairs in Colombo and
          obtain a flight clearance for charter flights.

      22. Mr Lewis was questioned about the respondent's statement that she
          had not been presented with any credible claims of  torture.   He
          was aware of the TAG report  dated  16  December  2012.   In  the
          absence of a permanent MDO in post, the charter flight  reporting
          letters in June, November and September 2012 were produced by the
          MSO in Colombo and his role was to  rephrase  them  from  London.
          The MSO recorded all details of what occurred in a  notebook  and
          she would draft a letter, which would be forwarded to  Mr  Lewis.
          They would discuss it and 'tidy it up', after which it  would  be
          passed to a  BHC  officer  to  send  out.   Her  draft  would  be
          forwarded to him; they would then  discuss  it,  to  ensure  that
          nothing had been left out.  Otherwise, the 'tidying up'  was  not
          for the purpose of making changes of substance.

      23. Thereafter, the draft letter would be passed to a BHC officer  to
          send out.  He thought the draft was also shown to the Deputy High
          Commissioner and the Entry Clearance Officer, and in one case, an
          officer  who  had  accompanied  the  MSO  when  she  attended   a
          particular flight.  Either an Immigration  Liaison  Officer  from
          London would take the  role  of  the  absent  MDO,  or  an  Entry
          Clearance Officer.

      24. For the letter written on 2 November 2012, Mr Lewis  himself  had
          spoken to the  various  agencies  and  written  the  letter.  The
          agencies did not want their names or identities disclosed, so  he
          could not state whether he had spoken to anyone from  UNHCR,  but
          was able to confirm that IOM was one of  the  agencies.   He  had
          spoken to the Sri Lankan CID but not the DIE.

      25. In response to questions from Mr  Spurling,  Mr  Lewis  explained
          that he did not  inform  the  parties  concerned  when  routinely
          monitoring the airport.  He just walked into their offices.  Some
          knew him and some did not.  The names of  the  returnees  on  the
          charter flight were given two weeks before an actual  flight  but
          the list can change "drastically" in that some drop off and  some
          are added.   A  lot  will  have  gone  to  the  Sri  Lankan  High
          Commission in London for an ETD, although Mr Lewis  confirmed  he
          did not know the process from the  London  end.   Attention  then
          turned to the bilateral agreement between the Sri Lankan and  the
          UK government.  Mr Hall was unsure  if  it  was  an  open  source
          document.  This aspect was referred to further on in the hearing.



      26. Mr Lewis also gave further  evidence  regarding  the  layout  and
          arrangements made in the airport for  returnees.   There  was  an
          open area cordoned off near the transfer desk.  He confirmed that
          everyone returning on a charter flight was seen by  CID  and  SIS
          but he  was  unable  to  speak  with  the  same  certainty  about
          returnees on a scheduled flight.  The interviews by SIS  and  CID
          took place in their offices.  The interviews by DIE took place in
          an open area where there was a BHC presence.  IMO took on a  role
          after people were waiting for their baggage.  He also  gave  some
          of his own employment history having started with the Immigration
          Service  in  1979  and  had   received   specific   training   in
          interviewing in his role as an  Immigration  Officer.   This  had
          been in  Folkestone.   He  had  also  received  training  by  the
          Metropolitan Police and by UK Immigration Service.

      27. As to the interlocutors referred to in the letter of  2  November
          2012, the eight referred to are the same throughout  the  report.
          Whether  their  identities   be   disclosed   was   up   to   the
          interlocutors.  He confirmed the nature of the interview in which
          there was dialogue.  He confirmed that the MSO speaks Tamil.  The
          role of the CID was to establish if the returnee had  a  criminal
          record  in  Sri  Lanka  or  the  United  Kingdom  or  (elsewhere)
          overseas.  The SIS wished to know how the returnee had got to the
          UK, what he or she had been doing and how they came back.

      28. In re-examination  Mr  Hall  asked  questions  relating  to  exit
          arrangements.  Mr Lewis explained that these were conducted in an
          open plan area where there were some fifteen to twenty  desks  at
          which people queued.  There were computer terminals on each  desk
          which were connected to scanners.  Mr Lewis  was  unable  to  say
          that he had witnessed individual Sri Lankan Immigration  Officers
          having turned off the scanners when bribed to enable a  party  to
          leave without the passport being read.  All terminals were  faced
          from behind by  the  Chief  Immigration  Officer  who  would  see
          someone switch off.  He had never seen but had heard stories that
          Immigration Officers do not swipe the passport.  He described the
          system as modern  technology  with  an  old  system  having  been
          upgraded with new screens.

      Mike Gallagher

      29. Mr Gallagher is head of the Operational Policy and Rules Unit  of
          the UK Border Agency.  He has worked in the unit  since  11  June
          2012, becoming head of the country of origin information  service
          (COIS) on 9 October 2012.  He  supervises  the  process  for  the
          production of a number of COI reports and bulletins produced each
          year on individual countries.  He also represents the COIS at its
          meetings  with  the  independent  advisory   group   on   country
          information, which acts as an external assessor for  the  quality
          of the reports produced.

      30. In his statement dated 25 January 2013,  Mr  Gallagher  explained
          that his role was strictly supervisory.  He  personally  did  not
          undertake research  or  produce  Country  of  Origin  Information
          Report  on  individual  countries  but  supervises  the  process.
          Additionally he represents  the  Country  of  Origin  Information
          Service (COIS) at its  meetings  with  the  Independent  Advisory
          Group on Country Information (IAGCI) which acts  as  an  external
          assessor.

      31. Reference is made  in  Mr  Gallagher's  statement  to  the  UNHCR
          handbook, with specific reference to a knowledge of conditions in
          the applicant's country of origin and the provisions of paragraph
          339JA of the Immigration Rules, Mr Gallagher explains the purpose
          of the Country of Origin Report bulletins and COI documents which
          is to provide factual information on the objective elements  that
          go into assessing claims for asylum or refugee status.   The  aim
          is for the  information  provided  to  be  up-to-date,  relevant,
          accurate and balanced.  Amongst sources used is the  Foreign  and
          Commonwealth Office (FCO).  In this case the  standard  procedure
          is to ask FCO officials to investigate a  particular  subject  by
          contacting a range  of  local  sources  and  then  document  such
          findings in a disclosable and sourced letter.  In order to obtain
          balanced and accurate information FCO officials  are  advised  to
          seek a range of views from sources  they  consider  reliable  and
          informed on the subject of interest.

      32. The range  of  country  information  products  provided  by  COIS
          includes Country of Origin Information Report which are  produced
          the twenty countries that generate the most  asylum  applications
          in the United Kingdom and are  updated  regularly.   In  addition
          there are Country  of  Origin  Information  bulletins  which  are
          issued when it is  necessary  to  provide  information  at  short
          notice  in  response  to  emerging  events.   Country  of  Origin
          Information Fact-Finding Mission reports are  produced  following
          such missions  to  countries  of  origin.   In  addition,  Agency
          officials have access to an  information  service  request  which
          provides rapid responses  to  specific  country-based  enquiries.
          The reports appear on the UK Border Agency  website.   The  IAGCI
          was established in March 2009 by the Independent Chief  Inspector
          of Borders and Immigration which  makes  recommendations  to  the
          Chief Inspector about the content of material produced  by  COIS.
          The  Group  reviews  and  considers  each   Country   of   Origin
          Information Report approximately every two to three years and the
          Sri Lankan report dated March 2012 was reviewed in May 2012.

      33. In cross-examination, Mr Gallagher confirmed that a number of the
          criticisms by Dr Rampton of the  IAGCI  were  accepted  as  being
          valid by UKBA (as it then was).  Ms Pickup  took  him  through  a
          number of comments which had  not  resulted  in  the  Country  of
          Origin  Report  being  updated  or  amended:   when  pressed,  Mr
          Gallagher's  response  was  in  essence  to  refer  to   updating
          bulletins.  He did not accept that the  criticisms  made  of  the
          report meant that it was  flawed.   He  expected  that  the  next
          country report  on  Sri  Lanka  would  incorporate  Dr  Rampton's
          comments, subject to any relevant modification arising out of the
          situation at the time.

      34. Asked by Ms Pickup to explain why the  accepted  "flaws"  in  the
          March 2012 COIS on Sri Lanka had not been incorporated in the  20
          December 2012 Bulletin, which appeared just one  day  before  the
          UNHCR report, Mr Gallagher had no explanation.  Mr Gallagher  was
          unaware that the UNHCR report on  eligibility  guidance  for  Sri
          Lanka was to be published on that day.   His  evidence  was  that
          COIS editorial comment was restricted to the introduction in  the
          report.  He referred to Dr Rampton's analysis, with reference  to
          specific examples.  The nature of the report was to produce  what
          is  known  about  systemic  human  rights  abuses   rather   than
          individual  cases.   Mr  Gallagher  explained  how  sources  were
          evaluated, characterising the British High Commission (the source
          of  letters  included  in   the   report)   as   an   accountable
          organisation.

      Jonathan Wright

      35.  Mr  Wright  was  an  assistant  director  in  the   respondent's
          Operational Policy and Rules  Unit,  part  of  the  strategy  and
          assurance group, based in Croydon.  Since April 2012 he has  been
          a member of the Country Specific Litigation Team (CSLT), a  small
          team  of  country  specialists,  established   to   provide   the
          respondent's decision makers with guidance on how  to  deal  with
          the common categories of international protection claims for each
          relevant country.  Mr Wright's responsibilities  include  appeals
          guidance and litigation.

      36. CSLT is a small team of country specialists whose prime  role  is
          to provide those involved in the decision making process  in  the
          UK Border Agency  with  guidance  on  how  to  deal  with  common
          categories  of  claim  for  international  protection.   Country-
          specific guidance  to  the  agency's  case  owners  is  primarily
          provided by the production of Operational  Guidance  Notes  (OGN)
          for the top asylum source  countries  and  others  for  which  an
          operational need has been identified.

      37. The OGNs were first produced in 2000.  They do not replace  other
          publicly-available information or guidance, rather the  intention
          is to supplement them.  It  is  emphasised  in  the  introduction
          section of each OGN that the agency's case owners must  not  base
          their decisions purely on the information contained  within,  and
          that it is essential  that  the  guidance  provided  is  read  in
          conjunction with all other relevant information. OGNs are cleared
          for publication by the Director of  the  Operational  Policy  and
          Rules Unit who is responsible for all guidance across the agency.
           In addition  country  information  contained  in  OGNs  is  also
          subject to scrutiny  by  the  Office  of  the  Independent  Chief
          Inspector of Borders and  Immigration.   CSLT  ensures  that  all
          relevant country information and case law is properly  reflected:
          to ensure the  highest  standard  there  is  a  rigorous  quality
          process  involving  consultation  with  internal   and   external
          stakeholders and Home Office legal  colleagues.   CSLT  has  been
          working particularly closely with Still Human Still Here  (SHSH),
          described as a significant external stakeholder.

      38. The Sri Lanka OGN was first published  in  2002  and  the  latest
          version is dated April 2012, following the publication of the COI
          report  for  Sri  Lanka  of  7  March  2012  which   incorporated
          information from the Sri  Lanka  bulletin  of  30  November  2011
          entitled "recent reports of  torture  and  ill-treatment".   That
          bulletin had been produced by  the  agency's  COIS  and  included
          submissions from Freedom  from  Torture  (FFT)  made  to  the  UN
          Committee against Torture (UNCAT).

      39. Mr Wright explained that prior to drafting  the  current  version
          Sri Lanka OGN (version 13) CSLT consulted with case owners within
          the UK Border Agency   "...  as  to  whether  the  existing  main
          categories for asylum  applications  from  Sri  Lankan  nationals
          remain current".  Mr Wright reports  "no  new  trends  in  asylum
          applications were highlighted such as from  individuals  who  had
          previously had valid leave to be in the UK".

      40. The rest of Mr Wright's statement dealt specifically with aspects
          of the current OGN and in particular, comments therein concerning
          the February 2012 publication of an Article by Human Rights Watch
          dealing with eight anonymous cases of mistreatment on  return  to
          Sri Lanka.  After publication of the current  OGN,  in  September
          2012 HRW published evidence of thirteen anonymous allegations  of
          mistreatment on return.  So far as Mr Wright was able to tell, it
          seemed that the thirteen included the original  eight  cases  and
          his statement referred to specific passages in the OGN  regarding
          this.

      41. Country Policy Bulletins were also issued, on an  ad  hoc  basis,
          aiming to provide clear guidance on how to deal  with  particular
          country-specific  issues  arising  in  asylum  and  human  rights
          applications.  It was apparent that urgent consideration  of  the
          reports by HRW, FFT and TAG published in September 2012  alleging
          mistreatment of returnees to Sri  Lanka  was  required.   It  was
          decided within CSLT that  this  could  be  best  addressed  in  a
          Country Policy Bulletin.  CSLT had unsuccessfully requested  from
          HRW and FFT identifying details of the individuals making up  the
          allegations of mistreatment on  return  (Home  Office  reference,
          name and date of birth).  To enable the  Agency  to  substantiate
          the events alleged  and  the  context  of  the  decisions  taken.
          During  the  present  proceedings,   TAG   provided   21   appeal
          determinations which for the first time  gave  those  details  in
          relation to 21 of the 26 cases referred to in their report.

      42. Of the thirteen HRW cases in the September 2012 publication, only
          two alleged mistreatment on return from the United Kingdom to Sri
          Lanka.  In one case, that mistreatment occurred six months  after
          return.  A third case related to removal from the United  Kingdom
          in 2005, which had not caused difficulty; the  allegations  there
          related to a second return to Sri Lanka  from  Germany  after  an
          unsuccessful asylum claim there.  The Country Returns  Operations
          and Strategy team (CROS) were asked if they could  trace  any  of
          those three cases.  As records began only in  2012,  two  of  the
          cases could not be  traced:   the  third  claimed  to  have  been
          removed on a flight on 16 June  2011  but  his  details  did  not
          accord with those of the only  relevant  male  passenger  on  the
          flight manifest.  There was no  record  of  that  male  passenger
          returning to the United Kingdom.  Nor was there any  trace  of  a
          passenger using the name relied  upon  returning  to  the  United
          Kingdom.

      43. UKBA also wished to examine the cases underlying  allegations  by
          FFT and TAG of  a  trend  for  student  visa  holders  and  their
          dependents being detained and mistreated on return.  The  numbers
          put forward by both organisations were very small  when  compared
          to the number of visas issued to Sri Lankan  nationals:  in  2012
          there were 42,633  applications  for  entry  clearance  from  Sri
          Lankan nationals.  32,974 visas were issued.  In 2011 there  were
          35,761 entry clearance applications and 26,158 visas were issued.

      44. The Country Policy Bulletin was cleared at Director level  before
          publication  and  was  first  published  on  15   October   2012.
          Following representations from TAG some changes were made  within
          the report but these did not impact on the overall conclusions; a
          second version of the Bulletin was published  a  week  later.   A
          further challenge was received on 26 November 2012 from  Clifford
          Chance on behalf of Freedom from Torture but was  not  considered
          likely to result in a change in the Bulletin on this occasion.

      Mrs Anita Athi-Parkin

      45. In a statement dated 13 February 2013, Mrs Athi-Parkin, a Country
          Guidance Officer with the respondent, set out the results of  the
          respondent's enquiries in response to the  Tribunal's  disclosure
          order.  In September 2012, the following question was sent to the
          Senior Case Working Network for each  Asylum  Region,  which  had
          just under six months in which to provide the information in  Mrs
          Athi-Parkin's statement:

              "The question we need to ask you is whether caseworkers  have
              noticed any upward trends in asylum claims on  the  basis  of
              detention/torture following return to Sri Lanka,  even  where
              the individual had  not  previously  sought  asylum  but  had
              simply been visiting or studying here?"

      46. Later, in the  context  of  the  country  guidance  appeals,  the
          responding  officials   were   referred   specifically   to   the
          applications for disclosure made by  these  appellants  and  TAG.
          Responses were collected and collated until  February  2013  when
          she made her statement. The following general points emerge  from
          Mrs Athi-Parkin's  statement:

          i) the respondent's published website data on asylum  applications
             undergoes a rigorous validation process before publication;
         ii) resource and financial constraints rendered  it  impossible  to
             say what the basis of each individual asylum  claim  might  be,
             without trawling through all the  claims  on  a  case  by  case
             basis.  The same was true of the basis of asylum grants;
        iii) once an individual was granted a visa to  come  to  the  United
             Kingdom, the UKBA  did  not  collate  data  on  their  movement
             thereafter.  There was no requirement to do so and it would  be
             'extremely resource intensive';
         iv) an existing visa holder who was ill-treated on return to  their
             home country, then came back to the United Kingdom and  claimed
             asylum, would not be  statistically  recorded  as  a  returnee.
             They would simply be listed as new asylum claimants, and it was
             impossible  to  extract  that  data  without  analysing   every
             individual case;
          v) the respondent  was  able  to  make  available  only  anecdotal
             recollections by case owners as to the trend  of  student  visa
             holders making a first claim for asylum (the "recent returnees"
             profile). The data  could  not  be  robust  since  it  was  not
             recorded;
         vi) Between 2009 and September  2012,  5527  Sri  Lankan  nationals
             claimed asylum.  There were 1115 claims in 2009; 1357 in  2010;
             1756 in 2011 and  1299  in  the  nine  months  from  January  -
             September 2012.  The final quarter's figure was not  yet  known
             in February 2013 when she made her statement; and that
        vii) Enquiries as to whether the Sri Lankan authorities maintained a
             list of failed asylum seekers had been made.  The  response  is
             not provided.  "The respondent remains unaware whether the  Sri
             Lankan authorities do or do not maintain such a list".

      47. Dealing with responses from the ten asylum units, she stated that
          that those responses were not 'the  outcome  of  a  rigorous  and
          systematic consideration of all 5527  asylum  applications  since
          2009'.  They were simply the reactions  of  various  case-owners,
          sometimes individuals and sometimes senior case workers.  Not all
          the regional asylum teams responded.   Detained  Fast  Track  and
          Third Country Unit teams had not been asked at all.

      48. The six  asylum  casework  regions  that  responded,  did  so  as
          follows:

      49. Based on this limited, anecdotal survey of asylum caseworkers  in
          her regional offices, Ms Athi-Parkin said this:

              ""21. ...The respondent refers to the  responses  above.   In
              the light of the limitations  on  the  data,  the  respondent
              accepts that there  is  a  pattern  of  persons  with  lawful
              residence in the United Kingdom who claim to have returned to
              Sri Lanka, and to have been detained and tortured there,  and
              who have then returned  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  sought
              asylum.   The  respondent  accepts   that   some   of   these
              individuals have been granted  asylum  by  the  Secretary  of
              State or on appeal to the Tribunal."

      50.  Mr  Hall  when  introducing  this  statement  described  it   as
          demonstrating 'a small trend'.

                              DR DAVID RAMPTON

 1. Dr Rampton is a Fellow in Global  Politics  at  the  London  School  of
    Economics,  with  10  years'  experience  as  a  teacher,   researcher,
    consultant and expert in the  history,  society  and  politics  of  Sri
    Lanka, which was the subject of  his  doctorate  from  SOAS,  where  he
    studied both as an undergraduate and postgraduate.  From 2002-2012,  he
    worked at SOAS as a Senior Teaching Fellow in both  the  Department  of
    Development Studies  and  the  Centre  for  International  Studies  and
    Diplomacy.

 2. He was commissioned  by  the  Independent  Advisory  Group  on  Country
    Information  (IAGCI),  a  body  established  in  March  2009   by   the
    Independent  Chief  Inspector  of  Borders  and  Immigration  to   make
    recommendations regarding the content and quality of material  produced
    by the Home Office's  Country  of  Origin  Information  Service.   Such
    reports are commissioned from persons outside the IAGCI and are used by
    the Group to inform its report to the Independent Chief Inspector.

 3. In that r�le, he has commented on the 2010 and 2012 Sri  Lanka  Country
    of Origin report, as well as UNHCR's 2011  Eligibility  Guidelines  for
    Sri Lanka.  Dr  Rampton's  criticisms  of  the  report,  and  the  UKBA
    response, were summarised in his conclusions as follows:

           "CONCLUSION

           This review has sought to evaluate the  current  2012  UKBA  COI
           Report on Sri Lanka. A number of key points stand out.

           Firstly, it should be noted that, broadly speaking, the 2012 COI
           Report develops an overall representation of  the  situation  in
           Sri  Lanka,  which  captures   the   contemporary   context   of
           instability, risk and widespread human rights violations despite
           the "post-conflict" environment in the island.

           Secondly, the 2012 COI has produced a number of sections,  which
           produce  a  thorough,  comprehensive  and   sometimes   detailed
           assessment in relation to specific themes and processes  through
           coverage of a broad range of sources encompassing  media,  state
           and non-governmental sources.

           Thirdly, it has also  been  noted  that  there  are  still  some
           sections where there  is  over-reliance  on  some,  particularly
           state, sources or the privileging of state sources through their
           prioritisation in the ordering of particular sections.

           Fourthly, that there is still a tendency  in  some  sections  to
           neglect either local and Diaspora news media sources (which as a
           whole are still  relatively  under-utilised)  on  the  one  hand
           and/or   non-governmental   reports   which   provide    thicker
           description and detail. The under-utilisation of a diversity  of
           sources   is   reproductive   of,   inter   alia,   error    and
           misrepresentation, a lack of balance, bias arising from the self-
           interest of the narrow sources  used  and/or  a  lack  of  depth
           and/or detail necessary to capture the current realities of  the
           on-the-ground situation on Sri Lanka.

           COIS: Thank you for the positive  comments  in  your  first  two
           points.
           We, however, do not  accept  your  third  point  that  there  is
           "privileging" or prioritisation of sources - which seems  mainly
           to apply to the section on the return of failed asylum  seekers.
           There was no intention to privilege "state sources through their
           prioritisation in the ordering of particular sections..." nor do
           we believe that this is the outcome of this section, rather  its
           order follows a description of the process of return.  No  extra
           weight is given to any particular source, and sources are quoted
           at length where information is relevant.
           Nor were there attempts were made to establish  a  hierarchy  of
           sources. Sources may appear to be in a hierarchy because of  the
           flow of information from general to specific. Additionally, some
           sources, such as the US State Department and  FCO  reports,  are
           useful at summarising situations and are good to start a section
           as overviews which may mean they appear earlier  in  a  section.
           However, there is no intention to suggest that one source should
           be given more weight than  another:  the  report  taken  at  its
           simplest level is a database of un-weighted information sources.
           In regard to your last point,  using  local  and  Diaspora  news
           media sources, we are open to additional suggestions  (it  would
           be helpful if the reviewer is able to suggest  more  sources  to
           complement those already provided) and will  look  to  diversify
           sources used in future reports.
           We also wish to add that the issue of "depth and / or  necessary
           detail" in sections is something we have not always agreed  with
           the reviewer. This in  part  reflects  different  views  on  the
           purpose of the report and the needs of users. Our  general  view
           is  to  provide  briefer  narrative  than  is   the   reviewer's
           preference in sections that provide political context for  users
           and focus on human rights in practice in the present.

           RECOMMENDATIONS

            . Diversify the range and  sort  of  sources  utilised  in  the
              report, encompassing foreign, Diaspora and local news  media,
              state  and  non-governmental  sources  throughout   all   the
              sections, where this is possible

            . Use a diversity of sources in order to corroborate claims and
              representations  about  the  country  situation,  themes  and
              processes in order to avoid error and  misrepresentation  and
              to editorially check  for  the  reliability  and  quality  of
              particular sources

            . Use a diversity of sources in order to provide  detailed  and
              in-depth understanding of the different  aspects  and  themes
              relevant to the country situation  so  that  the  context  is
              adequately represented  and  conforms  to  the  on-the-ground
              reality

            . Ensure that the structuring and layout of the report does not
              reproduce the  hierarchic  privileging  of  one  category  of
              sources or viewpoints over another.

           COIS: We will continue to seek to diversify sources further  and
           providing information of sufficient detail  to  assist  decision
           makers. It is worth  noting  that  COI  Service  has  a  bespoke
           information request service, providing bespoke  responses  which
           complement information provided in the report, providing further
           detail if required.
           We will be mindful of not creating hierarchies of sources. Thank
           you for your comments, suggested sources and recommendations."

 4. The detail of Dr  Rampton's  criticism  was  put  to  the  respondent's
    witness Mike Gallagher and is dealt with above.  The report written for
    these proceedings does not spend much time on the IAGCI evaluation.

 5. Dr Rampton has written expert reports in approximately  30  RMJ  funded
    individual appeals.  He has produced a  variety  of  reports  involving
    field work in Sri Lanka, between 2005 and 2011.  He regularly acts as a
    consultant to senior  diplomats  from  the  Republic  of  Ireland,  aid
    officials from DfID, and Norwegian MPs.

 6. Dr Rampton's report  dealt  first  with  the  Sri  Lankan  government's
    perceptions in  relation  to  the  risk  from  returning  Tamils.   The
    government continued to fear resurgence and its efforts to ensure  that
    the conflict would not re-emerge included increased  securitisation  of
    the Northern Province, a high military presence,  repression  of  Tamil
    political expression and of events such as Pongu Thamil and  Mahaveera,
    and increased requirements for Tamils to register.  The  situation  had
    moved from one of physical and/or coercive military action  during  and
    after the civil war  to  leadership  programmes  seeking  to  normalise
    militarisation, and social penetration,  for  example  by  intelligence
    penetration of schools and universities.

 7. Failed asylum seekers were seen as a threat on return because of  their
    links to the active Tamil diaspora, which was perceived as inimical  to
    the present structure in Sri Lanka and the fragile peace achieved since
    May 2009:

           "12. ...President Rajapaksa himself ... on multiple occasions in
           speeches and  interviews  has  blamed  the  Tamil  Diaspora  for
           driving the conflict and  for  making  impossible  demands  that
           prohibit a peaceful settlement. For this  reason  the  GoSL  has
           engaged in surveillance of the Tamil Diaspora  in  European  and
           Western societies as an attempt to prevent  and/or  contain  the
           (re-)emergence of the LTTE or another militant Tamil nationalist
           movement.  It is worth noting that the LTTE  did  operate  as  a
           global network with offices, funding networks, arms  procurement
           and commercial shipping arms located amongst and  directed  from
           pro-LTTE sections of the Tamil Diaspora.

           13. As a result,  the  GOSL's  attitude  towards  failed  asylum
           seekers is that they represent a potential  security  threat  to
           the Sri Lankan state and society and that any potential  suspect
           aligned to Tamil nationalism must therefore be subject to  close
           scrutiny and investigation  by  the  security  and  intelligence
           forces. It is also clear that since the TK Country Guidance case
           of 2009, significant evidence has emerged which  indicates  that
           returnees and failed asylum seekers  are  at  considerable  risk
           upon return to Sri Lanka and whilst much of this evidence  looks
           at the post-2009 period, there are also examples  that  pre-date
           this as well. Tamils Against  Genocide,  Freedom  from  Torture,
           Human Rights Watch and other journalistic  sources  have  either
           interviewed returnees and/or compiled multiple  cases  in  which
           failed asylum seekers and returnees have  been  subject  to  the
           adverse attention of the authorities,  degrading  conditions  of
           detention and in a significant number of the cases to torture by
           intelligence and security forces.

           Sources asserting that this is the  case  include  investigative
           journalists from the Sydney Morning Herald who have  engaged  in
           interviews   with   returnees   and   three   rights    advocacy
           organisations who have compiled their data from different cases,
           but who, in relation to at least two of these reports  have  the
           backing of MLRs (Medical-Legal Reports) for the cases they  have
           surveyed."

 8. After return to Sri  Lanka,  failed  asylum  seekers  are  identifiable
    because they typically lack identity cards and are travelling on  ETDs.
    After  setting  out  the  HRW,  FFT  and  TAG  evidence,   Dr   Rampton
    acknowledges that the BHC  in  Colombo,  the  British  Foreign  Office,
    Danish and Swiss delegations have stated that Sri  Lanka  is  safe  for
    returning Tamils, those comments  are  based  primarily  on  visits  to
    Katunuyake and not on monitoring returnees.

 9. He considered that there would be a  considerably  heightened  risk  on
    return, for those who might be able to give war crimes evidence,  about
    which the Sri Lankan authorities were very nervous:

           "18.  ...Where  individuals  have  revealed   information   that
           illuminates aspects of the civil war crimes issue (including the
           scale of  civilian  casualties),  the  GOSL  has  used  coercive
           pressure  and/or  threat  to  force   individuals   to   retract
           statements. Many international observers believe that  this  was
           the case with the five Tamil Doctors who  had  provided  medical
           services in the Vanni during the last phase of  the  civil  war,
           who  after  making  statements  about  the  extent  of  civilian
           casualties were  then  detained  and  accused  of  giving  false
           information to the media by the GoSL. Their original claims  and
           predicament was then backed up by Wikileaks cables  between  the
           US Embassy and Washington.

           The GOSL has also suffered increasing opprobrium and pressure in
           the wake of war crimes  allegations  amongst  the  international
           community including a successful US-backed resolution adopted at
           the UN Human Rights Council in March 2012. All of these  factors
           indicate that however hardnosed the GoSL  may  appear  at  times
           over the civil war crimes issue,  it  is  and  always  has  been
           concerned to keep as tight a lid as possible on the  release  of
           information about the issue. ..."

10. Colombo airport should be regarded simply as the first point of contact
    and re-profiling on return.  The risk of detention,  interrogation  and
    torture was higher after clearance than at the airport.

11. He could not comment on reports in the Tamil or Sinhala language media,
    since he did not read those languages.  However, given the pressure  on
    the media and the self-censorship by journalists, the lack  of  reports
    within Sri Lanka of the matters complained of outside  Sri  Lanka  were
    unsurprising.

12. Political changes since the civil war were in the direction of  greater
    state and Presidential control and a move towards authoritarianism:

           "20.   It  should  be  noted   that   the   intensification   of
           authoritarianism in Sri Lanka has impacted negatively upon  both
           the existing weak  checks  and  balances  that  existed  in  the
           criminal justice/policing system and upon media freedom, both of
           which have in turn impacted upon the dearth of  information  and
           accounts of torture, abuse and degrading treatment  suffered  by
           individuals in Sri Lanka for reasons that are outlined  in  more
           detail in the paragraphs below. The spread  of  authoritarianism
           has been widely noted in the media and academic sources but  can
           be illustrated through a centralization of political power which
           has removed whatever weak safeguards previously existed  in  the
           political  system.  For  instance,  the  passing  of  the   18th
           Amendment to the Constitution in September 2010,  which  removed
           the 17th Amendment  allowing  for  cross-party  selection  of  a
           constitutional council independent of the President which served
           to appoint judges and members of the aforementioned commissions,
           therefore acting as a check-and-balance on  presidential  power.
           This included overseeing commissions on policing and rights. The
           18th Amendment also removed term limits on presidential  office.
           So although many of the problems with both media freedom and the
           judiciary are long- standing, it should be noted that the spread
           of authoritarianism has centralized more power in the  hands  of
           the President, his family, his patronage machine and removed the
           weak existing checks that might prevent abuses operative  within
           state apparatuses. The recent impeachment of the  Chief  Justice
           Shirani Bandaranayake is yet another example of the  ability  of
           the President to ride roughshod  over  constitutional  procedure
           out of political fiat. These tendencies do have an  impact  upon
           the media and  its  ability  to  operate  freely  and  upon  the
           criminal justice system, both of which in turn will  affect  the
           willingness of people to speak  out  where  they  have  suffered
           abuse, torture and degrading treatment by  the  authorities  and
           security forces.

           21.  Firstly it should be noted that any complaint about torture
           or other mistreatment  exists  within  a  generalized  situation
           where access to due judicial process, rule of law and protection
           is problematic because the judicial system  lacks  independence,
           transparency, accountability and safeguards to  protect  victims
           of abuse and torture and witnesses to such  crimes.  This  makes
           the willingness of individuals  who  have  suffered  torture  or
           abuse, to report these incidents less likely as they have little
           assurance of protection from authorities in a situation where it
           is widely recognized that police and security forces are  widely
           implicated in forms of torture, degrading treatment and abuse in
           detention and in  order  to  obtain  confessions,  with  reports
           indicating  that  it  is  widespread  in  Sri  Lanka's  policing
           practices and not just utilized for high-profile targets.

           22.  These same reports also indicate regular flouting of habeas
           corpus, irregular trial procedures, intimidation of lawyers  and
           denial of access to legal counsel. Human rights advocacy reports
           have also stated that lawyers, the police and judges are  deeply
           inter-dependent socially,  professionally  and  financially  and
           this sometimes precludes the willingness of defence  lawyers  or
           judges to challenge police evidence. It is reasonable to  deduce
           that such a context acts as a significant  constraint  upon  the
           willingness of people to report  or  publicise  incidents  where
           they have suffered torture or abuse  and  therefore  in  turn  a
           check upon the quantity of cases that appear in the media."

13. Dr Rampton gave evidence.  He adopted his report. He was  asked  a  few
    supplementary questions in chief, which elicited that the 6th Amendment
    to the 1978 Constitution, which enshrined the unitary state in the  Sri
    Lankan constitution in 1985, had been used as a de  facto  proscription
    of TULF, and to prevent  the  admission  of  Tamils  to  the  political
    process in the 1980s.  It had not been used consistently over the years
    but remained in place.

14. In cross-examination, Dr  Rampton  repeated  his  evidence  as  to  the
    reasons why we should prefer evidence obtained in the  United  Kingdom,
    since there was almost no  post-arrival  monitoring  in  Sri  Lanka  of
    returnees.  There was a limited amount of monitoring by IOM,  but  only
    for a matter of months.  Their evidence might  be  contaminated,  given
    their intimate connections with the GOSL; it was  not  unreasonable  to
    assume that an organisation which  was  close  to  the  government  had
    compromised its ability to engage in a programme concerning the ongoing
    care of returned asylum seekers. He considered  it  likely  that  IOM's
    independence was compromised and that their monitoring was  inadequate.
    He had no evidence to support this assumption.

15. He regarded TamilNet as  a  reliable  source,  positioned  as  a  Tamil
    nationalist diaspora media source.  He had  no  reason  to  think  that
    their reports of attacks on  those  involved  with  TNA  or  TNPF  were
    inaccurate.

16. The FFT report concerned those who were lawfully in the United Kingdom;
    he had  broken  down  the  TAG  report,  which  he  accepted  concerned
    students, and the FFT evidence, in his report.  His own work focused on
    failed asylum seekers and he  had  also  drawn  on  evidence  which  he
    considered reliable from the World Socialist Website (www.wsws.org) and
    from the Australian Edmund Rice Centre (www.erc.org.au).

17. Other sources were his own knowledge and contacts within Sri Lanka  and
    the diaspora.  He had last conducted field work in Sri  Lanka  in  2010
    and kept in  ongoing  contact  by  Skype  and  other  modern  means  of
    communication, with friends and colleagues working in the NGO sector in
    Sri Lanka. The communication was oral and he kept no record of it.

18. He had no reason to doubt reports of abductions and arrests at or  near
    the airport, at bus stops and checkpoints. He relied upon  the  sources
    already given; he was not aware of any equivalent to the HRW,  FFT  and
    TAG  reports  from  Canada,  France,  Germany,  Switzerland  or   other
    international sources, at least since the end of the civil war.

19. Understanding Sri Lanka now required an ideological concept, a dominant
    'social imaginary'.  Research for his doctorate had focused on the  JVP
    rural counterstate movement in the 1971 and  1970s  insurgencies,  with
    the rise of a 'counter elite' among  rural  youth,  reproduced  in  the
    Sinhala language nationalist ideology.

20. In re-examination, Dr Rampton clarified the reliability of the  sources
    in the footnotes to his report. His report did not amount to 'going out
    on a limb' academically.  It needed to be  understood  in  context  and
    there was no reason to doubt the reliability of his sources.





                                 APPENDIX E

                            FREEDOM FROM TORTURE

    Professor Sir Nigel Rodley

       1. Professor Sir Nigel Rodley is Professor of Law at the  University
          of Essex and since 2001 has been the UK  expert  on  the  UNHCR's
          Human Rights Committee.  He has also been a trustee of FFT  since
          2003, and it was principally in that capacity  that  he  assisted
          the Tribunal.  He  is  an  honorary  Fellow  of  the  Faculty  of
          Forensic and Legal Medicine of the Royal College  of  Physicians.
          From 1993 to  2001  he  served  as  the  United  Nations  Special
          Rapporteur on Torture.

       2. In 2007, Professor Rodley was appointed by Sri  Lankan  President
          Mahinda Rajapaksa to serve on the International Independent Group
          of Eminent Persons  tasked  with  observing  the  workings  of  a
          Commission of Inquiry established by the Sri Lankan government to
          investigate  serious  human  rights  abuses.  He  has  been   the
          President of the International Commission of Jurists since 2008.

       3. As part of his work with FFT, Professor  Rodley  chaired  a  sub-
          committee of FFT's board of  trustees,  with  oversight  of  that
          organisation's submissions on  Sri  Lanka  to  the  UN  Committee
          Against Torture in November 2011, [Exhibits JP/2  and  JP/3:  see
          evidence of Jo  Pettitt]  and  its  13  September  2012  Briefing
          [Exhibit JP/4: see evidence of Jo Pettitt].

   Written evidence

       4. Professor Rodley adopted his  witness  statement  of  16  January
          2013. In this statement he notes that Freedom for  Torture  is  a
          charity, established in 1985 under the  name  Medical  Foundation
          for the Care of Victims of Torture. In 2011 it provided treatment
          to 1200 persons from 80 countries. It prepares  between  350  and
          600 medico-legal reports per year,  mainly  for  use  in  "asylum
          proceedings".

       5. Professor Rodley further recorded that based on its clinical work
          with Sri Lankan victims of torture,  FFT  has  developed  serious
          concerns about removals from the United Kingdom to Sri  Lanka  of
          Tamils with real or perceived associations, at  any  level,  with
          the LTTE. It considers that the United Kingdom's removals  policy
          for Sri Lanka is predicated on a flawed assessment  of  risk  and
          that UKBA's Operational Guidance Note  for  Sri  Lanka  of  April
          2012, and that its Country Policy Bulletins of  October  2012  do
          not properly reflect the risk of torture  on  return  for  Tamils
          with an actual or perceived connection to the LTTE. The risks  to
          such persons are set out in FFT's briefing paper of 13  September
          2012. Despite quoting from this briefing paper  in  its  December
          2012 bulletin, UKBA refused to revise its removal policy.

       6. Professor Rodley wrote to the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
          Department on 6 August 2012, alerting her to evidence held by FFT
          of the risk of  torture  to  Tamils  returning  from  the  United
          Kingdom, including evidence that two persons had been tortured in
          Sri Lanka after being forcibly returned there. As  a  consequence
          FFT was invited to attend a meeting, on 16 August 2012, with  the
          then Immigration Minister and a representative  of  Human  Rights
          Watch. At that meeting, UKBA refused to review its policy.

       7. Shortly thereafter Professor Rodley wrote to the Minister  asking
          him to agree to suspend removals  of  Tamils  whilst  the  UKBA's
          policy was changed to  reflect  the  evidence  presented  to  the
          Minister. In  a  response  of  29  August  2012  the  Immigration
          Minister stated, inter alia, that whilst it is acknowledged 'that
          there continues to be serious human rights abuses in  Sri  Lanka'
          there  is  as  yet  'no  reliable  evidence  that   the   return,
          particularly from the UK, of Sri Lankans of Tamil  ethnic  origin
          routinely results in the detention and potential torture of those
          individuals'. The Minister asked for  further  information  about
          the individuals whose circumstances were relied upon by FFT, such
          as Home Office reference numbers, so that the UKBA  could,  inter
          alia, substantiate the events that were alleged and then consider
          the matter in context. FFT declined to provide such information.

       8. In a letter of 26 November 2012, FFT  explained  its  actions  in
          this regard on the basis that (i) the FFT briefing  of  September
          2012 provided relevant context for  the  cases  and  reported  on
          patterns in its research; (ii) the information sought by UKBA  is
          confidential and FFT is not at liberty to disclose the identities
          of the relevant  individuals;  (iii)  as  an  expert  witness  in
          proceedings  against  the  Secretary  of  State  for   the   Home
          Department it would not be appropriate for FFT  to  discuss  case
          details directly with the UKBA; and (iv) the purpose of the  UKBA
          seeking the identities of the relevant individuals  was  queried,
          given that the veracity of a claim of torture is not dependent on
          the successful outcome  of  an  asylum  application  because  (a)
          conclusions made in relation to an asylum  applications  are  not
          solely dependent on the fact of past torture and (b) FFT  Medico-
          legal reports involve forensic testing of torture allegations and
          are subject to stringent clinical and legal review processes.

       9. Professor Rodley stated in his witness statement that he strongly
          agreed with FFT's refusal to supply UKBA with identifying details
          of the cases included in the organisation's  research,  asserting
          that to make such disclosures would:

                 (i)   involve a serious breach of  client  confidentiality,
                 as well  as  being  impracticable,  since  it  would  be  a
                 complicated and  labour-intensive  process  to  obtain  the
                 consent of each individual;

                 (ii)   given  the  high  regard  in  which  FFT  was  held,
                 including expressly by UKBA, he  found  it  'difficult'  to
                 understand why the UKBA was unable to accept FFT's research
                 findings without verifying them from its own database;

                 (iii)       there was concern that UKBA's request could  be
                 construed as supportive of efforts by other governments  to
                 undermine human rights research by challenging the  methods
                 of  presenting  research,   including   anonymisation   and
                 aggregation of data;

                 (iv)  any decision  to  identify  the  individuals  in  its
                 research would act as a deterrent to others asked  to  take
                 part in the organisation's future research projects;

                 (v)   disclosure would not be  in  the  best  interests  of
                 FFT's clients; and that

                 (vi)  as an  expert  witness  in  proceedings  against  the
                 Secretary of State for the Home Department, it would not be
                 appropriate for FFT to discuss case details  directly  with
                 the UKBA.

      10. On 26 November 2012, FFT also wrote to the  Treasury  Solicitor's
          Department registering a complaint as to the contents  of  UKBA's
          October 2012 Policy Bulletin, in particular  asserting  that  the
          Bulletin:

           (i)  downplayed  'the  forensic  nature  of  the  organisation's
           evidence based on its medico-legal reports and its  role  as  an
           independent expert witness when preparing such reports';

           (ii) misrepresented the organisation's calls for a suspension of
           forced returns of Tamils to Sri Lanka and,

           (iii) misrepresented the conclusions drawn by  the  organisation
           from data presented in its 13 September briefing.

      11. The Treasury Solicitor, in a letter to the  Administrative  Court
          office on 4 December 2012, acknowledged that  complaint,  but  at
          the date of Professor's Rodley's statement, FFT had not  received
          a substantive response to it.

   Oral evidence

      12. In his  oral  evidence,  Professor  Rodley  adopted  his  witness
          statement and was cross-examined.  He accepted  that  even  where
          there was documented evidence of physical or  psychiatric  damage
          done to a person,  that  alone  would  not  demonstrate  that  an
          account of torture was true.  The clinician's assessment of  such
          harm was not probative of any connection to the LTTE; the most it
          could prove was the nature of the harm received by an individual,
          and its consistency with the account that individual gave of  the
          way in which he had received it.

      13. He had sat in on a number  of  examinations  of  alleged  torture
          victims.  He  had  been  surprised  how  forensic  the   doctors'
          questioning was, and how often they picked up on inconsistencies.
           An individual's reaction was unpredictable:   they  might  speak
          calmly of the abuse, but begin to cry when recounting an incident
          of humiliation, and that was a sign of truth.

      14. He had confidence in the research by FFT:  looking at  the  whole
          data set could allow the researcher to notice something which was
          not apparently significant  in  an  individual  case.   That  was
          probably true of all research:   once  the  general  pattern  was
          clear, one or two divergent cases were probably unimportant.  The
          use of aggregated data was not problematic, in his  opinion,  and
          the Tribunal was not entitled to look behind the aggregation:  he
          considered it highly implausible that FFT's  experienced  doctors
          would 'have the wool  pulled  over  their  eyes'  by  individuals
          claiming to have been tortured. On a case by  case  basis,  there
          were all  kinds  of  ways  to  break  down  the  analysis  of  an
          individual case, but unless most cases  were  wrong,  that  would
          have no effect on the overall pattern.

      15. He had worked with the testimony of torture for a very long time.
           He had been UN Special Rapporteur on Torture for nine years, and
          had  spent  17  years  at  Amnesty  International.   As   Special
          Rapporteur, one was often dealing with  written  submissions  and
          not  often  coming  to  case-specific  conclusions;  instead,  he
          reached  general  conclusions  on  the  basis  of  the  type   of
          information provided to him, and its source.  He had a  sense  of
          what  was  possible,  the  type  of  questioning   and   of   the
          organisational reliability of various bodies.  He knew what kinds
          of information could be trusted, specifically that  from  Amnesty
          International and FFT.  Other  organisations  were  more  careful
          before asking governments to respond.

      16. Asked whether a medico-legal report (MLR)  alone  was  sufficient
          evidence of torture, without a successful asylum claim, Professor
          Rodley said that he considered the  evidence  represented  by  an
          MLR, in certain circumstances,  to  be  more  reliable  than  the
          decision of an asylum  decision  maker.   Caseworkers,  and  even
          Courts,  could  make  mistakes,  depending  on  the  quality   of
          representation  before  them.   It  was  more  likely   that   an
          experienced forensic medical specialist would reach  the  correct
          conclusion.  In such cases, the harm  done  was  more  conclusive
          than the individual's account of how it was acquired.

      17. Asked why FFT insisted on the confidentiality of  the  underlying
          data, Professor Rodley responded that he trusted the data and did
          not understand why the government wished  to  examine  it,  given
          that FFT was a highly respected organisation.  He  did  not  know
          whether attempts had been made to obtain the informed consent  of
          the individuals concerned, but he was  aware  that  attempts  had
          been made to  avoid  duplication.   Where  the  individuals  were
          clients of FFT, it might be possible to trace them; however, many
          of the cases relied upon were referrals from elsewhere, where FFT
          had less data.  He did  not  know  himself  what  the  split  was
          between clients and referrals.

      18. Professor Rodley was asked  a  number  of  questions  which  were
          outwith his primary area of expertise, relating to the signing of
          blank confessions, 'escapes', and exit routes.

               a) Escapes.        Professor Rodley was invited  to  comment
                  as to the relevance of the fact  that  the  13  September
                  briefing did not identify whether persons included within
                  the respective data sets had (i) escaped  from  detention
                  (ii) had warrants outstanding against them or  (iii)  had
                  left Sri Lanka using their own  passports.  His  position
                  was that the  information  was  irrelevant  both  to  the
                  assessment of the  necessary  treatment  to  give  to  an
                  individual, and to the assessment of  the  likelihood  of
                  that individual having been tortured  in  the  past,  and
                  therefore  was  not  analysed  in  the   aggregation   of
                  information for the Briefing.

               b) Confessions.    Speaking about the allegation  of  Tamils
                  being required to  sign  'confession'  documents  in  the
                  Sinhala language, a language they usually could not read,
                  Professor Rodley said that it was not at all unusual  for
                  the authorities to brandish such a document, even where a
                  person did not know what he had signed.

               c) Returnees from other countries.  Professor Rodley was not
                  aware whether there had been any  international  research
                  that suggested that Tamils  returned  from  other  places
                  associated with  the  LTTE  were  at  risk,  although  he
                  observed that it was common  knowledge  that  the  United
                  Kingdom has the largest organised Tamil diaspora.

               d) Exit methods.   Professor Rodley was unable to assist  as
                  to ways in which individuals might  leave  Sri  Lanka  if
                  they were of adverse interest to the  authorities.   That
                  was of no relevance in analysing their medical  condition
                  and needs.  The method  of  leaving  Sri  Lanka  was  not
                  determinative of how a  person  had  been  treated  while
                  there. He could not say it was of no  relevance  for  the
                  Tribunal:  he did not know enough about the situation  in
                  Sri Lanka.  He felt that it was 'clutching at straws'  to
                  seek to discount all the individual cases on the basis of
                  how they left the country, or the circumstances of  their
                  leaving detention.

    Ms Jo Pettitt

      19. Ms Pettitt has been employed as a  Researcher  at  FFT  (formerly
          known as the Medical  Foundation  for  the  Care  of  Victims  of
          Torture) since September 2010.  From 2005 to 2010 she worked as a
          Research Officer in the Research  and  Information  Unit  of  the
          Immigration Advisory Service (IAS).  She published  a  number  of
          research papers whilst employed with IAS  and  has  undertaken  a
          number of research projects whilst employed with FFT. Ms  Pettitt
          holds a BA in Social Anthropology from the University of  Durham,
          an MA in Anthropology of  Development  from  Goldsmiths  College,
          University  of  London,  and  a  Post-Graduate   Certificate   in
          Participatory Research from London Metropolitan University and  a
          Post-Graduate  Diploma  in  Applied  Social  Studies   from   the
          University Bristol.

      21. In  her  witness  statement,  Ms  Pettitt  explained  that  FFT's
          relatively new Country Reporting Programme had as its object  the
          systematic investigation and reporting of evidence  and  patterns
          of torture in particular countries, with a view to holding states
          accountable for such practices, using international human  rights
          mechanisms, for example UNCAT.  Sri  Lanka  was  the  first  such
          report which FFT had prepared.

      22. FFT's primary source for such research was  the  individual  MLRs
          prepared by its own medico legal report service.   FFT  MLRs  are
          detailed reports  prepared  to  Istanbul  Protocol  standards  by
          specialist clinicians trained to document an individual's history
          of torture  and  its  physical  and  psychological  consequences,
          through a process of clinical  examination  and  assessment.  The
          clinicians were required in each case to consider and comment  on
          the possibility of  fabrication  of  evidence  by  an  individual
          claimant.

      23. For research purposes, she had  collected  both  qualitative  and
          quantitative data from relevant MLRs, recorded and aggregated it.
          The  data  was  then  systematically  analysed  with  a  view  to
          providing an accurate description of the patterns observed across
          the data. Where relevant,  patterns  relevant  to  aggregates  of
          particular  subsets  of  the  data  sample,  such  as  ethnic  or
          political profile, were elicited and described.

      24. FFT held a rich archive of MLRs relating to torture practices  in
          Sri Lanka during the civil war, and continued to receive  a  high
          volume of referrals relating to Sri  Lankan  nationals.   Between
          January 2010 and  June  2012,  there  had  been  240  Sri  Lankan
          referrals for FFT's treatment services. Referrals for  Sri  Lanka
          constituted the vast majority of the total referrals to FFT.

      25. For the UNCAT submission,  Ms  Pettitt  had  used  the  following
          criteria to select the sample group: 'all MLRs produced  for  Sri
          Lankan clients by FFT from January 2010 to September  2011'  with
          i) evidence of detention and torture from May  2009  onwards  and
          ii) consent to use the MLR data for research.  35 of the 65  MLRs
          produced for  Sri  Lankan  clients  during  the  relevant  period
          satisfied the criteria.   There  is  no  information  on  the  30
          clients who did not give their consent  to  use  their  data  for
          research.  Quantitative and qualitative data was  extracted  from
          MLRs for the 35 who did consent,  and  was  then  anonymised  and
          analysed.

      26. For the briefing to the Minister of  State  for  Immigration,  Ms
          Pettitt sought to investigate and report on evidence and patterns
          of torture perpetrated in Sri Lanka since the civil war ended  in
          May 2009, limited to individuals detained and tortured  following
          voluntary return from the UK.  The sample group were Sri  Lankans
          who had been lawfully present in the United Kingdom  with  visas,
          who returned to Sri Lanka voluntarily after the end of the  civil
          war in 2009, and were detained and tortured.

      27. The sample group was then subdivided  into  the  following  three
          groups:

           (i)   Group 1 [6 cases]: Cases forensically documented by  FFT's
           Medico-Legal Report Service, January 2010 - October 2011,  where
           the detention and torture occurred from May 2009 onwards.

           (ii)  Group 2 [6 cases]: Cases forensically documented by  FFT's
           Medico-Legal Report Service, November 2011 - August  2012  where
           the detention and torture occurred from 2010 onwards.

           (iii) Group 3 [12 cases]: Cases referred to FFT's London  Centre
           for clinical treatment, November 2011 - August  2012,  referrals
           having been made by either health and social care  professionals
           [10  cases],  the  Refugee  Council  [1   case]   or   a   legal
           representative [1 case].

      28. The 13 September 2012 FFT Briefing concludes as follows:


           "When looked at together, these 24 cases of Tamil returnees from
           the UK with a  real  or  perceived  LTTE  affiliation  who  were
           targeted for detention and torture in Sri Lanka demonstrate that
           torture is on-going despite the conclusion  of  the  civil  war.
           They further indicate that (a) the fact that an  individual  did
           not face adverse consequences  in  the  past  because  of  their
           actual or perceived association with the LTTE at  any  level  is
           not decisive now in assessing risk on return; because (b) return
           from the UK specifically has been a factor  in  the  Sri  Lankan
           authorities' decision to detain with a view to obtaining further
           intelligence about historical or current LTTE activity  in  both
           Sri Lanka and the UK. They raise the  strong  concern  that  Sri
           Lankan Tamils who have lived in the UK, with a previous or  live
           LTTE association  (actual  or  perceived),  are  being  targeted
           because they are suspected by the Sri Lankan authorities of  (i)
           being engaged in political activities while living  in  the  UK;
           and/or (ii) having knowledge about  LTTE  activity  in  the  UK.
           There should be a pause in forcible removals of  Tamils  to  Sri
           Lanka while the UK Border Agency's policy  on  removals  to  Sri
           Lanka is changed to properly reflect this evidence."

      29. In her statement Ms Pettitt said that the data used for Groups  1
          and 2 was collated from MLRs and other relevant information  held
          in FFT case files, including, for example, their  UKBA  Statement
          of Evidence Forms or witness statements produced for their asylum
          claim.


    Data group 1 (FFT UNCAT submission)

      30. 35 individuals had been considered in the  UNCAT  submission  and
          subsequent report.  Nine were lawfully in the United Kingdom  and
          had returned to Sri Lanka  voluntarily.   Six  of  them  returned
          after the end of the civil war in May 2009 (four in 2009, one  in
          2010 and one in 2011), and those are the individuals for whom the
          report assists us.

      31. Five of the six were Tamils with an  association  with  the  LTTE
          whilst  in  Sri  Lanka.   The  sixth,  an  individual  of   mixed
          Tamil/Sinhalese ethnicity, had an immediate family connection  to
          the LTTE, or with an active opposition politician, before  coming
          to the United Kingdom.  Four were from the Northern  Province  or
          east (the Tamil homelands), one was  from  Colombo  and  for  one
          individual the place of origin was not specified.  In each  case,
          it was considered that the Sri Lankan authorities were  aware  of
          the LTTE connection.

      32. All six were tortured on return, then came  back  to  the  United
          Kingdom and claimed asylum. At the report date, two  of  the  six
          individuals  had  been  granted  asylum  (one  after  an   appeal
          hearing), one was awaiting an asylum decision, and the outcome of
          the three other asylum applications was unknown.

      33. In each of the six cases,  the  individuals  passed  through  the
          airport but were detained, either at home  or  at  a  checkpoint,
          within a month of arriving back in Sri Lanka.  Two of  them  were
          detained twice. Detentions were for periods ranging  between  two
          days and three months; four of them were detained for less than a
          month.  All but one of the six was asked about their  activities,
          contact with or knowledge about the LTTE in  the  United  Kingdom
          (diaspora  activities).   Three  of  them   did   have   diaspora
          activities, having attended at  least  one  demo  in  the  United
          Kingdom, though only one was an LTTE supporter.

      34. Five of the six individuals had numerous scars  which  were  new,
          between three and five months old.   Of  these,  on  average,  11
          scars per person were attributed by the clinician to torture.  In
          three cases, some scars  were  considered  to  be  diagnostic  of
          torture.  Three of the individuals in group 1 were also  assessed
          as having reached the diagnostic threshold for PTSD and three for
          depression.


    Group 2 (FFT Briefing to Minister of State for Immigration)

      35. There were six Tamil individuals in this group, male and  female,
          whose cases had been forensically  documented  by  FFT's  Medico-
          Legal Report Service between November 2011 and August  2012.   In
          each of the six cases, the appellants had LTTE  connections,  and
          in four cases, they also had  family  connections  to  the  LTTE.
          Three of them had been tortured by the authorities before  coming
          to the United Kingdom for the first time.

      36. Five of Group 2 came from the Tamil homelands in the Northern and
          Eastern  Provinces;  one  was  from   Colombo.    Four   returned
          voluntarily in 2011 and another in  2012.   The  evidence  showed
          that all six had been detained and tortured, in  2010  or  later,
          had returned to the United Kingdom, and then claimed asylum.  Two
          were granted asylum on application; one was granted asylum  after
          appealing; another was awaiting  a  decision  and  there  was  no
          information  about  the  asylum  claims  of  the  remaining   two
          individuals. Five of the individuals originated from  either  the
          Northern Province or East of Sri Lanka, and one from Colombo.

      37. One member of group 2 was detained at the airport on arrival.  Of
          the other five, three were picked up at home  and  detained;  one
          was picked up in a street near their home, one while reporting at
          a police station.  Three were taken to the place of detention  in
          a white van.  Three were detained for less than a month  (one  of
          them for less than a week), but one was  detained  for  over  six
          months.

      38. Five of the six detentions ended with  the  individual  paying  a
          bribe and being released, but one person was rearrested, detained
          and tortured again the day after release.  All  but  one  of  the
          group were  questioned  about  their  actual  or  perceived  LTTE
          connections, including  their  own  diaspora  activities  in  the
          United Kingdom and those of others known to them; the authorities
          asked questions  about  their  participation  in  demonstrations,
          fundraising for  the LTTE, and  the  whereabouts  of  known  LTTE
          members residing in the United Kingdom.

      39. In this group there were on average 17  scars  per  person  which
          were  considered  attributable  to  torture;  four  of  the   six
          individuals  in  group  2  had  scars  considered  diagnostic  of
          torture, and five also had scars which were typical  of  torture.
          The age of the scarring on all six individuals  was  assessed  as
          between three and eight months old.  Four of them  were  assessed
          as having reached the diagnostic threshold for PTSD, and four for
          depression.

    Group 3 (treatment referrals to FFT's London centre)

      40. There were twelve individuals in group 3, two women and ten  men,
          all Tamils.  The source of the data for Group 3 was  the  details
          provided by the referrers on the referral  forms  each  submitted
          and was necessarily more limited than the detailed information in
          the MLRs which were the source of the data in  groups  1  and  2.
          Seven of them returned to Sri Lanka in 2011, and  five  in  2012.
          One was detained on arrival, ten more  within  a  month,  but  no
          details were available for the 11th  individual  in  relation  to
          when he was detained.

      41. Five of group 3 were arrested after informants identified them as
          having  LTTE  associations.   Six  of  this  group  did  have  an
          association with the LTTE.  Two of those arrested reported  being
          questioned about diaspora activities  (their  own  and  those  of
          others) while in the United Kingdom.

      42. Four of group 3 were referred to FFT for  clinical  treatment  in
          2011 and eight in 2012.  Ms Pettitt stated that six of  them  had
          been fully assessed, and accepted for treatment  by  FFT.   Three
          were current FFT clients, the other three having been treated and
          discharged.  Three of the six had been accepted as refugees;  the
          asylum decisions on the other three cases were still pending.

      43. Of the six not accepted by FFT, four had been referred  elsewhere
          and not accepted as FFT clients.  The other two had not  kept  in
          contact, and their files had been closed.

      44. In cross-examination, Ms Pettitt explained that  given  that  the
          purpose of her research was to investigate patterns  of  torture,
          she had not examined the cases of individuals whose allegation of
          torture had been rejected by FFT.  Her assumption, which she  had
          not specifically researched, was that most such  cases  would  be
          filtered out at the intake stage of the organisation's process.

      45. She had worked from documents and records: she had not met any of
          the individuals whose cases she  had  documented.   The  material
          before her contained more  information  about  some  individuals'
          claimed LTTE associations than she had detailed in the  Briefing.
          The additional information had been omitted in order to  preserve
          the anonymity of those individuals.  For those in  group  1,  the
          briefing did not provide a breakdown as between those with direct
          LTTE links, and those with familial  links.   Information  as  to
          whether the  authorities  were  aware  of  such  connections  was
          derived  from  the  information  given  by  the  former  detainee
          themselves when being assessed by a FFT  clinician.   There  were
          occasions when individuals stated that they did not know why they
          had been detained.

      46. The report contained  reference  to  certain  individuals  having
          signed a 'confession'.  In cross-examination, Ms Pettitt accepted
          that, although a particular individual  might  believe  they  had
          signed a confession, where the document they had  signed  was  in
          the Sinhala language, which usually they  could  not  read,  they
          could not be certain what they had signed.  For that reason,  she
          had placed the word 'confession' in inverted commas.

      47. The data derived from the cases in group 3 had not  been  derived
          from clinical scrutiny and assessment by  clinical  practitioners
          at the FFT. It was taken from referral forms completed by  social
          services, and in two cases, by a  legal  representative  and  the
          Refugee Council.  She had not sought to identify  any  equivalent
          data set  from  other  countries  with  a  large  LTTE  diaspora,
          indicating a high incidence of torture for  returnees  from  such
          country or countries.

      48. In re-examination  Ms  Pettitt  stated  that  she  considered  it
          extremely unlikely that NHS clinicians would refer  a  person  to
          FFT where they did not believe that person  to  be  a  victim  of
          torture.   Data  from  cases  where  individuals  had  not   been
          considered to be victims of torture would not have any  relevance
          or usefulness in her research and she had sought such data.

                                 APPENDIX F

                             HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH

    Brad Adams

    1. Mr Adams is the Asia Director of Human Rights Watch in New York. His
       evidence was produced at the  Tribunal's  request,  after  the  main
       hearings.  He had overall managerial responsibility  for  the  Human
       Rights Watch report:  "We will teach you a lesson:  sexual  violence
       against Tamils by the Sri Lankan security forces" which was released
       on 26  February  2013,  and  of  which  Ms  Hogg's  research  was  a
       component.  It was prepared for  the  March  2013  UN  Human  Rights
       Council sessions.

    2. The sequence of events in relation to Mr Adams' statements  is  that
       on 12 March 2013, the Tribunal of its own motion  directed  that  he
       provide a witness statement and make himself  available  for  cross-
       examination on 15 March 2012 by video link from the  United  States.
       We wished Mr Adams to assist us in  understanding  the  sequence  of
       events in relation to the HRW reports.

    3. On 14 March, an  urgent  application  was  received  from  Ms  Dinah
       Pokempner, HRW's General Counsel,  seeking  the  discharge  of  that
       order for the following reasons: first, that none of the parties had
       sought Mr Adams' evidence;  second,  that  the  respondent  was  not
       proposing to argue that the timing of HRW's reports was  manipulated
       in anyway; third, that the arrangements for the video linking and Mr
       Adams' costs of giving evidence  had  not  been  considered  and  in
       California, where he lives, it would be night when the Tribunal  was
       sitting; and that, in accordance with the overriding objective,  the
       Tribunal was able to deal justly and fairly with the case without Mr
       Adams' evidence. The parties confirmed that none of them  wished  to
       cross-examine Mr Adams and we therefore  discharged  the  order  for
       oral evidence by video link.

    4. We have not therefore been able to see his evidence  tested  in  the
       normal way.  That  is  unfortunate,  since  several  previous  Human
       Rights Watch press releases and reports in 2012 seemed to have  been
       timed to appear very close to the dates of charter flights returning
       asylum seekers to Sri Lanka.  The same appeared to be the case  with
       the FFT reports in 2012.

    5. Mr Adams' first witness statement confirmed that the press  releases
       in May and September 2012 had been released, close to  the  date  of
       the relevant charter flights, in order to influence both the  United
       Kingdom public and  government  to  prevent  the  intended  returns.
       However, he denied any link between the February 2013 flight and the
       latest report. He confirmed that as a Human Rights Watch consultant,
       Ms Hogg was aware that she was not permitted voluntarily to disclose
       unpublished names or information without permission, which would  be
       withheld if confidentiality issues were at stake.

    6. In a second statement of 13 March 2013, Mr Adams confirmed  that  it
       was not Human Rights Watch's case that every Tamil returned  to  Sri
       Lanka would be at risk, but referred the Tribunal to his full report
       for the detailed risk conclusions[30].  The report was  based  on  a
       sample  of  75  individuals  which   it   was   accepted   was   not
       representative.  There was no statistical analysis of  the  division
       between those detained before and after the civil war.

    7. Examples given included recent detentions, both in  official  places
       of detention and other places,  and  the  methods  of  torture  used
       included rape and sexual abuse, as well as:

        "...forceful slapping and punching; sustained kicking all over  the
        body; stomping on limbs with  hard  boots;  beatings  with  batons,
        rifle butts, electric cables  or  wires,  and  sand-filled  plastic
        pipes;  being  thrown  against  a  wall;  hair   pulling;   partial
        suffocation by inhaling in a petrol-infused plastic  bag;  twisting
        fingers and limbs; and beating the soles of feet.

        Also common were burning with a  heated  metal  rod  on  the  back,
        thighs,  and  soles  of  feet;  burning  with  glowing  cigarettes;
        repeated suspension from a metal bar with both hands  tied  at  the
        wrists; suspension upside  down;  sleep  deprivation  including  by
        flashing lights, loud noises, being poked with  sticks,  or  having
        dry chili powder thrown into one's  eyes;  and  having  one's  head
        pushed into dirty water."

    8. The recommendations Human Rights Watch had made to the GOSL were  as
       follows:

              "V. Recommendations


              To the Government of Sri Lanka

        a. Investigate all allegations of rape and other sexual violence by
           Sri Lankan security forces, including from  the  armed  conflict
           period as well as the years since. Prosecute  those  responsible
           for these  crimes,  including  persons  with  command  or  other
           superior responsibility, in proceedings that meet  international
           fair  trial   standards.   Publicize   the   outcome   of   such
           prosecutions,  including  by  providing   information   on   the
           punishments meted out and the redress and compensation  provided
           to victims;
        b. Repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA),  and  abolish  the
           system of detention without charge or trial;
        c. Immediately lift access restrictions imposed by the Presidential
           Task Force on Resettlement, Reconstruction and Security  in  the
           Northern Province (PTF) so that;
        d. Release all individuals who have been arrested  under  emergency
           or anti-terrorism laws, unless they are charged with  recognized
           criminal offenses. Conduct prompt trials that meet international
           due process standards;
        e. Make available to family members the names and locations of  all
           individuals detained for  suspected  involvement  in  the  LTTE,
           including  those  in  rehabilitation  centers  and   undisclosed
           detention sites, and facilitate family visits;
        f. Ensure detainees' right to legal representation and access to  a
           lawyer of their choosing  upon  being  taken  into  custody  and
           thereafter.  Amend  current  regulations  to  ensure  that   all
           detainees may have legal counsel present  during  interrogations
           if they so choose,
        g. Permit all detainees to be examined by  an  independent  medical
           practitioner immediately after they are detained  and  following
           each period of questioning, if they request such examinations;
        h. Establish, maintain, and publicize a centralized database of all
           detainees,  including  those  detained   for   "rehabilitation",
           providing the dates  of  arrest  and  detention,  the  authority
           issuing such orders, and all transfer,  release  and  revocation
           orders;
        i. Ensure all ranks of the security forces, including the military,
           police,  Criminal  Investigation   Department,   and   Terrorist
           Investigation Division, receive regular and appropriate training
           on civilian protection;
        j. Institute a reparations program in accordance with international
           standards for all victims of  serious  human  rights  violations
           committed  during  the  armed  conflict,  including  victims  of
           custodial torture;
        k. Provide reproductive and sexual  health  services,  and  psycho-
           social support for all victims of alleged rape and other  sexual
           violence.  Permit   appropriate   domestic   and   international
           nongovernmental  organizations  to  provide  these  services  to
           individuals in northern and eastern Sri Lanka;
        l. Ratify the following  international  conventions:  the  Optional
           Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and  Other  Cruel,
           Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the  Rome  Statute
           of the  International  Criminal  Court;  and  the  International
           Convention for the  Protection  of  All  Persons  from  Enforced
           Disappearance;
        m. Invite and  facilitate  the  visits  of  UN  special  procedures
           including the UN special rapporteur on torture, the  UN  Working
           Group on Arbitrary Detention, the UN Working Group  on  Enforced
           Disappearances, the UN special rapporteur  on  violence  against
           women, and the UN special  rapporteur  on  the  independence  of
           judges and lawyers. "

    9. Mr Adams' second statement repeated that Human Rights Watch had  not
       had any knowledge of the date of the 28 February 2013 flight and had
       not timed its report for that flight.

       Ms Charu Lata Hogg

   10. Ms  Hogg  is  an  Associate  Fellow  with  the  Chatham  House  Asia
       Programme.  Although her evidence  was  not  expressly  tendered  on
       behalf of Human Rights Watch, it emerged during the first day of her
       evidence that the research which underlay her witness statements had
       been undertaken for Human Rights  Watch  and  was  fettered  by  the
       contractual provisions of her  consultancy  arrangement  with  Human
       Rights Watch.  It was published at the end of  February  2013  in  a
       Human Rights Watch document,  "We Will Teach You a  Lesson":  Sexual
       Violence against Tamils by Sri Lankan Security Forces on 26 February
       2013.

   11. Ms Hogg described  herself  as  having  '14  years  of  grass  roots
       experience in reporting on human rights  and  developmental  issues'
       for national and international media in India and Sri Lanka. She had
       travelled  extensively  in  both  countries,  interacting  with  all
       parties and governments, including as an election monitor.  She  was
       last in Sri Lanka in 2008, the year before the civil war ended.

   12. From 2003-2006 she was a Sri Lanka consultant with the Coalition  to
       Stop the Use of Child Soldiers , helping develop a policy  framework
       to address the situation of child soldiers in pre and  post-conflict
       scenarios. She later worked as  a  consultant  International  Alert,
       developing work on Sri Lanka and India to examine the potential that
       shared economic interests could play  in  building  regional  peace.
       From 2007-2009, she worked for Human Rights Watch as  a  South  Asia
       researcher  (India,  Sri  Lanka,  Bangladesh  and  Nepal)  and   she
       continues to work for them as an external consultant.

   13. Ms Hogg provided three reports:  the first on  21  January  2013,  a
       Supplementary Report on 28 January 2013, and the third, described as
       her Second Supplementary Report, on 12  March  2013.  In  her  first
       report, Ms Hogg indicated that she had interviewed 143  individuals,
       including 13  Tamil  asylum  seekers  with  the  profile  of  having
       returned to Sri Lanka, been  tortured,  and  then  returned  to  the
       United Kingdom  to  claim  asylum;  one  deportee  from  the  United
       Kingdom; two former Sri Lankan MPs;  and  eight  representatives  of
       civil society organisations.  Two of the  13  Tamil  asylum  seekers
       were among those considered in the HRW submissions in the summer and
       early autumn of 2012.

   14. Ms Hogg set out the restrictions on what she was able to provide  by
       way of information thus:

          "2. The names, place of residence  and  as  well  as  potentially
          incriminating details of the  dates  and  locations  of  victims'
          detention and abuse have in the majority been withheld to address
          concerns about their vulnerability to possible reprisals  by  Sri
          Lankan security forces should information in  this  report  enter
          the public domain. I have included  information  from  sources  I
          consider reliable based on my knowledge  and  experience  on  Sri
          Lanka. I have provided as much detail on the sources  as  can  be
          safely provided. Given the vulnerability of sources in Sri Lanka,
          I would like to request the court  to  omit  mentioning  specific
          names and details on individual sources in the decision  as  this
          could potentially lead to the identification of these sources  by
          Sri Lankan authorities and make them vulnerable  to  future  ill-
          treatment."

   15. After setting out  the  political  history  of  Sri  Lanka  and  the
       questions put to her, as well as the documents before her,  Ms  Hogg
       quoted  Dr  Pakiasothy  Saravanamuttu  of  the  Centre  for   Policy
       Alternatives, as follows:

          "30.   ..."The current government in  Sri  Lanka  is  strong  but
          insecure because of a variety of factors which  include  on-going
          allegations of  war  crimes  in  its  defeat  of  the  LTTE;  any
          development  which   could   potentially   challenge   its   main
          achievement, the defeat of the  LTTE,  and  thereby  contest  its
          success; the fear  of  loss  of  protection  should  the  leaders
          suddenly be stripped of official position and power; and  finally
          the fact that the government is entrenching a dynastic project."

   16.  Despite  its  majority  in  the  2010  elections,  the   GOSL   was
       authoritarian and sought  to  exercise  'a  stranglehold'  over  Sri
       Lanka. A three-member advisory  panel  appointed  by  UN  Secretary-
       General Ban Ki Moon in 2010 had still not been  permitted  to  visit
       Sri Lanka; it was widely viewed as the precursor to a full-blown war
       crimes trial.  The experts' report had been released in April  2011,
       without a visit to Sri Lanka, and found and  criticised  widespread,
       serious human rights abuses in the final phase of the civil war,  by
       both the Sri Lankan government forces and the LTTE.   The  LLRC  was
       the GOSL's response to international calls for a war  crimes  trial,
       but its remit  had  been  limited  and  international  human  rights
       organisations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International  and
       ICG had refused to appear before it, on legitimacy grounds.

   17. At paragraph 44 of her report, Ms Hogg stated that:

          "44.   The situation for minorities in Sri Lanka  appears  bleak.
          The state continues to fail to  acknowledge  legitimate  minority
          grievances that led to the  three-decade-long  conflict  and  has
          made little attempt at promoting and protecting  minority  rights
          and freedoms. Since the end of the armed conflict there has  been
          almost no mention of the causes for the conflict or the existence
          of  legitimate  grievances  of  Tamils  and  Muslims.  The  armed
          conflict was fought and won with the rhetoric of it being a  'war
          on terror' undermining the existence  of  grievances.  Since  its
          victory, the government has not sought to address the root causes
          of the  conflict,  despite  calls  by  local  minority  political
          parties and many international governments to offer  a  political
          settlement acceptable to Tamils and Muslims. This  together  with
          restrictions on freedoms and minority rights, and aversion to any
          effort on justice, accountability and reconciliation is  seen  by
          minorities as part of the agenda to suppress them."

   18. She recorded the restrictions on press freedom and  the  attacks  on
       journalists.  Those who aligned themselves with western  perceptions
       of  what   had   happened   in   Sri   Lanka   were   described   as
       'traitors...betraying the  motherland'.  There  had  been  riots  in
       Welikade  prison  as  a   result   of   which   27   inmates   died.
       Disappearances and arbitrary detentions continued despite the end of
       the civil war; the same unspecified  'civil  society  organisations'
       had recorded one disappearance, on average, every five days.  Tamils
       in Anuradhapura camp were detained for long periods  (two  to  three
       years in some cases) but very few were charged with any offence.  In
       2009, the Senior Superintendent of Police, CN  Wakishta,  apologised
       publicly  for  the  delays  and  asked  detainees  to  regard  their
       detention as a public service, in the interests of breaking the LTTE
       network.  Under the PTA, individuals could be  held  for  up  to  18
       months  without  judicial  supervision,  and  moved  without  notice
       internally.  This increased  the  risk  of  abuse.  The  Sri  Lankan
       constitution did not provide for independent medical examination  in
       prison.  Both the  now-lapsed  Emergency  Regulations  and  the  PTA
       contained impunity provisions; individuals who had been abused  were
       therefore reluctant to come forward.

   19. The Sri Lankan judiciary had been under pressure for  decades,  even
       before the attempt to impeach the Chief Justice by  a  Parliamentary
       Select Committee, which had  subsequently  been  held  to  be  ultra
       vires.  The Chief Justice was removed from her post.

   20. Tamil nationalism was alive and well:  Tamils still hungered  for  a
       homeland.  Corruption in Sri Lanka was endemic:

          "79. Corruption continues to be widespread  and  the  U.S.  State
          Department (USSD), Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights  Practices
          2009, Sri Lanka, issued on 25 February 2010 observed that:

             "The law provides criminal penalties for official  corruption;
             however, the government did not implement the law effectively,
             and  officials  in  all  three  branches  of  the   government
             frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.

          80. It would not be incorrect to say that almost every service in
          Sri Lanka can be purchased for a price. ...

          83. Nepotism and clientelism is rife in Sri Lanka  and  political
          office has  traditionally  been  used  to  perpetuate  power  and
          accumulate wealth. ... Mahinda Rajapaksa's election as  President
          in 2005 broke the stranglehold of power by a small, higher  class
          clan of political elite. Since then, the government is  dominated
          by the President's family with two of his  brothers  holding  key
          executive branch posts  as  Defense  Secretary  and  minister  of
          economic development ,  while  a  third  brother  serves  as  the
          Speaker  of  Parliament.  A  large  number  of  other  relatives,
          including the president's son, also serve in important  political
          or diplomatic positions. The culture of nepotism goes beyond  the
          echelons of political  power  and  is  noticeable  in  the  civil
          services,  judiciary,  police  and  other  divisions   of   state
          administration."

   21.  Sri  Lanka  was  79th  of  the  176   countries   in   Transparency
       International's corruption index.

   22. Of the 120 victims, family members and witnesses  of  torture,  whom
       she interviewed between November 2011 and December 2012, the witness
       drew the following conclusions:

          i) 73 of them had a direct or indirect LTTE association, and 30 of
             those  were  members  of  the  LTTE.   The  rest  were   wives,
             girlfriends, brothers and sisters and children of LTTE cadres;

         ii) All were aged between  16  and  50,  and  most  were  from  the
             Northern and Eastern Provinces;

        iii) The victims had been tortured over the period 2006-2012.   Only
             31 had  been  detained  and  tortured  after  the  end  of  the
             conflict; 12 in 2010, 11 in 2011, and 8 in 2012;

         iv) 26 of the victims were picked up and detained in Colombo;

          v) The group  of  those  tortured  (including  sexual  abuse)  for
             suspected links to the LTTE included a Sinhalese man and  three
             Muslims, and a member of Frontline Socialist Party;

         vi) The government's purpose was to prevent the resurgence  of  the
             LTTE and the revival of conflict  within  Sri  Lanka.   In  the
             Indian Defence Review on   26  April,  2010,  Defence  Minister
             Gotabaya Rajapaksa was quoted as saying:

                "We cannot allow LTTE terror to come back. The  first  phase
                of the civil war is over.  The  LTTE's  war  machinery,  its
                fighting ability and  its  leadership  in  Vanni  have  been
                decimated and destroyed. The second phase of the  civil  war
                will be  in  a  different  form.  So  we  can't  relax.  Our
                operational preparedness must be high,  but  invisible.  Our
                security strategy has to be in a different form.

                We have to develop superior intelligence gathering abilities
                and mechanisms. We have to develop military intelligence. We
                have  to   develop   a   national   intelligence   gathering
                infrastructure. ... We now know how much weaponry, artillery
                pieces  were  brought  in  from  the  sea  by  LTTE   ships.
                Therefore, maritime surveillance is of utmost importance  to
                prevent any new group that takes the mantle of LTTE to bring
                weapons to the country."

        vii) The GOSL had  expanded  its  military  force  in  the  Northern
             Province.  In an interview with The Sunday Leader in May  2012,
             the Defence Secretary said:

                "There is no need now for search and  cordon  operations  or
                having many road blocks, checkpoints or rounding  up  people
                for questioning. That is no longer necessary. But there  are
                other  methods  to  keep   vigilant.   Especially   on   the
                intelligence side - we have increased military  intelligence
                units. We are  training  them  more  and  more  in  advanced
                methods so they can gather information on these affairs  and
                have an early warning. Then we keep an eye on certain people
                that we know have been engaged in criminal activity. Certain
                people who have been rehabilitated and released - some  have
                adjusted very well and integrated extremely well... some are
                working happily in various jobs, some are engaged  in  their
                own work. But there are a  few  people  not  terrorists  but
                engaged in normal criminal activity. There is a  possibility
                these people may get involved in terrorist activity again".

       viii) Tamils travelling internally were required to register with the
             police and in the  Northern  and  Eastern  Provinces  would  be
             interviewed about their relatives outside the country.  No such
             requirement was applied to Sinhalese internal migrants. Births,
             deaths, and details of guests received by Tamil households  had
             to be disclosed and permission sought. Weddings,  funerals  and
             other private functions had  to  be  notified  and  photographs
             might be taken of the guests.

         ix) Paramilitary groups were engaging in abductions for ransom  and
             extortion, in the Northern Province and in Colombo.  There  had
             been 32 abductions between  October  2011  and  February  2012.
             Amongst the abductions  for  gain  were  a  smaller  number  of
             abductions for political reasons; it was  difficult  to  assess
             the  proportion.   Those  individuals  were   passed   to   the
             authorities and were detained and tortured.

          x) Those in rehabilitation camps were in detention and  should  be
             so  considered.   Even  after  release,   they   were   closely
             monitored, visited regularly in their homes,  and could be  re-
             detained if there were perceived concerns about their behaviour
             and activities;

         xi) Persons returning to the  Northern  Province  without  identity
             cards or passports were at particular risk of  questioning  and
             detention. Obtaining a  new  identity  card  required  an  'all
             clear' from local police which according to an  unnamed  'civil
             society' source in Vavuniya was difficult to obtain,  even  for
             Tamils with no history;

        xii) A person returned without an identity card might  well  attract
             adverse interest as a person who had not been screened or  been
             through the rehabilitation process;

       xiii)  Various  paramilitary  groups  had   staked   out   individual
             territories in Vavuniya and were considered to  be  responsible
             in  their  areas  for  most  of   the   killings,   abductions,
             extortions, assaults and threats.  The EPDP was  considered  to
             be working closely with the GOSL, particularly in the  Northern
             Province.  Paramilitary groups had no role in peacetime and  an
             economic motive for remaining involved in combat activities;

        xiv)  Those  now  being  detained  and  tortured   included   former
             administrators for the LTTE, and forcible conscripts.

         xv) Those who had  been  rehabilitated  remained  of  interest  and
             subject to harassment and monitoring after their release;

        xvi) Half of those whom she had interviewed had returned voluntarily
             from  the  United  Kingdom  and  been  detained  and  tortured.
             Interest was high, particularly because of the United Kingdom's
             traditional role in fundraising for the LTTE. The GOSL was also
             concerned about the current  role  of  the  diaspora,  and  was
             seeking "to acquire intelligence  on  the  activities  of  this
             politically active diaspora, particularly on  its  contribution
             to international moves towards  an  inquiry  into  alleged  war
             crimes committed by the state in its 2009 defeat of  the  LTTE"
             as well  as  "to  send  a  signal  to  the  diaspora  that  any
             involvement in an  international  campaign  against  Sri  Lanka
             would result in harsh consequences".

       xvii) However, she was unaware of any hard evidence of  genuine  LTTE
             activity  in  Sri  Lanka,  nor  any  independent  evidence   of
             resurgence in the diaspora. Her interviews with experts led  to
             the conclusion that "... while fund raising for the Tamil cause
             in the diaspora continues to remain active and there remains  a
             residual nostalgia for the LTTE within Sri Lanka, chances of  a
             revival of the LTTE remain dim".

      xviii) The use of torture 'continues rampantly' despite the end of the
             civil war, with no real change in the patterns of torture or in
             the use of Sinhalese speakers to inflict harm  on  Tamils.  She
             did not suggest any change in the list of methods  reported  by
             the then Special Rapporteur, Manfred Nowak, after  a  visit  in
             2007:

                "Methods reported included  beating  with  various  weapons,
                beating on the soles of the feet (falaqa), blows to the ears
                ("telephono"), positional abuse when  handcuffed  or  bound,
                suspension  in  various  positions,   including   strappado,
                "butchery", "reversed butchery", and  "parrot's  perch"  (or
                dharma chakara), burning with metal objects and  cigarettes,
                asphyxiation  with  plastic  bags  with  chilli  pepper   or
                gasoline, and various forms of genital torture.  This  array
                of torture  finds  its  fullest  manifestation  at  the  TID
                detention facility in Boosa..."

        xix) There had been no recent large-scale searches  in  Colombo  and
             there were far fewer checkpoints there now.  Tamils  still  had
             difficulty in finding work and accommodation  in  Colombo;  for
             migrants, Tamil community support was required even in  densely
             populated Tamil areas.  The migrant Tamil population was  in  a
             different position from the  integrated  Tamils  who  had  been
             there much longer  and  spoke  Sinhalese.   26  of  the  former
             detainees had been picked up in Colombo,  mostly  because  they
             had direct or indirect associations with the LTTE.

   23. In her second statement, Ms Hogg said that the GOSL considered  that
       Tamil Nadu was a centre of LTTE activity, and also, that there was a
       large LTTE network in Australia.  Other countries  with  LTTE  front
       organisations included: France, Germany,  Norway,  Sweden,  Belgium,
       Switzerland, South Africa, New Zealand and Canada.  The  Sri  Lankan
       Defence  Ministry  website  carried  an  article   identifying   the
       following as key  LTTE  front  organisations  in  various  countries
       across the world:

              . Tamil  Rehabilitation  Organization  /  International  Tamil
                Rehabilitation Organization),
              . White Pigeon,
              . British Tamil Association (BTA),
              . World Tamil Movement (WTM),
              . Tamil Coordinating
              . Committee (TCC),
              . British Tamil Forum (BTF),
              . Tamil Youth Organization (TYO)  (branches  in  12  countries
                including the United Kingdom)
              . Coordinating Committee of Tamils-France (CCTF).
              . Tamil Coordinating  Committee  (TCC)  (in  Germany,  Norway,
                Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, South Africa, Belgium &  New
                Zealand)
              . World Tamil Movement (WTM) (Canada); and
              . World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC) (Switzerland).

   24. 20,000 children were in Tamil-run schools which were not  supervised
       by the relevant educational systems and  were  used  for  propaganda
       purposes.  There were concerns about the curriculum and  whether  it
       was being used to train a further generation of insurgents.

   25. Only the United Kingdom currently sends charter  flights  of  failed
       asylum seekers to Sri Lanka.   There  was  some  protection  at  the
       airport but British High Commission officials did not monitor  post-
       airport returns and the security forces would  attempt  to  pick  up
       those in whom they were interested from the  onward  address  within
       Sri Lanka.

   26. The rehabilitation process was  accurately  described  in  the  2012
       Country of Origin Report  by  the  UKBA.  Rehabilitees  were  to  be
       detained for a maximum of two years, although  there  were  multiple
       cases where individuals  had  been  detained  for  longer.   It  was
       impossible to gauge how many had been rearrested and why, due to the
       lack of transparent information.

   27. The Sri Lankan government was aware that some of those returned were
       economic migrants.

   28. In her third report, published after the 28 February 2013 flight and
       thus without the constraint imposed on her by Human Rights Watch  in
       the earlier  reports,  Ms  Hogg  clarified  that  24  of  those  she
       interviewed had been picked up in Colombo. 'Most' of those  detained
       were forced to sign a confession in the Sinhala language after being
       repeatedly  questioned  and  told   about   their   perceived   LTTE
       connections.  All but  three  of  those  she  interviewed  had  been
       released after bribes were paid via agents belonging to  the  Karuna
       faction, the EPDP, or the Muslim  community.   She  considered  that
       'escaped' and 'released' were used interchangeably to  describe  how
       individuals then left custody.

   29.  Her  interviews  were  conducted  through  a  trusted   interpreter
       appointed by Human Rights Watch; she had no spreadsheets  containing
       the underlying data; she had not asked whether individuals left  Sri
       Lanka on their own passports; one or two had told her that was  what
       happened, but other said they had used human smugglers.

   30. Human Rights Watch had decided that the redaction  of  facts  should
       include the names of doctors who prepared the  medico-legal  reports
       on the  individuals  Ms  Hogg  interviewed.   That  had  been  their
       decision,  not  hers.   She   had   seen   evidence   from   medical
       practitioners, hospitals and solicitors, and in most  cases,  asylum
       interviews,  records,  and  determinations  in  order  to  draw  her
       conclusions.

       Oral evidence

   31. In her oral evidence on 6 February 2013, Ms Hogg adopted  her  first
       two reports and was tendered for  cross-examination.   She  told  us
       that she had not personally been  to  Sri  Lanka  since  2008.   The
       majority of those she interviewed had been based in Sri  Lanka,  but
       of the victims, the majority were not in Sri Lanka.  She was not  at
       liberty to say where the victims were. Only five  victims,  and  two
       deportees were still in Sri Lanka. Thirty-three of the witnesses had
       accounts relating to the post-war period, and  fewer  than  five  of
       them were in Sri Lanka.  She was unable to say where the 13  victims
       were who featured in the Human Rights Watch reports in the  May  and
       September 2012.  There  had  been  three  which  related  to  United
       Kingdom returns, two directly from the United Kingdom and one via  a
       third country.

   32. She could  not  say  what  the  breakdown  was  between  Tamils  and
       Sinhalese in the provincial and district  elections  in  Sri  Lanka.
       Some of the district representatives  elected  were  Tamil  but  the
       information was not readily available either by GOSL  disclosure  or
       on the internet.

   33. Asked whether most of the  million-strong  Tamil  diaspora  remained
       committed to a separate Tamil state and  were  prepared  to  support
       violence; she stated that that the issue of Tamil  rights  was  kept
       alive in the  diaspora,  which  was  concerned  about  the  lack  of
       accountability for the events of 2009, and continuing  impunity.   A
       resolution had been tabled at the UN Human Rights Committee in 2012.
        The UN's March 2012 resolution acted as a rallying  point  for  the
       diaspora, since the  internal  mechanisms  in  Sri  Lanka  were  not
       addressing the problems.

   34. Asked again about the support for renewed  violence,  Ms  Hogg  said
       that there was nostalgia for the LTTE and it was fair  to  say  that
       there was a general feeling of discontent.  She  had  not  seen  the
       post-LLRC National Action Plan.  She had been told that none of  the
       recommendations had been implemented.   She  could  not  reveal  her
       sources among 'civil society' and economic think tanks in Sri Lanka.



   35. In the Northern Province,  her  understanding  was  that  there  was
       active reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, but only by and for
       the  benefit  of  the  Sri  Lankan  military   occupation:    banks,
       restaurants, vegetable shops  and  so  on  were  being  reopened  in
       military hands.  Tamils had not participated in the economic growth;
       they were reduced to the status of witnesses of  the  reconstruction
       of the Northern Province.

   36. It was impossible to know how many people had  been  detained  under
       the PTA.

   37. In relation to the Jaffna Tamil students who had been arrested while
       celebrating Martyrs' Day, she did not know  whether  they  had  been
       mistreated in detention.  She was aware that some  people  had  been
       through the rehabilitation process but did not have any idea of  the
       numbers.  Her information  was  confined  to  the  circumstances  of
       individuals  who  had   been   through   rehabilitation   and   were
       subsequently arrested and ill-treated.  She had no evidence  tending
       to show that torture  occurred  during  rehabilitation,  though  she
       questioned its legality as a process. Her  evidence  was  that  some
       people were picked up again after rehabilitation, and some of  those
       individuals were tortured.

   38. When using the phrase 'security forces', Ms Hogg said she meant  the
       army, military intelligence, the police and the TID.   She  did  not
       mean the SIS and she did not know what the abbreviation meant.   Her
       understanding was that both the military and the police  force  were
       involved in national security, with  military  intelligence  police.
       She  was  not  aware  of  a  specific  unit  dealing  with  overseas
       intelligence gathering, but overseas posts had military attach�s.

   39. In the majority of cases of which she was aware, family members were
       not informed of the reason for arrests, or where  individuals  would
       be detained.  They usually made enquiries within the community, from
       military  outposts   and   local   police   stations,   not   always
       successfully.  She based  this  on  a  piece  of  research  she  had
       conducted for Human Rights Watch  in  2008,  before  the  civil  war
       ended.  A similar pattern had emerged in her 2011-2012 research. Her
       firm evidence was that the family was never told where  people  were
       being held.  Whether detention was for the purpose  of  intelligence
       gathering was never clear.

   40. Intelligence gathering since the civil  war  had  been  impressively
       effective, as some former high ranking LTTE members  had  cooperated
       with the authorities.  The authorities had good  intelligence  about
       LTTE cadres and supporters, both domestically and abroad.

   41. Ms Hogg was asked why the authorities would interrogate and  torture
       low-ranking LTTE members now.  She stated that that it was difficult
       to read the mindset of the GOSL and that was not her expertise.  She
       agreed that the GOSL needed to ensure the  defeat  of  the  LTTE  in
       order for the present r�gime to continue  in  power,  and  she  also
       accepted that having  regard  to  the  huge  increases  in  military
       spending, the GOSL needed to justify its actions by showing that the
       LTTE remained a threat.  The  authorities  when  they  picked  up  a
       person, for example on the streets of Colombo, would  be  seeking  a
       confession confirming what they already knew about that individual's
       involvement with  the  LTTE.   They  were  also  interested  in  the
       involvement of brothers  and  sisters,  spouses,  and  other  family
       members, or their current location if that was not known.

   42. Some of those she interviewed had been picked up at  home,  some  at
       work, and some outside IDP camps  used  as  rehabilitation  centres.
       They were all questioned about the LTTE.

   43. She had personally conducted 69  interviews  and  had  received  six
       reports from medical experts, relating to individuals who could  not
       be interviewed due to their medical state.   She  had  analysed  the
       pickup and detention sites, which security force was  involved,  the
       manner of torture and the sexual violence if any.  Some  individuals
       had been picked up by the military or the CID.  In  others,  it  was
       unclear, since the individuals had been  picked  up  by  persons  in
       plain clothes.  She had also asked about the kinds of statement they
       had been asked to sign following questioning.

   44. Ms Hogg said that there was a report due to be published.   She  was
       not willing to name the organisation which was going to publish  it,
       but it was for that organisation that her research had been  carried
       out, as a consultant.  She was prepared to  state  that  it  was  an
       international organisation, and that in a few weeks the report would
       be in the public domain.  She had agreed to  give  evidence  on  the
       basis that the information she  had  gathered  was  useful  for  the
       purposes of  informing  the  court.  She  was  not  going  to  share
       unpublished information with the Tribunal.

   45. She then stated that in all the cases there was supporting  evidence
       of torture, in the form of medico legal reports. She had interviewed
       people either in person or over Skype.

   46. The Sri Lankan government was  insecure  and  paranoid  in  security
       terms.  It mattered not whether the LTTE operatives were  low-level.
       She could not say why the government was re-arresting  rehabilitated
       cadres; there was evidence that it was happening. There was a  large
       body of evidence that the Sri Lankan security  forces  used  torture
       routinely. The psychiatric wellbeing of Sri Lankan  Tamils  was  not
       the first consideration in the mind of the Sri Lankan  state.  There
       was a huge and intrusive military presence in an area which the GOSL
       considered to be at peace. Even those with a remote association  had
       been targeted for questioning and tortured, for  example  those  who
       worked in its cultural or education wing, although it had ceased  to
       exist in 2009.  Some of those picked up in 2010-11 had  participated
       in activities way back in 2001-2.  this evidence was not set out  in
       her report but was implicit and would be in  the  public  domain  in
       another two or three weeks, on or about 28 February 2013.

   47. We adjourned Ms Hogg's evidence to  await  the  publication  of  the
       report. She was recalled on 15 March 2013  and  adopted  her  second
       supplementary statement. Mr Hall  continued  his  cross-examination.
       Ms Hogg stated that all 24 of the individuals now relied  upon  were
       drawn from her research for Human Rights Watch,  although  some  had
       refused permission to identify where they were  held  when  detained
       and tortured.  She had not identified  whether  they  were  detained
       either before or after the end of the civil war in relation  to  the
       locations where they were detained.

   48. Asked about her experience of interviewing victims  of  torture,  Ms
       Hogg said that she had interviewed victims from other  countries  as
       well as Sri Lanka.  All victims understood that when signing a paper
       written in a language which  they  did  not  understand,  it  was  a
       confession.  She had seen confession documents in Sri Lanka  in  the
       past but not one signed specifically in connection with the cases in
       this report.  They were always in the Sinhala  language,  which  she
       did not speak.  When she had interviewed victims of torture  in  the
       past, as a journalist and a human rights  researcher,  she  arranged
       for  translation  of  the  documents  by  a  reliable   interpreter.
       Language had been a way in which Tamils  were  persecuted  and  kept
       outside the processes in Sri Lanka.  The language issue was  one  of
       the contributory factors to the conflict, and the language in  court
       and police stations  was  always  Sinhala.  It  contributed  to  the
       feeling of alienation within the  Tamil  population;  the  Sinhalese
       government used it as a means of controlling the  Tamil  population.
       Numerous reconciliation commissions had called for Tamil to be  used
       in police documents and  police  stations  but  it  had  never  been
       implemented.  Tamil was not used as the language of official work in
       Sri Lanka and it would be very surprising  to  find  a  'confession'
       document written and signed in the Tamil language.

   49. There was a lack of due process  in  Sri  Lanka;  the  interrogating
       officer was not required to inform individuals  or  the  reason  for
       their arrest, issue an arrest warrant, or inform  legal  counsel  of
       the arrest. That was just the way it worked.

   50. The process of bribing officials to obtain a  person's  release  was
       complex; once family members noticed an individual was missing, they
       would have to make enquiries where he was last seen,  and  at  local
       police stations, and offer a bribe.  That might get the  information
       as to where the person might be, and the family would then  have  to
       pursue its own investigation within the community, with  Sri  Lankan
       officials known to be corrupt, MPs and powerful interlocutors.  Just
       getting the basic information was very elaborate.  Officials in  the
       CID and members of armed groups with political authority and 'clout'
       would also be asked; other sources included persons said to be close
       to the political establishment, corrupt journos with access  to  the
       security forces and the police.

   51. Sometimes, a family might have to bribe ten or fifteen people to get
       access to those holding the detainee; a local police  station  might
       not always require a bribe. She did not say that happened  in  every
       case.  The procedure was open only to those  who  could  afford  the
       bribes; there was a large category of individuals for  whom  payment
       was not an option.  Some might be able to afford to secure  release,
       but not exit from Sri  Lanka.   She  could  not  say  how  much  was
       required to obtain a false passport and leave Sri Lanka irregularly.

   52. The interpreters were always present when evidence was given  either
       by Skype or in person; she  selected  interpreters  from  her  Human
       Rights Watch contacts and the interpreter would be  in  a  different
       place from Ms Hogg and the interviewee.  Among the  small  group  of
       victims interviewed outside the United Kingdom, in two  cases  there
       were  medical  reports  (not  necessarily  medico   legal   reports)
       corroborating their account of  torture.   She  had  included  those
       reports in her reference to  MLRs.   It  was  Human  Rights  Watch's
       decision that the  names  of  the  doctors  preparing  medico  legal
       reports should not be disclosed.  Nothing which might give away  the
       present location of the  individuals  was  to  be  disclosed  unless
       specifically cleared with the  victim.   The  sexual  violence  also
       included evidence from solicitors, but in no case was that the  only
       evidence; it was just part of the package.

   53. In re-examination, Ms Hogg was asked again  about  the  language  of
       'confession' documents, and the purpose of creating such  documents.
       She considered that if legal proceedings were brought in  future  or
       the authorities sought to re-arrest an individual based on  evidence
       of previous involvement, the 'confessions' would be used  for  that.
       Her own view was that it could be part of  a  strategy  by  the  Sri
       Lankan authorities to  show  that  all  detained  Tamils  were  LTTE
       cadres.

   54. Confessions under the PTA were not admissible in court but she could
       not recall whether that was in her report.




















                                 APPENDIX G

                           TAMILS AGAINST GENOCIDE



   Ms Jan Jananayagam


1. Miss Jananayagam describes herself as Director of, and spokesperson  for,
   Tamils against Genocide (TAG).  Her background is in financial technology
   and business; she works as  a  fixed  income  and  commodity  derivatives
   trader. She has a BSc in  Computing  and  Information  Systems  from  the
   University of  Manchester  and  two  Masters'  degrees,  one  in  Applied
   Mathematics from Imperial College London, and one  from  INSEAD  Business
   School in Business Administration.

2. For the last decade, she has been involved with  a  number  of  pro  bono
   Tamil community projects, the most recent of which is TAG, for which  she
   has been a volunteer manager and global spokesman since  2009,  when  the
   civil war ended in Sri Lanka.  She was a columnist on the United Kingdom-
   based Tamil Guardian newspaper from 2006-2009.  Also in 2009,  she  stood
   as an independent candidate in the European  elections  (for  the  London
   region) and won 50,000 votes, among the highest number of votes polled by
   an independent candidate in any European election.

3. Last year, Ms Jananayagam took a one-year sabbatical from her  employment
   and  set  up  TAG  Europe.   Both  TAG  and  TAG  Europe  are  pro   bono
   organisations, funded by donations and do not charge for their output  or
   services.  TAG Europe was responsible for a report entitled 'Returnees at
   risk: detention and torture in Sri Lanka' published  16  September  2012.
   TAG organises and finances litigation; 50% of  its  work  is  litigation-
   related,  including  submissions  on  war  crimes  to  the  International
   Criminal Court (ICC). She relied on the UNHCR guidelines in December 2012
   as indicating that 'certain witnesses and victims of war  crimes  seeking
   justice' were a risk category in Sri Lanka now.

4. Her witness statement was based upon  the  "Returnees  at  Risk"  report,
   with the  intention  of  updating  it.   The  report  had  been  prepared
   independently of Human Rights Watch and FFT, with no research  or  drafts
   being  shared  between  the  three  groups.   Any  similarities  in   the
   conclusions were coincidental.  There was a limited overlap  between  the
   cases considered.

5. The "Returnees at Risk" report  was  based  on  United  Kingdom  judicial
   determinations on Sri Lanka returnees and had been prepared by  a  multi-
   disciplinary team selected by her.  It was the only such report  anywhere
   in the world, to her knowledge.  The data set was sourced and  identified
   through a small number of intermediate professionals who had professional
   contacts with  suitable  asylum  seekers  and  were  willing  to  act  as
   intermediaries.  In the third data set, she had direct contact  with  the
   external researcher. The request was for 'data relating to  asylum  cases
   of persons alleging persecution on return to Sri Lanka from abroad'.

6. TAG found that  other  non-governmental  organisations,  including  Human
   Rights Watch, had contacted their intermediate professionals ahead of the
   TAG researcher, seeking in particular failed  asylum  seeker  cases;  the
   cases passed to TAG tended to be those which had not been passed to other
   NGOs, in this case, those with no previous failed asylum claim.

7. Two determinations dealing with  non-returnees  had  been  excluded  from
   consideration. A total of 27 determinations were relied  upon,  with  one
   unsuccessful appeal included.   The  request  had  not  been  limited  to
   successful appeals, but all 27 of those  received  had  medical  reports.
   More determinations had  come  in  subsequently  -  another  eight.   The
   approach to be taken was decided upon after 'initial eyeballing'  of  the
   data set in September 2012, which threw up some apparent  patterns:   low
   level or tenuous LTTE affiliations; questions about a  broad  variety  of
   United Kingdom diaspora activities; being asked to identify other  United
   Kingdom residents from photographs.  The abuse peaked in the three months
   following the release of the first of the "Sri  Lanka's  Killing  Fields"
   documentary by Channel 4, in June 2011.

8. The team was conscious of the small size of the sample and  of  the  lack
   of balance between successful and  unsuccessful  appeals.   TAG  did  not
   claim that this was a representative sample.  There were very few  failed
   asylum seekers in the data set; however, if voluntary returnees  were  at
   risk, they deduced that failed asylum seekers would be at higher risk. Ms
   Jananayagam did not find it strange that the sample group did not contain
   other categories of  Sri  Lankan  returnees  from  London  (tourists  and
   business people).  Students were active participants in political protest
   and were of correspondingly greater interest.

9. The information in the determinations was that ten of the  26  successful
   claimants had been questioned about political activities,  protests,  and
   affiliations while in the United Kingdom.  Newer determinations indicated
   that the airport authorities had video or photographic evidence and  were
   using computer  software  to  identify  those  who  had  participated  in
   protests.  The information as to what was the reason  for  interrogation,
   in the determinations, was often unclear or missing,  presumably  because
   of the way in which the appeals were argued.

10. Since the report, there  had  been  the  incident  with  restriction  of
   political protests at Jaffna University; and surveillance and  harassment
   in Australia by the Sri Lankan state of  Sri  Lankans  protesting  during
   Australian cricket.  Boat  persons  from  Australia  when  returned  were
   arrested, interrogated, detained and charged with 'illegally leaving  the
   country'.   Failed  asylum  seekers  were  detained  for  long   periods,
   sometimes months, with perfunctory fortnightly judicial overview.

11. In Sri  Lanka,  'the  line  between  lawful  arrest  and  detention  and
   unlawful abduction and incommunicado detention is blurred' and there  was
   no effective judicial remedy.  TAG had little  access  within  Sri  Lanka
   because of the risk to  Tamils  involved  with  NGOs  there.  Many  other
   diaspora groups within Sri Lanka limited their intervention  to  aid  and
   development work for that reason.  The pressure on the media  was  heavy,
   and media attention within Sri Lanka unlikely to increase the  chance  of
   release. The GOSL  used  local  media  to  put  across  its  position  on
   returnees and failed asylum seekers.

12. For these reasons, TAG relied on data gathered from  those  outside  Sri
   Lanka who no longer needed to fear the authorities there.

13. She dealt with the dispute between the respondent and TAG in the  autumn
   of 2012.  On 18 September 2012, TAG disclosed all of  the  determinations
   received (including the two which were not related to returnees)  to  the
   UKBA.  The respondent published her Sri Lanka Policy Bulletin  1/2012  on
   or around 17 October 2012, ahead of  a  charter  flight  planned  for  23
   October 2012.  TAG became aware of it on the day of the  charter  flight.
   The report was highly critical  of  TAG's  "Returnees  at  Risk"  report,
   including assertions that the TAG data was  incorrect  'as  their  claims
   were not based on any return incident', 'almost half  the  asylum  claims
   were not accepted', and  'of  the  13  determinations  submitted  to  the
   Agency, three of the claimants did not base their asylum  claim  on  mis-
   treatment after a return to Sri Lanka  from  the  United  Kingdom  and  a
   thirds case was a voluntary return from Switzerland, whose  alleged  ill-
   treatment occurred 5 months after return'.

14. TAG protested and the Bulletin was amended the next day, with the  first
   and third comments deleted altogether, and the comment about almost  half
   of the asylum claims not being accepted amended to 'the status of  almost
   half of the asylum claims is unclear'.  TAG  was  concerned  that  in  at
   least two subsequent cases, the Treasury Solicitor had relied on the  un-
   amended version.

   Oral evidence

15. Ms  Jananayagam  adopted  her  witness  statement  and  was  asked  some
   supplementary questions by Ms Jegarajah, before being tendered for cross-
   examination.  She was asked her current understanding of  the  number  of
   civilian deaths in the final conflict:  she replied that over  time,  the
   figures had changed.  Initially, the numbers were  thought  to  be  about
   7,000.  In May 2010, the International Crisis Group  (ICG)  had  assessed
   the figure as 30,000; the United  Nations  Expert  Panel  considered  the
   range was between 40,000 and 70,000 and had settled  on  40,000.   Bishop
   Joseph of Mannar had said that, having regard to  the  population  before
   the civil war, there were over 146000 missing people.   The  World  Bank,
   based on population subtraction, had come up with a figure of 100,000.

16. On any view, the figures were huge, and significantly in excess  of  the
   deaths at Srebrenica in the Kosovo conflict,  when  the  ICTY  considered
   that 8000 had been executed.  Genocide was not a question of numbers  but
   of intention; the international  organisations  had  not  used  the  word
   'genocide', hoping  that  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  would  agree  to
   investigate it internally.  It  was  difficult  to  pin  down  the  exact
   responsibility any further.

17. She acknowledged that her name appeared on  a  published  list  of  LTTE
   "agents" in the diaspora  but  did  not  know  who  was  responsible  for
   compiling that list.  She considered it indicative of the GOSL's mindset.
    Her candidacy in the European elections was  an  attempt  to  raise  the
   profile of the genocide and to push for an  international  investigation.
   The Sri Lankan government had always  chosen  to  confuse  the  LTTE  and
   Tamils generally, to avoid any suggestion that a two-state  solution  was
   appropriate.  The suggestion of an armed threat was useful to it. It  was
   very difficult to find political space for Tamils; a little easier  since
   the defeat of the LTTE, but the government wanted to  close  that  space.
   Since the Amendment 18 to the Constitution of Sri  Lanka,  the  two-state
   solution was unconstitutional and therefore  unlawful,  as  well  as  not
   being feasible in practical terms.

18. The witnesses with whom TAG dealt tended not to  wish  to  disclose  any
   witnessing of war crimes, and if such  knowledge  were  revealed  to  TAG
   during their interviews, they asked TAG not to disclose it further.  They
   still had family members in Sri Lanka who would be put at risk,  so  they
   were really hesitant.  Her opinion was that the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
   knew which witnesses had evidence that could implicate them.

19. In answer to questions from Mr Spurling, Ms Jananayagam  said  that  the
   GOSL had made  it  clear  that  they  were  monitoring  contacts  between
   diaspora figures and those in  Sri  Lanka,  within  the  context  of  the
   proposed visit of President Rajapaksa to the United Kingdom for the  2012
   Royal Jubilee.  She knew that  local  emails  and  telephone  calls  were
   monitored.  The government spokesman had said that they  "knew  what  the
   diaspora was planning", and had intercepted emails.  In  particular,  the
   diaspora tried to find out who  was  travelling  with  the  President  on
   foreign visits, with a view to filing  a  war  crimes  complaint  against
   those whom they knew to have committed war crimes.

20. At the beginning of his cross-examination, Mr  Hall  indicated  that  he
   would not be asking questions about the genocide allegations, which  were
   a delicate bilateral matter not relevant to the present appeals.

21. Ms Jananayagam made it clear that she was not an  expert  on  the  local
   paramilitaries, save for the "white van" disappearances.   She  was  very
   prominent and did not personally ask questions or  visit  Sri  Lanka:  an
   email from her was likely to  cause  problems  for  its  recipient.   TAG
   employed consultants to make enquiries "under cover".

22. Ms Jananayagam was asked whether it was right to say that no  discussion
   of the dual state solution was possible:   the  Tamil  United  Liberation
   Front, which had taken the political route, was openly  articulating  the
   Tamil desire for that solution.  Ms Jananayagam replied  that  all  Tamil
   parties had 'Liberation' in  their  party  names.   It  appealed  to  the
   Tamils.

23. The report contained an interview with a person  who  had  come  through
   the rehabilitation camp process. 'Cadre' in this context  meant  a  card-
   carrying member of the LTTE; members in  the  local  areas  carried  LTTE
   cards and an identity card; there was a record of their membership.   She
   believed that the LTTE did keep records.  The LTTE  government  had  been
   very organised.  She had heard that they used to send memorial letters to
   the relatives of dead cadres, offering benefits and  condolences,  though
   she had never seen such a letter.  In December 2011, a potential  witness
   who was a member of a hero family had spoken of such  documents  and  had
   alleged  that  the  respondent  handed  them  over  to  the  Sri   Lankan
   government. If the membership lists existed, Ms Jananayagam could not say
   whether they were held centrally, nor what happened  to  them  after  the
   civil war.  The GOSL would have spent time trying to find and reconstruct
   those lists; it did not appear that they already had access to them.

24. TAG's legal Counsel were there to advise  on  what  TK  said;  when  the
   "Returnees at Risk" report was prepared, they were not expecting it to go
   to court.  The medical advisers who collaborated were very opposed to any
   political initiative which might create  hostility;  they  would  not  be
   associated with any kind of controversy.  Student groups, in  Jaffna  and
   in the United Kingdom,  had  protested  the  impeachment  and  subsequent
   removal from office of the Chief Justice, as had other groups  worldwide.
   It was unusual to get worldwide support for Tamil protests and  showed  a
   real shift.

25. In re-examination, Ms Jananayagam said that  she  had  seen  mention  of
   LTTE membership cards, but not outside Sri Lanka.  In any event, the test
   should be one of sympathy, not membership.  For example,  the  person  in
   these proceedings who had worked for the Bank of Tamil Eelam  was  likely
   to be asked how much money the LTTE had in the Bank, with  or  without  a
   membership card.  TAG classified  some  people  as  civilian  supporters;
   those persons were given three months' basic training and  had  to  carry
   out some compulsory military service, often with the traffic police.  The
   LTTE had been the  de  facto  government  in  the  Northern  and  Eastern
   Provinces; there were plenty of civilian jobs for which a membership card
   was not required.  There were judges, civil servants and  a  whole  state
   infrastructure while the LTTE was in control of those areas.

Mr Alan Keenan

26. TAG also put forward what purported to be an email from Mr  Alan  Keenan
   of International Crisis Group.  It is not in the usual form for a witness
   statement, nor is it signed.  This is what it says:

        "Email Correspondence 1 Feb 2013

        Thanks for your interest in the question of the threats to  witness
        with knowledge of war crimes committed in the final months  of  Sri
        Lanka's war. I can verify that in my work  with  the  International
        Crisis Group, I have come across at least one witness  (Witness  X)
        living in hiding outside of Sri Lanka who was approached by a group
        of Sri Lankan Tamils posing as journalists attached  to  Channel  4
        television in Britain, which, as you know, had earlier  produced  a
        powerful and  well-publicised  documentary  entitled  "Sri  Lanka's
        Killing Fields". The Sri Lankan team claimed to be seeking evidence
        of war crimes committed by  the  Sri  Lankan  security  forces  and
        sought  to  interview  witness  X  for  a   follow-up   Channel   4
        documentary. Witness X declined but put the team in touch with  two
        other Sri Lankan Tamils s/he knew  who  were  willing  to  describe
        their experiences in the final phase of the civil  war.  Witness  X
        never saw her/his two friends again, has not been able to learn  of
        their whereabouts and fears they have been abducted and/or  killed.
        Channel 4 staff involved in making  "Sri  Lanka's  Killing  Fields"
        confirm they never approached witness X and did not work  with  any
        of those witness X described. They  also  confirm  that  they  have
        heard from credible  independent  sources  that  others  were  also
        targeted by the same scam. I am not able to  name  the  witness  or
        reveals her/his location in  order  to  protect  them  from  almost
        certain torture and death should  they  be  located  by  Sri  Lanka
        military intelligence.

        You have my permission to quote me on this case as you see fit."

 27. The email, if that is what it was, is not printed as an email.  All the
     identifying details as to time, sender and recipient and so on, are
                                  missing.
                                  APPENDIX H


                              MR CALLUM MACRAE

   1. Mr Macrae is an independent journalist  and  film  maker  with  thirty
      years' experience, with the Observer, the BBC and Channel 4.   He  was
      called to assist the Tribunal because through his production  company,
      Outsider TV, he made two films for Channel 4 dealing with the  end  of
      the civil war in Sri Lanka ("Sri Lanka's Killing  Fields"  [2011]  and
      'Sri Lanka's Killing Fields:  War  Crimes  Unpunished'  [2012]).   The
      Upper Tribunal has had the opportunity to  watch  the  two  programmes
      which remain available on Channel 4OD.  Mr Macrae  told  the  Tribunal
      that a  third  composite  programme,  with  further  material,  is  in
      preparation and is expected to be shown towards the end of 2013.

   2. In his witness statement,  Mr  Macrae  set  out  his  background,  the
      various awards which the filmmakers received, and the controversy they
      attracted.  The Sri Lankan  government  complained  unsuccessfully  to
      OFCOM which rejected charges of bias, unfairness and inaccuracy.   The
      2011 film was shown to the UNHCR 17th Session in Geneva on 3 June 2011
      at a side meeting and  includes  footage  of  discussions  with  UNHCR
      representatives before they withdrew from  the  Northern  and  Eastern
      Provinces.

   3. Mr Macrae had worked on the films  during  2011  and  2012,  including
      visiting Sri Lanka 'undercover'.  He had interviewed a wide variety of
      individuals and groups, in both formal and informal contexts, and  was
      aware of his obligation as a  journalist  to  question,  research  and
      challenge what he heard and saw.  His  opinions  in  the  report  were
      based on a careful assessment of all the evidence gathered over  those
      two years, much of which was not in the films.

   4. He set out the  history  of  the  Tamil  Tigers  and  of  armed  Tamil
      resistance.  The LTTE had become the leading Tamil militant  group  in
      1983, accepted by the Tamils in the Northern and Eastern Provinces  as
      the  only  real  and  effective  defence  against   the   Sri   Lankan
      government's repression of Tamils and 'Sinhalese nationalist  terror'.
      It  was  his  experience  that  many  Sinhala  nationalists  drew   no
      distinction between the Tigers and  Tamil  people  from  the  Northern
      Province.

   5. In 2009, at the end of  the  civil  war,  the  Sri  Lankan  government
      established a series of 'NFZs' into which Tamils gathered for  safety,
      only to be  ruthlessly  and  deliberately  shelled.   The  death  toll
      remained uncertain but was at least  40,000.   Pronouncements  by  the
      GOSL were not to be trusted and were  distrusted  by  British  foreign
      secretary David Miliband, as recently as April 2009, as  evidenced  by
      an internal cable exposed by WikiLeaks in which Miliband  was  alleged
      to have called the GOSL 'liars' and mentioned 'ongoing civilian deaths
      there due to government shelling in the conflict zone'.  The GOSL  had
      knowingly misled the international community and their assurances that
      returnees would not be mistreated, tortured or killed,  could  not  be
      taken seriously.  Nor could government statements  about  the  numbers
      detained in rehabilitation camps be regarded as reliable.

   6. The present situation was that rather than the hand of  victory  being
      held out to the defeated Tamils, the GOSL seemed to regard  Tamils  as
      likely to take up arms again at any moment.  The Bishop of Mannar,  at
      the UNHCR meeting in October 2012, had questioned  why  the  army  was
      still in Mannar when the civil war was over.  A former  UN  worker  in
      Kilinochchi, Benjamin Dix (who appeared in the films), was  quoted  as
      saying this:

           "The reality now is that the civil war with the Tigers has ended
           but the civil war with the  Tamil  community  continues  but  by
           other means.  There are still thousands of Tamil civilians  that
           are homeless, their land has been taken by the army. ...  Almost
           every village has an army checkpoint.  It  is  now  illegal  for
           groups to meet.  [The Tamils] are not allowed to have any public
           mourning of the dead or any kind of  demonstration.   ...  Under
           the  guise  of  the  redevelopment  and  reconstruction  of  the
           Northern Province what is  really  happening  is  this  kind  of
           ethnic reengineering of the communities in the North and East of
           Sri Lanka."

   7. The Sri Lankan Government's military  budget  had  been  significantly
      increased each year, with a 25% increase expected for  2013;  conflict
      zones remained militarised, with the army settling  in  for  the  long
      term; Sinhalese  families  were  being  invited  up  to  the  Northern
      Province and granted land and licences to fish; the Sinhalese military
      were receiving hundreds of pounds in bonuses for third  children;  and
      the military were running farms, shops and  hotels.   Tamils  remained
      homeless,  their  fishermen  were  marginalised  and  their   industry
      destroyed.  The Catholic Diocese of Jaffna's  Commission  for  Justice
      and Peace had spoken of a full-scale 'Buddhisization' of the  Northern
      Province.   President  Rajapaksa's  Defence  Secretary,  his   brother
      Gotobaya Rajapaksa, had  recently  told  the  BBC  that  it  was  'not
      appropriate to  view  the  Northern  Province  of  the  country  as  a
      predominantly Tamil area'.

   8. The  GOSL  had  a  confusing  approach  to  the  Lessons  Learned  and
      Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).  The Ministry  of  External  Affairs
      had announced in December 2011 that it would take legal action against
      organisations  which  criticised   the   LLRC,   but   many   of   its
      recommendations had been ignored.  In particular, the  recommendations
      that the security forces should disengage  from  civil  administration
      related activities;  that  the  GOSL  facilitate  the  Tamil  people's
      attendance at religious  ceremonies,  peaceful  events  and  meetings,
      without restriction; and that the GOSL set up a separate event on  the
      National Day 'to express solidarity and empathy with  all  victims  of
      the tragic conflict.  Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, then Chief Justice of
      Sri  Lanka  had  ruled  unconstitutional  a  law  which  would  weaken
      provisions for local autonomy in the Northern Province, describing her
      action  as  'implementing  [the  late   LTTE   founder   and   leader]
      Prabakharan's agenda in another form'.

   9. In relation to risk on return, the Sri Lankan Army Board  was  of  the
      opinion that the overseas Tamil diaspora was attempting to destabilise
      Sri Lanka and constituted "a clear and present danger" to the national
      security of Sri  Lanka.   Foreign  journalists  (including  Mr  Macrae
      himself),  British  members  of  parliament  and  international   non-
      governmental organisations had all been accused of supporting or being
      funded by the LTTE.  Mr Macrae had learned that some people  had  been
      arrested in Sri Lanka and accused of helping his company with the "Sri
      Lanka's Killing Fields" programmes, even though he had not interviewed
      them and they were not involved.  The Bishop of Mannar had written  to
      the Australian authorities to say that people deported from  Australia
      to Sri Lanka were regarded as traitors by the GOSL and the military.

  10. Mr Macrae noted the pressure put on those  who  might  have,  or  had,
      witnessed war crimes,  particularly  in  the  NFZs.  Tamil  government
      doctors who remained in the civil war zone had been detained and  held
      in custody for weeks before  they  recanted  publicly  their  evidence
      during the civil war about the scale of deaths and the withholding  of
      medical supplies by the GOSL.  Examples were given of individuals  who
      have been killed or  pressured  to  retract  their  accounts  of  what
      occurred. There was a particular risk  to  journalists;  the  founding
      editor of the Sunday Leader, Lasantha  Wickremetunge,  had  been  shot
      dead driving to work, in an assassination he expected, and  for  which
      he had prepared an editorial, to be published  in  the  event  of  his
      death.  Mr Macrae described this as an extrajudicial execution,  while
      acknowledging that in general, the GOSL showed  restraint  with  well-
      known figures.  Nevertheless, according to  the  World  Bank,  100,000
      Tamils remained unaccounted for at the end of the civil war.

Oral evidence

  11. Mr Macrae gave oral evidence.  In supplementary evidence-in-chief,  he
      stated that there had been no peace dividend:  there had  been  a  25%
      increase in the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence budget and the GOSL was
      constructing permanent barracks accommodation for the vast  number  of
      troops  stationed  in  the  Northern  Province,  often  on  culturally
      significant Tamil territory.

  12. The GOSL was seeking to change  the  ethnic  makeup  of  the  Northern
      Province and systematically undermining the Tamil economy in the guise
      of rebuilding the Northern Province, reengineering the  economy  there
      to marginalise Tamils by extraordinary measures. Payments  of  several
      hundred pounds were available to soldiers  settling  in  the  Northern
      Province who had a third child; in the meantime, thousands  of  Tamils
      remained homeless.  Bonuses were being paid to Sri  Lankan  fishermen;
      the army was running farms, businesses and  shops,  and  the  military
      were building and running hotels.  The Sri Lankan navy provided  whale
      watching trips for tourists; the air force ran helicopter trips.

  13. There was some genuine reconstruction; roads were being  rebuilt  with
      government subsidies and rehousing the Tamils was beginning,  but  the
      GOSL's investment in the Northern Province was intended to  change  it
      and prevent its being regarded as a Tamil homeland.

  14. Referring to his films, Mr Macrae said that while most of the material
      shown came from within Sri Lanka, much of it filmed during  the  final
      conflict, within the so-called 'No-Fire Zones', some of it  came  from
      all over the world.  He had not tried  to  get  into  the  Vanni  area
      himself; Channel 4 would not be allowed in there.  Channel 4 had  some
      discussions on the possibility of returning and working in Colombo  on
      the 2013 film; the team had received security advice that even  for  a
      GOSL-sponsored visit they should change their  routes  regularly,  and
      refrain from either eating in their own  hotel  or  moving  around  at
      night.

  15. His perception was that it was extremely dangerous to be a  government
      critic in Sri Lanka.  Overseas media workers had been 'kicked out' and
      almost 60 local media workers had been  killed.  Channel  4  had  been
      asked to leave during the civil war for criticising what was going  on
      in the camps and interviewing liberated hostages.  At a  gathering  of
      the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Perth, Australia, in 2012, the
      Sri Lankan President's media adviser had attacked Mr Macrae's work  on
      camera, waving his finger  and  saying  that  Mr  Macrae's  films  for
      Channel 4 were funded by the LTTE, and "absolutely part of the  global
      conspiracy to restart the civil war".

  16. The GOSL was paranoid about  its  international  reputation.   If  the
      programme had returned to Colombo, neither the media workers  involved
      with it, nor any witness, would be safe.  Mr Macrae  was  aware  of  a
      person with 'incredibly important' evidence who still would  not  come
      forward because they still had relatives in  Sri  Lanka.   There  were
      endless such examples.

  17. The GOSL in his opinion had a huge  distrust  of  the  Tamil  diaspora
      worldwide, but the diaspora  itself  was  riven  with  dissension  and
      penetrated by GOSL agents.  The  mistrust  was  well-founded  and  the
      evidence really strongly suggested that the Tamil factions were  right
      to distrust each other.

  18. Cross-examined by Mr Hall, Mr Macrae said that he had last been in Sri
      Lanka around the time of the Japanese tsunami (April  2011).   One  of
      their  objectives  then  was  to  meet  witnesses,  journalists,   and
      government agents, to get pictures and some video evidence.  They  had
      discovered a culture of fear  with  a  large  number  of  "white  van"
      disappearances.  The appearance of a white van outside the home  of  a
      government critic struck terror; people were  bundled  into  them  and
      often never seen again.  The GOSL had attacked  journalists,  lawyers,
      and was now even impeaching the former Chief Justice of Sri Lanka.

  19.  Tamils  were  by  definition  regarded  as  government  critics   and
      indistinguishable from the LTTE.  That approach, dating from the civil
      war, had allowed the massacre of Tamils during the final conflict;  it
      suited the Sri Lankan government and was still used  and  fostered  by
      GOSL.  Merely criticising the GOSL was enough  to  put  your  life  in
      danger.  140 Tamil women had been recruited into the armed forces.

  20. There were deep concerns as to what went on in the camps.  A group  of
      five or six Tamil government doctors, working in the NFZs, had bravely
      sent messages that hundreds had been killed, and  that  the  GOSL  was
      bombing hospitals.  The Red Cross as a  matter  of  standard  practice
      provided field hospital coordinates to the GOSL  to  avoid  accidental
      fire on the wounded; it had been necessary to ask them to  stop  doing
      so, as the hospitals were being targeted soon  after  the  coordinates
      had been provided.

  21. The doctors were taken into custody,  held  by  the  CID  for  several
      months, and then paraded on television, recanting what they had stated
      previously.  While detained, they had been threatened  with  long-term
      detention under the PTA (18 months without trial or charge); they were
      told that they would be tried and spend years in jail.  That  was  his
      understanding of the GOSL's  "rehabilitation"  process.   He  was  not
      aware of anyone claiming to have suffered  any  physical  harm  during
      rehabilitation. The Tamil community was aware that people  were  being
      forced to recant and it was not taken seriously.

  22. The white van disappearances appeared to be state sponsored.   In  the
      Northern Province, soldiers were involved, although the vans  did  not
      contain state operatives.  There  was  a  subculture  of  paramilitary
      former Tigers who were now working for the government, as well as pro-
      government militias.  Those who were  abducted  in  white  vans  often
      turned up in police custody in due course.   When  asked  about  their
      whereabouts, the police could not find them.  When he heard of  Tamils
      returning voluntarily, he was always surprised; he was  aware  of  one
      such person who was seized on return, taken into custody and tortured.
      Where Tamils were returned involuntarily, his  opinion  was  that  the
      GOSL would assume that they did not wish to return because  they  were
      Tiger supporters in the Northern Province during the civil war, and  a
      witness therefore to what went on.  Such people would  be  intimidated
      into silence, or worse.  The authorities assumed that  those  who  did
      not wish to return had some kind of  connection  with  the  LTTE;  the
      default assumption was that all Tamils supported the Tigers.

  23. The funding of the civil war had been unequal; the Tigers  were  self-
      funding via their international diaspora and by commercial activities.
       The GOSL was  supported  financially  by  China,  Iran,  Israel,  and
      Pakistan: it sent military commanders to India, Britain and Canada  as
      diplomats, so that it should be assumed that in those  countries,  the
      High Commissions would make Colombo aware of local activities.

  24. The Sri Lankan government was sinking ever more deeply into  a  really
      dangerous place, a paranoid culture of ultra-nationalism.  The country
      was military-run and regarded  itself  as  under  siege,  despite  the
      defeat of the Tigers.  The GOSL believed that at any moment the Tamils
      might revive the internal armed  conflict  and  considered  that  even
      economic migrants overseas were likely to be sympathetic to supporters
      of the armed struggle.  Returning economic migrants would have to deal
      with the security forces, the army and the military generally, all  of
      whom would regard  almost  every  returning  Tamil  with  the  deepest
      suspicion.

  25. The levels of discrimination now  being  imposed  were  extraordinary.
      The Tamil community overall was regarded as a  threat  needing  to  be
      marginalised, so that the civil war  could  never  happen  again,  and
      anyone with the mildest pro-Tamil opinion was  a  threat  to  the  Sri
      Lankan government.  He  was  'not  particularly  aware'  of  the  GOSL
      inviting the return of the Tamil diaspora to help rebuild the Northern
      Province.

  26. Mr Macrae was asked some questions about the LLRC but he had not  read
      it in detail, or not recently.  His understanding was  that  the  LLRC
      had  recommended  that  Tamil  rights  be  guaranteed,  that  they  be
      permitted to celebrate  their  religion  and  culture,  that  they  be
      granted additional religious freedoms, that the  military  be  removed
      from civil administration, and that there was deep  concern  expressed
      about the cavalier treatment of Tamils by the GOSL and  the  level  of
      disappearances.  Had the LLRC been  properly  implemented,  it  should
      have led to significant improvements in the treatment of  Tamils.   He
      was sure some of the recommendations were being  implemented;  it  was
      not a matter he was giving much time to since  he  was  still  in  the
      process of making his next film.

  27. Mr Macrae was asked  about  the  arrests  of  students  in  Jaffna  in
      November 2012:  his understanding was that they were  celebrating  the
      dead on 27 November 2012 during Martyrs' Day, an LTTE  cultural  event
      of high significance.  There had been very few  public  demonstrations
      by Tamils since the end of  the  civil  war  and  this  one  had  been
      organised in the light of the LLRC recommendation that  Tamils  should
      be permitted to celebrate openly their cultural events.  The  students
      were arrested, charged, and sent for rehabilitation.  He did not  know
      about it personally but he had  read  of  the  students'  arrest.   He
      understood that they were being held on unspecified terrorism  charges
      under the PTA.

  28. In re-examination, Mr Macrae was asked what the political implications
      would be of asserting Tamil identity in Sri Lanka.  He replied that it
      was perceived as declaring a belief in the Tamil nation  or  a  demand
      for more autonomy, and as such, a threat to the Sri Lankan state.   At
      the very least, you would be regarded as being in favour  of  regional
      autonomy.  Sri Lanka at present was an extraordinarily  difficult  and
      fearful society.

  29. For the second appellant, Mr Spurling asked  questions  based  on  the
      facts of his case.  The second appellant had surrendered  to  the  Sri
      Lankan army, been taken to a camp, and arrested after  two  days.   Mr
      Macrae's opinion  on  those  facts  was  that  the  authorities  would
      consider the second appellant to be a Tiger; and  that  on  the  facts
      found in  his  case,  he  would  suffer  almost  certain  torture  and
      imprisonment. His life would be in danger.  He did not  consider  that
      was overstating the situation.  He referred to very disturbing footage
      of a group of girls being taken away by  the  CID,  in  obvious  fear,
      which was distressing to watch.  Many Tigers who surrendered  had  not
      been seen since they were  taken  away;  their  whereabouts  were  not
      known.  He was unaware how the second appellant  had  managed  to  get
      away but he was aware of a number of stories of release in return  for
      money.  Sri Lanka was a very corrupt society.

  30. In answer to questions from the Tribunal, Mr Macrae explained that the
      films he made had originated from some footage which  Channel  4  News
      obtained of the execution of Tamil prisoners, in 2010.  Channel 4  had
      been reporting from the camps and from the civil war.  They  had  been
      quite critical of the conditions in  the  UN  IDP  camps,  which  were
      fenced in and guarded by armed guards.  The footage, taken just before
      or after the end of the conflict in 2009, had been sent to the UN, who
      considered it likely to be genuine.  Channel 4  had  it  independently
      assessed and were told that there was no manipulation of the images.

  31. Mr Macrae had worked on the first film from receipt  of  those  images
      until July 2011, when it  was  shown.   He  had  started  work  almost
      immediately on the second film, which he worked on from the autumn  of
      2011 until February 2012, when it was transmitted.  He was now at work
      on the third instalment, using some  material  from  the  earlier  two
      films.  The 2013 episode would be 90 minutes long and was intended  as
      a film of record.  He had read the LLRC in full  while  preparing  the
      2012 film but had  not  looked  at  it  subsequently.   The  areas  he
      remembered in its recommendations were those which  were  relevant  to
      his work, and he had filtered them some time ago in  putting  together
      the 2012 episode of the "Sri Lanka's Killing Fields" series.   He  had
      prepared his statement personally.

  32. There was no additional cross-examination  or  re-examination  arising
      out of the Tribunal's questions.

                                 APPENDIX I

                           PROFESSOR ANTHONY GOOD

   1. We have been provided with two written reports from Professor  Anthony
      Good, Professor Emeritus in Social Anthropology at the  University  of
      Edinburgh, where he was the Head of the School of Social and Political
      Studies until retiring in July 2009.  He is currently working with  Dr
      Robert Gibb, of Glasgow University, on a project funded by the Arts  &
      Humanities  Research  Council  entitled  'the  Conversion  of   Asylum
      Applicants'.

   2. His reports, dated 27 January 2013 and 5 February  2013  respectively,
      cover a general range of issues including the Prevention of  Terrorism
      Act  ('PTA')  and  emergency  regulations  ('ER'),  the  incidence  of
      torture, release through bribery, continuing interest  after  release,
      the consequence of  not  being  screened,  the  role  of  paramilitary
      groups, the general situation  in  Tamil  majority  areas,  Tamils  in
      Colombo,  continuing  level  of  interest  of  those  with  actual  or
      perceived LTTE links, participation in anti-Sri  Lanka  demonstrations
      overseas, the background political and human rights situation  in  Sri
      Lanka, risk at the international airport and the LP risk factors.

   3. Professor Good was a founder member of Centre for South Asian Studies.
      He holds Doctorates in Chemistry and Social Anthropology.  He lived in
      Sri Lanka between 1970 - 72 where he was a senior lecturer in Physical
      Chemistry at the University of Ceylon.  He made fact-finding visits to
      Sri Lanka in August 2003 and February 2006 and paid a further visit to
      Colombo in February  2010  to  interview  chief  executives  of  three
      internationally recognised human rights NGOs. Since his retirement  he
      has continued to teach, write and research into South  Asian  society,
      history and culture, with special reference to Tamils. He states  that
      several PhD students and one other Professor of Social Anthropology at
      Edinburgh University are actively conducting research on Sri Lanka and
      he exchanges information on a regular basis with them.  He was awarded
      the Lucy Mair medal in 2010 by the Royal Anthropological Institute  as
      recognition of his work in the international  development  and  asylum
      fields. He has now written over 400 expert reports for asylum appeals,
      mostly involving Sri Lankans and gave evidence in the four most recent
      Sri Lanka Country Guidance appeals.

   4. Professor Good's reports are prepared on behalf of the third appellant
      but are of general relevance. In his first report, he quoted at length
      from source documents on which he relied.  The key points we draw from
      his report are as follows:

       a) The present government of Sri Lanka is dominated by the  Rajapaksa
          family.  Three of the Rajapaksa brothers  hold  between  them  the
          presidency of Sri Lanka and five government ministries,  including
          the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. A fourth brother is
          currently Speaker of the Sri Lankan parliament;

       b) Both the  authorities  and  the  pro-LTTE  Tamils  circulate  much
          misleading and even false information, both within Sri  Lanka  and
          abroad;

       c) The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA)  and  Emergency  Regulations
          required   periodic   Parliamentary   renewal.    The    Emergency
          Regulations lapsed on 31 August 2011 and were not renewed, but the
          principal provisions thereof were then incorporated, and  in  some
          cases made more stringent, in the PTA, which remains in force. The
          PTA permits arrest without warrant for a broad range of  offences,
          and permits  detention  without  charge  or  judicial  supervision
          (production before a court) for up to 18 months, as opposed to the
          90 days provided in the Emergency Regulations before they  lapsed.
          The PTA permits  the  admission  of  confessions  made  without  a
          magistrate present, with the burden of proving  a  confession  was
          obtained coercively being on a defendant,  thus  facilitating  the
          use of torture against those detained under the PTA. Acts  carried
          out in 'good faith' under the PTA are immune from Judicial Review;



       d) Over the entire period of the  ethnic  conflict,  and  thereafter,
          there has been consistent and overwhelming evidence of the routine
          use of torture by the security forces, paramilitary groups and the
          LTTE. Such  practices  are  deeply  engrained  in  routine  police
          behaviour. There continue  to  be  reports  of  torture  of  Tamil
          detainees even in formal prisons and there is no evidence that the
          incidence of torture has decreased since the end of the conflict;

       e) Many LTTE suspects who were released were unable  to  return  home
          and/or were under regular security surveillance;

       f) According to Sri Lanka Department  of  Prisons  statistics,  there
          were between 200 and 300 prison escapes per  year  in  the  period
          2002-2011.  There  are  no   comparable   statics   for   informal
          detentions.  Informal  detentions  tend  to  be  in  less   secure
          facilities than formal detentions;

       g) Corruption and bribery are widespread in Sri Lanka,  and  includes
          those at the top of the political system and the  police.  Release
          through payment of a bribe is 'extremely common';

       h) The release of a detainee does not of  itself  indicate  that  the
          authorities have no continuing interest in  that  person.  Release
          without charge or without the payment of a bribe does not preclude
          subsequent detention. There is evidence of re-arrest and abduction
          of former LTTE cadres on  the  East  Coast  and  in  the  Northern
          Province in 2011 and 2012;

       i) It is easy to obtain a false passport or a genuine passport  in  a
          false name in Sri Lanka;

       j) There has been a computerised database of both  ordinary  criminal
          and LTTE suspects available since at least 1999. There has,  since
          then, been a cumulative process of refining  the  IT  systems  and
          information sources.  The  evidence  strongly  suggests  that  the
          backgrounds of returning asylum seekers who have  previously  been
          in detention or appear on wanted lists are likely to be  known  to
          the authorities. It is reasonable to conclude  that  where  events
          that took place long ago are less likely to be recorded on central
          databases and events that took place in Colombo are more likely to
          have been recorded;

       k) The details contained in such records would not routinely be known
          to all relevant personnel at the  airport.  Immigration  officials
          have access to information from CID and SIS databases.

       l) The use of "watch" and "stop" lists continue  at  Colombo  airport
          but whilst immigration officers know when a person is on an  alert
          list they do not have access to the databases and do not know  the
          reasons why a person is on such list;

       m) There are also CID and SIS personnel at the airport;

       n) Details of returnees, even if not returned on  a  charter  flight,
          would be communicated to the Sri Lankan authorities in advance  by
          the Sri Lankan High Commission;

       o) Virtually the entire population of Vanni were interned  after  the
          end of the civil war in a screening process  seeking  to  identify
          LTTE cadres;

       p) Those who have been through the rehabilitation process are  issued
          with a Release Certificate valid for 6 months which  specifies  an
          address at which they are  to  reside.  These  persons  must  also
          register with the military's Civil Affairs Office;

       q) All those returning, including IDPs, must register with the  local
          Grama Niladhari;

       r) Whilst there have been improvements in the  Northern  Province  in
          terms of construction and  restoration  of  basic  infrastructure,
          there is now a high level of militarisation in  Tamil  areas.  The
          Northern  Province  is  dominated  by  army  presence.  Legitimate
          political activity is restricted in Jaffna and  said  to  be  non-
          existent in Vanni. The army are engaging in commercial activity to
          the detriment of Tamil farmers and trader;

       s) There has been an upsurge of arrests  and  abductions  of  persons
          with suspected LTTE links in Jaffna in recent months;

       t) The  number  of  checkpoints  in  Colombo  continues  to  decline.
          Abductions in Colombo have continued.  Wealthier  Tamils  such  as
          established businessmen face risks of abduction and kidnapping for
          ransom. An 'incomer' to  Colombo  may  lack  the  social  networks
          necessary to obtain employment easily;

       u) The LTTE has lost the capacity to undertake conventional  military
          conflict. It cannot be said that the level  of  interest  in  LTTE
          suspects  on  the  part  of  the  authorities  has   significantly
          decreased. The Sri Lankan government is explicitly continuing  its
          energetic tracking down of persons suspected of LTTE  involvement.
          Many  of  those  that  have  been  through   the   screening   and
          rehabilitation process remain under intensive surveillance.  There
          is no evidence to suggest that the  mere  passage  of  time  is  a
          factor in reducing the level of interest  in  those  suspected  of
          LTTE involvement;

       v) It is extremely likely that the Sri  Lankan  authorities  actively
          monitor protests by Tamils in London. It  is  likely  that  anyone
          known to have participated in such demonstrations will be a  focus
          of suspicion  by  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities.  The  Sri  Lankan
          government explicitly threatened to arrest those participating  in
          the demonstration in the United Kingdom in 2010 against  President
          Rajapaksa's visit to London, should  they  return  to  Sri  Lanka.
          Hundreds of photographs of demonstrations in  London  are  in  the
          public domain;

       w) There is a general climate of intimidation and repression  of  the
          media  and  civil  society  organisations.  It   is   common   for
          journalists to receive death threats and  a  number  of  prominent
          journalists have been killed

       x) The risk factors in LP are all still  applicable.  Two  additional
          risk  factors  may  now  be  relevant;  (a)  Those   involved   in
          demonstration against the Government of Sri Lanka whilst  overseas
          and (b) Those  involved  in  independent  media  or  human  rights
          activities critical of the Government of Sri Lanka.

       y) In general, the third appellant's account is  entirely  consistent
          with the chronology of the ethnic conflict, and with what is known
          about  in-country  conditions  during  and  after  the   conflict,
          including but not confined to the conduct of the LTTE and security
          forces. Nothing in his account appears inherently  implausible  or
          inconsistent with that country of origin evidence;

       z) If the third appellant were detained by  the  authorities  at  the
          airport, or thereafter, it is highly likely he  would  suffer  ill
          treatment possibly amounting to torture,  even  if  his  detention
          were official.

   5. In answer to written questions asked  on  behalf  of  the  respondent,
      Professor Good stated as follows:  A number  of  the  questions  dealt
      with matters where  Professor  Good  felt  that  he  had  insufficient
      knowledge to give an expert opinion.

        a) In general the Sri Lankan authorities  would  be  suspicious  of
           persons from cities with substantial  Tamil  populations.  Other
           than London, this includes Toronto, Oslo  and Paris;

        b) There is likely to be a risk from the authorities at the airport
           in Colombo for those forced returnees who have  previously  been
           suspected of LTTE involvement or who display others of the  risk
           factors enumerated in LP. To the extent that there is monitoring
           or  observation  by  the  Embassy  or  High  Commission  of  the
           deporting  country  this  is  likely  to  reduce  the  risk   of
           gratuitous detention and ill-treatment at the airport;

   6. In his Supplementary Report of the  5  February  2013  Professor  Good
      added the following:

        a) For 'normal' flights the Sri Lankan authorities have a  standard
           passenger manifest supplied by the airline.

        b) A citizen of Sri Lanka is required to complete a  disembarkation
           card on arrival at Colombo  airport.  The  information  required
           includes the person's onward  address  within  Sri  Lanka.  This
           document is not computerised.

   7. Professor Good also gave lengthy and detailed oral  testimony  to  the
      tribunal, adopting both his reports as evidence in  chief.  In  cross-
      examination, he confirmed that there were newspapers  and  Sri  Lankan
      journalists in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, but that there  are
      restrictions placed on what they could report. They are also  excluded
      from designated high security areas.

   8. He gave two examples of disinformation circulated by  the  Sri  Lankan
      authorities; the first being that for a  significant  period  the  Sri
      Lankan government denied there were any civilian casualties during the
      end of the civil war, despite there being overwhelming evidence to the
      contrary, and the second being that he had seen reports  referring  to
      recent pro-LTTE activity which in fact  related  to  events  that  had
      occurred a year earlier.

   9. Asked whether he considered that there had been systematic large-scale
      torture of Tamils detained in camps at  the  end  of  the  civil  war,
      Professor Good said that the information in this regard was patchy. He
      speculated that in many cases people were not tortured.

  10. Professor Good was taken to a passage from an International Commission
      of Jurists (ICJ) report of November 2011, cited at paragraph 29 of his
      first report and asked why the undertaking of medical examination  for
      those detained under the PTA would have as its purpose the  protection
      of  the  authorities  from  future  torture  petitions.  In   response
      Professor Good indicated that the Supreme Court had found in favour of
      torture victims, although he was unable to assist the tribunal  as  to
      whether those judgements had been implemented.

  11. Professor Good further explained that  detention  under  the  PTA  had
      become more formal since the end of the civil  war,  although  he  was
      unsure as to the current formal procedure. He accepted that he had  no
      idea as to the number of new  PTA  cases  that  had  been  registered,
      explaining that it  was  difficult  to  obtain  statistics  about  the
      operation of legal process in Sri Lanka.

  12. Mr Hall put to Professor Good that his conclusion found  at  paragraph
      40 of his first report, that the third appellant would be detained  by
      the authorities at the airport upon  return,  could  not  be  correct;
      inviting Professor Good to identify what facility there was  available
      at Colombo airport for detaining persons.  Professor  Good's  accepted
      that he was unsure whether a person could be held in detention at  the
      airport, and acknowledged that  he  could  not  recall  any  cases  of
      persons being held  at  the  airport  for  a  significant  period.  He
      emphasised however that a person would be taken to  the  CID  and  SIS
      offices at the airport, and that the SIS computer system is accessible
      there.

  13. In relation to the third appellant, Professor Good accepted that there
      was no evidence that there is a court order or arrest warrant  against
      him, or that  he  had  jumped  bail  or  escaped  from  detention.  He
      observed, however, that it was not impossible that  a  record  of  the
      third appellant's original detention would be contained on  the  SIS's
      database. It is more likely that the Sri Lankan authorities would have
      connected the third appellant to his brother. In addition, information
      about the third appellant would have been provided to the  Sri  Lankan
      authorities by the Sri Lankan High Commission. He  is  unable  to  say
      whether the Sri Lankan authorities would have put the appellant  on  a
      watch list. Professor Good then observed  that  a  great  majority  of
      people detained for interrogation  were  ill-treated.  Professor  Good
      continued by confirming that approximately  300,000  people  had  been
      questioned and screened and that although there was little information
      available regarding this  process,  he  understands,  from  reading  a
      report issued in September 2011 by the French OFPRA  entitled  Rapport
      de mission en Republique democratic et socialist de Sri  Lanka  [cited
      at paragraph 113 of Professor Good's  first  report],  that  detainees
      were classified into categories A to E, category A being high  ranking
      LTTE figures and E being those with a  short  lived  LTTE  connection.
      Professor Good accepted that he had no insight into the rehabilitation
      process over and above  the  reports  he  had  cited  in  his  written
      evidence. Mr Hall asked Professor Good what size the prison population
      in Sri Lanka is. Professor Good confirmed that he had no knowledge  of
      this fact.

  14. Questions  then  turned  to  the  issue  of  bribery;  Professor  Good
      commented that it was difficult to study bribery.  He  confirmed  that
      the Bribery Commission in Sri Lanka  had  been  reconstituted  in  May
      2011. He could not say who  appointed  the  Commission's  members,  or
      whether it was independent of the Sri Lankan authorities. Dealing with
      the incidence of bribery, he stated that officials at all levels  were
      not permitted to take bribes, but in practice,  the  payment  of  very
      small bribes to state employees  was  ubiquitous  in  Sri  Lanka,  and
      higher officials also took bribes, in  larger  amounts  due  to  their
      status and greater influence.  Where a person complained  about  being
      asked for or paying a  bribe,  the  matter  was  normally  dealt  with
      internally, though occasionally such complaints went as far  as  Court
      proceedings.

  15. Asked in cross-examination about  evidence  of  immigration  officials
      being bribed not to scan a passport during an individual's  exit  from
      Sri Lanka at Bandaranaike Airport in Colombo, Professor Good explained
      that he had written expert reports for a large  number  of  appellants
      who had stated that this had occurred.  He  had  no  direct  knowledge
      whether it did, but assumed that what  happened  was  that  the  agent
      might tell his client to approach a particular immigration official at
      the airport with whom the agent had  a  financial  arrangement.   Some
      people might just exit Sri Lanka on false passport  or  on  a  genuine
      passport in a false name.

  16. Asked whether, were a bribe was paid to secure  release  from  custody
      that would include the provision of a release form indicating that the
      person was of no further  interest  to  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities,
      Professor Good considered that to  be  possible.   He  personally  had
      never seen a release form, save the specimen  form  exhibited  to  the
      Norwegian COI (Landinfo) report on the release of rehabilitees.

  17. Asked whether an individual, who had been detained before the  end  of
      the civil war and then apparently successfully 'rehabilitated',  would
      be of less interest to the Sri Lankan authorities after  his  release,
      Professor Good referred to the Norwegian Landinfo report;  much  would
      depend on the individual military commanders in  the  area  where  the
      individual lived after his rehabilitation.  Rehabilitees were required
      to register with, and report to the civil and military authorities  in
      their home area after rehabilitation. Some military commanders took  a
      much more intrusive approach,  requiring  more  regular  reporting.  A
      rehabilitee was required to notify the authorities if they  wished  to
      travel outside the area where they were living.

  18. In his first report, Professor Good had stated that those who had been
      through  the  rehabilitation   process   remained   under   'intensive
      surveillance' as set out at paragraphs 98, 114 and 153 of that report.
       In cross-examination, he was asked to comment further, and he  stated
      that the 'surveillance' consisted in most cases of  regular  reporting
      to  the  military  authorities  in  the  home  area,  but  that  also,
      intelligence  operations  had  been  strengthened  in   the   Northern
      Province, with many  informers  operating  within  local  populations.
      Rehabilitees were given IOM  cards  and  in  some  circumstances  were
      eligible  for  benefits  from  the  IOM.   The  IOM  kept   track   of
      rehabilitees and maintained records concerning them.  The  police  had
      tried to introduce a process of registration in Colombo  in  2011  but
      discontinued it after vigorous community protests.

  19. Dealing then with the question of abduction of  former  LTTE  members,
      Professor Good said that such abductions occurred  for  a  variety  of
      motives.  There was evidence of abduction of  individuals  by  unknown
      persons in white vans, some of whom ended up in  the  custody  of  the
      security forces.  He had given  some  recent  examples  in  his  first
      report:  around 45 former LTTE cadres and  their  family  members  had
      been picked up in one week in December 2012, according to  records  of
      complaints kept by the Sri Lankan Human Rights  Commission,  but  that
      was a low figure since according to TamilNet, the  occupying  military
      forces had sternly warned family members in the Northern Province  not
      to complain to the Commission.  Those who were taken to military camps
      were fingerprinted and asked about their current social and  political
      connections, as well as those of their  friends  and  relatives.   His
      evidence on this point was derived from a number of  articles  on  the
      website  TamilNet.  Professor  Good  was  unable  to  add   any   more
      information on this point.

  20. Questions then turned to the relevance of  activities  by  Sri  Lankan
      nationals in the diaspora.  Toronto had the largest Sri  Lankan  Tamil
      diaspora. When asked whether he considered that there  was  a  greater
      risk for those returning from London or Toronto, Professor Good stated
      that risk depended on an individual's circumstances, rather  than  his
      country of refuge.  The Sri Lankan authorities had additional concerns
      about those  returned  from  London,  where  the  Tamil  diaspora  was
      particularly active.  The  GOSL's  attitude  had  hardened  after  the
      humiliation President Rajapaksa suffered in June 2012 during his visit
      to the United Kingdom for the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations.  He
      was forced by demonstrators to travel incognito to  Marlborough  House
      in London rather than using his own limousine, and his  invitation  to
      speak at the Oxford Union was withdrawn as he was considered to pose a
      public order risk.

  21. Professor Good confirmed that the GOSL was concerned  that  the  Tamil
      diaspora continued to raise funds for the LTTE and to  try  to  revive
      the conflict in Sri Lanka.   Professor  Good  stated  that  there  was
      evidence of fundraising but that he did not know the  purpose  of  the
      fundraising, nor was he aware of any  communication  networks  between
      the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Tamil  diaspora  with  a  view  to  LTTE
      resurgence in Sri Lanka. There was a Tamil government in exile [[31]].
       He considered it obvious that the GOSL did not regard  all  returnees
      from abroad as a terrorist threat.

  22. Professor Good could neither confirm nor rebut the suggestion that the
      UNHCR had no presence now in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.

  23. In re-examination, Professor  Good  observed  that  the  LTTE  had  no
      fighting capacity by the end of 2009 and that  the  Sri  Lankan  armed
      forces have tripled in size since the end of the civil  war  and  that
      there is a need  for  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  to  justify  this
      increase. He could not say whether there existed in the rehabilitation
      camps any judicial process for establishing who was a  member  of  the
      LTTE but in his opinion, absent any  evidence  that  such  a  judicial
      process existed, it was likely that there was none.




                                 APPENDIX J

                               DR CHRIS SMITH

    1. Dr Chris Smith is an Associate Fellow of  the  Royal  Institute  for
       International Affairs, Chatham House, London; a Visiting  Fellow  at
       the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, London and a Visiting  Fellow
       in the Department of Politics at the University of Bristol. In  2012
       he was appointed as a Senior Security Sector Advisor to  the  United
       Nations in Iraq and the Iraqi National Security Council. He is  also
       a freelance researcher  and  has  established  his  own  consultancy
       company.

    2. Until January 2005 he was the Deputy Director at  the  International
       Policy  Institute,  King's  College,  and  London  where  he  worked
       predominantly on security issues in South Asia  over  the  past  two
       decades.  He had delivered many academic papers and lectures on  Sri
       Lanka and in particular on the security sector there.  Between  1992
       and 2005 Dr Smith advised policy makers on Sri Lanka, including  the
       Foreign and Commonwealth Office, The British High Commission in  Sri
       Lanka, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for  International
       Development. In 2002  Dr  Smith  was  a  technical  advisor  to  the
       Government of Sri Lanka's Defence Review Committee. He gave evidence
       in the country guidance cases of LP, AN & SS and TK. He has  visited
       Sri Lanka on five occasions since the decision in TK [October 2009],
       for a month or more on each occasion. He last visited Sri  Lanka  in
       November and December 2012 in preparation for his  evidence  in  the
       instant cases.

    3. Dr Smith has provided us with four written  reports;  two  upon  the
       request of the third appellant, dated 24 January 2013 and 28 January
       2013, one at the request of the second appellant  dated  30  January
       2013 and one at the request of the first appellant dated  13  August
       2012. These reports cumulatively total  155  pages.  Although  these
       reports deal specifically with the circumstances of  the  appellants
       that requested their  production,  each  primarily  deals  with  the
       general circumstances in Sri Lanka.

   General observations in the four reports

    4.      Dr Smith provides the  following  general  information  in  his
       reports concerning the three appellants.  We  deal  later  with  his
       observations on each individual appellant's account.

    5.      The civil war ended  in  2007  in  the  Eastern  Province,  but
       continued in the Northern Province of the country  until  May  2009.
       Tamil civilians were encouraged to relocate east to  no  fire  zones
       for safety.  In the aftermath of the civil war,  some  300,000  IDPs
       were transferred to camps in the Vavuniya district. Records of  IDPs
       were drawn up, not least to allow the authorities  to  issue  ration
       books. IDPs were also screened to assess possible links to the  LTTE
       and encouraged to self-identify, however short  their  service  with
       the LTTE.

    6.      In the aftermath of the end of the civil war thousands of  IDPs
       were kept in makeshift camps, with access to, and for,  the  outside
       world being severely limited.  It  is  thought  that  the  screening
       process for LTTE supporters was extremely rigorous  and  there  have
       been reports that this process involved torture. An estimated  12000
       people with even the most tenuous links to the  LTTE  were  detained
       after having been through the screening process. The family  members
       of those detained were not informed of the detention. The Sri Lankan
       government denies both that the level of  civilian  death  had  been
       significant and that sexual violence had taken place in  the  camps.
       The camps were dismantled in 2012 as a result  largely  of  pressure
       from the international  community.  There  have  been  no  terrorist
       incidents since May 2009.

    7.      There  is  unequivocal  and  universal  relief  in  Sri  Lanka,
       including of the Tamil population of Vanni, that the civil  war  has
       ended. The Sri Lankan security  services  are  seeking  to  identify
       whether or not there is a threat that LTTE remnants might combine to
       provide a national security threat. The authorities continue to have
       an  adverse  interest  in  even  low-level  cadres  who   had   been
       conscripted into the LTTE. There is evidence that former LTTE cadres
       who have been rehabilitated are being  rearrested.  The  authorities
       are likely to detain anyone they think might be an LTTE cadre.  Both
       the EPDP (in  the  Northern  Province)  and  TMVP  (in  the  Eastern
       Province) joined the Sri Lankan authorities in common cause  against
       the LTTE. Both groups continue to bear arms and indulge in  criminal
       activity and acts of violence.

    8.      During 2012, the Sri Lankan authorities began search operations
       in the Eastern Province, in the belief that LTTE cadres had returned
       to the country.  The  Army  is  conducting  a  massive  intelligence
       operation across Vanni with every village having an informant (known
       as a catcher). New arrivals in any particular area  are  scrutinised
       by the catcher. The fact that a person from Vanni had missed out  on
       the 'screening' process would not of itself  entail  any  particular
       consequences.

    9.      The principal mechanism though which people are  likely  to  be
       tracked down is through the Watch  list,  which  forms  part  of  an
       electronic database that alerts the authorities  to  the  return  of
       someone who is of adverse interest and is  used  to  trigger  covert
       surveillance.

   10. The electronic records held by the Sri  Lankan  authorities  include
       records of individuals who are of  adverse  interest  to  them.  The
       centralised collection of records  began  in  the  mid  1990s.  Once
       details of a detainee have been entered on the database they  remain
       there for life. If an entry includes mention of  an  arrest  warrant
       the individual will be put on a Stop list. The database is available
       to the authorities at  the  airport  and  in  some  police  stations
       including CID headquarters in Colombo. Although  not  currently  the
       case, all police stations are shortly to  be  linked  electronically
       into one network. The electronic database has recently  been  linked
       to the emigration system.

   11. Every detention of a suspect by the security forces  (including  the
       police) resulted in a record being raised and where possible,  these
       records would be sent to the next of kin, the Grama Sevaka  and  the
       Head of Divisional headquarters. Records were drawn up for all  LTTE
       suspects and lodged with the Ministry of Rehabilitation, the SIS and
       Military  Intelligence.   These  records  were  transferred  to  the
       centralised database.

   12. Legal employment cannot be obtained without an identity card, and it
       is generally necessary to hold an  ID  card  in  Colombo  to  obtain
       rental accommodation, and access to medical care.  It can take up to
       a year and a half  to  obtain  an  ID  card,  and  this  process  is
       particularly  difficult  for  those  who  do  not   have   a   birth
       certificate, passport or serial number  from  a  previous  ID  card.
       'This will require a trip back to the district of origin to  request
       the Grama Sevaka to certify identity'.  There  is  a  commitment  in
       Colombo that an ID card replacement will take place within 24 hours,
       but this will require all the necessary documents to  be  submitted.
       It is estimated that in excess of 100,000 Tamils were without an  ID
       card at the end of the civil war. In July 2010, the police began  to
       register all Tamils in Wellawatte, a Tamil district of  Colombo.  It
       has been reported that this was discontinued  because  of  community
       protests.

   13. Anyone with even the most tenuous links to the LTTE in the  Northern
       and Eastern Province at the end of the civil war in 2009 would  have
       been screened extremely closely and records drawn up. These  records
       would eventually  have  been  included  on  a  central  database  in
       Colombo. If a bribe was used to short circuit the screening process,
       the person will have been recorded as an  unacquitted  suspect.   If
       someone of adverse interest is released upon  payment  of  a  bribe,
       those who accepted the bribe will be responsible for ensuring  there
       is a record of why the suspect was released; a note indicating  that
       a person was released because they  were  a  person  of  no  further
       interest, being one option. If the person  who  accepted  the  bribe
       could not acquire access to the records, it is more likely that they
       would report the 'release' as an  escape  which  would  lead  to  an
       arrest warrant being issued. Someone who is recorded as  escaped  or
       missing would be of significant adverse interest to the authorities.



   14. Not all Sri Lankans who claim asylum in foreign countries, including
       the United Kingdom, are  of  adverse  interest  to  the  Sri  Lankan
       authorities. Staff at the Sri Lankan High Commission in London  pass
       details of all removals to the security forces in  Colombo  and  all
       incoming flights to  Colombo  are  required  to  fax  the  passenger
       manifest in advance.

   15. All  returned  failed  asylum  seekers  are  questioned  at  Colombo
       airport. The incidents of detention at the  airport  have  increased
       since TK, despite the civil war having  ended.   Initially  officers
       from the DIE interview all returnees. Once satisfied that  a  person
       is of Sri Lankan origin, returnees are referred to the CID and  SIS.
       Each  part  of  the  Sri  Lankan  security  apparatus  has  its  own
       intelligence section and the respective sections do not  communicate
       with each other.

   16. According to the Sri Lankan government,  'asylum  seekers  are  hard
       core LTTE members', but there is evidence to indicate that  the  Sri
       Lankan authorities know that some Sri Lankans  leave  their  country
       because they are economic migrants rather than terrorists.

   17. There is an electronic database available  at  the  airport  in  Sri
       Lanka. If an entry on the electronic  database  mentions  an  arrest
       warrant, the person to whom it relates is placed on  a  "stop"  list
       and is detained immediately on return. If a person is on  the  Watch
       list on the electronic database they will be allowed to proceed  but
       the authorities will be notified. The Stop and Watch lists form  the
       core of the electronic database.

   18. Direct and instant access to the  electronic  database  is  probably
       confined to the airport and intelligence headquarters.  The  SIS  is
       often notified about planned enforced returns from the UK by the Sri
       Lankan High Commission in London. The  electronic  database  is  not
       widely available elsewhere in Sri Lanka and is not available at  the
       largest checkpoint in Sri Lanka, at Omanthai.  Police  stations  are
       not electronically networked and most do not even have computers.

   19. The CID do not have unlimited access to the SIS electronic database.
       They can access the database on a case by case basis. The CID has  a
       24 hour presence at Colombo airport. There are 2 main lists  at  the
       airport to alert the authorities of someone  of  adverse  interests;
       the "watch" list and the "stop" list. Those on the Watch  list  will
       likely be placed under surveillance, especially on return  to  their
       homes. They may be asked to report and may receive visits  from  the
       authorities. The airport remains a major area of  vulnerability  for
       returning asylum seekers but in some cases risk continues after  the
       airport;

   20. UNHCR data for 2011 indicated that 75% of refugee returns under  the
       voluntary repatriation scheme  were  contacted  in  their  homes  by
       either the military or the police for further registration.  26%  of
       returnees were visited on more than one occasion.   Every  returning
       person  to  the  Vanni  must  register  their  presence   with   the
       authorities.

   21. Scarring remains an issue for returned asylum seekers, and has  long
       been considered in Sri Lanka to be a  significant  indicator  as  to
       whether a Tamil might have been involved in the  LTTE.  When  people
       are detained for other reasons they are stripped to their  underwear
       during interrogation. Scarring is not a  significant  issue  on  its
       own, but is important in its contribution to "rousing suspicion".

   22. As of January 2013, the Sri Lankan government admitted  that  26,000
       persons from the camps have been unable to return to their homes  in
       government restricted areas.  The majority (75%) of the  Sri  Lankan
       Army's  divisions  are  now  stationed  in  the  Northern  Province;
       possibly  amounting  to  180,000  personnel.   There   is   on-going
       construction of new cantonments. The army runs small  businesses  in
       Vanni and has  opened  one  hotel  and  is  building  another.   The
       behaviour of the  military  as  an  occupying  force  is  driven  by
       individual commanders.

   23. In December 2009, the EU adopted a proposal  to  suspend  a  trading
       concession scheme to Sri Lanka, based primarily on Sri Lanka's human
       rights record.  In 2010, the UN Special  Rapporteur  called  for  an
       enquiry into possible war crimes  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  government's
       response to war crimes allegation was to set up the  Lessons  Learnt
       and  Reconciliation  Committee  (LLRC).  The  December   2011   LLRC
       concluded that the Sri Lankan military gave the highest priority  to
       protecting civilians, but accepted  that  civilian  casualties  were
       caused by government shelling during the civil war.  The  government
       has a National Action Plan  to  co-ordinate  implementation  of  the
       LLRC's findings.

   24. There are only limited ways in which the Sri Lankan authorities  can
       identify an individual who has provided evidence on war crimes.  One
       such way would be if an individual is  on  record  as  having  given
       evidence to the LLRC.

   25. The incidence of torture had not decreased  since  the  end  of  the
       civil  war  or  since  TK  was  decided.   Although  the   Emergency
       Regulations (ERs) were lifted in 2011 the  Prevention  of  Terrorism
       Act (PTA) was amended at  the  same  time,  to  incorporate  matters
       formerly included with the ERs.  The  security  forces  continue  to
       operate in a culture of impunity which neither the President nor the
       Secretary of Defence have done anything to address.

   26. In  recent  years,  physical  attacks  on  journalists  have  become
       commonplace, most of which are  thought  to  be  ordered  by  senior
       politicians against those who criticise how the  conflict  had  been
       handled by the state. The  best-known  example  was  the  murder  of
       Lasantha Wickremetunge, the late Editor of  the  Sunday  Leader  and
       former friend of the President, who researched and published stories
       of abuse of power by the President and his family.

   27. There is a trend  towards  monitoring  and  blocking  websites,  and
       targeting those responsible for websites, that post information  and
       comment considered disadvantageous to the government. Phone  tapping
       has been a fact of life in Sri Lanka for many years. The Sri  Lankan
       government admitted, in 2012,  that  it  was  tapping  687  personal
       phones, including those of politicians, religious leaders, newspaper
       editors and journalists.

   28. Abductions in Jaffna and Colombo are  on  the  increase.  In  the  9
       months to August 2012 58 disappearances occurred.  It takes  a  year
       or more to acquire a replacement of new ID  card,  each  case  being
       investigated by the police. A new ID card is obtained from  a  Grama
       Sevaka in an individual's place of origin. In order to obtain a  new
       card a person must travel to their place of origin.  In  the  Vanni,
       where there was an intensive security operation in  2012  using  the
       "watch" list to identify whom to monitor, anyone  travelling  within
       the area and failing to produce an  ID  card  at  a  checkpoint  was
       detained;

   29.  The  SLHC  in  London   monitors   anti-government   demonstrations
       carefully. SLHC staff take photographs  of  protestors.  It  is  not
       known what happens to the photographs but it is reasonable to assume
       that they are sent to the relevant intelligence section of the State
       Intelligence Service (SIS). Research on  human  face  detection  and
       research  is  underway  within  the  Department  of  Statistics  and
       Computer Science at the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka  and  there
       appears to be joint working with the Ministry of Defence to  develop
       face recognition technology.

   30. Dr Smith considered that the 12 "risk  factors"'  identified  in  LP
       remain valid. In his opinion, four additional risk factors should be
       added:

       a) the lack of an ID card, entailing a need to return  to  the  home
          area, travelling through checkpoints, to  obtain  a  replacement,
          which was likely to lead to detention;
       b) the presence of an LTTE inspired tattoo on a person,
       c)  identification  as  having  protested  against  the  Sri  Lankan
          government whilst outside Sri Lanka; and
       d) having a mental health issue, those  with  mental  health  issues
          being heavily stigmatised in Sri Lanka.

   31. Dr Smith also broadly endorsed the  risk  categories  in  the  UNHCR
       guidelines, although he considered that some of them  would  require
       more research, particularly the final  category  which  referred  to
       LGBTI individuals.

   32. Corruption is widespread in Sri Lanka and has increased dramatically
       in recent years.   The  Commission  to  Investigate  Allegations  of
       Bribery of Corruption received over 3000  complaints  in  2012.  The
       Rajapaksa family control between 40% and 70% of all  state  spending
       and are widely thought to take monies  in  relation  to  most  major
       business contracts coming into Sri Lanka. The President now controls
       the Attorney General's Office. All NGO programme and  project  funds
       must now be held in Sri  Lanka  and  the  government  has  power  to
       confiscate funds from NGOs who fall foul of the state.

   33. The judiciary and police have been wholly ineffective  in  combating
       corruption, and corruption is 'rampant' in the  Sri  Lankan  police.
       The Sri Lankan Supreme Court  has  made  several  decisions  against
       police officers for abuse of power but no action was  taken  against
       them.

   34.  Bribery  is  sufficiently  prevalent  in  Sri  Lanka  to   overcome
       considerations of national security. There  is  evidence  that  even
       senior, known, LTTE officials have been able to secure their release
       from detention through payment of a bribe.  A person of interest can
       exit Sri Lanka though the airport using bribery. People  trafficking
       agents are still very active at the airport and at least one  Member
       of Parliament is involved in organising  irregular  emigration.   Dr
       Smith's understanding was that, for  money,  the  MP  would  provide
       details of an appropriate immigration official to  approach  at  the
       airport. There is a practice  whereby  an  emigration  officer  will
       close down his computer to avoid connecting an individual's passport
       to the system, alternatively the  passport  is  not  swiped  but  is
       stamped, therefore the database is not alerted.

   35. In Colombo, Tamils who are well integrated and have  no  connections
       with the LTTE can largely live as other ethnic groups do in Colombo.
       When stopped in Colombo a Tamil with an ID card from elsewhere  will
       attract greater attention, possibly adverse. If those  from  outside
       Colombo could not provide a valid reason for being there, this would
       lead to a risk of detention.

   36. 11700 LTTE cadres have undergone rehabilitation  and  reintegration.
       According to the IOM Sri Lanka, the rehabilitation process  involves
       preparing ex-combatants for a  future  in  employment  by  providing
       vocational training. It is  not  known  whether  the  rehabilitation
       process contains any form of political re-education;

   37. In relation to the second appellant's case in particular:


        a) the second appellant's  claim  that  his  release  was  procured
           through payment of a bribe to a PLOTE member is plausible;

        b)  It is likely the  authorities  would  have  a  detailed  record
           outlining the scope and nature of adverse interest in the second
           appellant;

        c) The second appellant will have  to  return  to  Point  Pedro  to
           obtain a new ID card. His ID card will therefore indicate he  is
           a Tamil from the Jaffna peninsula and not the former  war  zone.
           He would have difficulties in making the journey to Point  Pedro
           without an ID card and would in particular be stopped at one  of
           the many checkpoints en route. If he were so stopped he would be
           detained;

        d) The duration of the second appellant's  detention  coupled  with
           his status as an unacquitted suspect (depending upon whether and
           how his record was amended after he left detention) may have led
           to his name being placed on the electronic database, which would
           cause an arrest warrant to be issued.

   38. In relation to the first appellant, Dr Smith considered that:

        e) it is plausible that the first appellant was released on payment
           of a bribe as claimed;

        f) it is plausible that the first appellant was ill-treated  whilst
           detained;

        g) the first appellant will  be  questioned  at  the  airport  upon
           return;


   Oral evidence

   39.  Dr  Smith  adopted  his  evidence  and  was  tendered  for   cross-
       examination.  When  cross-examined,  Dr  Smith  accepted  Mr  Hall's
       observation that after the end of the civil war the  SL  authorities
       had amassed a significant amount  of  intelligence  about  the  LTTE
       within Sri Lanka and  about  its  overseas  networks.  He  had  been
       unsuccessful  in  trying  to  obtain  information  as  to  what  the
       rehabilitation process involved.

   40. Dr  Smith  repeated  that  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  were  very
       concerned about a resurgence of the LTTE  and  that  any  resurgence
       would start overseas. In his opinion,  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
       would try and prevent certain people leaving Sri Lanka in order  not
       to encourage resurgence. This would be done through the use  of  the
       electronic  database,  now  accessible  by  both   immigration   and
       emigration staff at Colombo airport. He had not seen a  copy  of  an
       electronic record held on that database but  he  had  discussed  its
       contents with a Sri Lankan intelligence officer, who told  him  that
       the information held included reasons for adverse interest,  biodata
       and family data.

   41. Dr Smith was then asked questions about the checkpoints en route  to
       Colombo airport. He observed that there was an Air Force  checkpoint
       on the 'spur' road to the airport. Foreigners are  let  through.  He
       did not know what happened to Sri Lankans but considered that anyone
       who looked  Sri  Lankan  would  be  stopped,  and  asked  for  their
       passport, national ID card and ticket. As to the security  situation
       in  Colombo  generally  he  explained,  although  there  were  still
       checkpoints in the city, there had been a recent improvement in  the
       atmosphere.

   42. As to whether an arrest warrant would be  issued  against  a  person
       released from detention, Dr Smith considered that this would  depend
       on a number of  factors,  such  as  where  and  how  they  had  been
       arrested. It was more likely that an arrest warrant would be  issued
       for a detention in Colombo than in the Northern Province.  Dr  Smith
       opined that where a person had escaped 'through the back window'  of
       a detention facility that person would be treated as an 'unacquitted
       person' and an arrest warrant would be issued for them.

   43. In relation to the phrase 'unacquitted person',  Dr  Smith  was  not
       aware of (a) whether a  detained  person  is  considered  to  be  an
       'unacquitted person' until they have  been  formally  released,  (b)
       where 'unacquitted persons' are held, (c) whether family members are
       informed of the place of a person's detention, or (d) whether  there
       is a formal process to  end  the  detention  of  a  person  who  was
       detained  irregularly.  He  observed  that  the  use  of  the   term
       'irregular' might not be apt  in  the  circumstances  of  Sri  Lanka
       because what, in the United  Kingdom,  could  be  considered  to  be
       irregular detention was lawful under the PTA.

   44. When asked by Mr Hall whether it would  be  possible  to  obtain  by
       bribery a certified release document stating that a person was of no
       further interest to the authorities, Dr Smith responded by observing
       that most documents could be obtained by bribery in Sri  Lanka.  The
       Police are more corrupt than the army.

   45. Asked whether he knew of any reason  why  in  2013  the  Sri  Lankan
       authorities would wish to  detain  and  torture  a  low  level  LTTE
       suspect, Dr Smith relied on  his  earlier  evidence  about  the  Sri
       Lankan authorities' concerns about LTTE resurgence; the  authorities
       in  Sri  Lanka  are  going  to  extraordinary  lengths  to   prevent
       resurgence occurring.

   46. As to the current situation of the 11,000 LTTE suspects detained  at
       the end of the civil war, Dr Smith observed that although almost all
       of them had been released, some were required to  report  regularly,
       and a few had been re-arrested. He had no information as to why such
       persons had been re-arrested. His information was that the  military
       occupying Vanni know who had past  LTTE  connections;  there  was  a
       highly developed intelligence network in place and  the  authorities
       kept track of former LTTE affiliates and sympathisers.

   47.  Questions  then  turned  to  the  position  of  those  involved  in
       demonstrations  against  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  in   London,
       photographs of those attending, and face recognition technology.  Dr
       Smith could not say whether  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  had  the
       capability to identify a person from a photograph of them  that  had
       been taken at a demonstration in London. He was unaware of what  the
       Sri Lankan authorities did with such photographs once they had  been
       transmitted from London to Colombo. He was unaware whether  the  CID
       now has face recognition technology in their headquarters, but noted
       that (a) such technology was now quite cheap and (b) the Ministry of
       Defence is funding a project at the University of  Colombo  relating
       to face recognition technology. Dr Smith was sure that there were no
       cameras at the airport in Colombo.

   48. Returning to the electronic database, Dr  Smith  agreed  that  if  a
       person was released from detention and no arrest  warrant  had  been
       issued, the electronic database would not record them  as  being  of
       adverse interest. He did not accept the proposition put by  Mr  Hall
       that if a person had not had an arrest warrant issued  against  them
       they would not be recorded as being of adverse interest.

   49. Mr Hall invited Dr Smith to comment on the question as  to  how  the
       authorities in Colombo would know to detain a person who had  passed
       through the airport upon return to Sri Lanka despite there being  an
       arrest warrant outstanding against that person. In response Dr Smith
       recounted his evidence that the electronic database contains a  Stop
       and a Watch list and that if a person is  on  the  Watch  list  they
       would be subject to surveillance after leaving the airport. The  Sri
       Lankan authorities lacked technology so this would likely amount  to
       'following people'.

   50. When asked about persons leaving  Sri  Lanka  and  the  practice  of
       emigration officers shutting down computers, Dr Smith  referred  the
       tribunal to the evidence he  had  provided  on  this  issue  in  his
       written reports. He confirmed his understanding that agents are able
       to ensure that persons  who  are  on  the  electronic  database  are
       nevertheless able to leave Sri Lanka without problem. Dr  Smith  was
       unaware of the cost of a false passport, but was aware that  genuine
       passports can be obtained  illicitly  and  then  unreliable  details
       added thereafter. There is no biometric  testing  in  Sri  Lanka  at
       present although this 'is coming'.

   51. Dr Smith accepted that the Sri Lankan authorities  did  not  believe
       all asylum seekers were LTTE members:  the mere fact that  a  person
       is a Tamil failed asylum seeker would not of itself lead to  adverse
       inferences being  drawn  against  that  person  by  the  Sri  Lankan
       authorities. He confirmed that such a person would be interviewed at
       the airport on return,  and  if  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  were
       satisfied that they were not of  adverse  interest,  they  would  be
       allowed to leave.

   52. As to whether PLOTE have access to the SIS electronic  database,  Dr
       Smith thought not. He confirmed that PLOTE did not operate any camps
       but  they  do  act  as  guards  in  camps  run  by  the  Sri  Lankan
       authorities. Dr Smith  was  unaware  as  to  whether  the  SIS  have
       'stations' throughout Sri Lanka, although he thought this  unlikely.
       He was also unaware as to the number of officials in the  employ  of
       the SIS.

   53. When questioned as to his knowledge of data relating  to  those  who
       had been mistreated after having returned to  Sri  Lanka,  Dr  Smith
       observed that no human rights  organisation  or  NGO  systematically
       monitors the treatment of returnees, and he knew of no  organisation
       that collates information in Sri Lanka that related to failed asylum
       seekers. Dr Smith was aware that the UNHCR holds data on  those  who
       voluntarily return to Sri Lanka, although he was unaware whether  it
       collected data relating to the mistreatment of such returnees.

   54. Dr Smith was unaware of there being any evidence of ill treatment of
       individuals screened by the Sri Lankan authorities at the end of the
       civil war, nor of systematic mistreatment  of  those  who  had  been
       released  from  the  camps.   He   observed,   however,   that   the
       international community had no access to the camps or the  screening
       process.  There was 'a lot of self-censorship' amongst bloggers  and
       journalists in Sri Lanka.

   55. Dr Smith's opinion was that the basic principles as to when  records
       are created in Sri Lanka had not changed since the decision  in  TK,
       reference being made to paragraph 82 of that decision. He  stood  by
       the evidence he had given in TK, as recorded at paragraph 23 of that
       decision, although he is now less  convinced  that  there  exists  a
       comprehensive exchange of information between the CID  and  SIS.  He
       understood that paper records are being added  to  the  computerised
       database in a chronologically backwards order.  Police  stations  in
       the  Northern  Province  are  rudimentary  and  are  not   currently
       computerised, although the plan is to network all police stations.

                           OTHER COUNTRY EVIDENCE

   Professor Rohan Gunaratna

     1. Dr  Rohan  Gunaratna  is  Head  of  the  International  Centre  for
        Political Violence and Terrorism Research and Professor of Security
        Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.  He holds
        a PhD in International Studies from the University of St Andrews in
        Scotland and a Master's degree in International Peace Studies  from
        the University of Notre Dame  in  the  United  States.   He  worked
        previously and the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and  Political
        Violence in the United Kingdom under Professor Paul Wilkinson.

     2. He is a specialist on  the  LTTE.   He  has  interviewed  the  LTTE
        leadership including Prabakharan before his death and also  several
        hundred LTTE cadres, including  in  the  United  Kingdom.   He  has
        written dozens of books on terrorism, has served as a consultant to
        the law enforcement agencies  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  United
        States.  He helped the  GOSL  to  design,  develop,  implement  and
        evaluate the rehabilitation programme for LTTE members and is  thus
        particularly well placed to assist us  as  to  how  that  programme
        operates.  Unfortunately, he has given no details of the  programme
        itself in his statement, but  he  does  assist  us  as  to  how  it
        operated in 2009, and in contrast, how it operates today.

     3. He was called as a witness in relation to the first appellant.   He
        spoke to the first  appellant  on  the  telephone  for  two  hours,
        comparing the first appellant's account with his own  knowledge  of
        the inner workings of the LTTE, which corroborated the  appellant's
        account of his activities as its finance  manager  and  manager  of
        fuel requirements for the LTTE. The finance wing of  the  LTTE  was
        secret; the appellant had knowledge which was  not  in  the  public
        domain.  He considered  that  the  first  appellant's  account  was
        credible, and that if  his  sister,  who  served  in  Prabakharan's
        medical team, had died in the final conflict, it  was  likely  that
        her body might not have been found, as the appellant claimed.

     4. At paragraphs 3.16 and following,  Professor  Gunaratna  considered
        the position relating to the rehabilitation programme.  He made the
        following general points:

           i) Those who, like the first appellant, were arrested before the
              fighting between the government and the LTTE had ended, would
              not have been  automatically  placed  in  the  rehabilitation
              programme;
          ii) Immediately after May 2009, all those  who  surrendered  were
              placed in the rehabilitation programme.
         iii) Those who did not wish  to  surrender  went  to  IDP  welfare
              centres where  they  masqueraded  as  civilians.   Some  were
              successful  in  that;  others  were   identified   by   Tamil
              civilians, or former LTTE cadres  and  supporters  acting  as
              government informants.  They were detained, investigated, and
              either prosecuted or sent to the rehabilitation programme and
              later reintegrated.  Of a total of 12000 LTTE cadres sent for
              rehabilitation, 11500 had  been  through  the  rehabilitation
              programme and been reintegrated.
          iv) Most  of  those  whose  crimes  were  serious  (assassinating
              government leaders, placing bombs in public  places,  killing
              detainees in LTTE prisons, and  so  on),  were  charged,  and
              detained, with a view to prosecution.
           v) Moving on to the situation now, the government's strategy  in
              2013 was to send to the rehabilitation programme 'anyone  the
              government believes can benefit from [rehabilitation]'.  That
              now included some of those who were still  detained  awaiting
              prosecution; there were still a few hundred  LTTE  cadres  in
              that situation. 'Tamilini', the leader of  the  LTTE  women's
              wing, had been transferred to the rehabilitation programme in
              2012.
          vi) In his expert opinion,  LTTE  cadres  deported  from  foreign
              countries are held in  detention,  investigated,  and  either
              prosecuted or rehabilitated.  The criteria had  changed:   in
              2009,  the  rehabilitation  programme  was  used  for   those
              identified by membership of and degree of involvement in  the
              LTTE; now, it was more nuanced and guided by  concerns  about
              the resurgence of the  Tigers  in  the  Tamil  diaspora.  The
              decision whether to  detain  would  be  made  after  a  fact-
              specific assessment by the police, security and  intelligence
              services.
         vii) The GOSL had great trust in the outcome of the rehabilitation
              programme,  believing  that  most  of  those  who  had   been
              rehabilitated would not return to terrorism.  Of  the  11,500
              so far rehabilitated, none had done so, although a dozen  had
              lapsed into ordinary criminal activities. Those who had  been
              through the rehabilitation programme but  whom  the  security
              forces believed to be in communication with 'LTTE  operatives
              in the diaspora' would be rearrested and detained.
        viii) Professor Gunaratna stated  that  he  knew  that  the  reason
              behind the arrest of 45 LTTE cadres in Jaffna who had already
              been through the rehabilitation programme was the  belief  of
              the  security  services  in  Sri  Lanka  that  they  were  in
              communication with LTTE operatives abroad.
          ix) The Sri Lankan High Commission in London, when issuing travel
              documents, would interview returnees and ask them about their
              identity, nationality, and  the  extent  of  their  past  and
              current involvement with the LTTE.  Consular officials in Sri
              Lanka had told him these were standard questions, but that no
              formal security screening was possible overseas.
           x) Returnees were screened at Colombo airport on  return.   They
              were  not  detained  there;  the  airport  had  no  detention
              facilities. Government officials at the airport  to  whom  he
              had spoken indicated that if a returnee was  of  interest  by
              reason of their past or current association with  LTTE  front
              organisations, they would be invited for  an  interview  once
              they had returned home, rather than at the airport.

    5. Attached to Professor Gunaratna's  report  is  an  article  from  Sri
       Lanka's Defence Ministry website[32] reporting a  joint  briefing  he
       carried out on 3 January 2012 with the Australian  High  Commissioner
       for  Sri  Lanka,  Admiral  Thisara   Samarasinghe,   entitled   "High
       Commissioner  for  Sri  Lanka  &  Professor  Rohan  Gunaratna  briefs
       Australian Parliamentarians", in which his contribution  is  recorded
       thus:

              "Professor Gunaratna  began  proceedings  by  explaining  the
              magnitude of the terrorist threat that Sri Lanka had to  face
              and the sophistication and brutality of the  LTTE  which  was
              finally  defeated  militarily  in  2009.  He  explained   the
              circumstances of the humanitarian rescue operation undertaken
              by the Sri Lanka Government to rescue 300,000  civilians  who
              were being held hostage as human  shields.  Speaking  of  his
              involvement in developing a programme for the  rehabilitation
              of  LTTE  ex-combatants,  he  said  that  the  programme  had
              successfully rehabilitated and  reintegrated  most  of  those
              that surrendered (11,600) save a few hundred  who  have  been
              heavily  involved  in  terrorist  activities   against   whom
              judicial  action  would  be  taken  depending   on   evidence
              available.

              Professor Gunaratna also gave details  of  fund  raising  and
              arms procurement that was done by the LTTE in Australia  over
              the years through front organizations and  requested  members
              of parliament not to let front organizations continue  to  do
              the same in the future. Although the LTTE has  been  defeated
              militarily Professor Gunaratna stated  that  LTTE  supporters
              overseas continue to agitate to  revive  the  group.  On  the
              issue  of  reconciliation,  he   said   that   the   Lakshman
              Kadiragamar  Institute   of   International   Relations   and
              Strategic Studies, an institution created in  memory  of  the
              former Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka of Tamil  ethnicity  who
              was assassinated by the LTTE,  has  held  several  rounds  of
              discussions with stakeholders to address various  aspects  of
              reconciliation.  He   requested   that   Australia   consider
              supporting an international conference on  reconciliation  in
              Sri Lanka."

     6. The remarks of High Commissioner Samarasinghe are set out:

                 "High  Commissioner  Samarasinghe   in   his   presentation
                 highlighted Sri Lanka's achievements in the  post  conflict
                 phase including the resettlement of over 90% of  Internally
                 Displaced   Persons,   rehabilitation   of   ex-combatants,
                 reduction of HSZs, withdrawal of Emergency Regulations, de-
                 mining, holding of elections in the North and East etc.

                 He also explained the steps being taken by  the  Government
                 with regard to reconciliation including the launch  of  the
                 Trilingual Policy initiative, large infrastructure projects
                 undertaken  in  the  North,  the  large  amount  of   funds
                 allocated and delivered to develop the North and  East  and
                 the steps taken to recruit over 600 Tamil  speaking  police
                 officers to ensure that persons of Tamil ethnicity would be
                 able to obtain assistance in their own language.

                 The High Commissioner also drew to the attention  to  those
                 present that the Northern Province was growing at a rate of
                 22% in comparison to the  rest  of  the  country  which  is
                 growing at a rate of over 8%. He underscored  the  emphasis
                 placed by the Government of  Sri  Lanka  in  ensuring  that
                 economic development is delivered  to  the  people  of  the
                 North and East quickly as they were the ones most  affected
                 by the conflict.

                 The High Commissioner briefed those  present  on  the  LLRC
                 report and said that the Government was  going  ahead  with
                 the implementation of these recommendations  and  would  be
                 announcing  a  roadmap  for  same  soon.  He   sought   the
                 understanding of the international  community  and  friends
                 such as Australia as Sri Lanka moves towards this  process.
                 He stated that Sri Lanka should be given adequate time  and
                 space to undertake its internal reconciliation process.  As
                 a  case  in  point  he  said  that   following   the   LLRC
                 recommendations the Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Navy  have
                 established  their  own  inquiries   to   investigate   any
                 wrongdoings by service personnel during the conflict.

                 The High Commissioner  said  further  that  he  was  deeply
                 concerned  about  certain  elements  in  the  diaspora   in
                 Australia who were intent on destroying  the  processes  of
                 reconciliation and economic development taking place in Sri
                 Lanka  by  continuing  a   campaign   of   separatism.   He
                 highlighted the involvement of these  diaspora  members  in
                 LTTE and LTTE front activities  and  said  that  they  have
                 already  begun  fundraising  campaigns  for  the  cause  of
                 creating a separate state of Tamil Eelam in Sri  Lanka.  He
                 added that these front organisations were similar to  those
                 set up by the LTTE in  the  Eighties,  through  which  they
                 raised funds and procured arms and  ammunition  to  unleash
                 terrorism in Sri Lanka. He explained to those  present  how
                 the LTTE flag was  used  at  the  Australia  vs  Sri  Lanka
                 cricket match held in Sydney on 17th of February  and  said
                 that it was  regrettable  that  an  international  sporting
                 encounter was used by the pro-LTTE  lobby  to  agitate  for
                 their  cause.   The   High   Commissioner   concluded   his
                 presentation with a photograph depicting a recent  marriage
                 which had taken place between a Sri Lankan  soldier  and  a
                 former LTTE combatant.  He  said  that  reconciliation  was
                 happening in Sri Lanka between the two communities and  the
                 pro-LTTE diaspora should not  be  allowed  to  derail  that
                 process."

Mr Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu

     7. Mr Saravanamuttu  provided  a  written  report.   He  is  Executive
        Director, Centre for Policy Alternatives, Colombo, Sri Lanka and  a
        prominent international human rights campaigner  based  in  Colombo
        with an international reputation.  In  2009  he  received  a  death
        threat and was detained at Colombo airport by the TID.  He received
        Sri Lanka's National Peace Council's first Citizens' Peace Award in
        2010, established "to honour and  encourage  those  individuals  in
        civil society who have demonstrated courage and consistency in  the
        protection of and respect for human rights; peaceful settlement  of
        disputes and promoting increased understanding  between  and  among
        communities". He remains the subject of hostile comment,  including
        a  poster  campaign  in  2013,  for  his  views  on  human  rights,
        governance and transparency in Sri Lanka.[33]

     8. Mr Saravanamuttu was asked a range of questions  but  due  to  time
        pressures his report deals only with the political situation in Sri
        Lanka since the end of the civil war,  and  the  situation  in  the
        former  LTTE  areas.   He  recorded  the  egregious  human   rights
        violations committed, by both sides, and the  disregard  for  human
        life or dignity.  His report sets out  international  and  national
        criticism of the  militarisation  of  the  Northern  Province,  the
        harassment and  threats  to  lawyers  and  journalists,  the  tight
        control over the government in the hands of the Rajapaksa family (a
        total of 200 members of the family now  hold  government  or  civil
        service jobs, the two-term Presidency restriction has been  removed
        from the constitution and a wide  range  of  posts  which  required
        external approval are now in the gift of the  President).   He  set
        out at some length the events concerning  the  impeachment  of  the
        Chief Justice Dr Shirani Bandaranayake  and  her  replacement  with
        Mohan  Peiris,  a  vigorous  public  defender  of   the   Rajapaksa
        government's record internationally.

     9. The Menik Farm camp which after the  civil  war  contained  300,000
        Tamils had closed in September  2012  but  there  remained  serious
        problems with housing those who had been  released,  especially  as
        many had homes in HSZs to which they were not permitted to  return.
        Sinhalisation of the Tamil areas includes:

              "...renaming of places and the building of religious  markers
              of the majority community in areas predominantly inhabited by
              the minority Tamil, Hindu and Christian communities  as  well
              as demographic change."

    10. He explained the deficiencies in the December 2011 LLRC report  and
        its implementation:

              "61. The LLRC recommendations fall into two parts - the first
              dealing with accountability and the last phase of  the  civil
              war  and  the  second  with  reconciliation  and  issues   of
              governance.

              62. On accountability the LLRC  falls  short,  endorsing  the
              GOSL stand  that  it  did  not  target  civilians.  The  LLRC
              however, concedes that inadvertently, GOSL forces could  have
              been  responsible  for  civilian  deaths  and  calls  for  an
              investigation of these instances. The LLRC also  states  that
              the  Channel  4  documentary  contains  serious   allegations
              against the reputation and standing of the GOSL and  than  an
              investigation to clear the name and reputation of the GOSL is
              in  order.  It  further   calls   for   the   re-opening   of
              investigations into the murder of 17 humanitarian workers  in
              2006 and the killing of 5 Tamil  students  on  the  beach  in
              Trincomalee in the East, also in 2006.

              63. On reconciliation and governance,  the  LLRC  endorses  a
              number of proposals and positions taken by civil society  for
              over a decade. In respect  of  the  Rule  of  Law,  the  LLRC
              recommends that the Police be detached from the  Ministry  of
              Defence, independent oversight commissions be established  as
              under  the  now  jettisoned  Seventeenth  Amendment  to   the
              Constitution   and   that   a   Special   Commissioner    for
              Disappearances be appointed.  It  also  calls  for  Right  to
              Information legislation and a Victim and  Witness  Protection
              Act. ...

              65. The GOSL has come up with a National Human Rights  Action
              Plan, which was presented at the UPR and an Action  Plan  for
              the Implementation of the LLRC recommendations in July  2012.
              The  latter  deals   with   a   selected   number   of   LLRC
              recommendations and identifies time-lines for  implementation
              ranging from 3 months to 05 years. The Action Plan identifies
              lead agencies for the implementation of recommendations.

              66.  Critiques  of  the  Action  Plan  have  pointed  to  its
              selectivity, lack of clarity in respect of  commencement  and
              the  over-reliance  on  the  Ministry  of   Defence   and   a
              parliamentary select committee for implementation."

    11. There is little of the witness' own opinion in the report but it is
        useful for the insight it gives into a number of matters with which
        we are concerned and in particular the LLRC.

   Mr P Anton Punethanayagam, LLB (Col), JPUM

    12. Mr Punethanayagam is a barrister practising in  Vavuniya,  who  has
        represented about 3000 persons in custody either for suspected LTTE
        links or under the PTA.  Before being called to the bar in 1994  in
        Colombo,  where  he  practised  until  2000,  he  worked  with  the
        Institute of Human Rights and Home for Human Rights in Colombo.  Mr
        Punethanayagam is Vice Chairman of the Vavuniya branch of  the  Sri
        Lankan  Red  Cross  Society,  President   of   the   Vavuniya   Bar
        Association, Member of the Bar Council and the Legal Aid  Committee
        of the Sri Lankan Bar Association and  President  of  the  Vavuniya
        Prison welfare association. He is a magistrate and a Justice of the
        Peace.  His report was presented in writing only and  the  Tribunal
        did not have the opportunity to hear oral evidence from him.

    13. He states that more than 1000 LTTE cadres are  still  detained  and
        350 have been prosecuted, the government's  focus  being  on  armed
        Tamil resurgence rather than past activities.  The closing  of  the
        main IDP camps was a propaganda measure; the Northern  and  Eastern
        Provinces remain on high security alert.  At  paragraph  8  of  his
        report he stated that:

              "8. The North and East remain on a high  security  alert.  In
              the North, the majority of the  internally  displaced  people
              (IDPs) have been released from the camps  and  the  main  IDP
              camps were closed down as a measure  of  propaganda.  However
              there are considerable number of IDPs who are still  kept  in
              camps due to the fact that their lands were occupied  by  the
              SLA (e.g., Keepapulavu  in  the  Mullaithivu  District).  The
              danger   of   landmines   is   another   problem   preventing
              resettlement. Thousands of LTTE members  surrendered  to  the
              Sri Lankan Army at the end of the civil war in 2009, but  the
              actual number remains a mystery and the Sri Lankan Government
              had failed to provide details of the number of  LTTE  members
              and ordinary civilians suspected of LTTE involvement held  by
              them under the Prevention  of  Terrorism  Act  and  Emergency
              Regulations. Occasionally,  some  senior  LTTE  members  were
              brought before the Court. They are unlikely  to  get  a  fair
              trial, as they  do  not  have  access  to  independent  legal
              representations. Many  LTTE  suspects  are  detained  without
              charge or access  to  legal  representatives  and  no  public
              record of who is alive and detained exists. The plight of the
              many of the LTTE cadres who had surrendered to  the  Army  in
              May 2009 is not to known (E.g. Balakumaran, Paraa, Karikalan,
              Lawrence and Rev. Fr. Francis Joseph who came along with  the
              injured LTTE cadres)."

    14. He deals with the incorporation of the Emergency  Regulations  into
        the PTA and the human rights violations at the  end  of  the  civil
        war.  He notes the arrest of a group of  Jaffna  students  who,  in
        reliance on the LLRC recommendations, sought to celebrate  Martyrs'
        Day and were arrested and sent for rehabilitation.

    15. In his report, Mr Punethanayagam gave evidence from his own  client
        database in relation to the  effect  of  bribery  as  a  method  of
        release from detention or to enable a person to leave the  country.
        Bribery and corruption is pervasive, especially among the  security
        forces, and well documented:

              "26.     ...The paramilitary groups,  working  alongside  the
              SLA, assist the escape of detainees in order to extort money.
              In my practice, I have come across several  cases  where  the
              families use bribery as a last resort to secure  the  release
              of a detainee with the assistance of members of the  security
              forces or paramilitary groups.

              27. The bribery is very common in the IDP camps  as  well  as
              the detention centers from which even known LTTE leaders have
              managed to escape on payment of bribes. Hence  it  cannot  be
              argued that only people of low interest  to  the  authorities
              are able to secure their  release  through  a  bribe.  In  my
              opinion, it is  plausible  that  the  detainee  was  released
              following the payment of a  bribe,  even  if  of  significant
              adverse interest to the authorities. It is unlikely that  the
              person who accepts the  bribe  would  access  the  detainee's
              record and change them as released or no longer wanted. Hence
              such  cases  would  normally  be  recorded  as  escaped  from
              detention in the database  of  the  Police.  Subsequently  an
              absconder action will be commenced and the detainee's details
              would be passed to the National Intelligence Bureau.

              28. It is possible to leave the country  using  bribery  with
              the help of an agent. The security officers  and  immigration
              officers at the international airport are no exception to the
              widespread bribery and corruption in Sri Lanka. It is  always
              possible for a person to use  influence  or  bribery  to  get
              through  the  airport  without  being  detained  as  an  LTTE
              suspect. I have been contacted by  approximately  30  clients
              who managed to flee the country via the international airport
              whilst in the adverse  interest  of  the  authorities  and  I
              provided evidence in their asylum cases in  the  UK,  Canada,
              France, Norway and Australia. Therefore leaving  through  the
              airport either with his/her own passport  or  false  identity
              does not necessarily indicate a lack of interest on the  part
              of the authorities."

    16. The reference to the actions of the person obtaining the release of
        a detainee is speculation.  The witness does not  suggest  that  he
        has any direct knowledge on that point. He is however in a position
        to confirm that approximately 30 of his 3000 clients left Sri Lanka
        while of interest using bribery:  unfortunately, he  does  not  say
        when this was in relation to the end of the civil war.

    17. The next passage relates to risk to the judiciary. The report deals
        with the impeachment of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake and her
        treatment by the  Parliamentary  Select  Committee  (PSC)  in  that
        context. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka held that the PSC  did  not
        have the power to impeach the Chief Justice.  The Chief Justice was
        removed from office, and  the  President  responded  by  appointing
        Mohan Peiris in her stead.  The witness commented:

           "However, by over passing these Judicial orders the  appointment
           of the new Chief  Justice  is  clear  evidence  as  to  how  the
           independence  of  the  Judiciary  has  been  infringed  by   the
           politicians. If this can happen to the Chief  of  the  Judiciary
           what could be the state of a normal citizen?"

  18. The threat to judicial independence is a matter of deep concern for Mr
      Punethanayagam as a practitioner.

Dr Suthaharan Nadarajah

  19. Dr Nadarajah is a lecturer at the Centre for International Studies and
      Diplomacy (CISD), School  of  Oriental  and  African  Studies  (SOAS),
      University of London. He holds an  MA  in  International  Studies  and
      Diplomacy.  He  is  currently  writing   a   book   on   international
      interventions for security and peace in Sri Lanka since 2000. Much  of
      his research and several publications  address  the  Tamil  diaspora's
      changing  relations  over  the  past  decade  with  the  international
      community, the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE.

  20.  In  2012  Dr  Nadarajah  briefed  the  United  Kingdom   government's
      Independent  Reviewer  on  Terrorism  Legislation  on  the  impact  of
      terrorism proscriptions on diaspora  political  activities  and  civil
      liberties.

  21. Dr Nadarajah gave both written and oral testimony to the Tribunal.  In
      answer to a number of specific questions posed of him, Dr  Nadarajah's
      undated report contained the following information.

  22. Since the civil war's end in May 2009, the  worldwide  Tamil  diaspora
      had become increasingly politically active.  Diaspora activities  were
      qualitatively different and of  a  significantly  greater  scale  than
      during the civil war. Since 2009 Tamil  diaspora  activities  had  two
      strands, continuing to  promote  Tamil  self-determination,  but  also
      campaigning actively for investigation and accountability for the 2009
      war crimes and/or crimes against humanity at the end of the civil war.
       The Tamil diaspora in London was responsible for staging some of  the
      most dramatic large-scale  protests  of  the  worldwide  diaspora  and
      London was perceived as a  focus  of  diaspora  activities.  The  most
      prominent youth grouping was the Tamil Youth Organisation,  which  has
      chapters in several diaspora centres, including the United Kingdom.

  23. There was growing pressure from leading western states, UN bodies  and
      international rights groups  for  an  independent  investigation  into
      accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in
      2009. The Sri Lankan authorities were perturbed and disquieted by  the
      successful interactions between the Tamil diaspora, western states and
      international NGOs. The diaspora in London have  staged  some  of  the
      most dramatic large scale protests of any diaspora.

  24. The Sri Lankan authorities' attitude to the Tamil diaspora in  western
      states had become one of hostility and suspicion.   The  diaspora  was
      considered to be plotting for LTTE resurgence within Sri Lanka and the
      GOSL regarded  diaspora  activities  as  a  threat  not  just  to  the
      Rajapaksa government but to the Sri Lankan state.  The driver for this
      was twofold; first,  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  blamed  the  Tamil
      diaspora's activities in the West for increasingly critical  attitudes
      to the  Sri  Lankan  government  among  the  international  community,
      including the United  Nations;  second,  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
      believed the Tamil diaspora to be supporting  and  collaborating  with
      opposition political parties  and  civil  society  groups  within  Sri
      Lanka.  The diaspora was  also  perceived  as  hosting  potential  war
      crimes witnesses and providing an opportunity for pan-Tamil  political
      coordination outwith the influence of the Sri Lankan authorities.

  25. The Sri Lankan authorities were concerned to  monitor,  interrupt  and
      prevent  connections  between  Tamils  in  the  Northern  and  Eastern
      Provinces within Sri Lanka and  diaspora  activists  worldwide.   Some
      Tamil expatriates worked with the Sri Lankan authorities, reporting on
      diaspora activities and identifying activists among the diaspora.

  26. Dr Nadarajah's research had not been directed towards establishing the
      attitude of the Sri Lankan authorities  to  returned  asylum  seekers.
      The Sri Lankan authorities' basic position  was  that  asylum  seekers
      were economic migrants.  His  opinion  was  that  returnees  would  be
      treated with hostility and  suspicion  because  the  act  of  claiming
      asylum would be seen as a criticism of the Sri Lankan authorities, and
      such  individuals  gave  the  international  community  insights  into
      practices in Sri Lanka that the authorities had made great efforts  to
      protect from international scrutiny.

  27. On 3 December 2012 in an open letter  to  the  Australian  authorities
      supporting an injunction application against deportation  made  by  50
      Australian asylum seekers, the Bishop of Mannar,  Dr  Rayappu  Joseph,
      had appealed to the Australian authorities to stop deportation of  Sri
      Lankan Tamils. Excerpts of his letter had been published in the Sydney
      Herald and the Age, both mainstream Australian publications.

           "...It is  common  knowledge  that  those  deported  back  after
           seeking political asylum abroad are left to  live  in  fear  and
           fright due to being considered traitors by  the  Government  and
           its armed Forces. Some  of  them  are  being  forced  to  become
           informants creating tension in the  communities.  They  all  are
           meted   out   with    restrictions,    threats,    intimidation,
           questionings, surveillance and other forms  of  harassments  and
           discrimination by the  Military,  Police  and  the  intelligence
           officers. ...Thus, it is my considered opinion that it is highly
           dangerous for the asylum seekers from the North and East of  Sri
           Lanka in  Australia  to  be  sent  back  to  Sri  Lanka  in  the
           prevailing political situation in our regions. ..."[34]

      Since publishing this appeal, and publicly embarrassing the GOSL,  the
      Bishop had been questioned three times by the security forces.

  28. The build-up of military might in the Northern and  Eastern  Provinces
      was disproportionate to the actual risk of resurgence by  the  Tigers.
      President Rajapaksa had sought to justify military deployment on  such
      a scale as necessary for development work  in  Tamil  areas,  but  any
      development was of only minimal benefit to the Tamils. There  had  not
      been a single attack by the LTTE since May 2009. The Sri  Lankan  army
      still maintains 16 out of its  19  divisions  in  the  Tamil-dominated
      regions, the number of troops stationed  there  being  more  than  the
      number in the entire British Army. The military  continued  to  occupy
      private lands taken during the civil war.   Designated  High  Security
      Zones (HSZs) had prevented the resettlement of 'ten of  thousands'  of
      Tamils.

  29. Adverse treatment of Tamils by the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  was  not
      likely to be reported in the mainstream Sri Lankan media.  There  were
      four main reasons for this:  self-censorship, particularly amongst the
      Tamil  media,  for  fear  of   reprisals   against   journalists   and
      publications; interference in media content by media proprietors;  non
      state media's dependence on government advertising as  its  source  of
      revenue; and nationalist sentiments in the Sinhalese media, encouraged
      by  incentives  and  State  coercion.   The  Sri  Lankan   authorities
      restricted information flow  via  the  internet  and  mobile  devices,
      arbitrarily blocking websites and monitoring telephone and  electronic
      communications.

  30. The consequences for those who  were,  or  were  suspected  of  being,
      witnesses to war crimes committed by  the  Sri  Lankan  military  were
      likely to be very severe and such persons faced considerable risk.  No
      single issue had drawn more effort by the Sri Lankan authorities since
      the civil war's end in  May  2009  than  thwarting  the  international
      campaign for an independent investigation into war crimes  and  crimes
      against humanity committed during the final conflict.

  31. There was now no systematic collation of either the number or  details
      of human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. The  members  of  the  Sri  Lanka
      Human Rights Commission were Presidential appointees.   After  a  long
      post-2009  hiatus  when  the  appointments  of  the  previous  members
      expired, in  February  2011  President  Rajapaksa  had  appointed  new
      members to the Commission.  Dr Nadarajah considered  the  impartiality
      of the 2011-appointed Commission to be 'demonstrably suspect'.

  32. In his  oral  evidence,  in  answer  to  supplementary  questions,  Dr
      Nadarajah expanded his evidence-in-chief.  He  explained  that  'Pongu
      Thamil' meant 'Tamil Upsurge' or 'Tamil Uprising', reflecting a series
      of uprisings by Sri Lankan Tamils  across  the  Northern  and  Eastern
      Provinces, in late 1999 and during the peace process era.  The purpose
      of the uprisings was to advocate Tamil self-determination; it had been
      a kind of popular resistance  movement  similar  to  the  intifada  in
      Palestine.  It was a broad social movement by Tamil activists  and  in
      particular, student activists.  The GOSL regarded them as Tigers and a
      significant number of those involved in  that  movement,  particularly
      students, had been liquidated  in  "white  van"  killings  during  the
      shadow war between 2005-2007.

  33. The December 2012 arrest of students in Jaffna was connected to  Pongu
      Thamil; the LTTE's junior cadres came out  of  student  activism,  and
      student activism in Jaffna University was seen  as  the  beginning  of
      trouble, with the university being regarded as  a  bellwether  of  how
      things were going.

  34. In May 2009, it had become very clear that the army was likely to  win
      the civil war.  There was already  a  history  of  disappearances  and
      silent protests; there had been  sit-down  protests  in  Churches  and
      universities, intended as an act of solidarity with the people of  the
      Vanni, and to send a message to  the  world  outside  and  spark  mass
      protests across the worldwide diaspora.

  35. The LTTE was the apex organisation of Tamil politics and  the  Upsurge
      consisted of episodic protests, without any overarching  organisation,
      coalescing into a large movement, a 'Blackberry revolution' similar to
      the Arab spring, in London and Toronto in  particular.   The  movement
      was from the ground up, not the top down.   Nobody  would  be  foolish
      enough now to organise a new  Pongu  Thamil;  within  Sri  Lanka,  the
      combination of terror and targeted violence meant that  people  simply
      did  not  show  up  for  demonstrations  and  even  where  spontaneous
      demonstrations occurred, the leaders were spoken to by the Sri  Lankan
      authorities afterwards.  The channel for protest  now  was  petitions,
      which acted as a virtual Pongu Thamil,  but  people  did  occasionally
      take to the streets to mark particular occasions.

  36.  The  other  date  of  importance  was  Mahaveera,  'Heroes  Day'   or
      'Remembrance Day', when Tamils commemorated  murdered  LTTE  fighters,
      but it was also a broader social commemoration for families  of  those
      who had lost cadres or students in the  fighting.   The  Tamil  nation
      comes together for Mahaveera; even those who did not support the armed
      struggle would show up for that.  LTTE dead were buried, not cremated,
      in mass heroes' graves, and their families were respected  for  having
      sacrificed for the struggle.  The  Sri  Lankan  authorities  perceived
      martyr families with resentment and suspicion.  A  significant  number
      of LTTE cadres had died in the last stage  of  the  civil  war;  their
      families did not know where their children were, only  that  they  had
      participated  in  activities  against  the  Sri  Lankan  state.   Such
      families had a social value as people who had lost  a  child  for  the
      cause.

  37. Heroes' Day had been celebrated on May 18 every year since the end  of
      the civil war; large numbers of Tamils had been put into a  particular
      space and annihilated, to 'teach them a lesson', and Mahaveera  was  a
      day  of  mourning  and  defiance.    In  most  countries,  there  were
      political rallies on that day; in the United Kingdom,  in  particular,
      it was held in Trafalgar Square, marking that set  of  deaths  at  the
      Mullaitivu beach.

  38. In cross-examination, Dr Nadarajah clarified that  the  demonstrations
      by the Jaffna students  in  December  2012  were  not  'Pongu  Thamil'
      demonstrations; November 27 was Heroes Day in 2012 and there had  been
      a candlelit vigil by several dozen students at Jaffna University.  The
      vigil had been supported by the  wider  community.  The  military  had
      responded with arrests and violence.  It was  the  military  that  had
      escalated the remembrance into conflict.

  39. Hundreds of people had demonstrated, according to  the  media  reports
      and his own investigation. A large number of  students  were  arrested
      and subsequently released.  Tear gas was used  and  there  were  large
      numbers of security forces present.  Those not released were  detained
      under the PTA and then transferred to other parts of the country.

  40. Jaffna University was shut  down  after  the  arrests;  120  lecturers
      signed a petition for the students to be released.  There was a stand-
      off between the authorities and the students; some had been  released,
      but the remainder were described by the authorities as LTTE detainees.
        Other  students  were  refusing  to  return  to  classes  until  the
      authorities released their colleagues from detention.

  41. Arresting a few of the students had a chilling effect;  parents  would
      be telling their children  not  to  continue  with  the  protests.  Dr
      Nadarajah had not asked what percentage of the students were  held  or
      released;  he had seen no report of those  who  were  released  having
      been mistreated or tortured in detention.  The Tribunal should bear in
      mind that two junior staff of the BHC had been in Jaffna at the  time;
      in  the  past,  arrested  students  had  been  beaten,  tortured,  and
      occasionally, produced in court still bleeding.  The GOSL's focus  was
      on 'defeating  the  diaspora'  in  the  United  Kingdom,  whereas  the
      diaspora wanted to hold the GOSL to account.  Within  Sri  Lanka,  the
      GOSL had wide-ranging social power.   The  diaspora  was  a  group  of
      people, and a place, from which its policies could be resisted.    The
      LTTE had been the original obstacle for the GOSL but that task had now
      been taken up by the diaspora, which had brought the movement  outside
      Sri Lanka.    The diaspora had been active at the CHOGM  in  Perth  in
      2011 and a new resolution was being  tabled  for  the  March  2013  UN
      meeting.

  42. If the GOSL could demonstrate the defeat of the diaspora,  that  would
      benefit the government.  The GOSL was working hard to conceal  aspects
      of its internal difficulties at home in Sri Lanka.

  43. Large numbers of Tamils were returning.  Those with British  passports
      were in a better position with possible oversight of what happened  to
      them from the British  government.   Sri  Lankan  nationals  returning
      would have more difficulty, since the Sri Lankan state  had  authority
      over them.  The diaspora was seen as a group of people undermining and
      harming the GOSL in a number of ways:  the GOSL's invitation to Tamils
      to return and rebuild Sri Lanka was, by and large, simply rhetoric for
      the international community and hard to take  seriously.   People  had
      responded, and discovered the  reality  of  the  invitation.   He  did
      realise that the  GOSL's  position  was  apparently  contradictory  in
      relation to his account.

  44. Mr Hall asked Dr Nadarajah to comment on his position that if the GOSL
      mistreated returning Tamils, they would be deterred  from  seeking  to
      return or be unhappy with their return.  Dr Nadarajah replied that any
      such mis-treatment would be in addition to Tamils' knowledge that they
      were deeply  unpopular  with  the  authorities.   The  appellants  had
      produced evidence of students who returned voluntarily in 2011 to  Sri
      Lanka, where they were picked up and tortured  but  were  nevertheless
      able to leave again for the United Kingdom.  People  left  even  after
      arrest and torture; the Sri Lankan system was riddled with  corruption
      and even in severe cases, a sufficient bribe could enable  an  escape.
      There was no contradiction between the authorities torturing a  person
      in detention, and then taking a bribe to enable them to leave.

  45. Other policies of the GOSL would also upset the diaspora; the GOSL was
      trying to thwart accountability  in  the  face  of  the  international
      community.   The Sri Lankan authorities were keen to deny any evidence
      which could be used in a war crimes trial.  There was a risk to people
      who were even suspected of having evidence of  war  crimes,  who  were
      present in Sri Lanka between January and May 2009.  There  were  other
      incidents too, such as the execution of five  students  in  2007  (the
      Trincomalee Five), and the killing of 16 international aid workers  in
      2006, which was the second largest such incident in the  world,  after
      the bombing of the UN compound in Baghdad.  If  there  were  to  be  a
      successful prosecution, then more claims would emerge.

  46. Two sets of proceedings had been issued  in  the  United  States,  the
      first relating to the Trincomalee Five, filed in 2009, he thought.   A
      journalist who took photographs of that incident  had  been  executed.
      Numerous further incidents were recorded in local  Sri  Lankan  press.
      There had been a period during the peace process  in  Sri  Lanka  when
      things seemed to be easing up;   cease-fire  monitors  from  2002  had
      documented extensive claims, which were not random accusations and for
      which  there  probably  existed  supporting  material.   Much  of  the
      commentary existed in 'alternative media' on websites run from abroad,
      or from Colombo until they were shut down.  The social media  was  now
      used more; stories often broke on twitter or Facebook and  then  moved
      to the Tamil expatriate websites.

  47. When asked how likely it was that news of mis-treatment of individuals
      returned on charter flights would get out, Dr Nadarajah  said  it  was
      hard to say.  Some things were never  reported,  others  emerged  very
      quickly.    One could not say that  nothing  happened  simply  because
      nothing was reported. Frequently, people  who  had  been  arrested  or
      tortured, and their family members, were warned not  to  discuss  what
      happened.  Mobile phones and the internet were rare  in  the  Northern
      and Eastern Provinces but readily  available,  at  a  high  price,  in
      Colombo.  He  considered  it  likely  that  the  internet  and  mobile
      providers had to keep in the GOSL's 'good books'.

  48. The Tamil population of Sri Lanka should be  regarded  as  much  lower
      than the 3 million it had been; many of those people were now  in  the
      diaspora and the figure was based on 20 year old text books.   It  was
      also affected by the movement of Sinhalese into  Tamil  areas  in  the
      Northern and Eastern Provinces.

  49. In the United Kingdom, Dr Nadarajah understood that there were about a
      quarter of a million Tamils, as well as second-generation  Tamils  who
      might not so  describe  themselves;   in  Canada,  about  300,000;  in
      Switzerland, and in France, about 40-50,000 each; in Australia, and in
      Italy, 80,000 each; and in Norway, 15-20,000.  Numbers in Tamil  Nadu,
      Malaysia and Singapore were hard to  calculate.   There  were  100,000
      registered Tamil refugees in camps in Tamil Nadu but no  real  numbers
      for those who travelled back and forth  between  Tamil  Nadu  and  Sri
      Lanka.  These were not his own figures, but those of others.

  50. The Tamils diaspora in Britain was now the most politically active; in
      the last three years, it had gone from 'way behind' and much more  low
      key to become the most active now.  There  had  been  an  eruption  of
      young activism in the United Kingdom; such activism  was  particularly
      prominent in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Europe generally, but the
      major centre of international Tamil affairs  now  was  London.   There
      were a large number of universities with Tamil societies, and  English
      was the language of international affairs.

  51. In answer to questions from the Tribunal, Dr Nadarajah  said  that  he
      had not travelled to Sri Lanka since 2003, but that he had  researched
      the position in Sri Lanka since that date; his  research  was  carried
      out by Skype or telephone or when people travelled out of  Sri  Lanka.
      A large number of people came to the United Kingdom, sooner or  later.
      He sat by, like a fisherman, and people like journalists and so  forth
      would talk to him, secure in the knowledge of what use he  would  make
      of what they said.

  52. There was a perception that Skype was more secure than  the  internet,
      which was subject to arbitrary blocking of websites and  known  to  be
      under surveillance.  The authorities relied on the chilling effect  of
      people knowing that there was oversight  of  their  conversations  and
      arbitrary restriction.  He had seen posts from people who  might  have
      more protection.   When using Hotmail or Gmail,  people  took  it  for
      granted that the security forces had access even if those posting were
      not in Sri Lanka.  People had become very careful with their  phrasing
      and there was a feeling of covert menace. Dr Nadarajah was disciplined
      in what he wrote, and careful what he asked; a number of the people he
      had spoken to had been murdered.  People in Sri Lanka had  warned  him
      not to write to particular addresses, and in those  cases,  he  waited
      for his correspondents to get in touch, perhaps from a  'clean'  email
      address.

  53. In response to resumed cross-examination from Mr  Hall,  Dr  Nadarajah
      said that his understanding was that, for Hotmail, the computer  could
      always be traced.  For some people, he maintained  a  dedicated  email
      address just for that correspondence.   There were internet  cafes  in
      Jaffna and in Colombo.

  54. He had been told by a very senior defence correspondent in  Sri  Lanka
      at  the  end  of  the  1990s  that  the  GOSL  was  about  to  upgrade
      surveillance capability  with  the  help  of  United  States  military
      intelligence.  The American Center in Colombo had been  opened  by  an
      important local Sri Lankan military commander.

  55. People  accepted  the  surveillance;  those  who  used  mobile  phones
      relatively freely were among the group of high profile Tamils whom the
      international diplomatic corps met when going to  Jaffna,  which  gave
      them a measure of protection.

  56. There was no re-examination.

                                 APPENDIX L

                                PRESS REPORTS

1. The 'Background Bundles' before us  contained  approximately  400  folios
   under the heading 'News Articles'; dating from late 2011 to  early  2013.
   The articles relied upon are drawn from a variety of  sources,  including
   newspapers published  in  Sri  Lanka  and  abroad,  Yahoo  News,  Amnesty
   International Urgent Action  papers,  and  articles  published  by  Human
   Rights Asia, the Asian Human Rights Commission and The Economist.

2. The articles from 2013 cover a broad range of topics. Yahoo News  reports
   on demonstrations in Colombo in January 2013 against  the  passing  of  a
   legislation extending, to 48 hours, the time  police  can  hold  suspects
   without a warrant. A report in the Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka) of  the  same
   month notes that almost 1000 Sri Lankans had  returned  to  Colombo  from
   Australia since August 2012, 213 of those returns being voluntary. 19 Sri
   Lankan nationals were returned by Australia on 17 January 2013. A further
   article published by the UN news site ReliefWeb[35] states that over 1200
   persons returned from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in 2012.

3. Other articles from  2013  claim  that  thousands  of  people  are  still
   awaiting return to their homes in northern of Sri Lanka; that  44  of  47
   people  arrested  in  Jaffna  and  Kilinochchi  were  detained  in  Boosa
   detention facility; and that, according to both the  Lanka  News  Web[36]
   site and the Sydney Morning  Herald,  Sri  Lankan  government  operatives
   intimidated peaceful demonstrators against the Sri Lanka cricket team, in
   Australia, these protests having been both filmed and photographed. On  a
   related topic the UK based Guardian newspaper reported on the Sri  Lankan
   President's cancellation of his key note speech in the City of London  in
   June 2012 as a consequence of the large scale demonstrations in London by
   Tamil rights groups

4. As to the news articles from 2012; in March 2012 BBC  news  reported  the
   United National Party as stating that the  situation  in  Sri  Lanka  was
   deteriorating on a daily basis and an unnamed Senior  Police  Officer  as
   stating that there are 'plenty of white vans in Sri Lanka'.

5. The Economist reported in October 2012, along with a numerous other  news
   agencies, that the Secretary of the Judicial Services Commission had been
   seriously assaulted in Sri Lanka shortly after issuing  a  press  release
   claiming that efforts were being made by the  Sri  Lankan  government  to
   destroy the independence of the judiciary. Numerous later  reports  relay
   information relating to the impeachment of the Sri Lankan Chief  Justice,
   generally expressing opinion as to the politically  motivated  nature  of
   the impeachment.

6. A number of articles refer to the Sri Lankan government's  occupation  of
   the Northern Province. India's Economic and Political Weekly analysed the
   reasons and intensity of military investment in the Northern Province  as
   follows:

      "The Northern Province as a whole and  the  Vanni  in  particular  are
      amongst the least densely populated regions of Sri Lanka. According to
      Department of Census and statistics estimates, the population  of  the
      Northern Province in 2011 was 9,97,754. It implies that  a  population
      roughly half the size of Colombo district or equivalent  to  a  medium
      sized Indian city is effectively under the control of  the  staggering
      number of 15 army divisions in addition to other  military  units  and
      forces. ...


      Given that 75% of the army's divisions are stationed in  the  Northern
      Province, in addition to other formations  such  as  task  forces  and
      independent brigades and regimental units, it is not  unreasonable  to
      assume that at least 60% of  the  army,  i  e,  approximately  180,000
      personnel, are stationed across the Northern Province.


      However one must add to this 180,000, the share of personnel from  the
      navy, the air  force,  civil  defence  forces,  intelligence  and  the
      police, including the special task force, etc, based in  the  Northern
      Province. Assuming that the combined  presence  of  all  these  latter
      entities accounts for 10% of the army's  strength  (18,000),  again  a
      very conservative estimate, this makes for a total of 198,000 security
      personnel in the province. This amounts  to  a  ratio  of  1  security
      personnel for every 5.04 civilians in the Northern Province or a force
      density  of  around  198.4  security  personnel  per  1,000   civilian
      population.


      Troop Density: Some Comparisons and Context


      It is, however, important to put this figure (a force density of  198:
      1,000) in context, to underline its  unprecedented  nature.  A  recent
      historical analysis undertaken by the Institute  of  Defense  Analyses
      (IDA), for the US Department  of  Defense,  of  41  counter-insurgency
      operations worldwide suggested that a  density  of  40-50  troops  per
      thousand population (or 1  security  personnel  for  20-25  civilians)
      might be required for reasonably high confidence (>80%) of operational
      success (Kneece 2010). Note that this recommendation is for an  active
      theatre of operations and not for a situation post  the  cessation  of
      hostilities. A 2012 memorandum of  the  US  Department  of  the  Army,
      building on the IDA study, notes that the force  density  in  Iraq  in
      2007 (the time of the "surge") was around 20 per  thousand  civilians.
      According to a Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) of the UK Ministry  of
      Defence, in the mid-1970s the force density in Northern Ireland was 23
      security personnel per 1,000 population. Goode (2009-10: 46) estimates
      that  counter-insurgency  security  forces  under  French  command  in
      Algeria peaked at nearly 60 per 1,000  residents  while  the  Russians
      committed more than 150 soldiers per 1,000 civilians  in  Chechnya  in
      2003, in the course of the  bloody  second  Chechnyan  war.  A  recent
      estimate of Jammu and Kashmir in India, widely considered amongst  the
      most militarised regions in the world,  put  the  number  of  security
      forces at 5,00,000 for a population of  13  million  or  one  security
      personnel for every 26 civilians.


      By comparison, there is little doubt that the extent of  the  military
      presence in the Northern Province is extraordinarily high,  especially
      given the fact that the civil war itself came to an  end  three  years
      ago. Interestingly, the UK JDP referred to above,  notes  that  during
      operations against the LTTE in 2008, the force density was already  as
      high as 60 security personnel per 1,000  civilian  population  but  as
      pointed out the military expanded very rapidly right up  to  May  2009
      and beyond with most of these  personnel  being  committed  up  north,
      which is still the case. Moreover, Sri Lankan forces gained ground and
      moved deeper into the Vanni, which has very low population  densities.
      Hence, the estimate of a force density of 198: 1,000 or a ratio  of  1
      security personnel for around every five civilians in the north  still
      appears to hold good. In fact, even if one were to cut  that  estimate
      by a full 50%, it yields a force density of 99 per 1,000 civilians  or
      1 security personnel for nearly every 10  civilians,  which  is  still
      extra�ordinarily  high,  in  comparison  to  many  ongoing  and   past
      conflicts (including under some repressive colonial occupations),  let
      alone three years after the civil war.


      So why is there is such a heavy military presence in the North?  There
      are at least three reasons for a continued presence of some  level  of
      security forces. First, the north was heavily militarised by the  LTTE
      and the civil war left behind a heavy  concentration  of  weapons  and
      stray and unexploded ordinance (UXO), while undetected mines  in  some
      areas still present a danger. However, it is important to note that in
      addition to the Sri Lanka  Army's  own  Humanitarian  De-mining  Unit,
      there at least eight  other  organisations  engaged  in  demining  and
      clearance of UXO, which are proceeding apace although a mine-free  Sri
      Lanka is still a few years away (Abhayagunawardena 2011).  It  is  far
      from evident that demining  and  UXO  clearance  tasks  are  a  hugely
      significantly reason for such high levels of military presence  across
      the north as many areas have in fact been already cleared.


      Second, the fragility of  the  post-war  environment  also  demands  a
      stabilising security presence. It should not  be  forgotten  that  the
      reign of the LTTE, which ran most of the north for over  two  decades,
      was itself brutal and  arbitrary,  undoubtedly  leaving  fissures  and
      cracks in the Tamil society. Then there are the  insecurities  of  the
      returning  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  from   the   Muslim
      community - forcibly evicted by the LTTE, with  48-hour  notice,  from
      the Vanni more than 20 years ago - who  are  still  only  just  making
      their way back, only to find in some cases that the lands  and  houses
      they were forced to leave behind have long been in the  possession  of
      others. As much as these  are  reasonable  arguments  for  a  security
      presence, in the democratic world at least, providing such a sense  of
      security, ensuring the rule of law and the sort of stability needed in
      the Northern Province would actually  be  a  civil  policing  function
      rather than a military call of duty. Indeed civil policing is  central
      to ensuring that conditions, which may encourage any sort of organised
      violence do not recur. It is also worth noting here though that  there
      has been little evidence of any regrouping, let alone  resurgence,  of
      the LTTE or its supporters."

7. The Nation newspaper reported in  May  2012  on  a  speech  by  President
   Rajapaksa declaring that there would be no removal of the military  camps
   from the Northern Province of Sri Lanka as to do so would allow Eelamists
   to achieve their aim, albeit by a different method to that  used  by  the
   LTTE. Various articles, including from the BBC and Yahoo  News,  identify
   the reason behind the militarisation of the Northern Province as being  a
   fear by the Sri Lankan authorities of a  resurgence  of  the  LTTE,  both
   within and outside Sri Lanka. TamilNet reports that in October  2012  the
   Sri Lankan Defence Ministry sought a 26% increase in its budget,  to  290
   billion rupees.

8. In April 2012 the Sri Lanka  Daily  Mirror  reported  that  after  having
   received information from a detained LTTE member, security forces engaged
   search operations in the Eastern province of Sri Lanka, in order to  find
   LTTE cadres whom it was suspected had returned from  India.  In  November
   2012 'Ceylon Today' reported that the TID launched investigations seeking
   identify those who had been responsible for hoisting LTTE  flags  in  the
   Northern and Eastern provinces to mark Prabakharan's birth. A  number  of
   the news articles also report information on the  abduction,  arrest  and
   detention, of  Sri  Lankan  national  Tamils,  including  the  arrest  in
   December 2012 of 13 students of the University of Jaffna, 6 of whom  were
   said  to  have  been  tortured  and   thereafter   sent   for   "military
   rehabilitation".

9. Both TamilNet and the Sri Lankan Guardian report on the detention in  Sri
   Lanka of British Citizens of Tamil origin, the  former  referring  to  an
   arrest, torture and interrogation about diaspora activities, of a British
   male, upon his arrival in Sri Lanka in October 2012; the latter reporting
   of the arrest of a 51 year British female,  of  Tamil  origin,  upon  her
   attempted exit from Sri Lanka. The same article further  reports  of  the
   British  High  Commission's  role  in  trying  to  obtain  her   release.
   Arithu.com reported that a male French Tamil had been arrested in  Jaffna
   in August 2012 for having an LTTE tattoo on his arm.

10. TamilNet and the Asian Human Rights Commission report on  abductions  in
   Colombo and observe the lack of political will to stop them;  the  latter
   organisation claiming, in April 2012, that such abductions formed a  part
   of the approved counter insurgency strategy of the Sri Lankan government.

11.  The  Guardian  reported  on  the  Committee  for  the   Protection   of
   Journalists call to the Sri Lankan government to stop its intimidation of
   journalists. The UN Committee Against Torture (UNCAT)  also  detailed  at
   some length, in its report of November 2011, allegations of intimidation,
   harassment, physical attacks and politically  motivated  charges  against
   independent  journalists,  human  rights  defenders,  lawyers  and  civil
   society actors.
