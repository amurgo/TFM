                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Herwald promulgated on 22 October 2014  which  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on 14 November 1983 and is  a  national  of  Sri
    Lanka.

 4. On 6 March 2014 the Appellant applied for leave to remain as a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points Based System.

 5. On  3  July  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application and made directions for her removal under section 47 of the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The refusal letter gave a
    number of reasons:

 6. Under the heading  of  Non  Points  Scoring  Reasons  for  Refusal  the
    Respondent did not accept that  the  Appellant  genuinely  had  �50,000
    available  for  investment;  that  there  were   concerns   about   the
    credibility of the contracts the Appellant had produced as evidence  of
    the establishment of his business; the Appellant's previous educational
    and business experience did not show evidence of working in  the  field
    of her proposed business. The Respondent was not satisfied on the basis
    of the evidence produced that the Appellant was a genuine  entrepreneur
    who intended to run  a  genuine  business.  Under  Points  Scoring  the
    Respondent therefore did not award any of the points claimed for funds.



The Judge's Decision

 7. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Herwald  ("the  Judge")  dismissed  the   appeal   against   the
    Respondent's decision. The Judge found :

      a) The Appellant had to show that she genuinely intended and was  able
         to establish a business within the next 6 months and that the money
         for it was genuinely available.

      b) Taking into account hose factors which he was entitled to  consider
         under 245DD(i) he was not satisfied that the Appellant was able  to
         establish the business within the next 6 months.

      c) In relation to the contracts produced by the Appellant he  accepted
         that Miss Kahn had a company but found the level of  work  done  by
         the Appellant for the company was of some concern and she  was  not
         in court to provide evidence in support of the Appellant's claim.

      d) The other contract in relation to Mr Ahmad for whom  the  Appellant
         was to provide a service engine optimisation  strategy.  The  Judge
         noted that the company did not have a website at the  time  of  the
         contract the Respondent were entitled to doubt the  genuine  nature
         of the contract. Mr Ahamd was not at court to be cross examined.

      e) The other contracts post dated the application.

      f) The Judge did not find it  credible  that  working  full  time  the
         Appellant could carry out the business plan that she had produced.

      g)  All  of  the  Appellant's  previous   experience   had   been   in
         international development.

      h) The Judge did not find the offer  of  �50,000  from  a  friend  was
         credible or genuine.

 8. Grounds of appeal were lodged First-tier Tribunal Judge R  A  Cox  gave
    permission to appeal stating:

    "On the  face  of  things  the  Judge  appears  to  have  undertaken  a
    thoroughgoing analysis of the case and reached a  reasoned  conclusion.
    However I am just persuaded that the grounds have arguable merit."

 9. At the hearing I heard submissions  from  Mr  Khan  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that enlarged on the grounds of appeal dated 31 October  2014
    and his skeleton argument which he relied on:

      a) The business in issue was embryonic and the Appellant had 6  months
         to develope it but the judge erred in evaluating it  on  the  basis
         that it was fully functional.

      b) The Judges comment at paragraph 12 (f) in relation to a matter that
         was not in dispute suggests that the  judge  did  not  give  proper
         weight to the evidence before him.

      c) The Appellant did have relevant experience for the services she was
         offering and did have experience in web development.

      d) The suggestion that the Appellant should evidence  that  her  blogs
         had benefited Ms Khans business was unfair as that information  was
         in the hands of her customer.

      e) It was unfair to suggest that the blog was poorly written the Judge
         was merely showing his  own  lack  of  understanding  of  technical
         language.

10. On behalf of the Respondent  Ms Johnstone submitted that :

      a) She relied on the Rule 24 notice served by the Respondent.

      b) The Appellant was simply attempting to reargue the case.

      c) The Upper tribunal was not there to  review  the  judge's  findings
         unless the findings were irrational or perverse.

      d) The Judge made clear findings about why he did not find  the  offer
         of funding was credible or genuinely available and  these  findings
         were open to him.

Legal Framework

11. In order for the application to be successful an applicants for a  Tier
    1 visa must satisfy the requirements of paragraph 254DD  (a)-(k)  which
    include what is referred to as the  non  points  scoring  part  of  the
    application where the Respondent assesses the genuineness and viability
    of the business proposals. The provisions at 245DD read:

         (h) Except where the applicant has, or was last granted, leave as a
         Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, a Businessperson or an Innovator and
         is being assessed under Table 5 of Appendix  A,  the  Secretary  of
         State must be satisfied that:

             (i) the applicant genuinely:

                  (1) intends and is able to establish, take over or  become
                  a director of one or more businesses in the UK within  the
                  next six months, or

                  (2) has established, taken over or become  a  director  of
                  one or more businesses in the UK and continues to  operate
                  that business or businesses; and

             (ii) the applicant  genuinely  intends  to  invest  the  money
             referred to in Table 4  of  Appendix  A  in  the  business  or
             businesses referred to in (i);

             (iii) the money referred to  in  Table  4  of  Appendix  A  is
             genuinely  available  to  the  applicant,  and   will   remain
             available to him until such  time  as  it  is  spent  for  the
             purposes of his business or businesses.

             (iv) that the applicant does not intend to take employment  in
             the United Kingdom other than under  the  terms  of  paragraph
             245DE.

         (i) In making the assessment in (h), the Secretary  of  State  will
         assess the balance of probabilities. The  Secretary  of  State  may
         take into account the following factors:

             (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;

             (ii) the viability and credibility of the source of the  money
             referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;

             (iii)  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the   applicant's
             business plans and market research into their chosen  business
             sector;

             (iv)  the  applicant's  previous  educational   and   business
             experience (or lack thereof);

             (v) the applicant's immigration history and previous  activity
             in the UK;

             (vi) where the applicant has already registered in the  UK  as
             self-employed or as the director of a business, and the nature
             of the business requires mandatory accreditation, registration
             and/or insurance,  whether  that  accreditation,  registration
             and/or insurance has been obtained; and

             (vii) any other relevant information.

         (j) The Secretary of State reserves the right to request additional
         information and evidence to support the assessment in (h),  and  to
         refuse the application  if  the  information  or  evidence  is  not
         provided. Any requested documents must be received by the Secretary
         of State at the address specified in the request within 28  working
         days of the date of the request.

         (k) If the Secretary of State is not satisfied with the genuineness
         of the application in relation to a points-scoring  requirement  in
         Appendix A, those points will not be awarded.

Finding on Material Error

12. Having heard those submissions I/we reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

13. I am satisfied that the Judge made clear throughout this  determination
    that he understood the issues under appeal  and  had  directed  himself
    appropriately as this was set out  at  paragraphs  2-3  and  summarised
    again at paragraph 16(a). He repeated that he understood  the  standard
    of proof was the balance of probabilities.

14. The Judge made clear that  he  understood  that  he  was  assessing  an
    'embryonic' business but he was  nevertheless  entitled  to  make  that
    assessment on the basis of the evidence provided at  the  date  of  the
    application.

15. The Appellant's claim was that she had  set  up  a  company  called  LJ
    Communications (Pvt) Limited and produced two contracts as evidence  of
    the genuine nature and  viability  of  her  company.  The  grounds  and
    skeleton argument suggest that the Judge did not assess  this  evidence
    fairly. I am satisfied that the detailed findings made by the Judge  at
    paragraphs 16(a)-(e) in relation to the genuine nature and viability of
    the business were ones that were open to him and he gave  detailed  and
    cogent reasoning for the conclusions that he arrived it.

16.  The Judge was entitled to comment adversely on the fact that given the
    burden of proof and the fact that the genuine nature of  the  contracts
    accompanying her application was put in issue  in  the  refusal  letter
    neither of the named individuals who had entered  into  contracts  with
    the Appellant had attended court in support of  her  claim  that  these
    were genuine business contracts; given that the Appellant claimed  that
    she was paid  to  produce  blogs  for  Ms  Khans  business  I  find  it
    reasonable that the Judge questioned what evidence  there  was  of  the
    benefit to Ms Khan of such blogs in terms of their financial impact  on
    her business as that is relevant to the credibility  of  the  contract;
    the Judge also found it was  not  credible  that  the  Appellant  would
    provide search engine optimisation strategy for a  Mr  Ahmad's  company
    when it did not even have a website or indeed a registered domain  name
    6 months after the contract was signed;  I  am  satisfied  that  having
    directed himself properly that this was an embryonic business the Judge
    was entitled to ask how when  she  was  working  full  time  she  could
    properly carried forward what she set  out  in  her  business  plan  or
    indeed carried out the market research  and  it  was  open  to  him  to
    conclude that even for an embryonic business he would have expected for
    it to be viable that it had progressed more (paragraph 16(j)

17. It is  suggested  that  the  Judge  assessed  her  previous  experience
    unfairly. Paragraph 10 of the grounds suggests that the Judge  was  not
    entitled to  find  'There  was  no  suggestion  that  she  had  studied
    computers or anything like that.' This was not a finding  made  by  the
    Judge but was part of a summary of the Appellant's claim  in  that  she
    confirmed  that  she  had  come  to  the  United   Kingdom   to   study
    international development management. The finding that the  Judge  made
    in relation to the relevance of the Appellant's past  experience  which
    he was entitled under the Rules to take into account was  at  paragraph
    16(k) under the heading of Findings that her educational experience was
    in the field of English and then international development not  in  web
    content development. This was a finding open to him.

18. The Judge's assessment of the genuine  availability  of  the  funds  is
    challenged in the grounds and the skeleton argument. The Judge  made  a
    number of detailed findings as to why he did  not  find  the  offer  of
    funding to be genuine at paragraphs 16(l) -(u): he found it  incredible
    that a friend of only 8 years (not 'a very long time' as  suggested  in
    the skeleton argument) would risk a quarter of her entire assets  given
    the careful plans she was making to retire in 11  years  and  where  no
    interest was to be paid; he was entitled to ask what she  would  do  if
    unable to repay the loan and when the Appellant gave evidence that  she
    would seek the help of her parents ask why they were not her first port
    of call; he was entitled to question why the friend had not seen her in
    the United Kingdom or sought to inspect her business; he  was  entitled
    to comment on the lack of any written  agreement  in  relation  to  the
    offer of funds or indeed any agreement as to terms. I am satisfied that
    it was open to the Judge to find  that  the  offer  of  funds  was  not
    genuine against these findings.

19. There are one or two unnecessary  comments  in  the  decision  such  as
    describing the business plan as 'magnificent' (16(j)) or the suggestion
    that the 'casual observer' might find the Tier 1  scheme  'bizarre  and
    odd' in not requiring the funds to be deposited in  a  bank  but  I  am
    satisfied that these in no way impacted on the conclusions drawn.

20. The challenges in the grounds are an attempt to  reargue  the  evidence
    that I am satisfied the Judge assessed in great detail  in  determining
    whether the Appellant's business was genuine and viable.

CONCLUSION

21. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

22. The appeal is dismissed.
