Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood
For the Respondents:   Mr A Khan, of Counsel and instructed by Messrs
                    Longfellow Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Napthine  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 22  January  allowed  the  appeals  of  Mr  Bhaveshkumar
    Pravinbhai Sathawara, Mrs Khodidas Nipeshkumar Khadiya,  Mr  Kalpanaben
    Nipeshkumar Kadiya and Master Mihir Nipeshkumar Kadiya who had appealed
    against a decision of the Secretary of State made on 22 April  2013  to
    refuse  Mr  Bhaveshkumar  Pravinbhai   Sathawara   and   Mrs   Khodidas
    Nipeshkumar Khadiya leave to remain as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrants.
    The other two appellants are their dependants.  Although the  Secretary
    of State is the appellant in the appeals before me I will for  ease  of
    reference refer to her as the respondent  as  she  was  the  respondent
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Similarly  I  will  refer  to   Mr
    Bhaveshkumar Pravinbhai Sathawara, Mrs Khodidas Nipeshkumar Khadiya, Mr
    Kalpanaben Nipeshkumar Kadiya and Master Mihir  Nipeshkumar  Kadiya  as
    the appellants as  they  were  the  appellants  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

2.   The first two appellants ("the appellants")  applications were  refused
    under the points-based system on the basis that they  were  awarded  no
    points for attributes under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules as they
    had not provided the appropriate documents required under 41-SD table 4
    in that they had not supplied a  letter  from  each  of  the  financial
    institution holding funds to confirm the amounts of funds available  to
    the appellants as the letter from their parents' banks  did  not  state
    their names and confirm that the money could be transferred to Britain.
     Moreover, the third party declaration from their mother  stating  that
    she had made the money available to the appellants  to  invest  in  the
    business  in  the  United  Kingdom  did  not  contain  the  appellants'
    signatures as well as the signature of the third party and therefore it
    was not considered that they had shown that they had access to at least
    ï¿½200,000 to invest in Britain as specified  under  Appendix  A  of  the
    Rules.  A third party declaration with all  the  necessary  information
    was produced.

3.   The judge stated that the situation before him was very different  from
    a situation where it is not at all clear that the funds were  available
    to the appellants and the third party declarations were also deficient.
     In paragraph 17 he stated:-

         "It should not have taken much thought to realise  that  the  funds
         were available to the appellants and the checks  of  signatures  in
         documents or other information in those circumstances added  little
         if the Bank of India letters were genuine [except for the fact that
         requirements of the PBS make such information mandatory].  There is
         nothing from the respondent to  suggest  that  the  Bank  of  India
         letters are anything but genuine."

4.   The judge then  referred  to  the  determination  of  the  Tribunal  in
    Rodriguez (Flexibility policy) [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC)  which  referred
    to the policy letter of  19  May  2011  which  stated  that  during  an
    unspecified trial stage applicants should be contacted where  mandatory
    evidence was missing from their applications and that  they  should  be
    given the opportunity to provide this.  UKBA was  under  a  public  law
    duty to give effect to the policy in all cases to which it applied.

5.   The judge found that the  respondent  had  failed  to  follow  her  own
    policy and therefore that her decision was wrong in law and that  in  a
    case of this sort where the third party had  actually  transferred  the
    funds into accounts in the appellants' names  a  fair  decision  making
    process would have prompted a request for missing information.

6.   The judge ended his determination by stating:-

          "The  appeals  are  allowed  to  the  limited  extent   that   the
         respondent's decisions are not  in  accordance  with  the  law  and
         remain  outstanding   before   the   respondent   awaiting   lawful
         decisions."

7.   The grounds of appeal argued that the judge had misdirected himself  in
    law, stating that the determination Rodriguez had  been  considered  by
    the Court of Appeal and in a judgment promulgated on  20  January  2014
    the Court of Appeal had made it clear that

         "requests for information  should  not  be  speculative  and  -  as
         subsequently reiterated -  there  must  be  sufficient  reasons  to
         believe that any evidence requested existed."

     Moreover it had been ruled that the evidential flexibility  policy  was
    not

         "designed to give an applicant the opportunity first to remedy  any
         defect or inadequacy in the application or supporting documentation
         so as to  save  the  application  from  refusal  after  substantive
         consideration."

     It was stated therefore that in the light of the judgment of the  Court
    of Appeal the Secretary of State was under  no  obligation  to  request
    further documents from the appellant.  There was no suggestion  in  the
    determination  that  a  satisfactory  bank  letter   or   third   party
    declaration was in existence as at the date of decision and  there  was
    not sufficient reason to believe that the required evidence existed and
    therefore any request made for further documentation  would  have  been
    entirely speculative.  The  evidential  policy  was  qualified  by  the
    instructions requested information should not be speculative.

8.   The application for permission was considered by Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Page and granted on the basis that the judge had made  no
    reference to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Rodriguez.

9.   At the hearing of the appeal before me Ms Isherwood stated that it  was
    evident that although the appeal had been heard and  the  determination
    drafted before the date of the judgment of  the  Court  of  Appeal  the
    determination had been promulgated two days after the judgment had been
    issued.  The reality was that the determination of the  Upper  Tribunal
    in Rodriguez had been overturned and as the appellants had not provided
    all the documents required the appeals should  not  have  been  allowed
    even to the limited extent where the applications had been remitted  to
    the Secretary of State.  In any event she pointed out  that  the  Rules
    had changed on 6 September 2012 and therefore the flexibility policy as
    set out in the determination in Rodriguez was  by  that  stage  out  of
    date.  She was unable to let me know whether  or  not  the  flexibility
    policy had been taken down from the respondent's website when the Rules
    had been changed.

10.  She argued that as the appellants were not  entitled  to  rely  on  the
    documents which had been produced after the date of decision the appeal
    should have been dismissed.

11.  In reply Mr Khan stated that this was not a case of  missing  documents
    but merely of missing information which had been  provided  before  the
    judge.  The judge was entitled to take it into account  and  find  that
    the issue before her had  been  resolved  and  therefore  that  it  was
    appropriate that that should be considered by the Secretary  of  State.
    He referred to the judgment of the Court  of  Appeal  at  paragraph  49
    which noted that the 2009  version  of  the  instructions  relating  to
    evidential flexibility had stated that "this  procedure  describes  the
    steps to take when an application has missing evidence or  there  is  a
    minor error".  Moreover in that judgment it was stated that the overall
    intent was to afford

         "some alleviation to the  harshness  of  the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration  Rules  by  sanctioning,  in   certain   circumstances,
         requests for further information from applicants."

12.  The reality was the judge had considered  that  there  were  two  minor
    problems and that these should not have led to the refusal  or,  having
    led to the refusal the decision of the judge to remit  the  application
    to the Secretary of State was clearly open to him.

Discussion

13.  I have some sympathy with  the  judge  in  this  case  because  he  was
    entitled to consider and interpret the determination of the Tribunal in
    Rodriguez when he heard  the  appeal  and  drafted  the  determination.
    However the judgment of the Court of Appeal is declaratory and makes it
    clear that the conclusions of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Rodriguez  were
    incorrect.

14.  Moreover, the  reality  is  that  at  the  time  of  the  decision  the
    requisite  evidence  in  the  appropriate  form  was  not  before   the
    respondent.  That is the relevant date and  in  a  points-based  system
    appeal further evidence postdating the decision which  was  not  before
    the respondent should not be taken into account.

15.  I therefore find that  there  was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the Tribunal.

16.  I therefore set aside the decision of the Tribunal and substitute,  for
    the above reasons,  my own decision that this appeal is dismissed.

17.  It does appear that relevant evidence  may  well  be  available  to  be
    produced in a fresh application and I trust that the Secretary of State
    will now deal with that application, provided it is made timeously,  as
    soon as possible taking into account  all  relevant  documentation  and
    indeed taking into account the business plan which was placed before me
    at the hearing.
