                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.     The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of  Iraq.   He  appeals  against  the
      determination of an adjudicator, Mr  A  W  Palmer  promulgated  on  13
      August 2002 dismissing his appeal against the refusal of the Secretary
      of State on 22 February 2002 to grant him leave to  enter  the  United
      Kingdom.  The appellant had claimed, but had been refused, asylum, and
      he appealed to the Adjudicator on asylum and human rights grounds.

2.    Mr R Franck of Counsel instructed by Messrs  Hasan  appeared  for  the
      appellant.   The  Secretary  of  State  was  represented   by   Senior
      Presenting Officer Miss A Holmes.

3.    The appellant is from Sulaimaniyah in  the  Kurdish  Autonomous  Area.
      It is controlled by the PUK. In 1999 he formed a relationship  with  a
      young woman from a strictly Islamic family, supporters  of  IMIK.   He
      supports the Communist Party himself.

4.    When, in May or June of 2001 he asked her  parents  for  her  hand  in
      marriage he was very firmly rebuffed by the family and he  was  called
      drunkard and her brother threatened to kill them  both.   Her  brother
      beat her.

5.    In July 2001 the couple ran away together to Iran but, after a  couple
      of weeks, the girl was abducted by her family, taken back to Iraq, and
      he learned from a relative that she had been killed.

6.    The appellant said that he had learned from his father that there  was
      a hunt on for him and that the girl's family  would  kill  him  if  he
      returned to Iraq and so he fled, via Turkey, to the United Kingdom. In
      what seems to us to be in conflict with that  evidence  given  to  the
      Adjudicator the appellant also told him that he had gone to the police
      but they could not help because the girl's parents were very  powerful
      people.

7.    The Adjudicator did not believe the appellant's account.   He  thought
      that the version given at interview was seriously inconsistent at many
      points, which he outlined in his determination, from what was said  in
      evidence.

8.    In one respect the  Adjudicator  was  mistaken.   When  the  appellant
      referred to the girl's family being involved in  Bezuthnawar  that  is
      not in conflict with his statement  that  they  were  members  of  the
      Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan, (IMIK), they are, in fact one and
      the same.  Where apparent discrepancies concerned dates the Appellant,
      because of  the  difficulties  of  translating  from  so  different  a
      calendar, might have been  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,
      although to confuse 21 March 1999 with 21 March  1997  is  not  easily
      explained.

9.    There remains discrepancies still  unexplained,  they  are  not  minor
      ones.  The appellant said that the girl's uncle and  brother  came  to
      find her in Iran.  At interview he said that it was her  parents.   He
      said that the girl was beaten  up  by  her  brother  when  the  family
      learned of their relationship when he made his initial statement.   He
      said that his girlfriend's brother and two  other  men  threatened  to
      kill them if they refused to end the relationship.  He said nothing of
      any attack upon himself.  When interviewed he said that he was  beaten
      by them for ten minutes with a machine gun.  We consider that  it  was
      open to the Adjudicator, and would have remained open  to  him  making
      allowance for such errors  as  he  made,  to  regard  the  Appellant's
      account as one about which the appellant was inconsistent  because  he
      was not relating the truth but was making it up as he went along.

10.   What, however, if  the  account  were  basically  the  truth  and  the
      appellant has found serious disfavour with  a  strict  Muslim  family,
      involved with IMIK?  What then?

11.   We have read the skeleton argument produced by Mr Franck.   He  refers
      to the Judicial review case of Hussain as quoted in  McDonald  -  that
      credibility finding is not in itself a  valid  and  finding  an  over-
      emphasis upon it might distort an otherwise appropriate  finding.   He
      contest that there is a  sufficiency  of  protection  in  the  Kurdish
      Autonomous Area.  He produced to  us  the  Tribunal  determination  in
      Hussain Abdullah Ahmed of January 2002, although, other than the  fact
      that in that case also IMIK were  the  feared  protagonists,  we  find
      little in it of  similarity  let  alone  relevance  unless  it  is  to
      persuade  us  that  the  religious  fervour  of  IMIK   introduces   a
      "Convention Reason". We do  not  adversely  criticise  Mr  Franck  for
      failing to make clear to us his  purpose  in  producing  the  case  of
      Ahmed.  He conceded that it was of little, if any, assistance in  view
      of the greater persuasive influence of the more  recent  determination
      in Karzan Abdullah Khalid by a Tribunal of Legal  Members  chaired  by
      the Deputy President.

12.   Miss Holmes also produced a  Home  Office  Operational  Guidance  Note
      upon Iraq of October 2002 and we asked Mr Franck  if  he  could  still
      maintain his grounds against  the  material  contained  in  these  two
      documents.   He  endeavoured  to  do  so.   He  suggested   that   the
      Adjudicator had produced a determination of which it  could  still  be
      said that the credibility findings  were  wholly  unsatisfactory.   We
      have already set out our finding  upon  that.   He  pointed  out  that
      credibility is linked to the standard of proof and although there is a
      reasonable margin of appreciation a  determination  must  be  properly
      reasoned.  He suggested that this appeal might be remitted to be heard
      afresh by a different Adjudicator.

13.   We do not accept that submission.  We come back to  the  question  "If
      the appellant had been believed how would it have helped?"

14.   In Khalid, heard on 6 September 2002, the  Tribunal  referred  to  the
      loss of power by IMIK and the ability of the PUK  to  protected.   The
      facts, we accept, were different from the present case.

15.   The guidance note to which we have referred explores the  question  of
      honour  killings  in  the  Autonomous  Area.   They  are  taken   very
      seriously.  There is a political will to do something  bout  it.   The
      PUK and KDP are willing to protect anyone, male or female, in fear  of
      reprisals.  They are now considered to be murder and prison  sentences
      may be issued by the Courts.

16.   As to IMIK as a result of fighting which broke out  between  Islamists
      and the PUK in October 2001 the PUK have taken from  IMIK  control  of
      Halabja.   IMIK  has  splintered  into  a  myriad  of   groups.    The
      authorities would be willing and able to offer  protection  to  anyone
      claiming to be in fear of Islamists.

17.   Finally, what of those in control?  Relations between the PUK and  KDP
      have  improved:  they  have  convened  a   fully   functioning   joint
      Parliament.

18.   That is the latest  objective  information.   We  see  nothing  to  be
      gained for the appellant  by  remitting  this  appeal.   It  would  be
      irresponsible of us, in our  view,  to  do  so  and  contrary  to  the
      approach we are required by the Procedure Rules to adopt when we can.

19.   The grant  of  leave  gave  opportunity  for  any  problems  with  the
      determination of the Adjudicator to be fully aired, explored and as we
      believe appropriate, remedied.  For the  reasons  which  we  have  now
      fully explained we consider that applying the lower standard of  proof
      appropriate there is shown no reason to conclude that the  refusal  to
      grant leave to enter would involve the United Kingdom in a  breach  of
      either the  Refugee  or  Human  Rights  Convention,  nor,  having  re-
      considered the reasons for it, do we find it necessary or  appropriate
      to interfere with the outcome of the appeal before the Adjudicator.

This appeal is therefore dismissed.
