                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge  Gillian  Raikes),  sitting  at  Stoke-on-Trent  on  15
    February 2011, to  an article 8  appeal by  a  citizen  of  China.  The
    appeal has been through a grant of leave by, and a hearing in the Upper
    Tribunal, and an application for permission to appeal to the  Court  of
    Appeal. Following that, a review took place under rr. 45 -  46  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, and the Upper  Tribunal
    decision was sent aside, with directions, as a result of which I needed
    to consider in the first place whether Judge Raikes had made  an  error
    of law which required a re-hearing.



 2. The review decision  relied  heavily  on  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Lord Menzies and  Judge  Peter  Lane)  in  Hayat  (nature  of
    Chikwamba principle) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 444 (IAC),  since  overturned
    by the Court of Appeal (Maurice Kay LJ, Vice-President,  Elias  LJ  and
    Sir David Keene) in Hayat (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054  ,  published
    on 31 July. Elias LJ, for the court, set out the following  principles,
    on the basis of  Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 and other leading  cases,  at
    paragraph 30:

          i. Where an applicant who does not  have  lawful  entry  clearance
             pursues an Article 8 claim, a dismissal of  the  claim  on  the
             procedural ground that the policy requires that  the  applicant
             should have made the application from his home state  may  (but
             not necessarily will) constitute  a  disruption  of  family  or
             private life sufficient to engage Article 8, particularly where
             children are adversely affected.
         ii. Where Article 8 is  engaged,  it  will  be  a  disproportionate
             interference with family or private  life  to  enforce  such  a
             policy unless ... there is a sensible reason for doing so.
        iii. Whether it is sensible to enforce that policy will  necessarily
             be fact sensitive; Lord Brown  identified  certain  potentially
             relevant  factors  in  Chikwamba.   They   will   include   the
             prospective length and degree of disruption of family life  and
             whether other members of the family are settled in the UK.
         iv. Where Article 8 is engaged and there is no sensible reason  for
             enforcing the policy, the decision maker should  determine  the
             Article 8 claim on its substantive merits, having regard to all
             material factors, notwithstanding that  the  applicant  has  no
             lawful entry clearance.
          v. [deals with the practice of the Court of Appeal]
         vi. Nothing in Chikwamba was intended to alter the way  the  courts
             should approach substantive Article 8 issues as  laid  down  in
             such well known cases as Razgar and Huang.
        vii. Although the cases do not say this in terms, in my judgment  if
             the Secretary of State has no sensible reason for requiring the
             application to be made from the home state, the  fact  that  he
             has failed to do so [sc. that the applicant has not done  that]
             should not thereafter  carry  any  weight  in  the  substantive
             Article 8 balancing exercise.

 3. Issues of law   While the Secretary of  State's  appeal  in  Hayat  was
    allowed (and the other appellant's appeal dismissed), I  do  not  think
    there is anything to be gained by discussing the facts of either  case.
    The question is whether the judge in the present case failed  to  apply
    the principles set out by the Court of Appeal, whose decision  was  not
    of course available to her. Mr O'Ryan divided the grant  of  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against her decision into three points,
    which I have given names for convenience:

     a) [the funding point] the judge failed to give proper reasons for not
        being satisfied  that  there  would  be  adequate  maintenance  and
        accommodation for the appellant without recourse to  public  funds,
        given that she took this point into  account  against  her  on  her
        proportionality assessment at paragraph 30 (e);

     b)  [the  family  life  point]  the  judge  made  findings  about  the
        appellant's relationship with her husband (at 30 (b) - (d)),  which
        were inconsistent with the judge's acceptance at  paragraph  32  of
        concessions made in the Home Office refusal letter, to  the  effect
        that

             ... the Appellant and his wife  [sc.  the  appellant  and  her
             husband]  have  been  in  a  relationship  and  married  on  6
             September 2010 and that the Appellant has established a family
             and private life in the United Kingdom.

     c)  [the  immigration  history  point]  this  was  not  one  of  those
        comparatively rare cases (though it  does  not  involve  children),
        where an article 8 appeal should be dismissed on the basis that  it
        would be proportionate and more appropriate for  the  appellant  to
        apply for leave from abroad "particularly given that the  appellant
        did not have an appalling immigration history".

 4. Appellant's immigration history     At this point it may be  useful  to
    set it out. The judge recorded, though apparently not from Home  Office
    sources, that the appellant, now 52, had arrived  and  been  given  six
    months' leave to enter as a visitor in 2004. The Home Office  heard  no
    more from her, till on 5 March 2010 she applied for, and  on  4  August
    got a certificate of approval under the  procedure  then  in  force  to
    marry Mr George Emmott, now 80 and a citizen of this country, and on  6
    September 2010 she did so. Meanwhile on 23 August, in the course of  an
    appointment with the registrar of marriages, she was served with notice
    of illegal entry, and on 17 September responded with an application for
    leave to remain as the wife of Mr  Emmott,  which  was  refused  on  18
    November. On 20 December the appellant was given notice of the decision
    to remove her as an illegal entrant. This was the decision  which  gave
    her the right of appeal on human rights grounds which she exercised.

 5. Conclusions on error of law         There was a good deal  of  argument
    before me on all three of the points at 3; but, given the conclusion  I
    have reached, I can give my views on them fairly shortly.

     a) While the judge did not deal with the availability  of  funding  in
        the detail which would have been  required  in  a  case  under  the
        Immigration Rules, she did indicate in general terms  at  paragraph
        30 (e) why she was not satisfied on this  point.  It  was  for  the
        appellant to satisfy her, and she did not do so.

     b) It was perfectly open to the judge to accept that the appellant and
        Mr Emmott had established a family life together here, but  at  the
        same time to make negative findings as to how close it was: on  the
        other hand, the findings made in this  case  might  be  thought  to
        point in the direction of their having no genuine  family  life  at
        all.

     c) While the appellant's immigration history might not be 'appalling',
        in the same sense as that of Ekinci [2005] EWCA Civ  1482,  it  was
        quite bad enough to provide a 'sensible reason' in terms  of  Hayat
        for the Home Office to insist, other things being equal,  that  she
        should apply for leave from abroad.

 6. The difficulty to my mind with the judge's decision  in  this  case  is
    that it did not satisfactorily resolve  the  question  of  whether  the
    appellant's marriage to Mr Emmott was a real one,  in  the  sense  that
    they were living together as man and wife, and not  in  the  way  of  a
    front put up, at least on the appellant's part, to  get  her  leave  to
    remain in this country to which she was  not  otherwise  entitled.  The
    Home Office for their part had evidently been satisfied at the time  of
    the marriage that it was not a sham, or  they  would  either  not  have
    issued the certificate of approval for it as they did on 4 August 2010,
    or would have taken steps to revoke the certificate, and so prevent the
    marriage, following the immigration officer's  visit  to  the  registry
    office on the 23rd. It seems that the judge took the same  view,  given
    her finding on the existence of family life between the  appellant  and
    Mr Emmott.

 7. On the other hand, the judge's findings at 30 b) and c) go back to  the
    differences in recollection between the appellant and Mr Emmott  as  to
    when  and  how  they  had  first  met.  According  to  the  appellant's
    application form, and Mr Emmott's recollection, this  had  been  in  or
    about March 2009; but the appellant had  some  difficulty  remembering,
    and gave a date of September 2008. Both effectively  agreed  that  they
    had met through another Chinese lady who ran  a  shop  in  the  Arndale
    Centre  in  Manchester:  the  difference  was  between  the   appellant
    suggesting that they  had  both  known  this  lady  before,  apparently
    contrary to Mr Emmott's evidence about himself, and possibly as  to  Mr
    Emmott's evidence that the appellant had  been  part  of  a  "group  of
    girls" with whom he had gone out to dinner.

 8. The judge's finding at 30 (d) is in a slightly different  category:  it
    refers to the appellant's not having told Mr Emmott  that  she  was  an
    overstayer till his interview with the immigration officer on 23 August
    2010 made that plain. That might relate to their closeness or otherwise
    at the date of  their  marriage.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  the
    acceptance by the Home Office and the judge that even so  the  marriage
    was no sham; and the lack of any findings on  the  part  of  the  judge
    relating directly to the quality of the family life  they  had  at  the
    date of the hearing before her.

 9. If the appellant and Mr Emmott had gone through a ceremony of  marriage
    which was a complete sham, then there would have been no need  for  the
    Home Office to call on any rule about  making  such  applications  from
    abroad: this appeal would simply have failed on its merits. Equally,  a
    similar appeal by someone with a truly  appalling  immigration  history
    would almost inevitably have failed on the  basis  that  there  was  an
    unanswerable 'sensible reason' for requiring her to apply from  abroad.
    On the other hand, an application by someone  whose  leave  had  fairly
    recently expired by the date of her marriage, or her  application,  who
    had a clearly solid marriage, with  no  funding  problems,  might  have
    expected to have succeeded on the merits of her article 8 case, on  the
    basis that there was no 'sensible reason' for requiring her to make  an
    application from abroad.

10. By the date of the hearing this appellant had spent about  seven  years
    in this country, only the first six months (if she is right  about  her
    visit visa) with any kind of leave, and after that only  the  last  two
    years with the knowledge of the Home Office. She says, which  may  well
    be true, that she stayed so long to be with her son, who first came  as
    a student, and later had some form of post-study work leave. Her  other
    explanation was that she didn't know English, and so had  no  means  of
    seeking to regularize her situation: the judge (see 30a) did not accept
    this, and was clearly entitled to her view on that.



11.  There  was  another  negative  point  against  the  appellant  on  her
    immigration history, which is that she had kept Mr Emmott in  the  dark
    about it, till the immigration officer appeared at the registry office.
    Again she claimed to have had  language  problems  when  she  tried  to
    explain the situation to Mr Emmott;  but  again  the  judge  was  fully
    entitled to take the view that, if she was  as  close  to  him  as  she
    claimed, then she would have made sure he knew. What  this  finding  by
    the judge does make clear is that Mr Emmott was not to blame  for  what
    happened. According to her (see 37), he

       ... indicated that her lack of status did not  present  a  particular
       problem to him once he had knowledge of it, given his age, health and
       circumstances the omission of such information  calls  into  question
       the intentions of the Appellant when entering into the relationship.

12. That seems to me like a more polite way of saying that  the  judge  was
    not satisfied that the appellant had intended to enter into  a  genuine
    marriage, because she had chosen to keep Mr Emmott in  the  dark  about
    it. The reference to  Mr  Emmott's  health  was  about  his  having  an
    emergency gall bladder removal, "complicated by negative septic�mia" in
    about 2009, and  continuing  to  suffer  what  had  been  provisionally
    diagnosed as  rheumatoid  arthritis,  affecting  his  hands  and  other
    joints, leaving him according to his GP "unable to do his shoe laces or
    hold a cap [sc. cup]". According to Mr Emmott  and  the  appellant  she
    does all the cooking and cleaning in their house, making sure  that  he
    does not have the fatty foods with which he could not  cope  without  a
    gall bladder, and also helps him put on his  shoes  and  socks  in  the
    morning.

13. While the judge may have been justified  in  saying  (at  39)  that  Mr
    Emmott could look after himself, in the sense of not absolutely needing
    the sort of care which would be provided in a nursing or similar  home,
    he clearly relies on the appellant very much, and the  judge's  finding
    that there was no evidence that her having to go back to China,  either
    to apply for a  visa or to live there "... would significantly  disrupt
    and affect them" may be much more open to  question.  While  the  judge
    certainly took account of Mr Emmott's  rights,  mentioning  Beoku-Betts
    [2008] UKHL 39, in the end it is on  this  part  of  the  case  that  I
    consider that the judge needed more clearly to  resolve  the  potential
    discrepancy between her acceptance  of  family  life  at  32,  and  her
    suggestion at 37 that the appellant had effectively been exploiting her
    proposed marriage, only a few days before it, in her own interests.

14. While the present situation may  well  not  be  incompatible  with  the
    appellant's having set out to get a  British  citizen  for  a  husband,
    whatever his age or health, so as to  be  allowed  to  remain  in  this
    country with her son, so far  as  Mr  Emmott's  article  8  rights  are
    concerned, those had to be assessed as at the date of the  hearing.  If
    it were accepted that by this time that the appellant remained together
    with him out of genuine  mutual  love  and  affection,  then  he  would
    clearly not only have some difficulty in coping  while  she  was  away,
    even if that were only for the length of time (as to which there is  no
    evidence) that it would take her to get her visa. On the other hand, if
    the appellant's motives were not genuine, Mr Emmott would  risk  losing
    her altogether, once she had leave to remain in this country.



15. That in my view was the main reason why the judge needed to resolve the
    question about the appellant's  current  motives  in  staying  with  Mr
    Emmott more clearly than she did, in what was  otherwise  both  a  very
    clear and a very careful decision. The result was  inevitably  a  fresh
    hearing, which did not take place till 18 June 2013, when it was listed
    for London, so as to avoid any further delays.

16. Fresh hearing    Not  only  the  appellant  and  Mr  Emmott  gave  oral
    evidence, but her son Mr Wang Xiaoguang as well. These are the relevant
    events, some of which have already been  referred  to:  the  source  is
    given where the date depends on the oral evidence.

             2004   appellant comes to visit Mr Wang and overstays
       March  2009  appellant says she and Mr Emmott meet
       October       Mr Emmott taken into hospital to  have  part  of  gall-
                    bladder removed and develops pulmonary embolism
    26 April       2010      Mr  Emmott  swears  affidavit  in  support  of
                    application  for  certificate  of  approval  for   their
                    marriage, also  giving  March  2009  as  date  of  their
                    meeting
      4 August             certificate of approval granted
    23 August              notice of illegal entry served on appellant
      6 September   appellant and Mr Emmott married
    17 September    appellant applies for leave to remain as his wife
    18 November     application refused
    20 December     decision to remove served

17. Issues    Helpfully, Miss Warren and Mr Bramble were able to agree on a
    number of points:

     a) the appellant could not satisfy the current funding test for  leave
        to enter or remain as a wife, under  the  present  version  of  the
        Immigration Rules (incorporating HC 1038, HC 1039 and Cm 8599); but

     b) in one way or another,  she  could  satisfy  the  previous  (income
        support level) test (see KA and Others  (Adequacy  of  maintenance)
        Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065).

    The result of their agreement on these two points is that the appellant
    can only succeed under article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention;  but,
    since she can show that her basic maintenance  could  be  provided  for
    without further resort to public funds,  over  and  above  the  pension
    received by Mr Emmott, funding provides no real obstacle to that.

18. The parties also agreed that

     c) if I had to consider the tests under the current Immigration Rules,
        then there would be 'insurmountable obstacles', given  Mr  Emmott's
        age and state of health, to him and the  appellant  pursuing  their
        family life together in China; and

     d) their marriage is clearly 'subsisting'; so

     e) the only question to be decided under the Rules  would  be  whether
        the marriage was also 'genuine', in the sense that it is  a  matter
        of mutual devotion, rather than some ulterior motive. There  is  no
        dispute but that  this  is  the  case,  so  far  as  Mr  Emmott  is
        concerned.

19. The result is that the main question of fact  remaining  for  decision,
    either under the Rules themselves or under the Convention jurisprudence
    on article 8, is whether the appellant entered into and remains in  the
    marriage for genuine reasons. The main, if not the only reason why  the
    Home Office say that is not so is in her immigration history (see 10  -
    11): this might also be a reason for considering  it  proportionate  to
    the legitimate purpose of  to require the appellant to return to  China
    and apply for a wife visa from there.

20. Evidence         The  appellant  said  she  was  still  here,  in  2009
    following what should have been a six months' visit to her son,  simply
    because she hadn't been able to find a lawyer or anyone  else  to  help
    her regularize her situation with the Home Office: I did not  hear  any
    suggestion as  to  how  this  might  have  been  achieved  without  the
    intervention of Mr Emmott. Her son, for his part, had been  helped  get
    the visa extensions he had needed by his college..

21. Neither the appellant nor Mr Emmott say anything to speak of  in  their
    witness statements about how they met. In oral evidence  they  told  me
    they had been introduced by a lady known as Mary (her Chinese name,  or
    part of it, is Siao May) who ran a massage parlour  in  Manchester.  Mr
    Emmott had used to go there almost  daily,  for  some  relief  for  his
    arthritis, and particularly his  back:  the  appellant  was  a  friend,
    rather than an employee of Mary's. Asked why Mary hadn't been called to
    give evidence, the appellant said she had just given birth:  there  was
    no letter, either from a doctor or Mary  herself  about  that,  and  no
    statement from her either.

22. In about March 2009 (Mr Emmott was at  best  hazy  on  dates,  but  the
    appellant was able to give them), Mary had arranged for  all  three  of
    them to go out to dinner together. They got  on  well,  and  Mary,  not
    entirely seriously, had told Mr Emmott he should marry  the  appellant;
    but he had already decided that she was the one for him, and  he  asked
    her to do so as early as the following month,  though  she  refused  at
    that stage. As for how they talked to each other, he said "I understand
    her English, though it's dodgy, and she understands me. Right from  the
    start we more or less understood each other." She  says  she  told  him
    then about her lack of immigration status: he  couldn't  remember  when
    she had told him; but it hadn't been a problem for him in any case.

23. At this time Mr Emmott, who had been living on his own  since  he  lost
    his wife some time in the previous decade, was still quite independent.
    He stayed that way for the time being, and he and the appellant went on
    seeing each other regularly. In October 2009 he was taken into hospital
    for an emergency operation on his gall bladder, and kept in for a month
    after developing a pulmonary embolism. It had  been  his  daughter  who
    took him in, and he didn't know where the appellant had  been  at  that
    time. He said "I could still look after myself reasonably well  when  I
    came out, but old age caught up  with  me.  Everything  started  to  go
    wrong; pains and all, that I didn't have before. I asked her  to  marry
    me practically right away after I came out. It didn't take long  before
    she said yes: I browbeat her into it."

24. Mr Emmott swore his affidavit for the certificate of approval in  April
    2010: in it he says the appellant had finally agreed to  marry  him  on
    the 8th; by this time they were  going  out  daily  (as  he  explained,
    window-) shopping together, as they still do. He says she is "wonderful
    and caring"; but there is nothing about any dependency yet. However, he
    says by the time their  marriage  took  place  that  September  he  was
    getting worse: the appellant moved in some weeks before  the  ceremony,
    and after that he had really not had to bother to look after himself.

25. Mr Emmott appeared for the hearing looking very neat in  a  jacket  and
    well-tied tie, which he said he had done himself; but, because  of  the
    arthritis in his knees, he found it impossible to bend down, and so  it
    was the appellant who put on his  shoes  and  socks  for  him,  besides
    cooking, cleaning and doing everything else around the house.  He  says
    he would be "devastated" if she had to go back to China: he would  need
    a carer.

26. There are two letters from Mr Emmott's  GP,  Dr  Justyna  Davis:  on  3
    December 2010 she simply records his hospital treatment  that  October,
    and that he  was  still  under  the  hospital  for  his  anti-coagulant
    treatment: he had been advised to have a carer,  or  at  least  someone
    with him when he was out and about. By 3 May 2013 Dr Davis also had  to
    record Mr Emmott's shortness of breath, following the embolism; and the
    diagnosis of 'arthralgia of multiple joints', which had been made by  a
    consultant rheumatologist, under whose care he remained  for  that.  It
    came out in recurrent swelling and chronic pain to his hands and knees;
    he also had pain and stiffness from osteoarthritis in his lower back.

27. Mr Wang said he was now a visa consultant, in partnership with the Bank
    of China; but when his mother overstayed her visit in 2005 he had still
    been studying at language school. He didn't  think  she  was  using  Mr
    Emmott to help her stay in this country: he  asked,  rhetorically,  why
    she hadn't made such an arrangement before? Mr Wang  told  me  that  by
    November 2011 he had been here ten years with leave, including the last
    two as  a  post-study  work  migrant,  and  had  applied  for  and  got
    indefinite leave to remain on that basis. He was married to a girl born
    in China, who had not had indefinite leave to remain herself when  they
    married, and they had since had twins.

28. Conclusions     The appellant was badly advised by her  solicitors  and
    counsel not at least to  try  to  give  evidence  in  English,  however
    inadequate hers may have been: I gave her the  opportunity  to  do  so,
    with the  interpreter  standing  by  to  help  if  necessary;  but  she
    declined. Without hearing her own words, it is hard for me to form  any
    real first-hand assessment of her character and motives, not to mention
    the quality of her interaction with Mr Emmott; but  I  have  to  do  my
    best.

29. I do not accept that the appellant was  simply  waiting  helplessly  in
    this country since 2005, for want of someone to advise her about how to
    sort out her position here, for the eventual arrival of  Mr  Emmott  in
    2010. Her son no doubt did have help from his college, so  long  as  he
    was there; but by 2009 he had finished his studies,  and  gone  out  to
    work, work which has now led him into the immigration field himself. He
    has successfully taken advantage of the opportunity then offered by the
    system to get indefinite leave to remain, after ten  years  here  on  a
    temporary basis, and to marry a wife who  had  no  other  claim  to  it
    herself.

30. Then there is  Mary:  I  do  not  accept  that  it  was  simply  recent
    childbirth that kept her from being called to give evidence.  If  there
    had been any plan for her to do so, then no  doubt  a  statement  would
    have been taken from her at an early stage; but, quite  extraordinarily
    in view of the issues raised, she is not even mentioned  in  either  of
    the appellant's, nor Mr  Emmott's  statements  (before  the  first-tier
    judge or before me). They do not seem to have mentioned  her  in  their
    oral evidence before the judge either, other than (the appellant) as "a
    friend" or (Mr Emmott) "a Chinese lady"; however Mr  Emmott  does  give
    her name as Mary in his certificate of approval affidavit. There is  no
    explanation as to why Mary, as an  established  businesswoman  in  this
    country, could not have  either  given  the  appellant  advice  on  her
    immigration situation  herself  ,  or  at  least  pointed  her  in  the
    direction of someone who could do so, rather  than  simply  introducing
    her to a suitable English husband.

31. As for Mr Wang himself, no doubt he is delighted to see his mother with
    a good hope of being settled in this country, and able to see a lot  of
    him and his family, no doubt giving some help with the twins. All  that
    is entirely natural; but it hardly makes  him  a  reliable  independent
    witness as to her motives or feelings for Mr Emmott. I cannot think how
    the appellant could have regularized her status here before  Mr  Emmott
    came on the scene: though, as Mr Wang pointed out,  she  certainly  had
    not tried to do so in any way before, including marriage, that may have
    been because no suitor with the necessary status had appeared.

32. In my view it is more likely than not that Mary, whose position as  the
    owner of a massage parlour entirely fitted her for the r�le, acted  not
    just as a friend to the appellant, but as a regular go-between. I think
    the appellant set out to get an English husband,  and  would  not  have
    married someone of Mr Emmott's age, even if his health was better  when
    they met, if it had not been for the need to get leave  to  remain  for
    herself. She may have refused him when he first offered,  as  he  says;
    but, if that was a tactic, then it would have been an entirely sensible
    one.

33. That rather negative finding rejects the genuineness of  the  marriage,
    from the appellant's point of view, at its inception. However,  I  also
    need to consider the position now. She and Mr Emmott have  been  living
    together since shortly before their marriage in September  2010:  since
    about that time, he has become more and more disabled by arthritis  and
    shortness of breath, to the extent now set out in the 2013  GP  letter,
    so that he is practically dependent on the appellant  in  most  of  the
    details of everyday life.

34. Mr Bramble understandably suggested to Mr Emmott that he  regarded  the
    appellant more as  a  carer  than  a  wife,  which  Mr  Emmott  equally
    understandably denied. I don't think any hard  and  fast  line  can  be
    drawn: marriage for a man in his 80s,  certainly  one  in  Mr  Emmott's
    state of health, means something different from what  it  would  for  a
    younger man. Though a woman still in her 50s might like  (and,  subject
    to her immigration  status,  expect)  something  more,  that  does  not
    necessarily mean that the appellant is still doing no more  than  using
    Mr Emmott as a means to an end.



35. The appellant has been living with and  looking  after  Mr  Emmott  for
    nearly three years now, and, so far as his particular complaints allow,
    he looks well and happy and well cared for. I do not doubt for a moment
    that he would be "devastated" if she had to go back to China. No  doubt
    he would be even more devastated if, once she got indefinite  leave  to
    remain as his wife, she were to leave him to his own  devices.  However
    he clearly does not believe that would happen; and, on balance, neither
    do I. If the appellant won this appeal  outright,  then  the  most  she
    would get would be another three years' discretionary leave to  remain,
    or perhaps 2�, in line with the position of a wife under the Rules; and
    she could reasonably expect a close examination by the Home  Office  of
    her marital situation at that time.

36. So I do think Mr Emmott and the appellant are both living together in a
    genuine way as man and wife at the present time. The next  question  is
    whether she ought to be required to go back to China and  apply  for  a
    wife visa in  the  proper  form.  I  have  found  she  overstayed,  and
    deliberately set out to get herself an English husband as the only  way
    of regularizing her situation; so from that point of  view  the  answer
    should be yes: there  is  a  strong  public  interest  in  not  letting
    overstayers manipulate the immigration system to  their  own  advantage
    like that.

37. Looking at the situation from Mr Emmott's point of view, I  agree  with
    the judge that he more likely than not did not realize exactly what the
    appellant's immigration situation was,  till  the  immigration  officer
    came and interrupted their meeting with the registrar of marriages.  Of
    course it made no great difference to him, as he said himself. While it
    was certainly less than public-spirited of Mr Emmott to prefer his  own
    happiness and comfort to the national interest in  trying  to  maintain
    some semblance of a functioning immigration control system, it was also
    understandable, particularly at his age; and  at  least  he  was  quite
    frank about it.

38. The information with which I have been provided from the UKBA  web-site
    about visa processing times in China suggests that, while over half the
    settlement applications (60%) are dealt with inside  ten  working  days
    (two weeks), it is eight weeks  before  the  vast  majority  (93%)  are
    decided on. Given the appellant's immigration history in this  country,
    and the other features of the case, any visa application by  her  would
    no doubt take somewhere near the upper end of that  time-scale  to  run
    its course.

39. Taking Mr Emmott's state of health as  set  out  in  the  2013  letter,
    together with the dependency he has undoubtedly acquired as a result of
    relying on the appellant for almost everything since their marriage  in
    2010, I think it would be seriously unsettling and distressing for  him
    to have to part with her even for eight weeks. It might still  be  said
    that this was a situation they had  brought  on  themselves;  but  that
    would be to overlook the r�le  of  the  Home  Office  in  granting  the
    certificate of approval for the marriage.

40. The evidence  suggests  that  neither  Mr  Emmott  nor  the  appellant,
    following their certificate of  approval  application  in  April  2010,
    would have moved in together till their marriage was imminent, which it
    became on the issue of the certificate  on  4  August.  That  state  of
    affairs was jolted, rather than  broken  up,  by  the  arrival  of  the
    immigration officer at the registry office to serve a notice of illegal
    entry on the 23rd; but the marriage was still allowed  to  take  place,
    rather than the certificate being revoked, or the  appellant  detained,
    on 4 September.

41. The result is that the Home Office must  bear  a  large  share  of  the
    responsibility for Mr Emmott's dependency on the appellant  as  it  has
    developed over the 2� years since then. In the particular circumstances
    of this very exceptional case, I do not consider it  necessary  in  the
    public interest to inflict on Mr Emmott  even  the  distress  which  he
    would be caused by sending the appellant back to  China  for  something
    like eight weeks for her to get a wife visa.
