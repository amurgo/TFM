Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Not present or represented


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. Whereas the respondent is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
       interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the  nomenclature
       of the decision at first instance.


    2. The appellant, born September 21, 1073 is a citizen  of  Nigeria.  He
       applied for entry clearance as a dependant of a points based  migrant
       and his application was considered under paragraph 319C  HC  395.  On
       April 8, 2013 the respondent refused this application.


    3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 82(1)
       of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on April 29, 2013
       and the respondent reviewed the decision on  September  3,  2013.  On
       January 9, 2014 Judge of the First Tier Tribunal Saffer  (hereinafter
       referred to as the  "FtTJ")  heard  his  appeal  and  allowed  it  in
       determination promulgated on January 14, 2014.


    4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on January 20,  2014  and  on
       May  15  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Chochan  granted
       permission to appeal finding it arguable the FtTJ had possibly  erred
       by taking into  account  documentary  evidence  that  post-dated  the
       decision and as it  was  a  points  based  application  he  had  been
       precluded from doing so pursuant to Section 85A of the 2002 Act.


    5. The matter was originally listed on August 4, 2014 but  this  hearing
       was adjourned until September 23, 2014. The sponsor, Bridget  Odunayo
       Wale Akinlua, requested a further adjournment by letter and this  was
       refused. The matter came before Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley on that
       date and he adjourned the matter as he was not satisfied the  sponsor
       was aware her application to adjourn had been refused. In  adjourning
       it he noted the accounts did not appear to have sufficient funds  and
       he felt it would be reasonable to give the sponsor an opportunity  to
       explain the situation.


    6. On November 10, 2014 the sponsor failed to attend and  at  11.45am  I
       called the case on.


  SUBMISSIONS


    7. Mr McVeety submitted the FtTJ had erred because there was no evidence
       that the bank statements considered by the FtTJ  had  been  submitted
       with the application. They had been faxed to the  Tribunal  on  April
       23, 2013 which was after the application had been  refused  and  were
       attached to the grounds of appeal. He submitted Section  85A  of  the
       2002 Act prevented the FtTJ from taking into account  such  documents
       and in particular he was prevented from having  regard  to  the  bank
       statements contained at pages [26] and [31] of  the  April  23,  2013
       fax. He invited me to find an error in law and to dismiss the appeal.




    8. I reserved my decision.




  MY FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW


    9. The appellant submitted an application to  join  his  spouse  in  the
       United Kingdom. Bank. Some bank  statements  were  submitted  but  in
       order to meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  and  in  particular
       paragraph 319C(g) and Appendix E (i)(g) and (j) HC 395 the  appellant
       had to provide evidence there were sufficient funds in an account  he
       had access to for a period of ninety days


   10. The sponsor failed to attend the original hearing and did not  appear
       before me so I have had to consider the respondent's appeal based  on
       Mr McVeety's submissions and what appears on the file.


   11. I was not satisfied all of the bank statements presented to the  FtTJ
       were in  fact  submitted  with  the  application.  I  have  carefully
       examined the file and I accept Mr McVeety's submission that at  least
       two of the relevant statements were not before  the  entry  clearance
       officer. These documents can be found at pages 26 and 31 of  the  fax
       sent on April  23,  2013.  These  documents  show  funds  of  ï¿½21,000
       appearing in one bank account and then appearing in  another  account
       and remaining. It is these documents the appellant needed to  satisfy
       the Rules.


   12. There was no explanation from the appellant/sponsor and  taking  into
       account my own examination of the file and Mr McVeety's submissions I
       find the appellant did not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 319C
       and the FtTJ erred in allowing  the  appeal  based  on  post-decision
       evidence.


   13. Section 85A(4) of the 2002  Act   clearly  states  the  Tribunal  may
       consider evidence adduced by the appellant only if it-


        a. was submitted in support of, and at  the  time  of  making,  the
           application to which the immigration decision related,
        b. relates to the appeal in so far as it relies  on  grounds  other
           than those specified in subsection (3)(c),
        c. is adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid, or
        d. is adduced in connection with the Secretary of State's  reliance
           on a discretion under immigration rules, or  compliance  with  a
           requirement of immigration rules, to refuse  an  application  on
           grounds not related to the acquisition  of  "points"  under  the
           "Points Based System".


   14. The evidence submitted with the appeal notice filled  in  the  "gaps"
       and consequently the FtTJ should not have had regard to it.


   15. I therefore find there has been an error in law and I set  aside  the
       FtTJ's decision.




  FINDINGS AND REASONS


   16. In light of Section 85A of the 2002 Act I do not admit the additional
       evidence and I therefore find the appellant has failed to satisfy the
       Immigration Rules.


   17. Although article 8 ECHR was raised in the grounds of  appeal  neither
       the sponsor nor the appellant advanced any article 8 ECHR arguments.


   18. The failure by the sponsor to attend  the  hearing  on  two  separate
       occasions is extremely worrying and does not support any  claim  that
       there is subsisting family life.


   19. There is no evidence that the appellant  would  satisfy  Appendix  FM
       and/or paragraph. In the circumstances there is  nothing  exceptional
       or compelling that would make refusing entry clearance  unjustifiably
       harsh or disproportionate.


   20. The appellant has a simple solution  to  the  current  situation.  He
       needs to provide evidence that demonstrates the Immigration Rules are
       met and in such circumstances his appeal is likely to be allowed.


  DECISION


   21. There was a material error of law. The original decision is set aside
       and I dismiss the appeal under both the immigration rules and article
       8 ECHR


   22. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008
       (as amended) the appellant can be granted anonymity throughout  these
       proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise.
       No order has been made and no request for an order was  submitted  to
       me.
