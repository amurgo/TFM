                                     and

               THE SECRETARy OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Ell, Counsel instructed by Turpin & Miller


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. An anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  Unless and
    until a Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, the appellant is granted
    anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly
    identify him or any other member of his family. This direction applies
    both to the appellant and to the respondent.


 2. The appellant in the appeal before me is the Secretary of State for the
    Home Department ("SSHD") and the respondent to this appeal is IA.
    However, for ease of reference, in the course of this decision I adopt
    the parties' status as it was before the FtT.  I refer to IA as the
    appellant, and the SSHD as the respondent.


 3. The appellant is a national of Ghana.  It is not known when and how he
    entered the United Kingdom.  In October 2000, Britannia Legal Advice
    Centre made an application for indefinite leave to remain on his behalf
    under the 'Regularisation Scheme' for over stayers.  The appellant
    claimed to have entered the UK in January 1987 but was unable to
    provide any evidence to support that claim.  He failed to respond to an
    'Immigration Questionnaire' and his application was refused by the
    respondent on 24th of March 2003.  In March 2015, the applicant was
    convicted at Blackfriars Crown Court of theft from a person. He
    received a six-month term of imprisonment. In January 2019, he was
    convicted at Warwick Crown Court of nine offences of dishonesty that
    took place in 2016. He received a 30-month sentence of imprisonment for
    each count, to run concurrently.


 4. On 25th February 2019 the appellant was informed that in light of his
    convictions he is liable automatic deportation in accordance with
    s32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007, unless one of the exceptions apply.
    The appellant made representations on the same date and on 17th May
    2019, a deportation order was signed.  The appellant was served with a
    decision to refuse the human rights claim dated 17th May 2019.  The
    appellant's appeal against that decision was heard by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hollingworth on 15th October 2019 and allowed for
    reasons set out in a decision promulgated on 5th November 2019.


 5. The appellant has three children, all of whom are British citizens.
    The eldest child, [A] was born on 16th April 2007 and is now 12 years
    old.  She lives with her mother, and FtT Judge Hollingworth found at
    paragraph [12] of his decision, that the appellant has not established
    that he has a genuine and subsisting relationship with her.  As set out
    at paragraph [12] of the decision, the focus was upon the appellant's
    two sons, [JE] born on 16th March 2016 and [JA] born on 16th October
    2018.  They are the two children of the appellant's relationship with
    his partner [DN].  At paragraphs [13] to [18] of his decision, the
    judge refers to the evidence before the Tribunal from the appellant's
    partner, an independent social worker Keith Patrick and Dr Aggarwal,
    particularly concerning the health of [JE], who has speech and language
    difficulties and the appellant's partner, who had developed postnatal
    depression and is still suffering with depression, treated by
    medication.  At paragraph [17], the judge found that it is
    unquestionably in the best interests of [JE] and [JA] for them to grow
    up in a household where both parents are present.  At paragraph [18],
    the judge found that separation of [JE] from the appellant would be
    harsh. However, the judge noted the question to be resolved is whether
    the degree of harshness goes beyond what would necessarily be involved
    for a child of a foreign criminal facing deportation. The judge found
    the appellant has established that it would be unduly harsh for the
    children to remain in the UK without the appellant and the immigration
    rules are met.   The judge concluded, at paragraph [23] as follows:


         "I find that family life exists between the appellant and [JE].  I
         find the first four criteria in Razgar are met. The question arises
         as to proportionality. I recognise the importance of the
         maintenance of effective immigration controls. I have also
         considered the PNC. I find that the appellant has a very poor
         criminal record. It is necessary for there to be deterrence. It is
         necessary to express the revulsion of the public. I take into
         account the assessment in the OASyS Report of the risk of
         reoffending. The appellant can speak English. The appellant is not
         financially self-sufficient. I have found undue harshness. The
         exception in relation to [JE] pursuant to Section 117C is
         fulfilled. It is necessary to view proportionality and the question
         of whether there would be a breach of Article 8 through the lens of
         the immigration rules. They are specifically drafted. Having found
         the immigration rules to have been met for the reasons given and
         taking into account the conclusions reached from the application of
         s55 as a primary consideration I have reached the conclusion that
         there would be a breach of the Article 8 right to a family life on
         the part of [JE] and on the part of the appellant. I allow the
         appeal."


 6. The respondent claims the judge erred by failing to consider whether
    there could be other possibilities for [JE]'s behaviour, which
    following referral to a speech therapist is said to be improving, as is
    the mental health of [DN] and the situation at home generally. The
    respondent claims the judge failed to consider whether [JE]'s behaviour
    is attributable simply to his age and his speech and language
    difficulties.  The fact that the behaviour of [JE] has become apparent
    following the incarceration of the appellant, is more likely than not
    to be explained by his age because [JE] would have been too young for
    it to have been recognised previously. The respondent claims the
    evidence establishes that [DN] receives weekly support visits that
    would continue if the appellant is removed, and [DN] would be able to
    continue to utilise the professional help and support available for
    [JE].  The respondent claims the appellant has failed to establish that
    it would be unduly harsh for the children to remain in the UK without
    the appellant.  The respondent refers to the decisions of the Court of
    Appeal in PG (Jamaica) -v- SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1213 and the Supreme
    Court in KO (Nigeria) -v- SSHD [2018] UKSC 53, and claim there has to
    be something above and beyond the normal consequences of deportation,
    but judge has failed to provide valid reasons to demonstrate that it
    would be unduly harsh for the children to remain in the UK without the
    appellant.


 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Woodcraft
    on 3rd December 2019.  Judge Woodcraft observed that arguably, the
    judge has failed to distinguish 'harshness' from 'undue harshness', an
    issue on which there has been substantial Court of Appeal authority.
    The matter comes before me to determine whether the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal is vitiated by a material error of law, and if so,
    to remake the decision.


 8. Mrs Aboni relies upon the grounds of appeal and submits the judge gives
    inadequate reasons for his finding that it would be unduly harsh for
    the children to remain in the UK without the appellant.  She submits
    the judge has failed to consider the high threshold that must be met.
    She submits that although there is evidence of a change in the
    behaviour of [JE] following the incarceration of the appellant, the
    judge failed to consider whether there were other reasons for that
    change in behaviour.  [JE] undoubtedly has speech and language
    difficulties and that is capable of explaining the difficulties that
    [JE] has.  She referred to the report of the independent social worker,
    which confirms, at page 3, that [JE] has no physical health problems
    but has developed behavioural problems, which as yet remain
    undiagnosed. The independent social worker records that in discussion
    with the Deputy Manager of the nursery attended by [JE], he was told
    that [JE] joined the nursery in April 2018 and has settled well. The
    independent social worker was told that [JE] has "... behavioural
    issues within the nursery that they feel are as a result of [JE]'s
    speech and language difficulties that leave him frustrated...".  Mrs
    Aboni submits that although there is an indication that [DN] was
    struggling to manage the behaviour, there is also evidence that [JE]'s
    behaviour is improving, as is [DN]'s mental health.  Mrs Aboni submits
    the judge gives inadequate reasons for finding that the removal of the
    appellant would have an unduly harsh impact upon the children.


 9. Mr Ell submits the decision was one that was open to the judge and the
    matters now relied upon by the respondent amount to a disagreement with
    the findings and conclusions reached.  He submits the judge was
    referred to the relevant legal framework and that is properly set out
    by the judge at paragraphs [9] to [11] of the decision.  Mr Ell submits
    that at paragraph [18], the judge found that "... quite plainly
    separation of [JE] from the appellant would be harsh.".  However, the
    judge properly noted in the following sentence that the question to be
    resolved is whether the degree of harshness goes beyond what would
    necessarily be involved for any child of a foreign criminal facing
    deportation.  The judge properly directed himself that the test is
    whether it is 'unduly harsh'.  The judge accepted the evidence of the
    appellant's partner [DN] and her evidence that [JE]'s behaviour had
    taken a sudden change for the worse since the appellant had gone to
    prison.  Mr Ell submits the judge carefully considered all the evidence
    that was before the Tribunal and at  paragraph [18], the judge
    identified the factors that taken cumulatively, explain his conclusion
    that it would be unduly harsh for the children to remain in the UK
    without the appellant.


Discussion


10. Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 defines a foreign criminal, as a
    person not a British citizen who is convicted in the UK of an offence
    and, inter alia, sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12
    months. Section 32(4) of the 2007 Act sets outs out the clear
    proposition that deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the
    public good. That is a statement of public policy enacted by the
    legislature, which the courts and tribunals are obliged to respect.
    Section 32(5) of the 2007 Act requires the Secretary of State to make a
    deportation order in respect of every foreign criminal, subject to the
    exceptions set out in section 33.  Insofar as is relevant that is:


         "(2) Exception 1 is where removal of the foreign criminal in
         pursuance of the deportation order would breach-


             (a)  a person's Convention rights, or


             (b)  the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee
             Convention.


         ...


         (7) The application of an exception-


             (a)  does not prevent the making of a deportation order;


             (b)  results in it being assumed neither that deportation of
             the person concerned is conducive to the public good nor that
             it is not conducive to the public good;


         but section 32(4) applies despite the application of Exception 1 or
         4.".


11. Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 NIAA 2002
    informs the decision making in relation to the application of the
    section 33 exceptions. Section 117A in Part 5A provides that, when a
    court or tribunal is required to determine whether a decision made
    under the Immigration Acts breaches a person's right to respect for
    private and family life under Article 8, and, as a result, would be
    unlawful under section 6 of the HRA 1998, the court, in considering the
    public interest question, must (in particular) have regard to the
    considerations listed in section 117B and, additionally, in cases
    concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to the considerations
    listed in section 117C.  Applying s117C(3) of the 2002 Act, the public
    interest required the appellant's deportation unless Exceptions 1 or 2
    set out in s.117C(4) and (5) apply.


12. With specific reference to Exception 2 in S.117C(5), Lord Carnwath in
    KO (Nigeria) observed, at paragraph 23:


         "The expression "unduly harsh" seems clearly intended to introduce
         a higher hurdle than that of "reasonableness" under section
         117B(6), taking account of the public interest in the deportation
         of foreign criminals. Further the word "unduly" implies an element
         of comparison. It assumes that there is a "due" level of
         "harshness", that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable
         in the relevant context. "Unduly" implies something going beyond
         that level. The relevant context is that set by section 117C(1),
         that is the public interest in the deportation of foreign
         criminals. One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond
         what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the
         deportation of a parent. What it does not require in my view (and
         subject to the discussion of the cases in the next section) is a
         balancing of relative levels of severity of the parent's offence,
         other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the section
         itself by reference to length of sentence. Nor (contrary to the
         view of the Court of Appeal in IT (Jamaica) v Secretary of State
         for the Home Department [2017] 1 WLR 240, paras 55 and 64) can it
         be equated with a requirement to show "very compelling reasons".
         That would be in effect to replicate the additional test applied by
         section 117C(6) with respect to sentences of four years or more.".


13. In SSHD v PG (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 1213, Holroyde LJ said, at
    paragraph 34:


         "It is therefore now clear that a tribunal or court considering
         section 117C(5) of the 2002 Act must focus, not on the comparative
         seriousness of the offence or offences committed by the foreign
         criminal who faces deportation, but rather, on whether the effects
         of his deportation on a child or partner would go beyond the degree
         of harshness which would necessarily be involved for any child or
         partner of a foreign criminal faced with deportation. Pursuant to
         Rule 399, the tribunal or court must consider both whether it would
         be unduly harsh for the child and/or partner to live in the country
         to which the foreign criminal is to be deported and whether it
         would be unduly harsh for the child and/or partner to remain in the
         UK without him."


14. At paragraph 38, Holroyde LJ further observed:


         "In the circumstances of this appeal, I do not think it necessary
         to refer to decisions predating KO (Nigeria), because it is no
         longer appropriate, when considering section 117C(5) of the 2002
         Act, to balance the severity of the consequences for SAT and the
         children of PG's deportation against the seriousness of his
         offending. The issue is whether there was evidence on which it was
         properly open to Judge Griffith to find that deportation of PG
         would result for SAT and/or the children in a degree of harshness
         going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any partner or
         child of a foreign criminal facing deportation.".


15. The respondent accepts the appellant has a genuine and subsisting
    parental relationship with his children who are all British citizens.
    The question to be resolved was whether the degree of harshness goes
    beyond what would necessarily be involved for a child of a foreign
    criminal facing deportation. At paragraphs [14] and [15], the judge
    carefully considers the evidence of the appellant's partner [DN], and
    the evidence set out in the report of the independent social worker and
    the letter from Dr Aggarwal.  The evidence concerns not only the health
    of [JE] and [DN] and the particular challenges that they face, but also
    the cumulative impact that those challenges have upon the family
    dynamics as a whole, and the ability of [DN] to properly care for [JA]
    too.


16. At paragraph [18] of his decision, the judge identifies a number of
    factors that taken cumulatively, establish a degree of harshness going
    beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child of a foreign
    criminal facing deportation.  In particular, the judge noted:


      a. [JE]'s behavioural difficulties swiftly followed the incarceration
         of his father and the behavioural difficulties at home have been
         extreme.


      b. [JE] has demonstrated poor eating behaviour which began following
         the incarceration of the appellant.


      c. [JE] requires the full support of his mother at his age, and that
         support is prejudiced by the depression from which [DN] suffers,
         and the degree of difficulty which she now faces arising from the
         cumulative impact of the factors identified in her evidence and in
         the report of the independent social worker.


      d. The speech and language difficulties of [JE] have arisen after the
         appellant's incarceration.


      e. [JE] has experienced hallucinations and vomiting that has been
         treated by the medical profession on a physical basis but form an
         additional dimension to what would necessarily be involved for any
         child of a foreign criminal facing deportation.


      f. The emotional dependency of [JE] upon his father substantially
         exceeds the normal emotional ties to be expected between a child of
         [JE]'s age and the appellant.


17. In reaching his decision the judge plainly had in mind the improvements
    which had been noted in the report of the independent social worker.
    In my judgment, in reaching his decision, the judge clearly applied the
    correct test.  Where a judge applies the correct test, and that results
    in an arguably generous conclusion, it does not mean that it was
    erroneous in law.


18. As the Court of Appeal said at [18] of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ
    412, it is necessary to guard against the temptation to characterise as
    errors of law what are in truth no more than disagreements about the
    weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge who
    decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence. The
    assessment of such a claim is always a highly fact sensitive task.  The
    FtT judge was required to consider the evidence as a whole and he
    plainly did so, giving adequate reasons for his decision.  The findings
    and conclusions reached by the judge are neither irrational nor
    unreasonable.  The decision was one that was open to the judge on the
    evidence before him and the findings made.


19. It follows that I dismiss the appeal.


Decision:


20. The appeal is dismissed and the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Hollingworth, stands.
