Representation

Appellant:    Mr S Knafler QC and Mr A Grigg  (of  Counsel),  instructed  by
             Wilson Solicitors LLP

Respondent:   Mr D Blundell, of Counsel, instructed by the Government  Legal
             Department

 i)  There  is  no  hierarchy  of  weight  or  importance  in  the  various
    considerations recited in regulation 21(6) of the EEA Regulations.  The
    weight to be attributed to each factor will vary according to the  fact
    sensitive context of the individual case.

ii) Where it is contended that the decision  maker  and/or  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) has acted in contravention of section 55 of the Borders,
    Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009,  the  Upper   Tribunal   will
    scrutinise the degree of engagement with all material evidence and,  in
    particular, will search for clear findings in the decision of  the  FtT
    of what the best interests of any affected child are.

iii) Article 24(3) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights  creates  a  free
    standing right (although not absolute).

iv) Where this right is engaged, a failure by the decision maker and/or the
    FtT to acknowledge it  and  to  decide  accordingly  may  constitute  a
    material error of law.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This appeal has its origins  in  a  decision  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (the "Secretary of  State"),
    dated 12 December 2013, to make an order deporting the  Appellant  from
    the United Kingdom.   By its decision promulgated on 03 March 2015, the
    First-tier  Tribunal  (the  "FtT")  dismissed   the   ensuing   appeal.
    Permission to appeal to this Tribunal was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Rintoul in the following terms:

         "It is arguable that the [FtT] erred in failing, in the context  of
         an appeal  under  the  EEA  Regulations,  to  have  regard  to  the
         provisions of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .....


         Permission is granted on all grounds."

 2. The effect of the grant of permission to appeal is that there  are  two
    issues to be determined:

    (i)  Did the FtT err  in  law  by  failing  to  conduct  (adopting  the
         Appellant's  formulation)  a  composite  proportionality   exercise
         and/or, in particular, by failing to properly  recognise  and  give
         substantial weight to the Appellant's long residence in the  United
         Kingdom and integration in United Kingdom society?

    (ii) Did the FtT err in law by failing to consider Article 24(3) of the
         Charter of Fundamental Rights of the  European  Union  (hereinafter
         "the Charter")?

 3. I have been assisted by a detailed chronology  of  material  dates  and
    events prepared by the Appellant's representatives.  This  is  attached
    as Appendix 1. In very brief compass,  the  Appellant,  a  national  of
    Nigeria, is now aged 41 years and has been continuously  resident  here
    since aged 16.  He has two daughters, both British  citizens,  who  are
    aged 13 and 11 years respectively.  He has been convicted of  a  series
    of fraud offences, beginning in 2002 and subsequently in 2003, 2006 and
    2012.  In 2006, the convicting court made a deportation recommendation.
     Following a series of subsequent  challenges,  the  Appellant  avoided
    deportation and, in February 2011, he acquired  a  residence  card  qua
    family member  of  an  EEA  national.    His  offending  has  attracted
    custodial sentences, most recently (in January 2012) a sentence of 4  ï¿½
    years imprisonment.  This was the impetus for the Secretary of  State's
    impugned decision.

Statutory Framework

 4. The Secretary of State's decision was made under the framework  of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (the   "EEA
    Regulations").  Within Part 4 of  this  measure  there  are  provisions
    relating to the exclusion  and  removal  of  persons  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  Regulation 19(3) provides:

         "Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), an EEA national who has entered
         the United Kingdom or the family member of such a national who  has
         entered the United Kingdom may be removed if-


           (a) that person does not have or ceases to have a right to
           reside under these Regulations;


           (b) the Secretary of State has decided that the person's removal
           is justified on grounds of public policy, public security or
           public health in accordance with regulation 21; or


           (c) the Secretary of State has decided that the person's removal
           is justified on grounds of abuse of rights in accordance with
           regulation 21B(2)."

    The discrete topic of decisions taken on public policy, public security
    and  public  health  grounds  is  addressed  in  regulation  21,  which
    provides, in material part:


         "(1) In this regulation a "relevant decision" means an EEA decision
         taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
         health.

         (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.


         (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15 except on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.


         (4) A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-


           (a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of
           at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or


           (b) is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision is
           necessary in his best interests, as provided for in the
           Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by the General
           Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989.


         (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
         or public security it shall, in addition to complying with the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken in accordance
         with the following principles-


           (a) the decision must comply with the principle of
           proportionality;


           (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal
           conduct of the person concerned;


           (c) the personal conduct of the person concerned must represent
           a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one
           of the fundamental interests of society;


           (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which
           relate to considerations of general prevention do not justify
           the decision;


           (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not in
           themselves justify the decision.


         (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who is resident
         in the United Kingdom the decision maker must take account of
         considerations such as the age, state of health, family and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's links with
         his country of origin."

    It is common case that regulation  21(3)  applies  to  this  Appellant.
    Thus it was incumbent on the Secretary of State to address the standard
    of "serious grounds of public policy or  public  security"  and  decide
    accordingly.

First Ground of Appeal

 5. The argument developed by Mr Knafler QC on behalf of the Appellant  had
    several inter-related strands.  It was submitted that the FtT failed to
    properly analyse all material factors and,  thus,  failed  to  adopt  a
    composite approach in the proportionality exercise;  did  not  properly
    recognise  the  strength  of  the  Appellant's   long   residence   and
    integration in the United Kingdom  and,  therefore,  failed  to  accord
    these factors  the  requisite  weight;  conducted  an  inadequate  best
    interests of children assessment; and, in breach of  the  principle  of
    equal treatment (or consistency of outcomes), reached an outcome  which
    does not bear comparison with other cases.

 6. In  the  now  well  developed  jurisprudence  relating  to  deportation
    decisions under the EEA Regulations, certain general principles can  be
    readily identified.  In Land Baden - Wurttenberg v Tsakouridis [2011] 2
    CMLR 11, the issue of integration featured with some prominence in  the
    decision of the Court of Justice of the European  Union  (CJEU),  which
    stated:

         "[24]    According to recital  23  in  the  preamble  to  Directive
         2004/38, the expulsion of Union citizens and their  family  members
         on grounds of public policy or public security can  seriously  harm
         persons who, having availed themselves of the rights  and  freedoms
         conferred on them by the Treaty, have become  genuinely  integrated
         into the host Member State.


         [25] That is why Directive 2004/38, as follows from recital  24  in
         the preamble, establishes a system of protection against  expulsion
         measures which is based on  the  degree  of  integration  of  those
         persons in the host Member State, so that the greater the degree of
         integration of Union citizens and their family members in the  host
         Member  State,  the  greater  the  degree  of  protection   against
         expulsion should be.

         [26] In this context, Article  28(1)  of  that  directive  provides
         generally that, before taking an expulsion decision on  grounds  of
         public policy or public security, the host Member State  must  take
         account in particular  of  considerations  such  as  how  long  the
         individual concerned has resided on its territory, his or her  age,
         state of health, family and economic situation, social and cultural
         integration into the host Member State and the extent of his or her
         links with the country of origin.


         [27] Under Article 28(2), Union citizens or their  family  members,
         irrespective of  nationality,  who  have  the  right  of  permanent
         residence in the territory of the host  Member  State  pursuant  to
         Article 16 of the directive cannot be the subject of  an  expulsion
         decision 'except on serious grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
         security'.


         [28] In the case of Union citizens who have  resided  in  the  host
         Member State for the previous 10 years, Article 28(3) of  Directive
         2004/38 considerably strengthens their protection against expulsion
         by providing that such a measure may not be taken except where  the
         decision is based on 'imperative grounds  of  public  security,  as
         defined by Member States'."

    As this decision and others make clear, one  of  the  purposes  of  the
    underlying measure of EU Law, Directive  2004/38/EC  (the  "Citizenship
    Directive") was to establish a more prescriptive regime in the realm of
    expulsion and removal, containing appropriate safeguards for the person
    concerned.

 7. Mr Knafler's submissions placed particular reliance on two decisions of
    the United Kingdom courts.  The first is B v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2000] EWCA Civ 158, another deportation case in  which
    the Appellant, an Italian national aged 45, had  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom since aged 7.  The Secretary of State proposed  to  deport  the
    Appellant  on  the  ground  that  he  had  subjected  his  daughter  to
    "prolonged and systematic child abuse" between the ages of  12  and  18
    years, giving rise to a punishment  of  five  years  imprisonment:  see
    [19].  The evidence was that he had a propensity to  re-offend,  albeit
    restricted by limited opportunity.   Delivering  the  judgment  of  the
    Court, Sedley LJ described the Appellant's 38 years  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom as a "factor of real weight": see [35].  He continued:

         "What  in  my  judgment  renders  deportation  a   disproportionate
         response to this appellant's offending, serious as it  is,  and  to
         his propensity to offend such as it may now be, is the fact that it
         will take him from the country in which he has grown up, has  lived
         his whole adult life  and  has  such  social  relationships  as  he
         possesses.  It would  negate  both  his  freedom  of  movement  and
         respect for his private life in the one place, the United  Kingdom,
         where these have real meaning for him."

     See [37].

    While the Court acknowledged that the  Secretary  of  State's  decision
    would  withstand  an  irrationality  challenge  based   on   Wednesbury
    principles, it concluded that the decision was unlawful on  the  ground
    that it was disproportionate in both EU law and ECHR (Article 8) terms.
     Ward LJ and Simon Brown LJ expressed their views  in  essentially  the
    same terms.

 8. Mr Knafler also relied on the decision of the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal (AIT)  in  LG  and  CC  (EEA  Regs:  residence;  imprisonment;
    removal) Italy [2009] UKAIT 00024, a case involving regulation 21(4) of
    the EEA Regulations.  There it was held that the tribunal had erred  in
    law  in  applying  the  highest  level  of  protection.   The  decision
    continues, at [116]:

         "However, even if one judges their reasoning by  reference  to  the
         second level of protection .....  they erred in our view in failing
         to consider the particular circumstances of LG's position, his long
         residence in this country, including more than ten years  residence
         before any offences were committed  and  his  lack  of  links  with
         Italy."

         The effect in law of this failing was assessed thus, at [117]:

         "This failure  meant  that  the  second  Tribunal's  assessment  of
         proportionality  was   fatally   flawed.    In   our   view,   even
         acknowledging the seriousness of  the  offence  in  2000,  and  the
         possible risk of re-offending, we do not think that expulsion is  a
         proportionate response for someone who came here as  a  child,  has
         acquired a right of permanent residence in this country, has  lived
         here for some 15 years before the crime was committed  and  has  no
         significant links with Italy.  In such a case we think that  public
         policy considerations should carry little weight."

         The appeal of LG was allowed accordingly.

 9. As noted above, one discrete limb of this ground of appeal concerns the
    best interests of children assessment carried  out  by  the  FtT.   The
    arguments on behalf of the Appellant  reminded  this  Tribunal  of  its
    decision in JO and Others (section 55 duty)  Nigeria  [2014]  UKUT  517
    (IAC) and, in particular,  the  duty  imposed  by  section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 (the "2009 Act")  on  the
    decision maker (in the first instance) and the tribunal (on appeal)  to
    identify all facts and factors bearing on the  best  interests  of  any
    affected child.  To this I would add that the  next  step  is  to  make
    clear findings relating to  the  child's  best  interests.   These  are
    essential  pre-requisites  to  a  proper  balancing  of  all   factors,
    including the public interest, in  the  proportionality  exercise.   In
    this context, the parties'  submissions  also  drew  attention  to  the
    decision of this Tribunal in MK (section 55 - Tribunal options)  Sierra
    Leone [2015] UKUT 00223 (IAC).

10. Peart v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 568,
    another decision to which Mr  Knafler  directed  my  attention,  is  an
    illustration of an assessment by the Court of Appeal that the  tribunal
    below erred in its  application  of  section  55  in  failing  to  give
    sufficient consideration to what was in the child's best  interests  or
    to give the child's welfare the degree of importance  it  merited:  see
    [15].  The second error of law  identified  by  the  Court  of  Appeal,
    namely the tribunal's failure to assess the  totality  of  the  factors
    bearing on the Appellant's family and private life and "to consider the
    overall significance of the different individual relationships" in play
    (see [16] - [17]), is also worthy of note.   I observe that  these  are
    plainly fact sensitive.

11. The submissions of Mr Blundell on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    highlighted the importance of considering the decision of  the  FtT  in
    substance and as a whole, in accordance with  the  exhortation  of  the
    Court of Appeal in AD Lee v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2011] EWCA Civ 348 at [17]:

         "[Counsel] criticises the form in which the Judge has expressed his
         conclusion ...


         He contends that  it  prioritises  the  case  for  deportation  and
         considers only whether the impact on the family is so great  as  to
         outweigh it, when it ought to be  approaching  the  issues  in  the
         opposite order, prioritising [his client's]  interests  and  asking
         whether they are outweighed by the case for deportation.  It  seems
         to us that, at least in the present context, this is  a  matter  of
         form, not of substance .....


         Provided both the child's interests and the  case  for  deportation
         have been properly appraised, the question  whether  one  outweighs
         the other can be approached from either direction."

    Mr Blundell further  submitted  that  the  exercise  of  comparing  the
    factual frameworks of different cases urged  on  the  Tribunal  by  the
    Appellant is inappropriate.  He  also  reminded  the  Tribunal  of  the
    decision in EO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    [2014] EWCA Civ 1418 at [8].  Mr Blundell's central submission  on  the
    first ground of appeal, in substance, resolved to the  contention  that
    this Tribunal should guard against the temptation of microanalysis  and
    excessive forensic examination of the decision of the FtT.

12. There is one piece of evidence which has a particular bearing  on  this
    ground of appeal, namely the report of the independent  social  worker,
    to which I now turn.  This report was received in  paper  form  by  the
    FtT.  Based  on  interviews  of  all  of  the  protagonists   and   the
    consideration of other materials, the report  focuses  particularly  on
    the relationship between the Appellant and his younger  daughter,  aged
    11  years.   It  contains  the  following  material   assessments   and
    conclusions:

    (a)  While children form attachments to any consistent care  giver  who
          is sensitive and responsive  in  their  social  interactions  with
          them, the quality of the social engagement is more influential  in
          developing that attachment than the amount of time spent.  In  the
          Appellant's case, the quality of his interaction with his daughter
          when they are together is so positive and  involves  such  a  high
          degree of  involvement  that  their  relationship  has  grown  and
          flourished in consequence.

       b) The Appellant has taken positive steps to initiate a  relationship
          between his daughter and her half-sister  (the  Appellant's  older
          daughter, aged 13).


       c)  The  Appellant  and  this  daughter   have   "a   strong,   close
          relationships and (that) their relationship is both meaningful and
          valuable to both of them".

       d) This  relationship  is  extremely  important  to  the  Appellant's
          daughter who ".... sees what he offers her in terms  of  emotional
          and psychological support  as  being  essential  to  her  positive
          functioning and complementing, not duplicating,  what  her  mother
          offers".

       e) The Appellant "....  has consciously thought about the  manner  of
          his interaction with [his daughter] as she  has  grown  older  and
          more mature .... [she] is  very  emotionally  and  psychologically
          dependent on her father presently, because of all he  is  able  to
          offer her".

       f) The loss of the Appellant from his daughter's life would be  "very
          psychologically difficult to manage and  ....  would  be  like  an
          abandonment to her".

       g) Research establishes the importance of the continued presence of a
          person  contributing  substantially   to   a   child's   emotional
          stability, security and self-esteem.

       h)  Research  further  demonstrates  that  the  deportation  of   the
          Appellant would render his daughter more likely to show  signs  of
          depression and experience  feelings  of  loss  and  sadness.  Long
          distance contact would be no substitute.

       i)  Research  also  establishes  the   phenomenon   of   "significant
          behavioural changes amongst  most  children  who  had  experienced
          parental deportation ..."

       j) Such children have "a consistently lower score  on  a  variety  of
          moral indexes."

       k) Moreover, such children "...  are, on average, more likely  to  be
          academic under-achievers .... more likely to experience  behaviour
          problems at school such as having difficulty paying  attention  or
          being disobedient ...."

       l) The extreme distress which the Appellant's daughter is  likely  to
          suffer in consequence of his deportation "... will endure in  some
          form beyond the immediate and medium term" and is unlikely  to  be
          adequately managed by her mother, giving  rise  to  a  deleterious
          impact on this relationship also.

    This report was not challenged by any other evidence.

13. In its decision, the  FtT,  in  summarising  the  documentary  evidence
    available to it, referred to the aforementioned report and quoted  from
    certain passages which have a correlation to parts of [12] above.  In a
    later passage, in its consideration of the best interests  of  children
    issue, the FtT stated:

         "[The  report]  ...  refers  to  academic  research   showing   the
         importance  of  children  maintaining  a  relationship  with  their
         fathers.  The Presenting Officer accepts that this would be in  the
         best interests of both [children].  I too accept that but, even  if
         the Appellant were to remain living in the UK, the  Appellant  will
         not be able to maintain an active and  positive  relationship  with
         his daughters if he resumes a  life  of  crime  and  risks  further
         lengthy terms of imprisonment.  There is a significant risk of  him
         continuing to do so and  this  must  be  taken  into  account  when
         assessing  the  impact  of  his  deportation.  Conversely  if   the
         Appellant  relocates  to  Nigeria,  he  does  have  the  option  of
         maintaining the relationship through regular indirect  contact  via
         Skype etc".


         [my emphasis]

    At this point of its decision, the FtT's assessment of  the  children's
    best interests terminates  and  the  Judge  embarks  upon  a  balancing
    exercise and the formulation of a series of conclusions.  These include
    a recognition that the Appellant's departure from  the  United  Kingdom
    would have an (unspecified) "adverse impact" on the children.  This  is
    followed by the statement in the concluding paragraph:


         "....  The family life of the Appellant and that  of  his  children
         will be placed in some jeopardy by his removal  and  the  potential
         effect on the children is undoubtedly the strongest factor  in  his
         favour."


         [Emphasis added.]

14. In my judgment, the FtT failed to engage properly with the  assessments
    and conclusions of the expert concerned. I agree with Mr Blundell that,
    where issues of this kind are concerned, it will rarely be  appropriate
    for an appellate tribunal to conclude that the evidence under  scrutiny
    was simply disregarded by the lower tribunal.  This conclusion  is  not
    open to this Tribunal in the present case, since the judge was  clearly
    aware of the expert report. However, the  best  interests  of  children
    exercise, where it falls  to  be  performed,  is  one  of  unmistakable
    importance and gravity.  It is not enough to pay  lip  service  to  the
    evidence bearing on this issue.  Rather,  an  appellate  tribunal  will
    invariably search for indicators that  the  lower  tribunal  has  fully
    considered the evidence, has understood it  and  has  properly  engaged
    with it. I find no such indicators in  the  present  case.   The  short
    sentence confining the expert  evidence  to  a  rehearsal  of  academic
    research  demonstrating  the  importance  of  children  maintaining  "a
    relationship" between the Appellant and his children with their  father
    fails to satisfy these  elementary  touchstones.   While  the  FtT  was
    probably correct to conclude that "regular indirect contact  via  Skype
    etc" would secure the  aim  of  the  maintenance  of  "a  relationship"
    between the Appellant and his  children,  the  use  of  the  indefinite
    article is striking.  This falls well short of a proper  assessment  of
    the children's best  interests  and,  further,  represents  a  manifest
    dislocation from the detailed and undisputed expert evidence.


15.  Furthermore, the appellate tribunal will always  search  for  a  clear
    formulation, or identification, of the best interests of the  child  or
    children concerned in the decision of the first instance tribunal. This
    should normally be the subject of a  clear  finding  or  findings,  all
    material evidence first having been examined. I consider that this  too
    is lacking in the decision of the FtT.  This  failure  flows  naturally
    from the main shortcoming identified above. Finally, the conclusion  of
    the FtT that the removal of the Appellant from the United Kingdom would
    (merely) place the family life enjoyed by the children and him "in some
    jeopardy" is simply unsustainable.  Their family life, as  enjoyed  and
    experienced by the three persons involved,  would  be  decimated,  left
    hanging by the thread of occasional long distance communications.

16. This analysis impels to the inexorable conclusion  that  the  challenge
    based on section 55 of the 2009 Act  must  succeed.   Furthermore,  the
    materiality of this error of law is beyond plausible dispute, given the
    obvious importance  of  the  children  issues  in  the  proportionality
    assessment.  Accordingly, the Appellant's challenge to the decision  of
    the FtT succeeds.

17. In proceeding to consider the second element the first  ground  of  the
    Appellant's challenge, I consider that the standard in play is that  of
    proportionality.   The   distinction   between   the    standards    of
    proportionality and rationality was highlighted by this Tribunal in its
    recent decision in R (SA) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    (Human Rights Challenges: Correct Approach) IJR [2015] UKUT 536  (IAC),
    at [20] particularly:

         "At this juncture, it is appropriate  to  recall  that  many  human
         rights decisions involve balancing exercises. These are  evaluative
         processes which normally entail weighing the  individual,  personal
         interests of  the  person  concerned  with  some  competing  public
         interest  or  interests.  For  immigration  judges   the   dominant
         Convention right in this respect is Article 8. It is a truism  that
         in a large majority of Article  8  challenges  in  the  immigration
         sphere the question to be determined by the  tribunal  is  that  of
         proportionality, the last of the stages specified in R (Razgar)  v
         SSHD [2004] 2AC 368. In such cases the question for  the  Tribunal
         is not whether the impugned decision is irrational or is vitiated
         by the application of the Wednesbury principles or is procedurally
         unfair or contravenes some other public law standard.  The  correct
         question is, rather, whether the  decision  is  a  disproportionate
         means of pursuing  the  legitimate  aim  in  play.  If  "yes",  the
         conclusion is that the Convention right has been breached: not that
         the  decision  is  unlawful  on  account   of   some   public   law
         misdemeanour."

    Further,  it  is  timely  to  recall  the   correct   approach   in   a
    proportionality assessment.  It involves consideration of the following
    questions:


       i) Is the objective sufficiently  important  to  justify  limitation
          upon a fundamental right?


      ii) Is the measure rationally connected to the objective?

     iii) Could a less intrusive measure have been adopted?

      iv) Has a fair balance been struck between individual rights and  the
          interests of the community?



    See Bank Mellat v HM Treasury (No 2) [2013] UKSC 39, at [20].


18. I refer also to the more recent consideration of  these  principles  by
    the Supreme Court in R (Tigere) v Secretary  of  State  for  Business,
    Innovation and Skills [2015] UKSC 57, at [23]-[33]. Having  regard  to
    the profound reflections  on  proportionality  in  Keyu  and  Others  v
    Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2015] UKSC 69,
    there is clearly scope for further development and  refinement  in  the
    role of the court, or tribunal, in cases involving the  proportionality
    of an interference with a Convention right.

19. This dimension of the Appellant's  challenge  involves  the  submission
    that the FtT erred in law by giving insufficient  weight  to  the  twin
    factors of the Appellant's long residence in the United Kingdom and his
    integration in UK society. I  consider  that,  properly  analysed,  the
    contention formulated by Mr Knafler was that the  FtT  was  obliged  to
    accord greater weight to these two considerations and was thus mandated
    by the decisions in B and LG  and  CC.   It  seems  to  me  that  these
    decisions, at their zenith, go no  further  than  holding  that,  in  a
    particular factual  matrix,  long  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    coupled with a right of permanent residence in one of  the  cases,  may
    qualify for the allocation of significant weight in the proportionality
    balancing exercise.  Thus a lower tribunal could be considered to  have
    erred in law if the appellate court or tribunal, forming its  own  view
    of proportionality, makes this assessment.

20. To summarise, I consider that neither the Court of Appeal in B nor  the
    AIT in LG and CC purported to formulate any legal principle or rule  to
    the effect that the factors of  long  residence  and  integration  must
    invariably attract substantial weight.  My analysis of these  decisions
    is that the Court of Appeal and AIT,  giving  determinative  weight  to
    these stand out factors, decided that deportation was  not  appropriate
    and  necessary  to  its  legitimate  aim  on  the   particular   facts.
    Furthermore,  the  consideration  that  the  appellate  court  was  the
    ultimate arbiter of  proportionality  and  that  proportionality  is  a
    sharper tool than its common law cousin rationality shines brightly  in
    the judgments of the Court of Appeal in B, particularly that of  Sedley
    LJ.  As he noted at [27]:

         "... Once we have taken the primary facts from the IAT, this  is  a
         case in which we are as well placed as that tribunal to decide what
         to make of them."


    This analysis also disposes of the inequality  of  treatment  argument.
    In short, no disparity arises when one is comparing apples with pears.


21. I consider that Mr Knafler's argument on this discrete issue is further
    confounded by  the  statutory  language.   Regulation  21  of  the  EEA
    Regulations imposes two particular duties on  the  Secretary  of  State
    and, on appeal, the  tribunal.   First,  the  principles  enshrined  in
    regulation 21(5) must be applied.  Second,  the  inexhaustive  list  of
    factors in regulation 21(6) must be  considered.   These  include  "the
    person's length of residence in the United Kingdom [and]  the  person's
    social and cultural integration into the  United  Kingdom".   The  duty
    imposed is to consider these factors.  This  mirrors  recital  (23)  of
    Directive 2004/38/EC which, in the context  of  considering  expulsion,
    states:

         "The scope  for  such  measures  should  therefore  be  limited  in
         accordance with the principle of proportionality to take account of
         the degree of integration of the persons concerned, the  length  of
         their residence in the host  Member  State,  their  age,  state  of
         health, family and economic situation  and  the  links  with  their
         country of origin."

     The corresponding substantive provision of  the  Directive  is  Article
    28, which is couched in precisely  the  same  terms.   So  too  is  the
    equivalent part of Regulation 21.

22. I consider that neither  the  Directive  nor  the  transposing  measure
    contains  any  indication  that  the  factors  of  long  residence  and
    integration  automatically  qualify  for  greater  weight  than   other
    material considerations.    Furthermore,  while  the  factors  of  long
    residence and integration are specifically  recognised  in  the  regime
    created, they are the gateway to increased protection against expulsion
    via the higher criteria. To conclude,  I  consider  that  there  is  no
    hierarchy in the weight to be attributed to the  factors  evaluated  in
    the Regulation 21 exercise. The quantum of weight to  be  allocated  to
    each factor will vary according to the fact sensitive nature  of  every
    case.

23. It follows from the above analysis that it is open to this Tribunal, in
    principle, to hold that the decision of the FtT infringes the principle
    of proportionality if it considers that greater weight should have been
    given to the factors of long residence and integration.  This being  an
    Article  8  ECHR   challenge,  I  consider  this  to  be  the   correct
    formulation of the question: to be contrasted with the tests which  one
    would be posing in a judicial review  challenge  or  a  pure  error  of
    domestic law appeal (per Edwards v Bairstow [1956] AC 14)  with  no  EU
    or human rights overlay, that is to  say  (in  shorthand)  whether  the
    decision of the lower tribunal and/or the decision maker is vitiated by
    irrationality  or  a  failure  to  take  into  account   all   material
    considerations or permitting the intrusion of something immaterial,  or
    a combination of any of these vitiating agents.

24. I apply this approach to the decision of the FtT in the following  way.
    The Judge began with the unexceptional self-direction that, pursuant to
    Regulation 21, it was incumbent upon him to consider  factors  such  as
    "(the Appellant's) length of residence in the UK, social  and  cultural
    integration into the UK  ......".  He then noted in particular:

         "The Appellant has resided continuously in the UK since 1990 and he
         has integrated into the UK during that period  in  a  positive  way
         such as through his studies ....."


    Next, the Judge gave consideration to other factors bearing  indirectly
    on the Appellant's connections with the United Kingdom,  in  particular
    his enduring links with family members in Nigeria and his ability to re-
    establish himself in his country of origin if obliged to return  there.
    The Judge then considered the  circumstances  of  the  Appellant's  two
    children  in  the  United  Kingdom.    This   was   followed   by   his
    acknowledgement of a previous positive assessment of the  Appellant  by
    an earlier tribunal  prior  to  his  most  recent  offending.   At  the
    conclusion of these passages, the Judge stated:


         "I conclude that the Appellant's removal is justified under the EEA
         Regulations in the interests of public security."

    He then gave separate consideration to the question of  proportionality
    in the context of Article 8(2) ECHR.  In doing  so,  he  observed  that
    this exercise was one overlapping considerably with that which  he  had
    conducted under regulation 21.  I  consider  that  there  is  indeed  a
    significant merger between these two exercises and the contrary was not
    contended.

25. The ultimate conclusion of the FtT was that the  public  interest  must
    prevail.  The discrete public  interest  engaged  was  that  of  public
    security.  The scales tipped  in  favour  of  the  public  interest  on
    account of the seriousness of the Appellant's offending,  his  role  in
    the offences, the repeated nature  of  his  offending,  the  protracted
    period  during  which  he  had  offended,  his  previous  failures   to
    rehabilitate, his abuse of trust and  his  neglect  of  his  children's
    interests.  Drawing all of these factors together,  the  FtT  concluded
    that the statutory test of "a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
    threat affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society"  was
    satisfied.  This, in the FtT's assessment, outweighed  the  factors  on
    the other side of the scales.  For the reasons given in [14]  and  [15]
    above, I consider the proportionality assessment and conclusion of  the
    FtT to be legally flawed. The flaws identified permeate and infect  the
    exercise in its entirety. While I have rejected the terms in which this
    aspect of the Appellant's challenge was advanced, in this sense and  to
    this  extent  this  discrete  feature  of  the  Appellant's  case  also
    succeeds.

Second ground of appeal:  EU Charter of Fundamental Rights

26. The Charter entered into force, in tandem with the Lisbon Treaty, on 01
    November 2009.  Constitutionally, it  is  one  of  the  three  dominant
    instruments of governance of the EU. Notably, one of  the  recitals  in
    its preamble proclaims the necessity of strengthening the protection of
    fundamental rights.  This is reflected in  its  contents.   Thus  while
    many of its provisions approximate closely to the  European  Convention
    on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the "ECHR"), the reach of the
    Charter is  more  expansive.   In  some  specific  instances,  it  goes
    demonstrably further than the ECHR.  Furthermore, it  enshrines  rights
    which the ECHR does not contain, such as economic  and  social  rights,
    cultural rights and others belonging to the realms of the  environment,
    consumer protection and criminal justice.  The adoption of the  Charter
    is, by some measure, the most important  development  in  human  rights
    protection in Europe since the introduction of the ECHR over  60  years
    ago.

27. Article 24 of the Charter bears the title "The Rights  of  the  Child".
    Under this banner, it provides:

         "(1) Children shall have the right to such protection and  care  as
             is necessary for their  well-being.  They  may  express  their
             views freely.  Such views shall be taken into consideration on
             matters which concern them in accordance with  their  age  and
             maturity.


         (2)  In all actions relating to children, whether taken  by  public
             authorities  or  private  institutions,   the   child's   best
             interests must be a primary consideration.


         (3)  Every child shall have the right  to  maintain  on  a  regular
             basis a personal relationship and direct contact with both his
             or her  parents,  unless  this  is  contrary  to  his  or  her
             interests."

    I have highlighted paragraph (3), as this is the provision  of  Article
    24  which  the  Appellant  invokes.   Having  regard  to  the   gateway
    provisions of Article 51, it is clear that, by virtue  of  the  EU  law
    context, Article 24 applied to both  the  underlying  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State and that of the FtT on  appeal.   This  was  not  in
    dispute.  The parties were  also  agreed  that  Article  24(3)  extends
    beyond the narrow context of disputes relating to the residence of  and
    contact with children.

28. Article 24 has been considered by the  CJEU.   In  Deticek  v  Sgueglia
    [2009]  EUECJ  C-403/09   the   Court   gave   consideration   to   the
    interpretation of Council Regulation  (EC)  2201/2003.   This  concerns
    jurisdiction and  the  recognition  and  enforcement  of  judgments  in
    matrimonial matters and, specifically, the  question  of  whether  this
    permits a provisional child custody measure in  certain  circumstances.
    The Court, having noted that the Charter features in  the  preamble  to
    the Regulation, described the rights of the child contained in  Article
    24 as "fundamental", at [53], continuing:

         "[54]    One of those fundamental rights of the child is the right,
         set out in Article 24(3) of the Charter, to maintain on  a  regular
         basis a personal relationship and direct contact with both parents,
         respect for that right undeniably merging into the  best  interests
         of any child.


         [55] Article 20 of Regulation No 2201/2003 cannot be interpreted in
         such a way that it disregards that fundamental right.


         [56] In this respect, it is clear that the wrongful  removal  of  a
         child, following a  decision  taken  unilaterally  by  one  of  the
         parents, more often than not deprives the child of the  possibility
         of maintaining on a  regular  basis  a  personal  relationship  and
         direct contact with the other parent.


         [57] Article 20 of Regulation  No  2201/2003  cannot  therefore  be
         interpreted in such a way that it can be used by the parent who has
         wrongfully removed the child as an instrument  for  prolonging  the
         factual situation caused by his or  her  wrongful  conduct  or  for
         legitimating the consequences of that conduct.


         [58] It is true that,  under  Article  24(3)  of  the  Charter,  an
         exception may be made to the child's fundamental right to  maintain
         on a regular basis a personal relationship and direct contact  with
         both parents if that interest proves  to  be  contrary  to  another
         interest of the child."


         This analysis gave rise to the following conclusion:

         "[59]    It follows that a measure which prevents  the  maintenance
         on a regular basis of a personal relationship  and  direct  contact
         with both parents can be justified only by another interest of  the
         child of such importance that it takes priority over  the  interest
         underlying that fundamental right."

29. In a later decision, McB v El E [2010] EUECJ C-400/10, a case which had
    a Hague Convention context involving the disputed  return  of  a  child
    from the United Kingdom to the Republic of Ireland, the CJEU  said  the
    following, at [60]:

         "It must also be borne in mind  that  Article  7  of  the  Charter,
         mentioned by the referring court in its question, must be read in a
         way which respects the obligation to take  into  consideration  the
         child's  best  interests,  recognised  in  Article  24(2)  of  that
         Charter, and taking into account the fundamental right of  a  child
         to maintain on a regular basis personal  relationships  and  direct
         contact with both of his or her parents, stated  in  Article  24(3)
         (see, to that effect, Case C-540/03 Parliament v Council [2006] ECR
         I-5769, paragraph 58). Moreover, it is apparent from recital 33  in
         the preamble  to  Regulation  No 2201/2003  that  that  regulation
         recognises the fundamental rights and observes  the  principles  of
         the Charter, while, in particular, seeking to  ensure  respect  for
         the fundamental rights of the child as set out in Article 24 of the
         Charter. Accordingly, the provisions of that regulation  cannot  be
         interpreted in such a way  that  they  disregard  that  fundamental
         right of the child, the respect for which  undeniably  merges  into
         the best interests of the child  (see,  to  that  effect,  Case  C-
         403/09 PPU Deti?ek [2009] ECR I-0000, paragraphs 53 to 55)."

    There was some focus in the arguments of  counsel  on  the  "undeniably
    merges into" part of the above passage.  In my  judgment,  taking  into
    account its approach in Deticek, to which explicit reference  is  made,
    the Court was  not  suggesting  that  Article  24(3)  adds  nothing  of
    substance to Article 24(2).


30. I am of the opinion that Article 24(3) creates a free  standing  right.
    It may, of course, be viewed  as  the  unequivocal  articulation  of  a
    concrete  "best  interests"  right  and,  on  this   analysis,   is   a
    development, or elaboration, of Article 24(2).  Furthermore, given  the
    exception formulated in the final clause of Article  24(3),  the  nexus
    with Article 24(2) is unmistakable. However, I consider it  clear  that
    Article 24(3) was designed to create  a  discrete  right,  an  analysis
    which is harmonious with general principles of EU law.   These  include
    the well known principle that every part of a  measure  of  EU  law  is
    presumed to have a separate and individual effect and impact.   Article
    24(3) may also be viewed through the prism of the principle that  where
    one has an amalgam of  specific  and  general  provisions,  the  former
    should  normally  be  considered  in  advance  of  the  latter.    This
    construction is further fortified by the Commentary of the  Charter  of
    Fundamental Rights of the European Union (published by the  EU  Network
    of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights), at p207:


         ".....  Children are no longer considered  as  mere  recipients  of
         services or beneficiaries of  protective  measures  but  rather  as
         rights holders and participants in actions affecting them."

31. Notwithstanding that Article 24(3) of the Charter was canvassed in  the
    Appellant's written argument at first instance, the decision of the FtT
    is silent on this issue.  This failure is reflected in the  submissions
    of Mr Blundell which, reduced to their  essential  core,  advanced  the
    contention that no material error  of  law  had  been  committed.   The
    outworkings of this argument were that the FtT was clearly aware of the
    issue of separation of the Appellant from his children, something which
    is, in Mr Blundell's words, an "ever present" in cases of this kind.

32. The main flaw in this argument, in my view, is that  it  overlooks  the
    profound nature of the flaw in the decision of the FtT.  In short,  the
    Judge failed to acknowledge the existence of a right conferred on  both
    children by one of the constitutional measures of EU law.   Ipso facto,
    he also failed  to  appreciate  that  this  has  been  characterised  a
    "fundamental" right in the jurisprudence of the CJEU.   If  this  error
    had been avoided, it is as a minimum possible, as  Mr  Knafler  argued,
    that the Judge's analysis in the passages to quoted in [13] above would
    have been quite different. In particular, it seems to me  inconceivable
    that the vague  "a  relationship"  and  the  limp  "in  some  jeopardy"
    assessments would have featured.  I  conclude,  accordingly,  that  the
    FtT's error of law on this issue cannot be dismissed as immaterial.

Omnibus Conclusion

33. Having found that the decision of the FtT is infected by  two  material
    errors of law, I order that it be set aside.

34. The Upper Tribunal is fully equipped to re-make the  decision  and  the
    appeal is, therefore, retained in this forum for such purpose.

35. If  either  party  wishes  to  propose  any  specific  case  management
    directions, this must be effected in writing not later than 15  January
    2016.  Directions and/or a case management review may follow.
