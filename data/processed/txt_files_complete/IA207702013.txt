                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. By application dated 17 February 2013 the appellant, a Cuban, sought
       further leave to remain in the UK as a spouse.  To question  8.2  on
       the form,  "Are  you  a  national  of  a  majority  English-speaking
       country?" he  incorrectly  answered,  "Yes".   He  did  not  provide
       evidence that he met the English language requirement in the rules.


    2. By letter and notice dated 13 May 2013 the  respondent  refused  the
       application for failure  to  meet  that  requirement,  and  directed
       removal to Cuba.

    3. The appellant filed notice of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  on
       31 May 2013.  His grounds, prepared by legal representatives, assert
       that he did not know about the  English  language  test  certificate
       requirement, introduced after his first grant  of  leave;  that  the
       respondent should have given  him  the  chance  to  produce  further
       evidence; and that the decision would breach article 8 rights of the
       appellant, his wife, and family.

    4. On 20 August 2013 the First-tier Tribunal issued notice  of  hearing
       on 20 March 2014.  On that date,  the  appellant  attended  and  was
       granted an adjournment due to the absence of  his  wife,  who  would
       have been a witness but was in hospital, and to  withdrawal  of  his
       representatives.

    5. On 24 March 2014 the First-tier Tribunal issued by first class  post
       notice of hearing on 7 April 2014.  The case came before  First-tier
       Tribunal  Judge  Wallace  on  that  date.   In   her   determination
       promulgated on 17 April 2014 she explains at �13 that she  appellant
       did not appear and had provided no explanation, so she proceeded  in
       his absence.  She also records at �19 that she was  told  after  the
       hearing that the appellant had contacted the tribunal administration
       (presumably by telephone) to say that  he  received  the  notice  of
       hearing only on the morning of the hearing.  She went on to  dismiss
       the appeal.

    6. (The appellant lives in Fort  William,  too  far  from  the  hearing
       centre for him to attend on the same day as he received the  notice,
       even if his post arrived early.)

    7. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal are that the  First-tier
       Tribunal erred  by  failing  to  adjourn  the  hearing;  by  wrongly
       referring to "the entry clearance decision"; by failing to  exercise
       discretion over the language requirement; and by failing to consider
       whether the case might succeed outside the rules, under article 8.

    8. Having  heard  helpful  submissions  from  both  representatives,  I
       indicated that the appeal would be allowed.

    9. The appellant had advised Mr McGinley  that  he  works  as  a  night
       porter in a hotel.  He received the notice of hearing on return from
       work, and telephoned the tribunal right away.

   10. It is plain that the appellant had shown every sign of pursuing  his
       case, and although  the  postal  delay  is  surprisingly  long,  the
       explanation seems  more  likely  than  not.   There  may  have  been
       procedural unfairness.  However, I was persuaded that the appeal  to
       the First-tier Tribunal should have succeeded on other  grounds,  so
       the point is not crucial.

   11. The grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  were  poorly
       prepared, and not of as much help to the judge.

   12. The judge's reference to "the entry clearance decision" is careless.
        It might not on its own be significant, but it is the clue  to  why
       the judge went  wrong  about  the  admissibility  and  relevance  of
       evidence that  the  appellant  obtained  an  English  language  test
       certificate after the respondent made her decision, but prior to the
       hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

   13.  This  was  not  an  entry  clearance  case,  nor  one  governed  by
       restrictions on evidence under s.85A of the 2002 Act.  It fell under
       s. 85(4), which enables the tribunal to "... consider evidence about
       any matter  which  it  thinks  relevant  to  the  substance  of  the
       decision, including one which concerns a matter  arising  after  the
       date of  the  decision."   LS  (Post-decision  evidence,  Direction,
       Appealability) [2005] UKAIT 85 explained this at �9:


              ... s 85  draws  a  clear  line  between  refusals  of  entry
              clearance and certificate of entitlement and all other cases.
              Only in the former two types of case does the "clock stop" so
              that evidence of circumstances appertaining after the date of
              the decision cannot be taken into account. In all other cases
              the Adjudicator is under no such restriction, and it  follows
              that if an appellant claims that  the  decision  "is  not  in
              accordance with immigration rules", he is entitled to  adduce
              evidence as to the present position, even if it is clear (or,
              as in the present appeal, conceded) that the requirements  of
              the Immigration Rules  were  not  met  at  the  date  of  the
              decision itself.

   14. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  do  not  say  what  the
       source of the judge's "discretion" might be.  However, although  not
       specific on the point of admissibility and  relevance  of  evidence,
       they are sufficient to accommodate it.  Once the  correct  statutory
       provision is pointed out, the case is  simple.   The  appellant  put
       matters right by producing the certificate.


   15. There was never any viable case based on Article 8 ECHR outside  the
       Immigration Rules, but that is not a live issue.


   16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside  and  the
       appeal, as originally brought to the First-tier Tribunal, is allowed
       under the Immigration Rules.
