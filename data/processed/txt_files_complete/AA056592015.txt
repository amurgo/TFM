                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Sreeraman, Home Officer Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms C Querton of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent appealed, with permission, against the decision of Judge
    Eames promulgated on 10th  September  2015,  allowing  the  appellant's
    appeal against the respondent's decision  to  remove  her  to  Pakistan
    following a decision to refuse to  grant  her  leave  to  remain  as  a
    refugee,  humanitarian  protection  or  protection  of   the   European
    Convention.  The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 5th August
    1991.

 2. The background to the appeal is that the appellant lived in Nigeria  on
    a residency visa which was renewed every few  years  and  she  had  not
    lived in Pakistan.  She was issued with a  visit  visa  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2001, 2004 and 2007 and a further visa of a type unknown  in
    2012.  She entered the UK on 17th July 2012 leaving Nigeria  using  her
    own passport and on 18th October 2012 she was issued  with  an  IS151A,
    IS75 and IS76 on grounds of verbal deception seeking leave to remain in
    the UK and she claimed asylum on 18th October 2012.

 3. The appellant claims that she had converted  to  Christianity  and  she
    would be afraid to go to Pakistan not least because of  her  membership
    of a particular social group, and that being she was a single woman she
    may be ill-treated.

 4. The respondent accepted that she had never lived in  Pakistan  but  her
    conversion to Christianity and the claimed relationship with her father
    was  not  accepted.   Overall  her  credibility  was  not  accepted  in
    particular that she was a genuine refugee and in need of  international
    protection.  Her case was also considered under  paragraph  276ADE  and
    Appendix FM and outside the Rules on human rights grounds.  Suffice  it
    to say that the reasons for refusal letter ran to 23 pages.

 5. When the hearing came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Eames at Newport
    on 20th August 2015 the Home Office Presenting Officer Ms Davies sought
    an adjournment at the start of the hearing on the grounds that the case
    had been a float (i.e. not listed to any  particular  Tribunal  Judge's
    list and taken on only when a Judge had space  on  their  list).   This
    meant that the Home Office Presenting Officer maintained that  she  had
    not  had  time  to  prepare  the  case  and  there  was  a  substantial
    appellant's bundle.  It involved two potential countries of return  and
    Ms Davies stated that she only had the lunch break to prepare  most  of
    which had been spent consulting with her manager about how to  proceed.



 6. The Judge recorded at paragraph 8 that the  hearing  was  beginning  at
    1330 and she argued that picking up the float case that late in the day
    without  having  seen  it  prejudiced  the  respondent   and   it   was
    inappropriate to list an asylum case such as this as a float.

 7. At the hearing before me  Mrs  Sreeraman  noted  the  case  of  Nwaigwe
    (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC)  which  made  it  clear
    that the  principle  in  issue  was  fairness  and  in  this  case  the
    respondent had been deprived of the opportunity to prepare the case and
    thus participate.  A previous judge had clearly deemed it as unsuitable
    and this was recorded at paragraph 10.  She referred to Rule 2  of  The
    Tribunal Procedure Rules (First-tier Tribunal) (IAC) 2014  and  averred
    that proper consideration had not been given to the case.   The  asylum
    claim was a complex matter involving issues  relating  to  credibility,
    religion and social grouping.

 8. Ms Querton, in a valiant attempt, asserted that there was no  error  of
    law and noted that the Judge  had  balanced  the  competing  interests,
    noted that the Home Office Presenting  Officer  had  not  had  time  to
    prepare, that a  previous  Judge  had  identified  this  case  was  not
    suitable for a  float  but  asked  himself  the  correct  questions  in
    relation to the overriding objective in the interests of  justice.   Of
    particular importance was the issue of delay the appellant had  claimed
    asylum in 2012 and the decision had been given in 2015.

 9. Fairness required that the matter regarding delay was considered.   The
    basis of the claim had not changed and there were no new issues  to  be
    considered.  Even if there was an indication that there  was  an  error
    that it was not material because the determination was well drafted and
    clear the Judge directed himself to the relevant  country  guidance  in
    the treatment of women.  The Secretary of State did take  part  in  the
    case and there was cross-examination.  There was no specific  prejudice
    although she conceded that the central issue worked in relation to  the
    appellant's Christianity.

Conclusions

10. I set out the overriding objective Rule 2  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure
    Rules (First-tier Tribunal) (IAC) 2014:

         2.-  (1) The overriding objective of these Rules is to  enable  the
                Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly.

           (2)    Dealing with a case fairly and justly includes -

                (a)    dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate
                    to the importance of the case,  the  complexity  of  the
                    issues, the anticipated costs and the resources  of  the
                    parties and of the Tribunal;

                (b)      avoidance   unnecessary   formality   and   seeking
                    flexibility in the proceedings;

                (c)    ensuring, so far as practicable, that the parties are
                    able to participate fully in the proceedings;

                (d)     using  any  special  expertise   of   the   Tribunal
                    effectively; and

                (e)    avoiding delay , so far  as  compatible  with  proper
                    consideration of the issues.

           (3)    The Tribunal must seek to give effect to  the  overriding
                objective when it -

                (a)    exercises any power under these Rules; or

                (b)    interprets any rule or practice direction.

           (4)    Parties must -

                (a)     help  the  Tribunal  to   further   the   overriding
                    objective; and

                (b)    co-operate with the Tribunal generally.

11. Not only is the question of delay pertinent but  dealing  with  a  case
    fairly and justly included dealing with the  case  in  ways  which  are
    proportionate to the importance of the case and the complexity  of  the
    issues.  This is an asylum case with a wealth of evidence and which had
    already been marked as unsuitable for a float case and it would  appear
    from the commencement of the timing that it was started  at  half  past
    one in the middle of the lunchtime.  Of particular importance  is  Rule
    2(2)(c) which identifies that it is necessary  to  ensure,  so  far  as
    practicable, that the parties are able  to  participate  fully  in  the
    proceedings.  The avoidance of delay is qualified by the provision that
    this should be so far as compatible with proper  consideration  of  the
    issues.  There is no doubt that this was a very complex case not  least
    involving credibility and whether  or  not  the  appellant  had  indeed
    converted to Christianity.

12. I note particularly that the Judge  recorded  the  evidence  which  was
    submitted prior to the reasons for refusal letter  but  it  is  evident
    that witness statements of the appellant and her fiancï¿½ together with a
    detailed response to the reasons for refusal letter were  submitted  on
    5th August 2015, at a time which  postdates  the  reasons  for  refusal
    letter and there is evidence that would need to have been considered by
    the respondent.

13. Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014]  UKUT  00418  (IAC)  decides  as
    follows

         "If a Tribunal refuses to accede to an  adjournment  request,  such
         decision could, in  principle,  be  erroneous  in  law  in  several
         respects: these include a failure to take into account all material
         considerations; permitting immaterial  considerations  to  intrude;
         denying the party concerned a fair hearing; failing  to  apply  the
         correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most  cases
         the question will be whether  the  refusal  deprived  the  affected
         party of his right to a fair hearing.  Where an adjournment refusal
         is challenged on fairness grounds, it  is  important  to  recognise
         that the question for the Upper Tribunal is  not  whether  the  FtT
         acted reasonably.  Rather, the  test  to  be  applied  is  that  of
         fairness:  was there any deprivation of the affected party's  right
         to a fair hearing? See SH (Afghanistan) v Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 1284".

14. This underlines that it is not whether the  First-tier  Tribunal  acted
    reasonably rather that the test to be applied is that of  fairness.   I
    fail to see how the Home Office Presenting Officer at such short notice
    and with the extent of material to cover could participate fully in the
    proceedings.  The Judge did note that the case was listed as unsuitable
    for floating "like all asylum appeals" [10] and there is no  indication
    that evidence was submitted that the respondent had agreed at a  higher
    level to the case being a  float.   Unfortunately  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had waited long enough was of  limited  application  in  this
    instance particularly bearing in mind the matter now will  have  to  be
    reheard.

15. I  bear  in  mind  the  submission  that  the  Judge  made  a  detailed
    determination applying the relevant case law but regrettably it is  the
    fact-finding which is also crucial in a case of this nature and as such
    I find that the error in procedure undermines  that  process  and  thus
    there is a material error of law through the failure to allow the  Home
    Office to participate fully.

16. I therefore allow the application for permission to appeal on the basis
    that there is an error of law which may be material.

17. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
