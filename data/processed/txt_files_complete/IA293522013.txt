                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Secretary of State in relation to a Decision and Reasons of the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge O Del Fabbro) promulgated on 5th November 2014  by
    which he allowed the Appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds.

 2. For the sake of clarity and continuity I will  continue  to  refer,  in
    this determination,  to  Mr  Medvedev  as  the  Appellant  and  to  the
    Secretary of State as the Respondent.

 3. The Appellant is a national of Russia born on 21st  December  1983.  He
    first entered the United Kingdom in February 2009 as a student and  was
    then granted further leave to remain as the civil partner of a  British
    National until 17th May 2012. He then made  a  further  application  to
    remain which was initially refused in January 2013 because he  had  not
    passed an English language test. That refusal was reissued in June 2013
    because the Appellant had returned to  Russia  for  family  reasons  in
    2013.  The Appellant appealed against the refusal on the  grounds  that
    he remained in a civil partnership and the refusal breached  his  human
    rights.

 4. The appeal came first before the First-tier Tribunal in  January  2014.
    On that occasion Judge Miller heard that the  Appellant's  relationship
    with his partner had irretrievably broken down, in part because of  the
    partner having mental health  issues  and  he  was  now  in  a  settled
    relationship with Marcus Cashman,  a  British  national.  Judge  Miller
    dismissed the appeal.

 5. That decision was set aside by the Upper Tribunal for having  contained
    a material error of law and the case was  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. It was the remittal which came before  Judge  Del  Fabbro  on
    26th August 2014.

 6. The nature of the relationship between the Appellant and Mr Cashman,  a
    British national, is not in issue. Judge Del Fabbro accepted  that  the
    Appellant and Mr Cashman commenced their relationship in  May  or  June
    2013 and that the relationship is genuine and subsisting. Mr Cashman is
    employed by stockbrokers earning in excess of ï¿½34,000 per annum and the
    Appellant is also in  employment.  The  Appellant  has  had  difficulty
    making contact with his former partner and so has been unable to  bring
    the civil partnership to an end.

 7. The Appellant's mother in Russia does not know of his sexuality and  he
    is concerned that he would not be able to live openly with his  partner
    in Russia.  His  partner  does  not  speak  Russian  and  the  language
    difficulty  would  prevent  him  working  and  living  in  Russia.  The
    Appellant says that his life is in the UK. He works and pays taxes  and
    has many friends here.

 8. Judge Del Fabbro  found  that  the  Appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of Appendix FM. He does not meet the definition of partner
    under the Rules and neither does he meet the requirements of  paragraph
    276ADE of the Rules; the provision of  the  Immigration  Rules  dealing
    with private life. The Judge then went on to consider whether he should
    consider Article 8 under the ECHR and outside the Rules. He found there
    were arguable grounds for a consideration of Article 8 under the  ECHR.
    That was a matter he was entitled to find.

 9. The Judge then at paragraph 14 took into  account  that  the  Appellant
    would be unable to qualify under the Rules in an  application  to  join
    his partner in the UK and so the only alternative was for the couple to
    both go to Russia, which he found  to  be  unreasonable.  In  attaching
    weight to the possible outcome of any future application  to  an  Entry
    Clearance Officer,  the  Judge  erred.  Doing  so  is  speculative  and
    irrelevant (SB (Bangladesh) [2007] EWCA Civ 28).

10. The Judge then went  on  at  paragraph  16  to  refer  himself  to  the
    provisions of section 117B the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002 as inserted by section 19 of the Immigration Act  2014.  He  noted
    the various positive factors weighing in favour of  the  Appellant.  He
    then found that the Appellant's status in the UK could not be  said  to
    be precarious at the time of the  application  because  he  had  extant
    leave. That was also an error. It has now been made clear by AM (S117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT  0260  (IAC)  that  Parliament  has  drawn  a  sharp
    distinction between any period of time during which a person  has  been
    in the UK "unlawfully"  and  any  period  of  time  during  which  that
    person's immigration status in the UK is merely "precarious." Those who
    at any given day held a precarious immigration status must have held at
    that date an otherwise lawful grant of leave  to  enter  or  remain.  A
    person's immigration status is "precarious" if their continued presence
    in the United Kingdom will be dependent on their  obtaining  a  further
    grant of leave. That is the situation of this  Appellant.   It  applied
    when he commenced his relationship with Mr Cashman and when he made his
    application. In finding his status was  not  precarious  therefore  the
    Judge erred.

11. Both of those findings were determinative of the  Judge's  decision  to
    allow the appeal and thus the errors were material and I set aside  the
    Judge's decision.

12. This appeal has already been before the Upper Tribunal and remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal. I therefore decided to redecide the appeal  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

13. The  Appellant  confirmed  that  save  for  the  passage  of  time  his
    circumstances remain as they were before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Mr
    Melvin did not challenge the genuineness of his  relationship  and  the
    Appellant relied on the same evidence that he had relied on before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

14. I see no reason to differ from the First-tier Tribunal judge's decision
    that the circumstances of this particular case merit  consideration  of
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules. It is quite  clear  that  this
    case is about proportionality. Article 8 is clearly engaged with regard
    to the  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  his  partner.   The
    Secretary of State's decision to remove him is clearly a lawful one and
    in accordance with the Immigration Rules.

15. In considering proportionality I am required by  section  117A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to take into  account  the
    factors contained in section 117B.

16. Section 117B provides:-


    117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases


    (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
interest.


    (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
the economic well-being
    of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the
United Kingdom
    are able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
         (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b) are better able to integrate into society.


    (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
the economic well-being
    of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the
United Kingdom
    are financially independent, because such persons-
         (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b) are better able to integrate into society.


    (4) Little weight should be given to-
         (a) a private life, or
         (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.


    (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
    person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.


    (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
public interest does not
    require the person's removal where-
         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
    with a qualifying
         child, and


         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
    United Kingdom.



17.  In this case the Appellant speaks  English  and  as  both  he  and  his
    partner are in employment he is financially independent.

18.  The Appellant has not formed a relationship or  built  up  his  private
    life whilst in the UK unlawfully.

19.  However, as indicated  above  in  my  decision  as  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's  error  of  law,  the  Appellant's  immigration  status  was
    precarious at the time that  he  commenced  his  relationship  with  Mr
    Cashman. That relationship undoubtedly constitutes private life. It  is
    less clear whether it constitutes family life. In terms of  whether  it
    can constitute family life one would need to consider the definition of
    "partner". A "partner" is not defined in  the  2002  Act.  There  is  a
    definition for a "qualifying partner" as  being  a  partner  who  is  a
    British citizen  or  settled  in  the  UK.  However  in  terms  of  the
    definition of partner the statute is silent. To inform  the  definition
    of "partner" therefore I look to the Immigration Rules. They do not  of
    course  have  the  force  of  statute  but  nevertheless  are  a  clear
    indication of Parliament's view which of course is  also  reflected  by
    Statute. The Immigration Rules define a "partner" as a spouse, a  civil
    partner or a person with whom a person has been living for  two  years.
    As the Appellant and Mr Cashman only  met  in  May  or  June  of  2013,
    notwithstanding that their relationship progressed rapidly, I find they
    would not qualify as "partners" under the Rules.   The  fact  that  the
    Civil Partnership with his former partner still exists  does  not  have
    any effect. If they  are  not  "partners"  then  it  seems  that  their
    relationship cannot be "family Life".  However,  that  is  rather  more
    form than substance as it clearly represents a  significant  aspect  of
    the Appellant's private life.

20.  The private life that the Appellant has acquired in the United  Kingdom
    with his partner was at a time when his status was precarious and  thus
    little weight can be attached to it.  The same would  apply  to  family
    life in any event.  ECHR jurisprudence is  clear  that  a  relationship
    commenced at a time when an Appellant cannot have  any  expectation  of
    being allowed to remain carries little weight.  The Appellant could not
    have had an expectation that he would be permitted to continue to enjoy
    his relationship in the UK unless he could meet the Immigration Rules.

21.  I am prepared to accept that it would not be reasonable to  suggest  Mr
    Cashman should leave the United Kingdom and reside in Russia.  However,
    that is a matter of choice for him.  There  is  of  course  nothing  to
    prevent  the  Appellant  from  returning  to  Russia  and   making   an
    application to join Mr Cashman in the UK. The Immigration Rules contain
    the conditions to be met by persons wishing to come to the UK either on
    a temporary or permanent basis. If a person can meet  those  conditions
    they can enter or remain and if not they cannot.

22.  When I asked the Appellant why he could not return to  Russia  to  make
    an application to enter the United Kingdom, he said that  he  would  be
    sad to be separated from Mr Cashman and that he knows applications take
    a while. He said that it would be easier to stay in the UK and sort out
    his status rather than go back to Russia. While that may well  be  true
    it is an inconvenience rather than an insurmountable obstacle and  does
    not render his removal disproportionate.

23.  Quite simply, the Appellant in this case  does  not  meet  any  of  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain and there  is
    nothing about his situation which is unusual/compelling/exceptional  to
    permit his remaining under Article 8 of the ECHR.

24.  Having decided that the First-tier Tribunal made an  error  of  law  in
    its decision  and  having  set  that  decision   aside,  I  remake  the
    decision and allow the Secretary of State's appeal with the result that
    the Appellant's  original  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision is dismissed.


No anonymity direction is made.
