Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr S Subbarayan
For the Respondent: Miss A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellants and Proceedings

    1. The first  appellant  was  born  on  27th  March  1945;  the  second
       appellant is his wife, born  on  14th  March  1952.  They  are  both
       nationals of Albania.  They  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       against the decision of the respondent made on  6th  March  2013  to
       refuse their application for a family visit to the United Kingdom.


    2. In a determination promulgated  on  26th  November  2013  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge T R P Hollingworth (the Judge) dismissed  the  appeal
       under paragraph 41(i) and (ii) of the Immigration  Rules.  After  an
       initial refusal of permission to appeal the appellants were  granted
       permission in the Upper Tribunal to appeal against the  decision  of
       the Judge to the Upper Tribunal by Upper Tribunal Judge  Taylor  for
       the following reasons:


         It is arguable that the judge, having found that the refusal  under
         paragraph 320 (7B) was not sustainable,  did  not  give  clear  and
         adequate reasons for dismissing the appeal under paragraph 41.   He
         seems to have based his decision on a lack of information about the
         appellants' pensions but it is said in the grounds that all of  the
         relevant information was in the appellants' bundle.   I  also  note
         that he did not  make  any  findings  on  the  credibility  of  the
         sponsor's evidence.


    3. The matter accordingly came before me  for  an  initial  hearing  to
       determine whether the making  of  the  decision  in  the  First-tier
       Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law.


    Consideration of Issues and Submissions


    4. The entry clearance officer (ECO) applied paragraph 320(7B)  to  the
       application having  found  that  deception  had  been  used  by  the
       appellants by concealing the presence of  a  family  member  in  the
       United Kingdom and by failing to  disclose  a  previous  refusal  of
       entry clearance.  He  went  on  to  consider  paragraph  41  of  the
       Immigration Rules and because of the  adverse  credibility  findings
       under paragraph  320(7B)  doubted  the  genuine  intentions  of  the
       appellants and further   refused  the  application  under  paragraph
       41(i), (ii), (vi) and (vii) of the Rules; he was not satisfied  that
       the visit was genuine or for  the  period  and  purpose  stated;  he
       doubted that  the appellants intended to leave the united Kingdom at
       the end of the proposed visit.


    5. The ECO noted that  the  appellants  had  a  pension  but  found  it
       insufficient to outweigh concerns about the application overall.  He
       found a lack of evidence of their accommodation and where they live;
       he found no evidence of assets, land, property, family or other ties
       of the appellants in Albania. The ECO was unclear  about  who  would
       fund the trip and found insufficient  evidence  of  the  appellants'
       full economic circumstances; he found the sponsor's  bank  statement
       showing an account in credit by  ï¿½698.47  to  disclose  insufficient
       funds to cover fares and maintenance for the visit. He dismissed the
       application for lack of evidence of maintenance and the  failure  to
       show that the cost of the onward journey could be met. The  decision
       was maintained by an entry clearance  manager  (ECM)  on  14th  June
       2013.


    6. The Judge found that paragraph 320(7B) of the  Rules  had  not  been
       properly applied and did not uphold that  aspect  of  the  decision.
       That  aspect  of  the  decision  has  not  been  challenged  by  the
       respondent and accordingly stands. The Judge heard evidence from the
       sponsor, the  appellants'  son,  and  accepted  that  he  was  in  a
       satisfactory position to pay for his parents' flights and incidental
       expenses for the duration of the visit.


    7. The aspect of the decision challenged before  me  is  therefore  the
       dismissal under  paragraphs  41(i)  and  (ii),  namely  the  Judge's
       finding that the visit was not for the period and purpose stated and
       that the appellants failed to show that they intended to  leave  the
       United Kingdom at the end of the  proposed  visit.  He  reached  his
       conclusions notwithstanding his acceptance in paragraph  23  of  his
       determination that they had demonstrated  in  2008  that  they  were
       visitors who would return.


    8. His reasoning was that there was: "frankly,  not  a  great  deal  of
       evidence in the  Appellants'  bundle".  He  found  no  documents  to
       clarify the appellants' pensions or to address  the  ECO's  concerns
       about their accommodation and living expenses. The Judge found  "not
       a great deal of evidence", if any, of the existence  in  Albania  of
       another son of the appellants, or whether he  contributes  to  their
       finances.


    9. Having heard submissions from Mr Subbarayan for the appellants  Miss
       Everett adopted, as always, a very  realistic  stance  and  conceded
       that the decision is difficult to defend in the light of the Judge's
       apparent failure to  consider  the  evidence  before  him  from  the
       appellants, some of which was contained in the respondent's  bundle.
       Miss Everett did not address me further other than to agree that the
       Judge's considerations had been brief before I announced my  finding
       that the Judge had materially erred in law in dismissing the  appeal
       under paragraph 41 so that the decision should be set aside in  that
       respect and remade.


   10. I find that the Judge erred in law by failing to take account of the
       evidence before him from the appellants, including evidence  of  the
       existence of their pension which was not in itself challenged by the
       ECO.  The Judge apparently overlooked or failed to take  account  of
       documentary  evidence  before  him,  at  pages  27  -  34   of   the
       respondent's bundle, showing details of the  appellants'  length  of
       residence and ownership of accommodation in Albania.


   11. At pages 1 - 6 of the appellants' bundle there are  statements  from
       them and the sponsor  asserting  the  presence  of  another  son  in
       Albania; at page 6 of the respondent's bundle there  is  a  copy  of
       this son's passport showing the endorsement  of  a  previous  family
       visit to the United Kingdom. I find that the Judge further erred  in
       law by concluding, without giving sufficient reasons, that the visit
       was not genuine and that the appellants did not intend to leave  the
       United Kingdom; the basis of this conclusion is  not  clear  in  the
       light of the Judge's explicit acceptance  that  the  appellants  had
       previously visited the United Kingdom and returned to Albania.


   12. In remaking the decision I take account of  all  the  documents  and
       statements contained in bundles from the respondent and  appellants,
       including those specifically referred to above.  I take  account  of
       the final submissions to me from the representatives and brief  oral
       evidence I heard from the sponsor, Mr Ardjan Kardhashi.  I  find  no
       reason to reach adverse credibility about the appellants or sponsor;
       they give consistent information  in  support  the  application  and
       appeal  which  is  appropriately  supported  with  documents.    The
       sponsor's evidence was  tested  under  cross-examination  and  I  am
       satisfied that it is reliable to the necessary standard.


   13. I accept the submission on behalf of the respondent  that  there  is
       more evidence before me that there was before the ECO on the date of
       decision.  I am, however, satisfied that the  evidence  pertains  to
       the circumstances at that date and I am satisfied  on  its  totality
       that the requirements of paragraph 41 of the Immigration  Rules  are
       met.


Summary of Decisions


   14. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  stands  in  relation  to
       paragraph 320(7B) of the Immigration Rules.


   15. The making of the First-tier Tribunal decision involved  the  making
       of an error on a point of law in relation  to  paragraph  41(i)  and
       (ii) of the Immigration Rules.


   16. The decision in relation to paragraph 41(i) and (ii)  is  set  aside
       and is remade as follows.


   17. The appeal is allowed paragraph 41(i) and (ii)  of  the  Immigration
       Rules.


   18. The appellants' appeal to the Upper Tribunal succeeds.

Anonymity


    I find no reason to change the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  not
    make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Fee Award

In the light of the appeal now being allowed I make a partial fee  award  of
ï¿½140, that being half the total amount paid by the appellants, in the  light
of the greater amount of evidence which has been made  available  since  the
date of the respondent's decision.
