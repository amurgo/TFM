Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order
The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  Court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  his  wife  or  children,
whether directly or indirectly. This order applies to, amongst  others,  all
parties. Any failure to comply with this order could give rise  to  contempt
of court proceedings.

Decision and reasons

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal to deport him to his country of origin and  to  refuse  him
   refugee protection, humanitarian protection, or leave to  remain  in  the
   United Kingdom on human rights grounds.  The appellant is  a  citizen  of
   Jamaica.

2. The appellant is a foreign  criminal  subject  to  automatic  deportation
   pursuant to section 32 of the UK Borders Act  2007.   He  challenges  the
   deportation order on human rights grounds.

Background

3. The appellant has a poor immigration  history.   He  entered  the  United
   Kingdom as a visitor on 8 November 2000, when he was 39 years old.   When
   his visit visa expired, he overstayed, making no attempt to  resolve  his
   immigration situation for about 2 years.  The appellant is 56  years  old
   now.

4. On 20 April 2002, the appellant married his wife, who had a daughter  and
   a son from a previous relationship.   On 31 January 2003,  the  appellant
   was granted discretionary  leave  until  18  March  2007,  based  on  his
   marriage. The appellant and his wife have two daughters together, born in
   2003 and 2005. The appellant also claims to have  family  life  with  his
   stepson born in 1997.

5. On 16 March 2007, the appellant  applied  for  further  leave  to  remain
   which was refused, as his marriage was not considered to  be  subsisting:
   he successfully challenged  that  decision  on  appeal  and  was  granted
   further discretionary leave expiring on 14 January 2011.

6. On 7 November 2007, the  appellant  was  convicted  at  Camberwell  Green
   Magistrates Court on charges of  driving  a  motor  vehicle  with  excess
   alcohol, using a vehicle whilst uninsured and driving otherwise  than  in
   accordance with a licence, for which he received a community sentence.

7. On 12 June 2012, the appellant was  convicted  at  the  Central  Criminal
   Court of raping his step-daughter in 2002, when she  was  just  11  years
   old, before his marriage to her mother.  The child's  evidence  was  that
   the rape was not an isolated incident: the sentencing remarks noted  that
   'there were ...further instances of sexual  misbehaviour  on  your  part,
   albeit nothing that justified any ... charge'.  He  was  sentenced  to  9
   years' imprisonment and to being placed on the Sex Offenders Register for
   an indefinite period.

8. His former partner and all three children are British citizens and  there
   is still an  injunction  preventing  him  from  living  with  them.   The
   children live with  their  mother.   The  appellant's  step-daughter  and
   stepson are both adults now.

9. On 19 May 2016, the respondent made a deportation order with  a  one-stop
   notice.  Following the deportation order, the appellant alleged  for  the
   first time that he was at risk in Jamaica on return because he  had  been
   involved in a financial arrangement for a Jamaican  person  then  in  the
   United Kingdom, in which he was supposed to transfer ï¿½20,000 in cash  via
   Western Union from the United Kingdom to  Jamaica.   When  challenged  by
   Western Union and told that such a large sum  could  not  be  transferred
   without a money laundering  investigation,  the  appellant  informed  his
   client (who was  now  in  Jamaica)  that  he  could  not  carry  out  the
   instructions and would dispose of the money.  He says he shredded it  and
   that if returned to Jamaica, he would be at risk of serious harm from the
   client.

10. The appellant claimed that he could not  be  deported  on  human  rights
   grounds and was entitled to the benefit of Exception 1 in  section  33(2)
   of the 2007 Act.

11. On 25 January  2017,  the  respondent  rejected  the  appellant's  human
   rights claim.  He accepted that it would be unduly harsh  to  expect  the
   children to live in Jamaica, but not that it was unduly harsh for them to
   remain in the United Kingdom without the appellant.  The  respondent  did
   not accept that it was in the children's best interest for the  appellant
   to remain in the United Kingdom: they were  safely  cared  for  by  their
   mother.  The appellant's outstanding application for indefinite leave  to
   remain as the spouse of a settled person was also refused.

First-tier Tribunal decision

12. The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard evidence from the appellant and  his
   estranged wife, whose accounts were not consistent.  She did not  believe
   the money laundering account, considering  it  to  be  a  fabrication  to
   enable the appellant to remain in the United Kingdom. In the alternative,
   she considered that there was a sufficiency of protection in Jamaica.

13. The Judge  did  believe  the  wife's  account  of  having  forgiven  the
   appellant for his treatment of her daughter  but  not  that  he  had  any
   relationship with his two daughters, whom he had not seen  for  over  six
   years:

         "39. I accept also that the appellant has a genuine and  subsisting
         relationship with his wife, albeit they are unable to live together
         because of the appellant's circumstances and will be unlikely to be
         able to do so in the foreseeable future.   I  cannot  be  satisfied
         that he has such a relationship with his children.  It is  apparent
         form the evidence that I heard that for  some  time  prior  to  his
         incarceration, the appellant was only permitted to see the children
         under supervision of social services. I am  satisfied  that  it  is
         likely that this will be the case in the future.   In this  regard,
         I have seen what is in the parole board report.  Further, I have to
         take account of the fact that the appellant has enjoyed  no  direct
         contact with the children for a period of over six years.  Indirect
         contact of the type  the  appellant  has  enjoyed  up  to  now  can
         continue if the appellant is deported to Jamaica.

         40.  In evidence  the  appellant's  wife  indicated  she  would  be
         prepared to go to Jamaica, once the children were old  enough.   In
         the meantime, she may continue to be in contact with the  appellant
         by way of telephone calls, Skype etc.  It may well also be that she
         can visit the appellant in Jamaica. "

14. The Judge applied sections 117A, 117B and 117C, before  concluding  that
   the appellant had not shown very compelling circumstances preventing  his
   deportation, having regard to his offending,  the  public  interest,  the
   lack of ability to have a family life of any great substance on  release,
   his immigration history in the  United  Kingdom,  and  his  prospects  of
   reintegration in Jamaica on return.

15. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

16. Permission to appeal was granted on the question whether the  First-tier
   Tribunal  Judge  had  considered  properly  the  best  interests  of  the
   appellant's children, although the Judge  who  granted  permission  noted
   that section 55 was not relied upon in the appellant's skeleton  argument
   before the First-tier Tribunal.

17. Permission was not granted in relation to the Judge's  consideration  of
   the section 72 certificate.

Rule 24 Reply

18. There was no Rule 24 Reply.

19. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

20. For the respondent, Mr Tufan accepted that  the  children  were  in  the
   United Kingdom.  He pointed out that the children were  British  citizens
   and could remain in the United Kingdom with  their  mother.   The  second
   decision from the respondent dated 20  November  2017  dealt  with  their
   circumstances.

21. In order to succeed, paragraph 398 of the Rules required  the  appellant
   to demonstrate very compelling circumstances over and above the existence
   of a genuine and subsisting relationship, as it had not been  established
   that it would be unduly harsh for the children to remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom without the appellant.   The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had  not
   been satisfied that there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
   between the appellant and his children.  Paragraph 399(a)  of  the  Rules
   fell at the first hurdle.  The appellant could not now be  heard  to  say
   that it was not in the children's  section  55  best  interests  for  the
   appellant to be deported, having made no oral or written  submissions  to
   that effect before the First-tier Tribunal.

22. For the appellant, Mr Pipi relied on the First-tier Judge's  failure  to
   mention section 55 and the  wife's  witness  statement,  which  reflected
   difficulties at school  and  letters  written  by  the  children  to  the
   appellant in custody, saying how much they missed him.  There had been no
   application under the Family Court Protocol to admit  evidence  from  the
   family court proceedings, but  Mr  Pipi  confirmed  that  the  injunction
   remained in place and that before his incarceration,  the  appellant  was
   permitted only supervised contact.

23. A  report  had  been  requested,  but  not  obtained,  from  the  school
   psychologist involved with the children.  Mr Pipi submitted that  it  was
   not inevitable that another Judge would reach the same conclusion on  the
   best interests of the children as the First-tier Tribunal Judge had done.

24. Mr Pipi accepted that he had made  no  section  55  submissions  to  the
   First-tier Tribunal, either in his skeleton argument or orally.   Section
   55 was also not dealt with in the refusal letter,  as  the  Secretary  of
   State did not accept that the children were in the United  Kingdom.   The
   Judge had found that they were.  Mr Pipi said that the children  had  not
   visited their father in prison, with contact being limited  to  telephone
   calls and so on.

Discussion

25. I remind myself that it is only the question  of  the  section  55  best
   interests of the children for which permission  to  appeal  was  granted.
   The appellant did not argue that question, either in writing  or  orally,
   at the First-tier Tribunal hearing. Nor has the appellant  disclosed  why
   the  Family  Court  maintains  the  injunction,  six  years   after   his
   conviction.

26. The First-tier Tribunal made  a  finding  of  fact,  having  heard  oral
   evidence  and  submissions,  that  the  appellant  has  no  genuine   and
   subsisting relationship with his children.  I am not satisfied  that  the
   First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law in the brief but cogent  reasoning
   in paragraphs 39-40 of the decision, nor  in  reaching  that  finding  of
   fact.

27.  The  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  on  this   issue   is   proper,
   intelligible, and adequate.  There is no material error  of  law  in  her
   conclusion and I uphold her decision.

DECISION

28. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

   The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error on  a
   point of law
   I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
