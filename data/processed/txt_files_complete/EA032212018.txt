Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal, instructed by Rainbow Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 10 April  1982  (also
       given as 10 June 1982 in his appeal forms). He arrived in the UK on 5
       October 2010 with leave to enter as a Tier 4  student  migrant  valid
       until 22 February 2012. He was granted further leave to remain  until
       10 April 2015 on the same basis,  but  that  leave  was  subsequently
       curtailed to expire on 27 September 2014. The appellant met  his  EEA
       sponsor, [GV], a Hungarian national, in February 2013 and  they  were
       married on 21 February 2014. On 11 April 2014 the  appellant  applied
       for an EEA residence card as the family member  (spouse)  of  an  EEA
       national. His application was refused on 18 July 2014  on  the  basis
       that he was not the family member of an EEA  national  since  he  had
       entered into a marriage of convenience. That decision was based  upon
       the  outcome  of  a  visit  to  the  appellant's  given  address   by
       immigration officers which concluded that neither the  appellant  nor
       his spouse had ever resided there.

    2. The appellant appealed against that decision. His appeal was heard on
       11 February 2015 before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  O'Garro.  Neither
       the appellant nor his spouse attended to give oral evidence but  they
       provided written statements, in which the appellant claimed  to  have
       moved to another address with his spouse  shortly  after  making  his
       application, in June 2014, and had forgotten to inform the respondent
       of his change of address. The judge accepted that the  appellant  and
       his spouse had been living together at the former address in February
       and March 2014 and at the new address since at least 4 July 2014. The
       judge concluded on the basis of that evidence  that  the  appellant's
       marriage was genuine and she allowed the appeal, The respondent  then
       issued the appellant with a residence card on 5 March 2015, valid for
       five years until 5 March  2020,  as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
       national.

    3. Following an immigration enforcement visit made  to  the  appellant's
       home on 17 August 2017, the visiting immigration officers  considered
       there to be no satisfactory evidence of a subsisting relationship and
       they  arrested  the  appellant  and  took  him  into  detention.  The
       appellant was served with  a  removal  decision  in  accordance  with
       section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum 1999  Act  and  pursuant  to
       regulations 26(6)(a) and 32(2)  of  the  EEA  Regulations,  dated  17
       August 2017.

    4. Subsequent to that decision, which had the effect of  curtailing  the
       appellant's  right  of  residence  under  the  EEA  Regulations,  the
       appellant made a further application for a residence card  under  the
       EEA Regulations  on  the  basis  of  the  same  relationship,  on  11
       September 2017, by which time he had been released on bail.  In  that
       application he stated that he was separated from his sponsor and that
       divorce proceedings were being pursued. He produced  a  petition  for
       divorce dated 4 September 2017. The application  was  refused  on  11
       December 2017, on the basis that he had failed to provide a valid  ID
       card or passport for his sponsor and that his application  could  not
       be considered as one for a retained right of residence as  there  was
       no decree absolute. The decision was not an appealable one.

    5. The appellant then made an application  on  23  January  2018  for  a
       residence  card  on  the  basis  of  retained  rights  upon  divorce,
       following the issue of a decree absolute  on  5  January  2018.  That
       application was refused by the respondent  in  a  decision  dated  12
       April 2018, on the basis that the appellant had not provided adequate
       evidence that his EEA national former spouse was a  qualified  person
       or had a right of permanent residence on the date of the  termination
       of the marriage. The respondent considered  that  he  could  only  be
       satisfied,  from  the  evidence  produced,  that  the   sponsor   was
       exercising treaty rights from 1 April 2014 to 19 August 2017, but not
       on the date of divorce on 5 January 2018.

    6. The appellant appealed against both the removal decision of 17 August
       2017 and the decision of 18 April 2018 and the  appeals  were  linked
       and heard together before Judge Callow in the First-tier Tribunal  on
       9  November  2018,  the   former   with   appeal   reference   number
       EA/07335/2017 and the latter with the reference EA/03221/2018.

    7.  Judge  Callow  concluded,  from  the  evidence  in  the  immigration
       officers' notes of the enforcement visit of 17 August 2017, that  the
       appellant's marriage was one of convenience and  that  the  appellant
       had ceased to have a right to reside under the Regulations. The judge
       did not consider it necessary, in the circumstances, to  address  the
       second decision. He dismissed both appeals.

    8. Following a grant of permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  in
       regard to both appeals, the matter came before us on 2  August  2019.
       With respect to the first appeal, EA/07335/2017, we set  aside  Judge
       Callow's decision and re-made the decision by allowing the appeal  on
       the basis that the respondent's decision was not in  accordance  with
       the EEA Regulations 2016. That decision is appended  at  the  end  of
       this decision as Appendix 1.

    9. In relation to this appeal, arising from the  decision  of  12  April
       2018, it was agreed that the Tribunal had still to be satisfied  that
       the appellant's EEA national sponsor  was  exercising  treaty  rights
       from 20 August 2017 to 4  September  2017  (it  was  noted  that  the
       respondent had accepted, in the refusal decision of  12  April  2018,
       that the sponsor was exercising treaty rights until 19 August  2017).
       We therefore we set aside Judge Callow's decision in the  appellant's
       appeal against the respondent's decision of 12 April 2018,  owing  to
       his failure to deal with the matters relevant to the question of  the
       appellant having retained a right  of  residence  upon  divorce,  and
       directed that the matter be listed for a resumed hearing  on  another
       date. Both  parties  were  directed  to  produce  skeleton  arguments
       addressing the issue of the appellant's retained rights of residence,
       with specific  reference  to  the  sponsor's  employment  during  the
       relevant period of 20  August  2017  to  4  September  2017  and  the
       sponsor's ability to meet the primary  earnings  threshold  (PET),  a
       matter that had been raised before Judge Callow, but not addressed by
       him. That decision is  appended  at  the  end  of  this  decision  as
       Appendix 2 (referenced as EA/03221/2017 in error).

   10. The matter then came before us on 19 September 2019.

   11. In his skeleton argument produced for the hearing Mr Iqbal  submitted
       that the only issue  remaining  to  be  determined  was  whether  the
       sponsor's employment,  from  20  August  to  4  September  2017,  was
       considered to be sufficient for her to  be  accepted  as  a  "worker"
       under the EEA Regulations, given that she was earning less  than  the
       PET. He relied upon the case of D.M.  Levin  v  Staatssecretaris  van
       Justitie [1982] EUECJ R-53/81 in submitting that marginal income  was
       sufficient to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  EEA  Regulations,
       provided that the employment from which it was derived was  effective
       and genuine. He submitted that it had already been  accepted  by  the
       respondent that the sponsor's  employment  and  self-employment  were
       effective and genuine. He based that conclusion upon  the  concession
       made by the Home Office Presenting Officer before First-tier Tribunal
       Judge Callow, as recorded at [11] of the  judge's  decision,  whereby
       the  Presenting  Officer  apparently  accepted   that   the   divorce
       proceedings had been instituted at a time when  the  sponsor  was  in
       employment. Mr Iqbal submitted that Mr Bramble's understanding of the
       only outstanding issue, in his skeleton argument, namely whether  the
       sponsor was exercising treaty rights as a worker from 20 August  2017
       to 4 September 2017,  was  therefore  incorrect  as  it  ignored  the
       concession previously made by the respondent.

   12. We asked Mr Bramble to  clarify  whether  there  had  been  a  formal
       concession by the respondent on that basis, as Judge Callow's  record
       of the submissions, at [11], was not entirely clear to us. It was not
       initially  clear  from   Mr   Bramble's   submissions   whether   the
       respondent's position was that the sponsor was self-employed  at  the
       relevant time but had failed to show that her employment was  genuine
       and effective, or whether it was not accepted at  all  that  she  was
       self-employed. Mr Bramble clarified that  the  respondent's  position
       was that the appellant had failed to  show  that  his  ex-spouse  was
       employed from 20 August 2017 until 4 September 2017. He  referred  to
       the HMRC statement dated 21 November 2017 at pages 12 and 13  of  the
       appellant's bundle of documents which  confirmed  no  self-assessment
       tax record being held for the sponsor for the tax years 2015 to  2017
       and no current employment record subsequent to  the  sponsor  ceasing
       employment on 31 July 2017. He also referred to  the  HMRC  statement
       dated 22 June 2018 at pages 91 and 92 of  the  bundle  confirming  no
       HMRC self-assessment tax record held for the sponsor for the tax year
       2017-18 and referring to the sponsor's income of �3164.84 in the  tax
       year 2017-18 from the employment which had ended  on  31  July  2017.
       With regard to the �4,676 income from self-employment declared in the
       tax return at page 13 and 24, Mr Bramble submitted that that was  not
       supported by any evidence in the form of wage slips, bank statements,
       business accounts or billing  invoices.  Mr  Bramble  submitted  that
       there was no acceptable evidence  of  employment  or  self-employment
       after 31 July 2017, but given the concession in  the  refusal  letter
       referring to the date of 19 August 2017 (which appeared simply to  be
       the date of the bank statements produced), he was prepared to  accept
       the relevant disputed period as beginning on 20 August 2017.  He  did
       not agree that any clear concession was made before Judge Callow, but
       that if there was a concession he would resile from it.

   13. Mr Iqbal's submission was that the sponsor's HMRC  records  confirmed
       that she had earned �4,676 from self-employment in the tax year  2017
       to 2018. The  total  from  employment  and  self-employment,  �7,840,
       averaged out at �150.70 a week, which was  below  the  PET  level  of
       �162. Although  the  amount  earned  was  below  the  threshold,  the
       relevant issue was whether the employment was effective and  genuine,
       and that was what had been argued before Judge Callow. There  was  no
       reason to conclude that the income from self-employment was not  from
       genuine employment and therefore the sponsor  was  exercising  treaty
       rights at the relevant time and the appellant met the requirements of
       the EEA Regulations. In  so  far  as  Mr  Bramble  was  calling  into
       question the reliability of the sponsor's tax returns, the burden  of
       proof lay upon the respondent to make  out  an  allegation  of  false
       documents and that burden had  not  been  met  on  the  basis  of  an
       inference, as it could have been that the sponsor's returns submitted
       on 15 May 2018 had simply not yet shown up in the HMRC's records when
       the HMRC statement of 22 June 2018 at page 91 was issued.

Discussion and conclusions

   14. The basis for the appellant's application for a residence card  being
       refused was that he could not satisfy the requirements of  regulation
       10(5)(b) of the EEA Regulations 2016, that he "was  residing  in  the
       United Kingdom in accordance with these Regulations at  the  date  of
       the termination;", the  date  of  termination  being  accepted  as  4
       September 2017. The reason for that was that he could not  show  that
       his former EEA national spouse was exercising treaty rights, and thus
       was a qualified person, or that she had acquired a permanent right of
       residence at that time. The respondent accepted, in his letter of  12
       April 2018, that the sponsor was  exercising  treaty  rights  from  1
       April 2014 to 19 August 2017 but  not  thereafter.  The  date  of  19
       August 2017  appears  to  have  been  taken  from  the  date  of  the
       Nationwide statements produced for the  sponsor  (page  84)  with  no
       indication as to how that demonstrated the exercise of treaty  rights
       at that time, but we have nevertheless taken that date as  the  start
       date of the  relevant  period  under  consideration,  as  Mr  Bramble
       accepted.

   15. It is not in dispute that the sponsor ceased PAYE  employment  on  31
       July 2017. That is confirmed in the HMRC statements from Roger  Drew,
       of 21 November 2017 and 22 June 2018, at pages 12/13 and 91/92 of the
       Tribunal bundle, whereby it is stated that the  sponsor's  employment
       for Javehd Akhtar & Minesh Patel ended on that  date.  The  sponsor's
       income of �3164.84 from that employment, for the tax year 2018-18  is
       confirmed at page 92. The P60s at pages 52 and  53,  and  the  salary
       slips preceding the P60s,  together  with  the  income  and  national
       insurance statement at page 55, confirm that Javehd Akhtar  &  Minesh
       Patel traded as Krystal Express Cannon Street.

   16. What is in dispute is the appellant's claim that the sponsor took  up
       self-employment  as  a  cleaner  following  the  cessation   of   her
       employment with Krystal Express Cannon Street. Mr Iqbal submits  that
       [11] of Judge Callow's  decision  confirms  that  that  was  in  fact
       accepted by the Home Office Presenting Officer in his submissions  at
       the hearing and that the only  issue  arising  in  that  respect  was
       whether the employment was genuine  and  effective,  given  that  the
       level of income fell below the PET. However we do not  consider  that
       we, or the Secretary of State, are bound  by  any  formal  concession
       made by the Home Office Presenting Officer before Judge Callow as  to
       the sponsor exercising treaty rights at the time divorce  proceedings
       were commenced. Firstly, we do not consider that any such  concession
       was  made.  Judge  Callow's  record  of  the   Presenting   Officer's
       submission at [11] is far from clear and  unambiguous.  There  is  no
       other record of a concession having been made. Judge Callow  did  not
       determine the issue and, in any event,  his  decision  has  been  set
       aside. There would, furthermore, be no basis for such a concession as
       there is nothing that Mr Bramble is able to identify that would  have
       led the respondent to  concede  the  matter  and  we  note  that  the
       Presenting Office in fact raised concerns about a lack of  supporting
       evidence. Secondly, we consider that even if there was some  form  of
       concession Mr Bramble is able to resile from it, given  the  lack  of
       clarity as to the nature of the concession and the evidence available
       to the Tribunal.

   17. The only evidence that has been produced  to  support  the  sponsor's
       claimed self-employment, aside from the appellant's own assertion  in
       his statement, is the tax return and confirmation of receipt at pages
       14 to  27  of  the  Tribunal  bundle  showing  the  2018  tax  return
       apparently filed subsequent to the refusal decision of 12 April 2018.
       The filing of such a tax return with HMRC is,  however,  contradicted
       by the statement of Roger Drew at page 91  confirming  that  no  HMRC
       self-assessment tax record was held for [GV] for the tax  year  2017-
       18.  Mr Iqbal submitted that the Tribunal could not conclude that the
       respondent had proved that the tax return was  false  purely  on  the
       basis of an inference arising from  Roger  Drew's  statement,  as  it
       could be that HMRC records had not yet been  updated  by  that  time.
       However we consider the statement from  Mr  Drew  to  be  strong  and
       cogent evidence that the HMRC documents at pages 14 to  27  were  not
       reliable evidence. The appellant claims that the tax return was  sent
       to him by email from his ex-spouse, but there is no evidence of  that
       and there is therefore no evidence as to how he came to have the  tax
       records.

   18. In any event the tax return, even if actually filed, is no more  than
       the sponsor's statement about her circumstances, and pages 14 and  27
       are simply confirmation by the HMRC of  receipt  of  the  information
       from the sponsor. The information  provided  in  the  tax  return  is
       limited, and we note for example that on page 8/11 of the form  (page
       23 of the Tribunal bundle) at question 2 there is no business address
       and at question 5, there is no entry for a commencement date for  the
       business. There is, furthermore, not one item of supporting  evidence
       of the business. There are no receipts, no business accounts, no bank
       statements showing deposits specifically attributable to a  business.
       Indeed the appellant's evidence during  the  immigration  enforcement
       visit to his home on 17 August 2017 was that at that  time  his  wife
       was working for Krystal Express, whereas the evidence  now  available
       from HMRC shows that she left that employment on  31  July  2017.  He
       sought to explain that in his statement, by claiming that he had only
       found out about her self-employment  subsequent  to  the  enforcement
       visit, but we reject that claim. The appellant has proved himself  to
       be  a  wholly  unreliable  witness,  having  clearly  lied   to   the
       immigration officers during the enforcement visit, and  we  therefore
       give no weight to his statement.

   19. In the circumstances we find there to be no reliable evidence of  the
       sponsor working beyond 31 July 2017. We do not accept  that  she  was
       self-employed as a cleaner  after  leaving  Krystal  Express  and  we
       reject the claim that she was exercising  treaty  rights  between  20
       August 2017 and 4 September 2017. We  do  not  accept  that  she  was
       either a qualified person or had acquired permanent residence at  the
       time of the commencement of divorce  proceedings.  Indeed  we  cannot
       even be satisfied that she remained in the UK, given the  appellant's
       claim at the time of the enforcement visit that she was in Hungary at
       that time and the lack of any reliable evidence that she had returned
       to the UK.

   20. Accordingly the appellant has failed to show that he is able to  meet
       the requirements of regulation 10(5)(b) of the EEA Regulations  2016.
       We do not accept that he is a family member who has retained a  right
       of residence in the UK. His appeal against the respondent's  decision
       of 12 April 2018 is therefore dismissed.

DECISION

   21. The original Tribunal was found to have made an error of law and  the
       decision has been set aside. We re-make the  decision  by  dismissing
       the appellant's appeal under the EEA Regulations 2016.

For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal, instructed by Rainbow Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal is linked to another appeal, EA/03221/2018, to the extent
       that the decisions in both appeals relate to the same  appellant  and
       were both heard, together, before First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow on
       9 November 2018. This appeal relates to the first of the respondent's
       decisions, dated 17 August 2017, to remove the appellant from the  UK
       under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016  in
       accordance with section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, by
       virtue of regulations 23(6)(a) and 32(2), and pursuant to  regulation
       36 of the Regulations. EA/03221/2018 relates to a subsequent decision
       of the respondent, dated 12  April  2018,  to  refuse  to  issue  the
       appellant with an EEA residence card as the former family  member  of
       an EEA national who had retained a right of residence in the UK  upon
       divorce. For reasons which are apparent from the  decisions  we  have
       made, we have issued separate decisions for each appeal. Both should,
       however, be read together.

    2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born  on  10  June  1982.  He
       arrived in the UK on 5 October 2010 with leave to enter as a  Tier  4
       student migrant valid until 22 February 2012. He was granted  further
       leave to remain until 10 April 2015 on the same basis, but that leave
       was subsequently curtailed  to  expire  on  27  September  2014.  The
       appellant met  his  EEA  sponsor,  [GV],  a  Hungarian  national,  in
       February 2013 and they were married on 21 February 2014. On 11  April
       2014 the appellant applied for an EEA residence card  as  the  family
       member (spouse) of an EEA national. His application was refused on 18
       July 2014 on the basis that he was not the family member  of  an  EEA
       national, since he had entered into a marriage of  convenience.  That
       decision was based upon the outcome of a  visit  to  the  appellant's
       given address by immigration officers which  concluded  that  neither
       the appellant nor his spouse had ever resided there.

    3. The appellant appealed against that decision. His appeal was heard on
       11 February 2015 before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  O'Garro.  Neither
       the appellant nor his spouse attended to give oral evidence but  they
       provided written statements, in which the appellant claimed  to  have
       moved to another address with his spouse  shortly  after  making  his
       application, in June 2014, and had forgotten to inform the respondent
       of his change of address. He produced evidence of their residence  at
       both addresses. The judge accepted,  from  that  evidence,  that  the
       appellant and his spouse had  been  living  together  at  the  former
       address in February and March 2014 and at the new  address  since  at
       least 4 July 2014. The judge concluded on the basis of that  evidence
       that the appellant's marriage was genuine and she allowed the appeal.

    4. There is no evidence before us to show that the respondent sought  to
       appeal that decision and a residence card was issued to the appellant
       on 5 March 2015, valid for five years until 5 March 2020.

    5. On 17 August 2017 a visit was made by  immigration  officers  to  the
       appellant's home. The notes of that visit  have  been  produced.  The
       immigration officers noted no evidence of the EEA national's presence
       in the property. They noted that the appellant  was  sharing  a  room
       with another male and there was no evidence of any female clothing or
       belongings in the room.  The  immigration  officers  considered  that
       messages on the appellant's mobile telephone from his wife  were  not
       affectionate and did not appear to be messages between  partners  but
       gave the impression of an arrangement. The appellant claimed that his
       wife had gone to Hungary for a visit and was due back  on  22  August
       2017 and that they were  still  together.  The  immigration  officers
       considered there to be  no  satisfactory  evidence  of  a  subsisting
       relationship.  They  arrested  the  appellant  and  took   him   into
       detention. The appellant was served with removal papers under section
       10 of the 1999 Act on the basis that he did not have, or  had  ceased
       to have, a right to reside under the 2016 Regulations.

    6. The notice of liability to removal served on the appellant  confirmed
       that removal was considered on the basis that he was:

           "A)   by virtue of regulations 23(6)(a) and 32(2)  a  person  in
                respect  of  whom  removal  directions  may  be   given   in
                accordance with section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act
                1999 as:

                    a person who does not have or who has ceased to  have  a
                    right to reside under the Immigration (European Economic
                    Area) Regulations 2016."

    7. The "Specific Statement of Reasons" given in the notice of  liability
       to removal served on the appellant stated as follows:

           "You are specifically considered a person  who  has  engaged  in
           conduct  which  appears  to  be  intended  to   circumvent   the
           requirement to be a qualified person, because you  were  granted
           leave on the basis of a relationship with an EU  national,  when
           encountered you were unable to give a credible  account  of  any
           subsisting relationship  with  the  claimed  partner.  You  also
           failed to give satisfactory evidence of the claimed relationship
           or the absence of your partner."

    8. That was followed by a Decision to Remove in accordance with  section
       10 of the 1999 Act, which applied by virtue of  regulations  26(6)(a)
       and 32(2) of the EEA Regulations, dated 17  August  2017,  the  first
       decision under appeal.

    9. Subsequent to that decision, which had the effect of  curtailing  the
       appellant's  right  of  residence  under  the  EEA  Regulations,  the
       appellant made a further application for a residence card  under  the
       EEA Regulations  on  the  basis  of  the  same  relationship,  on  11
       September 2017, by which time he had been released on bail.  In  that
       application he stated that he was separated from his sponsor and that
       divorce proceedings were being pursued. He produced  a  petition  for
       divorce dated 4 September 2017. The application  was  refused  on  11
       December 2017, on the basis that he had failed to provide a valid  ID
       card or passport for his sponsor and that his application  could  not
       be considered as one for a retained right of residence as  there  was
       no decree absolute. The decision was not an appealable one.

   10. The appellant then made an application  on  23  January  2018  for  a
       residence  card  on  the  basis  of  retained  rights  upon  divorce,
       following the issue of a decree absolute  on  5  January  2018.  That
       application was refused by the respondent  in  a  decision  dated  12
       April 2018, which is the second decision under appeal in the case  of
       EA/03221/2018.  In  that  decision  the  respondent  noted  that  the
       evidence demonstrated that the appellant's marriage had  lasted  over
       three years and that he and the EEA national sponsor had  both  lived
       in the UK for at least one year during their marriage. The respondent
       was also satisfied that  the  appellant  had  continued  to  exercise
       treaty rights as an EEA national  since  the  date  of  the  divorce.
       However the respondent considered that the appellant had not provided
       adequate evidence that his EEA national former spouse was a qualified
       person or had a right of permanent  residence  on  the  date  of  the
       termination of the marriage. The respondent considered that he  could
       only be satisfied, from the evidence produced, that the  sponsor  was
       exercising treaty rights from 1 April 2014 to 19 August 2017 but  not
       on the date of divorce on 5 January  2018.  The  respondent  made  it
       clear that the genuineness of the former relationship  had  not  been
       considered, given that the application failed on the first basis, but
       noting that the appellant had an outstanding appeal in regard to  the
       genuineness of the former relationship.

   11. The appellant appealed against both decisions and, as  stated  above,
       the appeals were linked and heard together before Judge Callow in the
       First-tier Tribunal on 9 November 2018.

   12. Judge Callow  considered  the  appeals  on  the  basis  that  it  was
       apparent, from the respondent's decision, based upon the  immigration
       officers' note, that the respondent believed the appellant's marriage
       to be one of  convenience.  The  judge  noted  from  the  appellant's
       statement that he was claiming to have separated from his wife on  15
       July 2017 and that that was the reason why she was not present at the
       immigration officers' visit in August 2017. The judge  rejected  that
       claim and concluded, from the evidence in the  immigration  officers'
       note, that the marriage was one of convenience and that the appellant
       had ceased to have a right to reside under the Regulations. The judge
       did not consider it necessary to address the second  decision,  given
       his finding that the marriage was one of  convenience.  He  dismissed
       both appeals.

   13. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  in
       regard to both appeals on the basis that it was not open to the judge
       to find that the marriage was one of convenience. The grounds  assert
       that the respondent  had  only  stated  that  the  marriage  was  not
       subsisting on 17 August 2017 and there had been no  consideration  by
       the judge of the appellant's intentions at the time of the marriage.

   14.  Permission  was  refused  in  the  First-tier   Tribunal   but   was
       subsequently granted in the Upper Tribunal on 20 March 2019 by  Judge
       Chalkley.

   15. The matter then came before us. We  made  some  initial  observations
       before hearing from the parties in relation to both appeals. As  each
       raises different issues, we address in this decision only the matters
       related to the appeal against the removal decision of 17 August 2017.

   16. We put it to Mr Bramble that we could not see  how  he  was  able  to
       defend the respondent's decision of 17 August 2017. The decision  had
       been made with reference to regulation 23(6)(a)  on  the  basis  that
       "that person does not have or ceases to have a right to reside  under
       these Regulations". The reason given for the decision was that it was
       not accepted that the appellant's relationship  was  subsisting,  but
       that was not a requirement of the EEA Regulations. The relevant issue
       under the Regulations was whether the marriage,  when  entered  into,
       had been one of convenience  at  that  time,  and  the  Tribunal  had
       previously found that it was not. Mr Iqbal confirmed  that  that  was
       the appellant's case in the appeal before us.

   17. We gave Mr  Bramble  some  time  to  consider  our  observations.  He
       accepted that Judge Callow had erred in law by failing to  bring  the
       findings of the previous Tribunal into play in regard to the marriage
       not being one of convenience, but he submitted that the  case  should
       be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for the  decision  to  be  re-
       made. His response to our view of the respondent's  removal  decision
       itself was that the  decision  was  based  on  a  misuse  of  rights.
       Although he agreed that the reasons given differed from a  conclusion
       of a marriage of convenience, he submitted that the reasons stated as
       much indirectly and that the inference had to be that the refusal was
       made on the basis of the marriage being one of  convenience.  We  did
       not agree with Mr Bramble and we proceeded to make a decision setting
       aside Judge Callow's decision and re-making the decision by  allowing
       the appeal. Our reasons, as  we  explained  to  Mr  Bramble,  are  as
       follows.

The relevant legal provisions

   18. So far as is relevant, the EEA Regulations 2016 state as follows:

           "Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom


           23.-

           (6)   Subject to paragraphs (7) and (8), an EEA national who has
           entered the United Kingdom  or  the  family  member  of  such  a
           national who has entered the United Kingdom may be removed if-

                (a)    that person does not have or ceases to have  a  right
                to reside under these Regulations;

                (b)    the Secretary of State has decided that the  person's
                removal is justified on grounds  of  public  policy,  public
                security or public health in accordance with regulation  27;
                or

                (c)    the Secretary of State has decided that the  person's
                removal is justified on grounds of misuse  of  rights  under
                regulation 26(3)."

           "Misuse of a right to reside


           26.-

           (3)   The Secretary of State may take an  EEA  decision  on  the
           grounds of misuse of rights where there are  reasonable  grounds
           to  suspect  the  misuse  of  a  right  to  reside  and  it   is
           proportionate to do so. "

           "Person subject to removal


           32.-

           (2)   Where a  decision  is  taken  to  remove  a  person  under
           regulation 23(6)(a) or (c), the person is to be  treated  as  if
           the person were a person to whom section 10(1) of the  1999  Act
           applies, and section 10 of that Act (removal of certain  persons
           unlawfully in the United Kingdom) is to apply accordingly."

Findings and reasons

   19. Whilst the notice of immigration decision dated 17 August 2017 giving
       rise to the appeal refers to regulations  23(6)(a)/23(6)(c)  pursuant
       to regulation 26(3) and 32(2) of the EEA Regulations as alternatives,
       the notice of liability to removal makes it absolutely clear that the
       decision was made under 23(6)(a) of the Regulations (ceasing to  have
       a right to reside) and not 23(6)(c) (misuse of rights). Therefore  we
       cannot accept Mr Bramble's suggestion  that  this  was  a  misuse  of
       rights decision.

   20. Neither can we accept  his  suggestion  that  the  inference  of  the
       decision is that the refusal was based on  the  appellant's  marriage
       being one of convenience, when the wording of the decision is clearly
       focussed on the question of a  subsisting  relationship.  We  do  not
       dispute that the respondent was entitled to have concerns  about  the
       appellant's relationship given the apparently  inconsistent  evidence
       about his wife's whereabouts and his living arrangements. However the
       decision  was  made  on  the  basis  of   the   appellant's   current
       circumstances, with no reference to the  marriage  initially  entered
       into having been one of convenience. Had the decision been  one  made
       under the immigration rules the question of the subsisting nature  of
       the relationship would of course have been entirely relevant  to  the
       appellant's eligibility for continued leave  to  remain  in  the  UK.
       However  that  was  not  a  relevant  consideration  under  the   EEA
       Regulations, where the appellant was entitled to continue  to  reside
       in the UK whatever the state of his relationship,  provided  that  he
       was still married to his EEA national sponsor and that  the  marriage
       itself had not been one of convenience when entered into. It  may  be
       that the respondent  has  proper  reasons  for  concluding  that  the
       marriage was one of convenience, and that the  previous  decision  of
       Judge O'Garro based on the evidence before her has been displaced  by
       further evidence relating to the marriage at the time it was  entered
       into, but that was not the case before the judge, it was not provided
       as the basis for  the  removal  decision  and  it  cannot  simply  be
       inferred from the reasons given in the removal decision.

   21. Accordingly it seems to us that the respondent's decision was not one
       which was correctly and lawfully made under the EEA  Regulations  and
       that the decision is simply  unsustainable  and  indefensible.  Judge
       Callow erred in law by considering it to be one lawfully  made  under
       the EEA Regulations and by considering  that  a  decision,  that  the
       marriage was one of convenience, was open to him  to  make,  when  it
       clearly was not.

   22. For all these reasons we set aside Judge Callow's  decision  and  re-
       make the decision by allowing the appellant's  appeal  on  the  basis
       that the respondent's decision was not in  accordance  with  the  EEA
       Regulations 2016.



DECISION

   23. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  an
       error on a point of law. We set aside  the  decision  and  allow  the
       appellant's appeal under the EEA Regulations 2016.

For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal, instructed by Rainbow Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal is linked to another appeal, EA/07335/2017, to the extent
       that the decisions in both appeals relate to the same  appellant  and
       were both heard, together, before First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow on
       9  November  2018.  This  appeal  relates  to  the  second   of   the
       respondent's decisions, dated 12 April 2018, to refuse to  issue  the
       appellant with an EEA residence card as the former family  member  of
       an EEA national who had retained a right of residence in the UK  upon
       divorce.  EA/07335/2017  relates  to  a  previous  decision  of   the
       respondent, dated 17 August 2017, to remove the appellant from the UK
       under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016  in
       accordance with section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, by
       virtue of regulations 23(6)(a) and 32(2), and pursuant to  regulation
       36 of the Regulations.  For  reasons  which  are  apparent  from  the
       decisions we have made, we have issued separate  decisions  for  each
       appeal. Both should, however, be read together.

    2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born  on  10  June  1982.  He
       arrived in the UK on 5 October 2010 with leave to enter as a  Tier  4
       student migrant valid until 22 February 2012. He was granted  further
       leave to remain until 10 April 2015 on the same basis, but that leave
       was subsequently curtailed  to  expire  on  27  September  2014.  The
       appellant met  his  EEA  sponsor,  [GV],  a  Hungarian  national,  in
       February 2013 and they were married on 21 February 2014. On 11  April
       2014 the appellant applied for an EEA residence card  as  the  family
       member (spouse) of an EEA national. His application was refused on 18
       July 2014 on the basis that he was not the family member  of  an  EEA
       national since he had entered into a marriage  of  convenience.  That
       decision was based upon the outcome of a  visit  to  the  appellant's
       given address by immigration officers which  concluded  that  neither
       the appellant nor his spouse had ever resided there.

    3. The appellant appealed against that decision. His appeal was heard on
       11 February 2015 before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  O'Garro.  Neither
       the appellant nor his spouse attended to give oral evidence but  they
       provided written statements, in which the appellant claimed  to  have
       moved to another address with his spouse  shortly  after  making  his
       application, in June 2014, and had forgotten to inform the respondent
       of his change of address. He produced evidence of their residence  at
       both addresses. The judge accepted,  from  that  evidence,  that  the
       appellant and his spouse had  been  living  together  at  the  former
       address in February and March 2014 and at the new  address  since  at
       least 4 July 2014. The judge concluded on the basis of that  evidence
       that the appellant's marriage was genuine and she allowed the appeal.

    4. There is no evidence before us to show that the respondent sought  to
       appeal that decision and a residence card was issued to the appellant
       on 5 March 2015, valid for five years until 5 March 2020.

    5. On 17 August 2017 a visit was made by  immigration  officers  to  the
       appellant's home. The notes of that visit  have  been  produced.  The
       immigration officers noted no evidence of the EEA national's presence
       in the property. They noted that the appellant  was  sharing  a  room
       with another male and there was no evidence of any female clothing or
       belongings in the room.  The  immigration  officers  considered  that
       messages on the appellant's mobile telephone from his wife  were  not
       affectionate and did not appear to be messages between  partners  but
       gave the impression of an arrangement. The appellant claimed that his
       wife had gone to Hungary for a visit and was due back  on  22  August
       2017 and that they were  still  together.  The  immigration  officers
       considered there to be  no  satisfactory  evidence  of  a  subsisting
       relationship.  They  arrested  the  appellant  and  took   him   into
       detention. The appellant was served with removal papers under section
       10 of the 1999 Act on the basis that he did not have, or  had  ceased
       to have, a right to reside under the 2016 Regulations.

    6. The notice of liability to removal served on the appellant  confirmed
       that removal was considered on the basis that he was:

           "A)   by virtue of regulations 23(6)(a) and 32(2)  a  person  in
                respect  of  whom  removal  directions  may  be   given   in
                accordance with section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act
                1999 as:

                    a person who does not have or who has ceased to  have  a
                    right to reside under the Immigration (European Economic
                    Area) Regulations 2016."

    7. The "Specific Statement of Reasons" given in the notice of  liability
       to removal served on the appellant stated as follows:

           "You are specifically considered a person  who  has  engaged  in
           conduct  which  appears  to  be  intended  to   circumvent   the
           requirement to be a qualified person, because you  were  granted
           leave on the basis of a relationship with an EU  national,  when
           encountered you were unable to give a credible  account  of  any
           subsisting relationship  with  the  claimed  partner.  You  also
           failed to give satisfactory evidence of the claimed relationship
           or the absence of your partner."

    8. That was followed by a Decision to Remove in accordance with  section
       10 of the 1999 Act, which applied by virtue of  regulations  26(6)(a)
       and 32(2) of the EEA Regulations, dated 17  August  2017,  the  first
       decision under appeal, in EA/07335/2017.

    9. Subsequent to that decision, which had the effect of  curtailing  the
       appellant's  right  of  residence  under  the  EEA  Regulations,  the
       appellant made a further application for a residence card  under  the
       EEA Regulations  on  the  basis  of  the  same  relationship,  on  11
       September 2017, by which time he had been released on bail.  In  that
       application he stated that he was separated from his sponsor and that
       divorce proceedings were being pursued. He produced  a  petition  for
       divorce dated 4 September 2017. The application  was  refused  on  11
       December 2017, on the basis that he had failed to provide a valid  ID
       card or passport for his sponsor and that his application  could  not
       be considered as one for a retained right of residence as  there  was
       no decree absolute. The decision was not an appealable one.

   10. The appellant then made an application  on  23  January  2018  for  a
       residence  card  on  the  basis  of  retained  rights  upon  divorce,
       following the issue of a decree absolute  on  5  January  2018.  That
       application was refused by the respondent  in  a  decision  dated  12
       April 2018, which is the second decision  under  appeal  and  is  the
       subject of this appeal. In that decision the  respondent  noted  that
       the evidence demonstrated that the appellant's  marriage  had  lasted
       over three years and that he and the EEA national  sponsor  had  both
       lived in the UK for at least one  year  during  their  marriage.  The
       respondent was also satisfied that the  appellant  had  continued  to
       exercise treaty rights as an EEA  national  since  the  date  of  the
       divorce. However the respondent considered that the appellant had not
       provided adequate evidence that his EEA national former spouse was  a
       qualified person or had a right of permanent residence on the date of
       the termination of the marriage. The respondent  considered  that  he
       could only be satisfied, from the evidence produced, that the sponsor
       was exercising treaty rights from 1 April 2014 to 19 August 2017  but
       not on the date of divorce on 5 January 2018. The respondent made  it
       clear that the genuineness of the former relationship  had  not  been
       considered, given that the application failed on the first basis, but
       noting that the appellant had an outstanding appeal in regard to  the
       genuineness of the former relationship.

   11. The appellant appealed against both decisions and, as  stated  above,
       the appeals were linked and heard together before Judge Callow in the
       First-tier Tribunal on 9 November 2018.

   12. Judge Callow  considered  the  appeals  on  the  basis  that  it  was
       apparent, from the respondent's decision, based upon the  immigration
       officers' note, that the respondent believed the appellant's marriage
       to be one of  convenience.  The  judge  noted  from  the  appellant's
       statement that he was claiming to have separated from his wife on  15
       July 2017 and that that was the reason why she was not present at the
       immigration officers' visit in August 2017. The judge  rejected  that
       claim and concluded, from the evidence in the  immigration  officers'
       note, that the marriage was one of convenience and that the appellant
       had ceased to have a right to reside under the Regulations. The judge
       did not consider it necessary to address the second  decision,  given
       his finding that the marriage was one of  convenience.  He  dismissed
       both appeals.

   13. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  in
       regard to both appeals on the basis that it was not open to the judge
       to find that the marriage was one of convenience. The grounds  assert
       that the respondent  had  only  stated  that  the  marriage  was  not
       subsisting on 17 August 2017 and there had been no  consideration  by
       the judge of the appellant's intentions at the time of the marriage.

   14.  Permission  was  refused  in  the  First-tier   Tribunal   but   was
       subsequently granted in the Upper Tribunal on 20 March 2019 by  Judge
       Chalkley.

   15. The matter then came before us. We  made  some  initial  observations
       before hearing from the parties in  relation  to  both  appeals.  The
       observations we made relevant to the respondent's first  decision  of
       17  August  2017  are  set  out  in  detail  in   our   decision   in
       EA/07335/2017. In that decision, we set aside Judge Callow's decision
       and re-made the decision by allowing the appeal on the basis that the
       respondent's decision was not in accordance with the EEA  Regulations
       2016.

   16. In relation to this appeal, arising from the  decision  of  12  April
       2018, both parties agreed that there were separate issues still to be
       determined which were not affected by our decision  in  EA/07335/2017
       and which had not been dealt with by Judge Callow.

   17. Mr Bramble submitted that the Tribunal had still to be satisfied that
       the appellant's EEA national sponsor  was  exercising  treaty  rights
       from July 2017 to 4 September 2017 when the divorce proceedings  were
       initiated. Mr Iqbal submitted that the  respondent,  in  the  refusal
       decision, had wrongly considered the date of the decree  absolute,  5
       January 2018, as the relevant date, whereas the relevant date  was  4
       September 2017. He submitted that the starting point for the relevant
       period to be considered was not July 2017 but  was  19  August  2017,
       since the respondent had accepted, in  the  refusal  decision  of  12
       April 2018, that the sponsor was exercising treaty rights until  that
       date. The judge had failed to deal with the respondent's  submission,
       at the hearing, that the sponsor had not met  the  "primary  earnings
       threshold" in accordance with the Home Office  guidance  of  24  July
       2018 referred to at [11] of his decision. Mr  Iqbal  asked  that  the
       decision be re-made at a resumed hearing  to  enable  him  to  submit
       further evidence in that regard.

   18. Accordingly we set aside Judge Callow's decision in  the  appellant's
       appeal against the respondent's decision of 12 April 2018,  since  he
       had failed to deal with the matters relevant to the question  of  the
       appellant having retained a right  of  residence  upon  divorce.  The
       matter will be listed for a resumed hearing on 19 September 2019, for
       the decision to be re-made in the appellant's appeal.

   19. We make the following directions for the resumed hearing:

  Directions

       Not later than 14 days before the resumed hearing:

        a. Any further evidence relied upon by either party is to be  filed
           with the Upper Tribunal and served upon the  other  party  in  a
           consolidated, indexed and paginated bundle

        b. Both parties are to file with the Upper Tribunal, and  serve  on
           the other party, a skeleton argument addressing the issue of the
           appellant's  retained  rights  of   residence,   with   specific
           reference to the sponsor's employment during the relevant period
           of 20 August 2017 to 4 September 2017 and the sponsor's  ability
           to meet the primary earnings threshold.
