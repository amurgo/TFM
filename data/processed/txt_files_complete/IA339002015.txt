                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan.   He  has  permission  to
    challenge the decision of First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) Judge NMK Lawrence
    sent on 2 January 2017 dismissing his appeal against a decision made by
    the respondent on 26 October 2015 refusing him leave to remain  as  the
    partner of a British citizen.

2.   In 2014 the respondent found the appellant  had  used  deception  in  a
    previous  application  namely  an  English  language  test  certificate
    submitted with an application he made on 13 December 2012 relating to a
    test he said he took on 17 July 2012 at New College of Finance.   As  a
    result, the respondent considered he did  not  meet  the  'suitability'
    requirements of Appendix  FM.   The  appellant's  appeal  against  that
    decision was allowed by the judge on the basis that the respondent  had
    not discharged the burden  of  proof  regarding  the  deception  point.
    Noting  that  the  respondent  had  not  considered   the   substantive
    requirements of Appendix  FM,  the  judge  remitted  the  case  to  the
    respondent for a decision on those.  The respondent then issued a fresh
    decision dated 26 October 2015 again finding that the appellant did not
    meet the suitability requirement.  The new  refusal  decision  did  not
    explain why the decision had been taken to  disregard  Judge  Baldwin's
    finding on the deception issue and simply referred  to  information  it
    had received from ETS saying the test he took had been recorded by  ETS
    as 'invalid'.  Shortly before the hearing before  Judge  Lawrence,  the
    respondent adduced a witness statement from a Home Office officer Ms  L
    Singh stating that the test taken by the appellant had been recorded as
    'invalid'.

3.   Judge Lawrence noted that the evidence from  Ms  L  Singh  should  have
    been disclosed at least in the course of the previous  appeal  or  soon
    after and that  the  respondent  had  not  appealed  the  previous  FtT
    decision.   He  noted  the  submission  of  Mr  Richardson  (who   also
    represented on that occasion)  that  unless  exceptional  circumstances
    existed,  which  prevented  the  respondent  from  disclosing  it,  the
    Tribunal should not admit this evidence.

4.   Notwithstanding this submission, the judge not only  decided  to  admit
    this evidence but to treat it as the  basis  for  concluding  that  the
    appellant had used deception in 2012.  The judge's reasons are set  out
    in paras 14 - 17 as follows:

         "14. I have to consider the interest of  justice  when  determining
             whether I  should  receive  and  act  on  the  evidence.   The
             evidence goes to the 'suitability' requirement under  Appendix
             FM.  Should the late submission of such  a  crucial  piece  of
             evidence prejudice the respondent's case.  It  appears  to  me
             that the appellant was notified when  the  respondent  refused
             the  appellant's  marriage  application.   The  date  of  that
             DECISION is dated 11.11.14.  There is  no  evidence  that  the
             appellant made any enquiries with New College of  Finance  why
             his test certificate  had  been  declared  invalid.   I  fully
             accept that it is for the respondent to provide the  evidence.
             However, in the circumstances where  a  test  certificate  has
             been declared invalid, I would have thought it prudent for the
             appellant to start making enquiries with the test centre.  The
             allegation made by the respondent is so specific.  It is  that
             the test he took at New College of  Finance  is  invalid.   It
             could not be clearer  than  that.   This  sufficient  for  the
             appellant to make preliminary enquiries of  the  test  centre.
             It is not  tenable  for  the  appellant  in  these  particular
             circumstances to sit and do nothing.  In these circumstances I
             find it is in the interest of justice to receive the  evidence
             served and lodged in the form 'Resp 2'.


         15.  Mr Lesley Singh's witness statement is dated 20th of  December
             2016.   She  provides  evidence  of  the   voice   recognition
             technology used to identity person who took the  tests.   This
             method discloses voice patterns of  candidates  who  took  the
             test.  If the same voice pattern is identified  in  more  than
             one test than it is evidence that the various tests were taken
             by the same person and not the candidates themselves.  In  the
             instant appeal, it is the respondent's case,  that  the  voice
             pattern technology disclosed the  same  voice  pattern  as  in
             other tests and therefore found the appellant did not take the
             test himself.


         16.  The appellant did not give evidence to  challenge  Ms  Singh's
             evidence.  He did not seek an  adjournment  to  make  his  own
             enquiries.  I note that in his witness statement the appellant
             states he practiced for the  test  on  YouTube,  travelled  to
             London at the cost of �35, paid �160 cash to a  person  called
             Parvez at the New College and 'sat the  speaking  and  writing
             exam on the  17  July  2012'.   He  describes  the  number  of
             computer in the room, the breaks he took, he took the  reading
             and listening test on the 21st July  2012.etc  (see:  'App  1'
             page 3 para  11-18).  The  appellant  also  asserts  that  the
             respondent has failed to  take  into  account  the  medium  of
             instructions in Pakistan is English.  I find the appellant has
             explained what  happened  on  the  days  he  took  the  tests.
             Further, he asserts the medium of instructions in Pakistan  is
             English (see: 'App 1' pages 4-5 para 19).  However,  these  do
             not address the 'deception' point raised  by  the  respondent.
             This is the core of the allegation and not the amount of  fees
             paid, the cost of travel and the like.  In the absence of  the
             any challenge  to  the  core  of  the  appellant  I  find  the
             respondent has provided the Tribunal with sufficient  strength
             and quality which survives critical,  anxious  and  heightened
             scrutiny.  The appellant  has  not  sought  to  challenge  the
             evidence.  Consequently, I find that the  appellant  does  not
             meet the 'suitability' requirement of Appendix FM.


         17.  Mr Richardson submits  that  I  am  bound  by  the  First-tier
             Judge's decision in IA/47780/2014, on the  'deception'  point.
             I find I am able  to  depart  from  it  because  I  have  been
             presented with evidence from Ms Singh and annexure."

5.   The grounds of appeal contend that in  deciding  to  rely  on  the  new
    evidence from Ms L Singh the judge erred in law as the reasons he  gave
    for departure from the findings of fact made by the previous  judge  on
    this same issue were erroneous.  I consider this ground  is  made  out.
    The judge's reasons for departure are contrary to the guidance given by
    the Upper Tribunal in Chomonga (binding effect of unappealed  decision)
    Zimbabwe [2011] UKUT 00312 (IAC) and the Court of Appeal  in  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department UTB (Jamaica) [2008] EWCA Civ 977.  In
    these cases it was confirmed  that  the  respondent  is  bound  by  the
    decision of a Tribunal except where "there is relevant  fresh  evidence
    that was not available at the date of hearing, or a change in the law",
    although this principle has no application  where  "there  is  relevant
    fresh evidence that was not available at the date of the hearing, or  a
    change in the law, and the principle has no application where there  is
    a change of circumstances or there are new events  after  the  date  of
    decision" (per Burnton LJ at para 35 of  TB).

6.   In order to understand why I have concluded that Judge  Lawrence  erred
    it is important to recall what the state of  the  evidence  was  before
    Judge Baldwin.  At para 9 Judge Baldwin records  that  he  declined  to
    adjourn the hearing (in June 2015) so that the respondent could furnish
    three witness statements evidencing the allegation of deception  relied
    on.  Judge Baldwin refused this application because the respondent  had
    already had "nearly 6 months" in which to provide it.   The  judge  did
    have before her a Print-Out which recorded the appellant as having  two
    'individual results' of invalidity.  She considered  that  these  print
    outs did not amount to evidence  of  sufficient  strength  and  quality
    required for an allegation  of  deception.   She  also  considered  the
    appellant's account of the circumstances in which he took the test  and
    considered that it was "improbable that this Appellant would have  used
    deception as he studied in English in Pakistan, his 2014  English  Test
    Certificate was not challenged and his oral mastery of  English  before
    me was notably good." (para 20).

7.    Several observations are pertinent.  First,  the  respondent  did  not
    challenge that decision in any respect. There was no challenge  to  the
    finding as regards the lack of evidence of  deception  or  the  finding
    that the appellant was likely to have had good English at the time.

8.    Second,  neither  in  the  subsequent  refusal  letter  nor   in   the
    submissions before Judge  Lawrence,  did  the  respondent  provide  any
    explanation as to why the missing evidence  could  not  have  been  put
    before Judge Baldwin.  Neither could Mr  Singh  offer  any  explanation
    before me.

9.   Third, the evidence of Ms L Singh did not contain any new evidence;  it
    simply confirmed in the terms set out in para 15  of  Judge  Lawrence's
    decision (see above paragraph 4) that the appellant's test results  had
    been recorded by ETS as invalid.

10.  Fourth, the respondent made no reference in  her  refusal  decision  to
    the significance or  otherwise  of  the  appellant's  good  command  of
    English and  the  improbability  that  he  would  have  needed  to  use
    deception to pass the test.

11.  Fifth, despite stating at paragraph that "[the appellant did  not  give
    evidence  to  challenge  Ms  Singh's  evidence  [he  must   mean   oral
    evidence]"Judge Lawrence proceeded to find in paragraph  16  that  "the
    appellant has explained what happened on the days he took the tests".

12.  It is true Judge Lawrence goes on in the same paragraph to  state  that
    [these particulars about the circumstances under which he  attended  to
    take the tests] "do not address the 'deception'  point  raised  by  the
    respondent" (para 16).   True it is too that these particulars  do  not
    conclusively bear on the deception issue. However, to say they "do  not
    address" the deception point at  all  is  manifestly  contrary  to  the
    guidance given by the Upper Tribunal and Court  of  Appeal  in  SM  and
    Ihsan Qadir v SSHD  [2016]  UKUT  229  IAC)  and  SSHD  v  Shehzad  and
    Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 cases as  regards  the  contents  of  "an
    innocent explanation".

13.  The judge's statement in this same paragraph (16) that  "the  appellant
    has not sought to challenge the evidence" is with respect  contradicted
    by the evidence before the judge which  included  a  statement  by  the
    appellant strongly disputing that he used deception.

14.  I have  no  hesitation  in  concluding  that  in  light  of  the  above
    considerations the judge was wholly wrong to depart from  the  previous
    findings of Judge Baldwin that the allegations  of  deception  had  not
    been proven.  I would add that Judge  Lawrence's  suggestion  that  the
    appellant, prior to the hearing before Judge Baldwin, should have  made
    enquiries of New College, is an odd piece of historic revisiting  of  a
    decision which found that the respondent had not discharged the  burden
    of proof on her to prove deception.

15.  I raised with the parties at the outset  my  concern  that  even  if  I
    found (as I now have) that Judge Lawrence erred on the deception point,
    that could be classified as a material error  given  that  at  para  18
    Judge Lawrence had concluded that the  appellant  had  not  shown  that
    there would be  'insurmountable  obstacles'  to  the  couple  going  to
    Pakistan to enjoy family life there.

16.   Mr  Richardson  submitted  that  Judge  Lawrence's   error   regarding
    deception and suitability was material for  two  reasons.   First,  the
    respondent in the refusal decision had concluded that the appellant met
    all the substantive requirements of the Partner route.  Second the test
    of insurmountable obstacles (and indeed the test of  "very  significant
    obstacles"  under  para  276ADE(1)(iv))  are  not  part  of  the  Rules
    governing eligibility of partners under the partner route Mr Singh  did
    not demur.  I have concluded Mr Richardson is  right  on  both  counts.
    Accordingly I am satisfied the error of the judge was material and that
    his decision should be set aside.

Re-making the Decision

17.  It is unnecessary for  me  to  state  in  any  detail  my  reasons  for
    concluding that the decision I re-make  is  to  allow  the  appellant's
    appeal.  Clearly the respondent had not proved  deception  and  had  no
    basis therefore for finding that  the  appellant  failed  to  meet  the
    'suitability' requirements of the Rules.  Clearly  the  respondent  did
    not consider there was any other basis for refusing to grant  leave  to
    remain under the Partner route.  As a result it  cannot  be  said  that
    there was any public interest in refusing the appellant's  application.
    The  decision  refusing  his   application   was   a   disproportionate
    interference with his right to respect for family life.

To conclude:

18.  The decision of Judge Lawrence is set aside for material error.

19.  The decision I re-make is to allow the appellant's appeal.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
