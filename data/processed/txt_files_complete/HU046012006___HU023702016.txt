                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Andrew (the judge), promulgated on 7 March 2017, in  which
         she concluded that the Appellant did not have a right of appeal  in
         respect of two separate decisions cancelling his leave to enter the
         UK, the first dated 15 January 2015, the second  dated  31  January
         2015.


      2. The Upper Tribunal can entertain  the  appeals  on  the  principles
         established in Abiyat and others (rights  of  appeal)  Iran  [2011]
         UKUT 314 (IAC).


  Factual Background


      3. The Appellant is a national of India, date of birth 26 April  1984.
         He first entered UK as a student on or around 7 September 2006.  He
         was granted further leave to remain until 31 October 2010. On the 2
         October 2010 he applied  for  a  Certificate  of  Approval  to  get
         married, but this was refused on 29 November 2010.  On  30  October
         2010, he made an in-time application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
         student. According to the Respondent the Appellant  failed  to  pay
         the fee for this application as his card payment  was  declined  by
         the card provider. The decision rejecting the  application  on  the
         basis that it was invalid was  made  on  11  January  2011.  It  is
         acknowledged by the Respondent that the Appellant did  not  receive
         this invalidity letter as it appeared to  have  been  lost  in  the
         post. There is some evidence, as detailed in the GCID  Case  Record
         Sheets, that the Appellant contacted the Home Office inquiring  why
         there  had  not  yet  been  a  decision  made  in  respect  of  his
         application.


      4. The Appellant maintains that he met his fianc�e on 1 July 2012 when
         he was present in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  He  claims
         to have left the UK on 9 July 2015. On 6 October  2015  he  applied
         for  entry  clearance  as  a  fianc�  under  Appendix  FM  of   the
         immigration rules. He was granted entry  clearance  on  1  December
         2015. On entry to the UK on  5  December  2015  the  Appellant  was
         interviewed. According to the Respondent the Appellant claimed that
         a previous representative said he "could get someone to marry"  him
         in 2010. The Appellant refused this offer but  the  Certificate  of
         Approval application was made without his consent.


      5. The Respondent did not believe the Appellant told the  truth  when,
         in respect of his entry  clearance  application  as  a  fianc�,  he
         claimed that they met in July 2012 when he had leave to remain as a
         Tier 4  (General)  Student.  The  Respondent  considered  that  the
         Appellant had no leave to from 31 October 2010 until left  in  July
         2015, and that he was aware that he had  no  leave.  She  therefore
         issued him a notice of cancellation of leave to enter on 15 January
         2016.  The  Appellant  sought  an  Administrative  Review  of  this
         decision. The decision was also accompanied by a 'One-Stop Warning'
         served under s.120 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
         2002.


      6. On 21 January 2016, in response to the s.120 Notice, the  Appellant
         issued to the  Respondent  a  'Statement  of  Additional  Grounds'.
         Ground 3 contended that the application to join his fianc�  in  the
         UK was a human rights claim and that he should have  been  given  a
         right of appeal in respect of the  cancellation  decision.  On  the
         same day, the Appellant lodged an appeal (HU/02370/2016)  with  the
         First-tier Tribunal.


      7. In an Administrative Review decision  dated  31  January  2016  the
         Respondent maintained her decision  but  found  that  the  original
         reasons for the cancellation were incomplete and had to be changed.
         The Respondent therefore issued a further decision, also  dated  31
         January  2016,  which  additionally  relied  on  the  inconsistency
         between the account given by the Appellant in his  interview  on  5
         December  2015,  relating  to  the  Certificate  of  Approval   for
         marriage, and the submissions in his  entry  clearance  application
         where he claimed that his relationship with his previous fianc� had
         'broken  down'.  The  Administrative  Review  concluded  that   the
         Appellant did not have a right of appeal as he had not made a human
         rights claim.


      8.  The Appellant nevertheless lodged another  appeal  (HU/04601/2016)
         with the First-tier Tribunal. On 8 February  2016  the  Duty  Judge
         issued a letter in respect of appeal HU/02370/2016 requesting  that
         the Appellant provide a copy of the human rights claim referred  to
         in his grounds within 5 working days. It is not clear to me whether
         there was a response to this letter. Both appeals however appear to
         have passed the Duty Judge 'screening process' and were listed  for
         hearing on 2 March 2017.


  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal


      9. At the hearing, the Presenting Officer submitted that there was  no
         right of appeal as the Appellant was appealing against cancellation
         decisions and had not made  a  human  rights  application.  It  was
         submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the section  120  notices
         contained human rights claims and that there had  been  an  implied
         human rights aspect of the fianc� entry clearance application.


     10. The judge concluded that there was no right of  appeal.  The  judge
         correctly noted  that  rights  of  appeal  were  only  attached  to
         decisions that amounted to refusals of human rights  or  protection
         claims. It was common ground that the  Appellant  had  not  made  a
         protection claim. The judge concluded that the  Appellant  did  not
         make a human rights claim, and relied on the  authority  of  Ali  v
         SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1198 in which it was found that a fresh ground
         of appeal or statement in a response to a section  120  notice  was
         not an application. The judge concluded that the human rights claim
         made in the section 120 notice was not an  application.  The  judge
         additionally  noted  that  it  was  not  one  that  had  ever  been
         specifically refused by the Respondent.


  The grounds of appeal and the error of law hearing


     11. The grounds argued that the section 120  notice  raised  article  8
         considerations and that he had a right of appeal. It was  submitted
         that Ali related to the raising of new points in a PBS  application
         and did not concern human rights claims.
     12. In granting permission judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  L  Murray
         said it was arguable that the Appellant made a human  rights  claim
         within the meaning of Alighanbari, R  (on  the  application  of)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1818 (Admin)
         and jurisdiction should not have been declined.


     13. There was substantial agreement between both parties at  the  error
         of law hearing that a human rights claim had been made and that the
         cancellation decision dated 31 January 2016 amounted to  a  refusal
         of a human rights claim. Mr Bramble, on behalf of  the  Respondent,
         accepted that the Appellant's response to the section  120  notice,
         dated 21 January 2016, raised article 8 at ground  3.  He  accepted
         that, in her decision dated 31 January 2016, the decision-maker had
         before her a human rights claim. Although the Administrative Review
         decision, also dated 31 January 2016, maintained there was no human
         rights claim, and Explanatory Statement prepared in respect of  the
         cancellation decisions did engage with the article 8 points  raised
         by the Appellant and effectively amounted to  a  refusal  on  human
         rights grounds.


     14. Having studied the Explanatory Statement prepared on 1 March  2017,
         which clarified the nature of the Cancellation of  Leave  to  Enter
         decision dated 31 January 2016, and having  proper  regard  to  the
         common ground between the parties, I indicated that I was satisfied
         that the judge did have a human rights claim before  her  and  that
         she materially erred in law in concluding there  was  no  right  of
         appeal.


  Discussion


     15. Sections 113 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 states,


             "human rights claim" means a claim made by a person to the
             Secretary of State at a place designated by the Secretary of
             State that to remove the person from or require him to leave
             the United Kingdom [or to refuse him entry into the United
             Kingdom] would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights
             Act 1998 (c 42) (public authority not to act contrary to
             Convention) . . .


     16. The Respondent's Guidance on 'Rights of Appeal'  indicates  that  a
         fianc� application  does  constitute  a  human  rights  claim.  The
         Appellant's application for entry clearance as a fianc� was however
         granted and that entry clearance had effect as leave to  enter  the
         UK.  Once  a  final  decision  was  made  in   respect   of   entry
         clearance/human rights claim,  the  claim  ceased  to  be  a  claim
         because it had been resolved. It would do violence to  the  natural
         meaning of the word "claim", and the definition contained in s.113,
         if, after a final decision was made in respect of it, it  continued
         to have effect. The decision cancelling the  Appellant's  leave  to
         enter dated 15 January 2016 was not made in response to any  extant
         human rights claim. It therefore did not constitute a refusal of  a
         human rights claim. The appeal lodged in respect of  this  decision
         (HU/02370/2016) was not a valid appeal.


     17. The Respondent however issued a section 120 notice  in  respect  of
         her cancellation decision and, on 21 January 2016, the  Appellant's
         'Statement of Additional Grounds' raised, in  Ground  3,  what  has
         been accepted by the Respondent to amount to a human rights  claim.
         Mr Bramble specifically accepted that, by the 31 January 2016,  the
         Respondent had a human rights  claim  before  her.  The  Respondent
         issued a further Cancellation of Leave  to  Enter  decision  on  31
         January 2016. By reference to and incorporation of the  Explanatory
         Statement, the  Respondent  specifically  engaged  with  the  human
         rights challenge mounted by the Appellant. It was  accepted  by  Mr
         Bramble that the Explanatory Statement, read  in  conjunction  with
         the Cancellation of Leave to Enter,  constituted  a  refusal  of  a
         human rights claim within the scope of  s.82  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It was therefore conceded  by  the
         Respondent that, at least in respect of the Cancellation  of  Leave
         to Enter decision dated 31 January 2016,  this  was  an  appealable
         decision.


     18. Although I did not hear submissions on the  point  I  am  satisfied
         that the judge's reliance on Ali was inappropriate as this case did
         not deal with human rights claims, and the judge  appears  to  have
         conflated a human rights  claim  with  the  issue  that  was  under
         consideration Ali, which was whether an application could  be  made
         in a response to a section 120 notice.  In  any  event,  the  human
         rights claim is conceptually separate from an application under the
         immigration rules.


     19. For the above reasons, I am satisfied  there  is  no  valid  appeal
         respect to the reference HU/02370/2016, but I am satisfied there is
         a valid appeal under the reference HU/04601/2016.




Notice of Decision
