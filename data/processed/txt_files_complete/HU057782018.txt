Representation:

For the Appellant:  Ms N Weir, of Burness Paull, Solicitors, Glasgow,
instructed through Waterfords, Solicitors, Brentford
For the Respondent:  Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a decision by FtT Judge Farrelly, promulgated
    on 9 August 2018.

 2. The grounds are set out in the application  filed  with  the  UT  on  9
    October 2018.

 3. In a rule 24 response to the grant of permission, the respondent refers
    to Khan UKUT 00384, which was before the FtT as an unreported decision,
    and has since been reported.

 4. The issue discussed in the FtT's decision at [16 - 19] is  now  settled
    along the lines of Khan, Oji [2018] CSOH 127  and  Dadzie  and  Parker-
    Wilson [2018] CSOH 128.  In short, deceit may justify a  refusal  in  a
    case like this, but a genuine error cannot. That is the approach  which
    the FtT applied.

 5. As a preliminary, Ms Weir referred to  the  grounds  at  paragraph  11.
    References there to  an  interview  and  to  an  interview  record  are
    incorrect, and should be read as references to questions and answers on
    a questionnaire.

 6. Ms Weir centred her arguments on the letter to the appellant  from  his
    previous accountants, dated 4 April 2013 (page 18 of his  FtT  bundle).
    This states that for the period 23 May 2012 to 2  April  2013  his  net
    interim dividends of �36,752 would be "grossed up to  �40,836  in  your
    personal tax return".  She relied also upon the letter from accountants
    he later instructed (page 16),  dated  23  July  2018,  explaining  how
    matters had been rectified with HMRC.  The main points  which  I  noted
    from her submissions, further to the grounds, were these:-

      i) The judge relied unduly on the Home Office  report  to  the  Select
         Committee, which was generic, rather than related to this case.

     ii) The judge paid inadequate attention  to  the  documentary  evidence
         before  him  of  innocent  error,  which  should  have  been  found
         convincing.

    iii) A reasonable person would have taken it from the first accountant's
         letter that a return was being made to HMRC accordingly.  The judge
         failed to consider that issue.

     iv) If the appellant had been inflating his earnings to the respondent,
         there was no reason for the first letter to exist.

      v) There was evidence  that  the  first  accountants  made  errors  in
         returns for the appellant which  led  to  other  assessments  being
         extinguished, to no benefit to the appellant.  That confirmed their
         capacity for error.

     vi) The judge had taken deceit by the appellant as the default position
         on a generalised approach.

    vii) The year at issue  was  the  appellant's  first  year  of  dividend
         income.  That lack of experience made it more likely he  would  not
         realise from the low level of payment that anything had gone wrong.

   viii) While the standard of proof was the  balance  of  probability,  the
         seriousness of the allegation and of the consequences also  had  to
         be considered.

     ix) It was clear that to  ascribe  an  error  to  accountants  was  not
         enough, but the evidence here went beyond passing  the  blame,  and
         formed a coherent explanation.

      x) It was significant  that  HMRC  had  not  seen  fit  to  apply  any
         penalties.

     xi) The decision should be set aside, and on  proper  scrutiny  of  the
         evidence, it should be reversed.

 7. Having considered also the submissions for the  respondent,  I  am  not
    satisfied that the making of the FtT's decision involved the making  of
    any error on a point of law.

 8. As Mr Matthews pointed out, the letter of 4 April 2013 was submitted by
    the appellant with his application to the respondent for leave.   There
    was no other cause for it to be written.  It was well within reason for
    the judge to treat it as part of an exercise of inflating his  earnings
    at the time, rather than as showing him to be  an  innocent  victim  of
    someone else's error.

 9. The tax unpaid, if the appellant was later telling the  truth,  was  on
    �40,000,  whereas  he  paid  only  �152  for  that  period  (page   G2,
    respondent's FtT bundle).  Several reasons  are  to  be  found  in  the
    decision for not accepting this to be an accident:

      At   [12],   the   appellant's   considerable   level   of   financial
      sophistication.

      At [13], an accusation against his previous accountants of negligence,
      but no complaint to their regulatory body; not credible the  appellant
      would leave everything to his [previous]  accountants;  more  credible
      [likely] he would had been called upon by them to approve accounts.

      At [14], accountants would not have carte blanche to make the  return;
      "simple mathematics undermines the claim of ignorance"  -  receipt  of
      over �40,000, yet a modest tax bill; error,  if  such  was  the  case,
      would have been apparent.

10. I am not persuaded that the judge took  a  generic  approach,  or  took
    deceit to be the default assumption.  Rather,  he  gave  reasons  which
    were specific to the case and firmly grounded in the evidence.

11. Ms Weir has focused all the best points for the appellant, but that  is
    reassertion of  his  case,  rather  than  identification  of  error  in
    resolving it.

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
