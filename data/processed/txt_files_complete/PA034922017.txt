               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mrs J Berlow-Rahman, of Berlow Rahman, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, who sought asylum, based on  the
    risk to her daughter of FGM from her husband's family.

 2. The respondent refused the claim for reasons explained  in  her  letter
    dated 27 March 2017.

 3. Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Murray dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal for reasons explained in her decision promulgated  on  8  August
    2017.

 4. The appellant's grounds of appeal are stated  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal dated 24 August 2017 (which in  terms  of  the  TP
    (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23 (1A), now stands as the notice  of  appeal  to
    the UT).

 5. Mrs Berlow-Rahman acknowledged that the grounds are  rather  expansive.
    She said that her core point went to �100  of  the  decision,  and  was
    encapsulated in the grant of permission.

 6. At �100 the judge found "that the social work department and the police
    do not believe that the child's father  will  insist  on  FGM  for  the
    child".

 7. The grant of permission says:

      ... contained in the documentary evidence ... are records  made  at  a
      child protection review case conference held in Glasgow in April 2017.
      Those records show the child  remains  on  the  ...  child  protection
      register  and  that  "there  remains  a  significant  possibility   of
      father... leaving the UK with (the child) to return to  Nigeria,  with
      the intention of subjecting (the child) to FGM". They also show that a
      "storm marker" has been placed on the appellant's family home and that
      ports, airports and  the  Home  Office  have  been  advised  with  the
      "appropriate markers put in place".

      It is arguable that the judge may have erred  in  concluding,  against
      the weight of the evidence, that the social services authority and the
      police do not believe that a risk is  present  and  that  the  overall
      assessment is, as a result, flawed.

 8. Mrs Berlow-Rahman accepted that the case  is  unusual.   The  principal
    alleged likely persecutor in Nigeria (the appellant's  husband)  is  in
    the UK, was a principal witness on her behalf, and has a  direct  stake
    in the success of the claim, being a dependant upon it.  She  submitted
    that the appellant's husband had been very honest in his evidence  that
    he would not stand in the way in Nigeria of what he  considered  to  be
    normal and acceptable cultural practice.

 9. The appellant sought a remit to the FtT.

10. Mrs O'Brien said that the judge had given reasons for not accepting the
    appellant's case, in effect finding it to be a contrivance between  her
    and her husband, and her error might be one of expression  rather  than
    of substance.  Nevertheless, she accepted that the finding at �100,  as
    put, went against the documentary evidence, and the matter was central.

11. Mrs O'Brien did not seek to preserve the  outcome  by  the  alternative
    findings on internal relocation, and conceded that the  outcome  should
    be as sought by the appellant.

12. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

13. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

14. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Designated Judge Murray.

15. The FtT did not make an anonymity direction, and  the  matter  was  not
    mentioned in the UT.  However, in view of the nature of the allegations
    in relation to a young child, I have decided to make a direction.

16. Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify her or any member of her  family.   This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
