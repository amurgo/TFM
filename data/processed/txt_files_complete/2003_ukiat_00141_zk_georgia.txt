                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr S Taghavi (counsel instructed by Powell & Co) for the claimant
Mr G Phillips for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a decision of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  RA  Pullan),
   sitting at Taylor House on 1 May, dismissing an asylum and human  rights
   appeal by a citizen of Georgia, now 33. Leave was  given  on  the  basis
   that a previous refusal had been quashed by consent, following the grant
   of leave for judicial review.

2. The claimant said he had got into trouble at home as a pacifist, being a
   member of the Dukhobor sect (more familiar in the Ukraine,  whence  many
   emigrated to Canada to avoid military service under the Tsars). This had
   led to his being forcibly rounded up by the military police  in  January
   1993 to serve in the war with Abkhazia. When he told them he  could  not
   stand the sight of blood, one of them slashed him across the face with a
   knife. He was put in a cell for a week, and threatened with being hanged
   for treason, or being shot in the knee, if he refused  to  serve.  After
   that he did agree to drive  an  ammunition  lorry.  There  were  further
   arrests for short periods on 26 May (Georgian Independence Day) in 1995,
   1999 and 2001. Then the claimant came to this country, as a visitor with
   a visa, in August 2001.


3. It was while the claimant was here, on either 4  or  8  September  2001,
   that he said he had a phone call from his mother, telling him a military
   policeman had left a call-up notice at their house. The reason was  said
   to be renewed fighting over Abkhazia. What was said to  be  the  call-up
   letter was before the adjudicator; but  there  has  been  no  background
   evidence about any renewed hostilities, either before him or  us.  There
   was also a report by a "country expert", Professor George Hewitt FBA  of
   the London School of Oriental and African Studies.

4. The adjudicator accepted that the claimant is a pacifist  Dukhobor,  who
   had had the experiences he claimed in 1993; but he went on to deal  with
   the evidence about the recent call-up as follows:

  16. However I have grave doubts about the authenticity  of  the  call  up
      request, most obviously because it gives no date for  him  to  report
      for service, only the time of day. I have not seen the original as it
      is with the Home Office, but I find it  very  unlikely  that  such  a
      document would be issued in that form. I also note Professor Hewitt's
      observation on it: though he says it is "seemingly genuine as far  as
      I can tell", he finds "fascinating to learn that call up papers  were
      (?) unexpectedly being distributed to bolster  the  strength  of  the
      Georgian armed forces". Although he is an expert on the region he was
      not aware that reservists were being called up. My conclusions  below
      do not require a finding on this point.

5. That refers to the view the adjudicator took at � 22, as to  what  would
   happen if the claimant were in fact called up on return:

      If the appellant was  in  fact  sent  to  prison  there  is  indeed  a
      likelihood of serious ill-treatment. However, on the  evidence  before
      me I do not consider it reasonably likely that if put to the test, the
      appellant would actually refuse military service, any more than he did
      before.

      The trouble with that  is  that  the  claimant  had  refused  military
   service before, only taking a non-combatant r�le under pressure of  ill-
   treatment: whether what he had  already  suffered  reached  the  minimum
   level of severity for  article  3  may  be  arguable,  but  the  threats
   certainly involved that.  Mr  Phillips  did  not  seek  to  disturb  our
   provisional view (following what had apparently happened on the judicial
   review  application)  that  the  adjudicator's  decision  could  not  be
   supported on this ground.

6. That leaves the point on which  the  adjudicator  made  his  views  very
   clear, but for some reason best known  to  himself  expressly  refrained
   from making a formal finding, at � 16. Once again we have  to  say  that
   adjudicators in general should  reach  conclusions  on  all  the  issues
   before them: even though they may think there is one which  answers  the
   case as a whole, it does  not  always  turn  out  that  way  on  appeal.
   However, the adjudicator's views at � 16 are entirely  sensible  on  the
   evidence before him; if it stood there, we should have had no difficulty
   in coming to our own conclusions on them.

7. The evidence however does not stand there, because with the  application
   for leave to appeal came a supplementary statement by the  claimant,  in
   which he gives an explanation, said to have come in a  phone  call  with
   his mother after he had got the adjudicator's decision, for the  call-up
   notice produced having no reporting date on it. We  shall  say  no  more
   about that now, because someone is going to have to decide whether it is
   to be believed or not.

8. On the question of who had to establish the authenticity or otherwise of
   the call-up notice, Mr Taghavi astonished us by asking us to follow  ABC
   & D (to which he referred, without  citation,  in  his  application  for
   leave to appeal), in preference to Tanveer Ahmed  [2002]  UKIAT  00439*.
   Tanvir Ahmed has been universally followed, so far as we  know,  in  the
   Tribunal since it came out; and there are  decisions  of  the  Court  of
   Appeal which approve not only the system of starred cases  of  which  it
   forms part, but the principle of law it lays down. That  is  to  say,  a
   claimant in an asylum case must show, with what he says is  an  official
   document, as with any other piece of evidence in his case, that it is at
   least reasonably likely to be genuine, and its contents true.

9. Mr Taghavi invited us not to take what seemed to us the  obvious  course
   (given the history of this case) of sending it back to  the  adjudicator
   so he could take a view (preferably on oral evidence) on  the  truth  or
   otherwise of what appears in  the  claimant's  supplementary  statement.
   Instead he invited us to dismiss the appeal ourselves, if  we  were  not
   with him on the Tanvir Ahmed/ABC&D point. He spoke of this as if it were
   a live controversy, on which there was much  anxious  discussion  before
   adjudicators. If there is, we can only say it is his fault  for  raising
   it in the first place, and the adjudicators' for being so  indulgent  as
   to listen to him. The whole point of the starred  decisions  system,  as
   with the doctrine of precedent in general, is to avoid wasting  time  by
   endlessly rearguing points which have already been decided, so it can be
   used on the real issues in the individual case. We declined to  hear  Mr
   Taghavi on this point, and so should  any  adjudicator  before  whom  he
   seeks to make it in future.

10. As there is no live controversy of law, there is in any case no  purpose
   to be served in making our decision in a way which would allow the Court
   of Appeal to pronounce on it before any further  fact-finding  exercise.
   We have to say though that in our view this would have been putting  the
   cart before the horse.  That  should  have  been  plain  enough  to  any
   experienced advocate (which Mr Taghavi most  certainly  is)  for  us  to
   suspect that the real point of his  invitation  was  to  secure  further
   delay for his client, rather than prompt resolution of the issues in the
   case, which is of course our main concern.

11. Since leave was given, following the  judicial  review  proceedings,  to
   argue  the  grounds  of  the  application  of   which   the   claimant's
   supplementary statement formed a part, the truth or otherwise of what he
   says in it will, as we have already said, need  to  be  decided.  No-one
   (and certainly not us, as we should have to come back another  day  with
   an interpreter to hear oral evidence) is in as good a position to decide
   that as the adjudicator, who has heard  this  claimant  at  some  length
   already.

12. Though the adjudicator was, as so often, put in a difficult position  by
   the failure of the  Home  Office  to  field  a  presenting  officer,  he
   considered the credibility issues in the case with obvious care. He made
   a general finding in the claimant's favour, but indicated, with reasons,
   a negative view, on the evidence before him, on the authenticity of  the
   call-up notice. What  conclusions  he  now  comes  to,  on  the  present
   evidence about that (including the presence or absence of any


   background evidence to show a current need  to  call  up  reservists  in
   Georgia) are entirely up to him; but we have no doubt that  he  is  well
   capable of approaching the question with an open mind.
