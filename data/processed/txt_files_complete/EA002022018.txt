Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Eaton of Counsel, instructed by Clyde
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Swinnerton promulgated on 21 September 2018, in which  the  Appellant's
    appeal against the decision  to  refuse  her  application  for  an  EEA
    Residence Card on the basis of permanent residence under Regulation  15
    of the Immigration (European, Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (the "EEA
    Regulations") was dismissed.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria, born on 10 November  1986,  who
    entered the United Kingdom in  August  2010  and  was  granted  an  EEA
    Residence Card on 24 May 2012 as a dependent of her mother, an  Italian
    national, the "Sponsor".  She applied on 30 April 2017 for a  permanent
    residence card on the same basis, which was refused by  the  Respondent
    on 8 December 2017.

 3. The reasons for refusal were that there was  insufficient  evidence  to
    show that the Sponsor had been exercising treaty rights in  the  United
    Kingdom for the required continuous period of five years.  In  relation
    to claimed periods of jobseeking, there was a lack of evidence  of  the
    Sponsor seeking employment and having a genuine chance of being engaged
    and exact time periods of jobseeking had not been  identified,  further
    there was no proof that the unemployment preceding it was  involuntary.
    In relation to claimed self-employment, the Appellant had provided self-
    employment tax calculations for the Sponsor for the years ending  April
    2014,  2015  and  2016,  showing  income  of  �362,  �2832  and   �3120
    respectively.  The self-employment comprised of a few hours a week at a
    car boot sale and was  not  considered  to  be  genuine  and  effective
    employment, rather it was only  supplementary  to  the  state  benefits
    being received.

 4. Judge Swinnerton dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated  on  21
    September 2018 on all grounds.  It was not accepted  that  the  Sponsor
    was self-employed during  the  period  2012  to  2017,  which  was  not
    supported by the HMRC documents and at best the evidence showed only ad
    hoc use of car boot sales.  The Sponsor's claimed period of  incapacity
    to work from July 2016 was also  queried  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    given the claimed self-employment and receipt of carers  allowance  for
    her disabled  son  at  the  time.   It  was  accepted  that  there  was
    sufficient evidence of job seeking however in 2018.

The appeal

 5. The Appellant appeals on three grounds as follows.  First,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal erred in law in applying an income threshold to establish
    employment.  Secondly, the First-tier Tribunal erred in finding that it
    was inconsistent for a person to be self-employed and also  to  be  ill
    and in receipt of carer's allowance at the  same  time.   Thirdly,  the
    First-tier Tribunal failed to recognise  that  the  Appellant's  worker
    status could be retained even if they were temporarily unable  to  work
    due to illness and  there  is  no  specific  time  limit  on  temporary
    incapacity to work in the circumstances.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Hollingworth  on  1  November
    2018 on all grounds.

 7. At the oral hearing, on behalf of the Appellant, Mr Eaton went  through
    the Appellant's claim  to  the  Sponsor's  exercise  of  treaty  rights
    through the relevant period, by reference to the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal and the evidence before it.  There was no dispute  before
    the First-tier Tribunal that the Sponsor was in employment in the early
    years relevant to the consideration in this application, but the First-
    tier Tribunal did not accept that she was self-employed in later years.
     Issue was taken in  particular  with  paragraphs  17  and  18  of  the
    decision, as being lacking in detail; including an unfair finding about
    a car boot sale not being genuine employment given that the Sponsor was
    not asked specific questions about  this  and  reaching  findings  that
    receipt of carers allowance was inconsistent with self-employment which
    were not sustainable.

 8. The Sponsor's evidence was that employment had ended on 15 April  2012,
    following which there was  a  period  of  work  seeking  and  she  then
    commenced self-employment from January 2013.  The First-tier Tribunal's
    finding that there was no evidence of job searching at this time failed
    to attach any weight to the  Sponsor's  own  evidence  in  her  written
    statement and supported  by  emails  submitted  in  the  appeal  bundle
    showing the same.  It was submitted that there was sufficient  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal to show job seeking in this period.

 9. In terms of self-employment, there was evidence before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal of earnings to the year ending April 2014 of �362, earnings of
    �2832 for the year ending April 2015 (this figure was accepted  in  the
    reasons for refusal letter, albeit it was accepted that  there  was  no
    evidence of the same contained in  the  bundle  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal) and of income of �3120 to the year ending  April  2016.   The
    documentary evidence included tax returns, management accounts and bank
    statements.

10. Finally, there is evidence of a period of  ill-health  from  2017  from
    which the Sponsor was temporarily incapable of work.

11. On behalf of the Respondent, Mr Tufan submitted that for the  Appellant
    to succeed, it must be shown that the Sponsor had five continuous years
    exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.  The primary reason for
    refusal was the claimed period of self-employment within  the  relevant
    five years.  The evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  very
    limited, including tax returns only and even  taken  at  their  highest
    showed very low annual earnings which at their highest equated to about
    �60 per week.  For employment to be genuine and effective  rather  than
    merely marginal and ancillary, one  needs  to  look  carefully  at  the
    nature of claimed employment as well as the  earnings.   In  this  case
    there was insufficient evidence that this  was  genuine  and  effective
    employment and therefore no error of law in the findings  with  regards
    to self-employment.

12. In relation to the claimed jobseeking period, there is only  one  email
    available in the evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  which  falls
    far short of establishing that the Sponsor was an active jobseeker  for
    the purposes of Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations.

13. Overall it was submitted that the decision of the First-tier  was  well
    reasoned and rational, with findings which were entirely open to it  on
    the basis of the lack of evidence relied upon by the Appellant.

Findings and reasons

14. The decision of Judge Swinnerton set out the key  documentation  before
    the First-tier Tribunal with regards to  self-employment  in  paragraph
    16, including the tax  return  calculation,  other  tax  documents  and
    benefit notifications.  The key findings in relation to self-employment
    and job seeking were then as follows:

         "17. In relation to herself-employment, the sponsor stated  at  the
         hearing that she had sold goods at car boot sales for  five  years.
         To clarify that she was not a market stall holder who had a licence
         and paid a rent for a stall at an  established  market  but  rather
         that she bought goods which she then sold at car boot sales.   That
         was the nature of her self-employment.  The sponsor was not able to
         provide much by way of details at the hearing as to  how  she  went
         about carrying out the self-employed work of selling items  at  car
         boot sales.  At the same time as  carrying  out  the  self-employed
         work, the sponsor was a carer for  her  son  and  received  carer's
         allowance for doing so which, by her own account, was for a  period
         from 2012 ending in April 2017.

         18.  A letter from HMRC dated 4.10.2016 details  that  the  sponsor
         did not receive income for the tax years ending  April  2014,  2015
         and 2016.  The tax return calculation for the sponsor  for  2013/14
         details income of �362.  Based upon the evidence of the sponsor  at
         the hearing and the available documentation, I do not  accept  that
         the sponsor was engaged in self-employment as  claimed  during  the
         period from 2012 to 2017 because she  had  caring  responsibilities
         throughout that time for her son for which she was receiving carers
         allowance and the level of income earned as reported by  HMRC  does
         not indicate that the sponsor was  engaged  in  self-employment  as
         maintained but rather that she carried out some ad hoc activity  in
         selling items at car boot sales.

         19.  I note also that the sponsor was awarded personal independence
         payment (which is a welfare benefit intended to help with the  cost
         of living with a long-term health condition or disability) for  the
         period from July 2016 until September 2019.  It  appears  therefore
         that the sponsor was, at least from mid-2016, in  receipt  of  both
         carer's allowance in relation to her son and personal  independence
         payment for herself such that any self-employment activities  would
         clearly have been impacted by the sponsor's need to  care  for  her
         son and by her own health condition or disability.

         20.  In relation to the job seeking activities of the sponsor,  the
         documentation provided in the Appellant's bundle appears to  relate
         to efforts made quite recently and largely in 2018.   It  does  not
         appear to relate to the period from late 2012 onwards as it is self-
         employment that the sponsor maintains was  the  way  in  which  she
         exercised Treaty rights for almost all of the relevant period of  5
         years.

         21.   I  am  satisfied,  therefore,  that  the  Appellant  has  not
         addressed the points raised in the refusal letter, that the sponsor
         has not exercised Treaty rights as required by the Regulations  and
         that the Appellant is not entitled to permanent residence."

15. In relation to self-employment, the summary of the evidence before  the
    First-tier Tribunal contained in the decision is a fair summary of  the
    very limited evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  Sponsor's
    evidence in relation to her self- employment was incredibly  brief  and
    lacking in any detail.  There is an incomplete  copy  of  two  sets  of
    management accounts, the first relating to the  period  to  April  2015
    contains  only  the  first  two  pages  and  no  financial  information
    whatsoever and the second relating to the period to April 2016 includes
    a single page setting out turnover and profit but does not include  any
    cost of sales, which does not support the Sponsor's claim that she  was
    buying goods to sell at  car  boot  sales  as  a  business.   The  HMRC
    documents, comprising of the  tax  return  to  April  2014  and  a  tax
    calculation for the year to April 2016, even taking  into  account  the
    intervening tax return referred to in the  decision  letter,  at  their
    highest show very low or low levels of income only.  Although there  is
    no minimum income requirement, employment, or self-employment  must  be
    genuine and effective, rather than merely  ancillary  marginal.   There
    was nothing more in the present appeal to support a  claim  that  self-
    employment was genuine and the factual findings as set out above  based
    on this incredibly limited evidence are unchallengeable on any  factual
    or legal grounds.

16. There is some force in the criticism of the reasoning of the First-tier
    Tribunal that a person would not be able to engage  in  self-employment
    in circumstances in which they were also themselves  suffering  from  a
    health condition or disability, as  well  as  providing  a  significant
    level  of  care  for  a  child.   Those  matters   are   not   mutually
    inconsistent, albeit as a matter of practicality, it is clear that  the
    Sponsor had responsibilities which  would  impact  on  her  ability  to
    engage in any extensive self-employment.   In  any  event  the  primary
    reason for the finding that the Sponsor had not been  self-employed  as
    claimed is not to do with health or caring  responsibilities,  but  the
    lack of evidence of actual self-employment and lack of earnings claimed
    as a result.  There is therefore no material error of  law  overall  in
    the findings in relation to self-employment.

17. In relation to job seeking activities, the First-tier  Tribunal  refers
    to a lack of evidence of job seeking from late 2012 onwards  and  notes
    that the period overlaps with the claimed  period  of  self-employment.
    Having considered the material before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  there
    are three emails in relation to jobseeking  in  November  2012  (albeit
    they all relate to a single application for the same job); four  emails
    in February 2013 relating to job applications and one in each of  March
    and April 2013.  The claimed  period  of  jobseeking  falls  after  the
    Sponsor's employment ended on 15 April 2012,  through  to  the  end  of
    December 2012, following which self-employment was said to  have  begun
    in January 2013.  The evidence amounts to a single  application  for  a
    job in the period claimed and could not on any view  establish  that  a
    person was actively seeking work during that period for the purposes of
    exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.  There is therefore  no
    error of law in the findings reached on this point either by the First-
    tier Tribunal, who came to the only conclusion reasonably open to it on
    the paucity of evidence submitted by the Appellant.

18. The Appellant's final ground of appeal in relation to the lack of  time
    restriction on the period in which a person could be temporarily unable
    to work because of illness, during which they would retain their worker
    status, bears no relevance at all to the outcome of  this  appeal.   It
    fails to recognise that the Sponsor did not have the status of a worker
    immediately preceding her period of temporary incapacity for  work  and
    there was therefore no status which could be retained for any period of
    time.  There can be no error of law on this basis and  the  appeal  was
    bound to fail for the reasons already given.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to dismiss the appeal is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
