For the Respondent:    Ms K Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellants appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-
         tier Tribunal Coutts (the judge),  promulgated  on  19  June  2019,
         dismissing their joint appeals against  the  respondent's  decision
         dated 31 May 2018 refusing their human rights claims.



Background

      2. The appellants are both nationals of Nepal. The 1st  appellant  was
         born on 5 July 1989 and the 2nd appellant was  born  on  11  August
         1983. They both entered  the  UK  on  31  December  2009,  the  1st
         appellant as a student, the 2nd appellant as  her  dependent.  They
         were granted further periods of leave, the last being  valid  until
         30 March 2016. They have two dependent children, both of whom  were
         born in the UK. The eldest child was 5ï¿½ years old at  the  date  of
         the First-tier Tribunal hearing and the other child  was  3  months
         old. On 16 March 2018 the appellants applied for leave to remain on
         human rights grounds. The applications were refused  on  the  basis
         that  the  appellants  did  not  meet  the  requirements   of   the
         immigration rules  (either  in  respect  of  their  private  lives,
         applying paragraph 276ADE, or in respect  of  their  family  lives,
         applying  Appendix  FM)  and  that  there   were   no   exceptional
         circumstances outside the immigration rules such that a refusal  to
         grant leave would  breach  Article  8  ECHR.  The  appellants  each
         appealed  the  respondent's  decision  pursuant  to  s.82  of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      3. The judge considered a bundle of  documents  running  to  74  pages
         produced  by  the  appellants  and  which  included,  inter   alia,
         statements from  both  appellants,  municipal  letters  from  Nepal
         relating to the damage to their respective family homes  caused  by
         the 2015 earthquake, evidence of the  1st  appellant's  educational
         qualifications and  evidence  confirming  their  oldest  daughter's
         attendance at primary school. The judge heard  oral  evidence  from
         the appellants and set out the basis of their appeal (they were now
         integrated in the UK culture and had developed friendships, that if
         they were allowed to stay they  would  be  able  to  develop  their
         skills and not be a burden on society, and that the 2015 earthquake
         left both families  homes  damaged  and  uninhabitable  with  their
         respective families living in temporary accommodation made from mud
         and stone that was vulnerable and susceptible  to  adverse  weather
         conditions and not even adequate for the family  members  who  were
         living in them).  The  judge  referred  to  a  number  of  relevant
         authorities and accurately set  out  the  burden  and  standard  of
         proof.

      4. At [31] the judge found the appellants to be credible witnesses. At
         [34] - [36] the judge found that there were  no  'very  significant
         obstacles' to the appellants' return to Nepal and gave reasons  for
         his conclusion. One of the reasons, contained  at  [35],  was  that
         both appellants had family remaining in Nepal who could assist them
         with their relocation and provide support. From  [37]  onwards  the
         judge considered the  Article  8  appeal  outside  the  immigration
         rules. At [38] the judge identified the relevant private and family
         life relationships in play, and at 39 he indicated that  the  issue
         for his consideration was  that  of  proportionality.  At  [40]  he
         indicated that his starting point was the  best  interests  of  the
         children, which was a primary consideration.

      5. At [41] the judge stated,

             "The appellant's [sic] eldest daughter is  5  and  half  years
             old. I was told that she enjoys school and has made  a  number
             of friends. I was also told that she would be upset  and  find
             it emotionally difficult if she had to  leave  United  Kingdom
             [sic] and relocate to Nepal as she has  known  no  other  life
             than here."

      6. At [42] the judge stated,

             "Any disruption with the appellants' eldest  daughter's  life,
             such as relocating to Nepal, is bound to be difficult for  her
             at a young age."

      7. At [43] the judge stated,

             "However, she would be relocating there with her  parents  and
             younger sister and has family there that she regularly  speaks
             to you [sic] on the telephone  in  Nepalese.  There  are  also
             schools in Nepal that she would be  able  to  attend,  as  her
             parents did, and there is no reason why any disruption  caused
             by relocating to Nepal cannot be managed by her  parents  with
             emotional support as they are currently doing."

      8.  The  judge  then  took  account  of  other  factors  such  as  the
         appellants'  private  lives  having  been  established  when  their
         immigration status  was  precarious  (which  would  attract  little
         weight under statutory provisions), but noting that they had always
         resided lawfully, were not involved in any wrongdoing,  spoke  good
         English and  were,  in  principle,  capable  of  being  financially
         independent.

      9. At [48] the judge concluded,

             "However, I am not satisfied that these factors are enough  to
             outweigh the  public  interest  in  maintaining  an  effective
             immigration control. The appellants can continue their private
             life in Nepal and can  keep  in  touch  with  any  friends  or
             connections made here at a distance. The same applies to their
             eldest daughter with the friends she has also made here."

     10.  The  appeal  was  dismissed  on  the  basis  that  there  was   no
         disproportionate interference with Article 8.

The challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's decision

     11. The written grounds are discursive. The first ground contends  that
         the judge failed to discharge his duty under s.55 of  the  Borders,
         Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009.  There  was  said  to  be
         insufficient consideration of the oldest  daughter's  physical  and
         mental health, emotional, social and behavioural  development,  and
         no  consideration  of  the  family's  lost  home  or  the  risk  of
         'potential woman and child trafficking'. I pause at this  stage  to
         note that there was no medical  evidence  relating  to  the  eldest
         daughter's physical and  mental  health,  no  independent  evidence
         relating  to  her  social  and  behavioural  development,  and   no
         independent evidence relating to any  risk  of  trafficking  placed
         before the judge. The first  ground  reiterated  the  loss  of  the
         family home and that the various  family  members  were  living  in
         temporary accommodation build of stone and mud that was  vulnerable
         in nature and susceptible to adverse weather conditions.

     12. The 2nd ground contended that the judge only considered the  appeal
         under the immigration rules "... but  failed  to  apply  discretion
         vested in him." I pause again to note that the  judge  demonstrably
         considered the appeal outside of the immigration rules (see [37] et
         seq).

     13. In granting permission to appeal Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P
         J M Hollingworth found it arguable that the s.55 factors  were  not
         adequately considered by the judge and that his balancing  exercise
         contained an insufficient analysis of relevant factors.

     14. In his skeleton argument produced for the  error  of  law  hearing,
         which was written with greater clarity than either the  grounds  of
         appeal or the grant of permission to appeal, Mr  West  argued  that
         the judge failed to properly address issues relevant to  the  'best
         interests' assessment as set out in EV  (Philippines)  [2014]  EWCA
         Civ 874 and that he failed to properly consider the consequences of
         the credible  evidence  that  the  appellants'  family  homes  were
         destroyed  by  the  earthquake.  The  circumstances  in  which  the
         children would find themselves was relevant to  the  assessment  of
         their  best  interests  which  was,  in  turn,  relevant   to   the
         proportionality assessment under Article 8 when determining whether
         there were exceptional or compelling  circumstances.  In  his  oral
         submissions Mr West contended that it was not open to the judge  to
         find that the appellants family members could provide  support  and
         assistance in light of their accepted evidence to the contrary.

     15. In her submissions Ms Everett invited me to find that  the  judge's
         positive credibility findings did not mean that he had to  approach
         the appellants' fears on the basis that they would be realised  and
         that most of the points upon which Mr West relied were  an  attempt
         to re-argue the appeal.

     16. I reserved my decision.

Discussion

     17. There is no merit with the second ground of  appeal.  It  is  clear
         from [37] onwards that the judge did consider the appeal outside of
         the immigration rules. At [37] the judge reminded  himself  of  the
         principles established in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and  applied  those
         principles finding that Article 8 was engaged  in  respect  of  the
         private lives established by the appellants and that the  issue  he
         had to determine was one of proportionality [39]. The judge weighed
         up a number of relevant factors including the best interests of the
         children  and  the  public  interest  factors  in  s117B   of   the
         Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (including   the
         precarious nature of the appellants' residence,  their  proficiency
         in English and their ability to be  financially  independent),  and
         concluded that these  were  insufficient  to  outweigh  the  public
         interest [48]. The judge's approach cannot be impugned.

     18. I now consider whether the judge erred in law in  his  approach  to
         the best interests of the appellants' children. The judge expressly
         referred to his s.55 duty [27] and the authority of  ZH  (Tanzania)
         [2011] UKSC 4 [26]. The judge properly noted that the best interest
         of the children was 'a primary consideration' [40]. When  assessing
         the best interests of the  children,  and  in  particular,  the  5ï¿½
         daughter, the judge took account of relevant factors including  her
         age, that she enjoyed school and had made  friends,  and  that  she
         would be emotionally upset if told that she has  to  leave  the  UK
         [41]. As the judge stated at [42], "Any disruption" to  the  eldest
         daughter "such as relocating to Nepal, is bound to be difficult for
         her at a young age." At [43] the  judge  properly  noted  that  the
         family would be removed as  a  single  unit  and  that  the  oldest
         daughter had  extended  family  in  Nepal  with  whom  she  was  in
         communication. The judge noted that there were schools in Nepal,  a
         point not refuted by the appellants. The judge also found that  any
         disruption caused by relocation could be managed by the appellants.



     19. There  is  no  basis  for  contending  that  the  judge  failed  to
         adequately take into account the factors identified at paragraph 35
         of EV (Philippines). The judge was unarguably aware of the  age  of
         the oldest child [17] and he must be taken to have been aware  that
         she had resided in the UK all her life. The judge  was  aware  that
         the eldest child was at school [18] and he  must  have  been  aware
         that she had started primary education. The judge recorded evidence
         that the  oldest  child  was  in  regular  communication  with  her
         grandparents on the telephone and that she understood some but  not
         all of the Nepalese that was spoken to her [17] & [43].  The  judge
         found that any disruption to the  oldest  daughter  caused  by  the
         relocation could be managed  with  the  emotional  support  of  her
         parents [43]. There was little other evidence  of  the  nature  and
         extent of the oldest daughter's private life. I am  satisfied  that
         the judge did take account of the factors relevant to an assessment
         of the oldest daughter's best interests.

     20. At the heart of the appellant's appeal is the contention  that  the
         judge failed to consider the conditions in  which  the  appellants'
         children may find themselves given  that  their  accommodation  was
         destroyed in the 2015 earthquake, and that this was  relevant  when
         assessing their best interests and consequently whether there  were
         compelling circumstances outside the immigration  rules  such  that
         the refusal to grant the appellants leave to remain would result in
         unjustifiably harsh consequences for them and their children.

     21. I accept that the judge did not explicitly  address  the  issue  of
         accommodation for the family on return to  Nepal,  although  it  is
         something that he had in mind - see [13]. The evidence relating  to
         the nature of any temporary accommodation that may be available  to
         the appellants was however limited.  There  was  a  letter  from  a
         Nepalese municipality indicating that the  1st  appellant's  family
         home was "fully devastated" by the earthquake and that  her  family
         were treated as earthquake  victims,  and  a  letter  from  another
         municipality indicating that the 2nd appellant's  family  home  was
         "partially  destroyed".  The  letters  made  no  reference  to  the
         temporary accommodation in which  the  appellants'  various  family
         members lived. The appellants provided no independent  evidence  or
         background evidence that any temporary accommodation in respect  of
         which they may be required to live on their return to  Nepal  would
         be unsuitable for their two daughters, or that  such  accommodation
         would significantly  impact  on  the  safety  and  welfare  of  the
         children. The description of the temporary  accommodation  occupied
         by the appellants' grandparents  and  siblings  was  very  general.
         Their accommodation was made from stone and mud and was susceptible
         to adverse weather conditions. There were  no  photographs  of  the
         accommodation occupied by the appellants' families. The  appellants
         failed to produce any independent  evidence  as  to  the  amenities
         available, including the availability of electricity and water. The
         burden of proof rested on the appellants and it  was  incumbent  on
         them to  produce  sufficiently  detailed  evidence  of  the  likely
         conditions that awaited them if  they  were  forced  to  reside  in
         temporary accommodation.

     22. The judge found, in  any  event,  that  there  was  no  reason  the
         appellants would be unable to find employment to support themselves
         and their children [36]. The judge acknowledged the  evidence  that
         the 1st appellant undertook a hotel training course in  Nepal,  and
         that she obtained a master's degree in marketing in the UK together
         with qualifications including a postgraduate  diploma  in  business
         and marketing strategy and a diploma in tourism ([9] &  [12]).  The
         judge also acknowledged that the 2nd appellant had  worked  in  the
         hotel industry in both Nepal and the UK as a safety engineer ([9] &
         [12]).   Even  if  the  appellants  had  to  resort  to   temporary
         accommodation, the judge's findings indicated that  they  would  be
         capable of finding employment and that they would therefore be able
         to move into more permanent accommodation.

     23. The judge's reference at [35] to  the  appellants'  families  being
         able to provide them with  assistance  with  their  relocation  and
         support is vaguely phrased. It would have been  preferable  if  the
         judge had clearly stated what type of  assistance  and  support  he
         anticipated could be provided given the appellants'  evidence  that
         their respective  families  were  themselves  living  in  temporary
         accommodation and would be unable  to  provide  financial  support.
         There was however no  evidence  suggesting  that  both  appellants'
         families could not provide other practical  and  emotional  support
         support and there was no evidence that the  2nd  appellant's  elder
         brother, who had retired from the Indian army  and  was  living  in
         Nepal,  was  incapable  of  providing  temporary  accommodation  or
         financial support. I once again note that it was for the appellants
         to  provide  evidential  support  for  their  contention  that  the
         conditions on return to Nepal would be such as to make  it  in  the
         children's best interests to remain in the UK, and  to  render  the
         removal of the family a disproportionate interference with  Article
         8. The appellants failed to provide a sufficient  evidential  basis
         and, on the basis of the limited  evidence  adduced  by  them,  the
         judge would not have been entitled to find that the removal of  the
         family  unit  was  capable  of  constituting   a   disproportionate
         interference with Article 8.

     24. For the reasons given above I am not satisfied that the  judge  has
         erred on a point of law such as to require his decision to  be  set
         aside.
