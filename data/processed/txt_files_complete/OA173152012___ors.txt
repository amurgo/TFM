    DECISION ON WHETHER TO ADMIT AN APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL

1. This case came before me following a grant of  permission  on  19  August
   2013 to the Entry Clearance Officer, to appeal the decision of the First-
   tier Tribunal allowing the appeals against the decision to  refuse  entry
   clearance to the United Kingdom.

2. The respondents (hereafter referred to as the claimants) are citizens  of
   China,  born  on  24  July  1973,  15  August  1994  and  23  April  1996
   respectively. They applied for entry clearance to settle  in  the  United
   Kingdom as the spouse, step-daughter and son of the sponsor,  Chen  Tang,
   who had  been  granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  under  the  legacy
   programme. Their applications were refused on 22 August 2012  and  on  29
   May 2013 their appeals were heard in the First-tier Tribunal and  allowed
   under the immigration rules.

3. The grounds of appeal, in  providing  reasons  for  the  application  for
   permission being late, refer to the Secretary of  State  having  received
   the Tribunal's determination on 14  June  2013.  On  7  August  2013  the
   Specialist Appeals Team, on behalf of the Entry Clearance  Officer,  made
   an application to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal to the
   Upper Tribunal. A request was made for time to be extended, on the  basis
   that the application ought to have been  lodged  by  19  June  2013.  The
   request erroneously referred to rule 21 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
   Tribunal) Rules 2008, whereas the correct rule was rule 24 of the  Asylum
   & Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

4. On 19 August 2013 First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers  granted  permission
   to appeal, without giving any consideration to the timelessness issue and
   without specifically extending time for appealing.

5. The appeals then came before me on 1 November 2013. Mr Tufan raised as  a
   preliminary issue, the matter of the out-of-time  application.  No  issue
   had ever been raised by the claimants' representatives in that regard and
   Mr Tufan raised it himself as a  matter  of  fairness.  He  produced  the
   decisions of the Upper Tribunal in the cases of Wang and Chin  (extension
   of time for appealing) [2013] UKUT  343  and  Samir  (FtT  Permission  to
   appeal: time) [2013] UKUT 3 in  that  regard  and,  by  way  of  a  brief
   submission, relied on the explanation for the delay provided  as  in  the
   application. Ms Tung accepted that it had never been alleged on behalf of
   the claimants that the ECO's application was out of time, but now that it
   had been raised she would be relying on the matter. I  went  on  to  hear
   from both parties on the error  of  law  issue  in  order  that  I  could
   consider both matters at a later stage, but on the basis of  my  findings
   below on the timeliness of the applications, that was, on reflection, not
   necessary.

6. With regard to the time limit  for  seeking  permission  to  appeal,  The
   Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005  (SI  230/2005)
   state as follows:

         "24. (1) A party seeking permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
         must make a written application to the  [First-tier]  Tribunal  for
         permission to appeal.


             (2) Subject to paragraph (3) [which  does  not  apply  in  this
               case], an application under paragraph (1) must  be  sent  or
               delivered to the Tribunal so that it is  received  no  later
               than 5 days after the date on which  the  party  making  the
               application is deemed  to  have  been  served  with  written
               reasons for the decision.
        ...
             (4) If a person makes an application under paragraph (1)  later
               than the time required by paragraph (2) -
               (a) the Tribunal  may  extend  the  time  for  appealing  if
                  satisfied that by  reason  of  special  circumstances  it
                  would be unjust not to do so; and
               (b) unless the Tribunal  extends  time  under  sub-paragraph
                  (a), the Tribunal must not admit the application.


             (5) An application under paragraph (1) must -
               (a) identify the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  to  which  it
               relates;
               (b) identify the alleged error  or  errors  of  law  in  the
               decision; and
               (c) state the result the party  making  the  application  is
               seeking. "

7.  Rule  25  requires  a  decision  to  be  made  on  an  application,  and
   communicated to the parties in writing.

8. Both parties accepted that the application was  made  out  of  time.  The
   reasons provided in the application admit to  the  delay  as  being  some
   seven weeks and refer to  the  recipient  of  the  determination  as  the
   Secretary of State. It could, perhaps, have been  argued  that  different
   time limits applied, both as to receipt of the determination and the time
   limit for appealing, given that the respondent in the First-tier Tribunal
   was the Entry Clearance Office who was based in China,  contrary  to  the
   circumstances  identified  in  Samir  where  the  applicant  was  clearly
   identified as the Secretary of State. However the case  was  not  put  on
   that basis and the grounds of appeal did not suggest that the time limits
   for out-of-country applications applied. Indeed the grounds refer to  the
   determination having been sent to the  Secretary  of  State  and  to  the
   lodging of the application being the task of the Secretary of  State,  so
   suggesting an application made inside the  UK.  In  any  event  Mr  Tufan
   accepted that even if the 28 day time-limit were considered  for  out-of-
   country applications, the application would still have been made  out  of
   time.  I therefore proceed on the basis that the application was made out
   of time.

9. Accordingly, pursuant to rule 24(4),  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  not
   permitted to admit the application unless and until a decision  had  been
   made to extend time. In the absence of such a decision, it was  found  in
   the cases of Boktor and Wanis (late  application  for  permission)  Egypt
   [2011]  UKUT  00442,  Samir  and  Mohammed  (late  application-First-tier
   Tribunal) Somalia [2013] UKUT 467, that the substance of the appeal could
   not be entertained and  consideration  had  first  to  be  given  to  the
   question of whether "by reason  of  special  circumstances  it  would  be
   unjust not to do so" [ie extend time].

10. In the case of Mohammed the Upper Tribunal, in circumstances similar  to
   those in which I find myself, decided to  reconstitute  themselves  as  a
   panel of the First-tier Tribunal  in  order  to  resolve  the  timeliness
   issue. Accordingly, I do the same.

11. The explanation given  for  the  delay,  as  stated  in  the  permission
   application, was as follow:

    "Due to a backlog of determinations received in the Specialist  Appeals
    Team in June  there  were  insufficient  resources  available  to  give
    adequate scrutiny to  every  determination  and  due  to  an  oversight
    permission to appeal  was  not  sought  in  this  decision.  The  Entry
    Clearance Manager in Guanghzhou  has  since  contacted  the  Specialist
    Appeals Team in order to request that we consider making an out of time
    application.

    It is respectfully submitted that the grounds are arguable and that  it
    would be improper for the Entry Clearance Officer not to  present  them
    simply because of an administrative error. While such errors are to  be
    avoided,  large  bureaucracies  will  inevitably   have   some   errors
    committed; in such cases it is hoped that any errors occur on points of
    little significance. Unfortunately this was not the case here.  Failing
    to grant permission in this case  would,  it  is  submitted,  impose  a
    disproportionate unfairness on the Entry Clearance Officer."

12. Proceeding on the basis of the  period  of  the  delay  admitted  to  on
   behalf of the Entry Clearance, namely some seven weeks, it  seems  to  me
   that such a substantial delay cannot be justified in terms of  inadequate
   resources or administrative oversight. The grounds provide no explanation
   as to when the Entry Clearance Manager received the decision, how quickly
   (s)he considered the determination and contacted the  Specialist  Appeals
   Team and how long it then took the Specialist Appeals Team to  lodge  the
   application. It is  not  clear  whether  the  delay  was  only  with  the
   Specialist Appeals Team or whether there was also a delay on the part  of
   the Entry Clearance Manager and, in the latter case, what the explanation
   was for that delay. Neither do the reasons offer any indication of  whose
   initiative and responsibility it was to consider appealing a decision  of
   the First-tier  Tribunal  and  why  the  ECM  could  not  have  made  the
   application him/herself.

13. Aside from the period of the delay, the explanation for  the  delay  and
   the question of whether the explanation covered the entire period of  the
   delay, I have also considered other relevant factors as  referred  to  in
   the case of Boktor and Wanis, with reference to the principles in BO  and
   Others (Extension of time for appealing) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 00035. Such
   other relevant factors include the prejudice to the respondent, a  matter
   raised on behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  the  permission
   application, in the reasons  given  for  the  delay.  However  I  do  not
   consider that there arises any significant prejudice to the ECO so as  to
   justify such a substantial delay.

14. The claimants' applications  were  refused  on  the  basis  of  multiple
   concerns, with respect to discrepancies arising as to the identity of the
   sponsor and the date and thus  validity  of  the  marriage,  as  well  as
   accommodation and maintenance. By the time  of  the  hearing  before  the
   First-tier Tribunal, however, the relationship between  the  parties  had
   been accepted and the grounds of appeal made no challenge to the  judge's
   finding that the  marriage  was  genuine  and  subsisting.  Any  mismatch
   between the dates given for the marriage in  the  Gregorian  and  Chinese
   Lunar calendars, as raised in the grounds,  was,  in  the  light  of  the
   various other positive and  unchallenged  findings  about  the  marriage,
   plainly not a material  matter.  The  grounds  relating  to  the  judge's
   findings on accommodation was only a partial challenge and did not, in my
   view, have particular merit: the judge was entitled to make the  findings
   that she did. The only real challenge to the  decision  was  the  judge's
   findings on maintenance and that was the only ground upon which Mr  Tufan
   had submissions to make.  In  that  respect,  the  sponsor  had  produced
   evidence of monthly salary payments of �300, above the  equivalent  level
   of income support, and even if the net amount  of  �250  was  considered,
   there was evidence of savings held by the sponsor which were adequate  to
   make up the shortfall in income of what appeared to be no more than �9  a
   week.

15. Accordingly I find that this is not a case in which  it  could  be  said
   that the grounds of appeal have a high prospect of success, or  that  the
   claimants would not have succeeded again had the decision in the  appeals
   had to be re-made, nor that any  substantial  injustice  is  suffered  by
   allowing Judge Taylor's  determination  to  stand.  I  am  therefore  not
   satisfied that there are special  circumstances  according  to  which  it
   would be unjust not to extend time and I am not satisfied that it  is  in
   the interests of justice that time for  the  application  for  permission
   should now be extended. I therefore decline to admit the Entry  Clearance
   Officer's application. It follows that,  the  appeals  of  the  claimants
   having been allowed by the First-tier  Tribunal,  that  decision  stands.
   There is no appeal pending before the Upper Tribunal.
