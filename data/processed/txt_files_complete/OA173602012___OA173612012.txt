Representation:

For the Appellant: Mrs C Dewison, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Ms C Soltani, Iris Law

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1) This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a decision by
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shanahan allowing these appeals under
      Article  8.   The  Respondents  (herein  after  referred  to  as  "the
      Claimants") are children, born on 14 May 1998 and  4  June  1996,  who
      applied for entry clearance to join their mother, Mrs  Muna  Nuruahmed
      Abdu, in the UK.

Error of law

   2) Following the decision by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Shanahan
      the ECO was granted permission to  appeal  and  there  was  a  hearing
      before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup on 7  October  2013  on  the
      question of whether there was an error of law in the decision by Judge
      of the First-tier Tribunal Shanahan and whether that  decision  should
      be set aside.  Judge Pickup found an error of  law  in  the  following
      terms:

           "16.  I find that the relevant issue was whether the mother  and
           the [Claimants] could either continue or further  develop  their
           family life outside the UK,  either  in  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,  or
           elsewhere.  Further, if it was legally  or  physically  possible
           for them to do so, whether it would be reasonable to expect  her
           to leave the UK in order to do so.  The answer to that  question
           must  have  a  material  bearing   on   the   outcome   of   the
           proportionality balancing  exercise.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge reached conclusions on this issue that had  no  foundation
           in any express findings of fact or on the basis on any  evidence
           before her.  I find that she made the  assumption  that  it  was
           impossible for family life to  take  place  outside  of  the  UK
           without evidential or factual support.   In  the  circumstances,
           that must be an error of  law  which  could  have  affected  the
           outcome of the appeal, such that the Determination ought  to  be
           set aside."

   3) Judge Pickup was unable to proceed to remake the decision on  the  day
      of  the  hearing.   The  decision  on  the  error  of  law  issue  was
      promulgated on 29 October 2013.  The  appeals  were  adjourned  for  a
      resumed hearing at a later date.  In order to avoid  undue  delay  the
      appeal was transferred from Judge Pickup to me.

Factual background

   4) The background is set out  in  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal.  The relationship between the Claimants and their mother was
      established by DNA evidence.  It  was  accepted  that  the  Claimants'
      father was deceased.  The issues before the First-tier  Tribunal  were
      whether the mother had  sole  responsibility  for  the  Claimants  and
      whether there was adequate maintenance for them.

   5) The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that at  the  time  of
      the application for entry clearance the Claimants were looked after in
      Ethiopia by a friend of their mother, Saedia Mehammed.  The Claimants'
      father was killed around 2001 but the Claimants' mother was  not  able
      to establish contact with them until around 2006 when she came to  the
      UK.  She had previously lost contact with the children after  she  was
      deported from Ethiopia to Eritrea in  1999.   She  had  been  born  in
      Ethiopia but was of Eritrean descent while her husband, the Claimants'
      father, was Ethiopian.

   6) The Claimants' mother is unemployed and suffers from ill health.   She
      would not be able to provide adequate  maintenance  for  the  children
      herself but she has three friends  who  are  willing  to  assist  her.
      Before the First-tier Tribunal it was accepted by the  Claimants  that
      their mother required an additional �458.94  per  month  in  order  to
      support them adequately.  Each of the three friends who had offered to
      help were willing to give �300 per month.  The Judge of the First-tier
      Tribunal observed, however, that  none  of  those  offering  financial
      support attended the hearing.  Two of those concerned,  both  doctors,
      explained that they were unable to attend because of work commitments.
       They provided some evidence of their financial standing but there was
      no evidence relating to their commitments  and  outgoings  and  as  to
      their  understanding  of  the  responsibility  that  they   would   be
      undertaking, including the length of time for which this might need to
      continue.  The judge was aware that a case which depended for  success
      upon a third party's voluntary payment would need  to  be  scrutinised
      with particular care.  Accordingly the judge was not  satisfied  there
      was adequate maintenance for the Claimants without recourse to  public
      funds.

   7) Having  decided  that  the  Claimants  could  not  succeed  under  the
      Immigration Rules the judge then considered the appeal under Article 8
      and allowed it.  This decision has been set aside, however,  by  Judge
      Pickup for the reasons set out above.

Resumed hearing before the Upper Tribunal

   8) Prior to the hearing before me new evidence was lodged  on  behalf  of
      the Claimants, in particular, an expert report by Dr John R  Campbell.
      I allowed this new evidence to be admitted without  objection.   There
      was  also  an  up-to-date  witness  statement  by  the  Sponsor,   the
      Claimants' mother, and a copy of her British  passport  containing  an
      Ethiopian visit visa.  The Sponsor appeared before me to give evidence
      and adopted her witness statement before being  cross-examined  by  Mr
      Dewison.

   9) The Sponsor was asked if she had acquired  Ethiopian  citizen  on  the
      basis of her marriage.  The Sponsor explained that at the time she was
      married Ethiopia and Eritrea were one country and she did not have  to
      apply.  It was not until she was deported  in  1999  that  her  ethnic
      background became an issue.

  10) The Sponsor was asked if she had discussed with her husband  obtaining
      Ethiopian nationality.  The Sponsor replied that her  husband  was  of
      Ethiopian origin so the children could stay but she had to leave.  The
      authorities decided the children could stay  with  their  father.   Mr
      Dewison then asked the Sponsor if she  had  ever  discussed  obtaining
      Ethiopian nationality with  her  husband  before  1999.   The  Sponsor
      replied that there was not a problem before  1999  and  they  did  not
      speak of it.  The Sponsor then described how she and her two  brothers
      had taken part in an Eritrean referendum and because of  this  it  was
      decided that they had to leave the country.

  11) Mr Dewison referred to a  guardianship  document  in  respect  of  the
      Claimants  which  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.    In   this
      guardianship document it was said that the Claimants' father had  gone
      to Sudan and Saedia was described as their aunt, although she was  not
      a relative.  The Sponsor confirmed that  her  husband  was  killed  in
      fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea.  She was asked if she had  gone
      to court to arrange the guardianships.  She explained that she did not
      have the right to go to court as she was Eritrean.  She had  left  the
      children with her friend.  It was then put to  her  that  her  friend,
      Saedia, had made false claims in order to be appointed guardian.   The
      Sponsor explained that  Saedia  had  to  say  that  she  was  an  aunt
      otherwise the children would have been taken away  for  adoption.   It
      was now difficult for Saedia to continue looking  after  the  children
      because the boy was getting older and there were  young  daughters  in
      the house.  Saedia was not comfortable with having an older boy in the
      house with her daughters.   The  Sponsor  was  asked  if  she  was  in
      Ethiopia when the guardianship order was made.  She  replied  that  if
      she had been  there  she  would  have  taken  responsibility  for  the
      children.

  12) The Sponsor confirmed that she had  returned  to  Ethiopia  using  her
      British passport and she  had  obtained  a  visa  at  the  airport  in
      Ethiopia.  The Sponsor was asked why she did not obtain  a  visa  from
      the Ethiopian Embassy in the UK.  She explained that she had told  the
      Claimants that they had won their appeal and then it  was  overturned.
      They were very upset.  She had no time to obtain a visa  before  going
      to see them.  She confirmed that the visa  allowed  her  to  stay  for
      three months.  She stayed only for two weeks because  she  had  to  be
      back for a hearing on 7 October 2013.  It is clear that this  was  the
      previous hearing before the Upper Tribunal.

  13) The Sponsor was asked if she had enquired in Ethiopia  about  residing
      there permanently.  She said that she did not ask because it  was  not
      her country anymore.  When she arrived in Ethiopia she was taken  ill.
      She was taken to hospital by ambulance.  At the hospital she mentioned
      she was Eritrean so she was not  treated  like  other  patients.   The
      Sponsor was asked why she did not say she was British.  She  said  she
      did say she was British but because she spoke Tigrinyan she was  asked
      her origin and she had to say she was from Eritrea.

  14) The Sponsor was asked about the children's maintenance.  She explained
      that their father had left some money in the bank and she  sent  money
      herself.  She sent this to people travelling to Ethiopia or by Western
      Union.

  15) The Sponsor was asked what language the children spoke  and  she  said
      that they spoke Amharic because they had always lived in Gonder.   She
      confirmed that she also spoke Amharic.

  16) In re-examination the Sponsor explained that before the children lived
      with Saedia they lived with their father's  sister  but  they  stopped
      living with her three or four years ago  when  she  moved  to  London.
      From that time on they lived with Saedia.

Submissions

  17) In his submissions for the ECO Mr Dewison stated the issue was whether
      the Sponsor could return to live with the children in Ethiopia, either
      legally or reasonably.  He referred to paragraph 24 of Judge  Pickup's
      decision, in which the judge stated that no finding of fact  had  been
      made in respect of  the  Sponsor's  account  of  being  deported  from
      Ethiopia to Eritrea in 1999.  Mr Dewison  referred  to  the  grant  of
      guardianship to Saedia, which she referred to as an  "alleged"  grant.
      He referred to the difficulties the Sponsor had in remembering  dates.
      According to the translation  of  the  guardianship  document  in  the
      Respondent's bundle, it was dated  15  March  2004  in  the  Ethiopian
      calendar, which was seven years before the Gregorian calendar, so this
      would make a date in 2011.  According to the guardianship document the
      Sponsor and her husband had separated  owing  to  difficulties  within
      their marriage.  The Sponsor had left and settled in England.  It  was
      stated that the father had fled to Sudan but not that he  was  killed.
      Mr Dewison said it was not accepted on behalf  of  the  ECO  that  the
      Sponsor had been deported  to  Eritrea.   According  to  the  expert's
      report, at page 66, if the Sponsor wanted to live with the children in
      Ethiopia she would have to give up her British citizenship.   The  ECO
      was not requiring her to  do  this  but  was  refusing  entry  to  the
      children.  There was doubt about the circumstances of  the  family  as
      they had been living apart for a long time.  The Sponsor had left  the
      children  fifteen  years  ago.   There  were  inconsistencies  in  the
      evidence.  The question was whether it was reasonable  to  expect  the
      Sponsor to go to Ethiopia to be reunited with the children and in  the
      view of the ECO it was.

  18) For the Claimants, Ms Soltani referred to an appeal determination from
      2006, in which the Sponsor was found to be an Eritrean  national.   It
      was accepted at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal that  there
      were anomalies in the guardianship document but these  were  explained
      on the basis that false statements had been made in  order  to  secure
      the guardianship order.  The dates were consistent with the  Sponsor's
      account.

  19) Ms Soltani submitted that the issues  set  out  by  Judge  Pickup  was
      whether it was legally or physically possible for the mother  and  the
      Claimants to continue their family  life  outside  the  UK.   In  this
      regard Ms Soltani submitted that the expert's report  was  clear.   At
      paragraph 28  of  the  report  the  expert  witness  referred  to  two
      proclamations from 2002 and 2003, the effect of  which  was  that  the
      Sponsor, as an Ethiopian-born ethnic Eritrean  (who  was  deported  in
      1999) would not be allowed to return to Ethiopia on a permanent basis.
       It was not the Sponsor's choice to leave the children behind.   There
      was no reason not to accept her account of  having  been  deported  in
      1999.  Her British passport showed that she was born in Gonder,  which
      was in Ethiopia, but she was given an Ethiopian visa  on  a  temporary
      basis.  The refusal decision stated that she had not seen the children
      since 1999.  It was pointed out she did  not  have  a  passport  until
      2012.  The  guidance  issued  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  Entry
      Clearance Officers required the best interests of the children  to  be
      taken into account.  As the expert report pointed  out  ,there  is  no
      social or healthcare in Ethiopia.  It was suggested by Mr Dewison that
      the Sponsor could renounce her British citizenship to obtain Ethiopian
      citizenship but she would suffer  adverse  consequences  as  a  result
      because of her ill health and this would not  be  proportionate.   The
      additional evidence, including the expert's report,  showed  that  the
      family could not live outside the UK.




Discussion

  20) I had before me only part of the Tribunal's determination of  2006  in
      relation to the Sponsor's asylum appeal.  The final pages  of  it  are
      missing.  However, as Ms Soltani submitted, it was  accepted  at  that
      time that the Sponsor was an Eritrean national.  She is now a  British
      citizen.  Mr Dewison questions the veracity  of  the  Sponsor's  claim
      that she was deported from Ethiopia to Eritrea in  1999.   The  expert
      report is based on the assumption that the  Sponsor  was  deported  in
      1999.  It states, at paragraph 22, the following:

           "On the basis of extensive published research, it was  the  case
           that thousands of  individuals  of  Eritrean  descent/extraction
           whose parents were born in  Eritrea  and  who  did  not  possess
           formal Eritrean nationality were arrested by Ethiopia during the
           border war and deported to Eritrea (Campbell 2013: Chap.1)."

  21) The expert report further comments, at paragraph 34,  that  while  the
      evidence provided by the Sponsor regarding her arrest and  deportation
      from Ethiopia was very limited, her claim to have been  deported  from
      Ethiopia due to her parents' birth in Eritrea was credible.

  22) The Sponsor's account of her deportation accords with  the  background
      evidence.  Her Eritrean origins do not appear to have been  questioned
      in the 2006 appeal.  I  am  therefore  satisfied  on  the  balance  of
      probabilities that the Sponsor  was  deported  at  that  time  as  she
      claimed.

  23) The expert report goes on to state that someone who was  an  Ethiopian
      of Eritrean origin, as previously defined, and  who  was  deported  to
      Eritrea  would  not  be  allowed  to  return  to  Ethiopia   to   live
      permanently.  It is further stated that tens of thousands of Ethiopian-
      born ethnic Eritreans in Ethiopia were stripped of  their  nationality
      during the war with Eritrea.  As the Sponsor's parents  were  born  in
      Eritrea, the Sponsor  was  not  qualified  by  descent  for  Ethiopian
      nationality and she could not meet the  conditions  to  make  a  legal
      application for nationality.  A  previous  registration  exercise  for
      Ethiopian-born ethnic Eritreans was conducted in 2004 and  had  ended.
      The Sponsor would be allowed to reside temporarily in  Ethiopia  as  a
      foreign visitor but she would not be allowed to obtain an  immigration
      visa or stay for the four years required to apply for citizenship.

  24) The expert's report states that the Sponsor and her children would  in
      theory qualify for Eritrean nationality but they would be required  to
      renounce their existing nationality to apply for Eritrean  nationality
      as Eritrea does not recognise dual nationality.  As  the  Sponsor  was
      unable to work and support herself  and  her  children,  however,  she
      would not meet a key criteria for admission into Eritrean nationality.



  25) As I understand the position it is not argued at this stage  that  the
      family  could  reasonably  be  expected  to   relocate   to   Eritrea,
      particularly as the children are becoming of an age where  they  would
      be liable to be called up for national service.  I do  not  understand
      it to be suggested that it would be  in  the  best  interests  of  the
      children for the Sponsor and the Claimants to relocate to Eritrea.

  26)  The  only  reasonable  alternatives  are  residence  in  Ethiopia  or
      residence in the UK.  Although Mr Dewison submitted that  the  Sponsor
      could continue to reside in the UK while  the  Claimants  remained  in
      Ethiopia, this was not the issue identified by  Judge  Pickup  in  the
      Upper Tribunal determination of 29 October 2013.  The  relevant  issue
      was stated as whether the Claimants and their mother could continue or
      develop their family life outside the UK.

  27) On the question of whether the Sponsor could live with the children in
      Ethiopia the answer is now clear.  She has a British passport and  was
      able to obtain an Ethiopian visa to visit the children but that is  as
      far as her rights are recognised as someone of Eritrean  descent.   It
      is not a question, as Mr Dewison suggested, of the Sponsor  renouncing
      her British citizenship and claiming Ethiopian nationality because, as
      the  expert  report  points  out,  she  does  not  meet  the  relevant
      requirements for recognition as an Ethiopian national.

  28) I am satisfied the position is that family life can only be carried on
      legally, and therefore reasonably, having regard to the best interests
      of the children, in the UK.  I do not consider it would be  reasonable
      to expect the Sponsor  to  live  illegally  or  as  an  overstayer  in
      Ethiopia.  As Ms Soltani  pointed  out  there  is  the  issue  of  the
      Sponsor's health as well as the  residence  issue.   Medical  evidence
      before me shows that she suffers from asthma, renal calculi  and  back
      pain.  She  has  difficulty  walking  and  restricted  mobility.   She
      suffers from low mood, worry  and  hopelessness  which  appear  to  be
      caused by her children not being able to live with her in the UK.  She
      described  as  having  moderate  symptoms  of  depression  and  severe
      symptoms of anxiety.

  29) Having regard to the factors set out above, I am  satisfied  that  the
      refusal decisions are disproportionate and that the appeals should  be
      allowed under Article 8 in terms of respect for family life.

Conclusions

  30) The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  found  to
      involve the making of an error on the point of law and  has  been  set
      aside.

  31) I remake the appeals by allowing them.




  32) The Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  neither  an  anonymity
      direction nor a fee award.  For the reasons given by the  judge  I  do
      consider that a fee award  is  appropriate.   I  have  not  heard  any
      submission in respect of anonymity and I do not consider such an order
      to be necessary.
