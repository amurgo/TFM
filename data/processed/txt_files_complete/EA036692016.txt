                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                              NOTICE OF DECSION

      1. In a decision  promulgated  on  27.7.17  Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Shimmin concluded that he had no jurisdiction to entertain
         the appellant's appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision  dated
         15.3.16 to  refuse  his  application  for  an  EEA  residence  card
         pursuant to the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
         2006.  Judge  Shimmin's  decision  relied  on  the  Upper  Tribunal
         decision of Sala [2016] UKUT 0411. This was overturned by the Court
         of Appeal in Khan v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

      2. In the notice of decision dated 14.2.18 I indicated that the  Upper
         Tribunal was minded to find an error of law, set aside the decision
         of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the  case  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal. If either of the parties was opposed to this course  they
         were directed to inform the Tribunal in writing  (giving  reasons),
         not later than 28 days from the date the  Directions  were  issued.
         Following that period, the parties were  informed  that  the  Upper
         Tribunal would issue its decision.

      3. The Upper Tribunal has not received any correspondence from  either
         party within the stipulated timeframe.  In  the  light  of  Khan  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1755,
         the First-tier Tribunal was wrong in law to conclude  that  it  did
         not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

      4. The Upper Tribunal is consequently satisfied  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal's decision is  marred  by  a  material  legal  error  (the
         unlawful view that it lacked jurisdiction).

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by a  material  error  of  law.
The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  (de  novo)
hearing, before  a  judge  other  than  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Shimmin.
