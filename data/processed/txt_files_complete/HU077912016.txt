Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Farrelly promulgated  on  17th  July  2017  following  a
    hearing at Taylor House in which he dismissed the Appellant's appeal on
    human rights grounds.

 2. The Appellant applied on 21st  January  2016  for  entry  clearance  to
    settle as a dependant of his father, who is a former Gurkha soldier and
    was the Sponsor to the application.  His father had  been  issued  with
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom in January 2012  under  the  2009
    agreement and he had come here with his wife.  Judge  Farrelly  in  his
    decision did not accept that family life had existed between the  adult
    Appellant and his father for the purposes of Article 8, but went on  to
    find [at 27] that in any event, even if he is wrong in those  findings,
    that he was not satisfied that  entry  clearance  would  have  occurred
    earlier, in any event, and that therefore he was not satisfied that the
    historic injustice in Gurkha cases applied.

 3. In the grounds of appeal it is argued that the judge applied too high a
    threshold for the existence of family life under Article 8(1) following
    the Court of Appeal decision in the  case  of  Rai  v  Entry  Clearance
    Officer - New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320.  Secondly, it was argued  that
    the judge failed to have regard, when considering whether  family  life
    existed, to the evidence that the Appellant  would  have  sought  entry
    clearance alongside the Sponsor had the family been able to  afford  to
    do so at the time. Further, it is said the judge erred in his  approach
    to financial dependency. Finally, it is argued that the judge failed to
    have regard to relevant matters when determining proportionality  under
    Article 8(2).

 4. I have also considered the Rule 24 response from the  Respondent  dated
    4th October 2017 in which it was argued that it was open to the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge to find that dependency had not been shown  on  the
    evidence presented and that the judge appreciated that money  was  sent
    by the Sponsor and contact maintained, but the judge  found  that  that
    was out of natural love and  affection  and  the  Appellant  maintained
    himself by farming the Sponsor's land and it was  argued  that  it  was
    open to the judge to conclude that family life was not established.  It
    is argued that the judge considered the Appellant's case at its highest
    in any event.

 5. I am grateful for the submissions of Mr Balroop of Counsel who  appears
    on behalf of the Appellant and also Miss Willocks-Briscoe  who  appears
    on behalf of the Secretary of State.

 6. Mr Balroop basically argues that there are in effect two main  problems
    with this judgment.  He submits that the Appellant's  case  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal in respect  of  the  issue  of  dependency  on  the
    evidence was set out in paragraph 7 of the decision and the judge noted
    he heard evidence from the Sponsor and that the Appellant was  said  to
    have studied until the age of 22, but not been able to find employment.
    He had applied for the army, but had not been  accepted.  He  had  some
    land which he worked, but it was too small to make  a  living  out  of.
    The family also received some rental income from land, but it  was  not
    always paid, and  the  judge  had  found  that  the  eldest  child  was
    disabled. The Sponsor had said that he sent  �200  to  �300  every  two
    months for their support.  The Sponsor said he had daily  contact  with
    his children.

 7. The judge in his findings whether or not there was family life noted at
    paragraph 15 the case of Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and made reference
    there also to the cases of Ghising [2013] UKUT  567  and  the  case  of
    Singh v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630.
      The judge found that the Appellant's parents came in early 2012  when
    the Appellant was 27 years old at that stage, which he found  would  be
    considered to be reaching adulthood  and  that  prior  to  his  parents
    coming to the UK the Appellant was not leading an independent life  and
    the family had lived as a unit and they survived through farming.   The
    judge noted the Appellant had not declared any employment, but  studied
    up until the age of 22. The judge found it was clear that the Appellant
    was now farming the land.  Consequently, the judge found that  "it  may
    have been that he was self-employed".  The judge went on to  find  that
    although the parents since coming to the UK had been sending  money  to
    the family, the Appellant was not dependent upon  this  and  money  was
    sent out of natural love and affection with a  view  to  improving  the
    situation of all the remaining children.  He found that he could see no
    reason why they could not maintain their life in Nepal.

 8. It was argued by Mr Balroop that the judge's findings in that regard do
    not really address the issue as to dependency and as to whether or  not
    there is real effective and committed support as described as  being  a
    significant factor necessary in the case of Rai v ECO - New  Delhi,  in
    establishing that there is something more than  normal  emotional  ties
    between the adult Appellant and his parents such as  to  give  rise  to
    family life existing  between  them  for  the  purpose  of  Article  8.
    Although in that regard Miss Willocks-Briscoe concedes that  the  judge
    could have actually expressed himself better, she does not concede  the
    issue on that regard and it is argued on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State that the judge had adequately dealt with the issue of whether  or
    not there is actual dependency and whether or not there is therefore in
    light of any emotional and/or financial dependency more than the normal
    ties of love and affection, such as to give bias to family life for the
    purposes of Article 8.

 9. Mr Balroop argued that the second problem is that  although  the  judge
    has then gone on to find that he would consider what  had  happened  if
    wrong in respect of his findings regarding  family  life,  the  judge's
    reasoning as to why entry clearance would not have occurred earlier had
    it not been for the historic  injustice  is  unclear  and  inadequately
    reasoned. The judge's findings at paragraph 27 were  that  he  was  not
    satisfied that earlier entry clearance would have occurred on the basis
    that the army papers records that the sponsor's elder son had been born
    in January 1977 with a disability and his daughter was born in 1975  in
    Hong Kong, granted a status at that stage which the rest of the  family
    were not, but the sponsor, Appellant's father was  then  discharged  in
    1979 and married in May 1971.  Mr Balroop argues  that  it  was  wholly
    unclear from that paragraph  as  to  the  reasoning  why  the  historic
    injustice did not apply in this case and why  it  was  that  settlement
    would not have occurred earlier  had  it  not  been  for  the  historic
    injustice.   Miss  Willocks-Briscoe  concedes  that  the  reasoning  in
    paragraph 27 of the judge is not clear, but argues  that  only  becomes
    relevant if in fact the judge's consideration of  whether  family  life
    exists or his explanation in respect of that is actually inadequate  or
    insufficient or legally otherwise in error.

    My findings on error of law and materiality

10. In this case the judge clearly considered that  prior  to  his  parents
    coming to the UK in early 2012, the Appellant at  that  stage  was  not
    leading an independent life and that the family lived  as  a  unit  and
    they survived through farming.  At that stage the Appellant was said by
    Judge Farrelly to be 27 years old.  Prior to that the judge  had  found
    that he studied up until the age of 22 and he accepted that he was  now
    farming the land.  The Appellant was said still to be living within the
    family home farming the land owned by his  father  and  planting  crops
    upon that land owned by his father.  Also, it is the  Appellant's  case
    that he was in receipt of some money from  land  owned  by  the  father
    which was rented out and that in addition, as  had  been  said  by  the
    Sponsor in evidence, the children remaining were  being  sent  �200  to
    �300 every two months for their support.

11. The argument effectively being raised before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was that in this case there was both financial  and  emotional  support
    which was real, committed and effective which did mean that there  were
    more than normal emotional ties given  the  level  of  dependency  that
    existed.  Although Judge Farrelly clearly seems to be  of  the  opinion
    that the Appellant was self-employed, on the basis that he was  farming
    the land owned by his father, the issue here  is  whether  or  not,  in
    circumstances where he was farming land owned by his father,  receiving
    some rental income from land owned by his father which was being rented
    out, and also being sent money by his father, whether that amounted  to
    financial dependency, and then whether in light of any  such  financial
    and any emotional dependency whether  or  not  there  was  family  life
    engaged.

12. Sadly, the judge has not really addressed the issue here in respect  of
    this land being owned by the Sponsor, his father, and  whether  farming
    father's land, amounts to dependency upon  the  father.   In  addition,
    although the judge accepts that money has been  sent  he  concludes  in
    paragraph 20 that the Appellant is not dependent upon this,  the  money
    is sent out of natural love and affection with a view to improving  the
    situation of all the remaining children.  Again, in my judgement, sadly
    Judge Farrelly has not adequately explained that  finding.   The  issue
    before him was as to whether or not there was financial  dependency  as
    at the date of the hearing before him,  not  necessarily  in  terms  of
    whether or not there may be financial dependency in the future  if  the
    Appellant were to obtain a different type of job  rather  than  farming
    the parents' land.  The evidence before him was in terms  of  the  fact
    that money had been sent, but he does not say as to why it is he formed
    the view that the Appellant was not dependent upon that as at the  date
    of the hearing before him, why it was simply sent out of  natural  love
    and affection with a  view  to  improving  the  situation  of  all  the
    remaining children or why they would be able to maintain their life  in
    Nepal without it.  He has  not  explained  how,  if  the  appellant  is
    farming his father's land, receiving rental income  from  his  father's
    other land, and being sent financial aid by his father, that  does  not
    amount to financial dependency upon his father.

13. Although Judge Farrelly goes on to consider what the situation would be
    if he was wrong regarding whether or not Article 8 family life  existed
    between the adult Appellant and his  Sponsor,  the  judge  went  on  to
    consider at paragraph 27 whether or  not  entry  clearance  would  have
    occurred earlier in  any  event  and  therefore  whether  the  historic
    injustice in the Gurkha cases applied in this  case.  At  paragraph  27
    Judge Farrelly found that what might have happened is very speculative.
     He stated that the Appellant's  father  was  discharged  in  1979,  he
    married in May 1971.  The army papers records that his eldest son, born
    in January 1977, was born with a disability.  His daughter who was born
    in 1975 in Hong Kong was granted a status at that stage which the  rest
    of the family were not.  He was not satisfied earlier  entry  clearance
    would  have  occurred.   As   Miss   Willocks-Briscoe   concedes,   the
    explanation and reasoning given  by  the  learned  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge in that paragraph seems somewhat disjointed and does not fully or
    adequately explain why it is that simply the Sponsor being  married  in
    1971 with his eldest son being born in January 1977 with  a  disability
    and his daughter being born in 1975 in Hong Kong, when the  Appellant's
    father was then discharged in 1979, two years after his eldest son  was
    born, means that the situation was speculative, and does not adequately
    explain why in such circumstances the Judge not  satisfied  that  entry
    clearance would have occurred earlier.

14. The evidence before the First-tier Judge in terms  of  statements  from
    the Sponsor, Mr Bhim Prasad Rai, was to the effect in  paragraph  4  he
    says he was discharged from the army with  exemplary  conduct.  He  was
    merely 33 years old when he was discharged from the army in 1979  after
    fifteen years long service, and in paragraph 5 he said  that  he  could
    easily have secured a job in the UK as a security or other officer in a
    related field, and there was no policy for settlement in the UK at  the
    time, otherwise he would have settled here long ago with his family and
    would have been able to provide facilities to his children  which  they
    did not have in Nepal.  His evidence was that had  he  been  given  the
    opportunity to settle in the UK at the time of his retirement from  the
    army service he would have taken it and settled here with his wife  and
    children and his family would not have been  separated  from  him.   He
    goes on to explain in paragraph 6 of his statement how he  married  his
    wife in 1971 during the army service.  He was on leave of duty for  six
    months after continuous service of three years, but then had to  rejoin
    the service in Hong  Kong  and  his  wife  remained  in  Nepal  in  his
    ancestral home and he next visited his wife in Nepal after three years.
    He says that it was in 1974 that he brought his wife with him  to  Hong
    Kong where his eldest daughter was born in Hong Kong in 1975  and  that
    she was later recognised as a British national overseas and they  lived
    there for two-and-half years before his battalion then moved to  Brunei
    where he lived with his wife and daughter for a further six months  and
    his son Gobinkumar was born in Brunei in January 1977. The sponsor then
    explained in paragraph 7 that he was given an option to take  leave  of
    six months or continue living with the family and  retiring  after  two
    years more service and he opted for the latter option.

15. The Sponsor's evidence has not been adequately addressed by the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  and  no  adequate  reasons  have  been  given  for
    rejecting or disputing that evidence within the decision  at  paragraph
    27.  It certainly does not follow and I agree with the concession  made
    by Miss  Willocks-Briscoe  in  that  regard  that  that  has  not  been
    adequately explained, and simply the fact that one was married in  1971
    and had a child born with a disability in 1977 with a daughter born  in
    1975 in Hong Kong does not explain why it is that  when  discharged  in
    1979 he would not have done what he said he would have done,  in  terms
    of coming to the UK, had he been able to do so at that time.

16. In such circumstances, in my judgement,  regrettably  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly does contain material errors of law.
    I cannot be satisfied having read the decision  that  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly would necessarily have been the same
    had those errors not been made, and therefore I do find that the errors
    of law in that regard are material errors.

17. It has been agreed by both legal representatives before me that further
    fact-finding will need to be made, both in  terms  of  whether  or  not
    family life exists in this case and the balancing exercise taking  into
    account  any  historic  injustice.  Both  parties  agreed  that  it  is
    appropriate for the case to be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal
    to be  reheard  before  any  First-tier  Judge  other  than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Farrelly.  It has not been sought to be  argued  by  the
    legal representatives that there should be preserved findings of  fact.
    I therefore do set aside the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Farrelly, the same containing material errors of law and  I  remit  the
    case back to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing  before  any  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly.

Notice of Decision

18. The  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Farrelly  does  contain
    material errors of law and is set aside.  The case is remitted back  to
    the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing before  any  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly.

19. No order for anonymity was made before the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    and no such order has been sought before me today and  therefore  I  do
    not make any order in respect of anonymity.
