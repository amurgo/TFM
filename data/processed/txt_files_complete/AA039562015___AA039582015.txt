                         NOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL

The appellants are nationals of Armenia, mother and son, born on  15  August
1984 and 12 October 2013.  They appealed against a determination  by  First-
tier Tribunal Judge Debra Clapham, dated 27 May 2015.  The case  was  listed
to be heard  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  as  above.   By  letters  from  their
solicitors dated and received on 20 November 2015 they sought  to  withdraw.
In terms of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  rule  17,
the appeals are recorded as having been withdrawn, with the consent  of  the
Upper Tribunal.  The determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  therefore
stands.
