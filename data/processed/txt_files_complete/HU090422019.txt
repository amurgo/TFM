For the Appellant:     Mr Briddock, Counsel instructed by Light House
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A. Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka date of  birth  12th  November
    1980. He seeks entry clearance to be  able  to  settle  in  the  United
    Kingdom with his wife, Mrs Kowshika Thiruvilangam.

 2. The Respondent  accepted  that  the  Appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with Mrs Thiruvilangam, that he met the English
    language requirements and that the household income was  in  excess  of
    the 'minimum  income  requirement'.  The  application  was  nonetheless
    refused. The Respondent found that the Appellant had previously spent a
    period of time in the United Kingdom without leave to  do  so;  he  had
    failed to report as required and had been listed as  an  absconder.  As
    such his application fell to be refused  with  reference  to  paragraph
    320(11) of the Immigration Rules.

 3. By its decision dated the 3rd February  2020  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Chana) agreed and the appeal was dismissed.  The  Appellant  was
    granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal on the 18th May 2020.

    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

 4. Paragraph 320(11) is one of the 'General Grounds for Refusal' found  at
    part 9 of the Immigration Rules. It reads:

         Grounds on which entry clearance  or  leave  to  enter  the  United
         Kingdom should normally be refused

         ...

         (11) where the applicant has previously contrived in a  significant
         way to frustrate the intentions of the Rules by:

             (i)  overstaying; or

             (ii) breaching a condition attached to his leave; or

             (iii)    being an illegal entrant; or

             (iv) using deception in an application  for  entry  clearance,
             leave to enter or remain or in order to obtain documents  from
             the Secretary of State or a third party required in support of
             the application (whether successful or not);

         and there are other aggravating circumstances, such as  absconding,
         not meeting  temporary  admission/reporting  restrictions  or  bail
         conditions, using  an  assumed  identity  or  multiple  identities,
         switching  nationality,  making  frivolous  applications   or   not
         complying with the re-documentation process.

         (emphasis added).

 5.  Paragraph  320(11)  does  not  mandate  that  applications  by  former
    overstayers are rejected: it prompts the decision maker  to  conduct  a
    three  stage  enquiry.  First,  has  the  individual  contrived  in   a
    significant way to contravene the rules, for instance  by  overstaying.
    Second, are there aggravating circumstances: the rule provides  a  non-
    exhaustive set of examples,  which  vary  in  severity  from  breaching
    reporting conditions  to  the  use  of  multiple  identities.    In  PS
    (paragraph 320(11) - discretion - care needed)  India  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home  Department  [2010]  UKUT  440  (IAC)  the  Tribunal
    pointed to the public policy aims underpinning  this  second  question.
    It is in  the  public  interest  that  overstayers  are  encouraged  to
    regularise their positions. It is in the public interest - as reflected
    in Appendix FM - that if they wish to  do  so  by  reference  to  their
    Article 8 rights they should do so by first returning to their  country
    of origin and making an application for entry clearance in the ordinary
    way.  It might not be in the  public  interest  however,  to  recognise
    Article 8 rights of such immigration offenders where the breaches  were
    flagrant or, in the words of the Tribunal "truly aggravating" [at �14].
     If the decision maker finds that both of these initial tests are  met,
    he or she must finally consider whether,  the  presumption  of  refusal
    notwithstanding,  the  Article  8  rights   of   the   subject   should
    nevertheless prevail.

 6. In this case there was no issue about the first question. The Appellant
    undoubtedly remained in the United  Kingdom  without  leave  after  his
    asylum application was rejected.

 7. The Entry Clearance Officer considered that the  second  test  was  met
    because the available records showed that the Appellant had  failed  to
    report when required: on the facts this does not appear to be in issue,
    as it is certainly not suggested on the part of the Appellant  that  he
    had maintained contact with the Home Office in  the  9  years  that  he
    remained here without leave.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  rejected  the
    ECO's view on this point: at its �28  it  found  that  "absconding  and
    overstaying  in  themselves   may   not   be   considered   aggravating
    circumstances".   In the absence of any evidence  or  particulars  from
    the ECO I am satisfied that this was a finding open to the  Judge.  One
    can envisage a case where an applicant persistently sought to evade the
    immigration authorities or breached the terms  of  his  bail  and  this
    could amount to "truly aggravating" circumstances, but in a  case  such
    as this it is hard to separate the act of absconding  itself  from  the
    overstaying - by their nature one must be preceded by the  other.   One
    failure to report and 'going to ground' cannot logically be said to  be
    aggravating since that in itself amounts to overstaying.

 8. Having rejected the Respondent's case the Tribunal did not however stop
    there. It found reasons of its own to  consider  that  the  Appellant's
    behaviour was truly aggravating.   At its �28 the Tribunal  finds  that
    the length of time that the Appellant spent in the UK brings  his  case
    "within the ambit" of the rule. That proposition finds  no  support  in
    either the rules or published policy.  Nowhere  is  it  said  that  the
    length of time that a person  spends  living  without  leave  might  be
    relevant to this enquiry. Had the rule intended to create  a  'cut-off'
    period of time below which overstaying would be overlooked, but  beyond
    which it would be fatal to any future application, it would  have  said
    so.   The  illogicality  of  the  Tribunal's  conclusion   is   further
    illustrated  by  paragraph  276ADE(1)   (iii).   This   provides   that
    overstayers who remain in the  United  Kingdom  for  twenty  years  are
    permitted to remain indefinitely on the basis  of  their  private  life
    rights, yet here the Tribunal has concluded that a far  shorter  period
    of overstaying is sufficiently aggravating to justify interference with
    family life rights.

 9. The second reason found  by  the  Tribunal  to  amount  to  aggravating
    circumstances is set out at its �29:

         "The other aggravating circumstance is that the appellant  made  an
         application for asylum based on his Tamil  ethnicity  but  returned
         voluntarily to Sri Lanka, in order to marry and make an application
         for entry clearance.  This  demonstrates  to  me  that  he  made  a
         frivolous application for asylum..."

10. The Appellant, a Tamil, arrived in this country to seek  protection  on
    the 10th May 2009.  On the day that he claimed asylum the  war  against
    the Tamil Tigers was reaching its climax, with what the UN described as
    the "large scale killing of civilians" in full swing.  It is unclear to
    me whether Judge Chana had before her  the  findings  of  the  Tribunal
    which dismissed the Appellant's asylum appeal in June 2010, but against
    the country background it  seems  unlikely  that  it  would  have  been
    described as "frivolous". It was not a  claim  that  was  for  instance
    certified as manifestly unfounded; nor was  it  one  of  many,  or  one
    plainly made to frustrate removal, all of which might  be  claims  that
    could properly be described as frivolous. Not being entitled to  asylum
    is not the same as making a frivolous application.   Nor does the  fact
    that the appellant chose to voluntarily return to Sri  Lanka  some  ten
    years later render the original application so.

11. For the foregoing reasons I am satisfied that in its  consideration  of
    the second limb of the 320(11) enquiry the  Tribunal  erred  in  taking
    immaterial matters into account and erring in fact.   It follow that  I
    need  not  address  those  grounds  which  challenge   the   First-tier
    Tribunal's approach to  the  final  question  raised  under  320(11)  -
    whether it was proportionate to  refuse  entry  to  the  husband  of  a
    British national who meets all of the substantive requirements  of  the
    rules because nine years ago he became an overstayer.

    The Re-Made Decision

12. I therefore proceed to remake the decision in the appeal. I invited  Mr
    Tan to address me on what the truly aggravating  matters  might  be  in
    this case.   He revived the original ground for refusal, discounted  by
    Judge Chana: the fact that the Appellant failed to report.  As  I  note
    above, it cannot be said that any failure to report, or any  period  of
    absconding, will necessarily elevate the  circumstances  beyond  simply
    overstaying. It is for the Respondent to demonstrate that in this  case
    the breach was of sufficient severity to warrant refusal under 320(11).
    The  Respondent's  bundle  contains  a  letter  from   the   government
    department then known as  the  United  Kingdom  Border  Agency.  It  is
    addressed to Mr Fernando at an address in Salford, and informs him that
    he has failed to report as required to Dallas Court enforcement  office
    on the 2nd July 2009. The letter itself is dated  the  4th  July  2009.
    That is the only actual evidence of the breach. What is striking  about
    this is that it would appear that if Mr Fernando did then  abscond,  he
    cannot have done so for very long, since his asylum claim was  at  that
    stage outstanding, and as far as I am aware, was not refused  for  non-
    compliance with the process. Indeed, we know that Mr Fernando was still
    engaged in the system  because  the  following  year  he  appealed  the
    eventual refusal of his claim to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  his  case
    being dismissed on the 10th June 2010. Mr Tan tells me that  the  dates
    given in the refusal notice - that the period of  absconding  began  on
    the 23rd July 2010 - are taken from the central electronic record  that
    he had before him during our remote hearing. I have no reason to  doubt
    that - it seems logical that once  someone  is  deemed  'appeal  rights
    exhausted' as Mr Fernando would have been  some  six  weeks  after  his
    appeal was dismissed, that they would be so recorded.

13. I proceed on the basis that on one occasion in July 2009 the  Appellant
    failed to report at Dallas Court. I have to assume  that  this  failure
    was resolved at the time to the satisfaction of the Secretary of  State
    because there is no indication that  the  was  thereafter  detained  or
    otherwise penalised. I know that  he  was  back  in  contact  with  the
    Secretary of State by the following April  because  this  was  when  he
    received the notification that his asylum claim had been  rejected  and
    lodged his appeal.  I therefore attach little weight to this failure to
    report. Although I have no evidence that this is the  case  I  am  also
    prepared to proceed on the basis that  after  the  Appellant  lost  his
    appeal he 'went to ground'  and  the  Home  Office  listed  him  as  an
    absconder. I am not satisfied that this is behaviour  that  brings  him
    within the ambit of "aggravating circumstances": much like the  illegal
    working considered  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  ZH  (Bangladesh)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA  8  disappearing
    from view is part and parcel of such overstaying.

14. If I am wrong and it should be considered aggravating, considering  all
    of the circumstances I am nevertheless satisfied that it would today be
    disproportionate to refuse entry clearance to a husband who  wishes  to
    settle in the  United  Kingdom  with  his  British  wife,  and  who  is
    otherwise able to meet all of the substantive requirements of  Appendix
    FM.  The 'aggravating' feature here relates to a decision made in  2009
    when the Appellant had not yet met his wife. Once he met  her,  he  did
    what must be recognised as the right thing: he returned to Sri Lanka in
    order to take his place in the queue of family  members  seeking  entry
    clearance.  This decision amounts to a lack of respect not just for his
    family life, but for hers. The effect of this decision  would  be  that
    his sponsor wife is punished for a decision her husband made long  ago.
    She would be asked to give up the totality of her life in this  country
    because of that choice that he made. His was not a heinous,  persistent
    or flagrant breach. In all of the circumstances I am satisfied that the
    impact of this decision upon the parties would be unjustifiably  harsh.



    Decisions

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  errors  of  law  such
    that it must be set aside in its entirety.

16. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows: the appeal is  allowed
    on human rights grounds.

17. There is no order for anonymity.
