For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Rukhsana Bibi, was born on 10 July 1985 and is a  female
    citizen of Pakistan.  She appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Chana) against a decision of the respondent dated 26 November  2015  to
    refuse her further leave to remain as the spouse of a person settled in
    the United Kingdom.  In addition  to  refusing  the  application  under
    paragraph 285 of HC 395 (as amended), the respondent  also  refused  it
    under paragraph 322(1A) because  the  respondent  considered  that  the
    appellant had submitted a false document in connection with a  previous
    application  for  leave.   The  First-tier  Tribunal,  in  a   decision
    promulgated on 27 February 2017, dismissed the appeal.   The  appellant
    now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is married to the sponsor, Mr Ditta.  Mr Ditta  has  been
    married previously.  In connection with  an  application  made  by  the
    appellant to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  (she  had  entered  as  a
    fiancï¿½e) a divorce decree  absolute  dated  5  January  2011  had  been
    submitted to the Secretary of State.  All parties now accept that  that
    decree absolute was a false document.  Indeed, Mr Ditta  had  not  been
    divorced as at that date.  He was subsequently divorced from his  first
    wife and a further decree absolute (this time,  the  parties  agree,  a
    genuine one) had been filed in support of the instant  application  and
    is dated 2013.  Judge Chana  determined  the  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds only but she took account of the fact that  the  appellant  had
    been regarded by the respondent as  unsuitable  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and found also that the allegation that the appellant had  relied
    in a previous application on a false document had been  proved  by  the
    Secretary of State.  Those  findings  clearly  had  an  impact  on  the
    judge's assessment of the public  interest  proportionality  assessment
    for Article 8 ECHR.  There are three  children  of  the  appellant  and
    sponsor, all under the age of  10  years.   The  children  are  British
    citizens.  Notwithstanding their nationality, the judge found  that  it
    would be proportionate for the appellant to be removed finding that the
    children were very young and "therefore adaptable" and could leave  the
    United Kingdom with the appellant and sponsor  and  enjoy  family  life
    together abroad.

 3. There is a problem with the judge's analysis.  As the  grounds  assert,
    she had made no reference to  Section  117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act  (as
    amended):

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.

 4. In addition, the judge failed  to  consider  the  respondent's  current
    policy in respect of British children: see of SF and others  (Guidance,
    post-2014 Act) Albania [2017] UKUT 120(IAC)):

         Even in the absence of a "not in accordance with the law" ground of
         appeal, the Tribunal ought to take the Secretary of State's
         guidance into account if it points clearly to a particular outcome
         in the instant case. Only in that way can consistency be obtained
         between those cases that do, and those cases that do not, come
         before the Tribunal.

 5. In the circumstances and in particular given the British nationality of
    the children, the judge's failure to have regard to Section 117B(6) has
    vitiated her decision.  I therefore set it aside.

 6. Fresh evidence produced by the appellant shows that the  solicitor  who
    had acted for her  husband  and  had  produced  the  fraudulent  decree
    absolute has been investigated by the Solicitors  Regulation  Authority
    and has been prosecuted for fraudulent practices.  There  was  evidence
    also that  the  police  have  not  only  refrained  from  bringing  any
    prosecution  against  the  sponsor  for  having   colluded   with   the
    solicitor's fraudulent practices but have stated that the  sponsor  and
    appellant are themselves likely to have been victims in the  fraud  and
    did not know when they obtained it and subsequently sought to rely upon
    it in the immigration application that the decree absolute was a  false
    document.  I am aware also that no attempt had been made to  rely  upon
    the false document in the application  which  is  the  subject  of  the
    present appeal; there is, on the other hand, evidence to show that  the
    genuine  decree  absolute  of  2013  was  filed  in  support   of   the
    application.  Mrs Pettersen,  for  the  respondent,  did  not  seek  to
    persuade me that the circumstances in this  case  were  such  that  the
    public  interest  required  the  removal  of  this  appellant  and  her
    separation from children with whom she has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship and who are British citizens.  Accordingly, I  remake  the
    decision allowing it on human rights grounds.

Notice of Decision

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  27
    February  2017  is  set  aside.   I  have  remade  the  decision.   The
    appellant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State dated
    26 November 2015 is allowed on human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).

 8. No anonymity direction is made.
