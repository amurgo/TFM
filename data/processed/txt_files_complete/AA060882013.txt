Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr O Manley, instructed by Gloucester Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither  party  invited
    me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

 2. The appellant is a citizen of China who was born on 28 April  1985  and
    comes from the Guangdong Province.  She arrived in the  United  Kingdom
    on 21 March 2010.  She was arrested in Bristol  on  29  November  2012.
    The following day she claimed asylum.   At  the  time,  she  was  seven
    months pregnant and she has subsequently given birth to a  daughter  in
    January 2013.  On 7 June 2013,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the
    appellant's claim for asylum and humanitarian protection and also  that
    her removal would breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 6 August 2013, Judge Trevaskis dismissed the appellant's
    appeal under the Refugee Convention and also under Arts 2, 3 and  8  of
    the ECHR.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal (DJ Appleyard) granted the appellant permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  Thus, the appeal  was  listed  before
    me.

Discussion

 5. At the hearing, Mr  Manley  developed  the  three  grounds  upon  which
    permission to appeal had been granted.

 6. First, he submitted that the judge had failed to give  the  appellant's
    claim "anxious scrutiny and care" as, in para 44 of his  determination,
    he had referred to the appellant "and his partner" giving evidence when
    that was not the case and that in both paras 44 and 54  the  judge  had
    referred to the appellant as being male when, in  fact,  the  appellant
    was female.  In my judgment, there is no merit  in  this  ground.   The
    reference to the  appellant  as  "he"  in  para  54  could  well  be  a
    typographical error.  I accept that it is more  difficult  to  see  the
    reference to "his partner" (meaning  the  appellant's  partner)  giving
    evidence as a typographical slip.  It clearly was  not.   There  is  no
    explanation of why the judge said this when no one  but  the  appellant
    gave evidence before him.  However, in itself, this does not  establish
    that the judge's decision cannot stand providing  the  judge  otherwise
    fully considered the appellant's evidence and dealt appropriately  with
    it in making sustainable findings.  Those are, in  effect,  the  issues
    raised by Mr Manley in grounds 2 and 3 which he developed before me.

 7. Secondly, therefore, Mr Manley submitted  that  the  judge  had  failed
    properly to take into account the objective evidence  relevant  to  the
    appellant's claim.

 8. Thirdly, he submitted that the judge had not properly  carried  out  an
    assessment of the "best interests" of the appellant's child  again,  in
    part, failing to take into account all the background evidence relevant
    to the  appellant's  claim  as  to  the  consequences  she  would  face
    returning to China as an unmarried woman  with  a  child  born  out  of
    wedlock.

 9. I will take Mr Manley's second and third grounds together.  However,  I
    should point out that on the conclusion of Mr Manley's submissions,  Mr
    Richards accepted that the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  could  not
    stand, either in relation to the appellant's claim  under  the  Refugee
    Convention (and Arts 2 and 3 of the ECHR) and also under Art 8  of  the
    ECHR.

10. Before the judge, the appellant's claim to international protection was
    put on two bases.  First, she claimed that she was at risk  from  "loan
    sharks" to whom she was indebted for the  money  that  allowed  her  to
    travel to the UK.  At paras 44-53 the judge gave a  number  of  reasons
    for concluding that he did not accept her account as credible.  At para
    54, the judge went on, in the light of that finding, to  conclude  that
    the appellant had not established that she was at risk from loan sharks
    or at risk as a failed asylum seeker on return to China.

11. Mr Manley did not seek to challenge  the  judge's  adverse  credibility
    finding or his conclusion on  risk  that  followed  from  that  finding
    either in the grounds or in his oral submissions.  Instead,  Mr  Manley
    submitted that the judge had failed to consider the  alternative  basis
    upon which she claimed to be at  risk  on  return,  namely  that  as  a
    returning unmarried woman with a child she would be at risk  of  forced
    sterilisation.  Mr Manley submitted that the judge had simply  made  no
    finding in relation to that  and  had  not  considered  the  background
    evidence relevant to it.

12. There is no answer to Mr  Manley's  submission  on  this  point  as  Mr
    Richards readily accepted in his submissions.

13. At para 34, the judge set out  the  respondent's  submission  that  the
    appellant would not be at real risk  of  forced  sterilisation  if  she
    returned to China and at para  42  he  also  set  out  the  appellant's
    submission that she would be at risk of sterilisation because  she  had
    flouted the law.  The judge did not,  however,  make  any  findings  in
    relation to that aspect of the appellant's claim and whether or not she
    would be at real risk on return to her home area in Guangdong Province.



14. Both representatives referred me to the country  guidance  case  of  AX
    (Family planning scheme) China CG [2012]  UKUT  00097  (IAC).   It  was
    common ground that the Upper Tribunal had not ruled  out  a  successful
    claim  based  upon  an  individual  facing  a  real  risk   of   forced
    sterilisation where, for example, the individual was being returned  at
    a time when there was a crackdown in her area accompanied  by  unlawful
    practices such as forced sterilisation.  Mr Manley drew to my attention
    a number of background documents in the  appellant's  bundle  that  was
    before the judge and, in  particular,  a  document  at  page  6  headed
    "China's One-Child Policy Gets Worse" dated 18 June 2013 which  records
    recent reports from the Guangdong Province that the  "one-child  policy
    is once again on the rise"  and  that  women  are  being  targeted  for
    sterilisation.  The report goes on to state that  those  who  have  one
    child are being forced  to  wear  IUDs  and  that  those  who  bear  an
    "illegal" child are being denied all government  services  which  means
    that they must live without access to  schools,  hospitals,  retirement
    benefits, etc.  Suffices that I quote those opening  comments  of  that
    document to demonstrate that there was at least  some  evidence  before
    the judge that a "crackdown" was in existence in the  appellant's  home
    area in June 2013.  The judge did not consider this evidence or AX  and
    reach any finding in relation to the alternative basis upon  which  the
    appellant put her claim to international protection, namely that  there
    was a real risk of her being subject to  forced  sterilisation  in  her
    particular circumstances on  return.   In  failing  to  do  so,  as  Mr
    Richards accepted, the judge erred in law  and  the  decision  on  that
    aspect of her claim remains to be made.

15. In relation to  Mr  Manley's  submission  in  respect  of  the  judge's
    assessment of Art 8 and the "best interests" of the appellant's  child,
    the judge dealt with this  not  under  Art  8  but  under  the  heading
    "discretionary leave" which is in itself  surprising  since  the  issue
    fell to be considered as part  of  the  assessment  of  proportionality
    under Art 8.  The judge does not appear in paras 64-70 to have  reached
    a conclusion on where the best interests of the appellant's child  lay.
    These failings, in themselves, leave the judge's  decision  to  dismiss
    the appeal under Art 8 flawed.

16. But, in any event, the judge failed to  take  into  account  the  wide-
    ranging  background  evidence  concerning  the  implications  for   the
    appellant as an unmarried woman with a single child  returning  to  her
    province of Guangdong.  As Mr Manley pointed out, the  judge  concluded
    that the financial penalty which the appellant would face (as a  result
    of having a daughter born out of wedlock) could be paid by  instalments
    and so the appellant and her daughter would not be deprived  of  social
    benefits such as healthcare and education.  That finding, as Mr  Manley
    pointed out, failed to take into account the  evidence  concerning  the
    level of such penalties and that the  payment  by  instalment  must  be
    completed within three years.

17. I agree with Mr Manley that the judge was required to grapple with  the
    evidence relied upon which showed that the penalties were  high  for  a
    married couple  but  were  double  for  a  single  woman  such  as  the
    appellant.  Mr Manley pointed to a document at page 12  of  the  bundle
    which, although dealing with another  province,  namely  Wuhan,  stated
    that women who have children out of wedlock could be  fined  more  than
    �17,000.  In addition, the document at page 6 to which I  have  already
    made reference states that an "illegal" child (which of  course  covers
    the appellant's child born out of wedlock)  is  denied  all  government
    services including  access  to  schools,  hospitals,  etc.   Mr  Manley
    accepted that the appellant could not succeed under Art 3 of  ECHR  but
    that the judge  had  failed  properly  to  consider  these  matters  in
    determining whether Art 8 would be breached.

18. As I have indicated, Mr Richards accepted that the judge's decision  in
    relation to Art 8 could not stand.

Decision and Disposal

19. For the above reasons, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appellant's appeal involved the making of an error of  law.
    The judge's decision to dismiss the appeal under the Refugee Convention
    and Arts 3 and 8 of the ECHR must be remade.

20. Both representatives invited me to remit the appeal to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to  remake  the  decision.   That,  in  my  judgment,  is  the
    appropriate disposal of this appeal having regard to para  7.2  of  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement, in particular,  the  nature  and
    extent  of  fact-finding  required  on  the  basis  of  the  background
    evidence.

21. In remaking the decision, the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
    paras 44-53 shall stand as shall the  judge's  conclusion  in  para  54
    based on the findings at paras 44-53.   In  other  words,  the  judge's
    adverse credibility finding shall stand and also his finding  that  the
    appellant would not be at risk from loan sharks on return.

22. The issues for the First-tier Tribunal will be  whether  the  appellant
    has established a real risk of  persecution  or  serious  ill-treatment
    contrary to Art 3 on the basis of the consequences to her of the  'one-
    child policy' on return to  China,  in  particular  a  risk  of  forced
    sterilisation.  In addition, the appellant's claim under Art 8  of  the
    ECHR should be determined de novo and the judge's findings in paras 62-
    70 are not preserved.

23. Consequently, the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal (to  be
    heard by a judge other than Judge Trevaskis) to remake the decision  in
    accordance with the above.
