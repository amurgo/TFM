For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant in this case is a citizen of Zimbabwe who  first  entered
    the UK on 26 December 1999 as a visitor with valid leave until 26  June
    2000.   Her  leave  was  then  varied  to  leave  as  a  student.   The
    appellant's final leave to remain in the UK expired on 31 October  2006
    with further applications in June and November 2010 being refused.  The
    appellant applied for leave to remain under the ten year partner  route
    under Appendix FM in September 2015.  That application was  refused  on
    18 December 2015.  In a Decision and Reasons, promulgated on 7 February
    2017,  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Mulholland  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal against that decision  under  human  rights  grounds
    under Article 8.

 2. The appellant appeals with permission from the Upper  Tribunal  on  the
    following grounds:

    Ground 1:     The Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  finding
                that there would be no interference with family  life  under
                Article 8;

    Ground 2:     The First-tier Tribunal erred  in  giving  no  cumulative
                weight to relevant factors  when  assessing  whether  family
                life could be expected to be enjoyed in Zimbabwe;

    Ground 3:     It was an error not to consider all factors  cumulatively
                when considering Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

Error of Law Discussion

 3. For the reasons set out below I am not satisfied that any error of  law
    is disclosed and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

 4. Ms Nizami submitted that the judge's findings, at [46] of the  Decision
    and  Reasons  where  the  judge  found  that  there  would  not  be  an
    interference with the appellant's family life as the only  family  life
    was with her spouse and in the judge's findings they can go to Zimbabwe
    as a family, were in error.  This was  on  the  basis  of  the  judge's
    earlier findings: although it was accepted that the appellant no longer
    relied on the Rules (as she did not have lawful leave at  the  time  of
    the application) the judge as  part  of  her  Article  8  consideration
    considered that, at [29], although  the  appellant  could  not  succeed
    under the Rules she had to look through the  lens  of  the  Rules  when
    considering the Article 8 claim.  The judge  therefore  considered  the
    relevant tests in Appendix FM, in some detail, including whether  there
    would be insurmountable obstacles to family life outside of the UK  and
    the judge made detailed and reasoned findings from paragraphs  [24]  to
    [38].

 5. The Tribunal's  findings  included  that,  having  considered  all  the
    evidence in relation to the appellant,  who  is  47  years  old  and  a
    Zimbabwean national with qualifications who has lived most of her  life
    in Zimbabwe, that she could return to Zimbabwe and be assisted  by  her
    family and friends in reintegrating.  The judge went on to consider her
    spouse.  The judge noted, including at [35], that  her  spouse  is  69.
    She also noted that the appellant claimed to be her husband's carer and
    that he could not go with her "as he is  working  and  suffers  from  a
    panic disorder".  The appellant also asserted that her husband's mental
    health would deteriorate should he be re-exposed  to  Africa  where  he
    served in the armed forces and  suffered  a  breakdown.   However,  the
    judge took into consideration that the appellant's spouse was a British
    citizen and was prepared to accept that he was in a demanding  job  and
    set out his income.  The judge  took into consideration, at [34],  that
    she had before her medical  evidence  and  it  was  accepted  that  the
    appellant's husband suffers from a panic disorder  although  the  judge
    noted that the last  attack  was  five  years  ago  and  that  he  only
    occasionally suffers from the  condition  and  the  judge  reached  the
    finding which, I am satisfied, was open to her, that this condition was
    managed by medication and that he  had  suffered  from  this  condition
    since 2007, long before he met the appellant, but despite the condition
    has been able to live and work in the UK.  The judge  concluded,  in  a
    finding which I am satisfied was open to her on the evidence, that  any
    assistance the appellant provides her husband is minimal and  could  be
    provided by other family members if he remained in the  UK  whilst  the
    appellant sought entry  clearance  or  could  be  provided  by  her  in
    Zimbabwe should they return together.

 6. The judge gave full consideration to the assertion that the appellant's
    spouse's mental health would deteriorate if re-exposed to Africa, given
    that he has spent time there in the armed forces.  However,  the  judge
    found that there was limited information in support of this  claim  and
    noted that despite this claim the appellant's spouse had never actually
    been to Zimbabwe and had not been exposed to any harm there.  The judge
    therefore reached a conclusion, which she gave adequate reasons for and
    which could not be said to reach the high bar  of  irrationality,  that
    she was not satisfied that his mental health would deteriorate there to
    any material extent and that the appellant could assist him.   Equally,
    she was not satisfied that there was any evidence  that  his  condition
    could not be treated in Zimbabwe.  The judge on a number  of  occasions
    accepted, and clearly fully appreciated, that  the  appellant's  spouse
    was 69, but was entitled to reach the conclusion that he was a "fit  69
    year old" including given that he was  working.   I  am  not  satisfied
    there was anything irrational in her conclusion that  despite  his  age
    that he could continue working and that he had over ï¿½2,200 in  pensions
    and benefits, which would allow the couple to resettle.

 7. The Tribunal, in a very comprehensive  consideration,  considered  that
    there was no evidence presented that he would have  any  difficulty  in
    applying for entry in Zimbabwe and she  was  satisfied  that  he  could
    apply and remain there.  The judge also took  into  consideration  that
    the burden was with the appellant and that neither she nor  her  spouse
    had made any material efforts to establish what  life  would  hold  for
    them in Zimbabwe.

 8. It was on the basis of  these  findings  that  the  judge  reached  the
    conclusion that she did, at [46], that there would be  no  interference
    with family life given that she was satisfied  that  the  couple  could
    relocate together.

 9. Ms Nizami took me  to  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal,  including
    witness statements from the sponsor, that he did not see why  it  would
    be considered reasonable for him to leave  his  country.   The  judge's
    findings reflect the evidence in that she noted the evidence  from  the
    appellant that her husband did not want to go  to  Africa.   Ms  Nizami
    accepted however, that there was  no  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the appellant's husband would refuse to go to Zimbabwe.

10. It was also argued by Ms Nizami that the  First-tier  Judge  failed  to
    properly apply the principles in Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  40  in
    circumstances where Ms Nizami argued that there was an acceptance  that
    the appellant would likely meet the Immigration Rules, was in a genuine
    relationship with a 69 year old British citizen and  the  judge  should
    have considered whether it was proportionate to expect the appellant to
    make an application outside the UK.

11. However, the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, when considering Article
    8 outside of the Rules, considered the Chikwamba principle including in
    the context of the most recent Tribunal guidance on  Chikwamba:  R  (on
    the application of Chen) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    (Appendix FM - Chikwamba  -  temporary  separation  -  proportionality)
    (IJR) [2015] UKUT 00189.  This included the principle that there may be
    cases where there are no insurmountable obstacles to family  life,  but
    where  temporary  separation   may   be   disproportionate.    However,
    Chikwamba: R (on the application of Chen) further confirms (as set  out
    by the judge) that:

         "in all cases it will be for the individual  to  place  before  the
         Secretary of State evidence that  such  temporary  separation  will
         interfere disproportionately with protected rights. It will not  be
         enough to rely solely upon the case law concerning Chikwamba v SSHD
         [2008] UKHL 40".

    The judge stated that she was not prepared to speculate on the  outcome
    of an application but  indicated,  at  [40],  that  she  had  not  been
    presented with evidence of the appellant's knowledge of English and  at
    [41] that she had no information before her  to  demonstrate  that  all
    other aspects of the test would be met and, again,  that  she  was  not
    prepared to speculate.  In that context, where it cannot be shown  that
    it was certain that the appellant would be successful, albeit  that  it
    was accepted that her  spouse's  level  of  income  should  exceed  the
    requirements, it cannot be properly said that there was  any  error  in
    the judge's approach to Chikwamba.

12. The findings of the judge were open to her and no material error of law
    is disclosed in ground 1.

13. In relation to ground 2, Ms Nizami submitted that the  judge  erred  in
    failing to give weight to the cumulative evidence before  her  and  the
    very significant difficulties that would be faced by the appellant  and
    her partner which could not be overcome and it was submitted  that  the
    judge failed to take into consideration adequately the evidence of  his
    age, his medical condition, his service in the  armed  forces  and  the
    issues he might face in Africa and that he had not resided in  Zimbabwe
    and that it was not realistic that he could gain employment there.   It
    was submitted that the judge did not refer to the country conditions.

14. However, Ms Nizami was unable to point to any evidence that  the  judge
    failed to adequately take into consideration  but  submitted  that  the
    judge should have taken judicial notice of the conditions  in  Zimbabwe
    and submitted that it was one thing that the appellant's sponsor was  a
    69 year old working in the  UK  but  another  to  expect  him  to  take
    employment and relocate to Zimbabwe given the country conditions and in
    the context of a regime that would  be  hostile  to  someone  like  the
    appellant's husband who had worked in the British Army.

15. I do not find any merit in the grounds, which amount to no more than  a
    disagreement with  the  judge's  coherent  and  well-reasoned  findings
    including the finding that there were no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life.  The Tribunal properly directed itself as to  the  correct
    test applicable under  Appendix  FM,  EX.1(b)  in  that  they  are  not
    obstacles that are impossible to surmount  but  concern  the  practical
    possibilities of relocation.  The Tribunal  reminded  itself  that  the
    test is a stringent one.

16. As reflected in the Tribunal's findings, the judge was fully  aware  of
    the situation of both the  appellant  and  her  husband  including  the
    husband's age, his panic disorder and that he had lived and  worked  in
    Africa and did not want to return there.  It is evident, including from
    the judge's recording  of  the  proceedings  at  [4]  to  [12]  of  the
    decision, that the judge was appraised of the situation in Zimbabwe and
    noted the appellant's evidence including of the difficulties that  have
    occurred in Zimbabwe and why she did not want to return there.  Reading
    the decision as a whole, the judge has set her findings in the  context
    of  judicial  knowledge  of  Zimbabwe  as  a  starting  point  but  was
    nevertheless satisfied that there would be no insurmountable  obstacles
    to relocation.  There is no  error  of  law  disclosed  in  the  second
    ground.

17. In relation to ground  3  Ms  Nizami  relied  on  the  Supreme  Court's
    decision in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 and submitted that  the  appellant's
    sponsor exceeds the minimum income requirements and the judge  had  not
    adequately   considered   the   issues   including   in   relation   to
    proportionality, in relation to the sponsor's  age,  medical  condition
    and the other issues and that there had been  inadequate  consideration
    outside of the Rules and that a balance sheet  approach  had  not  been
    applied.  It cannot  be  properly  argued  that  there  was  inadequate
    consideration.  The judge comprehensively considered all  the  material
    factors  cumulatively  when  considering   whether   there   would   be
    insurmountable obstacles.  The fact  that  this  was  not  specifically
    stated as consideration outside of the Rules, is of limited  relevance,
    particularly when this is a case which is only argued  outside  of  the
    Rules in any event and the consideration under the Immigration Rules is
    to the limited extent that Article 8 must be considered from "the  lens
    of the Rules".  I am of the view that when the decision  is  considered
    holistically, the Tribunal applied the balance sheet approach  approved
    by the Supreme Court (see Hesham Ali v Secretary of State [2016] UKSC).



18. The judge gave adequate reasons for finding, including  at  [41],  that
    there was nothing exceptional or compelling about this case.  The judge
    has provided adequate reasons for the conclusions she reached  and  the
    grounds are in reality no more than an argument with the outcome.
