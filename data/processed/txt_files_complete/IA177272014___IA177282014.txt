For the Claimant: Mr W Evans, Legal representative, Templeton Legal
Services


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   For convenience I will refer to the parties as the Secretary  of  State
    who is the appellant in this matter and to Mr Stanley Sunday Onwuje who
    is the main Claimant.  This matter comes before me as an error  of  law
    hearing in which I consider whether or not there was a  material  error
    of law in the First-tier Tribunal such that the outcome of the decision
    would be affected.  At the end of the hearing before me I announced  my
    decision that I found  a  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision.  I now give my reasons.

2.   The Claimant and his wife who is  a  dependant  are  both  citizens  of
    Nigeria. They have two young children born in the UK  on  7.9.2010  and
    5.10.2013. The Claimant first entered the UK in August 2008 with  leave
    to enter as a student.  Further leave was granted as a  Tier  1  (Post-
    Study) Migrant and thereafter as a Tier 4 Student  until  30  September
    2013.  An application for further leave was made outside of  the  Rules
    which was refused on 31 October 2013.  The appeal was  dismissed  at  a
    paper hearing on 7 February 2014.  On 6 March 2014 the Claimant applied
    for leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  (PBS)  scheme.   That
    application was refused by the Secretary of State in a letter dated  25
    March  2014.   She  was  not  satisfied  that  the  Claimant  met   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules under paragraph  245  DD,  namely
    that he was unable to show that he had access to  �200,000  because  he
    did not submit the specified documents and was awarded  no  points  for
    funds.

3.   The First-tier Tribunal (Judge  James)  ("the  Tribunal")  allowed  the
    appeal under Article 8 ECHR in a decision promulgated  on  16  December
    2014.  It was conceded by the Claimant's representative that  he  could
    not satisfy the Tier 1 (Entrepreneurs) rules or  the  Article  8  rules
    under Appendix FM. The hearing proceeded on the basis of Article 8 ECHR
    outside of the Rules.

4.   The Tribunal found that the Claimant's desire to remain in the  UK  was
    based on his family's wish to remain in the UK and for him to  continue
    running his business. It found that although the Claimant had not  been
    able to furnish the specified documents, there  was  evidence  to  show
    that he ran a successful care employment agency in  which  he  invested
    �40,000 and employed 75 people [19 &  20]  and  that  the  company  was
    registered and incorporated on 14.5.2013.  It found that  the  business
    was of such singular benefit to the UK that it warranted  consideration
    outside of the Rules  [30],  and  further  that  the  interference  was
    disproportionate [36].  The Tribunal found that the Claimants had fully
    complied with conditions under their visas and notified  the  Secretary
    of State of any changed circumstances [27].

Grounds of Application

5.   The Secretary of State contends that the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  a
    material misdirection of law by allowing the  appeal  under  Article  8
    ECHR private life. The Tribunal made no reference to moral and physical
    integrity and reliance was placed on the fact that the Claimant  ran  a
    business and its positive  economic  consequences  for  the  UK.   [29]
    Further the  Tribunal  failed  to  take  into  account  paragraph  117B
    Nationality Immigration & Asylum Act  2002  (as  amended)  that  little
    weight should be given to private  life  established  when  a  person's
    immigration status is precarious and the limited use for  private  life
    cases following Nasim and Others  (Article  8)  [2014]  UKUT  0025  IAC
    ("Nasim").

6.   The Tribunal's approach when determining whether there were  compelling
    circumstances in the Claimant's case not recognised by the  Rules,  was
    erroneous and failed to follow (Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)  and  R
    (Nagre) v Home Secretary [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)).

7.   The Tribunal erred in its approach by using  Article  8  to  circumvent
    the Immigration Rules. There would be no interference with family  life
    which could be carried on in Nigeria as opposed to the UK.

8.   The Tribunal failed to consider why it would be unjustifiably harsh  to
    require the claimant to return to Nigeria to make a further application
    and to provide the required documents in order to meet the  Immigration
    Rules.

Permission to Appeal

9.   On renewal before the Upper Tribunal permission to appeal  was  granted
    by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam on 9  September  2015  who  found  it
    arguable that the basis on which the Tribunal  allowed  the  appeal  is
    unclear, purporting to allow the appeal under Article 8 on the basis of
    family life [36], but at [29] it found that return of the family  would
    not breach Article 8.  It is arguable that there was no  engagement  of
    Article 8(1) in this case.

The error of law Hearing

Submissions

10.  Mr  Melvin  relied  on  the  grounds  of  application  and  a  skeleton
    argument. He submitted that  the  findings  were  contradictory  as  to
    whether or not there was family life and whether or not the appeal  was
    allowed on that basis.  The  Tribunal  appeared  to  have  allowed  the
    appeal on the basis of the Claimant's private business interests  which
    did not engage Article 8(1).  It was open to the  Claimant  to  make  a
    further application by providing the specified documents and to  do  so
    did not amount to any unjustifiably harsh  outcome  for  the  Claimant.
    The decision was irrational.  Article 8 was not  a  general  dispensing
    power and the Tribunal had used it as such.  This was contrary  to  the
    approach of the Supreme Court in Patel  and  Others.   Mr  Melvin  also
    relied on RU (Sri Lanka) [2008] EWCA Civ 753 and  UE  (Nigeria)  [2010]
    EWCA Civ  975.   The  Tribunal  had  effectively  used  the  Claimant's
    business as a freestanding factor to tip the scales in his favour.

11.  Mr Evans relied on the Rule 24 response.   It  was  accepted  that  the
    Claimant could not meet the Immigration Rules under Tier 1.  The appeal
    related to both the Claimant and his wife, and Article 8 matters should
    nevertheless be considered under points-based scheme applications.

12.  The main thrust of the claim was the private life  established  through
    business and residence in the  UK  over  the  last  seven  years.   The
    Claimant employed over 100 people and the  business  was  considerable.
    The Tribunal had considered the public  interest  to  the  extent  that
    employees of the business would be put out of work in the event of  the
    Claimant returning to Nigeria.  The Tribunal adopted a  broad  approach
    to Article 8 consistent  with  UE  (Nigeria).   The  Tribunal  properly
    followed the approach  in  Nagre  and  concluded  there  were  relevant
    circumstances  not  covered  by  the  Rules  and  found  it  to  be  an
    exceptional case.

13.   Mr  Melvin  responded  that  the  PBS  Rules  were  premised  on   the
    requirement to have enough finance to start and run  a  business.   The
    fact that the Claimant was running a business was  not  an  exceptional
    factor.  The Tribunal failed to take into account that the Claimant had
    no lawful leave when the business was set up and that he had failed  to
    meet the requirements of the Rules.  This was an irrational decision.

Discussion and Decision

14.  The first ground of appeal contends that the Tribunal's findings as  to
    family life are contradictory and unclear.  In the decision and reasons
    [28] the Tribunal found all  family  members  were  Nigerian  citizens,
    there was a  family  home  in  Nigeria  and  links  and  contacts  were
    maintained with extended family members.  There were no health or other
    problems. At [29] the Tribunal found that a return of the  family  unit
    to Nigeria would not breach family life under Article 8 ECHR.   However
    at [30] the Tribunal found that the right to respect  for  family  life
    was engaged and the  decision  made  by  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    disproportionate.  This amounts to an error of law and this  ground  of
    appeal is made out.

15.  The second ground of appeal contends that the  Tribunal  erred  in  its
    approach to private life in Article 8(1). On reading the decision as  a
    whole it is clear that the Tribunal's main focus under Article 8 was on
    private life rather than family life. The  Secretary  of  State  argues
    that the Tribunal materially erred in concluding that Article 8(1)  was
    engaged through the Claimant's running of a business and  its  economic
    benefit to the UK. I agree with the submissions made by Mr Melvin.  The
    Tribunal failed to follow the approach in "Nasim" [13-21  &  22-24]  in
    which the Upper tribunal endorsed the view taken by the  Supreme  Court
    in Patel and others v SSHD (2013) UKSC  as  to  the  limited  scope  of
    private life and the application of a near miss argument.  The Tribunal
    erred in concluding that the first two questions in Razgar, R  (on  the
    application of) v SSHD [2004]  UKHL  27  were  answered  affirmatively,
    where the Claimant relied on private  life  established  in  precarious
    circumstances  and  the  evidence  related  to  business  and  economic
    matters.  There was no evidence as to  any  private  life  relevant  to
    physical or moral integrity.  The Tribunal found that, "the  profitable
    and successful nature  of  the  first  appellant's  business  (and  its
    positive consequences for patients and staff, as well as the economy of
    the UK by  way  of  income  and  tax  paid),  together  with  the  full
    compliance  of  visa  conditions  and  the  credibility  of  both   the
    appellants,  are  most  persuasive  factors  when  placed  against  the
    formalistic nature of the refusal regarding designated  documents,  and
    the need for an effective immigration  system."  [30]  I  am  satisfied
    therefore that the Tribunal has treated the matter  as  a  "near  miss"
    and/or a general dispensing power for  cases  which  do  not  meet  the
    Rules.

16.  In any event I find that any interference  would  be  proportionate  to
    the legitimate end; namely the operation of a coherent and fair  system
    of immigration control.  The success or failure of a  business  venture
    is not a matter by which the respect for private life  can  be  judged.
    It could be a factor in weighing public interest in the maintenance  of
    immigration control and where the Tribunal would have regard to section
    117 Nationality Immigration & Asylum Act 2002  (as  amended).  In  that
    regard the Tribunal has erred in its failure to  place  weight  on  the
    strong public interest in the legitimate end.

Error of law decision

18.  I find that the decision and reasons discloses a material error of  law
    with regard to Article 8(1) that family and/or private life is engaged.
    I set aside the decision.

Re making

19.  I now go on to remake the decision by dismissing the Claimant's  appeal
    on immigration and on human rights grounds.   The  Claimant  failed  to
    meet the relevant Immigration rules under the PBS  and  in  respect  of
    family and private life. There is  no  justification  to  consider  the
    matter outside of the Rules which  fully  cover  the  circumstances  of
    setting up and running a business. The evidence relied  on  before  the
    Tribunal fails to engage Article 8(1) private life.  It  is  reasonable
    to expect that  the  Claimant  could  make  a  further  application  by
    producing the required specified documents to show that he  had  access
    to the funds, and he could  make  such  an  application  from  Nigeria.
    There is no interference with  family  life.  The  "private  life"  was
    established in precarious circumstances  which  carries  weight  having
    regard to section 117 2002 Act (as amended) and the Claimant  had  made
    no application under the  rules  when  the  business  was  set  up.  In
    assessing the public interest, which is seeking to achieve a  fair  and
    coherent  immigration  system,  any  interference   is   proportionate,
    notwithstanding the positive economic contribution made in  setting  up
    and running the business or the potential impact of its demise.

20.  Decision

    There is a material error of law.

    The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.

    The Claimant's appeal is dismissed under immigration and  human  rights
    grounds.

         No anonymity direction is made.
