This has been a remote hearing to which both parties have consented. The
form of remote hearing was video by Microsoft Teams (V). A face to face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be
determined in a remote hearing. I did not experience any difficulties, and
neither party expressed any concern, with the process.


                                CONSENT ORDER


Background

   1. The respondent conceded that the decision of the First tier Tribunal
      (by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Burnett promulgated on 18 March
      2021) involved the making of an error of law and should be set aside.

   2. The parties were in agreement that the appeal should be remitted to
      the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh with no findings preserved
      by a different judge and that it could be disposed of by consent
      order.



Decision

   3. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
      2008 and by the consent of the parties I make the following order:

   4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal is
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be made afresh by a different
      judge with no findings preserved.
