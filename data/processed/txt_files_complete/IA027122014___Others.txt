For the appellants:    Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are all citizens of India.

 2. These  are  their  appeals  against  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Turquet, promulgated 26.6.14,  dismissing  their  linked
    appeals  against  the  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  dated
    11.12.13, to refuse their applications made on  13.9.13  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur and dependants under the  Points  Based
    System (PBS) of the Immigration Rules, and to remove them from  the  UK
    by way of directions under Section 47 of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 23.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.7.14. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek granted permission  to  appeal
    on 7.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Turquet should be set aside.

 6. In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Kopieczek  considered  it
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in the assessment  of
    whether funds in the second appellant's account were in the control  of
    the first appellant, with reference to paragraph 1A(f) of  Appendix  C,
    "having regard to the fact of this being a joint application and in the
    light of the evidence from the first and second appellants that was put
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. "I have strong reservations about  any  argument  based  on  legitimate
    expectation relating to previous grants of leave.  Similarly,  it  does
    not seem from the original grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
    that article 8 of the ECHR was relied on, and even if it was,  I  again
    have  strong  reservations  about  whether  any   such   ground   could
    independently have succeeded. Nevertheless, I do not rule  out  any  of
    the grounds in this grant of permission."

 8. Judge Kopieczek gave directions that no later than 7  days  before  the
    Upper Tribunal appeal hearing the appellants were to file and  serve  a
    complete copy of any policy guidance relied on together with a skeleton
    argument including a detailed explanation of, "the  funds  required  by
    the appellants in terms of maintenance, and how it is  said  that  that
    requirement is met in terms of the monies held in the relevant account,
    and with reference to the immigration rules that applied at the date of
    the application and decision."

 9. Not only did the appellants fail to comply with  these  directions,  in
    that no such document or skeleton argument  has  been  filed  with  the
    Tribunal, but neither any appellant nor any representative attended the
    appeal hearing before me on 13.11.14, for which notice was sent out  on
    20.10.14 to the home address at 38 Selkirk Road, London SW17  OES,  the
    same address that appears in the application for permission  to  appeal
    filed with the Tribunal in July 2014. In accordance with Rule 38 of the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  as  amended,  I  am
    satisfied  that  reasonable  steps  have  been  taken  to  notify   the
    appellants of the hearing listed before me and that in absence  of  any
    explanation  for  the   non-attendance   of   the   appellants   or   a
    representative, I conclude that it is in the interests  of  justice  to
    proceed with the hearing.

10. In my view, the grant of permission misunderstands the  nature  of  the
    application. This was not a joint Tier 1 entrepreneur application,  but
    rather a Tier 1 entrepreneur application by the first  appellant,  with
    his wife and child as dependants, not entrepreneurs.

11. Paragraph 1A(f)  of  Appendix  C  requires  the  Tier  1  applicant  to
    demonstrate that the (maintenance) funds were "under his own control on
    the  date  of  the  application  and  for  the  period  specified,"  (a
    consecutive 90 days). These maintenance funds are in  addition  to  the
    �50,000 investment fund.

12. The first appellant has to be able to demonstrate that he, not  someone
    else, can adequately maintain himself and his dependants.  To  do  that
    the Rules require a certain minimum level of  maintenance  funds  which
    must be held under his control. Whilst the evidence was that the second
    appellant, the dependant wife of the first  appellant,  had  sufficient
    funds (�2,700) in her own Halifax account for the period  of  3  months
    prior to the date of application, those funds were  under  her  control
    and not that of the first appellant.

13. The appellants' case was that  the  funds  in  the  second  appellant's
    account were de facto under  his  control  and  that  he  used  it  for
    savings. It was said that he had  the  password  for  the  account  and
    sometimes paid money into it. At �14 the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
    find it credible that the first appellant  would  put  money  into  his
    wife's account rather than keeping it in his own account or  opening  a
    separate business account.

14. Irrespective of that finding, the requirement is that the funds must be
    under the first appellant's own control. By way of logical  comparison,
    provision is made for joint-entrepreneur applications, but in such case
    the bank account has to be in the names of both applicants. It makes no
    sense that an application by one prospective  entrepreneur,  even  with
    dependants, should have a less strict requirement and permit  necessary
    funds to held in the name of another. Further, and more  significantly,
    paragraph 1B(iii)(1) specifically requires  that  the  statements  must
    show, inter alia, the name of the applicant. These  statements  do  not
    show his name and thus cannot meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules.

15. The grounds of application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal raise article 8 ECHR. However, that was not a ground of appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal and was evidently not raised at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal appeal hearing. In Sarkar v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 195, the Court of Appeal stated:

         "Finally, I think it is important to bear in mind that  this  court
         will allow an appeal against a decision of the Upper Tribunal  only
         if it is satisfied that it involved a material error  of  law.  The
         most that can be said of the decision in the present case  is  that
         the Tribunal failed to  consider  the  merits  of  the  appellants'
         article 8 claim. However, there was no evidence before the Tribunal
         capable of support the findings of fact necessary to  enable  their
         argument to succeed. I find it difficult to see, therefore, how  it
         can be said that any such error was material since, if the Tribunal
         had considered that ground of appeal, it would have been  bound  to
         reject it."

16. The grounds of application for permission to appeal state only  in  the
    most cursory of terms that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred  in
    failing to consider the appellants' case under article 8 ECHR  in  line
    with CDS (Brazil) [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC). The grounds assert that this
    is a case "where the private  life  deserves  respect  and  the  public
    interest in removal is diminished especially since there  has  been  no
    prior issues and the basis of refusal falls on a technicality."  It  is
    further said that the appellant has already expended his own savings on
    the business.

17. However, CDS (Brazil), now somewhat dated, has been followed by a  line
    of other and more recent cases pointing out that article 8 has  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity. In  the  circumstances
    the relevance of CD (Brazil) to the present case is rather limited.

18. In Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC) it was stated, "it
    is important to emphasise that the appellant in CDS (Brazil) was  faced
    with a hypothetical  removal,  which  would  have  prevented  her  from
    completing the course of study for which she had been given leave." The
    panel pointed out that, "the essential elements  of  the  private  life
    relied on will normally be transposable, in the sense of being  capable
    of replication in their essential respects, following a person's return
    to their home country."

19. The first appellant has no legitimate  expectation  of  being  able  to
    remain in the UK except and only in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules for doing so. He has failed to  demonstrate  that  he  meets  the
    Rules  and  that  is  a  very  significant   factor   in   any   Razgar
    proportionality balancing exercise between on the one hand the  private
    life rights of the appellants and  on  the  other  the  legitimate  and
    necessary aim of the state to protect the economic well-being of the UK
    through immigration control. The family life will be able  to  continue
    uninterrupted in India and such associations and  friendships  as  they
    may  have  developed  in  the  UK  can  be  maintained  through  modern
    communications from India and perhaps occasional visits. After all that
    is the sort of relationship many families now have  with  their  family
    members as children and siblings take advantage of mobility to relocate
    across the  world.  There  is  nothing  in  the  circumstances  of  the
    appellants that one  could  describe  as  sufficiently  compelling  and
    insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules so  as  to  justify,
    exceptionally, permitting leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules  under
    article 8 private life on the basis that the decision would  produce  a
    result that was disproportionate or otherwise unjustifiably harsh.

20. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the appellants can  raise
    article 8 at this stage, where it was not raised  or  addressed  before
    the First-tier Tribunal they can be taken to have  abandoned  it  as  a
    ground of appellant. However, even if article  8  is  engaged  in  this
    case, which I do not accept that it is, for the reasons set out above I
    find  that  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is   entirely
    proportionate and not disproportionate to the appellants' rights  under
    article 8 ECHR.

Conclusion & Decision

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of  each  appellant  remains  dismissed  on  both
                    immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
