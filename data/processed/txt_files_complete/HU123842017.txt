                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals from the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Veloso) dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent ("the Department") made on 2 October 2017 to refuse to grant
    him indefinite leave to remain under the Rules  as  a  person  who  has
    accrued at least 10 years' continuous lawful residence.  The First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that such a direction is warranted for these proceedings in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Relevant Background Facts

 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose  date  of  birth  is  30
    August 1974.  He first entered the UK on 12 July 2006 with valid  entry
    clearance as a student.  The appellant extended his stay in the  UK  in
    various capacities thereafter.  On 13 March 2009 he was  granted  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-study work) migrant until  13  March  2011.
    His wife joined him in the UK as his dependant on 5 April 2010, and  on
    4 October 2010 the appellant and his wife returned from  Pakistan  with
    their three children, and all of them entered the UK with valid leave.

 3. On 12 March 2011 the appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (General) migrant claiming  that  he  had  accrued  total  earnings  of
    �66,564 in the year from 1 March 2010 to 28 February  2011.   His  wife
    and their three children applied in line as his dependants.  On 16 June
    2011 the respondent granted the appellant and his dependants  leave  to
    remain until 16 June 2013.

 4. The appellant applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)
    migrant on 15 June 2013, claiming total earnings of �66,148 in the year
    from 1 June 2012 to 31 May 2013.  On 10 September 2013  the  respondent
    granted the appellant leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (General)  migrant
    until 10 September 2016, and  his  dependants  were  granted  leave  to
    remain in line with him.

 5. On 30 August 2016 the appellant applied for indefinite leave to  remain
    on the grounds of continuous lawful residence of  at  least  10  years.
    His wife and three children applied for indefinite leave to  remain  as
    his dependants.

 6. On 2 October 2017 the Department gave their reasons  for  refusing  the
    appellant's application.  The Department invoked  paragraph  322(5)  of
    the Rules, which provides that  leave  to  remain  should  normally  be
    refused where it is undesirable  to  permit  the  person  concerned  to
    remain in the UK in light of his conduct, character or associations, or
    the fact that he represents a threat to national security.

 7. The evidential foundation for the  invocation  of  Rule  322(5)  was  a
    comparison between the information which the appellant had given in his
    applications of 12 March 2011 and 15 June 2013,  with  the  information
    that the Department had obtained from HMRC.  The Department  said  that
    it had verified the appellant's earnings "during this period" with HMRC
    who confirmed the following details: (a) for the tax year 6 April  2010
    to 5 April 2011, the appellant had declared earnings (total income)  of
    �23,356, the source of this income being from PAYE employment and self-
    employment; (b) for the tax year 6 April 2011 to 5  April  2012,  there
    was no trace of any self-employment income being declared; (c) for  the
    tax year 6 April 2012 to 5  April  2013,  the  appellant  had  declared
    earnings (total income) of �27,372, the source  of  this  income  being
    from PAYE employment and self-employment; and (d) for the  tax  year  6
    April 2013 to 5 April 2014, the appellant had declared earnings  (total
    income)  of  �20,900,  the  source  of  this  income  being  from  PAYE
    employment and self-employment.

 8. The Department said that it  was  evident  that  HMRC  records  of  the
    appellant's income differed significantly to the income  which  he  had
    declared to UK Visas & Immigration in his two applications.  If he  had
    declared his (true) level of income to UKVI  as  part  of  his  Tier  1
    applications, he would not have been awarded the required points to  be
    given leave to remain.  Accordingly, the Department considered that  it
    would be undesirable for him to remain in the UK in the  light  of  his
    character and conduct.   The  Department  was  satisfied  that  he  had
    misrepresented his earnings  at  various  times  for  the  purposes  of
    reducing his tax liability or for the purpose  of  obtaining  leave  to
    remain or both.

 9. The Department acknowledged that Rule 322(5) of the  Rules  was  not  a
    mandatory  refusal.   However,   the   evidence   submitted   did   not
    satisfactorily demonstrate that the failure to declare to HMRC  at  the
    time the  PAYE  and  self-employed  earnings  claimed  in  his  Tier  1
    applications were "genuine errors."

10. The grounds of appeal were settled by  legal  representatives  who  the
    appellant had instructed.  In  the  notice  of  appeal,  the  appellant
    elected for an oral hearing which was going to be attended by  himself,
    his legal representative, and witnesses.  In Part 3 of  the  notice  of
    appeal, he was asked to explain why the decision to  refuse  his  human
    rights claim was unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
     His representatives pleaded that the appellant had minor children  who
    had been living in the UK for 7 years, and the appellant was  going  to
    rely on EX.1.  The appellant had never deceived UK Visas & Immigration,
    and had never been a burden on the UK taxpayers.  The discretion in the
    Immigration Rules should have been exercised differently.

11. The appellant then changed his mind about having an oral hearing.  On 1
    November 2017 the Tribunal was notified that the appellant  wished  for
    his appeal to be disposed of without a hearing.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

12. In his decision promulgated on 13 December 2017, Judge Veloso  set  out
    the documentary evidence that was before him at paragraph [3].

13. It is apparent from his summary that the appellant had  not  filed  any
    evidence in support of his appeal, including any  evidence  to  support
    his bare denial in the grounds of appeal that he had deceived UKVI when
    applying for leave to remain in 2011 and 2013.  Equally, it is apparent
    that the respondent had failed to comply  with  a  direction  from  the
    Tribunal to serve on the Tribunal and on the appellant any  unpublished
    documents on which the Department wished to rely.   Accordingly,  there
    was no letter or witness statement from HMRC confirming what  had  been
    said in the refusal decision about  the  contents  of  the  appellant's
    applications and tax returns.

14. The Judge set out his findings on Rule 322(5) at paragraphs  [19]-[25].
    The burden of proof was on the respondent to show dishonesty.  The Home
    Office bundle did not include a copy of  the  appellant's  applications
    for leave to remain showing  the  total  earnings  claimed  during  the
    relevant periods,  or  any  correspondence  from  HMRC  confirming  the
    amounts that were at odds with those in the application forms.  So,  he
    found on balance that the respondent failed to show that the  appellant
    came within Rule 322(5).  He observed that the respondent did not  take
    issue with the appellant having totalled  at  least  10  years'  lawful
    leave in the UK as at the date of application. He  also  observed  that
    having found against him on Rule 322(5), the respondent had refused the
    appellant under Rule 276B(ii)(c) and (iii).  He had regard to the  fact
    that "not in accordance with the law" was not an  available  ground  of
    appeal in this case.  He observed that the  appellant's  appeal  bundle
    did not contain a witness statement from the appellant,  and  that  the
    skeleton argument did not contain any detail  about  his  circumstances
    "such that a finding can be made  that  paragraph  276B  was  bound  to
    succeed."  The skeleton argument in the bundle did not argue  paragraph
    276B, but instead focused solely on Appendix FM and the length of  time
    that the appellant's children had been in the UK.

15. The  Judge  went  on  to  address  a  private  life  claim  under  Rule
    276ADE(1)(vi) at paragraphs [27]-[30].  He found that there  would  not
    be very significant obstacles to  the  appellant's  reintegration  into
    life and society in Pakistan.

16. At paragraphs [31]-[44], the Judge gave his reasons  for  finding  that
    the appellant did not succeed in an Article 8 claim outside the  Rules.
    In particular, with regard to section 117B(6), he found that on balance
    the appellant had not shown that it would not be reasonable  to  expect
    his children to leave the UK.

The Reasons for the Initial Refusal of Permission to  Appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal

17. The  appellant's  legal  representatives  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  Permission to  appeal  was
    initially refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert  who  held  that
    the pleaded grounds took issue with the findings made by the  Judge  on
    the evidence, but in effect amounted to no more than disagreement  with
    those findings and an attempt to re-argue the appellant's case.

The Reasons for the Eventual Grant of Permission  to  Appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal

18. In a renewed application for permission  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the
    appellant's representatives re-cast their grounds.

19. Ground 1 was that the Judge had erred in law in  his  consideration  of
    Rule 276B, given that he had found that the respondent  had  failed  to
    show that the appellant came within Rule 322(5).

20.  Ground  2  was  that  the  Judge  had  erred  in  his  assessment   of
    proportionality, given his finding at paragraph [41] that a key  factor
    in assessing proportionality was the appellant's personal  credibility,
    which the Judge had found to be in his favour, and his finding that the
    respondent had not shown that he came within paragraph 322(5) or failed
    under the suitability requirement.

21. Ground 3 was that the Judge had erred in his application of the  7-year
    Rule.

22. Ground 4 was that the Judge had erred in finding  that  there  were  no
    significant obstacles to the  appellant's  integrating  into  Pakistan,
    despite  the  fact  that  the  appellant's  children  had  spent  their
    formative years in the UK  and  had  fully  integrated  within  the  UK
    society, retaining minimal ties to their country of origin.

The Reasons for the Eventual Grant of Permission to Appeal

23. On 14 September 2018, Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins  granted  permission
    to appeal for the following reasons: "I give permission on each  ground
    but I am particularly concerned the First-tier Tribunal Judge  may  not
    have had lawful regard to the rights of the appellant's three children,
    each of whom have been in the United Kingdom for more than 7 years (see
    ... MT & ET (Child's best interests; extempore  pilot)  Nigeria  [2018]
    UKUT 88 (IAC)."

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law on Ground 1 only

24. Ground 4 has no merit. It is no more than an expression of disagreement
    with a finding that was reasonably open to the Judge  on  the  evidence
    that was before him.

25. Ground 2 effectively buttresses Ground 3, which is the ground of appeal
    specifically identified by Judge Perkins  as  having  particular  prima
    facie merit.

26. On the law as it was understood when the Tribunal promulgated MT &  ET,
    it is strongly arguable that the Judge  may  not  have  had  sufficient
    regard to the strength of the private life claims  of  the  appellant's
    three children - in particular the two oldest children, who had by  the
    time of the hearing accrued over seven years' residence in the UK  from
    the age of four.  However, the  reasonableness  question  must  now  be
    considered through the lens of a real world assessment,  following  the
    decision of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) & Others -v- Secretary of
    State for the Home  Department  [2018]  UKSC  53.   Having  found  that
    neither parent had an independent right to remain in the UK, I consider
    that it was open to the Judge to find that it would  be  reasonable  to
    expect all the children to accompany their parents back to Pakistan.

27. I am much more troubled by Ground 1.  Although this ground has not been
    satisfactorily pleaded, there is an obvious  difficulty  in  the  Judge
    finding that the respondent had not discharged the burden of proof with
    regard to the invocation of Rule 322(5) and the corresponding provision
    in Rule 276B(ii), but at the same time holding that the  appellant  had
    not shown that he met all the relevant requirements for  the  grant  of
    ILR under Rule 276B.

28. I consider that it was open to the Judge to find that the appellant had
    not discharged the burden of proving that he qualified  for  ILR  under
    Rule 276B, but not for the reason which the Judge gave.

29. It would have been open to the Judge to find that  the  respondent  had
    discharged the burden of proving that the appellant did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Rule 276B(ii), in the  particular  circumstances  which
    were as follows:

          a) the refusal letter contained very detailed  information  about
             the declarations made by the appellant  in  his  applications,
             and also the declarations which he had made to  HMRC,  and  so
             there was hearsay evidence  inherent  in  the  refusal  letter
             which was prima facie worthy of belief;

          b) the appellant had completed a detailed questionnaire about his
             earnings from self-employment and about  his  declarations  to
             HMRC for  the  purposes  of  his  ILR  application,  and  this
             document was included in the Home Office  bundle  and  so  the
             appellant's "admissions" as to what he had  declared  to  HMRC
             could be compared with  the  evidence  cited  in  the  refusal
             decision;

          c) the information given in the refusal decision all  related  to
             the contents of documents which  had  been  generated  by  the
             appellant (with the assistance of his accountants), and so all
             the information was within his knowledge;

          d) the appellant  had  not  disputed  the  underlying  facts  (in
             particular, the quoted figures) in his grounds of appeal or in
             any evidence tendered in support of the appeal;

          e) the appellant had only disputed the  asserted  consequence  of
             different figures being given to HMRC as against  UKVI,  which
             was alleged deception of UKVI;

          f) the appellant had not disputed in his grounds  of  appeal  the
             (alternative) asserted consequence  of  alleged  deception  of
             HMRC.

30. This is not a case where the  Department  was  relying  on  a  document
    verification report to assert that a document provided by the appellant
    was false.  Clearly, in  such  circumstances,  the  Department  has  to
    provide  a  document  verification  report  in  order  to  support  the
    allegation  of  forgery.   The  Department  was   relying   solely   on
    discrepancies between information given by the appellant to the UKVI as
    against information given by the appellant to HMRC.  The Department was
    not trying to prove that the  information  given  in  either  case  was
    false. The Department was simply relying on  the  fact  that  different
    information was given to UKVI than was given to HMRC.

31. As the Judge later noted  in  his  decision,  the  respondent's  bundle
    contained a  questionnaire  which  the  appellant  had  been  asked  to
    complete for the purposes of the consideration of his  application  for
    ILR.  The Questionnaire begins at B2 of the Home Office bundle, and  it
    is expressly stated to  relate  to  the  appellant's  previous  Tier  1
    (General)  leave.   The  appellant  was  asked  a  series  of  detailed
    questions about financial years for which he was  registered  as  self-
    employed, or was a  director  of  a  limited  company.   The  appellant
    provided a schedule at B8 showing that his net profit in the  tax  year
    ending 2011 was �3,658 and his gross profit was �9,562; that he did not
    trade at all in the tax year ending April 2012; and  that  in  the  tax
    year ending 2013, his gross profit was �38,813 whereas his  net  profit
    was �8,600.

32. Having regard to the evidence which he did have,  it  would  have  been
    open to the Judge to find that the respondent had raised a prima  facie
    case  of  deception/misrepresentation  as  asserted  in   the   refusal
    decision, and that the evidential burden had shifted to  the  appellant
    to provide an innocent explanation, which had not been forthcoming.

33. The Judge clearly recognised that the  absence  of  evidence  from  the
    appellant directed to Rule 322(5) and Rule 276B  was  problematic,  and
    hence he declined to find in the appellant's favour  under  Rule  276B.
    But I do not consider that the reason which he gives for  so  doing  is
    sustainable.  The only issue raised by the Department under  Rule  276B
    was  the  issue  of  the  appellant  providing   seriously   discrepant
    information to UKVI as against what had been declared  to  HMRC.   This
    was the only basis on  which  it  was  asserted  that  the  appellant's
    continued presence in the UK was undesirable.  So, having found in  his
    favour on this issue, logically no  additional  evidence  was  required
    from the appellant to show that he qualified for ILR under Rule 276B.

34. Mr Clarke submits that the decision is defensible on  the  ground  that
    the appellant failed to show  that  the  discretion  inherent  in  Rule
    276B(ii)  was  exercised  unlawfully  or  should  have  been  exercised
    differently. But it is not open to me  to  dismiss  the  error  of  law
    challenge on the ground that the Judge got the right result, but for  a
    different and opposing reason than the one he gave.

35. The upshot is that the Judge did not give adequate reasons for  finding
    that the appellant did not qualify for ILR under 276B in  circumstances
    where he simultaneously held that the respondent  had  not  shown  that
    discretion should be exercised against the appellant under Rule 322(5);
    and hence, by necessary implication, under Rule 276B(ii).

36. The consequence of this is that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    is vitiated by a material error of law such that it must be  set  aside
    and remade.

The Resumed Hearing on 15 January 2019

37. At the outset  of  the  resumed  hearing  to  remake  the  decision,  I
    established that neither party had served any evidence pursuant  to  my
    directions.   I  discussed  the   implications   of   this   with   the
    representatives.  I indicated to Mr Shah that it was  open  to  him  to
    apply for an adjournment.  Mr Shah declined to do so.  He  informed  me
    that the appellant was content to proceed on the  documentary  evidence
    as it stood.

38. Mr Shah called the appellant as  a  witness  to  explain  the  apparent
    discrepancies in the figures given in the  refusal  letter,  which  the
    appellant accepted were accurate.  In his evidence in  chief,  he  said
    that the apparent discrepancies arose from "accounting differences".

39. The appellant  was  cross-examined  by  Ms  Everett,  and  he  answered
    questions for clarification purposes from me.  He explained that during
    the relevant period, he had had PAYE employment as a Meter Reader;  and
    that he had had two sources of self-employment.  One was as a  Personal
    Trainer, and the other was as an Online Forex Trader.

40. He had paid the correct tax to HMRC.  The differences  in  the  figures
    declared to UKVI as  against  declared  those  to  HMRC  arose  from  a
    combination of factors: the different accounting periods; and the  fact
    that he had sustained huge losses as a Forex Trader  in  the  tax  year
    ending April 2012.  It was that reason that no self-employed income had
    been declared to HMRC in that year.  He said that he had explained  the
    differences when  completing  the  Questionnaire.   There  was  no  re-
    examination.

41. In her closing submissions on behalf  of  the  Department,  Ms  Everett
    reiterated the case that she had put to the appellant, which  was  that
    he had not given a credible explanation for the  discrepancies  in  the
    figures, and accordingly the case under Rule 322(5) was made  out.   In
    reply, Mr Shah submitted that in  the  answers  he  had  given  to  the
    Questionnaire the appellant had provided a satisfactory explanation for
    the apparent discrepancies in the figures, and he invited  me  to  find
    that the appellant had presented as a  truthful  witness  who  had  not
    tried to hide anything.

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

42. The appellant accepts that for the purposes of his Tier  1  application
    of 12 March 2011, he claimed to have an  income  of  �66,564  from  all
    sources between 1 March 2010 and 28 February  2011.   This  figure  for
    income comprised �20,780 from PAYE employment and  �45,784  from  self-
    employment.  On that basis, he was awarded 40 points under the previous
    earnings category.

43. As noted earlier in this decision, in answer to  the  Questionnaire  at
    section B of the Home Office bundle, the appellant provided a  Schedule
    at B8 showing that his net profit in  the  tax  year  ending  2011  was
    �3,658 and his gross profit was �9,562.

44. The appellant's net profit represented his taxable  income  from  self-
    employment; and accordingly, the information given in the Questionnaire
    is broadly in line with the appellant's tax return for the year  ending
    5 April 2011, where he declared a total income of �23,356,  the  source
    of his  income  being  a  combination  of  PAYE  employment  and  self-
    employment.

45. The accounting period for the Tier 1 application is almost the same  as
    the accounting period for the tax return for the year to 5 April  2011.
    The fact that the accounting period for the Tier 1 application ended on
    28 February 2011, not 5 April 2011, does not reasonably account for the
    massive discrepancy between the figures for net profit and gross profit
    declared to HMRC and the income from self-employment of  �45,784  which
    is claimed in the Tier 1 application.  Even if the  figure  of  �45,784
    represents gross profit, rather than net  taxable  profit,  it  is  not
    credible that the appellant generated a gross profit of some �9,000  in
    the 11 months between 5 April 2011 and 28  February  2011,  whereas  he
    generated a gross profit of some �36,000 in the period 1 March 2011  to
    5 April 2011.

46. I am not  directly  concerned  with  the  next  tax  year,  but  it  is
    noteworthy that the appellant has given conflicting accounts as to  the
    reason why no self-employment income was declared to HMRC for  the  tax
    year ending 5 April 2012.  His explanation in  his  oral  evidence  was
    that this was because he had made massive losses in that year.  But  in
    his Questionnaire, his explanation was that he was not trading.

47. The appellant accepts that for his leave to remain  application  of  15
    June 2013, he claimed to have  a  total  income  of  �56,148  from  all
    sources of employment between 1 June 2012 to 31  May  2013,  comprising
    just  over  �19,000  from  PAYE  employment  and  �47,056  from   self-
    employment.  This figure presents as hugely inflated when  compared  to
    the declarations made by the appellant to HMRC for the tax years ending
    April 2013 and April 2014.  The combined total income for the two years
    taken together that was declared to HMRC, including  income  from  PAYE
    employment, was just over �47,000.

48. The figure also presents  as  hugely  inflated  when  compared  to  the
    figures for net profit given in the Schedule at B8.  The appellant said
    that his net profit from self-employment in the year to April 2013  was
    �8,600, and in the tax year to April 2014 was �876.

49. I accept that the gross profit for the tax year to April 2013 was  said
    to be �38,813, and that for the tax year to April 2014 the gross profit
    was said to be �15,000.  However, as the  appellant  indicated  in  the
    course of his oral evidence, these gross profit figures are in  reality
    figures for turnover. This is reflected in the fact that the reason for
    the massive difference between the gross profit  figures  and  the  net
    profit figures is the allocation of expenses: the costs incurred by the
    appellant in generating turnover.  The net profit figures  reflect  the
    income which the appellant will have taken out of  his  business.   For
    the purposes of the Tier 1 application, it was his personal income from
    self-employment, not his turnover, which was determinative of his  true
    level of previous earnings, as he would have known full well.

50. The case advanced  in  the  refusal  decision  is  that  the  appellant
    knowingly misrepresented his earnings at various times, either for  the
    purpose of reducing his tax liability or for the purpose  of  obtaining
    leave to remain, or both.  I accept the appellant's  evidence  that  he
    declared his full earnings to HMRC, and that he  did  not  misrepresent
    his earnings to HMRC for the purposes of reducing  his  tax  liability.
    But the corollary of this is that the Department has established on the
    balance of probabilities that  the  appellant  knowingly  inflated  his
    earnings from self-employment in his Tier 1 applications  in  order  to
    obtain the points he required to qualify for leave to remain in the  UK
    as a Tier 1 (General) migrant.

51. Accordingly, the general  ground  of  refusal  is  made  out,  and  the
    appellant does not qualify for the grant of indefinite leave to  remain
    under Rule 276B as he does not  meet  the  requirements  of  Rule  276B
    (iii).

52. With regard to an alternative claim on Article 8  grounds  outside  the
    Rules, there is no reason to depart from the  sustainable  findings  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  that  the   threatened   interference
    consequential  upon  the  refusal  decision  is  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate public end sought to be achieved, namely the maintenance  of
    firm and effective immigration controls.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
