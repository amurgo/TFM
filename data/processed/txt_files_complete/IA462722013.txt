                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I will refer to
       the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of the  Philippines  born  on  5th  March
       1978. He arrived in the UK on 27th August  2012  as  a  student.  He
       applied for further leave to remain as the carer of his grandmother.
       This application was refused on 22nd October 2013, and he  appealed.
       His appeal against this decision was allowed under Article 8 ECHR by
       First-tier Tribunal Judge IA Lewis in a determination promulgated on
       the 3rd June 2014.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Cruthers on 14th July 2014 who said that: "I suspect that  there  is
       little substance in at least some of  the  complaints  made  in  the
       grounds. Contrary to paragraph 2 of the grounds, for  instance,  the
       determination  under  consideration  is  peppered  throughout   with
       references to the "new article 8 rules" brought into effect from 9th
       July 2012." However permission was granted on the basis that it  was
       arguable that the First-tier judge had  erred  in  allowing  on  the
       basis of Article 8 ECHR outside of the Immigration Rules.

    4. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions

    5. Mr Nath relied upon  the  grounds  of  appeal.  These  contended  as
       follows: that consideration  had  not  been  given  to  whether  the
       appellant could succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to
       Article 8 ECHR; that the Tribunal  had  not  identified  "compelling
       circumstances" as required by Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -
       correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 to embark on a consideration  of
       Article 8 ECHR outside of the Immigration Rules  and  then  had  not
       identified why the refusal of leave would be "unjustifiably  harsh";
       further the Tribunal had not identified why the appellant could  not
       follow the normal route regarding obtaining entry clearance to  join
       his fianc�e in the UK or why a carer could not be employed  for  his
       grandmother. I asked Mr Nath to  point  to  the  paragraphs  in  his
       determination where Judge IA Lewis made legal errors  but  he  could
       not do so.

    6. I told Mr Burrett that I did not need to trouble him for submissions
       as I was  satisfied  that  there  were  no  errors  of  law  in  the
       determination of Judge IA Lewis which I found  was  written  to  the
       highest standards of legal correctness.

Conclusions

    7. As noted by Judge Cruthers, Judge IA Lewis correctly  considers  the
       appeal firstly under the Immigration Rules  relating  to  Article  8
       ECHR and then goes on to consider the matter under the  general  law
       relating to Article 8 ECHR. His  findings  and  conclusions  section
       runs to 14 pages of clear and  concise  argument  dealing  with  all
       factual issues raised.

    8. Judge IA Lewis guides himself correctly with  reference  to  Gulshan
       from  paragraph  14  of  his  determination  when  he   starts   his
       consideration of whether  he  needs  to  look  at  the  matter  with
       reference to Article 8 ECHR outside of  the  Immigration  Rules.  He
       concludes by giving cogent reasons as to why consideration should be
       given in this way at paragraph 30 because  of  the  accumulation  of
       issues in this case.

    9. Judge IA Lewis agrees that  if  it  were  simply  a  matter  of  the
       relationship between the appellant  and  his  fianc�e,  despite  the
       positive findings he makes about their relationship and their actual
       financial situation, that given they  cannot  meet  the  Immigration
       Rules or show that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  their
       family life continuing outside of the UK,  that  the  appeal  cannot
       succeed on this basis (see paragraph 28 of the determination).

   10. However Judge Lewis finds that it would have unjustifiably harsh  to
       require the appellant to leave principally because of the  care  and
       support  provided  by  the  appellant  and  his   fianc�e   to   his
       grandmother. He identifies this relationship as being one of "family
       life" given the degree of dependency between the appellant  and  his
       grandmother (see paragraph 40). At paragraph 39 he considers whether
       this might be provided by an alternative carer (Social Services) but
       concludes that this is not simply a matter of high  level  practical
       support but is : "a very high  level  of  emotional  support  to  an
       elderly lady perceiving her physical condition  to  be  degenerating
       and anxious about plainly unsettling and frightening symptoms of her
       lung disease."

   11. I find no legal errors in the determination of Judge Lewis.

Decision

   12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making
       of an error on a point of law.

   13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  appeal  under
       Article 8 of the ECHR is upheld.
