Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms S Haji, counsel (instructed by S Z Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant, a national of Pakistan, appeals with permission against
      the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge D Ross,  promulgated  on  21
      March 2016 dismissing his appeal to remain as the partner of a British
      citizen.


   2. The appellant's application for leave to remain as  the  spouse  of  a
      refugee was refused  by  the  respondent  on  15  October  2014.   His
      subsequent appeal was dismissed on 20 February 2015.


   3. He then applied on 27 March 2015 for leave to remain as the partner of
      a British citizen.  His application was refused on 19  May  2015.   It
      was not accepted that the appellant and his wife were in a  subsisting
      relationship. They had not submitted sufficient material in support of
      that claim.  The  appellant  also  failed  to  provide  the  specified
      evidence required in respect of gross income of �18,600.


   4. Judge Ross noted that the appellant claimed  that  he  first  met  the
      appellant on '31 June 2013' (sic) and that the relationship began on 5
      January 2014. They were married on 25 July 2014.  His  partner  earned
      �15,560 in the last year - [2].


   5. He was served with a copy of the decision of  Judge  Gribble  dated  3
      February 2015. In that appeal it was accepted by the  respondent  that
      the appellant had a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  his
      British partner. That was also accepted by Judge Gribble - [6].


   6. The appellant stated in evidence before Judge Ross that he lived  with
      his wife, Saira Mughal, a British national. He came to  the  UK  as  a
      student and met her on '31 June 2013'. They married in July 2014.  The
      appellant pointed out that although dismissing his earlier appeal  the
      Judge accepted that his marriage was genuine and subsisting.  He  also
      contended that his wife had produced bank accounts showing  an  income
      in excess of �18,600 as well as a tax return that  showed  her  income
      was �19,200. She had recently started employment on a salary in excess
      of �18,600 - [9].


   7. Judge Ross did not accept that the  financial  requirements  had  been
      met. There was not amongst  the  documents  submitted,  the  specified
      evidence showing that she and her husband earned in excess of  �18,600
      in the year ended 5 April 2014 - [15].


   8. Consideration was also given as to whether the appellant could succeed
      under  Section  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  and  whether  there  would  be
      insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  outside  the  UK.
      Judge Ross did not consider that the appellant could not enjoy  family
      life in Pakistan without serious hardship.  The  appellant  had  spent
      most of his life in Pakistan.  The appellant had made  no  submissions
      in his statement that there would be any particular difficulty in  his
      returning there. He appreciated that the appellant's wife is a British
      citizen, but her passport showed she was born in Lahore and she has  a
      connection to Pakistan [17].


   9. He dismissed the appeal under the Rules.


  10. He also considered the appeal under Article 8.  He  did  not  consider
      that it would be  unreasonable  or  disproportionate  to  require  the
      applicant to satisfy the conditions at the  time  of  application.  He
      directed himself in accordance with SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ  387.  He
      did not consider that the facts in this case placed the  appellant  in
      an exceptional category.


  11.  He  nevertheless  considered  whether  the  decision  constituted   a
      disproportionate interference with  his  family  or  private  life  in
      accordance with Razgar. Although he and his  wife  are  engaged  in  a
      genuine relationship, that  was  not  sufficient  to  enable  them  to
      succeed on the basis of family life - [20].


  12. The respondent is entitled to impose stringent  conditions  applicable
      to everybody relating to the minimum level of accessible income.  This
      is reinforced by s.117B which requires that there should be  financial
      independence.   Evidence  relating  to  the   satisfaction   of   that
      requirement post-dated the date of decision and had not been submitted
      with the application. There were no children who  would  be  affected,
      nor were there any health issues. He found the  respondent's  decision
      to be proportionate [20].


  13. On 19  September  2016,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal on the basis that it is  arguable  that
      in determining whether there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
      life in Pakistan for the couple (paragraphs [17-18]), the Judge failed
      to take into account the sponsor's refugee status referred to  at  [1]
      of the determination.


  14. Ms Haji submitted that the Judge referred to the sponsor as a refugee.
      She was granted refugee status as she was  unable  to  travel  to  the
      country against which they were granted such status. Finding that  the
      appellant and the sponsor could live in Pakistan without hardship, was
      an error. They could not live in Pakistan without hardship.


  15. Mr Staunton relied on the rule 24 response. According to  Home  Office
      records, the sponsor, Saira Mughal, was granted ILR in 2008, but  this
      does not appear to be a grant of refugee status, rather it was a grant
      of leave under the legacy policy.


      Assessment


  16. Ms Haji informed stated that NASS support had been granted as  of  the
      date of decision.


  17. I have had regard to the witness  statement  of  Saira  Mughal  placed
      before the First-tier Tribunal  dated  9  February  2016.  In  it  she
      referred to herself as a British citizen. She stated  with  regard  to
      the the refusal decision  dated  21  May  2015,  that  the  respondent
      refused the application for two reasons, namely that they were not  in
      a genuine and subsisting relationship; and that she did not  meet  the
      financial requirements.


  18. She also referred to the earlier determination of  Judge  Gribble  who
      found that the appellant has a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
      with  her.  She  also  made  assertions  relating  to  the   financial
      requirements.


  19. She did not give any evidence in respect of her immigration history.


  20. I have also had  regard  to  the  appellant's  own  witness  statement
      produced to the First-tier Tribunal dated 9  February  2016.  He  also
      referred to his wife as  a  British  national  and  the  holder  of  a
      passport.


  21. At paragraph 7 of his statement he referred  to  the  refusal  of  his
      application dated 15 October 2014, where the  respondent  acknowledged
      that his partner had lived in the UK since 2004 and is in  employment.
      The respondent asserted in the  refusal  that  although  she  and  her
      partner have lived together in the UK since 2004 and is in  employment
      here, this did not mean that they  are  unable  to  live  together  in
      Pakistan. Although relocating there may cause a degree of hardship for
      his British partner, the respondent was not satisfied that  there  are
      insurmountable  obstacles   preventing   him   from   continuing   his
      relationship in Pakistan.

  22. It appears from paragraph 7 of the appellant's witness statement  that
      Judge Gribble did consider  EX.1.   The  appellant  asserted  that  in
      making the determination in respect of EX.1, Judge Gribble  took  into
      account that they have a genuine and subsisting relationship.


  23. I  have  also  had  regard  to  page  9  of  Judge  Ross's  record  of
      proceedings. There do not appear to have been any specific submissions
      relating to insurmountable obstacles and Article 8.


  24. I have also had regard to the grounds of appeal presented to the First-
      tier Tribunal against the refusal dated 21 May 2015.  The  grounds  in
      the main assert that they have a genuine and subsisting  relationship.
      There was also a ground based on evidential flexibility in respect  of
      the income requirements, including the fact that the respondent  found
      that some documents were not in the prescribed format.


  25. There were also additional grounds of appeal under  the  Human  Rights
      Convention, "particularly with reference  to  procedural  fairness"  -
      paragraph 1 of the additional grounds.  The  appellant  also  asserted
      that the respondent failed to apply the law correctly to the facts  of
      the appellant's case. He had a legitimate expectation of  facts  being
      considered in the light of the human rights legislation.  There was no
      pressing social need to deny the right to remain  in  the  UK  to  the
      spouse of a person present and settled in the UK. He is not  a  threat
      to the community.


  26. There were however no grounds raised against the respondent's decision
      with regard to EX.1 or paragraph 276ADE (1)(vi).


  27. In Judge Gribble's determination it is noted that the  respondent  had
      also contended that there were no insurmountable obstacles  preventing
      the appellant from continuing his relationship in Pakistan,  and  that
      EX.1(B) was not met. Nor did he qualify under  paragraph  276ADE.  The
      respondent did not consider  that  there  would  be  very  significant
      obstacles to his integration into the country he would have to  go  to
      if required to leave  the  UK  -  [6d].  Nor  were  there  exceptional
      circumstances warranting a grant of leave outside the rules.


  28. Judge Gribble noted the appellant submitted that his Article 8  rights
      to private and family life would be disproportionately interfered with
      by a decision to remove him [9].


  29. Judge Gribble also heard oral evidence. The appellant had adopted  his
      witness statement. In cross examination, he said that if he went  back
      to Pakistan his wife would support any application he made to  return.
      He did not wish to go back as he had a joint life in the  UK  and  did
      not want to be separated. He said that his sponsor was  already  under
      stress [13].


  30. Ms Mughal also adopted her witness statement and gave  evidence  [13].
      In  cross  examination  she  confirmed  that  she  would  support  her
      husband's application if he went back to Pakistan though she  did  not
      see why he should go if she could support him in the UK. She said that
      she has friends in the UK as did her husband and she did not  wish  to
      return to Pakistan as she did not want the stress of  that  happening.
      She confirmed that there was nothing else to stop the appellant making
      an application from Pakistan [15].


  31. In his submissions  to  Judge  Gribble  on  behalf  of  the  appellant
      experienced counsel  acknowledged  that  whilst  the  appellant  could
      return to Pakistan and there was no real barrier  to  this,  it  would
      disrupt family life and be costly. He pointed out that the appellant's
      wife was obviously tense and worried and there was no  guarantee  that
      entry clearance would be granted. The sponsor needed to take time  out
      to visit him and this may make  her  income  dip  below  the  required
      level.


  32. There were  accordingly  no  submissions  made  before  Judge  Gribble
      relating to the sponsor's alleged refugee status.


  33. Judge Gribble made a finding in respect of EX.1 at [29]. The appellant
      would be returning to the country he left fairly recently. There would
      be a period  of  adjustment.  There  would  not  be  very  significant
      difficulties in continuing family life in Pakistan. Nor would there be
      very serious hardship for the appellant or his partner in returning as
      they would be going to their country of birth. They speak the language
      and they have a level of education and skills that would  assist  them
      in finding employment.


  34. Judge Gribble also considered "for the sake of completeness" the  case
      under Article 8, following the five step process outlined in Razgar  -
      [33]


  35. In assessing the proportionality of the proposed decision,  he  stated
      that both the appellant and his wife were clear that the  relationship
      would continue if the appellant had to temporarily  leave  the  UK  to
      make a fresh application to enter. Their reasoning for  the  appellant
      not doing this seemed to be cost and the fact that their  relationship
      was quite new. His wife expressed "stress" if her husband had to leave
      to make a fresh application.


  36. These considerations did not outweigh the public  interest  imperative
      of maintaining immigration control  [38-39].  There  was  no  evidence
      before him of any mental health problems suffered by  the  appellant's
      wife. He accordingly found the decision to be proportionate.


  37. Notwithstanding the findings of Judge Gribble in respect of  EX.1  and
      paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi),  neither  the  appellant  nor  her   sponsor
      contended before Judge Ross on 3 March 2016 that they would be  unable
      to go back to Pakistan associated with her grant of status in the UK.


  38. The findings of Judge Ross at [17] including the fact that the sponsor
      was born in Lahore and clearly  has  a  connection  to  Pakistan,  are
      accordingly sustainable.


  39. With regard to the Article 8 assessment, he noted that  there  are  no
      children who are adversely affected by  the  decision;  there  are  no
      health issues. Looking at the evidence he considered that the decision
      was proportionate [20].


  40. Although it has now been contended at page 2 in the grounds of  appeal
      to the Upper Tribunal that it was obvious that the  couple  could  not
      live in Pakistan without hardship, neither the appellant nor his  wife
      gave any evidence of hardship based  upon  her  status.   Neither  the
      appellant nor his wife had even referred to that in  their  respective
      witness statements, nor in their oral  evidence.  Nor  was  there  any
      evidence that any specific submissions were made in  respect  of  that
      issue.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  did  not  involve  the
      making of any material error on a point of law. It  shall  accordingly
      stand.


      No anonymity direction is made.
