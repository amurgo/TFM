Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr McQuitty, instructed by John J Rice & Company
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant, a citizen of Pakistan  against  the
    decision of  FtTJ  Gillespie  who  dismissed  her  appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision refusing to issue a  permanent  residence
    card as a family member of Mr  [SS],  a  German  national.   They  were
    married in Pakistan in 1978.  The judge recorded at [3] of his decision
    the basis of the Secretary of State's refusal:

         "3.  The respondent determined that she had  not  provide  adequate
             evidence  to  show  that  she  was  entitled  to  a  permanent
             residence card on the basis of the claim that her husband  had
             been exercising Treaty rights in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
             continuous  period  of  five  years.   She  had  provided  her
             application pension  credit  letters  for  her  husband,  bank
             statements for both of them and gas bills ranging from 2010 up
             to 2017.  She claims to have lived in Pakistan until 2011 when
             she joined her husband in Northern Ireland in that year."

    The judge continued at [4]:

         "4.  The decision maker determined that she had not  evidenced  how
             her husband, as  her  EEA  national  sponsor,  was  exercising
             Treaty rights in the United Kingdom with details  to  back  up
             what she said in her application form.  The Home Office  would
             not accept  as  evidence  of  his  exercising  Treaty  rights,
             documents that showed he was dependent on state benefits.  The
             Home Office could also  only  accept  a  retention  of  worker
             status for a maximum of six  months.   Her  husband  began  to
             receive  Job  Seeker's  allowance  (JSA)  in   2012/2013   and
             thereafter  remained  unemployed  until  to  date.    Evidence
             produced with her  application  showed  that  he  was  getting
             Pension  Credit.   The  decision-makers  refusal  letter  also
             records that she had not provided any documents  from  earlier
             years of  employment  which  the  Home  Office  could  use  as
             evidence of him exercising Treaty rights."

 2. The judge noted in his decision that the case had come  before  another
    First-tier Tribunal Judge, First-tier Tribunal Judge Hutchinson, on  22
    June  2018  when  gaps  were  revealed  in  the  appellant's  husband's
    employment record as follows:

         "7 March 2006 - 31 March 2008


         20 March 2009 - 4 October 2009


         6 October 9 - 14 November 2009


         16 November 2009 - 13 March 2010


         26 July 2010 - 31 August 2010


         29 May 2011 - June 2012"

 3. The hearing was adjourned to enable further enquiries to be  made  with
    HM Revenue and Customs.

 4. In paragraph [6] of his decision, the  judge  observed  that  a  letter
    dated 6 August 2018 had been produced which  recorded  the  appellant's
    husband's earnings for each of the four tax years commencing 2008/2009,
    in the fourth of  which  he  is  recorded  as  receiving  Job  Seeker's
    Allowance for 2012/2013.

 5. Judge Gillespie made the following findings:

         "19.  I  have  considered  the  evidence  in  the  round  and   the
             submissions of the parties.   There  is  no  evidence  of  the
             appellant's husband being continuously employed prior to  2008
             and the HM Revenue & Customs letter records  that  he  started
             receiving  JSA  during  the  tax  year  2012/2013   which   is
             consistent with his oral  evidence  that  he  stopped  working
             entirely in July/August of that year.   The  most  the  letter
             shows, when taken with his  oral  evidence,  is  that  he  was
             employed for circa three and a half years.

         20.  Mr Jebb said evidence was being insisted upon, going back some
             time and it was very difficult for  an  individual  to  retain
             evidence of that nature.  The appellant had done her best, and
             in his view, there was clear evidence  that  her  husband  had
             worked continuously for at least five years.

         21.  I find the evidence shows her husband stopped working in  2013
             with a period thereafter when he  received  JSA  and  then  no
             record of any employer up until the present.

         22.  A person who ceased working may continue to be  treated  as  a
             worker in the circumstances set out in Regulation 6(2) but may
             only retain worker status, for a maximum of six months.  There
             is no evidence that her  husband  fulfilled  any  requirements
             necessary to retain worker status after stopping work entirely
             in June/July 2013 up until he began to draw the State  Pension
             and which presumably occurred when he turned 65.   It  appears
             he  stopped  working  some  four  years  before   the   normal
             retirement age.

         23.  There is no evidence of sufficient weight to show that he  was
             continuously employed  prior  to  2008  and  indeed  the  oral
             evidence of the  parties  would  point  to  the  community  of
             employment being broken on  occasions  and  her  indeterminate
             periods when he returned to Pakistan."

 6. The grounds of challenge on which permission  has  been  granted  argue
    that  the  judge  had  erred  in  dealing  with  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's husband's employment.  Erroneously the judge  had  referred
    to the letter from HMRC dated 6 August 2018 covering four  rather  than
    five years and thus the Job Seekers Allowance was in  the  fifth  year.
    Furthermore, the appellant's husband had not received any  benefits  in
    the fifth year.  The judge had found as  a  matter  of  fact  that  the
    appellant's husband had stopped working in June/July 2013 and there was
    clear evidence in the HMRC letter that he had  been  working  for  five
    years previous to that rather than for three and a half years as  found
    in the decision.  Furthermore, there was  evidence  of  his  employment
    prior to 2008, being two P45s dated 8 June 2005 and 11 April 2007 which
    the judge had failed to consider.

 7. Regulation 15 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016 provides, relevant to the issue in this case:

         "15.-    (1)  The following persons acquire the right to reside  in
                  the United Kingdom permanently-

                  (a)  an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom
                      in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous
                      period of five years;

                  (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not an  EEA
                      national but who has resided in  the  United  Kingdom
                      with  the  EEA  national  in  accordance  with  these
                      Regulations for a continuous period of five years;

                  ..."

 8. Brief  submissions  were  made  by  the  parties  after  they  had  the
    opportunity of conferring; Mr Diwnycz explained that he  accepted  that
    the judge had clearly erred in the light of  the  documentary  evidence
    relied on by Mr McQuitty.  This included not only the letter from  HMRC
    dated  6  August  2018  which  relates  to  the  appellant's  husband's
    employment from 2008 until 2013 where his final post appears to  be  at
    Bombay Dreams but also another document being  a  letter  from  Bumbles
    Delicatessen dated 19 March 2009.  This is in the following terms:

         "This is to confirm that Mr  [SS],  d.o.b.  01/06/51,  resident  of
         [Belfast] is a permanent  employee  of  Bumbles  Delicatessen  Ltd.
         since 1 April 2008.  He is employed full-time as Curry Chef at  the
         rate of ï¿½6.00 per hour, 40 hours per week."

    This letter was before the judge on which he made no  adverse  finding.
    The error he made relates to the commencement date for the  calculation
    of  the  period  of  employment  in  question  when  finding  that  the
    appellant's partner had been employed  for  "circa  three  and  a  half
    years".  The judge made a positive finding that the appellant's husband
    had stopped working as stated in 2013.  Mr  Diwnycz  acknowledged  that
    evidence of his five years'  earnings  had  in  fact  been  shown,  and
    accordingly conceded the judge erred in law.

 9. I set aside the decision of Judge Gillespie for error of law.   By  way
    of re-making the decision, Mr Diwnycz acknowledged  with  reference  to
    the  letter  from  HMRC  that  the  appellant's  husband   had   worked
    continuously for a five year period and  so  exercising  treaty  rights
    between 1 April 2008 and June 2013.  Mr Diwnycz confirmed that this was
    the only issue in the appeal, having regard to the reasons given by the
    Secretary of State for refusing the application in his letter dated  28
    September 2017.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The decision of the FtT is set  aside  for  error  of  law.   I  remake  the
decision and allow the appeal against the Secretary of State's decision.
