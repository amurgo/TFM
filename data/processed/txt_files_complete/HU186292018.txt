For the Appellant:     Mr U Ezeoke (Counsel, instructed by Pillai & Jones,
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. In this decision the term Appellant refers to Mr A Islam who was the
   Appellant before the First-tier Tribunal and the term Respondent will
   refer to the Secretary of State. This is to preserve uniformity in the
   terminology used and to avoid confusion although this is an appeal by the
   Secretary of State against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

2. The Appellant's application for leave to remain (LTR) made on the basis
   of his family life with his partner was refused by the Secretary of State
   for the reasons given in the Refusal Letter of the 21st of August 2018.
   The Appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Jones at
   Taylor House on the 14th of February 2014 and allowed for the reasons
   given the decision promulgated on the 4th of March 2019.

3. The findings are set out in paragraphs 36 to 51 of the decision. The
   Judge accepted that the Appellant and Sponsor were in a genuine and
   subsisting relationship but did not accept that the Appellant could rely
   on paragraphs EX.1/2. The evidence relating to the relevant period pre-
   application was such that the Appellant did not meet the terms of
   Appendix FM-SE regarding earnings but that there were savings of �20,000
   for the year to June 2018. The Appellant did not meet the English
   language requirement but the Judge took the view that the Appellant's
   position overlooked paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and his ability to return to
   Bangladesh.

4. The issue of whether there were exceptional circumstances was considered
   from paragraph 41 onwards. The Appellant's relationship was accepted as
   was his ability to speak English. The Judge noted the Appellant's poor
   immigration history and that little weight attached to the relationship
   established in the circumstances noted. The Appellant's wife's objections
   to moving to Bangladesh was that for health condition she would be
   starting with new team of clinicians, not that treatment was not
   available, she had not given evidence that she would not go (paragraph
   45).

5. Having referred to Chikwamba and Chen the Judge found that the Sponsor's
   dip in earnings was explained by her taking a new job and temporary hours
   and that there were significant savings. It was unfortunate that the
   Appellant had not taken an English language test but as the Appellant
   spoke fluently in giving evidence an application for entry clearance, in
   the view of the Judge, "might well be granted." As the Appellant's wife's
   health could be exacerbated by the stress of his removal the Judge found
   that the balance fell in the Appellant's favour.

6. The submissions are set out in the Record of Proceedings and both
   representatives made submissions in line with their respective positions.
   With regard to finance Mr Ezeoke referred to the Sponsor's current
   account which showed a balance of over �9,000 over the same period. Mr
   Clarke accepted he had overlooked that but observed that the Appellant
   still did not meet the rules in the absence of an English language test.

7. In the course of the Appellant's submissions I asked what obstacles
   there were to family life being pursued abroad. Mr Ezeoke referred to the
   Sponsor's medical condition, the evidence that to have a child they would
   have to stay in the UK and that treatment would have to start again and
   that to start again would be disproportionate

8. At the end of the hearing I reserved the decision both on the issue of
   whether there was an error and also as to the disposal of the appeal with
   the options being that either I remade the decision or remitted the
   appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. Mr Clarke had submitted that if I
   found an error I could remake the decision, for the Appellant remittal
   was urged in those circumstances.

9. As it was accepted that the Appellant did not meet the Immigration Rules
   at the time of the application, both with regard to finance and there
   being no English language test, compelling circumstances were required to
   justify a grant of leave outside the rules. As the Judge had noted the
   relationship had been commenced when the Appellant's status was
   precarious and accordingly attracted little weight. The Appellant could
   not rely on EX.1, not only could the Appellant be expected to return to
   Bangladesh but from the findings made and with the Sponsor not having
   given evidence that she would remain in the UK there would be no basis
   for finding that family could not reasonably be pursued in Bangladesh.

10. On the Appellant's side there was the finding that the relationship was
   genuine and subsisting and the Appellant had been supported by the
   Sponsor. Her health was an issue but the objection to her going to
   Bangladesh was that she would be starting afresh with a new set of
   clinicians, not that treatment could not be obtained there. While there
   was the preference of the UK doctors that if she were to get pregnant it
   would be better if treatment took place in the UK there was no evidence
   to show that in such circumstances she would be unable to receive
   suitable treatment in Bangladesh. This aspect had to be seen in the
   context of the circumstances in which the relationship started and the
   reduced weight that it attracted.

11. Article 8 is not a by-pass to the Immigration Rules or a stand-alone
   provision. As indicated above the fact that the Appellant could not meet
   the Immigration Rules was a weighty factor that counted against him. The
   fact that the Appellant cannot meet the English test requirement is not
   obviated by the Judge's own assessment of the Appellant's skills, in
   doing so the Judge failed to give the Immigration Rules the weight that
   they deserved.

12. The Appellant's immigration was an additional factor that counted
   against him. In terms of the view of the ECtHR on what constitutes
   exceptional factors guidance is given in the case of Jeunesse [2014] ECHR
   1309. In that case the Appellant had lived in the Netherlands for 17
   years making applications with no effort by the state to remove her, that
   fact combined with her having been, at one stage, a Dutch national were
   exceptional circumstances justifying a grant of leave under article 8.
   Had it not been for those 2 factors the view of the ECtHR was that it
   would have been reasonable to expect the family, if they wished to remain
   together as a unit, to relocate to Indonesia where she remained a
   citizen.

13. The Appellant's time in the UK was illegal following his failure to
   leave the UK at the end of his working holiday visa and he had only
   started to make applications to remain in 2017, at no stage could the
   Appellant point to the factors that weighed heavily in the case of
   Jeunesse. In effect against the background of the Appellant's lengthy
   overstaying there was a short period in which the Appellant had made 2
   applications, the second given rise to these proceedings. In my view
   there was no basis for the Judge relying on 2 applications, made in
   fairly short order, as factors weighing positively in the balancing
   exercise. The applications had to be seen in the context of the lengthy
   illegal and earlier precarious presence and those circumstances remained
   to be held against the Appellant as the Judge had earlier noted.

14. When the application was made the financial information relied on did
   not meet the Immigration Rules. That the Sponsor's current account post-
   application provides sufficient funds with the savings account to make up
   the shortfall does not take the matter much further as the Appellant does
   not meet the rules for other reasons. In essence the matters taken by the
   Judge to be compelling had been discounted as having any effect under the
   rules, in those circumstances it was contradictory and without foundation
   to give them any weight in the balancing exercise.

15. For the reasons given I find that the Judge made an error of law in the
   approach taken to the underlying facts and, having accepted that the
   Appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules, finding that there were
   compelling circumstances that would make removal disproportionate. As
   noted above the Judge had effectively, if not explicitly, found that
   family life could reasonably be enjoyed in Bangladesh. The only factor
   that might have counted against such a finding was the Sponsor's medical
   condition and her objection was starting again with a new team. Given
   that her condition was known when the relationship started it had to be
   seen in that context. As the Sponsor could reasonably be expected to join
   the Appellant in Bangladesh the consequences of a decision to remain in
   UK were not relevant.

16. In my view in the absence of compelling factors and on the basis that
   family life could reasonably be enjoyed in Bangladesh if the couple would
   prefer to live in the UK the appropriate way forward is for the Appellant
   to do what he should have done years ago and return to Bangladesh and to
   apply in the usual way as most people in his situation actually do. The
   prospects of such an application are not a matter that come into
   consideration although I observe that if the Appellant leaves
   voluntarily, takes and passes the appropriate English test and evidence
   to meet the provisions of Appendix FM and FM-SE is submitted he will be
   in a considerably stronger position than before.

17. On the basis of the foregoing I set aside the decision of Judge Jones.
   On the evidence that is available I am satisfied that I have sufficient
   information to remake the decision and that remittal is unnecessary. I
   remake the decision dismissing the appeal of the Appellant for the
   reasons given above.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision. I remake the decision and dismiss the substantive
appeal of Mahbabul Islam

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing this appeal I make no fee award.
