    JUDGE CRAIG:  The applicant in this case is a national of  Vietnam  who
    was born on 30 April 1975.  She arrived in this country in October 2002
    and claimed asylum on arrival.  Her claim was refused by the respondent
    and her appeal rights were exhausted on 23 April  2003.   Thereafter  a
    One-Stop Notice was served and although there was  some  correspondence
    received from the applicant's representative she disappeared from sight
    for a number of years.  Then in February 2011  further  representations
    were received and it appears the file was allocated to that  department
    of the  respondent's  which  was  considering  legacy  cases  and  what
    happened thereafter is a matter which is disputed between the  parties.
    What is certainly the case is that on 12 February 2014  the  respondent
    wrote two letters to the applicant informing her that her case had been
    fully reviewed, that she did not qualify for a grant of leave to remain
    and that she had no basis on which she could lawfully remain in the UK.

 2. The applicant seeks to challenge that decision and her claim is founded
    essentially on a letter which she claims was  sent  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent to her former solicitors (which  I  understand  was  a  sole
    practitioner firm) dated 26 August 2011, in the following terms:

         "I am writing to provide an update on your client's case  which  is
         being dealt with by the Case Assurance and Audit Unit.

         We have now reviewed  your  client's  case  and  subject  to  final
         security checks our decision is to grant your client leave in  line
         with current Immigration Rules.

         Before we despatch the details and confirmation  of  your  client's
         leave, to ensure that we  have  the  correct  details,  we  require
         confirmation of certain  details  on  the  attached  pro-forma  and
         return to the address at the bottom of this form.

         If you or your client supplied these details  in  response  to  our
         letter dated 31 July 2011 you do not need to return the pro-forma."

    There is a stamp at the bottom of this letter which  purports  to  show
    that it was received presumably by the applicant's former solicitors on
    6 September 2011.

 3. Permission to bring these proceedings has been granted and the basis of
    the application is that because this letter was sent the applicant  had
    a "legitimate expectation" that she would be allowed to remain  in  the
    UK and  that  the  respondent  cannot  now  lawfully  resile  from  the
    indication which was given in that letter.

 4. The grounds are in the following terms at paragraphs 16 to 18:

         "16. The claimant further submits that, having been  informed  that
             she was to [be] granted leave, subject to security checks, she
             had a legitimate expectation that such leave would be  granted
             within a reasonable period thereafter.  It is  submitted  that
             30 months is not  such  a  reasonable  period  and  that  this
             expectation has therefore been unlawfully thwarted.  There has
             been a miscarriage of justice and  the  respondent's  decision
             dated 12 February 2014 is unreasonable to the extent of  being
             unlawful and flawed.

         17.  At the very least, it is submitted, the claimant  is  entitled
             to an explanation  as  to  why  having  decided  earlier  that
             subject to the  purported  security  checks,  leave  would  be
             granted, there was a u-turn by the respondent and  as  to  why
             she was not granted leave to remain.

         18.  It is submitted that the respondent's letter dated  26  August
             2011 cannot be withdrawn because a decisive step was taken  by
             communicating the decision to the claimant and the  respondent
             did not have the locus poenitentiae to withdraw  it  after  2�
             years and issue a fresh decision refusing her leave to  remain
             in the UK."

 5. The argument which is now before me  can  be  summarised  very  briefly
    indeed.  It is submitted on behalf of  the  applicant  first  that  the
    Tribunal should accept that the letter of 26 August 2011 was a  genuine
    letter which had been sent by the respondent to  the  applicant's  then
    solicitors and secondly, if this is right, that  that  in  itself  gave
    rise to a legitimate expectation that the applicant would be allowed to
    remain such that the respondent's fresh decision is unlawful.

 6. It is accepted on behalf of the  applicant  that  unless  the  Tribunal
    accepts that the letter of 26 August 2011 was a genuine letter actually
    sent, her case cannot get off the ground.  It is not suggested that she
    has a good case otherwise on the merits and it is  clear,  particularly
    following the decision of the Court of Appeal in SH (Iran) &  Others  v
    SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1469, that she does not have any  general  grounds
    under the legacy policy on which she  could  properly  argue  that  the
    decision in 2014 was an unlawful one.  Indeed it is clear on the  facts
    of this case that subject to the letter  said  to  have  been  sent  in
    August 2011 to which I will refer in more detail below,  her  claim  is
    entirely unmeritorious insofar as it is founded on what is said to have
    been the respondent's  then  "legacy  policy".   Accordingly,  the  two
    questions before the  Tribunal  now  are  first  whether  it  has  been
    established that the letter of 26 August 2011 is a  genuine  one  which
    was actually sent and secondly, even if it was, whether  the  applicant
    could succeed in any event.

 7. So far as the first issue  is  concerned  the  respondent  submitted  a
    witness statement from a Mr Bray in which Mr Bray gave his reasons  for
    considering that the letter was not a genuine letter actually  sent  by
    someone  in  the  Home  Office.   This  letter  was  exhibited  to  the
    Acknowledgement of Service and Mr Bray's reasons for  considering  that
    the letter was not genuine are contained within  paragraph  12  of  his
    witness statement.  Mr Bray is a Senior Executive  Officer  in  the  UK
    Visas and Immigration Department of the respondent and has considerable
    day-to-day knowledge of dealing with letters of  this  type.   Mr  Bray
    states as follows  at  paragraph  12  of  his  witness  statement  when
    considering whether or not the letter was genuine:

         "12. Notwithstanding  that  there  is  no  necessity  for  a  final
             decision as to whether the Letter was  genuinely  sent  to  be
             made by the Tribunal [sic], it is possible to conclude on  the
             evidence that it was not sent by the Home Office.  There are a
             number  of  factors  that  weigh  against  the  Letter   being
             considered to be genuine  that  have  led  the  Respondent  to
             conclude that it was not  sent  by  the  Home  Office.   These
             include -

             a.   The sending  of  the  Letter  is  inconsistent  with  the
                  internal records - in particular the recording of the case
                  as a refusal case on the relevant mail merge  records  and
                  the corresponding absence of  any  record  of  the  Letter
                  being sent or inclusion of  the  case  in  the  'potential
                  grant' spreadsheet of the 'Mail Merge' exercise that could
                  have generated such a Letter.  It is  not  impossible  for
                  the Letter to have been sent without being recorded on the
                  relevant GCID database but if  a  potential  grant  letter
                  were sent it should have been  on  the  appropriate  'Mail
                  Merge' list unless it was a total aberration  and  not  on
                  the refusal list;

             b.   The absence of any proof of posting or  other  provenance
                  provided by the Applicant;

             c.   Although the original of the Letter belatedly sent to the
                  Treasury Solicitor by the Applicant's representatives on 6
                  October 2014 has a wording consistent with the  templates,
                  the appearance of the Letter  does  not  ring  true  -  in
                  particular, the offsetting of the letter head; and

             d.    The  Applicant's  behaviour  appears  inconsistent  with
                  receipt  of  such  a  letter  and  the  formation  of  any
                  legitimate expectation that it was a  grant  of  leave  to
                  remain  or  a  potential  grant  of   leave   to   remain.
                  Remarkably, the Applicant  made  a  paid  application  for
                  leave to remain after the date of stated  receipt  of  the
                  Letter, on 8 January 2013, under Article 8 of the European
                  Convention on Human Rights.  The cost of that  application
                  was �561.  This shows that the Applicant did not  rely  on
                  the Letter in any relevant way  as  a  resolution  of  her
                  immigration status.  If  the  applicant  thought  she  was
                  being granted leave to remain by reason of the Letter some
                  5 months earlier it would be expected that she would chase
                  up that letter rather than pay to make an application  for
                  limited leave to remain on a different basis."

 8. I should state that Mr Bray does not seek to suggest (and this is clear
    from paragraph 13 of his witness statement) that the applicant  herself
    was personally responsible for the deception which he believes occurred
    and remarks in this respect that "there are a number of other ways that
    a letter of this nature may have come into being that  do  not  involve
    the complicity of the applicant or any involvement of the Home Office".
     That may be a rather discreet way of suggesting that  the  applicant's
    former solicitors might have created this letter because it is hard  to
    see how otherwise a letter which is not a genuine letter of  this  type
    could be said to have come within that solicitor's custody.

 9. In support of the applicant's claim with regard  to  the  letter  being
    genuine Mr Hussain dealt with  the  reasons  given  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent by Mr Bray in his witness statement as follows.  With regard
    to the reason given at 12.a he emphasises that Mr Bray had said that it
    was "not impossible" for that letter to have been sent.  He  makes  the
    point that relying on internal records, it was at least  possible  that
    that letter could have been sent.

10. Regarding the objection made at 12.b which was the absence of any proof
    of posting or other provenance provided by the applicant he  says  that
    as the applicant's solicitors received this letter it would  have  been
    very unlikely for them to have  been  able  to  provide  any  proof  of
    posting.

11. Then with regard to c. it is submitted that while Mr Bray says that the
    letter "does not ring true", it did nonetheless have wording consistent
    with the templates and this was a  subjective  comment.   He  complains
    that the respondent had not provided any forensic report or a  document
    verification report and on this basis there was  insufficient  evidence
    on which the Tribunal could on this ground find that the letter was not
    a genuine one.  Also  he  says  that  Mr  Bray's  statement  that  "the
    appearance of the letter does not ring true" in which Mr Bray refers in
    particular to the offsetting of the letter heading is "far too vague to
    cast doubt on the document".

12. Finally, with regard to the reason given  at  d.,  which  is  that  the
    applicant's behaviour in  subsequently  making  an  application  to  be
    allowed to remain under Article 8 at a cost of  �561  was  inconsistent
    with her having received this  letter,  his  explanation  is  that  the
    applicant was not aware of the significance of this  letter  until  her
    current solicitors became engaged which was not until  after  the  2014
    decision of which complaint is now made.  In answer to a question  from
    the Tribunal as to how if this was right the applicant could be said to
    have had any expectation, legitimate or otherwise, that  she  would  be
    allowed to remain, Mr Hussain said that he would have to  address  that
    point "when we get to it".  It is also right to record in  this  regard
    that Mr Hussain accepted throughout  the  hearing  that  there  was  no
    evidence (other than that she made the application  to  be  allowed  to
    remain on article  8  grounds,  which  is  discussed  below)  that  the
    applicant at any time acted in reliance on what is said to have been in
    that letter.

13. With regard to this aspect of the case Ms Anderson first of all invited
    the Tribunal to note that there had been no application made on  behalf
    of the applicant to cross-examine Mr Bray which was the  proper  course
    which should have been taken in circumstances where his evidence was to
    be challenged.  In this regard she relied in particular on the judgment
    of Mr Justice Silber in R (on the application  of  Westech  College)  v
    SSHD [2011] EWHC  1484  (Admin)  which  itself  relied  on  a  previous
    decision made by the same judge in R (McVey) v SSHD [2010] EWHC (Admin)
    437.  At paragraph 27 Mr Justice Silber set out what should be regarded
    as the proper approach to be taken  when  evidence  is  disputed  on  a
    judicial review application as follows:

         "27. I did not understand Counsel to disagree with the view,  which
             I stated in the McVey case [35], which  was  that  the  proper
             approach to disputed evidence on a judicial review application
             is that:-

             '(i) the basic rule is  that  where  there  is  a  dispute  on
                  evidence in a judicial review  application,  then  in  the
                  absence of cross-examination, the facts in the defendants'
                  evidence must be assumed to be correct;

             (ii) an exception to this rule arises where the documents show
                  that the defendant's evidence cannot be correct; and that

             (iii)    the proper  course  for  a  claimant  who  wishes  to
                  challenge the correctness of an important  aspect  of  the
                  defendant's evidence relating to a factual matter on which
                  the judge will have to make a critical factual finding  is
                  to  apply  to  cross-examine  the  maker  of  the  witness
                  statement on which the defendant relies'."

14. Accordingly Ms Anderson submits it is very difficult now  to  challenge
    the evidence given by Mr Bray, particularly with regard to the feel and
    look of the letters.  Although this was not said in terms, in effect Mr
    Bray was giving expert evidence based upon his undoubted experience  in
    this field and if a challenge was to be made  to  this  evidence,  this
    should have been done properly which it was not.

15. As to the reasons which were given by Mr  Bray,  Ms  Anderson  properly
    drew the attention of the Tribunal to the restrained  manner  in  which
    the reasons were set out.  Mr Bray did not suggest  as  he  could  have
    done that it would be "impossible" for this to be a genuine letter  but
    nonetheless gave compelling reasons why it was very  unlikely  that  it
    was.  What was important in this case is that this is not  a  situation
    where records were not kept, because records were kept of what  letters
    were sent to all people whose cases were being considered under  legacy
    provisions.  In this case, if a letter had  been  wrongly  sent,  there
    should have been an audit trail showing that such  a  letter  had  been
    sent.   The  fact  that  there  was  not  was  a  factor  which   could
    legitimately be considered by Mr Bray as indicating that such a  letter
    was not sent out. As to the layout  and  typesetting  for  the  letter,
    again this is a matter regarding which Mr Bray was in a  good  position
    on which to advise because he had day-to-day experience of the  letters
    which were sent.  There was really no realistic explanation as to  why,
    if the file had wrongly travelled by mistake from the group in which it
    should have been kept, which was a group concerning  which  a  decision
    had not been taken provisionally to allow the claim, to the group where
    a provisional decision had been taken that the claim would be  allowed,
    this would not have been recorded. It would be highly unusual for  this
    not to show up in an audit trail.  That was the  effect  of  Mr  Bray's
    evidence.  He did not say that it was impossible but he  did  say  that
    there was only a very small chance of this having occurred.

16. It was common ground before me that the Tribunal has  to  consider  the
    issue of whether or not this was a genuine letter  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities. The respective representatives are not however agreed as
    to precisely what burden there is on the applicant to  establish  this.
    Mr Hussain on behalf of the applicant sought to persuade  the  Tribunal
    that although the burden was originally on the applicant to show that a
    letter was sent, having produced a letter which was said to  have  been
    genuine the burden somehow shifts to the respondent to  establish  that
    the letter was not genuine.  I agree with Ms Anderson that  the  burden
    does not shift merely because the applicant has produced a letter which
    she claims is a genuine one; in my judgement, the  burden  was  on  the
    applicant not just to establish on the balance of probabilities that  a
    letter was sent but that it  was  a  genuine  letter  which  was  sent.
    However, even if I had considered that Mr Hussain's submission on  this
    point was arguable, the respondent would still only have to satisfy the
    Tribunal on the balance  of  probabilities  that  the  letter  was  not
    genuine and so I turn to consider  this  issue  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence which is now before me.

17. In my judgment it is far more likely than not that the letter  said  to
    have been forwarded to the applicant by her former solicitors was not a
    genuine letter actually sent by the  respondent.  With  regard  to  the
    fourth reason given by Mr Bray for considering that the letter was  not
    a genuine one, while I accept that it is at least arguable that even if
    such a letter had been sent the applicant was not  aware  that  it  had
    been sent (and in this regard I also take note of Mr Bray's observation
    that he  does  not  seek  to  argue  that  the  applicant  herself  was
    personally involved in any deception) this does  not  mean  that  those
    advising the applicant were not. Athough I would prefer not to have  to
    make  a  specific  finding  on  this  point,   deceptive   conduct   by
    professional advisers is not unknown and I have to weigh what I  choose
    to believe is the inherent unlikelihood of  professional  people  being
    involved in deception of this kind against, and in the context of,  all
    the other reasons why it is believed that the letter is not  a  genuine
    one.

18. In this regard, even if the applicant herself might genuinely have been
    unaware that an indication had been given on behalf of  the  respondent
    that the respondent was minded to grant her leave to remain, if such  a
    letter  had  indeed  been  sent  to  her  previous  solicitor,  it   is
    surprising, to say the least, that  that   solicitor  should  not  have
    informed the applicant regarding this indication  and  further  advised
    that she did not need to spend  the  sums  she  subsequently  spent  on
    pursuing her article 8 application.

19. While I accept it is "not impossible" for a letter to  have  been  sent
    without being recorded on the correct database, it is also the case, as
    Mr Bray has stated, that this would have been very unlikely.

20. Although Ms Anderson has submitted that  a  competent  solicitor  would
    have kept the envelope containing a letter of this type  because  proof
    of when such a letter was received is  frequently  necessary,  in  this
    case I would not rule out the possibility that the absence of  such  an
    envelope could be explained by the chaotic nature  of  this  particular
    solicitor's offices (and in this regard I take note of  the  fact  that
    the date stamp put on the letter is some eleven days after  the  letter
    was apparently sent).  However, I cannot disregard the  evidence  given
    by Mr Bray that because of, in particular, the offsetting of the letter
    head and the appearance  of  the  letter  generally  as  compared  with
    genuine letters which he has seen, "the  letter  does  not  ring  true"
    because he is in a position to know about this.   As  I  have  remarked
    earlier, had the applicant wished to challenge  his  evidence  on  this
    point in accordance with the guidance given by  Mr  Justice  Silber  in
    Westech College she should have applied to cross-examine him which  she
    did not.

21. There is one final point which must be made  regarding  my  finding  on
    this point and it is this.  If and to the  extent  that  the  applicant
    wished to assert that the letter was genuinely received by  her  former
    solicitor, steps should have been taken to obtain at the very  least  a
    witness statement from him giving his account of how  it  was  that  he
    says that letter came into his possession. He should have  provided  an
    explanation as to why the date stamp on the letter is 11 days after the
    date it was apparently sent and, importantly, whether  he  advised  the
    applicant of the significance of this letter and if not, why  not.  The
    absence of that evidence, while not itself necessarily  decisive,  does
    significantly reduce the reliance which can be placed on the  assertion
    that  this  letter  was  genuinely   received   by   him.    In   these
    circumstances, although like Mr Bray, I could not be certain  that  the
    letter  was  not  a  genuine  one,  nonetheless,  on  the  balance   of
    probabilities, regardless of who has the burden of establishing this, I
    consider it much more likely than not that the letter was not a genuine
    one.

22. As has been accepted  on  behalf  of  the  applicant  that  effectively
    disposes of this application but I will still give  my  reasons  why  I
    consider that even had this letter been a genuine letter  sent  by  the
    respondent to the applicant her claim anyway would have been  bound  to
    fail.   It  is  trite  law  that  for  a  case  founded  on  legitimate
    expectation to succeed, unless there has  been  a  clear  statement  of
    policy which the respondent has not complied with  (in  which  case  it
    could properly be said that the respondent was not applying her  policy
    consistently as between different people) at the very  least  in  order
    for a claim founded on what is asserted to be a legitimate  expectation
    which is personal to the applicant to succeed the  person  making  that
    claim must arguably have acted to his or her detriment  in  consequence
    of the promise being made to her. I do not need for these  purposes  to
    trawl through the very many authorities which have been very  helpfully
    put before the Tribunal by Ms Anderson  on  behalf  of  the  respondent
    because the jurisprudence in this regard is very succinctly  summarised
    by Sedley LJ in R v  Department  of  Education  &  Employment  ex-parte
    Begbie [2001] 1WLR 1115, in which he stated  as  follows  at  paragraph
    101:

         "I have no difficulty with the  proposition  that  in  cases  where
         government has made known how it intends to exercise  powers  which
         affect the public at large it may be held to its word  irrespective
         of whether the applicant had been  relying  specifically  upon  it.
         The legitimate expectation in such a case is that  government  will
         behave towards its citizens as it says  it  will.   But  where  the
         basis of the claim  is,  as  it  is  here,  that  a  pupil-specific
         discretion should be exercised in certain pupils' favour, I find it
         difficult to see how a person who has not  clearly  understood  and
         accepted a representation of the decision-maker to that effect  can
         be said to have such an expectation at all.  A hope no  doubt,  but
         not an expectation."

23. I do not consider that there is a material  distinction  which  can  be
    made with regard to the government having stated a policy as to how  it
    would behave towards its  citizens  as  distinct  from  the  government
    stating how it will behave to people who are not its citizens  but  are
    nonetheless within the country but it cannot in  this  case  be  argued
    that there is any general policy which can be  relied  on  which  would
    support the proposition that leave to remain should be granted  and  so
    this case  is  very  similar  on  its  facts  to  the  situation  being
    considered by the Court of Appeal in Begbie. A further difficulty  that
    the applicant has now is that her case is advanced on  the  basis  that
    the only way in which it is said she acted to her  detriment  was  that
    she paid �561 which was the fee required for the application  she  made
    subsequently to be allowed to  remain  under  Article  8.   I  have  to
    confess I simply do not understand this argument because what  is  said
    is not that the applicant paid this fee because she was relying on  the
    promise which she says had been made in the letter of  26  August  2011
    but rather because she did not realise that such a promise had in  fact
    been made.  I do not see  how  it  could  possibly  be  said  in  those
    circumstances that she  acted  in  reliance  on  this  letter.   It  is
    accepted moreover that other than by making this application (which  as
    I have already noted was clearly not made in reliance on the letter  at
    all) the applicant's behaviour did not change a jot as a result of  the
    letter having been sent because she was  unaware  either  that  such  a
    letter had been sent or in any event what its implication might be.  It
    is hard to see how this can be distinguished  from  the  type  of  case
    contemplated by Sedley LJ in Begbie of "a person who  has  not  clearly
    understood and accepted a representation" in which  circumstances  that
    person could not have had any expectation at all.   The  applicant  has
    not acted to her detriment at all and  had  no  legitimate  expectation
    that she could rely on because she was not aware of any promise,  which
    is what it is said the letter amounted to, having been made to her.

24. Ms Anderson has made a number of other points all of which  are  in  my
    opinion good ones, but which it is not necessary to deal  with  in  any
    great detail given the substance of the decision which I  have  already
    made.  She notes that in any event even if the letter had actually been
    sent, it could only have been sent by mistake because it is clear  that
    the respondent had not intended to grant leave  and  in  any  event  no
    actual decision had been made.  The most that could be  said  regarding
    the August 2011 letter even if it had been  sent  is  that  subject  to
    certain checks the respondent at that time intended to give  some  form
    of leave to the applicant.  Further steps would still have  had  to  be
    taken  and  the  applicant  could  not  be  certain  that  leave  would
    ultimately be given. Furthermore, even if the applicant did believe she
    would be allowed to stay, before a decision could  be  quashed  on  the
    basis that the Tribunal ought to make the Secretary of State  abide  by
    the indication that had previously been given, it would have  to  weigh
    up the competing interests of the applicant on the one hand and society
    in general, represented by the Secretary of State,  on  the  other.  In
    this case, given the lack of merit  of  the  application  generally  it
    could by no means be assumed that a court or  Tribunal  would  put  the
    applicant's own interests which had  been  barely  affected  above  the
    interests of society generally to have the Immigration Rules upheld  in
    a consistent fashion.

25. It follows that this application must be dismissed and I so find.



Permission to appeal

26. Although no application has been made for permission to  appeal,  I  am
    nonetheless obliged to consider whether or not to grant  permission  to
    appeal pursuant to rule  44  (4B)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008.  I refuse permission to appeal because  there  is
    no error of law in my judgment.



Costs

27. I summarily assess costs in the sum of �10,000.
