Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms M. Cohen of Counsel instructed by Wilson
Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr. N. Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
     Tribunal Judge Miller, promulgated on 20 December  2016,  in  which  he
     dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to
     refuse asylum.


  2. As this is an asylum appeal I make an anonymity direction.


  3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:


     "The grounds assert (i) that the judge failed to reach a finding  on  a
     material issue namely whether the appellant's name identifies him as of
     Rwandan origin which is central to whether  he  would  be  at  risk  on
     return and (ii) failed to give sustainable reasons  for  rejecting  the
     expert report in the light of the background evidence.


     Albeit the judge cited BM and Others (returnees  -  criminal  and  non-
     criminal) DRC CG [2015] UKUT 00293 (IAC), the grounds are  arguable  in
     the light of AB and DM (Risk categories reviewed - Tutsis added) DRC CG
     [2005] UKIAT 00118."


  4. I heard brief submissions from Ms Cohen.   However,  Mr.  Bramble  then
     accepted that there was a material error of  law  in  the  decision  in
     relation to ground 1.  He also  accepted  that,  given  the  connection
     between ground 2 and ground 1, there was also a material error  of  law
     in the judge's treatment of the background evidence.


  5. I stated at the hearing that I agreed that the  decision  involved  the
     making of material errors of law and I set the decision aside.  My full
     reasons are set out below.


Error of law


  6. Ground 1 asserts that the judge failed to reach a finding on a material
     issue in the appeal, the Appellant's  names.   This  issue  is  closely
     bound up with ground 2, the rejection of the  expert  evidence  of  Dr.
     Kodi in the light of the background evidence.  The judge's reasons  for
     dismissing this evidence are set out in  paragraph  31.   This  a  long
     paragraph in which eight separate reasons are set out,  and  I  do  not
     intend to repeat it here.  Mr. Bramble submitted that, while  at  first
     view  it  would  appear  that  the  judge  had  conducted  a   thorough
     consideration of  Dr.  Kodi's  report,  when  looking  further  at  his
     findings the judge had followed the  approach  taken  by  the  previous
     judge, Judge Gladstone.  He had therefore concluded that the  Appellant
     was not of Rwandan ethnicity.


  7. The evidence of Dr. Kodi was new evidence and therefore, with reference
     to this evidence, the judge would have been able  to  depart  from  the
     findings  of  Judge  Gladstone,  taking  into  account  the   case   of
     Devaseelan.  However, by not accepting Dr. Kodi's evidence,  the  judge
     adopted Judge Gladstone's approach, and  failed  to  grapple  with  the
     issue of the Appellant's names.


  8.  I was referred by Ms Cohen to the case  of  K  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  302,
     paragraph 17.  This states:


     "The  expressions  "Rwandan  connections"  and  "Rwandan  origin"   are
     susceptible of different shades of meaning, and are  too  broad  in  my
     opinion for the AIT to  have  intended  them  to  define  a  hard-edged
     category of persons at risk without having heard any  argument  on  the
     point and without seeking to elaborate on what was precisely  meant.  A
     Rwandan connection may be strong, moderate or weak. In saying  that,  I
     do  not  wish  to  encourage  the  creation  of  a  hierarchy  of  some
     classifications. The simple  (inaudible)  is  that  the  expression  is
     perfectly understandable and should  be  understood  as  identifying  a
     factor which may cause a person to be at risk, depending  on  a  fuller
     consideration of the nature and strength of the connection. This is not
     something which can be done mechanistically. The critical  question  is
     whether the person would be perceived  as  hostile  to  the  regime  on
     account of his or her Rwandan-ness, if there is such a  word.  That  is
     likely to necessitate looking at a person's whole profile."


  9. I find that it was necessary for the judge to make a finding  regarding
     the  Appellant's  "Rwandan-ness"  before  going  on  to  consider   the
     implications of this.  Clearly his names are central to this issue.  As
     stated in paragraph [29] of K, when discussing the case of AB, "Rwandan-
     ness" is recognised as a risk category.


10. The judge states  that  "it  would  not  appear  that  [Dr.  Kodi]  has
    addressed the issue of whether the appellant's  names  are  exclusively
    Rwandan, or whether some  Congolese  have  identical  names"  [31(ii)].
    However, as pointed out by Mr. Bramble, Dr. Kodi had  dealt  with  this
    issue across all three of his reports.  I was referred  to  Dr.  Kodi's
    third report dated 18 November 2016, paragraph 17.  He states:-


    "I stand by my opinion expressed in previous reports  that  both  names
    are clearly of Rwandan origin.  While  preparing  this  report,  on  13
    November 2016, I consulted by telephone  three  Linguistics  Professors
    specialising on Kinyarwanda and based respectively at the University of
    Kinshasa, Catholic University of Goma (Universit� Catholique  de  Goma)
    and the Free University of the Great Lakes Countries (Universit�  Libre
    des Pays des Grands Lacs).  They all confirmed my opinion that [R]  and
    [N] are both typical Rwandan names. "


11. I was referred to  Dr.  Kodi's  second  report  dated  5  August  2015,
    paragraph 11:


    "As I stated in my previous report for this case, both names,  [R]  and
    [N], are typical Rwandan names and would be readily recognised  by  the
    Congolese as such.  Moreover, both of his parents' names are  typically
    Rwandan, which would enhance his risk since this fact would confirm his
    Rwandan ancestry.  By just reading the Rwandan press,  one  notes  that
    [R] is not only a common person's name in Rwanda but  it  is  also  the
    name of a town and an area of this country [...]  Articles  in  Rwandan
    newspapers also show that [N] is a common name in Rwanda."


12. In his first report dated 12 September  2012  Dr.  Kodi  addresses  the
    following question [3]:-


    "Please refer to paragraph 53  of  the  appeal  determination.   Please
    comment on the Immigration Judge's findings and in  particular  explain
    whether the client's name identifies him as being of Rwandan descent."


13. In response he states:  "Both names, [R] and [N], are  typical  Rwandan
    names and would be readily recognised by the Congolese as such.  [R] is
    not only a common person's name in Rwanda, but it is also the name of a
    town and an area of this country.  [N] is a common name  in  Rwanda  as
    well."


14. I find that, contrary to the judge's statement in paragraph 31(ii), Dr.
    Kodi addressed the issue of the Appellant's names in all three  of  his
    reports,  the  earliest  of  which  is  dated  2012.   He  specifically
    addressed the issue of  the  Appellant's  first  and  last  names,  and
    whether or not they are typically  Rwandan.   I  find  that  the  judge
    appears to have ignored the fact that in all  three  reports  Dr.  Kodi
    addressed the issue of the Appellant's names.  As a result,  the  judge
    has given less weight to Dr. Kodi's evidence  because  of  his  alleged
    failure to address this issue.   Further,  Dr.  Kodi  was  specifically
    referred to paragraph 53 of Judge Gladstone's  determination,  and  has
    acknowledged as such in his report.  This  is  the  same  paragraph  to
    which the judge refers at [31(ii)].


15. While the judge has referred to the case of BM and Others he has failed
    to refer to the case of AB and DM (Risk categories  reviewed  -  Tutsis
    added), where at paragraph 51 it states:


    "We  confirm  as  continuing  to  be  a  risk  category  those  with  a
    nationality or perceived nationality of a state regarded as hostile  to
    the DRC and in particular those who have or presumed  to  have  Rwandan
    connections or are of Rwandan origins."


    This is further expanded in paragraph 51(ii).


16. In the skeleton argument before the First-tier Tribunal,  at  paragraph
    33 there is a  reference  to  the  case  of  AM  and  BM,  albeit  that
    erroneously it states "AM and CM", but the  reference  is  correct.   I
    therefore  find  that  the  judge  was  referred  to  this  case,   and
    consequently there was evidence before him that  the  country  guidance
    held that there was a risk to those with Rwandan connections.  However,
    the  judge  states  that   Dr.   Kodi's   report   "contains   alarmist
    generalisations which are not supported by authoritative evidence".  He
    refers to Dr. Kodi's evidence that the Appellant would "likely  be  put
    in harm's way" in the DRC, and that "a  young  man  of  Rwandan  origin
    would likely be seen as a threat".


17. The grounds of appeal refer to three articles provided by the Appellant
    which are evidence of the anti-Rwandan attitudes in the DRC  (paragraph
    20c(i) to (iii)).  These support Dr. Kodi's evidence.  It was submitted
    by Mr. Bramble that it  was  not  clear  whether  the  judge  had  been
    directed to these and to particular parts of the bundle.  However it is
    clear that the judge was directed  to  the  country  guidance  case  in
    relation to people of Rwandan ethnicity, so he was aware of  the  issue
    of the treatment of Rwandans in the DRC.  He failed  properly  to  deal
    with this case in his approach to the Appellant's ethnicity.


18. I find that, when asserting that Dr. Kodi's report  contains  "alarmist
    generalisations", the judge has ignored the background evidence and the
    country guidance case [31(viii)].


19. I find that the judge's  finding  that  the  expert  evidence  was  not
    reliable is due to his failure to give due consideration to the content
    of the reports, and his failure  to  consider  the  background  country
    evidence which was before him, including  the  country  guidance  case.
    The fact that the judge did not properly engage with  the  evidence  of
    Dr. Kodi, and therefore failed to make a  finding  of  the  Appellant's
    names and his Rwandan connections, means that he then  failed  to  deal
    adequately with the evidence before him  regarding  how  the  Appellant
    would be treated on return as a result of any Rwandan connections.


20. I find that the decision involves the making of material errors of  law
    in the judge's failure to make a finding on the central  issue  of  the
    Appellant's names and his failure properly to consider both the  expert
    evidence, and the background evidence before him.


21. It was submitted that I should limit the scope of the remaking of  this
    appeal as there was no appeal in relation to the judge's  consideration
    of Article 8.  However, I find that the Appellant's claims  for  asylum
    and/or protection under  Articles  2  and  3,  even  if  they  are  not
    successful, necessarily  involve  issues  which  are  relevant  to  any
    Article 8 consideration.  I therefore do not limit the scope  on  which
    the appeal is to be remade.


22. I have taken account of the Practice Statement dated 10 February  2010,
    paragraph 7.2.  This contemplates that an appeal may be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal where the effect of the error has been to deprive a
    party before the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or  other
    opportunity for the party's case to be put to  and  considered  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Had the issue before me  related  exclusively  to
    the Appellant's names, I would have considered it appropriate to remake
    the decision in this Tribunal.  However, as was accepted  by  Ms  Cohen
    and Mr. Bramble, the issue of the Appellant's names goes  also  to  his
    credibility, and therefore given the nature and  extent  of  the  fact-
    finding necessary to enable this appeal to be remade, having regard  to
    the overriding objective, I find that it is appropriate to  remit  this
    case to the First-tier Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involves the making of material
    errors of law and I set the decision aside.


24. No findings are preserved.


25. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be remade.

Directions

(1)  At the hearing before me it became  apparent  that  the  Tribunal  file
    does not contain a copy of the Appellant's  bundle,  which  amounts  to
    about 500 pages.  I therefore direct that  a  consolidated  bundle,  to
    include all of the authorities and background  evidence  on  which  the
    Appellant intends to rely, be served  on  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
    least seven days in advance of the hearing.

(2)  Further, given the amount of background  evidence,  I  direct  that  an
    index of key passages be  provided  in  order  to  aid  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
