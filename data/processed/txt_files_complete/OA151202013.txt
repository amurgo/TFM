For the Appellant:     Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Vassiliou, of McGill & Co., Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The parties are as described above, but are referred to in the rest  of
    this determination as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant sought entry clearance as the spouse of a UK citizen.  By
    notice  dated  14th  June  2013  the  ECO  refused   that   application
    principally for these reasons:  (a)  exclusion  was  conducive  to  the
    public good; (b) there  was  no  proof  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship;  and  (c)  the  evidence  fell  short  of  the  financial
    requirements in the Rules.

 3. In a determination promulgated on 16th  May  2014,  Judge  P  A  Grant-
    Hutchison held in favour of the appellant on all three points.

 4. The ECO sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  these
    grounds:

      1) The rules of specified evidence  are  comprehensively  set  out  in
         Appendix FM-SE to the Rules.  These set out what types of  evidence
         are required, the periods they cover and the format they should  be
         in.  The Tribunal has had no regard to  this  ...its  findings  are
         therefore unsustainable.

      2) ....The Tribunal has not had regard  to  the  relevant  date.   For
         Appendix FM the significant date is the  date  of  application  and
         significant evidence is for the specified period before that  date.
         The Tribunal has not addressed the relevant evidence from prior  to
         22nd February 2013 (the date of application).   This  also  renders
         the conclusions unsustainable.

      3) It follows... that it is not clear what the sponsor's actual  gross
         annual income was at the date  of  application...  The  appeal  can
         therefore not be made out... It is also worth noting  that  if  the
         sponsor's current income does exceed the income threshold, there is
         no reason to prevent the appellant from making a fresh  application
         based on the sponsor's income at this time.

 5. The grounds go on to attack the findings related to  exclusion  in  the
    public  good.   They  do  not  seek  to  take  up  the  issue  of   the
    relationship.

 6. On 6th August 2014 permission was granted to appeal to the UT,  on  the
    view that the judge arguably failed to give reasons  for  finding  that
    the appellant met the requirements of Appendix FM-SE as to income.

 7. Mrs O'Brien submitted that applications and appeals of this nature  are
    determined as at  the  date  of  application  and  on  the  documentary
    evidence submitted therewith.  She said that there is no  case  law  on
    that point, but it is inherent in the scheme of Appendix  FM  which  is
    based  upon  evidence  in  specific  forms  being  provided  with   the
    application to the ECO.  No further documentation should be  looked  at
    on appeal.  In any event, the relevant date could be no later than  the
    date of decision, 14 June 2013, because in an  entry  clearance  appeal
    section 85(5) of the 2002 Act restricts  the  Tribunal  to  considering
    circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision to refuse.  Even
    if the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to look at  any  new  evidence,
    what was produced in this case went to periods beyond that  date.   The
    Tribunal did not direct itself as to any restriction on the evidence it
    might entertain.  Even looking at all the information  which  was  made
    available, the requirements of the Rules were not met  by  evidence  of
    the specified nature.  The judge appeared to have thought that  he  was
    able to take it from general oral evidence that income would  meet  the
    necessary level, even if the specified evidence in written form was not
    supplied.  The necessary evidence  of  pension  payment  and  the  full
    sequence of bank statements were not before the judge, as the appellant
    seemed to accept.  In those circumstances, the judge  could  only  have
    dismissed the appeal.

 8. In respect of the ground in relation to exclusion  being  conducive  to
    the public good, Mrs O'Brien had nothing to add.

 9. I indicated to Mr Vassiliou that he did  not  need  to  deal  with  the
    latter ground, but that there seemed to be considerable  difficulty  in
    identifying any basis on which the judge might have  been  entitled  to
    find that the financial requirements of the Rules were met.

10. Mr Vassiliou submitted that the appellant had only to prove  income  of
    ï¿½18,600 per annum.  The judge accepted that, made up of three sources -
    the appellant's  USA  pension;  the  sponsor's  USA  pension;  and  the
    sponsor's UK pension.  At the time of application she was receiving her
    USA pension but was unable to show the written evidence, because it did
    not then exist.  Evidence of the UK pension had been  provided  in  the
    hearing bundle, but the US pension evidence was still not available  at
    the hearing date.  Mr Vassiliou said that he had received such evidence
    only recently.  If the decision were to be re-made, he  would  seek  to
    have it admitted.  He submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  was  not
    limited to considering the matter either at the date of application  or
    at the date of decision, but could look at  it  on  an  ongoing  basis.
    Although no written application had been made for further  evidence  to
    be received now, it had only recently come to hand, and he  would  make
    that application orally.

11. I indicated that the Secretary of State's appeal would be  allowed  and
    the determination reversed.

12.  The  determination  contains   no   consideration   of   whether   the
    circumstances were to be assessed as at the date of application, at the
    date of decision,  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, or at some other date forecasting into the future.  That is a
    material error.

13. It may be from the scheme of these particular Rules that the matter  is
    to be tested as  at  the  date  of  application  and  by  the  evidence
    submitted therewith, although I am not fully persuaded on  that  point.
    It is clear that at latest the decisive date is that  of  decision,  in
    terms of section 85(5), and that the requirements of the Rules need  to
    be satisfied by specified evidence in the form required.  The Rules are
    prescriptive.  Oral evidence, no matter how convincing, and  incomplete
    documentary evidence could not make the case.   The  judge  appears  to
    have been misled by inaccurate presentation of the case  into  thinking
    that broadly persuasive  evidence  of  whatever  nature  and  going  to
    whatever date enabled the appeal to succeed.  That is not the scheme of
    the  Rules  or  of  the  appeal  jurisdiction.   It  was  the  duty  of
    representatives  to  address  the  evidential  requirements  much  more
    accurately than they did.

14. Mr Vassiliou's final submission was based upon proof  in  the  required
    form in accordance with  the  Rules  which  has  only  recently  become
    available.  It would not be permissible to  admit  that  evidence  now.
    Even if allowed in, it would not show  that  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules were met at the date of decision, the latest point at  which  the
    appellant could hope to succeed.

15. Mr Vassiliou made a faint attempt  to  argue  that  the  appeal  should
    succeed on the alternative basis of Article  8  ECHR.   However,  there
    cannot be any disproportionate interference with family life  interests
    where  the  appellant  has  the  opportunity  of  now  making  a  valid
    application for entry clearance.   (He  does  have  the  benefit  of  a
    positive outcome on the issues of relationship and of the public good.)

16. I notice one bizarre feature of the evidence, although it does not bear
    on the present outcome.  The sponsor says  that  her  mother,  who  has
    always lived on the Isle of Lewis, speaks only  Gaelic  and  so  cannot
    converse with the sponsor's daughter.  The sponsor's daughter says  the
    same.   This seems extremely unlikely, even  if  there  were  no  other
    evidence to contradict it.  But the appellant also  produces  a  letter
    from the sponsor's mother, written in excellent English and not said to
    be translated.  In the letter she praises  the  appellant  highly,  and
    says she has been talking to the appellant regularly on the  phone  for
    the last 4 years.  As the appellant is  of  Afghan  origin  and  now  a
    citizen  of  the  USA,  it  seems  unlikely  these  conversations  were
    conducted in Gaelic.

17. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside,  and  the
    following determination  is  substituted:  the  appeal,  as  originally
    brought by the appellant to the First-tier Tribunal, is dismissed.

18. No order for anonymity has been requested or made.
