For the Appellant:        Mr Tomor Bahja, instructed by Lords Solicitors
LLP
For the Respondent:   Mr Peter Deller, Specialist Appeals Team UKBA

Someone who is married to a person settled in the  United  Kingdom  but  who
only has discretionary leave to remain cannot, if his marriage  breaks  down
because of domestic violence, claim an entitlement to  indefinite  leave  by
analogy with paragraph 289A of the Immigration Rules.  There is no  unlawful
discrimination in terms of 'other status' under  Article  14  of  the  ECHR.
That the rule only benefits those given leave to enter or remain under  Part
8  of  HC  395  does  not  itself  engage  the  Convention,   although   the
circumstances of the marital breakdown may be relevant to the assessment  of
any Article 8 claim that removal would be disproportionate.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.  The appellant, a citizen of Colombia now aged 49, came to  this  country
as an illegal entrant on New Year's Eve  2001,  and  in  September  2004  he
applied for leave to remain on the basis of his marriage to a woman  settled
in the United Kingdom.  It took a long  time  for  this  application  to  be
decided,  but  eventually   the   appellant   was   granted   three   years'
discretionary leave to remain ('DLR').  As an illegal entrant,  he  was  not
eligible for two years' leave to remain as a  spouse  under  paragraphs  284
and 285 of the Immigration  Rules.   The  discretionary  leave  was  due  to
expire on 21 August 2010, but as early as 2007 the  marriage  had  begun  to
break down, and on 6 August 2010 the appellant applied for indefinite  leave
to remain ('ILR') on the basis that his marriage had been  caused  to  break
down because of domestic violence on the part of his wife.  The  application
was made on form  SET(M),  which  was  the  wrong  form.   It  is  used  for
applications where the marriage is  subsisting,  not  where  it  has  broken
down.

2.  The application was re-submitted on 2 September  on  form  SET(DV),  and
when a decision was made on 28 September 2010  to  refuse  the  application,
the appellant was told that, because his application  had  been  made  after
the expiry of his discretionary leave, he had no  right  of  appeal  against
the refusal of leave to remain.   An  appeal  was  lodged  nonetheless,  and
Immigration  Judge  Cockrill  resolved  the  jurisdictional  point  in   the
appellant's favour by holding that the initial application, which  had  been
made in time, was not invalid.  That decision,  we  observe,  is  wholly  in
keeping with the reasoning of Richards LJ in JH (Zimbabwe) [2009]  EWCA  Civ
78.

3.  Judge Cockrill also found that, contrary to  the  stance  taken  in  the
refusal letter of 28 September last, the  marital  relationship  had  indeed
been caused to break down permanently as  a  result  of  domestic  violence.
But he did not accept an "ingenious" argument advanced by Mr Bahja that  the
refusal of further (or indefinite) leave  to  remain  was  a  discriminatory
breach of the appellant's right  to  respect  for  his  private  life  under
Article 8, read with Article 14 of the ECHR.  The  discrimination  was  said
to arise from the fact that a person who is given leave to enter  or  remain
as a spouse under the Immigration Rules, and whose marriage breaks  down  as
a result of domestic violence during the 'probationary period', is  normally
granted ILR.  The appellant was in exactly  the  same  position,  argued  Mr
Bahja, save that he had not been given leave under  the  Immigration  Rules.
To discriminate against him on that basis was contrary  to  Article  14,  in
particular the ground of "other status"  -  none  of  the  specific  grounds
listed at Article 14 actually being in point.

4.  Judge Cockrill went on to observe  that  the  appellant's  marriage  was
already breaking down when DLR  was  granted  in  2007,  and  that  had  the
Secretary of State known about this, leave might not have  been  granted  at
all.  In any event, the judge reasoned, the appellant had lived most of  his
life in Colombia, his illegal status had been regularised only on the  basis
of a marriage which turned sour, and  although  the  decision  under  appeal
interfered with his private  life,  it  would  not  be  disproportionate  to
expect him to go back to Colombia.

5.  Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  initially  refused,  but
was granted on renewal, and before us Mr  Bahja  expanded  on  the  argument
which he ventilated before Judge Cockrill and subsequently  in  his  grounds
of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  He took us to  a  number  of  cases,  both
domestic and at the Strasbourg court,  which  he  thought  lent  support  by
analogy - there being no case directly in point.  We were  also  shown  that
part of the  Immigration  Directorate  Instructions  of  August  2010  which
guides  caseworkers  in  the  application  of  paragraphs  289A-C   of   the
Immigration Rules.  Mr Bahja presented his argument  very  attractively  and
persuasively, but in the end we agree with Mr Deller that there has been  no
unlawful discrimination in this  case.   Indeed,  we  regard  the  following
passage, taken from Senior Immigration Judge Waumsley's initial  refusal  of
leave, as summing the matter up rather succinctly.

      "It is in the very  nature  of  legitimate  immigration  control  that
      foreign nationals who can satisfy the requirements for leave to  enter
      or remain in the United Kingdom as laid down from time to time in  the
      Immigration Rules are  treated  more  favourably  than  those  foreign
      nationals who cannot.  There would be no purpose in attempting to have
      any form of immigration control if that were not the case.   The  fact
      that those foreign nationals who  can  satisfy  the  requirements  for
      leave to enter or remain are in a more favourable  position  vis-ï¿½-vis
      their immigration status than those who  cannot  manifestly  does  not
      constitute unlawful discrimination in breach of Article 14."

6.  Mr Bahja insisted that if the appellant had gone back to Colombia  after
getting  married,  and  had  applied  successfully  from  there  for   entry
clearance as a spouse, he would have got ILR  if  his  marriage  had  broken
down  before  the  end  of  the  probationary  period  because  of  domestic
violence.  But that does not make it unlawful  for  him  not  to  have  been
granted ILR.  He chose not to apply for entry  clearance  under  the  Rules,
but stayed on in the hope of getting leave to remain outwith the Rules.   Mr
Bahja did not  contend  that  DLR  has  a  discriminatory  effect  in  other
respects.  For example, discretionary  leave  normally  leads  to  ILR  only
after six years, and Mr Bahja was not saying that  it  should  lead  to  ILR
after two years, if it is based on marriage.  Nor was he saying that  it  is
unfair to have, as it were, a 'probationary  period'  of  six  years  rather
than two years  when  someone  who  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the
Immigration Rules is given leave on a discretionary basis.

7.  But it is exactly the same with the domestic violence  rule.   In  order
to come within its scope, a person must have been "admitted  to  the  United
Kingdom for a period not exceeding 27 months or given an extension  of  stay
for a period of 2 years as the spouse or civil partner of a  person  present
and  settled  here."   That  people  outside  this  category   are   treated
differently  does  not  constitute  unlawful  discrimination.    Immigration
control necessarily involves  treating  some  people  more  favourably  than
others.   British  citizens  are  generally  treated  more  favourably  than
foreigners, although nationals of other EU Member States are  in  some  ways
treated more favourably than  British  citizens  when  it  comes  to  family
reunion.  But none of that is unlawful.

8.  The history of the 'domestic violence concession' and  the  reasons  for
its  introduction  were  canvassed  at  the  hearing,  but  are  not  really
relevant.  The concession was introduced specifically to assist  women  from
the Indian  Subcontinent  who  entered  into  arranged  marriages  with  men
settled here and were subsequently mistreated.  They  often  felt  compelled
to stay in an  abusive  relationship  rather  than  go  back  to  their  own
country, where they would be regarded  as  having  brought  shame  on  their
family, and might be rejected.  Of course, the domestic violence  rule  also
benefits people who are not in that position.  The appellant is not in  that
position.  But that does not mean that he should have  the  benefit  of  the
domestic violence rule.

9.  We are far from saying that in an Article 8 appeal, the  fact  that  the
appellant's marriage broke down as a result of domestic violence  is  not  a
relevant factor in assessing the strength of his private life  ties  to  the
United Kingdom.  Just such an assessment was in fact carried  out  by  Judge
Cockrill.   At  paragraph  20  of  his  determination  he  looked   at   the
appellant's circumstances in the round, and specifically states that he  has
placed the domestic violence suffered by  the  appellant  "appropriately  in
the scales in looking  at  the  factors  that  speak  for  and  against  the
proportionality of the decision."  That, in our  judgment,  is  the  correct
approach.  Domestic violence is a relevant factor in an  Article  8  appeal,
but it will not necessarily lead  to  the  appeal  being  allowed,  although
required in an appeal under paragraphs  289A-C  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
But that is no different in principle from, say,  a  Tier  2  migrant  being
able to 'switch' to being a Tier 4 migrant, whereas someone who is  here  as
a visitor cannot change his status to that of student,  even  if  he  has  a
Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies from a licensed sponsor and  has  the
funds required by Appendix C.   The  latter  scenario  would  not  found  an
allegation of unlawful discrimination.

10.  We agree with Mr Deller that the appellant's position  as  someone  who
was an illegal entrant and was granted discretionary leave is not an  "other
status" in terms of Article 14 of the ECHR.  Nor is a person who  has  leave
under paragraph 284 and whose  marriage  breaks  down  because  of  domestic
violence an appropriate 'comparator'.  Discretionary leave simply  does  not
confer all the benefits of leave under the Rules.  That  is  not  unfair  or
discriminatory.  In respect of the First-tier decision under  appeal,  there
has been no error of law.


DECISION

11. The appeal is dismissed.
