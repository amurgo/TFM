       DETERMINATION AND REASONS FOR FINDING NO MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW


Introduction

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 7 March 1979.
2.   The appellant appeals  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  she  neither
    qualified under the Immigration Rules nor  satisfied  the  requirements
    for consideration outside those Rules under Article 8 of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  The decision, made on  19  February
    2014, was made by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett  (the  Immigration
    Judge) following a hearing at Birmingham on 23 January 2014.

3.   The appellant was given permission to appeal to this Tribunal by  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Landes.  Judge Landes considered that it was
    at least arguable that the appellant, who had been from her country  of
    origin for 23 years, had sufficiently strong  ties  here  to  make  the
    Immigration Judge's findings in that  respect  (at  paragraph  3.6-3.8)
    unsustainable.   The  judge  granting  permission  had  regard  to  the
    observations of the court in a case called Ogundimu  at  paragraph  24.
    The appellant appeared to have few ties with Sri Lanka having not  been
    in that country since she was aged 9.

4.   Directions were made for the parties to prepare for the Upper  Tribunal
    hearing on the basis that  no  supplementary  oral  evidence  would  be
    adduced  nor  written  documents  allowed  save  where  an  appropriate
    application was made under Rule  15.   On  24  March  2014  a  skeleton
    argument was submitted on the appellant's behalf and on the same day  a
    notice served pursuant to Rule  15(2A)(a)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  seeking  to  adduce  an  opinion  by  S  K
    Naganathan,  an  Indian  advocate  and  notary  dated  22  March  2014,
    suggesting  that  there  were  difficulties  in   the   appellant   re-
    establishing a right of residence in India.

The Hearing

5.   At the hearing  the  appellant  attended  represented  by  counsel,  Mr
    Palmer. The appellant had the benefit  of  a  Tamil  interpreter.   The
    hearing lasted approximately one hour.  Mr Palmer submitted that  based
    on the case of Edgehill [2014] EWCA Civ 402 it was questionable whether
    the provisions of Appendix ADE of the Immigration Rules applied to this
    application given that it was made on 28 June 2012.  The new provisions
    did not come into force until 9 July 2012.  Mr  Palmer  explained  that
    his client had been a  refugee  from  Sri  Lanka  departing  from  that
    country aged 9 and settling in India until 2009.  When left  India  she
    lost the right of residence there.  In this connection I  was  referred
    to the document at page 27 in the bundle of documents prepared for  the
    Tribunal hearing dated 13 October 2009, in which the Superintendent  of
    Police indicated that she was to  lose  her  status  of  refugee  being
    granted an exit permit.  Given her loss of status, it was  argued,  the
    Immigration Judge had been required to consider her ties to Sri  Lanka.
    Issues with regard to the extent of her ties  with  that  country  were
    equally pertinent to an Article 8 claim.  The question was whether  the
    appellant can or should be required to go back to India.  The test  was
    whether she had lost the ability to re-establish her ties  there.   She
    had been away for 23 years and it was submitted  that  the  case  would
    have fallen within paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Immigration Rules. As  I
    understood Mr Palmer's argument, in the  event  that  paragraph  276ADE
    (vi) did not apply, he suggested that his client ought to be treated as
    though it did, despite the fact that  her  application  had  been  made
    before the commencement of that provision into force.

6.   The respondent submitted that the appellant must have been  older  than
    9 when she left Sri Lanka having  been  born  on  7  March  1979.   She
    continued to maintain a connection with that country as the Immigration
    Judge had implicitly  found  at  paragraph  21  of  her  determination.
    Alternatively, the appellant could safely return to India.  There was a
    lack of evidence supporting her claim to losing status there.   As  her
    application had been made before 9 July 2012 the Secretary of State was
    not entitled to consider paragraph 276ADE and she would have to rely on
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  She  came
    here with a two year residence permit to study.  She could have had  no
    expectation that she would be given leave to remain indefinitely.   The
    Secretary of State's decision was not disproportionate but based on the
    evidence was the correct one.

7.   Mr Palmer submitted by reply that  it  was  not  right  to  reject  the
    Article 8 application even if it was accepted that  the  appellant  did
    not qualify under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

8.   At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision as to whether  or  not
    there was a material error of law.

Discussion

9.   The appellant came to the UK in  2009  as  a  student  for  an  initial
    period of two years.  However she ceased to study here in 2012 and made
    an application for further leave to remain on 26 June 2012,  which  was
    refused on 7 August 2013.  Therefore, as the "new" Rules did  not  come
    into force until 9 July 2012, her application was made  under  the  old
    Rules and she cannot rely on paragraph 276 ADE (vi).

10.  In any event, the present grounds of appeal  make  it  clear  that  the
    application before the respondent was made  "outside"  the  Immigration
    Rules (see paragraph 1.1 of the grounds).

11.  The appellant's circumstances were unusual.  She had left Sri Lanka  at
    the age of 9 and spent most of her life living in India with relatives.
     Mr Palmer's skeleton argument dated 22 January 2014 prepared  for  the
    First-tier Tribunal posed the question before  that  tribunal  in  this
    way: whether or not it would be proportionate to expect  the  appellant
    to leave the UK and return to a country (Sri Lanka) where she  had  not
    lived for 23 years in order to make an entry clearance application?  It
    was submitted on behalf of the appellant that it  was  disproportionate
    to expect her to do so having  regard  to  her  relationship  with  her
    partner Mr Maheswaran.

12.  It is important to note that  the  Immigration  Judge  found  that  the
    appellant had not  satisfied  the  burden  of  establishing  a  durable
    relationship with Mr Maheswaran of a strength  and  character  claimed.
    In particular she was  not  satisfied  that  the  parties  were  in  an
    intimate relationship as partner or fiancï¿½ of the other.  Therefore the
    appellant had not established any family life in the UK and had to rely
    solely  on the private life she had established in the UK in  the  four
    years or so since she arrived.  There appears to be no  appeal  against
    the  Immigration  Judge's  decision  on  the   relationship   with   Mr
    Maheswaran.

13.  In paragraph 19 of her determination the Immigration  Judge  approached
    the appeal as though it were to  be  determined  under  the  new  Rules
    rather than  the  old.   However,  neither  advocate  appears  to  have
    referred the Immigration Judge to the requirements of the old Rules and
    the application was argued on the basis that it was "outside" the Rules
    altogether this does not appear to have been a relevant error.

14.  The Immigration Judge concluded  that  there  was  no  disproportionate
    interference with the appellant's right to a private life under Article
    8 having regard to the fact that the appellant came to the UK  for  the
    purposes of a short period of study, she had not continued that course,
    and as an educated woman who had been to university in India  would  be
    able to continue her private life either there or in Sri  Lanka,  where
    she had family members living.

15.  The key basis of the challenge before the  Upper  Tribunal  relates  to
    the finding that the appellant could live in Sri Lanka having regard to
    the fact that she had only unidentified "family members" living  there.
    It is suggested that the relationship between other family  members  in
    India and family members in Sri Lanka was irrelevant and her only  real
    connection with Sri Lanka was the fact that she spoke Tamil,  was  born
    there and lived there until she was aged 9.  However, I note  that  the
    primary focus of the attack on the Immigration Judge's decision in  the
    grounds of appeal to this Tribunal relates to  the  appellant's  family
    connection with the LTTE.

16.  The respondent states that the appellant  had  the  burden  of  showing
    that she had  "no  ties"  to  Sri  Lanka  and  her  circumstances  were
    exceptional so as to bring her within current guidance on Article 8  in
    the case law.  The respondents submit that the  Immigration  Judge  was
    entitled to reach the view  she  did  and,  having  found  no  intimate
    relationship between the appellant and Mr Maheswaran, she was  entitled
    to conclude she had not lost her ties with Sri Lanka, having regard  to
    the fact that she had relatives there.

Conclusions

17.  The burden rested on the appellant to satisfy the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that she  ought  to  be  allowed  to  remain  in  the  UK  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  It was open to her to explore in greater detail her
    family ties with Sri Lanka.  The fact that her  family  may  have  LTTE
    connections has not been pursued before the Upper Tribunal as a  reason
    why the Immigration Judge should have allowed her appeal. The assertion
    in paragraph 14 of her grounds of appeal before the First-tier Tribunal
    that she had "no family or friends in Sri Lanka" was plainly not  borne
    out by her own witness statement (see paragraph 15).   The  Immigration
    Judge was entitled to make the finding that she  did  at  paragraph  21
    that there were family members to whom she  could  turn  in  Sri  Lanka
    there, albeit not close ones. The allegation that the appellant may  be
    at risk from her family's LTTE associations was not pursued before  the
    Upper Tribunal.

18.  The notes of cross-examination within the  Tribunal  file  also  record
    that the appellant was in daily contact with her family in  India,  yet
    she asserted in her evidence that she  had  "no  support  there."   The
    appellant was an adult.  The fact that her  Indian  relatives  were  in
    contact with her Sri Lankan relatives appears to be a  matter  of  some
    importance.  In this connection no good  reason  has   been  shown  for
    obtaining the Mr Naganathan's evidence so late and this evidence  ought
    to have been obtained much earlier if it was to be relied  on.  In  any
    event the issue before this Tribunal is :whether there was  a  material
    error in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and it is only   if  I
    find that there is that consideration  would  be  given  to  additional
    evidence that may be needed to re-make the decision.

19.  In addition, the  appellant's  economic  circumstances  were  far  from
    unfavourable.  She was an educated person  who  had  acquired  valuable
    skills in the UK. This combined with the  presence  of  relatives  with
    whom she might settle in Sri  Lanka  provided  sufficient  evidence  to
    support the finding that there would not be undue interference with the
    appellant's private life if she were required to return to  Sri  Lanka.
    The respondent would be able to justify such interference by  the  need
    for effective immigration control.

20.  In the circumstances the Immigration Judge  was  entitled  to  conclude
    that the appellant had  not  shown  that  she  fell  for  consideration
    outside the Immigration Rules.  Having failed to establish  any  family
    life in the UK the respondent  was  entitled  to  reach  the  view  the
    appellant could return to Sri Lanka and make any application for  entry
    clearance there. There appears to have been no material error of law in
    the Immigration Judge's approach.

My Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  a  material  error
of law and this appeal is  dismissed.   Accordingly,  the  decision  of  the
respondent to refuse further leave to remain stands.

No        anonymity        direction        has         been         sought.
