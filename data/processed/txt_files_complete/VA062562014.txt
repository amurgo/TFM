For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as  they  were
    in the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this  appeal  but
    in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in
    the First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Fowell  promulgated  on
    20 July 2015 which allowed the Appellant's appeal against the  decision
    of the Respondent to refuse her entry clearance as  a  general  visitor
    under Article 8 ECHR.

 4.  The  Sponsor  did  not  attend  the  hearing  nor  was  the  Appellant
    represented at the appeal. Solicitors representing the Appellant  wrote
    to the court and indicated that neither they nor the sponsor  would  be
    attending and they would be content for the matter to proceed in  their
    absence on the basis of the papers  already  served.   I  am  therefore
    satisfied that having  been  served  notice  of  the  hearing  and  not
    attended it is in the interests of justice to proceed with the  hearing
    in the Appellant's absence  as  I  am  entitled  to  do  by  virtue  of
    paragraph 38 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Background

 5. The Appellant was born on 12 April 1994 and was a national of Pakistan.

 6. On 21 August 2014 the Appellant applied for leave to enter the UK as  a
    general visitor in order to visit her father who was in  the  UK  as  a
    Tier 1 Investor together with her mother and siblings as dependents.

 7. On 3 September 2014 the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application under paragraph 41 (i) and (ii). The refusal letter gave  a
    number of reasons but in essence the refusal was on the basis that  the
    Appellants family was living in the  UK  and  the  Appellant  had  been
    refused a visa to enter the UK as her fathers dependent  and  therefore
    she had no ties that would result in her  returning  to  Pakistan;  the
    financial information sent in respect of  her  father  was  over  three
    months old; the  information  provided  did  not  make  clear  who  the
    Appellant was living with in Pakistan. The refusal letter  stated  that
    the Appellant had a right of appeal limited to those  grounds  referred
    to in section 84(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002. The Appellant raised human rights in her appeal.

The Judge's Decision

 8. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Fowell ("the Judge") allowed the appeal against the  Respondent's
    decision. The Judge :

      a) Set out the law and stated that the right of appeal was limited and
         included human rights.

      b) There was a witness statement from the Appellants  father  who  was
         unable to attend the hearing and he therefore  attached  relatively
         little weight to it. He stated that he was  a  wealthy  person  now
         living in the UK with his wife and 4 children the Appellant was his
         fifth child studying for a BA in Islamabad. His  family  wanted  to
         see the Appellant.

      c) The Appellant made a  statement  confirming  that  she  was  wholly
         supported by her father who had business interests in Pakistan  and
         she saw him from time to time. She had  not  seen  her  mother  and
         siblings for a long time and that was the purpose of the visit.

      d) A family friend Mr Hussain attended court and  confirmed  that  the
         Appellant just wanted to visit for the summer. The Appellant  lived
         in Pakistan with her uncle and had over �8000 in 3 accounts there.

      e) The Judge referred to the cases of  Mostafa  (Article  8  in  entry
         clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) and Adjei (visit visas-Article 8
         [2015] UKUT 0261(IAC).

      f) The Judge set out the provisions of  Article  8  and  the  guidance
         given in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

      g) The Judge found that the 'removal' (sic) would interfere  with  the
         Appellants family life; the consequences of the  interference  were
         sufficiently grave as to engage the operation of  Article  8  given
         her relative youth and the long separation  the family had endured;
         the interference was necessary in the public interest.

      h)  In  assessing  the  proportionality  of  the  decision  the  Judge
         considered whether the Appellant had met the  requirements  of  the
         Rules.  He  found  that  the  Appellants  evidence  had  not   been
         challenged and was credible. And that she intended to visit  for  a
         limited period and would leave at the end of her trip.

      i) The Judge found no countervailing factors under section 117B of the
         Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 9. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that  the  Judge  had  failed  to
    consider whether family life existed at all in this case given that the
    relationship was one between an adult child and her parents where there
    was no presumption that it existed  if  the  relationship  did  not  go
    beyond normal emotional ties; the Respondent referred to the caselaw on
    this issue such as Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31.

10. On 18 November 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies gave permission to
    appeal.

11. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Harrison on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent that he relied on the grounds of appeal.

The Law

12. The protection  provided  by  Article  8  does  not  cover  all  family
    relationships. In the case of Mostafa (which dealt with an  application
    for entry clearance as a visitor by a wife) at paragraph 24  the  court
    said

         "Thus we refrain from suggesting that, in this type  of  case,  any
         particular kind of relationship would always attract the protection
         of Article 8(1) or that other kinds  of  relationship  would  never
         come within its scope.  We are, however, prepared to  say  that  it
         will only be in very unusual circumstances that a person other than
         a close relative will be able to show that  the  refusal  of  entry
         clearance comes within the scope  of  Article  8(1).  In  practical
         terms this is likely to be limited to cases where the  relationship
         is that of husband and wife or  other  close  life  partners  or  a
         parent and minor child and even then it  will  not  necessarily  be
         extended to cases where, for example, the proposed visit  is  based
         on a whim or will not add significantly to the time that the people
         involved spend together." (my bold)

13. These principles were found in the earlier  case  of  Kugathas  a  case
    which concerned an adult's  relationship  with  his  mother  and  adult
    siblings, the Court of Appeal thought that the following passage in S v
    United Kingdom [1984] 40 DR 196 was still relevant:

         "... generally, the protection  of  family  life  under  Article  8
         involves cohabiting dependants, such as parents and their dependent
         minor children.  Whether it extends to other relationships  depends
         on the circumstances of the particular case.  Relationships between
         adults ... would not necessarily acquire the protection of  Article
         8 of  the  Convention  without  evidence  of  further  elements  of
         dependency, involving more than the normal emotional ties."

14. However, the Court of Appeal considered that  the  further  element  of
    dependency did not have to be economic.  Accordingly, in  the  case  of
    the "other relationships" referred to, it will  be  necessary  to  show
    that ties of support, either emotional or economic,  are  in  existence
    and go beyond the ordinary and natural ties  of  affection  that  would
    accompany a relationship of that kind.

The Law

Finding on Material Error

15. Having heard those submissions,  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made a material error of law.

16. While the Judge correctly set out the law  and  the  questions  he  was
    bound to address where Article 8 was in issue he failed to address  and
    give reasons for why he accepted that family life existed in this  case
    given that this was an adult Appellant in Pakistan and her parents  and
    siblings in the UK. No factual findings were made  to  demonstrate  the
    basis on which the Judge asserted in paragraph  18.1  of  the  decision
    that family life existed.

17. The failure of the First-tier Tribunal to address and determine whether
    family life exited between the adult Appellant and her family in the UK
    constitutes a clear error of law. This error I consider to be  material
    since had the Tribunal conducted this exercise the outcome  could  have
    been different. That in my view is the correct test to apply.

18. I therefore found that errors of law have been established and that the
    Judge's determination cannot  stand  and  must  be  set  aside  in  its
    entirety and I remake the decision.

Remaking the Decision.

19. This was an application for entry clearance as a general visitor by the
    Appellant who wished to visit her family who are  currently  living  in
    the UK as  the  father  is  a  Tier  1  Investor  with  his  family  as
    dependents.

20. I am satisfied that there is no presumption that a person has a  family
    life, even with the members of a person's immediate family.  The  court
    has to scrutinise the relevant factors.  In relation to  the  issue  of
    family life I could have course  have  considered  oral  evidence  from
    family members. Given the importance of the relationship to  the  facts
    in issue I am very troubled by the fact  that  neither  the  Appellants
    father who is the sponsor or her mother attended court  in  the  First-
    tier or before me to give evidence in support of her appeal.

21. The Appellant is 20 years old so in law is an adult. She  is  attending
    University and lives with another family member, an uncle in Islamabad.
    The Appellants parents have been  living  in  the  UK  since  2013  and
    therefore by choice the family have lived  apart  since  then.  Whether
    they were living together prior to 2013 I am unable determine as  there
    is no evidence relating to it on file. While  there  is  of  course  no
    prohibition on the family seeing the Appellant in Pakistan  she  states
    in her witness statement that she only sees her father  'from  time  to
    time' but has not seen her mother and siblings since February 2013 when
    they came to the UK. There was no evidence of any other form of contact
    before me; no evidence of contact  by  letter,  telephone  or  via  the
    internet.

22. While the Appellants asserted in her  visa  application  that  she  was
    dependent on her father no evidence of financial dependency, or  indeed
    any other form of  dependency,  was  provided.  The  evidence  produced
    showed that the father had funds in the UK but there  was  no  evidence
    that any was sent  to  the  Appellant.  There  was  evidence  that  the
    Appellant had funds in her own name, the equivalent of over  �8000  and
    while it is possible the funds  came  from  her  father  there  was  no
    documentary or oral evidence to establish that before me.

23. On the basis of the evidence before me that the Appellant is  an  adult
    student who has her own funds and has  not  demonstrated  that  she  is
    financially supported by her family and has had  very  limited  contact
    with her father and none with her mother and siblings for 3  years  the
    Appellants has failed to meet the  evidential  burden  of  establishing
    that her relationship extends beyond the normal emotional  ties  of  an
    adult child and her parents.

Decision

24. I set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
    material error of law. I substitute the following decision:

25. This appeal is also dismissed on human rights grounds (Article 8)
