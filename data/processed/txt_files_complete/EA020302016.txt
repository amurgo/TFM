               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Uddin of counsel instructed by OTS Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Ghana, date of birth 7 June 1980  appealed
    against the Respondent's decision, dated 29 January 2016, to  refuse  a
    residence card with reference to Regulation 10, particularly Regulation
    15, of the 2006 Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006
    (the 2006 Regulations).  On 23 May 2018 I concluded that  the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian, who had  dismissed  the  appeal,
    made a number of errors of law and in  the  result  directed  that  the
    matter should be remade in the Upper Tribunal.

2.   At the hearing today the issues have been  significantly  clarified  in
    that with Mr Clarke's help  and  Mr  Uddin's  assistance  it  has  been
    established that the five year period required was established  because
    the evidence was produced. An examination of the PAYE returns, as  also
    the self-employed earnings returns to  HMRC,  it  was  clear  that  the
    Appellant was not carrying out employment  in  a  marginal  or  minimal
    level but rather was seeking to make his living through those earnings.
     It was clear without necessary to recite them that the evidence showed
    the employment  periods  in  the  years  2011/2012  and  2012/2013  and
    earnings which were not insignificant. There was no issue, in the  end,
    whether or not they were  sufficient  to  establish  him  as  a  person
    exercising rights.

3.   Accordingly, it was also helpfully agreed that in fact the refusal  was
    with reference to Regulation 15(1)(b) which stated "A family member  of
    an EEA national who is not himself an EEA national but who has  resided
    in the UK with the EEA national in association with  these  Regulations
    for a continuous period of  five  years"  is  the  relevant  Regulation
    rather than  as  stated  elsewhere  Regulation  15(1)(f)  of  the  2006
    Regulations.  Accordingly, there is no other issue taken that  a  right
    of residence had not been acquired. The  Original  Tribunal's  decision
    having been set aside the following decision is substituted.

NOTICE OF DECISION
The appeal is allowed under the 2006 Regulations.
No anonymity direction is made.

Signed                                  Date 2 November 2018

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appeal has succeeded on the basis of the evidence originally  submitted.
 In those circumstances I can see no reason why a fee award in  the  sum  of
ï¿½140 should not be made.

Signed                                  Date 2 November 2018

 P.S.  Before the 2 November 2018 I last saw  this  case  file  on  26  July
    2018. I do not know how  the  unfortunate  delay  has  been  caused  to
    promulgation which I regret.
