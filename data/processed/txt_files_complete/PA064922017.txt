Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Uddin of Counsel instructed by Irvine, Thanvi
Nata Sols.

For the Respondent:    Mr Bates Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo.
    There are references in the papers to the children  of  the  appellant.
    Taking that into account I consider it appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Herwald. By the decision promulgated on 21st August 2017
    Judge Herwald dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision  of
    the respondent to refuse him asylum, humanitarian protection or  relief
    otherwise on human rights grounds either under  Articles  2  and  3  or
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The date of the decision by the respondent was  23  June  2017  and  is
    headed Decision to Refuse a Protection and Human Rights Claim.

 4. By decision dated 15 September  2017  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M  J
    Gillespie granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Thus  the
    matter appeared before me to determine in the first instance whether or
    not there is a material error of law in the decision.

 5. The grounds of the appeal raised two principal matters:-

      i) The fact that the judge refused the appellant an adjournment.

     ii) The fact that the judge, having refused the adjournment, has failed
         to take account of relevant  matters,  whereby  the  appellant  was
         prevented from properly presenting his case, and taken  account  of
         irrelevant matters in assessing the rights of the appellant.

Background chronology

 6. The appellant was born in September 1983 in the DRC.  He  came  to  the
    United Kingdom with his parents arriving on 3 August 1989 when  he  was
    aged 5 years old. At that stage his parents  claimed  asylum  but  that
    claim was refused on 27 September 1991.

 7. The parents thereafter made application for leave to  remain  but  this
    was refused in January 1992. Accordingly the family were in the  United
    Kingdom without any valid leave.

 8. On 20 August 1996 the appellant's mother  claimed  asylum  in  her  own
    right with her children as dependants. That claim was  refused  in  May
    2000. However the family were at that stage granted discretionary leave
    to remain until 30 May 2004.

 9. Whilst the mother's claim for asylum was  pending,  the  appellant  was
    involved in a number of criminal offences:

      i) 30  September  1999  Haringey  Youth  Court-for  using  threatening
         abusive and insulting words  or  behaviour  to  cause  of  fear  or
         provocation of violence-the appellant  was  ordered  to  attend  an
         attendance centre.

     ii) 7 October 1999-Haringey Juvenile  Court-  allowing  himself  to  be
         carried  on  a  conveyance   taken   without   authority-12   month
         conditional discharge and �10 costs.

    iii) 17 February  2000  Haringey  Magistrates  Court-aggravated  vehicle
         taking and using threatening and  abusive  words  and  behaviour-18
         month supervision  order  and  disqualified  from  driving  for  12
         months.

     iv) 30 March 2000 Haringey Magistrates Court-interfering with  a  motor
         vehicle, taking a conveyance without authority  and  breaching  his
         conditional discharge- 18 hours at an attendance centre.

      v) 13 July 2000 Haringey Magistrates Court-possessing a bladed article
         in public and failing to surrender  to  bail-12  month  conditional
         discharge and 12 months it had an attendance centre.

     vi) 14 September 2000 Haringey Juvenile Court-theft, being carried on a
         motor vehicle  taken  without  consent,  failing  to  surrender  to
         custody,  driving  whilst  disqualified,  destroying  or   damaging
         property, driving without insurance and  failing  to  surrender  to
         bail received 4 months detention and training order, fined �25  and
         disqualified for 12 months and his licence was endorsed.

    vii) 5 April 2001  Haringey  Juvenile  Court-  taking  a  motor  vehicle
         without consent, driving whilst disqualified  and  driving  without
         insurance - 18 month Community Rehabilitation Order and his licence
         was endorsed.

   viii) 15 January 2002 Barnet Magistrates Court resisting or obstructing a
         constable find �100.

     ix) 25 February 2002 Harrow Crown Court- burglary and theft- 18  months
         in a young offenders' institution.

      x) 19 August 2003 Haringey Magistrates Court- possession of a class  B
         controlled drug cannabis- find �30.

     xi) 21 July 2004  Horseferry  Road  Magistrates  Court-  destroying  or
         damaging property, assaulting a constable and criminal damage-  100
         hours community punishment order.

    There are further offences  recorded  against  the  appellant  as  more
    particularly appear  hereafter.  Whilst  in  respect  of  many  of  the
    offences the appellant would have been a minor, certainly from  January
    2002 onwards he was over 18 years old.

10. On 9 November 2004,  separately  from  the  rest  of  his  family,  the
    appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
    This appears to have been granted on 11 August 2005.

11. The appellant at the time had acquired a number of further  convictions
    before leave was granted and there were a number  of  convictions  post
    the granting of leave: -

      i) On 6  April  2005-Highbury  Corner  Magistrates  Court  failing  to
         surrender to custody-7 days imprisonment.

     ii) 27 January 2006 Wood Green Crown Court burglary and theft-21 months
         imprisonment.

    iii) 9 March 2006 Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court handling stolen goods-
         3 months imprisonment.

     iv)  18  August  2006-Middlesex  Crown  Court  one   count   of   false
         imprisonment and one count of blackmail- 5 years imprisonment.

12. By the time of the offences the appellant was over 21 years old. On  31
    October 2007 a notice of the decision to make a deportation  order  was
    served on the appellant whilst he was in detention.

13. On 1 November 2007 the appellant lodged an appeal against the decision.
    His appeal was heard and dismissed on 17  July  2008.  A  copy  of  the
    decision it is enclosed in the  papers.  The  appellant  became  appeal
    rights exhausted as of 25 July 2008. On 8 October  2008  the  appellant
    was served with  a  signed  deportation  order.  It  appears  that  the
    appellant after completing his criminal  sentence  was  detained  under
    immigration powers. The appellant appears to have been detained on more
    than one occasion under immigration powers and to  have  been  detained
    for significant periods of time.

14. On 25 March 2010 the appellant submitted a Pre-Action  Protocol  letter
    challenging  the  decision  to  remove  him  and  requesting  that  his
    indefinite leave to remain be reinstated.  By  the  1  April  2010  the
    respondent had rejected that request and  maintained  the  decision  to
    deport the appellant.

15. On 27 May 2010 the  appellant  lodged  a  judicial  review  application
    against that decision. Permission to pursue  the  judicial  review  was
    refused and on 23 June 2010 at an oral  hearing  permission  was  again
    refused. 2nd July 2010 the appellant confirmed that he was not renewing
    his claim for judicial review.

16. On 12 October 2010 the appellant lodged further submissions challenging
    the decision to deport him from the United Kingdom.

17.  On  21  September  2011  the  appellant  was  convicted  at   Uxbridge
    Magistrates Court of common  assault  and  was  sentenced  to  5  weeks
    imprisonment.

18. On 7 March 2012 the appellant submitted further submissions challenging
    his removal. Whilst those were  refused,  it  appears  that  they  were
    treated as an application to  revoke  the  deportation  order  and  the
    appellant was given an in country right of appeal against the  decision
    to refuse to  revoke  the  deportation  order.  On  26  June  2012  the
    appellant's appeal against the refusal to revoke the deportation  order
    was dismissed. By 6 July 2012 the appellant  was  again  appeal  rights
    exhausted. In the respondent's bundle  of  documents  for  the  present
    hearing are the documents submitted in support of  the  appeal  against
    the  refusal  to  revoke  the  deportation  decision,  which   includes
    statements from 2 of the sisters of the appellant, one of  whom  wished
    to give evidence.

19. Whilst initially the appellant was represented  by  Fadiga  &  Co  that
    representation seems to have changed and he was  later  represented  by
    Broudie, Jackson, Canter.

20. There is in the respondent's bundle a  large  amount  of  documentation
    from the previous appeals. It is clear at that stage that the appellant
    was seeking in part to rely  upon  both  protection  issues  and  human
    rights issues in  seeking  to  originally  defend  the  making  of  the
    deportation order proceedings and subsequently applying to  revoke  the
    deportation order.

21. On 31  August  2012  an  application  was  made  for  emergency  travel
    documents to  enable  the  appellant's  removal  to  the  DRC.  Pending
    obtaining the emergency travel documents  the  appellant  was  released
    from immigration detention.

22. On 1 February 2013  the  appellant  lodged  further  submissions  again
    challenging the decision to remove him.

23. On 2 December 2013 the appellant was re-detained to enable an interview
    to  take  place  again  with  a  view  to  obtaining  emergency  travel
    documents. The interview was set for 12 December 2013.

24. On 4 December 2013 the appellant's further submissions, from 1 February
    2013, were refused. The appellant was served with the  refusal  at  his
    detained location.

25. On 11 December 2013, 16 December 2013 and 13 January 2014 the appellant
    lodged further submissions challenging his removal.

26. On 27 January 2014 the appellant was again  released  from  immigration
    detention.

27. On 3 September 2014 the appellant lodged additional further submissions
    challenging the decision to deport him.

28. On 4  September  2014  valid  emergency  travel  documents  [ETD]  were
    obtained from the DRC officials in Kinshasa and a valid ETD was  issued
    which was valid until 22 February 2015.

29. On 2 August 2016 the  ETD's  were  revalidated  and  extended  until  2
    February 2017.

30. On 23 June 2017 the appellant's further  submissions  for  asylum  were
    refused. It is that refusal that gives rise to the current appeal.  The
    grounds of appeal  appear  to  have  been  settled  by  the  solicitors
    Broudie, Jackson and Canter and  appear  to  have  been  faxed  to  the
    Tribunal on 6 July 2017. The appeal was listed to be heard on 10 August
    2017 with the preliminary hearing set for 27 July 2017.  The  appellant
    failed to attend the preliminary hearing of 27 July and  there  was  no
    representative for the appellant in attendance either.

31. There is a letter from Broudie, Jackson and Canter dated 10  July  2017
    indicating that now their work for  the  appellant  was  complete,  his
    paper would be stored and kept for 6 years. Whilst  I  appreciate  that
    there were ongoing family and High Court proceedings, there appears  to
    be no explanation as to why the  solicitors  were  not  acting  in  the
    continued immigration proceedings.

32. By letter dated 3 August  the  appellant  applied  for  an  adjournment
    principally on the basis that he could not find  legal  representation.
    That application was refused.

33. By letter dated the 4 August 2017 the appellant indicated that  he  was
    relying upon the following documents:-

      i) his statement

     ii) the birth certificates of 3 of his children

    iii) Letters from the Congo embassy

     iv) Home Office letters from 2009 and 2011

      v) letters to work preparation team with response

     vi) letters from Liverpool Family Court

    vii) further letters to the Home Office

   viii) High Court correspondence

     ix) request for an adjournment

      x) Letters from Broudie Jackson and Canter.

34. There was no indication that  any  other  members  of  the  appellant's
    family were to give evidence. The appellant attended for the hearing on
    10 August 2017 and renewed his application  for  an  adjournment.  That
    application was refused.

35. It is quite evident from the history of this matter that the  appellant
    has been making further  submissions  to  the  Respondent  and  to  the
    Tribunal throughout. He  has  had  a  full  hearing  of  his  claim  to
    international protection and his  human  rights  on  2  occasions.  The
    issues therein have been canvassed fully and have been dealt with.

36. However where the respondent makes an  immigration  decision,  even  if
    that is the 3rd in a series, an appellant is entitled to appeal against
    that decision and have that appeal case fairly and justly  dealt  with.
    It has to be noted that it is as a result of  the  further  submissions
    made by the appellant that that further appeal arises. It was  for  the
    appellant to submit the evidence to substantiate that  since  the  last
    decision  the  circumstances  have  so  materially  changed  that   the
    appellant is now entitled to the relief sought.

37. In argument before me the appellant's representative  sought  to  argue
    that the appellant would be prejudiced by reason of the  fact  that  he
    would not understand the principles set out in  Devaseelan  2002  UKAIT
    00702. The effect of the case law cited is that the previous  decisions
    would be the starting point, unless further evidence had been submitted
    to bring into question the findings  of  fact  made.  As  the  previous
    decisions would be the starting point the judge would be building  upon
    those previous decisions in considering what changes  had  occurred  to
    the  circumstances  of  the  appellant  of  the  circumstances  in  the
    appellant's home  country  that  brought  into  question  the  previous
    findings. The evidence that the appellant was seeking to rely upon  and
    submit related to his family members in the United Kingdom. He had  had
    ample opportunity to call those witnesses in the past hearings. The one
    change in the situation was that the appellant was seeking allegedly to
    rely upon his partner or  girlfriend  to  give  evidence  but  she  was
    allegedly too ill to do  so.  However  no  medical  evidence  had  been
    produced in respect of the lady, no statements and indeed  even  before
    me in the Upper Tribunal there was no medical  evidence  or  statement.
    Indeed there was no  further  evidence  submitted  on  the  appellant's
    behalf not application to admit such evidence.

38. The appellant has claimed that his previous legal representatives  gave
    him notice that they were not going to act for him as of  10  July.  By
    the time of the application of 10 August there is no evidence that  the
    appellant had taken any steps to obtain further  legal  representation.
    As stated the appellant had made  an  application  for  an  adjournment
    which had been refused prior to the hearing itself.

39. On the day of the hearing and on the case being called on the appellant
    indicated that he wanted an adjournment in order to enable him to  call
    his mother and siblings. In part the reason given for not being able to
    call his mother was that she was working. Whilst it does not appear  on
    the face of the decision it is certainly recorded when it was  examined
    the mother appeared to be working in a school as a dinner lady  and  it
    was holiday time. No explanation has been given why the  appellant  did
    not  have  letters  or  statements  from  the   individuals   concerned
    explaining why they could not attend. There had  been  statements  from
    some of his siblings in the past.

    Legal framework

40. In exercising the power to grant an adjournment Rule 2  and  4  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014 are relevant. They provide: -

         2   Overriding objective and parties' obligations to cooperate with
         the Tribunal

         (1)      The overriding objective of these Rules is to  enable  the
         Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly.

         (2)      Dealing with the case fairly and justly includes-

             a)  dealing with the case in ways which are  proportionate  to
             the importance of the case, the complexity of the issues,  the
             anticipated cost and the resources of the parties and  of  the
             Tribunal;

             b)  avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking flexibility  in
             the proceeding;

             c)  ensuring, so far as is practical,  that  the  parties  are
             able to participate fully in the proceeding;

             d)  using any special expertise of the  Tribunal  effectively;
             and

             e)   avoiding  delay,  so  far  as  compatible   with   proper
             consideration of the issues.

         4  Case management powers

         (1)      Subject to the provisions of the 2007 Act  and  any  other
         enactment, the Tribunal may regulate its own procedure.

         (2)      The Tribunal may give  a  direction  in  relation  to  the
         conduct or  disposal  of  proceedings  at  any  time,  including  a
         direction  amending,  suspending  or  setting  aside   an   earlier
         direction

         (3)      In particular, and without restricting the general  powers
         in paragraphs (1) and (2), the Tribunal may-...

             (h)       adjourn or postpone a hearing

         ...

41.  The  appellant's  representatives  are  seeking  to  assert  that   in
    accordance with the overriding objective the case could not be  decided
    justly and fairly.  The appellant's representatives seek to  rely  upon
    the case of Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418.  It  has
    to be noted that the case is  based  upon  the  2005  Procedure  Rules.
    However it is suggested that the principles set out  in  the  case  are
    applicable in the present case.

42. In Nwaigwe the representatives of the appellant's  representatives  had
    written to the Tribunal indicating that the appellant was ill and could
    not attend the hearing. The judge had heard the appeal but in so  doing
    had considered whether there was good reason to  adjourn  and  not  the
    element of whether the appeal could be  fairly  and  justly  determined
    [see paragraph 10]. The judge  had  accordingly  failed  to  apply  the
    dominant test of fairness and had misdirected himself.

43. In the present circumstances the issue of whether to adjourn or not was
    considered by Judge Herwald in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the  decision.  The
    judge satisfied himself that there was no good legal reason to  adjourn
    the case. The appellant had had ample time that the case in  order,  to
    ensure that he was represented and to ensure  that  witnesses  attended
    the Tribunal.

44. Even by the hearing before me there were still no statements  from  the
    witnesses and it was still being asserted that the appellant's  partner
    was too ill to attend.

45. Judge Herwald properly  considered  the  issues  and  was  entitled  to
    conclude in the circumstances that there was no  good  reason  why  the
    appellant could not  have  obtained  legal  representation  before  the
    hearing and in any event there was no reason why  the  witnesses  could
    not have submitted statements in support of the  appellant's  case.  In
    the  circumstances  there  was  no  good  reason   for   granting   the
    adjournment.

46. Further the judge considered  whether  or  not  case  could  be  justly
    decided was satisfied that the case could  be  justly  decided  on  the
    basis of the evidence before him. The judge has considered  whether  or
    not he could justly deal with the appeal and was satisfied that it  was
    just to deal with the appeal on the basis  of  the  evidence  thus  far
    lodged including  the  papers  that  had  previously  been  before  the
    Tribunal.

47. In the circumstances the judge was entitled to proceed with the hearing
    in the manner that he did. There is no material error  of  law  in  the
    decision.

48. With regard to the second ground of appeal, it was accepted  that  that
    was dependent upon finding that the appellant  had  not  had  a  proper
    opportunity of preparing his case by  reason  of  the  refusal  of  the
    adjournment. In the circumstances I have considered the 2nd  ground  of
    appeal but find that the judge has acted upon  the  evidence  that  was
    before him was entitled to make the findings of fact that he did. There
    is therefore no error of law in the judge's approach to the evidence.

49. For the reasons set out there is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision.

    Notice of Decision

    I dismiss the appeal.
