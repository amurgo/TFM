                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane in which he allowed the appeal of Mr
    Kassa, a citizen of Ethiopia, against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision to refuse to grant leave to enter as a family visitor. I shall
    refer to Mr Kassa as the Applicant, although he was  the  Appellant  in
    the proceedings below.

 2. The Applicant applied for entry clearance as a  family  visitor  on  22
    October 2013. His application was refused on  20  December  2013.   The
    Applicant exercised his right of appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    This is the appeal which came before Judge Keane on 5 December 2014 and
    was allowed by virtue of Article 8 ECHR. The Secretary of State applied
    for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The  application  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta on 13 February 2015 in the
    following terms

         "The grounds of the Application were that  the  IJ  had  failed  to
         identify the correct basis of the appeal, made a material error  on
         the ambit of ï¿½ 41 of the  Immigration  Rules  where  the  right  to
         appeal was limited by s.84 (1) (c) of the Nationality,  Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002. The  IJ  had  used  Article  8  as  a  general
         dispensing power to override the criteria of the Immigration  Rules
         and limitation on the right of appeal.

         The evidence before the Court showed that  the  Appellant  did  not
         meet the criteria of the Immigration Rules, the  limited  right  of
         appeal was granted but the IJ did not apply  the  correct  approach
         and limit the ambit of the appeal. The reasons given for  the  IJ's
         decision amount to a decision  that  refusal  interfered  with  the
         family life of the Appellant and Sponsor, but  without  considering
         the balancing exercise necessary and  permitted  interference  with
         family rights, which the Appellant and Sponsor had not exercised in
         the United Kingdom before, or the fact  that  they  could  exercise
         family life elsewhere if they chose.

         The Determination discloses an  arguable  material  error  of  law.
         There is merit to the application."

 3. At the hearing before me Mr Mills appeared to represent  the  Secretary
    of State and Mr McGarvey represented  the  Applicant  and  submitted  a
    written skeleton argument. A section  24  response  was  filed  by  the
    Applicant dated 21 May 2015.

Background

 4.  The  history  of  this  appeal  is  detailed  above.  The  facts,  not
    challenged, are that the Applicant was born in Ethiopia on 28  November
    1977. He is married to the Sponsor, Naomi  Cantor,  who  is  a  British
    citizen. The application for entry clearance was  made  on  22  October
    2013 to the British Embassy in Stockholm as the Applicant was  resident
    in Sweden where he was studying  for  an  LL.M  in  Human  Rights.  The
    application showed that the Applicant intended to travel on 22 December
    2013 and a detailed statement submitted with the application  explained
    that he wished to spend Christmas with the Sponsor and her  parents  Mr
    and Mrs Geoffrey Cantor.

 5. The Applicant had  a  significant  immigration  history  and  had  been
    refused entry clearance as  a  visitor  previously.  This  history  was
    referred to in the detailed statement submitted  with  the  application
    and although this statement was referred  to  in  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's refusal the application was refused on  the  basis  that  the
    Applicant had used  deception  on  a  previous  occasion.  The  refusal
    referred to paragraph 320(7B) of  HC395  and  stated  that  any  future
    applications would automatically be refused until 31 October 2021.

 6. At the First-tier Tribunal hearing the Entry Clearance Officer was  not
    represented. The Sponsor and Mr and Mrs  Cantor  were  present  on  the
    Applicant's behalf. The Judge heard evidence from all three and  having
    done so made findings of fact detailed at paragraphs 6  and  7  of  his
    decision. This findings included a specific finding (see  paragraph  7)
    that the Applicant did  not  use  deception  and  did  not  make  false
    representations in the application for entry clearance that was refused
    in Nairobi on 31 October 2011. Having made  these  findings  the  Judge
    considered and allowed the appeal by virtue of Article 8 ECHR.

 7. The grounds of appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  do  not  challenge  the
    findings of fact  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  They  assert  a
    material  misdirection  of  law  by  the  making   of   an   inadequate
    proportionality assessment. The grounds assert that the Judge was wrong
    to find that the decision under  appeal  interfered  with  family  life
    within the meaning of Article 8, that the decision does  not  interfere
    with the established pattern of family life and that the  Judge  failed
    to explain adequately why preventing the Applicant  and  Sponsor  being
    together temporarily was a disproportionate interference with Article 8
    rights.

Submissions

 8. On behalf the Secretary of State Mr Mills said that he could  not  rely
    on all of the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal and added that he
    did not suggest that the decision  was  perverse.  It  was  clear  that
    family life existed and that the Entry Clearance Officer  had  accepted
    that the decision  constituted  a  limited  interference  however  such
    interference was not of sufficient gravity  to  engage  Article  8.  No
    adequate reasons had been given for the finding  that  the  refusal  of
    Entry Clearance for a two week visit was of such gravity as  to  engage
    the Convention. Article 8 was being used a general dispensing power and
    this was a misdirection in law.

 9. Having read the skeleton argument I did not ask Mr McGarvey to  address
    me. I said that there was no error of law revealed and  I  reserved  my
    written decision.

Error of law

10. The  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  assert  a  material
    misdirection in law and, as accepted by Mr Mills,  do  not  assert  any
    perversity in the decision.

11. Dealing with the grounds as put forward paragraphs 3 - 5 do not advance
    any argument at all. There is the statement that if  family  life  does
    not exist then Article 8 will not be engaged. That is  a  statement  of
    the obvious but there is no suggestion in this case  that  family  life
    does not exist. Paragraphs 4 and 5 are mere statements of  disagreement
    with the Judge's decision as are paragraph 7 and 8. The  only  part  of
    the grounds which can in reality be seen as a challenge of any sort  to
    the decision is paragraph 6. This  suggests  that  the  proportionality
    assessment is inadequate because it does not explain why the refusal of
    a visa which only allows the parties to be together  temporarily  is  a
    disproportionate interference with their Article 8 rights  adding  that
    there is no assessment as to why the Sponsor cannot visit the Applicant
    in Sweden or a third country.

12. An examination of the decision  clearly  demonstrates  the  fallacy  of
    these arguments. In the first place there can  be  no  doubt  that  the
    Judge was aware that the grounds of appeal were limited  to  the  Human
    Rights Convention. At the outset  of  his  decision  (paragraph  1)  he
    states

         "At the hearing I was solely concerned to resolve the issue whether
         the respondent's  decision  to  refuse  to  grant  entry  clearance
         engaged the United Kingdom's obligations and the appellant's rights
         under the Human Rights Convention".

    The Judge goes on to examine in detail  the  contentions  of  both  the
    Entry Clearance Officer and the Applicant as well as the  evidence  and
    the submissions put forward at the hearing.

13. The recent decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Adjei  (visit  visas  -
    Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261 (IAC) emphasises that the first question to
    be addressed in a visitor appeal where only human  rights  grounds  are
    available is whether Article 8 is engaged at all.  Where,  as  in  this
    instance, the Judge finds that Article 8 is engaged

         "... the Tribunal will need to look at  the  extent  to  which  the
         claimant is said to have failed to meet  the  requirements  of  the
         rule  because  that  will  inform  the  proportionality   balancing
         exercise that must follow".

    The clear ratio of Adejie is  that  where  Article  8  is  not  engaged
    compliance with the Immigration  Rules  is  not  an  issue  before  the
    Tribunal. Where it is engaged compliance with the rules is  capable  of
    being a weighty factor that must be assessed.

14. In making his findings of fact  the  Judge  examines  the  reasons  for
    refusal. He was clearly correct to do  so.  Whereas  this  was  not  an
    Immigration Rules appeal Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]
    UKUT 00112 (IAC) is authority for the proposition

         "... that the underlying merits of an application and  the  ability
         to satisfy the Immigration Rules, although not the question  before
         the Tribunal, may be capable of being a weighty factor in an appeal
         based on human rights but they will not be determinative."

15. In this case the Judge having made findings of fact that deal with  the
    question of whether the Applicant satisfied  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules goes on to explain why Article 8 is engaged. In doing
    so he goes through the Razgar [2004] INLR 349 HL criteria (paragraph 8)
    and finds that there is family  life  and  that  the  interference  has
    consequences of such gravity to  engage  Article  8.   In  making  this
    assessment the Judge refers specifically to the  fact  that  the  visit
    proposed was one of only two weeks  but  it  is  also  clear  that  his
    decision was informed by the fact that underlying the decision was  the
    Respondent's assertion that  the  Applicant  would  be  prevented  from
    visiting the United Kingdom until 2021.

16. The assertion that  the  Judge's  reasoning  is  inadequate  either  in
    respect of the gravity  of  the  interference  or  in  respect  of  the
    proportionality balancing exercise is, quite simply, not made out.  The
    reasoning is detailed clear and comprehensive. There is no error of law
    disclosed.

17. Finally it is perhaps  pertinent  to  comment  upon  the  Secretary  of
    State's assertion that the Judge used Article 8 as a general dispensing
    power to override the criteria of the Immigration Rules and  limitation
    on the right of  appeal.  This  is  in  my  judgement  an  ill  founded
    assertion. In the first place where an Appellant meets the criteria  of
    the Immigration Rules, even where  their  is  no  right  of  appeal,  a
    decision made that an Appellant meets  those  criteria  cannot  by  any
    stretch of the imagination be to override those rules. As recognised in
    Mostafa it may well be  pertinent  to  the  Article  8  proportionality
    decision to examine whether an Appellant meets the requirements of  the
    rules and, where he does it may well  be  a  weighty  factor.  Secondly
    where Article 8 is engaged it is perverse to assert that  by  so  doing
    the Tribunal is in some way overriding the limitation on the  right  of
    appeal. Where an applicant meets the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules his application  should  be  granted.  Entry  Clearance  Officers
    should not use the limitation on the right of appeal to avoid  granting
    entry clearance to applicants who meet the requirements of the rules.

18. My conclusion from all of the above is that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal contains no error of law  material  to  the  decision  to
    allow the appeal. The appeal of the Secretary  of  State  is  therefore
    dismissed.

Summary

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of a
    material error of law. I dismiss the Secretary of  State's  appeal  and
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
