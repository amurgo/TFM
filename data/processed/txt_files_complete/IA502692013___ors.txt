                        (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                 Respondents


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Adewoye, Prime Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   I shall refer to the  respondents  as  the  appellants  are  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  I shall refer  to  Mrs  Taye  Abimbola
    Alabi as the appellant because she is the

     main appellant and her husband Mr Egbeyemi Alabi and their  son  Master
    Emmanuel Alabi are dependent on her application.  They are all citizens
    of Nigeria.  The appellant's date of birth  is  13  February  1979,  Mr
    Alabi's date of birth is 6 May 1975 and Master Alabi's date of birth is
    23 May 2010.  The appellant and her husband have a younger child, I  am
    not aware of his or her date of birth.

2.   The appellant was granted leave to enter the UK as  a  Tier  4  General
    Student on 12 March 2009 and her leave was extended as a Tier 4 Student
    until 29 August 2011.  She was  subsequently  granted  a  variation  of
    leave as a Tier 1 Post-Study Migrant until 27 September 2013.  She  was
    joined in the UK by her husband and child Emmanuel in 2010.  They  were
    granted leave to enter the UK as Tier 1 dependants until  27  September
    2013.

3.   The appellant made an application  to  vary  her  leave  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) on 27 September 2013.  The application  was  refused  by
    the Secretary of  State  in  a  decision  of  14  November  2013.   The
    appellant has to establish that she has access to  funds  of  not  less
    than �50,000.  The business set up by  the  appellant  is  Divine  Gift
    Ventures (DGV). Her application was based on third party  support  from
    Mrs Modupeola Oshinowo in the UK and Mr Beyioku in Nigeria.


4.   The application  was  refused  by  the  respondent  for  the  following
    reasons:-

    (1)  The evidence that the appellant produced from GT Bank  in  Nigeria
         does not establish that the funds  held  in  Mr  Beyioku's  account
         there are transferrable to the UK or that the funds  are  available
         to the appellant.


    (2)  The third party declaration submitted by  Mrs  Oshinowo  does  not
         confirm that the funds will remain available to the appellant until
         such times as it is transferred to her business.


    (3)   The  appellant  failed  to  provide  a  letter   from   a   legal
         representative confirming the details in the  declaration  made  by
         Mrs Oshinowo.


    (4)  There is no indication from the bank that the appellant can access
         the funds belonging to Mrs Oshinowo as and when required.


    (5)  The occupation in which the appellant  is  engaged  is  below  the
         required level (National Qualifications Framework level 4)  because
         a courier or delivery service is a lower skilled occupation.


    (6)    The appellant has failed to produce documents in accordance with
         paragraph 41 41-SD(e  )(iv)  of  the  rules  because  she  has  not
         provided a contract.

5.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and her appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McIntosh
    in a determination that was promulgated on 16  June  2014  following  a
    hearing on 30 May 2014.  The Judge noted at paragraph 11 that the  bank
    statement from GT Bank dated 24 October 2013 failed to  establish  that
    the sums of money were available to the appellant and acknowledged that
    the evidence from Nigeria  was  not  in  a  prescribed  form.  He  also
    recorded (at paragraph 7) that the appellants conceded  that  they  had
    failed to provide a letter from a legal practitioner in relation to Mrs
    Oshinowo's funds. The Judge went on  to  allow  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules having heard oral evidence from  the  appellant,  her
    husband  and  Mrs  Oshinowo  and  having  considered  further  evidence
    produced by the appellant.

6.   The Secretary of State was granted leave to appeal  in  a  decision  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Cheales in a decision of 15 July  2014.  Thus
    the matter came before me.  The UT issued  directions  that  should  it
    decide to set aside the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal,  any
    further evidence, including supplementary oral evidence, that the Upper
    Tribunal may need to consider if it decides to remake the decision, can
    be so considered at that hearing.

7.   There was  no  further  evidence  produced  by  either  party  and  the
    appellant did not submit a response pursuant to Rule  24  of  the  2008
    Procedure Rules.



The Grounds of Appeal and Oral Submissions

8.   The grounds of appeal assert that the Judge took into account  evidence
    that was  not  admissible  pursuant  to  Section  85A  of  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") and in any event,  the
    decision is contrary to the appellant's concession that she had  failed
    to provide a letter from a legal practitioner (see paragraph 7  of  the
    determination).

9.   I heard oral submissions from both parties.  Mr Melvin expanded on  the
    grounds of  appeal.  Mr  Adewoye  submitted  that  the  documents  were
    produced in the wrong format and pursuant to  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  the  Secretary  of  State  should  have  given  the
    appellant an opportunity to produce the documents in the correct format
    (he confirmed that the documents had still not  been  produced  in  the
    right format).  In addition he argued that GT Bank was not  willing  to
    produce a letter which complied with the Rules.  In his view the letter
    from Mrs Oshinowo at page 9 of the appellant's bundle is sufficient  to
    comply with the requirements of the Rules, but  Mr  Adewoye  questioned
    the purpose of the solicitor's letter.  In relation to the  appellant's
    application and the requirement for a contract Mr Adewoye  referred  me
    to the judgment in Shebl (entrepreneur: proof of contracts) [2014] UKUT
    216 (IAC) and he argued that  it is not  necessary  to  have  a  formal
    contract drawn up and submitted when there is  evidence  of  a  genuine
    business placed before the Secretary of State.  In addition Mr  Adewoye
    referred me to page 20-23 of the appellant's bundle which, in his view,
    is evidence that establishes that the appellant was not only a  courier
    but a procurement officer.

10.  Mr Melvin referred  me  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  decision  in  Durrani
    (entrepreneurs: bank letters; evidential flexibility)  (Rev  1)  [2014]
    UKUT 295 and Ahmed & Another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 365
    (IAC).



The Immigration Rules

11.  The relevant parts of paragraph 41-SD of the Immigration  Rules  relate
    to specified documents.  41-SD(d) requires an applicant who is applying
    using money from a third party as  the  appellant  is  to  provide  the
    following documents:

         "(d) (i) An original written declaration  from  every  third  party
                  that they have made the money available  to  invest  in  a
                  business in the United Kingdom, containing:


                  (1)  the names of the third party and the  applicant  (and
                      his team partner's name where relevant), or the  name

                  (4)  the amount of money available in pounds sterling,


                  (5)   the  relationship(s)  of  the  third  party  to  the

                  (7)  ...


                  (8)  ...


                  (9)  confirmation that the  money  will  remain  available
                      until  such  time  as  it  is  transferred   to   the

                      applicant's business.

             (ii) A letter  from  a  legal  representative  confirming  the
                  validity of signatures  on  each  third-party  declaration
                  provided, which confirms that the declaration(s) from  the
                  third party or parties  contains  the  signatures  of  the
                  people stated.  It can be a  single  letter  covering  all
                  third-party permissions, or several letters  from  several

                  and not a copy, and it must be from a legal representative
                  permitted to practise in the country where the third party

                  following:

                      details,

                      applies, that the applicant  is  a  director  of  the
                      business named in each third-party declaration,


                  (5)  the third party's name,


                  (6)  the declaration from the third party  is  signed  and
                      valid, and


                  (7)  if the third party is not a Venture Capitalist  Firm,

                      Companies House will not be awarded points."



Error of Law

12.  The Judge  materially  erred  in  law  because  he  took  into  account
    evidence that was inadmissible pursuant to Section 85A of the 2002  Act
    (post application evidence).  It is clear  that  the  appellant  cannot
    satisfy the Immigration Rules not least because she had not produced  a
    letter  from  a  legal  representative  relating  to   Mrs   Oshinowo's
    declaration.  I set aside the decision of the Judge to allow the appeal
    pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement
    Act 2007.  I informed the parties that it was my view that I  could  go
    on and remake  the  decision.   There  was  no  objection  from  either
    representative.  I gave both representatives the  opportunity  to  make
    further submissions. The appellant, her husband and Mrs  Oshinowo  gave
    oral evidence at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  and  there
    is no challenge to the evidence as recorded by the Judge.



The Evidence of the Appellant

13.  The appellant's evidence is contained in her witness  statement  of  14
    May 2014 in addition to the oral evidence as recorded by the Judge.  In
    her witness statement the appellant describes her business as follows:

         "4.  I presently run a business outfit in February  with  the  sole
             aim  of  providing  consumer  services  such  as  negotiating,
             sourcing, procuring goods,  purchasing  and  delivering  goods
             mainly to Africa.  The outfit is unique in the  sense  that  I
             looked at the difficulties people have in purchasing goods and
             services and then exporting the goods.  The intention  was  to
             get a total package for a client.  The business no doubt needs
             a procurement officer who will double as procuring  items  for
             the business needs and at the same time procuring for  clients
             and customers.  It was decided that I will double as both  the
             director and the procurement officer  for  the  business.   My
             husband assists me from time to time in the business  when  he
             gets a chance to do the same.  The name  of  the  business  is
             Divine Gift Ventures (DGV) Ltd.  The business has its presence
             on the internet and is advertised on Gumtree and Yell.  I will
             rely on evidence of same at the hearing of my appeal.


         5.   Since inception of  the  business,  I  have  had  clients  who
             require my services such  as  individuals  and  companies  who
             trust our services and instruct us to purchase goods for  them
             at  reasonable  prices  and  ship  the  goods  to  an   agreed
             destination upon payment of our fees.  Because of the delicate
             nature of the business, both parties involved usually  proceed
             upon having a clear understanding of the liabilities  of  both
             parties".

14.  The appellant works as a procurement officer and it is this  aspect  of
    the business that is relied upon and not the courier  delivery  service
    as regards the application. Funds are to be provided  by  Mrs  Oshinowo
    and Mr Beyioku. GT Bank in Nigeria would not issue any other letter and
    it is obvious that funds can be transferred to the UK. In  relation  to
    the invoice produced in support of the application, there was  an  oral
    contract between the parties.

15.  The appellant understood that there was no need for  a  letter  from  a
    legal practitioner in relation to the UK-based sponsor.   Although  the
    letter from Mrs Oshinowo which was submitted with the application  does
    not state that the money will be available until  it  is  transferrable
    for use in the appellant's business, it does state that the money  will
    be available until it is required by the Home Office.

16.  The appellant has a private life in the UK.  She is  currently  a  sole
    director of her company and she pays taxes.  Her eldest son is 4 and he
    is settled well in his school.  The family have no home to go  back  to
    in Nigeria.  They married in the UK.


The Evidence of Mr Alabi

17.  Mr Alabi's evidence is contained in his witness  statement  of  14  May
    2014 in addition to the oral evidence as recorded by the Judge.  In his
    witness statement he agrees with his wife's evidence and  asserts  that
    they have developed a private and family life here in the UK.

Evidence of Mrs Oshinowo

18.  Mrs Oshinowo's evidence is contained in a witness statement of  25  May
    2014 in addition to the  oral  evidence  recorded  by  the  Judge.  Her
    evidence can be summarised.  She is providing �20,000 to  the  company.
    She believes the company will grow  and  it  will  become  one  of  the
    leading companies of its kind.



The Documentary Evidence

19.  The appellant submitted  various  documents  with  her  application  as
    follows:


        (1)   A letter from Mrs Oshinowo of 27 September 2013  which  is  a
         declaration confirming that she has �20,000 in  her  account  which
         can be used for the purpose of the application. She attached a bank
         statement from NatWest Bank confirming that she has  the  necessary
         funds in her bank account.


    (2)  A letter from GT Bank in Nigeria  of  24  October  2013  which  is
         entitled  a  letter  of  reference  relating  to  Mr  Beyioku   and
         confirming that he has three accounts as at the close  of  business
         on 23 October 2013.


    (3)  A declaration from Mr Beyioku of 21 October 2013  confirming  that
         he has �30,000 which is made available to the appellant.


    (4)  A letter from legal practitioners in Nigeria of  21  October  2013
         referring to Mr Beyioku's declaration.


    (5)  An invoice for �4,047.from Divine Gift Ventures (DGV) Ltd dated 26
         September 2013 to an individual in Basingstoke  for  "purchase  and
         courier  service."  The  invoice  states;  "service  for   Phedumez
         Consulting" and "courier service: goods sent via JMK Logistics  and
         Divine Cargo".


    (6)  A printout from  Gumtree  relating  to  procurement  services  and
         logistics services (courier and cargo  services)  and  Divine  Gift
         Ventures indicating that  it  is  one  of  the  growing  businesses
         recently set up with the objective of  providing  quality  business
         help, to source and negotiate for goods and services.


    (7)  A letter from HM Revenue & Customs of 20 May 2013 to  Divine  Gift
         Ventures  Ltd  indicating  that  the  company  needs  to  pay   its
         corporation tax by 1 December 2014  and  deliver  its  company  tax
         return by 28 February 2015.


    (8)  Documents relating to the registering of the company at  Companies
         House and confirming that both the appellant and  her  husband  are
         directors of the company.


    (9)  A letter from HM Revenue & Customs of 2 September 2013  to  Divine
         Gift Ventures which is a VAT online enrolment acknowledgement.


    (10) A letter from HM Revenue & Customs of 27  August  2013  confirming
         that the company needs to pay its corporation tax on 6 January 2015
         and deliver its company tax return on 5 April 2015.


    (11) There is an incomplete tax return and a  notice  to  make  a  CT61
         return.

20.  At the hearing before Judge McIntosh the appellant  produced  a  bundle
    and in the bundle there was  further  evidence  relied  upon  namely  a
    further declaration by Mrs Oshinowo of 27 May 2014, a letter  from  Mrs
    Oshinowo of 25 May 2014, a letter from Mayfair Solicitors  relating  to
    Mrs Oshinowo's declaration.

Conclusions

21.   I am not able to take the  post-date  evidence  (paragraph  20  above)
    into account in relation to the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    pursuant to Section  85A  of  the  2002  Act.  As  already  stated  the
    appellant cannot satisfy the rules,  not  least  because  she  has  not
    produced a letter from a legal representative  (with  her  application)
    relating to Mrs Oshinowo's declaration.   There are further reasons for
    the lack of compliance. In my view the evidence does not establish that
    the funds from Mr Beyioku would be available to the  appellant  or  her
    business.  I reject  Mr  Adewoye's  submissions  on  the  point  having
    considered the Upper Tribunal judgment in Durrani. I am  not  satisfied
    that there is confirmation that the  money  in  either  Mrs  Oshinowo's
    account (or Mr Beyioku's) will remain available until such a time as it
    is transferred to the applicant. Third party declarations  must  comply
    with a number of requirements and neither declaration confirms that the
    money will remain available until such time as it is transferred to the
    applicant.

22.   The  appellant's  case  is  that  she  is  a  procurement  officer  in
    accordance with the occupation listed at Appendix J SOC code 3541.  The
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal failed to make a finding  in  relation
    to this issue. The evidence  in  relation  to  this  is  lacking.   The
    appellant submitted  with  her  application  one  invoice  and  details
    relating to a website.  Whilst I appreciate that the respondent appears
    to accept that Divine Gift Ventures is a genuine company, the  evidence
    in my view does not establish  that  the  appellant's  job  is  as  she
    describes in her statement of evidence and one that could be  described
    as a procurement officer.

23.  There was one further issue taken by  the  Secretary  of  State  namely
    that the appellant had failed to produce documents in  accordance  with
    paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv) because she has not provided  a  contract.   The
    decision letter inadequately explains this point and I have  considered
    this in the context of the Upper Tribunal decision of Shebl.  This case
    is different to the case of Shebl because the  appellant  has  produced
    one invoice only in contrast to the substantial evidence  submitted  by
    the appellant in Shebl.  In my view the  appellant  has  not  submitted
    documents which  would  enable  her  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    paragraph  41-SD(e)(iv)(1).  However  the  refusal  letter   does   not
    adequately deal with the other requirements  of  the  Rules  which  are
    alternatives to the requirement for a contract.  In any event  this  is
    not material to the decision because  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules in any event.

24.  Mr Adewoye argued that  the  appellant  failed  to  consider  paragraph
    245AA of the Immigration Rules.  In fact this is not  accurate  because
    paragraph 245AA was considered by the Secretary of State who stated  as
    follows:

         "The decision has been made not to request additional documentation
         or exceptionally consider the application under the  provisions  of
         paragraph 245AA as the missing contracts are a  specified  document
         which should  have  been  provided,  it  is  not  anticipated  that
         addressing this omission would lead to the grant of leave".

25.  Paragraph 245AA does not benefit the appellant and the decision  is  in
    accordance with the law. In addition this was not an argument that  was
    advanced before the First-tier Tribunal.

Article 8

26.  The appellant relies on Article 8  of  the  1950  Convention  on  Human
    Rights.  The appellant and her  husband  and  their  two  children  are
    citizens of Nigeria.  They have a private life here but they  would  be
    returning together to Nigeria.  In relation to their private life Judge
    McIntosh seemed to accept that there was a genuine business.   However,
    the evidence does not establish that the trading  of  the  business  is
    significant or that it is making  such  a  profit  as  to  support  the
    appellant and her family.  There are two young  children  to  consider,
    the eldest of which is 4 years old.  However, he has not started  full-
    time compulsory education.  The children's best  interests  are  to  be
    with both their parents and return with them to Nigeria.   In  relation
    to Article 8 I am not satisfied that the appellants have a  significant
    private life that is material to their application however should I  be
    wrong about that I am satisfied that the decision is  proportionate  to
    the legitimate aim which is  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the  country
    through the maintenance  of  immigration  control.   I  note  that  the
    original grounds of appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal  argue  that
    the appellant has been paying tax, but the evidence produced  does  not
    establish a tax liability or payment made by the appellant.

27.  I remake the decision pursuant to Section 12(2)(b)(ii) and dismiss  the
    appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   In  addition  the  appeal  is
    dismissed under Article 8.  No anonymity direction made.
