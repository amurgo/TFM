                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Prior promulgated on 14 October 2014 dismissing the appeal of  Ms  Ekem
    against a decision of the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    dated 28 February 2014 to remove her from the United Kingdom  following
    rejection of her asylum claim.





Background

2.   The Appellant is a national of Ghana, born on 14 September  1988.   Her
    immigration history may be found in the cover sheet to the Respondent's
    bundle before the First-tier Tribunal.  She was issued a visit visa  to
    the United Kingdom on 15 August 2012 valid for six  months.   She  left
    Ghana on 15 September 2012 flying first to Portugal, where she  changed
    flights, and arriving in Heathrow on 16 September  2012.   It  is  said
    that she flew to the United Kingdom on her own but had been  given  the
    name of a man who would meet her at Heathrow.  She  next  came  to  the
    attention of the  authorities  in  the  United  Kingdom  when  she  was
    arrested on 9 July 2013 at the house of a person - who was said  to  be
    her boyfriend  -  called  Ben.   She  was  informed  that  she  was  an
    overstayer and that her boyfriend was married to an Italian woman.  She
    was detained on 15 July 2013 and submitted an Article 8 application for
    leave to remain which was refused on 7 August 2013.  She  was  released
    from detention on 30 August 2013 to live with a maternal relative at an
    address in Peckham, but was detained again  on  30  September  2013  as
    removal directions had been confirmed for 9 October 2013.  She asserted
    that she had made a claim for asylum on 16  August  2013,  and  removal
    directions were cancelled.  She was released from detention and in  due
    course an asylum interview was conducted on 31 October 2013.

3.   The Appellant's application for asylum was refused for reasons set  out
    in a 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') of 28 February 2014, and the
    removal decision that is  the  subject  of  this  appeal  was  made  in
    consequence.

4.   It is appropriate to note at this stage that the RFRL is a lengthy  and
    detailed document that attempts to address with manifest  care  various
    aspects of the Appellant's circumstances and claim  for  protection  in
    the United Kingdom.  It should also be noted that there was  a  further
    letter prepared by the Respondent dated 27  February  2014  determining
    that the Appellant was not a person who was the victim of  trafficking;
    appended to that letter is a minute or a note of consideration  setting
    out the reasons for reaching the conclusion in respect of  trafficking.
    Ms Chandran confirmed that the Appellant  had  not  made  any  separate
    challenge to the 'trafficking decision'.

5.   The Appellant appealed against the  removal  decision  of  28  February
    2014 to the IAC.

6.   The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  for  reasons
    set out in the determination of Judge Prior.

7.   The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  which
    was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers on 7  November  2014.
    In granting permission to appeal Judge Chambers said this:

          "A fair reading of the determination shows that the  judge  failed
         to  give  adequate  reasons  for  the  conclusions.   That  failure
         amounted to an error of law."

    I pause to note that in phrasing the grant of permission  in  that  way
    Judge Chambers would appear to pre-empt the consideration by the  Upper
    Tribunal; his observations should have been limited to whether  or  not
    any of the grounds were arguable.  For my own part I  do  not  consider
    myself in any way bound by  his  apparent  conclusion  that  there  had
    indeed been an error of law, and I disregard it.

Consideration

8.    In  addition  to  the  application  for  entry  clearance  which   was
    successful, the Appellant had made a  previous  application  for  entry
    clearance, the details of which are set out at  pages  B19-B37  of  the
    Respondent's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal.  The Appellant  had
    applied for entry  clearance  in  the  capacity  of  a  physiotherapist
    attached to an amputee football team  that  was  proposing  a  training
    course  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  September  2011.   This   earlier
    application for entry clearance was refused for reasons set  out  in  a
    Notice of Immigration Decision dated 30 September 2011  with  reference
    to paragraphs 41(i) and (ii) of the Immigration Rules because the entry
    clearance officer had not been satisfied  that  adequate  evidence  had
    been provided in respect of employment and income.

9.   The Appellant's successful application for entry clearance was made  in
    a  similar  capacity  as  a  physiotherapist  accompanying  an  amputee
    football team.  The details of this latter application are set  out  at
    pages B1-B18 of the Respondent's bundle.  The purpose of that visit was
    to accompany a team that was visiting the United Kingdom in  connection
    with the Paralympics that were taking place in London  that  year.   On
    this occasion, as has been indicated, the Appellant was successful:  at
    B3 it is noted  that  there  were  supporting  documents  submitted  in
    support of her application confirming her  role  as  a  physiotherapist
    with the amputee football team.

10.  The Appellant's apparent involvement  as  a  physiotherapist  with  the
    football team was  also  a  feature  of  the  RFRL.   As  part  of  the
    Appellant's account she claims that she was taken to Liberia  in  order
    to have sex with people unknown to her as part of her  exploitation  by
    Samuel, the person who had undertaken the paternal role in the  absence
    of her own  parents.   The  Respondent  rejected  this  aspect  of  the
    Appellant's case - indeed rejected the credibility of the Appellant  in
    almost all material respects - but in this  regard,  primarily  because
    the Respondent had identified a news item that appeared on 'Ghana  Web'
    in relation to "'The Feminine Side Of Amputee  Football'"  which  named
    Alvina Ekem as being currently the physiotherapist of the Ghana team in
    the context of a visit to Liberia to participate in a tournament. (RFRL
    paragraphs 25 and 27).

11.  The Respondent also relied upon the Appellant's apparent employment  as
    a physiotherapist as undermining her claim to  have  been  studying  at
    university: RFRL paragraph 28.

12.  The first entry clearance  application  is  also  significant  for  the
    following reasons.  It is the Appellant's account that this application
    was also made by David, who  assisted  her  in  the  second  successful
    application, and in respect of whom it is now said she  may  have  been
    trafficked to the UK.  However as identified  in  the  summary  of  the
    Appellant's narrative account at paragraph 7 of the RFRL, in particular
    at paragraph 7(h), it was not  until  July  2012,  on  the  Appellant's
    account, that she met David for the first time.  This  therefore  gives
    rise to a significant discrepancy at the core of her narrative.

13.  In her witness statement before the First-tier Tribunal  the  Appellant
    made a flat denial that she was ever involved with  the  Ghana  amputee
    team or is a physiotherapist. She does not, however, otherwise  address
    the evidence obtained by the Respondent that suggests otherwise,

14.  Be that as it may, the First-tier Tribunal Judge  addressed  issues  of
    credibility at paragraphs 27-29 of his decision.  Those paragraphs  are
    in the following terms:

         "27. Although the  Appellant,  in  testimony,  denied  signing  the
             application forms for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom,
             in her name, of 2011  and  2012  the  fact  remains  that  she
             sought, and in  2012  secured  entry  clearance  by  means  of
             deception.  The notice of refusal of 30 September 2011  refers
             to  the  statement  that  the  Appellant  was   'employed   as
             supporting  staff  with  Ghana  Amputee  Football   Federation
             earning... the equivalent of ï¿½156 per month'.  The application
             was refused by reason of the  lack  of  adequate  evidence  to
             substantiate that claim.  It must be assumed that, ostensibly,
             adequate evidence was obtained  to  substantiate  the  similar
             claim of employment to secure the entry clearance  granted  to
             the Appellant on 15 August 2012.

         28.  On the Appellant's own case she had ceased to live in  Odorkor
             at Samuel and Sheila's home in 2010 (according to the  adopted
             statement  or  2012  according  to   the   asylum   interview)
             commencing a university education at Winneba which was 2 or  3
             hours away from Official Town Odorkor.  Although  it  was  the
             Appellant's evidence in  her  statement  that  David  was,  in
             effect, sent by Samuel in order to have sexual relations  with
             the  Appellant  nonetheless  it  was  her  evidence  that   he
             "...became very kind to me".  I was not satisfied, even  if  I
             accepted the Appellant's evidence as reliable -  which  I  did
             not - that David constituted a  threat  to  the  Appellant  in
             Ghana since there was no  evidence  that  clearly  established
             that David had made threats against, and was a threat to,  the
             Appellant by reason of any failure on her part to make payment
             to him for arranging and paying for the Appellant to  come  to
             the United Kingdom.  The Appellant  claims  that  Charles  and
             David were working together and intended to  use  her  in  the
             United Kingdom however there is no clear or plausible evidence
             to that effect.

         29.  The reliance of the Appellant on admittedly flawed documentary
             evidence and the Appellant's inexplicable delay in  making  an
             asylum claim further, and heavily, detract from  the  reliance
             that can be placed upon her evidence.  I found her evidence to
             be wholly unreliable."

15.  The Judge then goes on to consider aspects of the  case  which  do  not
    directly relate to his credibility assessment.

16.  Necessarily, at paragraph 27, the Judge is reaching a  conclusion  that
    the Appellant employed deception by posing as a member of  the  support
    staff of the Ghana Amputee Football Federation in  circumstances  where
    she  claimed  on  appeal  that  she  was  no  such  person.   This   is
    inconsistent with  the  Respondent's  own  position  as  identified  at
    paragraph 27 of  the  RFRL.  It  is  not  clear  on  the  face  of  the
    determination why the Judge has rejected the evidence produced  by  the
    Respondent  to  the  effect   that   the   Appellant   was   indeed   a
    physiotherapist attached to the Ghana Amputee Football Federation.

17.  In  any  event,  the  next  reference  to  credibility  is  the  almost
    parenthetic reference at paragraph 28: "If I accepted  the  Appellant's
    evidence as reliable - which I did not - ...".  This reference  appears
    without any engagement with the Appellant's narrative as to any of  the
    events that took place in Ghana, or more particularly the circumstances
    upon which she asserts that she would be at risk  if  she  were  to  be
    returned at the present time.

18.  Whilst I accept that the reasoning at paragraph 29 is  more  cogent  in
    that it identifies matters that are relevant to credibility, even  here
    the treatment is  surprisingly  brief  given  the  complexity  of  this
    particular case, a complexity underscored by the detail with which  the
    Respondent approached the issue in the RFRL.  In the circumstances I am
    not satisfied that the references at paragraph 29 are sufficient, as it
    were, to save the decision from the lack of clarity  at  paragraphs  27
    and 28.

19.  In my judgment the reasons set out by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    are not adequate and neither party to  the  proceedings  can  be  clear
    exactly upon what basis the Judge has reached his decision.

20.  In such circumstances I  find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge is flawed for material error of  law  and  must  be  set
    aside.

21.  Realistically, as acknowledged by both representatives,  this  decision
    needs to be re-made before the First-tier  Tribunal  in  front  of  any
    judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Prior  with  all  issues  at
    large.  Necessarily the Appellant will need to address  the  particular
    discrepancies that I have identified at paragraphs  8-12  above,  along
    with the other issues and discrepancies clearly and cogently identified
    in the RFRL.

Notice of Decision

22.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved a  material  error  of
    law and is set aside.

23.  The decision in the appeal is  to  be  re-made  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in front of any judge other  than  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Prior.

24.  The anonymity order previously made is continued.

    given at the hearing on 25 February 2015.
