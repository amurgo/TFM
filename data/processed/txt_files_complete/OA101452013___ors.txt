                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by an Entry Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  against  a
        determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Caskie promulgated on 27
        February 2014 in which he allowed the appeals of  the  three  above
        named Respondents.


     2. Anonymity was granted because the Respondents  are  young  children
        who at the date of decision, 22nd April 2013, were aged eight, six,
        and three. The sponsor is their father.


     3. The chronology indicates  that  the  sponsor  came  to  the  United
        Kingdom in 1999 as a student. His leave  was  extended  as  a  work
        permit  holder  after  which  in  September  2013  he  was  granted
        Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). He, like the  Respondents,  is  a
        national of Zimbabwe.


     4. The sponsor told the Judge that they had  "tried  to  sort  it  out
        before they left the UK for the purposes of our holiday to Zimbabwe
        as the children had no status". Attempts made to secure status were
        not successful yet the family still chose to travel to Zimbabwe for
        the purposes of a holiday during the Easter period.


     5. Applications were made by the Respondents for leave  to  enter  the
        United Kingdom with their parents, indicating a wish to travel back
        to the United Kingdom on 13th April 2013. The  applications  appear
        to be in identical form, as the Respondents are siblings, and  were
        refused for the same reason by  the  ECO;  namely  that  they  were
        seeking to join their father, that the Rules require them  to  show
        funds of �600 have been held for each of the three  applicants  for
        three  months  prior  to  the  application,  meaning  there  was  a
        requirement to demonstrate �1800 being held for  three  months.  No
        evidence of any funds held by the Respondent's parents was provided
        and that as their  father's  certificate  of  sponsorship  did  not
        include certification of maintenance it was necessary that he would
        have to show evidence of the required funds for the application  of
        three months in his own bank account.  As this did not  happen  the
        ECO was not able to accept such sponsorship in order to certify the
        maintenance requirement as a result of which he was  not  satisfied
        that the required funds  were  available.   The  applications  were
        refused under paragraph 399H (g) of the Immigration Rules.


     6. The Respondents' appealed.  The Judge notes that the children  were
        born in the United Kingdom and this was the first  family  trip  to
        Zimbabwe that had taken place during the Easter  holiday  with  the
        intention that the children would return at the end of the holiday.
        The Judge  records  that  family  savings  had  been  exhausted  in
        preparation for the family trip  and  that  the  children  attended
        primary school in Stockton on Tees  which  they  had  missed  as  a
        result of the refusal of their applications [5].


     7. The Judge also expresses surprise that the ECO failed  to  consider
        whether it was appropriate to grant leave in  terms  of  Article  8
        ECHR and specifically accepts that the  children  cannot  meet  the
        Immigration Rules or Appendix FM Rules but than makes  a  statement
        that, in his opinion,  he  is  in  no  doubt  whatsoever  that  the
        children are entitled succeed in a claim on Article 8 grounds [7].


     8. The Judge finds the children have a family and private life in  the
        United Kingdom that the decision interferes  with.  The  issue  was
        that of proportionality.  The  Judge  disposes  of  this  important
        element of the appeal in the following way:


     9.   That then simply leaves the question of  proportionality.   During
   by             time as an Immigration Judge I have not  seen  a  case  in
   which the            decision  of  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  or  the
   Secretary of State is            more disproportionate than the  decision
   in the present case. These            young children have  lived  in  the
   United Kingdom for the whole of           their lives. Their  father  has
   now been granted indefinite leave to          remain. The  children  were
   born in the United Kingdom. The children           are entitled  to  each
   register as British citizens in terms of Section 1  (3)                of
   the British Nationality  Act  1981  and  have  been  entitled  to  do  so
   from September 2013. That of course is not a matter that  I  am  entitled
     to take account of but I am entitled to take account  of  is  the  fact
   that           in April 2013 (when the decision in the present  case  was
   taken) the              parents of these  children  had  resided  in  the
   United Kingdom for as            long as they had, their father  had  all
   but completed the  necessary            qualifying  period  in  order  to
   obtain indefinite leave to remain and              the children  although
   not yet entitled to register as British citizens            would be very
   likely  indeed  to  be   entitled   to   so   register   within   a   few
   months of the decision being taken .


     10.  At the date of decision the children  were  citizens  of  Zimbabwe
           however,  it  will  be   entirely   unrealistic   in   a   proper
   proportionality               assessments  to  ignore  completely   their
   potential  entitlement  in  early             course  to  obtain  British
   citizenship. However, even if that were  not             the  case  I  am
   entirely   satisfied   that   the   decision   in   the   present    case
   would be a  disproportionate  interference  in  the  family  and  private
   lives of these children. Without hesitation these appeals are allowed.


     9. The ECO sought permission to appeal on the grounds that  the  Judge
        failed  to  provide  adequate  reasons  for  why  the  Respondents'
        circumstances are either compelling or exceptional by reference  to
        the structure in which Article 8 applications need to  be  assessed
        in cases where an individual is unable to satisfy the  requirements
        of the relevant immigration rule. Permission  was  granted  on  the
        basis it was arguable the Judge had not made adequate  findings  in
        respect of exceptionality.



Error of law


    10. The Judge acknowledged in his determination, at paragraph  7,  that
        "the children of course  do  not  meet  the  Immigration  Rules  or
        Appendix FM rules for admission to the United Kingdom in  terms  of
        Article 8 ECHR but I am in no doubt whatsoever  that  the  children
        are entitled to succeed in a claim on Article 8  grounds".  Such  a
        finding, on the face of it, appears to be contradictory  indicating
        that the children fail in terms of Article  8  but  thereafter  are
        entitled to succeed under this head.


    11. It is also of concern that the Judge spent some time  referring  to
        the fact the children  may  be  entitled  to  register  as  British
        citizens at some point in the future  when  such  observations  are
        purely speculative, especially  if  there  are  insufficient  funds
        available to this family unit. As an entry clearance decision it is
        also necessary to consider any Article 8 aspects  at  the  date  of
        decision.  To put weight upon a potential entitlement  does  appear
        to be somewhat irrational when considering the  proportionality  of
        the decision.


    12. The Judge is also  criticised  for  a  structural  failing  in  his
        approach to the Article 8 assessment which is an argument that  has
        merit.  The appeal should have been considered in  accordance  with
        the approach set out by the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria)  [2013]
        EWCA Civ 1192, the High Court in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)  and
        by the Upper Tribunal in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640, as  confirmed  by
        Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014]  UKUT  00085  (IAC).   These
        judgments have made it clear that the question  of  proportionality
        must be looked at in the context of the Immigration Rules  with  no
        need to go on to a specific assessment under Article  8  if  it  is
        clear from the facts that there are  no  particular  compelling  or
        exceptional circumstances requiring that course to be  taken.  Such
        an approach was confirmed in broadly  similar  terms  by  Court  of
        Appeal in MM & Ors [2014] EWCA Civ 985 @ para 134 and is consistent
        with the approach of the House of Lords, particularly in cases such
        as Huang [2007] UKHL 11 and Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.


    13. Not only was this exercise not undertaken it is not clear from  the
        determination whether the  Judge  found  that  unjustifiably  harsh
        consequences arose from the decision and, if so, what they are.  It
        is accepted that the impact of the decision is  that  the  children
        remained in Zimbabwe with other family members whilst their  mother
        and father returned to the United Kingdom, but the impact  of  that
        upon the children should have been adequately analysed to ascertain
        whether there was a need to  undertake  a  freestanding  Article  8
        assessment.


    14. If it was found necessary on the facts to undertake the  Article  8
        assessment outside the Rule the Judge was required  to  follow  the
        guidance provided in the case of  Razgar.   This  appears  to  have
        done,  in  part,  as  he  concludes  that  the  issue  was  one  of
        proportionality. The  Judge's  findings  regarding  proportionality
        seem to focus upon the potential loss of benefit  to  the  children
        being able to apply under the British Nationality Act 1981 but this
        is speculative, as there is no  basis  for  claiming  a  legitimate
        expectation to be granted such status, and  is  not  something  the
        Judge should have considered as he records  in  the  determination.
        The  determination  fails  completely  to  engage  with  the  ECO's
        arguments regarding  why  the  decision  was  proportionate  or  to
        identify any other factors that support a sustainable finding  that
        the decision is not proportionate,  such  as  the  actual  physical
        and/or emotional impact upon the children.


    15.  I  find  that  the  ECO  has  established  legal  error   in   the
        determination.  The question is whether that error is material.


    16. The Upper Tribunal is grateful to  the  sponsor  who  attended  and
        again confirmed the family history as set out in the determination;
        including the fact that when he and his wife applied for  ILR  they
        deliberately did not name the children on the application form,  in
        2011, which is a partial  explanation  for  why  the  children  are
        currently without status or permission to enter or  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom with their parents.  The family decided  to  have  a
        holiday and so  the  sponsor,  his  wife  and  the  three  children
        travelled to Zimbabwe. Attempts to regularise the children's status
        prior to departure failed and so the mother and father  were  aware
        of the need to make a formal application for the  children  to  re-
        enter.  It was stated today  that  the  requirements  for  such  an
        application were checked before the family left for their holiday.


    17. It appears to be part of the case that as  a  result  of  enquiries
        being made late in the day there was insufficient time to sort  the
        children's status out before they went on holiday.  It may also  be
        that as a result of going on holiday and  the  costs  of  the  same
        there were insufficient funds to meet the maintenance requirements.
        Whatever maybe the chronology of events, it is clear that when  the
        children were taken out of the United Kingdom  it  was  known  that
        they had no lawful status permitting them to return unless that was
        granted  to  them  as  a  result  of  a  proper   entry   clearance
        application.


    18. The visit was  to  the  children's  maternal  aunt  and  family  in
        Zimbabwe.  When  their  application  was  rejected  the  children's
        mother and father  returned  to  the  United  Kingdom  leaving  the
        children with relatives in Zimbabwe. The Tribunal has been  advised
        that the children's mother has since returned to Zimbabwe where she
        is with the children, ensuring their physical and  emotional  needs
        are met.


    19. The chronology shows this is a situation created by the  children's
        parents as a result of their failure to regularise  the  children's
        status, failure to ensure that adequate  funds  were  available  to
        meet the requirements of the Rules, and taking the children out  of
        the United Kingdom without any guarantee or legitimate  expectation
        that they will be entitled to re-enter.


    20. It is accepted that the requirements of the Rules cannot be met and
        so the only avenue  at  this  stage  is  either  to  make  a  fresh
        application, as it is stated that funds are now available, or under
        Article 8 ECHR.  It has been made clear in a number of  authorities
        and decisions of the Senior Courts that Article 8 is not a  'golden
        ticket' which allows judges to depart from the requirements of  the
        Rules and nor does it allow individuals to choose where  they  wish
        to live.  All members of this family are Zimbabwean  nationals  and
        although the family wish to live in the United Kingdom it  has  not
        been shown that they cannot live  together  as  a  family  unit  in
        Zimbabwe. In relation to any ongoing effects; the children are  now
        in school in Zimbabwe, there is regular contact with  their  father
        in the United Kingdom, and although the children wish to return  to
        their old schools, friends, and for  family  life  to  continue  as
        before, the impact appears to be the effects of having to  readjust
        rather than unjustifiably harsh consequences, even  when  the  best
        interests of the children, as summarised in Zoumbas v  SSHD  [2013]
        UKSC 74, are considered.


    21. The maintenance requirements are an important aspect of  the  Rules
        and are lawful as recently confirmed by the Court of Appeal in  MM.
        It is now said that  a  fresh  application  can  be  made,  as  the
        required funds exists, and therefore any period  of  separation  or
        continuing separation is only likely to be for the period  of  time
        it takes for such an application to be made and processed.


    22. I find the Judge materially erred in failing to adopt  the  correct
        structural approach for the Article 8 assessment and in failing  to
        make adequate findings in accordance with the law. I find that  the
        consequences  for  the  children  have  not  been   shown   to   be
        unjustifiably harsh such as to warrant Article 8  being  considered
        outside the Rules although, in  the  alternative,  if  it  was  the
        decision will be found to be proportionate based upon the facts  of
        this case and the opportunity to make a further  application  which
        according to the sponsor  is  likely  to  succeed,  indicating  any
        separation is not likely to be  permanent  or  over  a  substantial
        period of time. In any event, in relation to a freestanding Article
        8 assessment, the fact family life can continue in Zimbabwe is also
        a relevant factor.


Decision

    23. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    24. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  I
        continue that order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).


   Fee Award.


   Note: this is not part of the determination.
   I make no fee award as the appeal has been dismissed.
