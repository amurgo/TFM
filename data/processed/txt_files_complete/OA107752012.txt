                                                                  Respondent
Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr A Rahman, Legal Representative, Jalalabad Law
Assocs.
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 13th October  1990.
      She appeals with permission to the Upper Tribunal. She appealed to the
      First-tier Tribunal against the decision of  the  respondent  refusing
      her application for settlement in the UK as the wife of Mr Hossein,  a
      British citizen, whom she married in Bangladesh in April 2011.


   2. The appellant was required to meet the  Income  Support  threshold  in
      order to satisfy the relevant  requirement,  as  it  then  was,  under
      paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules.


   3. The Judge accepted that the sponsor has been employed by Mr Alam as at
      the date of decision. However, he did not accept that  there  was  any
      reliable or credible evidence that the sponsor's earnings  were  �1025
      per month as at  the  date  of  decision.  The  Judge  calculated  his
      earnings at Rice and Spice  to  be  �8523  over  13  months  from  1st
      November 2011. That resulted in an income of �673 a month, or  �153  a
      week. His rent was �297 a month or �68.53 a week. He also had  council
      tax to pay.


   4. The Income Support  threshold  for  a  couple  was  �115.45  in  2012.
      Accordingly the sponsor fell below that level and was not able to show
      that he could maintain the appellant without recourse to public funds.
      The appeal was accordingly dismissed under the Immigration Rules.


   5. On 12th November 2013, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ford  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. It was  arguable
      that as at the date  of  decision,  the  sponsor's  earnings  were  as
      claimed. In addition it was also arguable that the evidence of savings
      making up any perceived shortfall should have been considered.


   6. At the hearing on  16th  December  2013,  Mr  Bramble  at  the  outset
      conceded that the Judge had made a material error on a point  of  law,
      and further conceded that the appellant had in fact demonstrated  that
      the maintenance requirement had been properly satisfied.


   7. The HMRC letter to the sponsor dated 14th  August  2013  set  out  his
      employment history for the tax year 2012-2013. For his employment  for
      the tax year ending 5th April 2013, he received �8,573 for the  period
      1st November 2011 until 30th November 2012. The 6th April 2012 was the
      start date.


   8. In the HMRC letter dated 31st August 2012 in respect of the  tax  year
      ending 5th April 2012, the start date in respect of employment with Mr
      Alam was 1st November 2011.  The letter confirmed the P60 end of  year
      certificate for the tax year to 5th April 2012. As noted,  the  HMRC's
      letter  dated  14th  August  2013  confirmed  the  P60  end  of   year
      certificate for the tax year to 5th April 2013.


   9. Mr Bramble accepted that there were no  discrepancies  or  conflicting
      evidence. The appellant's claimed earnings  for  the  relevant  period
      exceeded �1035 a month.


  10. In the light  of  the  independent  evidence  from  the  HMRC,  it  is
      contended that the Judge should have been satisfied that the threshold
      relating to maintenance had been met. As at the date of decision,  his
      net wage was �248.66 a week, when regard is had to the sponsor's  2013
      P60. His house rent is �68.76 a week. Accordingly, if that is deducted
      from his weekly net wage, he is left with �179.90. That satisfies  the
      threshold requirements as set  out  in  KA  and  Others  (Adequacy  of
      Maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065.


  11. In addition, it has also asserted that the Judge  failed  to  consider
      savings in the sponsor's account of almost �1,800 at the time  of  the
      decision.


  12. Mr Bramble informed the tribunal that he accepted the figures  as  set
      out at paragraph 5.2 of the appellant's skeleton argument  before  the
      Upper Tribunal.


     Assessment


  13. I have had regard to the concession made by Mr Bramble, which  I  find
      was properly made.


  14. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, including the  HMRC  letters
      and the P60s, I find that the appellant's net wage was  �248  a  week.
      There is no dispute as  to  his  house  rent  of  about  �69  a  week.
      Accordingly there is a  substantial  amount  left  in  excess  of  the
      relevant minimum Income Support threshold applicable required for  the
      appellant and his spouse.


     Decision


     The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
error on a point of     law.  I  set  aside  the  decision  and  re-make  it
allowing the  appellant's appeal.


        No anonymity direction made.
