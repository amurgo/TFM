Representation:
Appellant   Not present
Respondent  Mr Staunton (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are nationals  of  Poland.  On  December  5,  2014  they
    applied for documents certifying permanent residence as confirmation of
    their rights of permanent residence in the United Kingdom as dependants
    of an EEA national.   The  respondent  refused  their  applications  on
    January 10, 2015 (along with their father's application).

 2. The  appellants,  along  with  their  father,  appealed  against  those
    decisions under Regulation 26 of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area)  Regulations  2006  and  section  82(1)   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on January 26, 2015.

 3. The matter was dealt with on the papers  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Taylor on July 2, 2015 and in a decision promulgated  on  July
    23, 2015 the Tribunal allowed their appeals and that of their father.

 4. The respondent applied for permission to appeal on  July  31,  2015  in
    respect of these two appellants. No appeal was lodged in respect of the
    father's appeal that was dealt with at  the  same  time  and  has  case
    number IA/03853/2015. The respondent submitted the Tribunal  had  erred
    in respect of these two appellants because there was no  evidence  that
    the children  had  lived  here  for  five  years  as  required  by  the
    Regulations.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    White on October 28, 2015 and  the  matter  first  came  before  me  on
    January 18, 2016. On that occasion I found there had been an  error  in
    law because there had been no evidence before Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Taylor that the children had been  present  for  a  continuous
    period of five years as was required by the Regulations.

 6. The appellants' father produced  at  the  hearing  a  letter  from  his
    children's' doctor that provided some support for them being  here  for
    five years but the document was not conclusive.

 7. I adjourned the case for the father to produce evidence that showed the
    children had been here for five years continuously.

 8. The appellants' father sent letters to the  respondent  that  confirmed
    both children had attended firstly [ - ] Primary School and then [ -  ]
    Academy and had done so from September 6, 2006 to the present  day.  Mr
    Staunton agreed that this evidence satisfied him and he did not  oppose
    the granting to them of permanent residence.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal did not make made an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to make any order now.

    DECISION

10. There had been a material error.  I set aside the decision to allow the
    appeal under the Regulations.

11. I remade the decision and allowed both appeals for permanent  residence
    under the 2006 Regulations.

FEE AWARD

I make no fee award as the appeal was allowed only after  the  evidence  was
submitted
