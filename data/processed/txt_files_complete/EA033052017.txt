Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Claire, instructed by Legal Chambers Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J McGirr, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge R M Smith promulgated on 6  April  2018  dismissing
    his appeal against a decision made on 18 August 2016 to  refuse  him  a
    residence card as confirmation of his right of residence in the  United
    Kingdom  pursuant  to  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations").

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom in 2009 as a  student  and  in
    2010, whilst he had leave to remain, met a Spanish national  with  whom
    he lived and married on 5 August 2011.  On 22 September 2012 they had a
    child, who is a Spanish national, and subsequent to that, the appellant
    applied for a residency card granted with leave until 15 August 2017.

 3. The marriage unfortunately broke  down  on  13  October  2014  and  the
    appellant commenced divorce proceedings on 2 March 2015.   It  is  said
    that the appellant's now ex-wife was, at the point at which her divorce
    proceedings were commenced, exercising treaty rights though being self-
    employed, although it is now also said in submissions before  us  today
    that she had at some point been in receipt of job seeker's allowance.

 4. The judge directed himself that he should consider  the  position  with
    regard to the former wife as to whether she was exercising  her  treaty
    rights at the date of divorce.  The  judge  concluded  that  there  was
    insufficient evidence to show that she had in  fact  been  earning  the
    �3,000 declared in her tax return for the tax year 2015/2016, it  being
    noted that that was well below the tax threshold and was unsupported by
    any other documentation.  The judge also  concluded  that  he  was  not
    satisfied by the appellant's explanation as to why he could not produce
    any further evidence from his wife.

 5. On that basis, the appeal was dismissed, the judge concluding that  the
    appellant had not established that his wife was exercising  her  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom at the time their marriage was dissolved.

 6. Permission to appeal against that decision was sought on  a  number  of
    grounds, it being asserted in particular that the judge  had  erred  in
    his assessment of the evidence and that it had been difficult  for  the
    appellant to obtain any evidence at all; and, that he had taken  proper
    attempts to obtain the employment documents off the wife which had  not
    been provided. It was argued also  that  the  judge  had  not  properly
    considered the weight to be attached to the letter from  HM  Revenue  &
    Customs.

 7. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer on 25  September
    2018.  She concluded that it was arguable that the First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in law in requiring evidence to particularise the  claimed  self-
    assessment, given all the evidence available when viewed in the  round,
    also that it was difficult to identify the date, which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal considered appropriate, to address the issue  of  whether  the
    sponsor was exercising treaty rights.  It had now been  clarified  that
    the relevant date is the date of commencement of  divorce  proceedings.
    Permission was granted only on that ground.

 8. We heard submissions from Mr Claire who we accept is entitled to  amend
    his grounds to include the point raised by Judge Plimmer when  granting
    permission.  We accept in consequence and in light of Baigazieva [2018]
    EWCA Civ 1088, that the judge looked at the wrong date  when  assessing
    whether the appellant's wife was exercising Treaty Rights.  It  is  now
    settled law that he should have looked at the date on which proceedings
    commenced, 5 March 2015 and not the date of the decree absolute.

 9. We do not however consider, in light of the matters to  which  we  will
    now turn, that this was a material error.   It  was  incumbent  on  the
    appellant to show that his  now  ex-wife  had  been  exercising  treaty
    rights, either as a worker or as a self-employed person at the relevant
    date. It is not contended that she was self-sufficient or a student.

10. We were helpfully taken through the evidence by Mr  Claire  as  to  the
    wife's income which he accepts was modest.  The tax return for the year
    April 2014 to April 2015, which is the relevant  period  for  assessing
    whether or not the ex-wife  was  exercising  treaty  rights,  shows  an
    income of �868 which is said to be by way of a pension but we  are  now
    told that this was a payment of Job Seeker's Allowance. There is also a
    declaration of self-employment showing an income of �647.

11. We were also taken to some receipts from eBay, it being said  that  the
    former wife had been making selling jewellery on eBay,  but  there  are
    only two of these to which we were taken, one  showing  receipt  of  99
    pence, the other showing receipt of  US$2.99.   In  addition,  we  were
    taken to the assessment of tax credits for the tax year  2014  to  2015
    issued in July 2014.  That assessment proceeds on the  basis  that  the
    former wife was earning �1,560 per annum.

12. The difficulty that the appellant faces is not that he  could  not  get
    further information and documentation from his wife, but  that,  taking
    the case at its highest, the total amount of income  disclosed  by  the
    wife for the purposes of income tax is �647 by way of  turnover,  which
    is, in itself, unlikely to be the true earnings given that  there  must
    have been some expenses incurred in her making  jewellery,  buying  the
    raw materials before making it and thus, �647 is the high point of  any
    income.  This is said to arise over an entire year. We consider that on
    no view could such an income at this level, demonstrated we  accept  by
    evidence of a small number of small transactions on eBay,  be  anything
    other than marginal or ancillary and thus would not  be  sufficient  to
    show that the appellant's wife was self-employed.

13. We do not consider either that the sum of �868 by way of  Job  Seekers'
    Allowance, and this is not a matter properly  raised  in  the  grounds,
    could be seen as being evidence of exercising treaty rights. Further it
    is unclear to which period this  relates  and  whilst  receipt  of  job
    seeker's allowance  is  indicative  that  the  recipient  was  actively
    seeking work, there are a number  of  other  matters  that  would  have
    needed to have been considered which could not be  obtained  except  by
    evidence from the wife as to her intentions.

14. Further it does not appear to have been suggested at any point  to  the
    Secretary of State or, for that matter to the judge,  that  the  former
    wife was in receipt of Job Seekers' Allowance nor any indication as  to
    the period over which it was paid. Given the lack of evidence of  prior
    status as a worker, or as self-employed, and given the very  low  level
    of income generated, there is no proper basis on which it could be said
    that the former wife had retained any former status pursuant to  reg  6
    of the EEA Regulations as amended by the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) (Amendment) Regulations (SI 2018/801).

15. In the circumstances we consider that, even  taking  the  case  at  its
    highest, there is simply no basis on which  a  judge  could  rationally
    have concluded on the material provided that  the  appellant's  ex-wife
    had in fact been exercising treaty rights for the reasons given.   That
    is because there is simply nothing more that could have been  shown  or
    could have been provided even had there been material disclosed  by  HM
    Revenue & Customs.  It could not have shown any greater level of income
    than was already declared without it casting doubt on itself. The level
    of income is of such a nature and was generated in such a way as to  be
    manifestly marginal and ancillary.

16. For these reasons we find that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    did not involve the making of an error of law capable of affecting  the
    outcome and we dismiss the appeal accordingly.


SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS


 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error of law, and we uphold it.

 2. No anonymity direction is made.
