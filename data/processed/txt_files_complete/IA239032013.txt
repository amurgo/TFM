Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss S Khan, of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr D Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Albania born 14th November 1978. This  is
    his appeal, with permission against the  decision  of  the  FtT  (Judge
    Reed) promulgated on 8th November  2013,  by  which  it  dismissed  his
    appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal to  grant  him  an  EEA
    Residence Card as confirmation of  a permanent right  of  residence  in
    the UK as a family member of a qualified EEA national.



History

 2. The Appellant lived in Greece from 1996 to 2000, and there met Roidoula
    Fitanoglu, a Greek national. Miss Fitanoglu travelled to the UK in 1999
    and became a student. The Appellant  followed  her  here  in  2000  and
    claimed  asylum.  That  claim  was  refused.  The  Appellant  and  Miss
    Fitanoglu were married on 25th October 2004.

 3. On 4th November 2005,  Roidoula  Fitanoglu  was  granted  a  six  month
    Residence Permit and on  15th  May  2006  was  granted  a  Registration
    Certificate. In line with this the Appellant was  granted  a  Right  of
    Residence for six months and then for  five  years  (May  2006  to  May
    2011).

 4. In April 2011 the Appellant applied for a Residence Card as a permanent
    resident but this was refused.

 5.  On  29th  October  2012  he  applied  for  permanent  residence  under
    Regulation 10. His application was refused and his subsequent appeal to
    the FtT dismissed. It is this application which forms the basis of  the
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 6. Neither the Respondent nor the FtT were  satisfied  that  it  could  be
    shown that the Appellant's wife (and Sponsor)  was  economically  self-
    sufficient within the meaning of the EEA Regulations. In addition there
    was no  evidence  of  comprehensive  sickness  insurance  covering  the
    Appellant, in accordance with Regulation 4 of the EEA Regulations 2006.
    Further a question was raised on whether the Appellant and his wife are
    still in a subsisting relationship such as to engage  Article  8  ECHR.
    The FtT made a clear finding that the Appellant had not shown  that  he
    is still in a  subsisting  relationship  with  Roidoula  Fitanoglu  nor
    presented evidence to confirm that she is even in the UK at the present
    time.

 7. The  Appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  the  FtT  decision  and
    initially this was refused, but granted on a renewed application before
    the UT. In granting permission UTJ Macleman said;

         "In the First-tier  Tribunal,  Judge  Reed  dismissed  this  appeal
         against refusal of a  residence  card,  and  Judge  Murray  refused
         permission to appeal.

         On ground 1, the Appellant gave Judge Reed  no  useful  assistance,
         and AG seems to be an authority against the appellant on how  self-
         sufficiency may be shown, not in his favour. On ground  2,  neither
         the case cited nor the vague reference to a "letter by  Mr  Cox  to
         ILPA" do  much  to  advance  the  view  that  payment  of  national
         insurance contributions equates to comprehensive medical insurance.
         On Ground 3, a note by the AIRE Centre is  not  authority  for  the
         proposition that the requirement for health  insurance  is  met  by
         availability of the NHS, and the note says that  current  case  law
         tends against the appellant.

         The novel and radical propositions now made were not in the grounds
         of appeal to the FtT, and although raised at the hearing were  only
         weakly developed. While there is enough in the grounds to call  for
         further submissions, much more precision and clarity is required if
         they are to get anywhere."

 8. Thus the matter comes before me to determine whether  the  decision  of
    the FtT contains an error of law requiring  it  to  be  set  aside  and
    remade.



The Hearing

 9. Miss Khan on behalf of the Appellant referred to  the  grounds  seeking
    renewed permission.  In  those  grounds  reliance  was  placed  by  the
    Appellant on 3 matters:

      i) The Judge had erred in his assessment of self-sufficiency.

     ii) The Judge had erred in his consideration of the historic compulsory
         national insurance.

    iii) The Judge had erred in rejecting NHS cover as  sufficient  to  meet
         the requirement of comprehensive medical insurance.

10. So far as both points ii) and iii) are concerned,  Miss  Khan  sensibly
    accepted that she was in difficulty following the decision of the Court
    of Appeal in Ahmad v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 988.  In  the  lead  judgment
    Arden LJ states;

         "I would dismiss this appeal. If an EEA national enters the  United
         Kingdom and is not involved in an economically active activity, for
         example because she is a student, her residence  and  that  of  her
         family members will not be lawful unless she has CSIC while she  is
         a student in the five years following her arrival. Accordingly  her
         family members will not be able to qualify for permanent  residency
         in the UK.

         So Mrs Ahmed had to  have  CSIC  while  she  was  a  student.  This
         condition must be strictly complied with. The fact that  she  would
         be entitled to treatment under the NHS, and was thus at  all  times
         in substantially the same position as she would have been  had  she
         had CSIC, is nothing to the point. Her failure to take out CSIC put
         the host state at risk of having to pay for healthcare  at  a  time
         when the Ahmads had not  then  achieved  the  status  of  permanent
         resident and she was not economically active,

         In paragraph 7 of this judgment, I said that the ultimate issue  on
         this appeal was whether the conditions in Article 7(1)  are  to  be
         interpreted under EU law in a dynamic way, so that it is enough  if
         they are substantially or functionally fulfilled, or  whether  they
         are to be strictly interpreted on the basis that  the  right  to  a
         permanent residence card is a  privilege  which  is  not  conferred
         unless there is strict and literal compliance with the  conditions.
         It is clear from the cases discussed in this judgment,  culminating
         in the recent decision of the CJEU in Brey, that  they  are  to  be
         interpreted strictly subject to the general principles of  EU  law,
         such as proportionality."

11. Further so far as point ii) is concerned it is claimed the FtT made  an
    error  in  its  consideration  of  the  historic  compulsory   national
    insurance point. Miss Khan relied on a concession made in the  case  of
    Czop. The FtT in its decision fully dealt with this matter and came  to
    its conclusion at paragraph [32] where it says,

         "I have  considered  Miss.  Khan's  submissions  relying  upon  the
         written submissions from AIRE, and do not agree with them. Whilst a
         concession appears to have been made in the case of Czop, there  is
         nothing to indication that whoever made this  concession  gave  any
         real thought to insurance when making the concession. The directive
         makes make (sic) specific requirements that self-sufficient persons
         and students  must  show  that  they  have  comprehensive  sickness
         insurance cover in  the  host  member  state.  The  directive  says
         nothing about an individual being able to rely on  publicly  funded
         state  health  resources  to  satisfy  this  requirement,  and   my
         attention was not directed to any decided case where  a  court  has
         directly decided an issue under the directive on the  lines  argues
         by AIRE. On the other hand, numerous cases have  been  before  both
         the English courts and indeed the European Court of  Justice  where
         the need for Comprehensive sickness insurance (other than  publicly
         funded resources provided by the host state) has been affirmed."

12. As Mr Duffy submitted  the Czop case was a DWP case.  In  any  event  a
    concession  made  by  the  UK  government  in  one  set  of  litigation
    proceedings, whilst persuasive, is not binding,  whereas Ahmed is. That
    in my judgment is sufficient to dispose of grounds (ii) and (iii).

Ground (i)

13. Miss Khan in what was essentially  a  repetition  of  the  matters  put
    before the FtT submitted that Judge Reed erred in his assessment on the
    evidence of self-sufficiency. The basis of  her  submission  once  more
    amounted to an assertion that the present appellant's case is analogous
    to C-408/03 C v The Kingdom of Belgium   I  disagree  with  Miss  Khan.
    Judge Reed in his determination says at [29] and [30],

         "It is argued that Ms. Fitanoglu was a self  sufficient  person  on
         account of money that was sent to her from her relatives in Greece.
         Whilst I accept that she was sent money, the receipt of this  money
         was on the evidence before me not consistent. Further, only in  one
         year, 2005 in which, if my arithmetic is correct,  she  received  a
         total of �3387.56 (the equivalent of �65 per week) did she  receive
         anything approaching an amount  that  would  have  been  enough  to
         provide anything approaching an amount that would have been  enough
         to provide her with a basic standard of living; and this was  in  a
         year in which she jointly  signed  a  tenancy  agreement  with  Ms,
         Chacamidi with a total monthly rent of �400. In no other  year  did
         the money sent to her provide anything even approaching  the  basic
         social security subsistence levels for a single person let alone  a
         couple. Article 8 of the directive, which is headed "Administrative
         formalities for Union citizens" states at sub-paragraph 4 that:

         "Member States may not lay down a fixed amount which they regard as
         'sufficient  resources',  but  they  must  take  into  account  the
         personal situation of the  person  concerned.  In  all  cases  this
         amount shall not be higher than the threshold below which nationals
         of the host Member State become eligible for social assistance  or,
         where this criterion is not acceptable,  higher  than  the  minimum
         social security pension paid by the host Member State."

         The evidence before me does little to demonstrate that  apart  from
         in 2005 the money received by  Ms.  Fitanoglu  from  her  relatives
         could be regarded as sufficient resources. I can only conclude that
         in reality  the  only  reason  Ms  Fitanoglu  claims  to  be  self-
         sufficient during this time was because of the income earned by the
         Appellant through his work. Indeed, this was the basis of  part  of
         Miss Khan's submission: namely Ms.  Fitanoglu  was  self-sufficient
         because of the income earned by her husband the appellant.

         I received little  assistance  from  either  representative  as  to
         whether or not an EU national can claim  to  be  a  self-sufficient
         person if in fact they are just relying upon the income earned by a
         non-EEA spouse. There is no evidence before me that this  appellant
         has put forward any claim that he was entitled to be in the UK  and
         work here on any basis other than being someone who was a spouse of
         a qualified EEA national. Having considered this matter, I  do  not
         accept that an EEA national can claim  to  be  self-sufficient  and
         base such self-sufficiency upon money received in income from a non-
         EEA spouse working here in the UK in the circumstances as  set  out
         here. I was not directions  to  any  authorities,  however  similar
         issues were considered and rejected by the Tribunal as long ago  as
         2007 in AG and others (EEA-jobseeker-self-sufficient  person-proof)
         Germany [2007] UKAIT 00075 the reasons were set out as follows:

             "72. Turning to what guidance is given by  ECJ  case  law,  we
                  recognise that the Court has  frequently  emphasised  that
                  there are  limitations  contained  in  the  Community  law
                  requirement that beneficiaries of the right  of  residence
                  must not become an "unreasonable"  burden  on  the  public
                  finances of the host Member State. Mr Idowu is quite right
                  to emphasise that it is the Court's view  that:  "...those
                  limitations and conditions must be applied  in  compliance
                  with the limits imposed by Community law and in accordance
                  with  the  principle  of  proportionality"   (Chen   [32],
                  Baumbast [90] and[91]). Even so,  Mr  Idowu's  submissions
                  must be rejected. If he were correct the right  to  reside
                  of family members, despite being  described  in  both  the
                  Regulations and  the  Citizens'  Directive  as  "dependent
                  upon" those of the Union citizen  (see  for  example:  reg
                  4(2)),  could  be  created  by  the  Union  citizen  being
                  dependent  upon  them.  Both  the  Regulations   are   the
                  Citizens' Directive make very  clear  that  the  right  to
                  reside of family members is  dependent  upon  their  being
                  family members of a Union  citizen  who  can  establish  a
                  right to reside in his or her own right. Thus Article 7(2)
                  of the Directive states that:

                      The right of residence provided for  in  paragraph  1
                      shall  extend  to  family  members  who   are     not
                      nationals of a Member State, accompanying or  joining
                      the Union citizen in the host Member  State  provided
                      that such  Union  citizen  satisfies  the  conditions
                      referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b)  or  (c).(Emphasis
                      added)

               1. Put another way, the right  of  residence  of  the  family
                  member is premised upon  the  Union  citizen  being  able,
                  separately,  to   satisfy   the   requirement   of   self-
                  sufficiency.

               1. In similar fashion the right of the family member to  take
                  employment  presupposes  that  the   Union   citizen   has
                  established a right of residence in his own right. So much
                  is clear from the wording of Article 23:

                      "Irrespective of nationality, the family members of a
                      Union citizen who have the right of residence or  the
                      right of permanent residence in a Member State  shall
                      be entitled to take up employment or  self-employment
                      there. (Emphasis added) "

               1. As Buxton  LJ  identified  in  W(China)  and  X(China)  in
                  relation to the  previous  directive  dealing  with  self-
                  sufficient persons (Directive 90/364) (at [16]):

                      "As interpreted by the ECJ in Chen,  the  article  18
                      right of Q and the associated right of her custodians
                      can only be  lawfully  asserted  under  the  strictly
                      limited conditions imposed by Directive  90/364.  The
                      right accordingly does not exist if Q does  not  have
                      access to the relevant resources."

               1. It is true that the fact of  reverse  dependency  did  not
                  prevent the ECJ in Chen from finding that  a  young  minor
                  who was  a  national  of  a  Member  State  can  have  his
                  resources assessed by reference to his parents'  resources
                  [see [44] and [45]-[47]). What motivated the Court to find
                  in favour of Chen was the Treaty's  general  principle  of
                  free movement. However, in the first place  the  Court  in
                  Chen confirmed that parents  who  were  carers  could  not
                  qualify as "family members" under  Community  legislation.
                  In the second place, as the Tribunal has  pointed  out  on
                  several occasions, the resources of the  parents  in  Chen
                  were acquired separately from their economic  activity  in
                  the host State (the UK). In GM and AM [2006]  UKAIT  00059
                  the Tribunal concluded that an EU national child  and  its
                  parents could not establish EU rights of  residence  where
                  the "self-sufficiency" could only arise  through  reliance
                  upon the parents' income derived from  employment  in  the
                  UK. Its reasoning was as follows:

             "62. The solution may  be  found  in  an  examination  of  the
                  underlying purpose that leads Community law  to  recognise
                  the derivative right of free movement for  family  members
                  of EU nationals exercising Treaty rights. Those rights, of
                  course, apply to family  members  even  if  they  are  not
                  themselves EU nationals. The real purpose of the right  to
                  accompany (or join) and reside with  the  EU  national  is
                  that without  such  a  right  the  EU  national  could  be
                  inhibited from exercising his EU right  of  free  movement
                  and residence. The starting point is that the EU  national
                  has a right and therefore all principles of Community  law
                  work to avoid difficulties in  its  exercise.  It  follows
                  from that that in a typical case the EU  national's  right
                  exists independently of the presence of family members  in
                  the host country. That was also  the  situation  in  Chen.
                  Although the parent/carer had to be in the UK in order for
                  the EU national child to exercise her right of  residence,
                  that right existed independently of the  presence  of  the
                  family member. The child's  self-sufficiency  was  derived
                  from her parents but it would have existed  even  if  they
                  had not been in  the  UK  -  it  was  derived  from  their
                  business in China. The  rationale  of  Chen  is  that  the
                  presence of the parent/carer enabled the child to exercise
                  the right it undoubtedly - and independently - had.

                      63.  What  is  being  said  in  this  case  is  quite
                      different. Here, it is said that the parent/carer  is
                      entitled to be in the UK and work because  only  then
                      will the child be self-sufficient and hence establish
                      her EU right of residence. Thus, the family  member's
                      presence in the UK (and right to work) is relied upon
                      not in order to avoid a  'clog'  or  'chill'  on  the
                      exercise of the right of the EU  national  child  but
                      rather in order to create that very  right  itself  -
                      the right from which the family member then seeks  to
                      derive his own right to reside as  her  carer/parent.
                      Only if the parent/carer resides in the UK  with  the
                      EU national child can it be said that the  child  has
                      an EU right at all. The argument is then exposed  for
                      what  it  is   -   entirely   circular.   Even   more
                      problematically,  it  is  a  circular  argument  that
                      begins in the wrong place because it  begins  with  a
                      person who has no right  to  begin  with,  unlike  in
                      Chen. There is nothing  in  the  Court  of  Justice's
                      jurisprudence, in particular in Chen, or anything  in
                      principle which should cause us to decide that a non-
                      EU family member should be able to reside in  the  UK
                      with an  EU  national  child  (not  to  allow  it  to
                      exercise an existing right but rather)  in  order  to
                      establish the right in the first place. Any right  of
                      the family member must be derived  from  an  existing
                      right  of  the  EU  national  which  he  or  she  has
                      individually and separately. That is simply not  this
                      case.

                      64.  Further,  if  the  appellants'   arguments   are
                      accepted, there would be  a  number  of  consequences
                      which we consider have no justification in  Community
                      law.

                      65. First, it would mean that  an  EU  citizen  could
                      enter and reside within another Member State  on  the
                      basis of self-sufficiency providing his  accompanying
                      non-EU  family  member   could   realistically   gain
                      employment  in  the  UK.  The  family  member  would,
                      thereby, acquire a right to work equivalent  to  that
                      of an EU national  who  wished  to  work  in  another
                      Member State. That would elevate what has always been
                      necessarily a derivative right for a non-EU  national
                      into the primary right previously only enjoyed by  EU
                      nationals. In our view, the appellant cannot assert a
                      right to work (which he does not otherwise possess as
                      a non-EU national) in order to  establish  the  first
                      appellant's right of residence based upon her  'self-
                      sufficiency'. The  attempt  to  supplant  the  Member
                      State's right to  decide  upon  its  own  immigration
                      controls in this way has no foundation  in  Community
                      law.

                      66. Second, EC rights of free movement and  residence
                      were originally conceived as  rights  conferred  upon
                      the economically active, for example workers and  the
                      self-employed (Roux v Belgium (Case C-363/89)  [1991]
                      ECR I-273). Neither appellant does, nor  could,  rely
                      upon a right of this nature. Rather, they  rely  upon
                      Article 18, EC Treaty introduced  by  the  Maastricht
                      Treaty and its progeny in  the  shape  of  Directives
                      90/364 and 2004/38  which  extend  EU  free  movement
                      rights in certain circumstances  to  non-economically
                      active EU citizens  and  their  family  members.  The
                      effect of [counsel for the appellants'] argument,  if
                      correct,  would  confer   upon   an   EU   national's
                      carer/parent a right to work (the economically active
                      right) in  order  that  the  non-economically  active
                      right of the EU national could be established. We  do
                      not  consider  that  Article  18  and  the   relevant
                      Directives can be interpreted and applied  so  as  to
                      create a  right  to  work  for  the  non-EU  national
                      carer/parent in these circumstances. It  is  not,  in
                      our view, required by any of  the  Court  of  Justice
                      jurisprudence or any of the  arguments  presented  to
                      us."

               1. The reasoning in GM and AM was  also  applied  in  MA  and
                  other [2006] UKAIT 00090 when the Tribunal considered  the
                  argument that income lawfully earned in the  UK  could  be
                  relied upon. The Tribunal stated:

                      "42. ....In our view, the EU national's right must be
                      established independently  of  the  presence  of  the
                      family members in the UK before they may  derive  any
                      rights from EU law themselves. This, it may be  said,
                      is because the right is the right of the EU national.
                      It  is  an  individual  right,  not  a  family  right
                      (although it has consequences for the family); and it
                      must be established on an individual,  not  a  family
                      basis.

                      43. Second, we do not see any basis for deciding that
                      income derived from the first and second  appellants'
                      current employment  can  establish  their  daughter's
                      right to reside. The circularity in establishing  the
                      child's rights and then the  parents'  rights  is  no
                      less apparent in these  appeals.  Here,  the  child's
                      self-sufficiency  is  dependent  upon   her   parents
                      working. They only have a temporary basis  for  doing
                      so for so long as they have  limited  leave  and  are
                      permitted to work. Once that leave  runs  out,  there
                      would be no lawful  basis  for  working.  Indeed,  it
                      seems  to  us  that  it  is  only  because  of  these
                      applications and subsequent appeals  that  the  leave
                      did not terminate in December 2005 but was  continued
                      under s.3C of the  Immigration  Act  1971.  The  only
                      basis for their right to work would then have  to  be
                      derived from EU law. The  moment  that  occurred  and
                      they derived a right to reside and - it would have to
                      be said - to continue working, the position would  be
                      indistinguishable  from  that  in  GM  and  AM.   The
                      circularity would be complete - their right  to  work
                      would now sustain the child's right and  through  her
                      their own derived right would continue.

                      44. Third,  our  conclusion  accords  with  a  proper
                      understanding of the notion of 'self-sufficiency' and
                      the distinction between  free  movement  in  reliance
                      upon  economic   and,   alternatively,   non-economic
                      rights.

                      45. An EU national who claims to  be  self-sufficient
                      is not asserting a  right  to  enter  and  reside  in
                      another EU state on the basis of economic activity in
                      that country. If he were,  he  would  be  seeking  to
                      enter, for example,  as  a  worker  or  self-employed
                      person. Rather, he relies upon  his  resources  which
                      exist independently of any economic activity  in  the
                      host Member state.  Once  that  is  established,  his
                      family members have a derivative right  to  accompany
                      or join him. If they did not, the EU national's right
                      of free movement might be  inhibited  or  effectively
                      denied  to  him.  In   addition,   the   central   EU
                      legislative instruments give family members  a  right
                      to work in that the host  Member  state.  But,  their
                      right to work is not a recognition of  the  right  to
                      engage in economic activity per  se.  Rather,  it  is
                      simply a reflection of the underlying principle of EU
                      law  because  otherwise  they  (and  hence   the   EU
                      national) might be inhibited from moving  within  the
                      EU if family members were not allowed  to  carry  on,
                      what for  them,  is  an  important  aspect  of  their
                      everyday lives. The economic activity of  the  family
                      members does not establish -  nor  could  it  in  the
                      context of an EU  national  worker  or  self-employed
                      person - the  EU  national's  right.  That  arises  a
                      priori and independently of any economic activity  by
                      the EU national or his family in the host EU country.



                      46.  By  contrast,  in  the  Chen-type  case  the  EU
                      national can only establish  his  right  by  reliance
                      upon economic activity in the host Member state, not,
                      of course, economic activity by himself but rather by
                      his family members. We see no reason to  distort  the
                      usual situation simply because the EU national  is  a
                      child and is dependent upon others for  support  and,
                      unusually, is already present in the host EU  country
                      with his family members rather than seeking to  enter
                      it with his family.  Here  too,  the  right  of  free
                      movement based upon  self-sufficiency  cannot  depend
                      upon resources derived from employment engaged in  by
                      the EU national or his family members in the UK.

                      ...

                      48. In the result, therefore, the  reasoning  of  the
                      Tribunal in GM and  AM  is  applicable  where  an  EU
                      national child places reliance  upon  income  derived
                      from a parent lawfully working in  the  UK  during  a
                      period of limited leave  restricted  for  a  specific
                      purpose or,  which  is  not  this  case,  who  is  on
                      temporary admission and not prohibited from  working.
                      In such circumstances, a Member State is entitled  to
                      restrict  the  rights   of   employment   of   non-EU
                      nationals, in particular to  limit  the  duration  of
                      their permission to  work  just  as  it  is  entitled
                      effectively to prohibit their ability to  work  (see,
                      W(China)  and  X(China)).  When  it  does  so,   that
                      individual cannot derive  a  right  to  reside  as  a
                      "family member" of an EU national because that income
                      cannot be taken into account in  order  to  establish
                      the EU national's  right  of  residence  on  a  self-
                      sufficient basis."

               1. Before moving away from relevant  case  law,  we  need  to
                  address  one  further  ECJ  case.  It  is  Case  C-408/03,
                  Commission v Belgium 23 March 2006. It was not cited to us
                  by either of the parties but since  it  is  the  only  ECJ
                  judgment to deal post-Chen with the issue  of  sufficiency
                  of personal resources it is imperative that we analyse it,
                  to see whether our reasoning is  compatible  with  it.  It
                  concerned an action brought by the Commission  in  respect
                  of the requirement  imposed  by  the  Kingdom  of  Belgium
                  making the right of residence of family members  of  Union
                  citizens  subject  to  the  requirement  that  they   have
                  sufficient personal resources. According to the case  file
                  the Court noted that the Commission had  received  various
                  complaints about Belgian  legislation  and  administrative
                  practice  concerning  both  the  conditions  for  granting
                  residence permits under Directive  90/364  and  orders  to
                  leave Belgian territory issued to citizens of  the  Union.
                  The Commission was said to have been  particularly  struck
                  by the situation  of  a  Portuguese  national,  a  Mrs  De
                  Figueiredo,  who  had  entered  Belgium  with  her   three
                  daughters in August 1999 to live  with  her  long-standing
                  partner,  a  Belgian  national.  There  was  seemingly  no
                  dispute that the Belgian national had sufficient means  to
                  support her and her children, but the Belgian  authorities
                  ordered her to leave on the ground that she did not fulfil
                  the requirement  of  sufficient  resources  laid  down  in
                  Article 1  of  the  Directive  90/364,  stating  that  the
                  undertaking to support her given by him did not constitute
                  evidence that she  had  sufficient  resources.  The  Court
                  ruled, inter alia, that:

                      "by excluding the income of a partner residing in the
                      host Member State in  the  absence  of  an  agreement
                      concluded  before  a   notary   and   containing   an
                      assistance clause, the Kingdom of Belgium has  failed
                      to  fulfil  its  obligations  under  Article  18  and
                      Council Directive 90/364 of 28 June 1990 on the right
                      of  residence  when  applying   that   directive   to
                      nationals of a Member State who wish to rely on their
                      rights under the directive and on Article 18 EC".

               1. We do not think this ruling assists the instant cases. The
                  resources of the family member in  question  consisted  in
                  income lawfully earned by a national of  the  host  Member
                  State (her Belgian partner), not income earned  unlawfully
                  by a third-country national. Neither this judgment nor the
                  judgment in  Chen  can  be  taken  to  support  the  quite
                  different  proposition  that   self-sufficiency   can   be
                  established by income earned by the  family  member  of  a
                  Union citizen - irrespective of whether  that  income  was
                  earned lawfully and on the basis of an  independent  right
                  to work (see GM and AM at [52]).

               1. Of  course,  none  of  the  above  decisions  specifically
                  addresses reg 4(4) of  the  2006  Regulations.  This  fact
                  obliges us to consider Mr Idowu's separate contention that
                  the Directive permits Member States to introduce or retain
                  more  favourable  provisions  (Article  37)  and  that   -
                  irrespective of what the Directive provides - the  wording
                  of reg 4(4) denotes that the EEA  national  can  establish
                  self-sufficiency by reliance  on  the  non-EEA  national's
                  earnings.

               1. However, it does not seem to us that the  meaning  of  reg
                  4(4) is that the self-sufficiency of an EEA  national  can
                  be established by aggregating his resources and  those  of
                  his  family  member(s)  -irrespective   of   whether   the
                  resources of  the  family  member(s)  have  been  lawfully
                  acquired. Its purpose is  twofold.  First  it  establishes
                  that the family as a group must be self-sufficient: it  is
                  not enough for the EEA national's resources to cover  only
                  what is necessary for his personal support. Second, it  is
                  intended to identify  the  level  at  which  the  family's
                  resources  are  to  be  assessed,  by  reference  to   the
                  eligibility threshold  for  social  assistance  under  the
                  United  Kingdom  benefit  system.   Nor   can   the   word
                  "resources"  be  read  as  having  no  limitations  beyond
                  allowing all or any resources to be taken into account. It
                  cannot extend, for example, to ill-gotten gains of a fraud
                  or other crime. If it did it would violate  the  Community
                  law principle that rights must not be abused: see  Centros
                  Ltd  v  Erhvervs-og  Selskabestyrelssen  (Case   C-212/97)
                  [1999] ECR I-1459, Citizens' Directive, Article 35.

               1. We have also considered Mr Idowu's  reliance  on  the  IDI
                  entry at para 5. However, as he himself  acknowledged,  we
                  have to apply the Regulations and the IDIs are at most  an
                  aid to construction of the Regulations. Secondly what  the
                  relevant passage in para 5 contemplates is a spouse, civil
                  partner or partner  able  to  support  the  Union  citizen
                  through   "legal   employment/self-employment"   (emphasis
                  added).  That  does  not  assist  a  family  member  whose
                  employment is only legal if the right  to  reside  of  the
                  Union citizen has been shown to  exist  on  the  basis  of
                  his/her personal self-sufficiency. It may be  under  these
                  policy  instructions  that  the  position  is   considered
                  different if the spouse,  civil  partner  or  partner  has
                  sufficient  financial  resources  to  support  them   both
                  without  the  need  to  undertake  employment   or   self-
                  employment (as in Case C-408/03,  Commission  v  Belgium),
                  but that is not the case here  and  this  provision  seems
                  consistent with the approach  of  the  European  Court  of
                  Justice in Chen of  permitting  account  to  be  taken  of
                  resources which such persons have before they come to  the
                  host Member State.

               1. Accordingly the  evidence  before  the  immigration  judge
                  failed to establish that the first appellant was either  a
                  jobseeker or worker or self-sufficient person.  The  first
                  appellant not being a qualified person, his family members
                  did not have a right to reside. All three, therefore, were
                  properly refused the confirmatory documentation which they
                  sought in the form of a registration certificate (for  the
                  first appellant) and a residence card for  the  first  and
                  second appellants. Hence the immigration judge, whilst  he
                  erred in law, did not err materially."

14. The Appellant's case is not analogous to the case of C-408/03 C  v  The
    Kingdom of Belgium, because what is submitted by Miss Khan  has  to  be
    read in the context of paragraph 79 of AG  and  Others  (EEA-jobseeker-
    self-sufficient person-proof) Germany [2007] UKAIT 00075.

15. In my judgment, the FtT was entitled to place reliance on AG and Others
    particularly in view of paragraph 72 and 73 of that  judgment  set  out
    above.

16. Miss Khan developed no further points before me in accordance with  the
    last  line of UTJ Macleman's grant of permission. The determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal is a thorough and fully reasoned one. There  is
    no error of law disclosed.

Decision

17. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  stands.  This  appeal  is
    dismissed

No anonymity direction is made.
