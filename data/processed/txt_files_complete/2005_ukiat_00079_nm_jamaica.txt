Representation:

For the appellant:      Ms Laleen Scott, Sponsor.
For the respondent:     Mr A Sheikh, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who  appeals  to  the  Tribunal
      with permission against the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr  D  M
      Brennan, promulgated on 4 March  2004,  in  which  he  dismissed  her
      appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision of  2 November
      2003 refusing entry clearance for the purpose of a family visit.


2.    The appellant wished to visit a lady she described as her  sister-in-
      law,(                )  ,  who  lives  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
      Adjudicator concluded at paragraph 8 of his  determination  that  the
      relationship between the appellant  and  (            )had  not  been
      defined.   Since the appellant had no husband, if they were  sisters-
      in-law it could only be because (              ) was the  appellant's
      brother's wife.   The Adjudicator, however, would have expected them,
      if that was the case, to have the same surname.  He  considered  that
      it would only be the case if the appellant were  applying  for  entry
      clearance in order to visit her husband's wife that the  relationship
      would qualify  under  Regulation  2(1)  of  the  Immigration  Appeals
      (Family Visits) Regulations 2003.  Otherwise  he  saw  no  reason  to
      doubt the appellant's  explanation  of  her  personal  and  financial
      circumstances and did not consider that the  reasons  for  her  visit
      cast any doubt on her good faith.  He accepted that the appellant and
      (          )have a close relationship and did  not  consider  that  (
            ) offer to pay for the trip called the  purpose  of  the  visit
      into question.  If she had a right of appeal then he would have  been
      disposed to allow it.

3.    In the grounds of appeal it is contended  that  the  relationship  is
      that of a sister-in-law owing to the common-law relationship  between
      the applicant and  the  sponsor's  brother.   It  is  said  that  the
      appellant and her common-law husband have a son  who  is  now  twenty
      four years old and the relationship is subsisting and  therefore  the
      sponsor is clearly the sister-in-law of the appellant as stated.   It
      is  suggested  that  the  Adjudicator  confused  himself  with  legal
      marriages as being the only situation concerning  which  the  sponsor
      could be the sister-in-law of the appellant.   Permission  to  appeal
      was granted on  the  basis  that  it  was  arguable  that  common-law
      relationships fall  within  the  aegis  of  the  Immigration  Appeals
      (Family Visitor) Regulations.

4.    At the hearing before us(                 ), the sponsor, appeared on
      behalf of the appellant, and Mr A Sheikh appeared on  behalf  of  the
      Entry Clearance Officer.

5.    (           ) said that in common-law terms she saw the appellant  as
      her sister-in-law.   The appellant had acted on her behalf  when  the
      witness's father was ill and also visited  the  witness's  sister  in
      Jamaica who is handicapped and kept in touch with her.  She  saw  the
      appellant as a member of the family and the reason for  inviting  her
      was to thank her.

6.    Mr Sheikh argued that the literal approach  to  the  law  had  to  be
      adopted and "spouse" had to be  interpreted  as  meaning  husband  or
      wife.

7.    This  appeal  raises  a  short  point  on  the  construction  of  the
      Immigration Appeals (Family Visitor) Regulations 2003.

8.    Regulation 2 of those Regulations states as follows:

      2(1)   For  the  purposes  of  Section  90(1)  of  the   Nationality,
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, a "member  of  the  applicant's
           family" is any of the following persons -


           (a)   the applicant's spouse, father,  brother,  son,  daughter,
                 grandfather,   grandmother,    grandson,    granddaughter,
                 brother, sister,  uncle,  aunt,  nephew,  niece  or  first
                 cousin;


           (b)   the father, mother, brother, or sister of the  applicant's
                 spouse;


           (c)   the spouse of the applicant's son or daughter;


           (d)     the   applicant's   stepfather,   stepmother,   stepson,
                 stepdaughter, stepbrother or stepsister; or


           (e)   the person with whom the applicant has lived as the member
                 of an unmarried couple for at least  two  to  three  years
                 before  the  day  on  which  his  application  for   entry
                 clearance was made.


8.    We agree with Mr Sheikh that the word "spouse" in Regulation  2(1)(b)
      can only properly be interpreted  as  meaning  husband  or  wife.   (
      )cannot properly be  described  as  the  sister  of  the  applicant's
      spouse.  (        ) is not married to her brother, though it is clear
      from what she has said that their relationship  is  a  long  standing
      one.  It is nevertheless the  case  that  the  word  "spouse"  has  a
      specific meaning.   It is perhaps relevant to note also that,  as  we
      have set out at  Regulation  (2)(1)(e),  provision  is  made  for  an
      applicant to visit a person with whom they have lived as a member  of
      an unmarried couple in certain circumstances, and  we  consider  that
      this  clearly  contrasts  with  the  use  of  the  word  "spouse"  in
      Regulation 2(1)(b).   Accordingly we conclude that Mr Sheikh is right
      to contend that the literal interpretation of the  word  "spouse"  is
      required to be adopted in this case and  therefore  this  application
      falls outside the Regulations.   We endorse the Adjudicator's  regret
      at this situation in this particular case, given  the  clearly  sound
      reasons for (       ) to make the offer to (          )to  visit  her
      and  the  absence  of  any  doubt  as  to  the  good  faith  of  this
      application.   Nevertheless we must apply the law as it is, and as  a
      consequence it is clear  that  there  is  no  error  of  law  in  the
      Adjudicator's determination, and  accordingly  this  appeal  must  be
      dismissed.
