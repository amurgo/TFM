                            DECISION AND REASONS


THE HISTORY OF THE APPEAL

1.   The Appellant, who was born on [ ] 1935 and who is now  81  years  old,
    is a citizen of Syria.  On  1  June  2014  she  applied  to  visit  her
    daughter in the United Kingdom. Her daughter is a British citizen.  The
    Appellant's  application  was  refused  on  14  June  2014.  The  Entry
    Clearance Officer took into account  the  fact  that  there  had   been
    explosions in her local area in Damascus and that she  had  transferred
    some savings to the United Kingdom.  Therefore, he concluded  that  she
    was not a genuine visitor and did not intend to return at  the  end  of
    her proposed visit.

2.   The Appellant appealed on 22 July 2014 and said  that  she  had  always
    left the United Kingdom at the end of her visits  and  that,  when  she
    came to  visit  the  United  Kingdom  in  2012,  Syria  was  also  very
    politically volatile. She explained that she transferred  some  of  her
    savings to the United Kingdom because the Syrian lira was losing  value
    day by day and she was seeking to protect her savings. In addition, she
    asserted that refusing to allow her  to  visit  her  daughter  and  her
    family breached Article 8 of the European Convention on  Human  Rights.



3.   On 18 November 2014 the Entry Clearance Manager confirmed the  decision
    and asserted that the situation in Syria had significantly changed  for
    the worst since 2012 in Syria and speculated that money could have been
    transferred to Lebanon or  Jordan.   He  also  said  that  he  did  not
    understand the basis on which she asserted her Article 8  rights  would
    be breached.

4.   Her appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Hanbury  on  10  March
    2015 but unfortunately neither the judge nor counsel for the Respondent
    addressed the fact that appeal  rights  for  visitors  had  changed  as
    section 88A of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  had
    been amended by section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 on 25  June
    2013 so that the Appellant was only entitled to appeal on human  rights
    and/or racial discrimination grounds.

5.   The Respondent appealed and was granted permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson on 12 May 2014. I
    set aside First-tier Tribunal Judge Hanbury's decision at an  error  of
    law hearing on 25 September 2015 and retained the  case  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal for a  de  novo  hearing.   As  the  Appellant  had  not  been
    represented at the error of law hearing, I listed the case for  a  case
    management hearing to  enable  the  Appellant  to  take  further  legal
    advice.  At  the  case  management  hearing  on  11  January  2016  the
    Appellant indicated that she wished to continue with her appeal.

6.   The de novo hearing was initially set down for 13  June  2016  but  the
    Appellant did not receive notice of the hearing  and  did  not  attend.
    There was also no interpreter  present.   Therefore,  I  adjourned  the
    hearing until today.


THE SUBSTANTIVE HEARING

7.   At this hearing it was submitted  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent  that
    Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights was not engaged
    as the Appellant's daughter  had  lived  here  for  12  years  and  the
    Appellant had rarely visited her. He also said that  there  was  little
    evidence of dependency and  noted  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  held  in
    Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) that  it
    would only be in very unusual circumstances that a person other than  a
    close relative would  be  able  to  show  that  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance comes within the scope of Article 8(1) of the ECHR.

8.   He also relied on the fact that in  Kaur  (visit  appeals;  Article  8)
    [2015] UKUT 4878 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held that unless an appellant
    can show that there  are  individual  interests  at  stake  covered  by
    Article 8 "of a particular pressing nature" so as to  give  rise  to  a
    "strong claim that compelling circumstances may exist  to  justify  the
    grant of LTE (Leave to Enter) outside the rules":  (see  SS  (Congo)  &
    Others v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    387)".

9.   In response it was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that  the  test
    to engage Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights was a
    "modest" one. It was also submitted that in Mostafa the Upper  Tribunal
    had also found that it would be "extremely foolish to be attempt to  be
    prescriptive, given the intensely factual and contextual sensitivity of
    every case". In addition, the Appellant's representative said  that  it
    was not necessary to consider whether the  decision  was  proportionate
    because she met the requirements of paragraph  41  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and therefore any  breach  of  her  Article  8  rights  would  be
    unlawful. In the alternative,  he  argued  that  any  breach  would  be
    disproportionate.

DECISION

10.  In Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT  0261  (IAC)  the  Upper
    Tribunal found that "the first question to be addressed  in  an  appeal
    against refusal to grant entry clearance as a visitor where only  human
    rights grounds are available is  whether  article  8  of  the  ECHR  is
    engaged at all. When addressing this question, I have  reminded  myself
    that in paragraph 28 of AG (Eritrea) v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2007] EWCA Civ 801 Sedley LJ found that "it follows, in our
    judgment, that while an interference with private and family life  must
    be real if it is to engage article 8(1), the  threshold  of  engagement
    (the "minimum level") is not a specially high one".

11.  The Respondent submitted that  the  Appellant  had  not  been  able  to
    establish that the Appellant enjoyed a family life  with  her  daughter
    and grandchildren in the United Kingdom.  He based this on  the  length
    of time the Appellant's daughter had been living here and the fact that
    the Appellant  had  only  visited  her  on  three  previous  occasions.
    However, in my view the circumstances are more complex.  The  Appellant
    visited her mother every two years between 2008 and 2012 and would have
    visited her in 2014 (and arguably in 2016) if she had not been  refused
    entry clearance. In addition, when she did visit her  she  visited  her
    for between two and three months and on one of those visits her  mother
    moved in with her at her rented accommodation so that they could better
    enjoy their time together. I have also reminded myself that in  Mostafa
    (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC)   the  President
    warned against taking too prescriptive an approach and that he did  not
    rule out the fact that in some cases relationships  could  come  within
    the scope of Article 8(1) because of their very unusual  circumstances.
    It is my view that the age of the Appellant and the fact  that  she  is
    living in a country being torn apart by civil war and to which it would
    not be reasonable for her  daughter  and  grandchildren  to  visit  are
    factors  which  are  capable  of  amounting  to   such   very   unusual
    circumstances.

12.  The centrality of these visits to the  maintenance  of  a  family  life
    between the Appellant and her daughter and also the Appellant  and  her
    grandchildren  is  underpinned  by  the  fact  that,  in  the   current
    circumstances which exist in Syria and that area of the Middle East, it
    is  not  reasonable  to  suggest  that  the  Appellant's  daughter  and
    grandchildren could visit her there.  On the  basis  of  this  and  the
    totality of the particular circumstances of this case, I find that  the
    low threshold to engage Article 8(1)  of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights has been met.

13.  I have then taken into account the various steps to  be  addressed  for
    the purposes of Article 8(2) of the ECHR. Firstly,  I  have  considered
    whether the decision  reached  was  in  accordance  with  the  law.  In
    particular, I have considered whether the Appellant was  able  to  meet
    the requirements of paragraph 41 of the Immigration  Rules.  The  Entry
    Clearance Officer doubted that the Appellant was a genuine  visitor  or
    that she intended to return to Syria at the end of her proposed visit.

14.  It is my view that, when he considered these questions, he should  have
    taken into account her age and the fact  that  she  was  settled  in  a
    Government controlled area of Damascus and had not sought to flee  from
    this area to a neighbouring country or any other part of Europe at  any
    time during the present civil war.  He  should  also  have  taken  into
    account that she had returned to Syria after a  visit  to  her  sponsor
    after the conflict had already begun. In addition, he would  have  been
    aware from previous applications that the Appellant's husband  remained
    in Syria and was no longer seeking to visit with her on this  occasion.
    He also failed to take into account that the proposed visit was part of
    a pattern of visits which had occurred in the past, as noted above.

15.  Instead, the Entry Clearance Officer had relied on the  fact  that  the
    Appellant lived in an area of Damascus targeted by rebel groups but  he
    had not taken into account the nature of  his  area  and  its  relative
    security because it was  protected by Government forces.

16.  He also relied on the fact that the Appellant  had  paid  some  savings
    into a bank in the United Kingdom. He noted that the Appellant had said
    that because of the civil unrest in Syria it was safer to do so. He did
    not explain why this was an indication that  the  Appellant  would  not
    return to Syria as opposed to a means by which she  could  protect  her
    savings and ensure that she would be able to maintain herself  and  her
    husband in Syria.

17.  He did not doubt the veracity of the title deeds submitted  in  support
    of her application but merely noted that she had not provided  evidence
    to show that they did not generate the income asserted.  In my view any
    such evidential shortcoming should be viewed in the context  of  repeat
    visits and returns by the Appellant and her husband in the past and the
    fact that it was her unchallenged  evidence  that  her  other  children
    remained in Syria.

18.  The Entry Clearance Officer also doubted that the  Appellant  would  be
    able to maintain and accommodate  herself  during  her  proposed  visit
    without recourse to public funds.  This was  despite  evidence  that  a
    deposit had been paid on a flat that she proposed to rent for her visit
    between 15 June 2014 and 1 September 2014 and that on  previous  visits
    she had rented  her  own  accommodation  as  opposed  to  staying  with
    relatives. This in my view  indicates  a  person  who  was  financially
    secure. As did the fact that she had a balance  of  �52,856.32  in  her
    personal bank account with the NatWest in  Edgware.  Therefore,  in  my
    view there was no basis upon which  to  conclude  that  she  could  not
    maintain and accommodate herself during her proposed visit.

19.  As a consequence, I find that  the  Appellant  was  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules for the  purposes
    of Article 8(2) of the Immigration  Rules  and  that  the  decision  to
    refuse her entry clearance was not in accordance with these Rules.

20.  In the alternative,  I  have  considered  whether,  in  any  event  the
    decision to refuse the Appellant entry clearance  was  disproportionate
    for the purposes of Article 8(2) of the ECHR. When  doing  so,  I  have
    reminded myself that in Kaur (visit appeals;  Article  8)  [2015]  UKUT
    00487 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal found that "in visit appeals the Article
    8 decision on an appeal cannot be made in a vacuum. Whilst judges  only
    have jurisdiction to decide whether the decision is unlawful under  s.6
    of the Human Rights Act 1998 (or shows  unlawful  discrimination)  (see
    Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  00112  (IAC)  and
    Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261  (IAC),  the  starting
    point for deciding that must be the state of  the  evidence  about  the
    appellant's ability to meet the requirements of  paragraph  41  of  the
    immigration rules".

21.  I also note that in Adjei the Upper Tribunal held that  "if  article  8
    is engaged, the Tribunal may need to look at the extent  to  which  the
    claimant is said to meet the requirements of the rule because that  may
    inform the proportionality balancing exercise". For the  reasons  given
    above,  it  is  my  view  that  the  Appellant  is  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.

22.  When weighing up the proportionality balance I have taken into  account
    the need to maintain strict immigration controls but, as noted above, I
    have found that  the  Appellant  does  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. I have also taken into account  the  fact  that  the
    Respondent accepts that the  Appellant  was  previously  granted  visit
    visas which were valid for six months on each occasion  in  2008,  2010
    and 2012. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on these visas on
    27 February 2008, 13 June 2010 and 4 July 2012. On  each  occasion  she
    remained between two and three months and left well  before  her  visas
    expired.

23.  I have also taken into account that because of the Appellant's age  and
    the very dangerous location of her home, any delay caused by having  to
    make a fresh application for a visitor's visas may lead to a  situation
    where any  such  visa  may  become  a  nullity  and  her  daughter  and
    grandchildren are denied any contact or development of family  life  of
    any sort.

24.  As a consequence, I also find that the refusal to grant  the  Appellant
    a visa  to  visit  her  daughter  and  grandchildren  gave  rise  to  a
    disproportionate breach of their family life rights for the purposes of
    Article 8 of the ECHR.


Decision

The Appellant's appeal is allowed on the basis that  the  refusal  to  grant
her a visit visa  amounted  to  a  breach  of  Article  8  of  the  European
Convention on Human Rights.
