For the Appellant:     Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Respondent in person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The SSHD appeals against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Thorne, allowing an appeal against refusal of  an  application
       as a "highly skilled person" under the Regulations  referred  to  in
       the SSHD's letter of 4 February 2013.


    2. The point made in the SSHD's ground of appeal is correct, within the
       terms of the Regulations.  The judge erred thereon at paragraph  18.
       However, the judge in the alternative would have allowed the  appeal
       under the UKBA's published policy ("IDI") which allowed her to  rely
       upon a letter from the  institution  responsible  for  awarding  her
       qualification.

    3. The scope of the Regulations has been  widened  under  a  policy  by
       which the SSHD binds herself.

    4. The SSHD's appeal to the UT is dismissed.  The determination of  the
       First-tier Tribunal, allowing Ms Donose's appeal, shall stand.

    5. No order for anonymity has been requested or made.

    6. The appellant ought not to have been put to the  trouble  of  either
       stage of appeal.  Any available fee award in her  favour  should  be
       made.
