                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



     1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran who appeals with  leave  against
        the determination of an Adjudicator (Mr M D Oakley) dismissing  his
        appeal against the respondent's  refusal  to  recognise  him  as  a
        refugee or to grant him leave to remain on human rights grounds.

     2. At the  hearing,  Miss  L  Elliott  of  Counsel  appeared  for  the
        appellant.   Ms  A  Sellers,  Home   Office   Presenting   Officer,
        represented the respondent.

     3. The Grounds  of  Appeal  argue  that  the  adjudicator  applied  an
        incorrect standard of proof;  that his approach to the  appellant's
        Dervish religion is defective in that he says it was raised at  the
        last minute, whereas in fact great detail was given in the SEF; and
        that the adjudicator proceeded under a misapprehension  as  to  the
        cause of the appellant's fear.   By  April  2001,  he  was  clearly
        stating that  he  feared  the  Khatami  party.   The  Adjudicator's
        failure to take into account  Gashi  was  not  pursued  before  us.
        Leave to  appeal  was  granted,  with  specific  reference  to  the
        Manastry issue.

     4.  The  Manastry  religion  is  also  known  as  Manastry  and  is  a
        denomination of Islam.  The  Islamic  Government  closed  down  the
        temples, as the  practice  of  Manastry  did  not  conform  to  the
        official religion in Iran.  The appellant operated a printing press
        and printed leaflets  promoting  candidates  for  Khatami's  party.
        Members of the opposition party came to his office and broke up the
        printing machine.  They harassed him.  He left Iran on 19 May 2000,
        arriving in the  United  Kingdom  a  month  later.  In  June  2001,
        President Khatami returned to power,  but  the  appellant  did  not
        return to Iran.

     5. The appellant's Dervish or Manastry religion was  asserted  in  the
        Statement of Evidence Form (SEF).  On that basis, the Adjudicator's
        negative credibility finding on the appellant's religion looks less
        sustainable.  That is compounded by the unfortunate phrase  in  the
        Adjudicator's  determination  'even  if   credible,   the   overall
        plausibility of the appellant's account does not convince me'.  The
        standard is not whether the appellant can convince the Adjudicator,
        but  whether  there  is  a  reasonable  degree  of  likelihood   or
        substantial grounds for believing that there  is  a  real  risk  of
        prosecution or a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention  on
        Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 (torture, cruel  inhuman
        or degrading treatment or punishment).

     6. The appellant's account has changed from a fear of those opposed to
        President Khatami,  to  one  of  President  Khatami's  party.   The
        Adjudicator  rightly  regarded  that  as  seriously  damaging   his
        credibility.  The appellant seeks to  challenge  the  Adjudicator's
        negative credibility finding on the language above, and  the  novel
        concept that the issue of credibility has no relevance in  deciding
        whether or not the facts amount to persecution.

     7. For the appellant, Miss Elliott  submitted  that  the  difficulties
        which the appellant had experienced  amounted  to  persecution  and
        that on return he would be exposed to particularly harsh treatment.
         She reasserted the appellants' subjective fear, relying on page  2
        of 24 of the US State Department  Report  for  2001,  published  in
        2002.   The  appeal  should  be  remitted  for  clear   credibility
        findings.

     8. For the  respondent,  Miss  Sellers  argued  that  the  appellant's
        religious problems  had  only  recently  been  asserted.   That  is
        factually  incorrect.   She  contended   that   the   Adjudicator's
        credibility findings  were  sound  and  well-reasoned,  though  she
        accepted that  the  language  was  unfortunate.    The  appellant's
        account simply did not get him home, even if taken at its  highest.



     9. The country evidence showed that the  Iranian  Government  was  not
        prepared to  register  the  Dervish  religion.   That  was  clearly
        discrimination, but it was a long way short of  Article  3  of  the
        ECHR or persecution under the Refugee Convention.

    10. Such problems as the appellant had experienced with the  supporters
        of former President Khameini in 2000 arose only out of his printing
        leaflets, and there was no evidence of continuing interest  in  him
        by the present rï¿½gime. There had been significant  improvements  in
        the general situation in  Iran,  and  President  Khatami  had  been
        returned to power with a landslide victory (77%).   Paragraph  3.29
        of the CIPU Report for October 2002 gave details of  the  election.
        She asked the Tribunal to dismiss the appeal.

    11. In reply, Miss Elliott relied on the US State Department Report for
        its evidence of the lack of independence of the judiciary in  Iran.
        The appellant would not receive a fair trial.   She  accepted  that
        there was no evidence more up-to-date than 2001.

    12. The Tribunal reserved its determination for postal delivery,  which
        we now give.  We have considered carefully the undoubted  error  in
        the standard of proof to which  we  have  referred.   We  therefore
        considered this appeal on the basis that the appellant falls to  be
        treated as a credible Manastry who  experienced  difficulties  from
        the opponents of President Khatami in Iran in 2000 before coming to
        the United Kingdom.

    13. We have considered the evidence in the US State Department  Report.
        The issue of judicial independence  is  not  relevant  unless  this
        appellant is likely to be charged.  At page 16 of  24,  the  report
        records that as  long  ago  as  November  1999,  President  Khatami
        publicly stated that no-one in the  country  should  be  persecuted
        because of his or her religious beliefs, and that he  would  defend
        the civil rights of all citizens, regardless of  their  beliefs  or
        religion.   Other  than  that,  there  is  no  indication  of   the
        Government's attitude to followers of the Manastry religion.   This
        report covers only the first  six  months  or  President  Khatami's
        current term of four years.

    14. The CIPU Report for October 2002  is  of  little  more  assistance.
        Dervishes are not a protected religious minority but and paragraphs
        5.40-5.42 set out religious discrimination.  However, there has not
        been  any  assertion  that  this   appellant   suffered   religious
        persecution in Iran, nor that he is inclined to  proselytise.   The
        absence of any evidence in  either  of  these  leading  reports  of
        problems for followers of the Manastry religion indicates  that  in
        all probability, there are none, apart from some discrimination  as
        set out above.

    15. Following Ahsan Ullah and Thi Lien Do [2002]  EWCA  Civ  1856,  the
        prospect on return of mere  discrimination  is  not  sufficient  to
        engage the European Convention  on  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental
        Freedoms 1950.

    16. In relation to the alleged political problems, on  any  view,  this
        appellant does not appear to be able to decide whether his fear  is
        of the opposition or the national security  forces.   There  is  no
        evidence of pursuit after his departure in  2000,  and  given  that
        President Khatami is once more in power, we are  not  satisfied  to
        any standard that there is any present risk to this appellant.

    17. This appeal is dismissed.

                                                                 28 May 2004
