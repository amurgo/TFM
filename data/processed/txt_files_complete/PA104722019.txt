                            DECISION AND REASONS

   Decision made under rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
                                 Rules 2008

 1. This is an appeal  against  a  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Fox ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 11 September 2020  by
    which the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent  to
    refuse her leave to remain in this country on international  protection
    grounds was refused.

 2. By a decision sent to the parties on 18  October  2020  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Martin granted the appellant permission to appeal on all  grounds
    advanced.

 3. The appellant's legal representatives are ATM Law Solicitors, Ilford.


Rule 34

 4. By means  of  her  'rule  24'  response  dated  2  November  2020,  the
    respondent confirmed that she did not oppose the appellant's appeal  at
    the error of law stage and requested that the matter be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 5. By correspondence dated 10 November 2020, ATM Law Solicitors  confirmed
    upon behalf of the appellant that she agreed with the approach  adopted
    by the respondent.

 6. In considering whether  to  proceed  under  rule  34  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 ('the 2008 Rules') I  am  mindful
    as to the circumstances when an oral hearing is to be held in order  to
    comply with the common law duty of fairness and as to when  a  decision
    may appropriately be made consequent to a paper  consideration:  Osborn
    v. The Parole Board  [2013]  UKSC  61;  [2014]  AC  1115  and  JCWI  v.
    President of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) [2020]
    EWHC 3103 (Admin), at [6.1 - 6.14].

 7. In the circumstances and being  mindful  of  the  importance  of  these
    proceedings to the appellant, the identified position of the respondent
    and the overriding objective that the Tribunal deal with  cases  fairly
    and justly, I am satisfied that it is just and appropriate  to  proceed
    under rule 34 of the 2008 Rules.

Anonymity

 8. The Judge issued an anonymity direction. Neither party  requested  that
    the direction be set aside, and I confirm it at the conclusion of  this
    decision. I  do  so  in  order  to  avoid  the  appellant's  claim  for
    international protection becoming publicly known.

Background

 9. The appellant is a national of Vietnam. She asserts that she is fearful
    of the Vietnamese authorities consequent to  her  activities  with  the
    Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for  Democracy  ('YVD'),  an  organisation
    seeking political reform in Vietnam.

10. She relies upon her attendance at two demonstrations and also upon  her
    having distributed a banned book at school which led to the arrest of a
    friend and the authorities issuing a summons in her name.

First-tier Tribunal decision

11. The appellant's appeal came before the Judge sitting at Birmingham on 3
    September 2020. The Judge found the appellant to be  incredible  as  to
    her claimed history of political activism in Vietnam and subsequent sur
    place activity in the United Kingdom: ï¿½100 of the decision.

Grounds of appeal

12. The appellant relies upon two grounds of appeal, drafted by Mr.  Dhanji
    of Counsel, who represented her before the First-tier Tribunal.  Ground
    1 can properly be identified as encompassing seven separate challenges:

         i)   Material errors of law when considering credibility:


             a)  Failure  to  properly  take  account  of  the  appellant's
                evidence;


             b) Failure to provide adequate reasons for  material  findings
                of fact;


             c) Unlawful reliance upon the use  of  false  documents  in  a
                previous application where such assertion did not form part
                of the respondent's case and the Judge  did  not  draw  the
                appellant's attention to such concern;


             d) Making findings as to inconsistencies in evidence where  no
                such inconsistencies arose;


             e) Failing to take into account  the  respondent's  acceptance
                that the appellant displayed a good knowledge of the YVD;


             f) Unlawfully requiring corroborative evidence  that  was  not
                reasonably available to the appellant;


             g) Failure to take proper account of a country expert evidence
                relied upon by the appellant.


        ii)   Failure to adequately resolve the appellant's sur place claim.

13. In granting permission to appeal UTJ Martin  succinctly  addressed  the
    grounds advanced:

         '2.     It  is  arguable  that   the   judge   erred   in   finding
             inconsistencies which were not,  in  failing  to  consider  the
             expert's report as to the close  links  between  the  political
             group in Vietnam and the UK  and  in  dismissing  the  Facebook
             pages as 'devoid of meaningful content' when arguably they  are
             not. It is also arguable that the judge erred  in  finding  the
             appellant had little knowledge of the political party, when she
             had displayed considerable knowledge at interview.'

Decision on error of law

14. By means of a concise rule  24  response  authored  by  Ms.  Pettersen,
    Senior Presenting Officer, the respondent confirmed:

         '2.  The respondent does not oppose the appellant's application for
            permission to appeal and invites the Tribunal to  determine  the
            appeal by remitting the case to the First-Tier [Tribunal] for  a
            rehearing on all issues.'

15. Having read the decision with care, I am satisfied that the  respondent
    has adopted an entirely  appropriate  approach  to  the  error  of  law
    consideration.

16. The decision of the Judge  contains  material  errors  of  law  and  is
    therefore set aside. No findings of fact are to stand.

Remaking the decision

17. The nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary in
    order for the decision in this appeal  to  be  re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 of the 2008  Rules,
    it is appropriate  to  remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal:
    paragraph 7.2(b) of the Joint  Practice  Statement  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and Upper Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

18. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  dated  11  September  2020,
    involved the making of a material error on a point of law. I set  aside
    the Judge's decision pursuant to section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

19. No findings of fact are preserved.

20. The decision is to be remade by the First-tier Tribunal,

Anonymity Direction

21. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the  relevant  Procedure  Rules  I  confirm  the
    anonymity direction made by the First-tier Tribunal:

         'Unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no  report
         of these proceedings or  any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
         directly or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant.  This  direction
         applies to, amongst others, the appellant and the  respondent.  Any
         failure to comply with this direction could give rise  to  contempt
         of court proceedings.'
