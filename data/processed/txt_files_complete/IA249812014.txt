                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 5 November 1983.  On  23
    February 2010 he entered with leave  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant.  That leave was extended and subsequently  further  leave  was
    granted as a Tier 1 (Highly Skilled Post-Study) migrant.  In time,  the
    Appellant applied for further leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) migrant.

The Respondent's Decision

 2. On 29 May 2014 the Respondent refused the Appellant further leave as  a
    Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  migrant  under  paragraph  245DD(i)   of   the
    Immigration Rules on non-points scoring grounds.   The  Respondent  did
    not consider the Appellant genuinely intended and was able to engage in
    his proposed business or would make the requisite  investment  or  that
    the requisite funds for the investment were and would remain  available
    to him.

 3. On 12 June 2014 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal under Section  82
    of the Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act  2002  as  amended  (the
    2002 Act).  The grounds are  formulaic  and  raise  a  claim  based  on
    Article 8 of the European Convention.  Although Mr Nasim appears to  be
    instructed under the Public Access Scheme, there is no explanation with
    what authority he was able to lodge the notice of appeal on  behalf  of
    the Appellant: see the Bar Standards Board Guidance for Lay Clients  of
    March 2010.

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

 4. By a decision promulgated on 2  March  2015  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal J McIntosh dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  under  both  the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the European Convention.

 5. On 5 May 2015 Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Grimmett  refused  the
    Appellant permission to appeal. The Appellant renewed  her  application
    for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the same grounds.  On
    2 July 2015 Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Mailer  granted  permission  on
    all grounds on the basis that the Judge had arguably erred  in  failing
    to show that she had had in mind the effect of Section 85A of the  2002
    Act and  the  jurisprudence  in  Ahmed  and  Another  (PBS:  admissible
    evidence) [2014] UKUT 00365 (IAC)  and  Naved  (Student  -  fairness  -
    notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14 (IAC).

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Submissions for the Appellant

 6. Mr Nasim submitted the Respondent had  refused  the  Appellant  further
    leave on the general grounds of paragraph 245DD(h).  The Appellant  had
    been interviewed by the Respondent subsequent to  the  application  and
    the effect of Section 85A was to prevent the Appellant submitting post-
    application evidence to  address  matters  arising  out  of  the  post-
    application interview.  This was inherently unfair to the Appellant and
    he  referred  to  the  determination  in  Naved.   In  particular,   he
    identified that:-

      1) The evidence relating to the jointly held account at Barclays  Bank
         was relevant, if only because information  about  the  account  was
         relevant to the assessment of the  Appellant's  credibility.   This
         was an application which had been  refused  on  general  non-points
         scoring grounds.

      2) The record of the interview of the Appellant by the  Respondent  on
         15 May 2014 before the Tribunal was incomplete.  It appeared to  me
         that only every other page had  been  copied  and  filed  with  the
         Tribunal.

      3) Section 85A of the 2002  Act  appeared  to  make  inadmissible  the
         explanation why the Appellant had been able to save  �20,000  given
         at paragraph 8 of his statement of 12 February 2015.

 7. He drew my attention to page 9 of the Appellant's bundle filed for  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing showing that the Appellant held  in  excess
    of �50,000 in account number ***3232 in his sole name at Barclays  Bank
    plc.  This showed the  funds  were  genuinely  available  and  remained
    available to the Appellant.

 8. The application form submitted did not provide for any questions to  be
    asked or for the Appellant to establish the genuineness of himself  and
    the business to which the application related and so the Appellant  had
    had no opportunity to respond to the Respondent's  concerns  about  his
    genuineness.  The consequence was the Respondent had unfairly  and  for
    inadequate  reasons  made  adverse  findings  about   the   Appellant's
    credibility.

 9. At paragraph  28  of  her  decision  the  Judge  had  queried  how  the
    Appellant's hope to draw �1,600  monthly  from  his  new  business  was
    consistent with the fact that in the previous 24 months his expenditure
    had totalled about �4,000.   The  reply  to  question  17A  of  15  May
    interview record explained not only  how  he  had  been  able  to  save
    �20,000 but why his expenditure had been as low as  �4,000.   This  was
    before the Judge but was not referred to  in  her  decision.   Further,
    there  was  no  inconsistency  between  the  Appellant's  past   modest
    expenditure and his expressed hope for a substantially increased income
    once his new business was up and running.

10. He had represented the Appellant at the First-tier Tribunal hearing and
    the case had never been put on  the  basis  of  the  last  sentence  of
    paragraph 23 of the Judge's decision.  Indeed I note the Judge's Record
    of Proceedings does not make reference to such an argument.

Submissions for the Respondent

11. Ms Sreeraman submitted  that  although  the  Judge  had  not  expressly
    referred to Section 85A of the 2002 Act such  an  omission  was  not  a
    material error.  Paragraphs 7-12 of her decision showed she  had  taken
    into account the evidence in  the  Respondent's  bundle  and  the  oral
    evidence referred to at paragraph 7.   The  Judge  had  not  asked  any
    questions at the hearing.  Her findings at paragraph 26 on  the  source
    of the funds available to the Appellant  were  based  on  the  evidence
    before both the Respondent and the First-tier Tribunal.   At  paragraph
    27 she had  given  adequate  consideration  to  the  viability  of  the
    Appellant's business plan and reasons for her finding that it  was  not
    viable.

12. The Appellant had failed to show there had been any unfairness  in  the
    process, particularly since the Judge had considered all  the  relevant
    evidence and given at paragraphs 21-28 sustainable and adequate reasons
    for her conclusions. Mr Nasim  had  accepted  that  the  issue  of  the
    correct Immigration Rules referred to in paragraph 23 of  the  decision
    and in ground 4 of the application for permission to  appeal  were  not
    being pursued. Ms Sreeraman concluded there was no  material  error  of
    law and the appeal should be dismissed.

13. In response Mr Nasim referred to paragraph 245DD(i) of the  Immigration
    Rules which did not require the Appellant to show the provenance of the
    funding in order to prove he was genuine.  Further, interview  reply  5
    explained the funds came from the sale of land in Pakistan and this was
    supported by the documents at pages 4-7 of the Appellant's bundle which
    had been before the Judge.

Findings and Consideration

14. The Judge failed to refer to Section 85A of the 2002 Act.  The  failure
    to refer in itself would  not  amount  to  a  material  error  of  law.
    However, in her decision, the Judge failed to take  into  account  that
    the prohibition on the admissibility evidence in Section 85A(4) of  the
    2002 Act relates to new evidence.   She  did  not  clearly  distinguish
    between new evidence and the Appellant's explanation  of  the  evidence
    already submitted in support of his Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  application
    contained in 15 May 2014 interview.  Further, her consideration of  any
    explanation was vitiated by the fact that half the interview record was
    not before her.  Her treatment of the issue of the funds  in  paragraph
    26 and the finding against the Appellant that the relevant funds had to
    be in the United Kingdom was in error and also failed to  take  account
    that Table 4 of Appendix A does not require the funds  actually  be  in
    the United Kingdom: paragraph (c) of Table 4 simply  requires  they  be
    transferrable to the United Kingdom.

15. The Judge erred in her treatment of the Appellant's case  at  paragraph
    28 of her decision for the reasons mentioned above at paragraph 9.

16. The Judge failed to make a finding on the  Respondent's  conclusion  in
    the second paragraph of page 8 of the Notice of Decision about Almarjan
    Enterprises in the  light  of  the  details  extracted  from  Companies
    Registry  at  page  8  of  the  Appellant's  bundle  which  appears  to
    contradict the Respondent's conclusion.

17. I conclude that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contained
    material errors of law such that it should be set aside.  In the course
    of the hearing I had indicated to Mr Nasim that the evidence  submitted
    by way of explanation to support  the  Appellant's  evidence  submitted
    with his application was far  from  complete.   Bearing  this  in  mind
    together with Section 12(2) of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act
    2007, Practice Statement 7.2(b) and the nature and extent of the  fact-
    finding required, the matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for
    hearing afresh.

Anonymity

18. There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  heard  the
    matter I do not consider one is warranted.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law and is set  aside.   The  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for hearing afresh.

    Anonymity direction not made.
