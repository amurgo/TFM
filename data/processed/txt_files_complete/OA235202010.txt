Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Manson, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Jaffr, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nepal, who was  born  on  5th  September,
    1998.  He made application for entry clearance to  the  United  Kingdom
    for  settlement  under  paragraph  317  of  Statement  of  Changes   in
    Immigration Rules, HC 395, as amended (the "Immigration  Rules").   His
    application was refused by the Entry Clearance  Officer  on  8th  July,
    2010, and  he  appealed  that  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    Immigration and Asylum Chamber. The  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Beg, who dismissed the appellant's appeal.

Error of law

2.   On 23rd April, 2013, Upper Tribunal Judges Hanson and Coker found  that
    the First-tier Tribunal made an error of law in its  determination.   A
    copy of the determination of Upper Tribunal Judges Hanson and Coker  is
    set out and forms Appendix A to this determination.

The hearing before me

3.   I heard oral evidence  first  from  the  appellant's  mother,  Phulmaya
    Limbu, who confirmed that she is the mother of the appellant and  lives
    with her husband in Catterick. She gave  her  date  of  birth  as  30th
    November 1950, and told me that she has four daughters  and  two  sons.
    She was not sure when she came to the United  Kingdom.   The  appellant
    lives in the family home in Nepal alone.  He was refused  a  settlement
    visa because he was over the age of 18  years.   At  the  time  he  was
    living with the witness's father-in-law (the  appellant's  grandfather)
    who unfortunately died in 2010.  The  witness  told  me  that  she  has
    sisters, but she has had no contact with them for many years.  She told
    me she had no brothers.  Her husband has one brother but he has had  no
    contact with him since he was young.

4.   In answer  to  further  questions  put  to  him  by  his  Counsel,  the
    appellant's mother told me that the appellant was a  student  currently
    studying at  Dharan  College.  She  said  that  she  sends  him  money.
    Sometimes she sends him money  ever  two  weeks  sometimes  every  four
    weeks, but sometimes it can be every eight weeks. Sometimes  she  sends
    �100 and sometimes she sends �200.  Next time she sends  him  money  it
    will be �200 and she will send that next month.  Last  month  she  sent
    him �50.

5.   The witness explained that she returned to Nepal sometime  after  2009.
    She visited  in September and thought that  this  was  last  year.  She
    returned to the United Kingdom on 2nd April this year.  She  was  there
    for nine or ten months.  She went there because her son  is  living  on
    his own.  She was shown a document at page 49 in the appellant's bundle
    and confirmed that it was a statement from a  bank  account  in  Nepal.
    When she visits Nepal she takes money out of the account to give to her
    son.

6.   The witness told me that she had come to  the  hearing  today,  because
    she wanted her son to come to the United Kingdom, because she  and  her
    husband want the family to be together. Before she came to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2008, she had never lived apart from her son.  She  is  very
    sad because things are not so good back in Nepal and the family want to
    be together.  He wants to come to the United Kingdom. He  is  the  only
    member of the family who is not allowed to come to the United Kingdom.

7.   Cross-examined by the Presenting Officer, the witness  was  asked  what
    she thought the appellant meant when he said that he did not  know  why
    his father had been given indefinite leave to  remain.   The  appellant
    said that his father had never explained the matter and he  never  took
    any interest. The witness explained that she  thought  that  his  reply
    meant the family did not have the information.

8.   Her father-in-law died of old age.  She did not return for the  funeral
    because she was there at the time.   It   happened  during  her  visit.
    This was during her visit in May in 2009.  She confirmed that she never
    attended a hearing before.

9.   She agreed that she had been in Nepal between 24th May  2009  and  27th
    November 2009. She said that she had been ill during the  last  hearing
    and her husband and other family  members  attended.   The  grandfather
    died on 18th February, 2010.

10.  Referring to the death certificate appearing at page 35 of  the  bundle
    in the name of Mr Krishne Malung Hang Labung alias  Krishne  Limbu  she
    confirmed that this related to her late father-in-law.  She  was  asked
    who Mr Dev Bahadur Limbu, who is referred to as being the informant  in
    the death certificate, was. She said that it  was  her  brother-in-law.
    She then changed her evidence and told me that he was someone with  the
    same name as her brother-in-law.  He lived with her father in  law  and
    looked after him and stayed with  him.  He was an orphan who had stayed
    with her father in law to look after him.

11.  The witness was then again referred to  the  interview  conducted  with
    the appellant.  The appellant was asked whether he had any other family
    living in Nepal including grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins,  and
    the appellant said, "Grandfather lives in the village and uncle and his
    in village with his family".  The appellant said that  the  person  the
    appellant was referring to as being the uncle was a family  who  rented
    the family house and he and his wife were called  "uncle  and  auntie".
    She told me it was common in Nepal for people  to  be  referred  to  as
    uncle or auntie. She told me that this was  not  the  same  person  who
    registered the death.  She and her husband owned two   houses,  one  in
    the village and one in Dharan.  The grandfather lived in the  house  in
    the village but when he was ill he went to the house in Dharan and died
    there.

12.  She could not remember when the appellant finished studying at  school,
    but it would have been when  he  was  18  or  19,  she  said.   It  was
    suggested to her by the Presenting Officer that it was  when he was  16
    and she said that it might have been.

13.  The witness explained that her father in law's  death  certificate  was
    not provided for the first hearing but she did not know the reason why.



14.  Re-examined on behalf of the  appellant,  the  witness  confirmed  that
    according to her passport   she  returned  to  the  United  Kingdom  in
    November 2009, but she could not remember when she returned to Nepal.

15.  I then heard evidence from the appellant's father, Jangbir  Limbu,  who
    confirmed his  address  and  date  of  birth  and  confirmed  that  the
    appellant was his son. He told me that he joined the  British  Army  on
    11th October, 1966 and was discharged on 1st January but he  could  not
    now remember the exact  year.  He  was  a  member  of  the  Brigade  of
    Ghurkhas.

16.  He agreed that he had been given leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    in 2006.  He applied for his wife and two sons later because he  wanted
    his sons to finish their studies in Nepal.  He also needed to work  and
    save some money before calling them to the United Kingdom. If he  could
    have settled immediately following his discharge from the army then  he
    would have moved the family to the United  Kingdom  at  that  time  and
    would have stayed here.  The witness said that he worked for Sodex as a
    cleaner. He works full-time, for six and a half hours a day  and  earns
    approximately �843 net.

17.  His son in the United Kingdom is a student.  He works part-time and  is
    aged 22.  His daughter in the United Kingdom is 19.

18.  If his son, the appellant, enters the United Kingdom the  witness  will
    sell a home in Nepal and buy one in the United Kingdom.  He proposes to
    sell the house that his son lives in.

19.  The witness confirmed that he had sent money to his son  in  Nepal.  He
    sends roughly �200 per month and it is this that his son lives  on.  He
    has no other income.

20.  Cross-examined the witness explained that his other house in  Nepal  is
    rented out.  The rent is actually paid direct  to  the  appellant.   He
    collects it each month. Very roughly it is equivalent to  �17  sterling
    per month.

21.  The witness confirmed that he was  present at the  first   hearing  but
    he was  not  aware  that  he  needed  to  provide  his  father's  death
    certificate.  He was referred to his bank statement of 16th June,  2009
    and confirmed that he is in receipt of working tax credit.  The payment
    of �4,413 was the first payment of working tax credit that he receives.
     He receives approximately �228 per month.

22.  The appellant is currently studying.  He has not applied for  any  jobs
    in Nepal and has not applied for any jobs in the United Kingdom.

23.  In answer to questions put  by  me,  the  witness  confirmed  that  his
    brother is Dev Limbu. I asked him who Dev Bahadur Limbu  was,  and  the
    witness told me that he was his brother.

24.  I asked  him if he was the same man who  had  registered  his  father's
    death and he told me that the man who registered his father's death was
    a man who was treated by the appellant's father as a son and who looked
    after his father.  He had taken  the  same  names  as  the  appellant's
    brother.  He  now  lives  somewhere  else.  He  moved  away  after  the
    witness's father died. The witness told  me  he  had  no  relatives  in
    Nepal.

25.  In answer to questions put to him by his Counsel, the witness  told  me
    that he did not know what had happened to  his  brother.  He  moved  to
    India and he and his brother lost contact  with  each  other.   In  his
    submissions the Presenting Officer relied on the reasons  for  refusal.
    He submitted that it was necessary for the appellant to prove that  his
    parents were in the United Kingdom and that he is living alone  outside
    the United Kingdom and is dependent on them.  This appeal raised issues
    of credibility.   There  is  the  question  of  the  existence  of  the
    grandfather and now, it seems the existence of an uncle.

26.  The appellant's mother claims that she was present at the death of  the
    grandfather but there is nothing in her statement or in the copy of her
    passport to show that she was actually in Nepal at the time her  father
    in law died. The grandfather's death certificate  was  not  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge. As to Article 8, he asked me  to  note  that
    there had been a delay in making the application.   The  appellant  was
    apparently employed at the time of the application.  For the respondent
    Counsel suggested that there was family life and the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer is disproportionate.  He asked me  to  consider
    paragraph 46 of Gurung. He referred me to paragraphs 23, 37, 41, 43 and
    45 of Pun, Pun and Gurung (Ghurkhas policy - Article  8)  Nepal  [2010]
    00377.

27.  He suggested that the appellant's family members have  been  consistent
    about the transfer of money and although it may appear to be small,  it
    has to be borne in mind that he lives in the family issue and therefore
    only needs to pay for food and for his study.  The  appellant's  father
    was granted leave in 2006.  By  the  time  he  was  granted  leave  the
    appellant was already 18 years of age.  He  invited  me  to  allow  the
    appeal.

Consideration

28.  Both representatives appeared to  be  under  the  impression  that  the
    appellant still had a current paragraph 317 immigration appeal.  It was
    clear to me, however, having read Appendix A, that it was the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal in respect of human rights grounds, that was
    set aside, not the decision under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  only
    appeal before me, therefore, is the appellant's Article 8 human  rights
    appeal.

Article 8

29.  Article 8 of the  European  Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Human
    Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides for  respect  for  a  person's
    private and family life, their home and correspondence.  The  appellant
    has to show that the subject matter of the Article 8 subsists and  that
    the decision of the respondent will interfere with it.  If he does  so,
    it is for the respondent to show that the  decision  is  in  accordance
    with the law, that it is one of the  legitimate  purposes  set  out  in
    Article 8(2) in this case for the economic well-being of  the  country,
    for the prevention of disorder or crime and for the protection  of  the
    rights and freedoms of others, and that it is necessary in a democratic
    society, which means that it must be proportionate.

36.  At paragraph 17 of Razgar v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2004] UKHL 27, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said this:
         "17.  In considering whether  a  challenge  to  the  Secretary  of
             State's decision to remove a person  must  clearly  fail,  the
             reviewing court must, as it  seems  to  me,  consider  how  an
             appeal would be likely to fare before an adjudicator,  as  the
             tribunal responsible for deciding the appeal if there were  an
             appeal. This means that the reviewing court  must  ask  itself
             essentially the questions which would have to be  answered  by
             an adjudicator.  In  a  case  where  removal  is  resisted  in
             reliance on article 8, these questions are likely to be:
             (1)      Will the proposed removal be  an  interference  by  a
                  public authority with the  exercise  of  the  applicant's
                  right to respect for his private or (as the case may  be)
                  family life?
             (2)      If so, will such interference  have  consequences  of
                  such gravity as potentially to engage  the  operation  of
                  article 8?
             (3)      If so, is such interference in  accordance  with  the
                  law?
             (4)      If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic
                  society in the interests  of  national  security,  public
                  safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the
                  prevention of disorder or crime, for  the  protection  of
                  health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and
                  freedoms of others?
             (5)      If so, is such interference proportionate to the
                  legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"
29.  At the commencement of the hearing Mr Manson  quite  properly  conceded
    that, at the time of the  application,  there  clearly  was  Article  8
    family life between the appellant and his family members in the  United
    Kingdom.  The application was  decided  on  8th  July  2010,  when  the
    appellant was already 19 years of age.  It appears that at the time  of
    the application, the appellant's mother was living with  him,  but  she
    was not living with him permanently; she had  already  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The only thing that has changed since the date of  the
    application is that the appellant's grandfather has, apparently,  died.
    He is clearly still being supported financially by his parents and  his
    mother has made trips to Nepal to be with him and to see him.   In  the
    context of this appeal I am prepared to accept the family is very close
    and that family life exists between them.

30.  I am prepared to accept,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities,  that  the
    appellant's grandfather has died and that the informant who  registered
    his death was an orphan who had  been  befriended  by  the  appellant's
    grandfather and who had looked the appellant's grandfather in his later
    life. I am also prepared to accept that the appellant's uncle  left  to
    go to India after having failed to join his brother in the British Army
    and that the appellant's uncle and the appellant's father have not  had
    any contact with each other for many years.  I am  prepared  to  accept
    that the appellant's mother has no family members in Nepal that she  is
    in contact with.  Given the close nature of the family  relationship  I
    believe that the appellant, notwithstanding  his  age,  almost  totally
    dependent upon his parents not only for his finances and  accommodation
    but for his welfare and support generally.

31.  Having found that family life exists  between  the  appellant  and  his
    family members I now have to consider the other questions posed by Lord
    Bingham.


         "1.  Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  appellant's  right  to
             respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?

         2.   If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?


         3.   If so, is such an interference in accordance with the law?


         4.   If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of  the  country  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or  morals  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?


         5.   If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             end sought to be achieved."

32.  I believe  that  such  interference  does  have  consequences  of  such
    gravity as potentially to  engage  the  operation  of  Article  8;  the
    threshold for which is not especially high (see  paragraph  28  of  the
    judgement of Sedley LJ in AG (Eritrea) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home  Department  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  801).   The  interference  is   in
    accordance with the law and is necessary in a  democratic  society  for
    the economic well-being of the country for the prevention  of  disorder
    or crime and for the protection of the rights and freedoms  of  others;
    the question is whether or not interference is proportionate.

33.  At the time the appellant's father was granted  leave  to  remain,  the
    appellant was 18 years of age.  The appellant's father had, of  course,
    retired from the Ghurkha regiment several years earlier and he told me,
    and I accept, that had he been allowed to settle in the United  Kingdom
    with his family on retirement then he would have done so.

34.  The historic injustice done to former members of the  Ghurkha  regiment
    is of course only one of the factors to  be  taken  into  account  when
    considering the need to maintain a firm and  fair  immigration  policy.
    Nonetheless I do take it into account in this appeal.  I bear  in  mind
    also that the appellant is living in Nepal on his own and that he is  a
    student.  If he comes to the United Kingdom I have no doubt at all that
    he will wish to continue his studies.  His younger brother  and  sister
    are in the United Kingdom and he is the only member  of  the  immediate
    family remaining in Nepal.

35.  I have concluded that in the particular circumstances of  this  appeal,
    the respondent's decision is disproportionate.

36.  I allow the appellant's Article 8 appeal.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Jafar, counsel, instructed by Ghurkha
International Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr M Johnson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                         ERROR OF LAW AND DIRECTIONS

     1. The appellant appeals a decision of First tier Tribunal  Judge  Beg
        dated 29th July 2011 who dismissed  an  appeal  by  him  under  the
        Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds  against  a  decision
        made on 13th August 2010 to refuse to grant him entry clearance  as
        the adult dependant of his father. An extension of time was granted
        and permission to appeal was granted on 29th February 2012.


      Background


     2. The appellant, a citizen of Nepal date of birth 15 September  1999,
        applied for entry clearance on 12th August 2008 to join his father,
        a former Ghurkha soldier who had been granted indefinite  leave  to
        remain in the UK in 2006. He submitted an application at  the  same
        time as his mother and two younger siblings. His mother was granted
        indefinite leave to enter the UK on  1st  April  2008  as  was  his
        younger brother. His younger sister  was  granted  entry  clearance
        valid from 3rd December  2009.   His  mother  and  younger  brother
        travelled to the UK, utilising the entry clearance  for  the  first
        time on 23rd November 2008. His younger sister travelled to the  UK
        utilising her visa on 2nd April 2010. The  appellant's  application
        was refused. He renewed the application on 1st July 2009 and it was
        again  refused  by  decision  dated  8th  July  2010,  following  a
        telephone interview with the ECO  on  29th  June  2010,  but  which
        appears not to  have  been  served  until  13th  August  2010.  The
        decision was reviewed  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  on  30th
        November 2011.


     3. The appellant's mother, according to the copy  endorsement  in  her
        passport, returned to Nepal on 24th May  2009  where  she  remained
        until coming back to the UK on 23rd November  2009  where  she  has
        remained.

     4. The appellant, who was and is a student, lived with his mother  and
        sibling(s) in the family home  until  they  left  for  the  UK.  He
        remained living there. He has  not  formed  an  independent  family
        unit.

     5.  Judge  Beg,  after  hearing  oral  evidence  and  considering  the
        documentary evidence before her found:

        a. the appellant did not  meet  the  criteria  in  the  Immigration
           Rules, in particular that he was living alone outside the UK  in
           the most  exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  and  mainly
           dependant financially on relatives in the UK [9];
        b. The appellant's father had been sending money to  the  appellant
           in 2009 but that he had not been  sending  money  on  a  regular
           basis [9].
        c. The appellant's father continues to send him funds from  the  UK
           [16].
        d. The appellant has other relatives in Nepal [13].
        e. The appellant lives in a house owned by his father and there  is
           land [17].
        f. The appellant is a student; he is not suffering from any illness
           or disability [13].
        g. The relationship between the appellant and his father and  other
           relatives in the UK does not constitute family life  within  the
           purpose and meaning of Article 8 [16].
        h. The relationship between the appellant and his relatives in  the
           UK is an element  of  his  private  life;  he  can  continue  to
           maintain contact with them by telephone and they can  visit  him
           [17].
        i. He has a comfortable standard of living in Nepal [17].
        j. The  refusal  of  entry  clearance  is  not  a  disproportionate
           interference with his private life [17].


          Error of law


     6. The grounds of appeal take issue with the failure of the First-tier
        Tribunal judge to accept  and  acknowledge  that  the  relationship
        between the appellant and his mother and father amounts  to  family
        life within the meaning and purpose of Article 8. Mr Jafar drew our
        particular attention to Ghising [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC) and  Gurung
        [2013] EWCA Civ 8. He referred to what he submitted to be a failure
        to have proper regard to the factual  situation  before  her,  that
        some of the matters that she considered to be inconsistencies  were
        irrelevant to the decision whether there was family life  and  that
        there were significant unresolved contradictions in her findings.


     7. Mr Johnson submitted that the findings were clear and  unambiguous,
        that there was no perversity in  the  judge's  decision  which  was
        based on sustainable findings.


     8. There appear to be some errors of interpretation in the evidence as
        related by Judge Beg:

        a. She refers to the appellant stating  in  a  telephone  interview
           that his grandfather was living in the  village.  Whilst  it  is
           correct that he said this  in  a  telephone  interview,  it  was
           during an interview conducted in  connection  with  the  earlier
           application for entry clearance in 2009 and the grandfather died
           in February 2010. Judge Beg states that there  was  no  evidence
           that the grandfather had died whereas there was a  copy  of  the
           death  certificate  in  the  papers  before  her  and  she  drew
           attention to these matters as a discrepancy, which in fact  they
           were not.
        b. The appellant's mother was living in Nepal  with  the  appellant
           until 23rd November 2008 and then again from 24th May 2009 until
           23rd November 2009. This does not appear to have formed part  of
           the consideration by the judge who appears  to  have  considered
           the appeal on the basis that the mother had only returned for  a
           visit to Nepal - see [17].
        c. There are 6 money transfers between the date of the  appellant's
           mother returning to the UK in November  2009  and  the  date  of
           decision. Since the date of  decision  there  were  other  money
           transfers and evidence of withdrawals from the father's Nepalese
           bank account. The judge disregarded these because they were post
           decision evidence and, although referring to case law authority,
           may have misinterpreted that authority which of  course  enables
           post decision evidence to be considered where it  appertains  to
           the matter  in  issue.  In  this  appeal,  the  funding  of  the
           appellant is in issue and it would have been appropriate for the
           evidence  of  post  decision  funds  provision  to   have   been
           considered.
        d.  The  judge  does  not  appear  to  have   factored   into   her
           consideration the fact that  the  mother  was  living  with  the
           appellant until November 2009 and this may well have  influenced
           how and to whom money was sent by the father.
        e. The judge appears to  have  proceeded  on  the  basis  that  the
           appellant's grandfather was in Nepal whereas he had died  before
           the decision.
        f. In reaching her decision that there was no  family  life  within
           the meaning and purpose of Article 8 the judge proceeded on  the
           basis that the mother came to the UK in 2008 and  only  returned
           to Nepal once for a visit, whereas  she  actually  returned  for
           some 6 months. She has also not considered the fact that by that
           time the two younger siblings were in the UK pursuing  education
           and also required her care, thus being a  split  family.  Whilst
           accepting that funds were sent to  the  appellant  she  has  not
           factored into her decision that the appellant is a  student  and
           fully financially dependant upon his father given  studies,  his
           living arrangements and lack of employment.
        g. The judge fails to consider that separation does not necessarily
           mean that family life  ceases  to  exist  and  that  it  is  the
           circumstances of that separation that have to be considered.
        h. In her assessment of whether family life exists for the  purpose
           and meaning of Article 8 the judge  refers  to  Kugathas  [2003]
           EWCA Civ 31. Although this is correct, the nuances  of  such  an
           assessment were further explored in Ghising and Gurung to  which
           she has not referred. She made no reasoned reference or  finding
           with regard to the emotional ties and links the appellant may or
           may not have with his parents.

     9. We are satisfied that there  is  a  contradiction  in  the  judge's
        findings as to the financial dependency of the  appellant.  We  are
        satisfied  that  this  contradiction  renders  the  finding  as  to
        dependency unsafe, based as it is on a lack of finding as  to  what
        other  source  of  finance  the  appellant  may  have  had.  Whilst
        financial dependency does not of itself mean that  family  life  is
        engaged for the purposes of Article 8, it is a  significant  factor
        which has infected the overall decision of the judge to  find  that
        the relationship between the appellant and his family only  impacts
        on his private life. This is further confirmed by the seeming  lack
        of awareness of the judge that the appellant's grandfather had died
        and that his mother remained in Nepal for  such  a  lengthy  period
        after she  had  been  granted  entry  clearance  and  the  lack  of
        consideration  as  to  the  emotional  context  of   the   familial
        relationship.


    10. Taking all of these matters into account we are satisfied that  the
        lack of full awareness of the factual situation  of  the  appellant
        and the contradictory findings amount to an error  of  law  in  the
        findings of the judge that the appellant did not have  family  life
        such as to engage Article 8. We are satisfied that the error of law
        is such that the decision on human rights grounds is set  aside  to
        be remade.

      Conclusion

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     We set aside the decision on human rights grounds to be remade



      Directions

   1. To be listed for determination of the human rights grounds of  appeal,
      none of the findings of fact reached by Judge Beg to stand.
