Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss R Harrington, Counsel, instructed by Qualified
                    Legal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Yemen, appealed against  the  Respondent's
    decision, dated 30 April 2014, to refuse entry clearance with reference
    to paragraphs E-ECP.1.1, E-ECP.2.6  and  2.10  and  with  reference  to
    Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules HC 395 as amended.

2.   Two principal issues arose in the  appeal  before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge O'Brien whose decision [D], dated 18  August  2015,  led  to  the
    appeal being dismissed under the Immigration Rules and on human  rights
    grounds.  Permission to appeal was given by Upper Tribunal Judge Martin
    sitting as a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal on 25 January 2016.   The
    Respondent  served  a  Rule  24  response,  dated  1   February   2016,
    essentially arguing no error by the judge.

3.   The judge did resolve the issue of whether  there  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting  relationship and concluded at D30 that  the  Appellant  and
    Miss Ali were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  The  judge  on
    the information before him concluded that  the  financial  requirements
    had not been met because the amount of income as calculated  was  under
    the required figure of �18,600 gross in the twelve month period   prior
    to the application.

4.   Miss Harrington today spotted the  fact  that  there  was  an  apparent
    error by  the  Respondent  in  the  selection  of  the  wrong  date  of
    application: Although it had been taken to  be  2  March  in  fact  the
    application was made, the fee having been paid, on 20 March 2014:  from
    the documents before the judge and before me, it is possible in fact to
    calculate as she did, in helpful tabular form, the correct  figure  for
    the gross earnings in the relevant twelve month period which as I  have
    indicated, the judge  was  unaware  of.  It  is  extremely  unfortunate
    because had the right application date been taken it demonstrated  that
    the earnings met the threshold and amounted to some �19,248  odd  gross
    in the required period and thus he met the �18,600 figure  required  in
    the same twelve months period.

5.   Thus it is clear that paragraph 13A and 18E applied under  Appendix  FM
    and therefore there was no failure on the maintenance ground.

6.   In those circumstances it is accepted on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State that there was an error of fact amounting to  an  error  of  law,
    even though the judge was not aware of it and that in the circumstances
    it is open to me to find that the Original Tribunal's  decision  cannot
    stand: I do so.

7.   It was also a matter of submissions, but agreed by  the  parties,  that
    it is open to me on this limited issue relating to maintenance alone to
    remake the decision.  For the reasons given above I am  satisfied  that
    the Appellant has discharged the burden of  proof  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities of showing that at the relevant date, being the  date  of
    application, as well as obviously the date of  hearing,  the  Appellant
    met the required maintenance requirements under the Rules.

8.   The following decision is substituted.  The appeal is allowed.

Anonymity Order

9.   No anonymity order having  been  made  nothing  indicates  that  it  is
    necessary or appropriate for one to be imposed.

Fee Award

10.  No fee having been paid I do not find it  appropriate  to  make  a  fee
    award against the Secretary of State.

Signed                                  Date 28 July 2016

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey
