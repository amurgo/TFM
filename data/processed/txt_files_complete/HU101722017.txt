Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. N. Ahmed, Counsel instructed by Peer & Co.
For the Respondent:    Mr. D. Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By way of a decision promulgated on  17  May  2019,  I  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The appeal came before me  to  be
    remade.


 2. The Appellant and Sponsor attended the hearing.


 3. At the outset of the hearing I heard  submissions  from  Mr.  Mills  in
    which he asked that the appeal be allowed.  Mr. Mill's reasons for this
    are as follows.

 4. With reference to the reasons for refusal letter, he submitted that the
    Appellant's application should have  remained  within  part  8  of  the
    immigration rules as the application had been made under paragraph 284.
     The Appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2010.  Twice  since
    her arrival she had extended her leave under paragraph 284.  In 2017  a
    further application was made under paragraph 284.

 5. With reference to paragraph 284(4), Mr. Mills accepted  that  paragraph
    39E of the immigration rules applied.  The Appellant's application  had
    been made eight days out of time.  This was within  the  fourteen  days
    provided for under paragraph 39E.  Paragraph 39E also required that  an
    explanation should be given as to why the application was not  made  in
    time.  Mr. Mills referred to D1 of the Respondent's  bundle  where  the
    Appellant had provided an explanation.  This states:

         "This application is late due to a couple of reasons.  The main one
         being that 28  days  ago  we  were  unable  to  pay  for  both  the
         application and the health surcharge.  This was compounded  when  a
         new FLR(M) application form came out and we had to start  again  to
         fill it out with an increased application cost."

 6. Mr. Mills accepted that this was a reasonable  explanation.   The  fees
    had gone up and a new surcharge had been implemented.  He  referred  to
    the reasons for refusal letter  which  considered  the  fact  that  the
    application had been made out of time on page 2.   However,  while  the
    letter states that the application was "raised 8  days  out  of  time",
    there is no consideration of the explanation given  by  the  Appellant.
    Mr. Mills accepted that  the  Respondent  should  have  considered  the
    explanation given for the late submission of the application.

 7. Mr. Mills referred to [22] and [23] of the decision of Judge Obi  where
    it is clear that she was aware of this issue.   However,  he  submitted
    that the Judge had not come to a decision as to whether or not this was
    a good explanation.  At [23] she states:

         "If that explanation was provided to the respondent at the time  of
         the application, it is possible that it would  have  been  a  "good
         reason", when viewed objectively."

 8. The Judge did not acknowledge that the explanation  had  been  provided
    with the application.  Neither did she make a decision as to whether it
    was a good reason, but instead proceeded to consider  the  appeal  with
    reference to Appendix FM.  Mr. Mills  submitted  that  what  the  Judge
    should have done was consider whether or not the explanation was a good
    one.  Having accepted the explanation for the delay,  which  Mr.  Mills
    conceded was a good reason, he submitted that  the  Judge  should  have
    proceeded to consider the Appellant's application under paragraph  284.



 9. Paragraph 284 requires that the Appellant show "adequate  maintenance".
    Mr. Mills accepted that, at the time of the application,  the  evidence
    showed that there was adequate  maintenance.   He  submitted  that  the
    Judge should have accepted the explanation, stated that  paragraph  39E
    applied, and considered  the  application  under  paragraph  284.   The
    evidence provided was  sufficient  to  show  that  there  was  adequate
    maintenance.  Therefore the Judge should have allowed the appeal.

10. Mr. Mills further accepted that, at the date of the hearing before  me,
    there was evidence to show that the more onerous financial requirements
    of Appendix FM were met.  However, as the application  was  made  under
    paragraph 284, it should have been considered under  paragraph  284  on
    the basis of "adequate maintenance".

11. Mr. Mills asked that I allow the appeal on the basis that the Appellant
    had shown that she  met  the  requirements  of  paragraph  284  of  the
    immigration rules.

12. I thanked Mr. Mills for his approach.  I stated that I would allow  the
    appeal for the reasons given by him.

13. The Respondent has accepted that the Appellant meets  the  requirements
    of paragraph 284 of the immigration rules.  She has a family life  with
    the Sponsor, her husband.   This  being  the  case,  I  find  that  the
    decision is a breach of the Appellant's right to a  family  life  under
    Article 8 ECHR in accordance with the case of TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA
    Civ 1109, and OA and Others (human rights; 'new matter'; s.120) Nigeria
    [2019] UKUT 00065 (IAC).  The headnote to OA states:

         "(1) In a  human  rights  appeal  under  section  82(1)(b)  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  a  finding  that  a
         person (P) satisfies the requirements of a  particular  immigration
         rule, so as to be entitled to leave to remain, means that (provided
         Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged), the Secretary of State will  not
         be able to point  to  the  importance  of  maintaining  immigration
         controls as a factor weighing in favour of the Secretary  of  State
         in the proportionality balance, so far as that  factor  relates  to
         the particular immigration rule that the  judge  has  found  to  be
         satisfied."

Notice of Decision

14. The Appellant's appeal is allowed on human rights grounds,  Article  8.
    As was accepted by the Respondent before me, the  Appellant  meets  the
    requirements of paragraph 284 of the immigration rules.


15. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award.  I have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of ï¿½140 for the following reason.  The Respondent failed  to  consider
the explanation given by the Appellant for why  her  application  was  late.
Had the Respondent given proper consideration to this, she should then  have
accepted the explanation, as was conceded by Mr.  Mills,  and  proceeded  to
consider the Appellant's application under  paragraph  284.   The  Appellant
had provided evidence with her application to show that  she  satisfied  the
requirements of this paragraph.


Signed                                  Date 12 September 2019
