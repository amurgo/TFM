Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Bates (sponsor)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 26 July 2013, Ms Nguyen, who was born on 18 April 1985 and who is  a
    citizen of Vietnam, applied for entry clearance to join her partner, Mr
    Roy Bates, a British citizen living in the UK.  On 28 October 2013 that
    application was refused.

Error on a point of law

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) refused that  application  under  the
    partner route of appendix FM to the immigration rules  because  he  was
    not satisfied Ms Nguyen met the financial requirements.  When Ms Nguyen
    appealed that  immigration  decision  she  submitted  evidence  of  her
    sponsor's financial circumstances and an Entry Clearance Manager  (ECM)
    conceded that those requirements were  in  fact  met  at  the  date  of
    decision.  However, the ECM identified that she had not shown  how  she
    met the provisions of GEN.1.2 of appendix FM and therefore the decision
    to refuse was maintained.

 3. In his determination,  promulgated  on  2  September  2014,  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Newberry allowed the appeal because he was satisfied the
    relationship between the  Ms  Nguyen  and  Mr  Bates  was  genuine  and
    subsisting.  However, although at paragraph 7 of his  determination  he
    referred to the paragraph GEN.1.2, Judge  Newberry  did  not  make  any
    finding as to how Ms Nguyen met any of its provisions.  It is for  this
    reason the ECO appeals to the Upper Tribunal,  saying  it  contains  an
    error on a point of law and requesting the decision is  set  aside  and
    remade to dismiss the appeal against the  immigration  decision  of  28
    October 2013.

 4. Having considered the grounds of appeal and after hearing from both  Mr
    Mills and Mr Bates, I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination contains an  error  on  a  point  of  law  because  Judge
    Newberry failed to  make  a  finding  as  to  how  Ms  Nguyen  met  the
    provisions of paragraph GEN.1.2 of appendix FM.   Furthermore,  I  find
    that this failure is material to the outcome because  if  she  did  not
    meet any of the provisions of GEN.1.2 then she could not  benefit  from
    the partner route of appendix FM.

 5. For these reasons, therefore, I find that the  determination  not  only
    contains a legal error but that error is such that the decision must be
    set aside and remade.

Remaking the decision

 6. The issue is whether Ms Nguyen can meet  any  of  the  requirements  of
    paragraph GEN.1.2.  At the date of decision, the provisions of  GEN.1.2
    were:

        Definitions

        GEN.1.2. For the purposes of this Appendix "partner" means -

           (i) the applicant's spouse;

           (ii) the applicant's civil partner;

           (iii) the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner; or

           (iv) a person who has been living together with the applicant in
           a relationship akin to a marriage or civil  partnership  for  at
           least two years prior to the date of application,

        unless the context otherwise requires

 7. I take each provision in turn.

Spouse

 8. Ms Nguyen is not married to the sponsor and  therefore  cannot  benefit
    from the first provision.

Civil partner

 9. Nor is Ms Nguyen in a civil partnership and  therefore  cannot  benefit
    from the second provision.

Fianc�e

10. Mr Bates told me at the hearing  that  he  proposed  to  Ms  Nguyen  in
    February 2013 and therefore  at  the  date  of  decision  she  was  his
    fianc�e.  However, neither he  nor  Ms  Nguyen  wanted  to  plan  their
    wedding before Ms Nguyen had a chance to decide if she wanted  to  live
    in the UK.  At the date of decision, although the  couple  intended  to
    marry at some time in the future, they did not know whether they  would
    marry in the UK.

11. Mr Bates also advised me that the couple did not want to be  forced  to
    marry within six months of Ms Nguyen  being  granted  entry  clearance.
    They both felt this would put undue pressure on them and neither wanted
    to feel they were being  forced  to  marry  to  sort  out  Ms  Nguyen's
    immigration status.  Mr Bates did not think they would have been  in  a
    position to arrange their marriage within six months in any event.

12. Mr Mills did not dispute anything Mr Bates told  me.   I  am  satisfied
    that Mr Bates has been honest about his relationship with Ms Nguyen and
    their intentions regarding marriage.  The question, however, is whether
    Ms Nguyen could be regarded as a fianc�e for the purposes  of  appendix
    FM to the immigration rules.

13. I have had regard to the provisions of the partner route and  am  aware
    that paragraph E-ECP.2.8 contains the following requirement:

        E-ECP.2.8. If the  applicant  is  a  fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil
        partner they must be seeking  entry  to  the  UK  to  enable  their
        marriage or civil partnership to take place.

14. I have also considered to paragraph D-ECP:

        Decisions on application for entry clearance as a partner

        D-ECP.1.1. If  the  applicant  meets  the  requirements  for  entry
        clearance  as  a  partner  the  applicant  will  be  granted  entry
        clearance for an  initial  period  not  exceeding  33  months,  and
        subject to a condition of no recourse to public  funds;  or,  where
        the applicant  is  a  fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil  partner,  the
        applicant  will  be  granted  entry  clearance  for  a  period  not
        exceeding 6 months, and subject to a condition of  no  recourse  to
        public funds and a prohibition on employment.

15. The provisions of these two paragraphs assist me in deciding whether Ms
    Nguyen could be a  fianc�e  for  the  purposes  of  appendix  FM.   The
    evidence is that Ms Nguyen was not seeking to enter the  UK  to  enable
    her marriage to take place or that she intended  to  marry  within  six
    months of entry clearance being granted.  This does not mean I  do  not
    accept that Mr Bates and Ms Nguyen are engaged.  It simply  means  that
    Ms Nguyen cannot be regarded as a fianc�e for the purposes of  appendix
    FM.

Unmarried partner

16. I am aware  that  in  her  application  form  Ms  Nguyen  answered  the
    question, "61. On what basis are you going to the UK?" by  stating  "As
    the unmarried or same sex partner of someone settled or going to settle
    in the UK."

17. It is clear that Ms Nguyen could not  meet  the  criteria  set  out  in
    GEN.1.2(iv) because at the date of application Ms Nguyen and  Mr  Bates
    had known each other for less than 12 months and had  spent  only  nine
    days or so together.  Little had changed by the date of decision  which
    is the date at which I have to consider whether the requirements of the
    immigration rules were met.  It is evident  from  the  facts  that  the
    requirements of GEN.1.2(iv) were not met.

18. For the sake of clarity, nothing I have said should be taken to suggest
    that the relationship between Ms Nguyen and Mr Bates  is  anything  but
    genuine and subsisting.  That finding was made by Judge Newberry and is
    not challenged  so  is  preserved.   It  is  unsurprising  that  it  is
    unchallenged given the vast evidence of continued contact  between  the
    couple.  However, that finding is not enough  to  satisfy  any  of  the
    provisions of GEN.1.2.

19. As Ms Nguyen has not shown that she met the  requirements  of  GEN.1.2,
    the appeal on the grounds that the  immigration  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the immigration rules must fail.

Human rights

20. Before concluding this decision I bear in mind that Ms  Nguyen  has  no
    legal representative and I cannot expect Mr Bates to have knowledge  of
    the complexities of immigration law or of any rights under Article 8 of
    the human rights  convention.   Because  the  relationship  between  Ms
    Nguyen and Mr Bates is not disputed, I have  considered  their  private
    and family life rights of my own volition.

21. I remind myself that the relevant date remains the date of decision and
    that if Ms Nguyen can show that it was more likely than  not  that  she
    had established family life with Mr Bates at that date, then it was for
    the ECO to show that it was more likely than not that his decision  was
    proportionate.  To consider their rights I have regard to the  step  by
    step approach suggested by the House of Lords in Razgar.

22. As I have indicated, there is no dispute  that  the  couple  are  in  a
    genuine relationship or that the  immigration  decision  prevents  them
    living together in the UK.  For  these  reasons  I  am  satisfied  that
    Article 8(1) is engaged.

23. The evidence shows that the couple have been  able  to  maintain  their
    relationship  at   a   distance   without   any   significant   adverse
    consequences.  There is nothing to indicate that they could  not  marry
    overseas or plan to marry in the UK in accordance with the requirements
    of the immigration rules.  Their desire not to do so  is  a  matter  of
    choices they have made.

24. It is in the public interest  that  effective  immigration  control  is
    maintained and that includes an expectation that a person  will  comply
    with the immigration rules.  This is not only set out in s.117B of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) but has  also
    been confirmed by the Grand Chamber of  the  European  Court  of  Human
    Rights in its judgment, Jeunesse v the Netherlands (appl no 12738/10, 3
    Oct 2014).

25. The evidence indicates that the ECO's decision is compatible  with  the
    provisions of Article 8 of the human rights convention because there is
    no compelling circumstance that would suggest departure from the  usual
    provisions of immigration control.

26. Having considered all relevant factors, I am satisfied that the  appeal
    could not succeed on the grounds that the immigration decision was  not
    compatible with the human rights convention.

Conclusion

27. As Ms Nguyen does not  succeed  on  any  grounds,  I  must  remake  the
    decision in relation to the initial  appeal,  to  say  that  appeal  is
    dismissed.  In other words, Ms Nguyen's original appeal fails.



Decision

The Entry Clearance Officer's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed
because the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Newberry contains  an
error on a point of law and is set aside.

I  remake  the  decision  and  dismiss  Ms  Nguyen's  appeal   against   the
immigration decision of 28 October 2013 refusing her entry  clearance  under
the partner route of appendix FM to the immigration rules.
