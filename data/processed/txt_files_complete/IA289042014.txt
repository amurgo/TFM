For the Respondent:    Mr Ali a Legal Representative


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Secretary of State notified Mrs Akmal on 15 July  2014  of  her
         decision to refuse to grant leave to remain and  requiring  her  to
         leave. Mrs Akmal's appeal against  that  decision  was  allowed  by
         First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade ("the Judge") following a  hearing
         on 30 January 2015. This is an appeal against that decision.

      2. Designated Judge Macdonald granted permission to appeal on 13 April
         2015 as;

             "... it is  unclear  why  the  Tribunal  was  referring  to  a
             verification report and  the  judge  does  not  say  that  the
             original language certificate was produced".

      3. Mr Mills conceded that the original  English  language  certificate
         was on his file and he had no reason to doubt it had been  produced
         at the hearing. Accordingly he did not wish to pursue the appeal.

      4. I am satisfied, given the concession, that  the  Judge  would  have
         said he had not seen the English language certificate if  that  was
         the case. Accordingly I am satisfied that it was in  fact  produced
         and the Judge was entitled to be satisfied that all aspects of  the
         relevant rule had been satisfied.

Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set aside the decision.
