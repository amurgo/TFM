Representation:
For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal previously came before me on 20  August  2018  when  I  set
    aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana promulgated on 24
    May 2018, allowing Mr Nysztal's appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State made on 2 March 2018 to  make  a  deportation  order
    against him pursuant to the Immigration Act 1971  and  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

 2. As noted in my decision made on that date (a copy of which is  annexed)
    it was not possible to remake the decision on that date as although the
    nature of Mr Nysztal's criminal activity  in  the  United  Kingdom  was
    clear, there were difficulties about the nature and  sentences  imposed
    for his offending in Poland.  For that reason, I made  a  direction  on
    that occasion for the appellant to  obtain  evidence  from  the  Polish
    authorities confirming the criminal sentences he received in  Walbrzych
    on 20 February 2013.  There has been no response to that direction.

 3. When the matter came before me at 10 a.m., there was no  appearance  by
    the appellant nor any explanation for this.  I am  satisfied  from  the
    court file that due notice of the time, date and venue for  the  appeal
    had been served on the appellant but no explanation for his failure  to
    attend was provided.  In light of the history  of  this  case  and  the
    overriding objective, I was satisfied that it would be appropriate  for
    me to proceed to determine the appeal in the appellant's absence.

 4. I heard brief submissions from  Ms  Holmes  which  I  have  taken  into
    account in reaching my decision.

The Law

 5. The starting point in  considering  an  appeal  against  a  deportation
    decision under the EEA Regulations is Regulation 27(5)  which  provides
    as follows:

         "(5) The public policy and  public  security  requirements  of  the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-


             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
                  proportionality;


             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;


             (c)  the personal conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;


             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;


             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;


             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
                  in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided
                  the grounds are specific to the person."


 6. In considering this issue I  must  also  have  regard  (see  Regulation
    27(8)) to the considerations set out in Schedule 1 of the  Regulations.



 7. The circumstances, and indeed the  sentences  imposed  for  the  crimes
    committed in Poland, are  unclear.   The  appellant  did  on  the  last
    occasion explain that they had been thefts from shops after breaking in
    - what would, under English law, be burglaries of commercial premises.

 8. As Ms Holmes accepted, there is an  inconsistency  in  the  PNC  record
    which is the sole evidence showing that immediate  custodial  sentences
    were passed on the appellant.  On his account, he was  responsible  for
    burglaries.  Irrespective of whether the sentences was suspended or not
    these were clearly crimes of sufficient seriousness to deserve (even if
    not immediately imposed) custodial sentences.

 9. The appellant does not appear to have learnt  from  his  experience  in
    Poland as can be seen by the circumstances in which, as he said, at the
    error of law hearing, and it appears before Judge Chana,  that  he  had
    stolen a mobile phone because he entered into a warehouse, found nobody
    there and simply took the phone.  He was it appears tracked down  in  a
    short time after that as its owner had used tracking  software  and  he
    was apprehended by the police.

10. The appellant is an inept criminal and displays a significant  lack  of
    thinking skills. Taking into account the evidence  given  before  Judge
    Chana in the First-tier Tribunal and viewing the evidence as a whole  I
    conclude that there is no indication that he would  not  offend  again.
    Whilst the offending is clearly at a low level, it  is  nonetheless  an
    offence of theft and there is no prospect that this will  not  reoccur,
    nor is there any real evidence that the appellant has changes his ways.
    Further, he was also convicted of unlawful possession  of  a  knife.  I
    have only his word that he had it in his bag as it was a knife used for
    cutting carpet and was a tool of his trade.

11. Whilst he is not a persistent offender his personal conduct is such  as
    to cause me to conclude that he does present a genuine and sufficiently
    serious threat to the public interest in that his offending, whilst  at
    a low level, is against the public interest and as he shows  little  or
    no concern for the norms of behaviour.

12. There is little evidence of  any  integrating  factors  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  There is no statement from the appellant's  brother  nor  any
    evidence of him holding employment in the United Kingdom or,  for  that
    matter, being in a relationship with any other  person.   There  is  no
    indication that he has children here and other than seeking  employment
    over an extended period, there is little or no evidence of his economic
    activity in this country.

13. Taking all of these factors into account and I am satisfied that on the
    particular facts of this case the decision to deport  is  proportionate
    and I therefore remake the appeal by dismissing it.
Summary of Conclusions

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. I remake the appeal by dismissing it on all grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State for the Home Department appeals with  permission
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana promulgated on 24
    May 2018 in which she allowed Mr Nysztal's appeal against a decision of
    the Secretary of State dated 2 March 2018 to make a  deportation  order
    against him pursuant to the Immigration Act 1971  and  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

 2. Mr Nysztal arrived in the United  Kingdom  relatively  recently,  first
    coming to the attention of the authorities on 9 October  2017  when  he
    was arrested on suspicion  of  burglary.   The  following  day  he  was
    convicted of possession of a knife  in  a  public  place  and  also  of
    burglary and theft.  He was sentenced for  a  total  of  three  months'
    imprisonment which was suspended for two years and required to place  a
    victim surcharge of �115.00.

 3. The Secretary of State's case is set out in her refusal letter, but  in
    essence it is her view that  the  respondent  presents  a  genuine  and
    sufficiently serious threat to public interest, such that he should  be
    deported, the Secretary of State concluding also that deportation would
    in this case be proportionate.

 4. The judge heard evidence from Mr Nysztal who was  not  represented  and
    she accepted that he was remorseful.  She also took  into  account  the
    offences of burglary in Poland for  which  he  was  given  a  five-year
    suspended sentence.  She took into account his  personal  circumstances
    and that he could return to Poland and integrate there.  She  concluded
    that he had demonstrated he is not a potential danger, given the  crime
    he committed was opportunistic, concluding that public policy  and  the
    fundamental interests of society and the appellant's  circumstances  do
    not make this a proportionate decision to deport him  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  SH concluded: "I find that the public interest  will  not  be
    compromised because the appellant does not constitute a present  threat
    to the requirements of public policy or public security, therefore  the
    deportation would not be proportionate."

 5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on  the  basis  that
    the judge misdirected herself in respect of the decision in  Essa;  had
    not given sufficient weight to the offending  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    overlooking that he had been convicted of burglary as well as theft and
    that the judge had failed to provide adequate reasons  as  to  why  she
    concluded that he would not present a genuine and sufficiently  serious
    threat to public policy or security.

 6. I consider, having heard  submissions  from  Mr  Tarlow  and  from  the
    respondent, that the judge did err.  What the judge has failed properly
    to do is to explain how she came to the conclusion that  the  appellant
    did not represent a genuine present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society  yet  the  judge
    accepted that the crime is opportunistic and that  the  respondent  had
    committed offences of burglary in Poland  and  that  he  had  committed
    crimes in the United Kingdom.  The suspended sentence is at  the  lower
    level, but what the  judge  did  not  do  is  firstly  address  herself
    properly as to the relevant test and then to explain properly  why  the
    appellant did  not  constitute  a  sufficiently  serious  threat.   The
    wording of the decision at [43] and [44] is different from the test and
    there is no indication that  the  judge  has  properly  considered  the
    seriousness of the offending or the seriousness of the threat that  the
    respondent provides.  On that basis I consider that  the  decision  did
    involve the making of an error of law and I set it aside.

 7. A question then arises as to whether I send this back to the First-tier
    to make it again or whether I remake the decision  today.   I  conclude
    that it would be better to remake on a later date once the issue of the
    exact nature of the respondent's sentence in Poland is clarified.   The
    respondent states his  sentence  was  suspended  for  five  years;  the
    Secretary of State that he received five years' imprisonment,  yet  the
    PNC record shows sentences of three years six months, and three  years,
    said to be a total of five years.  There is  a  significant  difference
    between these, and the evidence from the PNC record does not appear  to
    be make sense.

Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. The decision will be remade in the Upper  Tribunal  on  a  date  to  be
    fixed.

Directions

Mr Nysztal must within 28 days of the issue of this  decision  send  to  the
Upper Tribunal and to the Home Office Presenting Officer's Unit  a  document
from the Polish Authorities confirming the criminal  sentences  he  received
in Walbrzych on 20 February 2013

No anonymity direction is made.
