Department (unaccompanied minors - Art  17  Dublin  Regulation  -  remedies)
[2017] UKUT 00124 (IAC)








  The Queen on the application of RSM, a child by his litigation friend ZAM
                                   and ZAM
                                                                  Applicants
                                      v


                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                 Before The Hon Mr Justice McCloskey, President
                          Upper Tribunal Judge Finch






      I) The question of whether the Secretary of State has made a  decision
         on the exercise of the discretionary power in  Article  17  of  the
         Dublin Regulation is one of fact which will be  determined  on  the
         basis of evidence, direct or inferential.


     II) Article  17  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Dublin  regime.   The
         suggestion that the Article 17 discretion  falls  to  be  exercised
         only where the family reunification criteria in Article 8  are  not
         satisfied is misconceived.


    III) Article 17 has a role in circumstances where one of the overarching
         values of the Dublin Regulation, namely expedition,  is  not  being
         fulfilled in the procedures and systems of the host Member State.


     IV) Relevant government policy statements  constitute,  as  a  minimum,
         material considerations  to  be  taken  into  account  in  deciding
         whether to exercise the discretionary power  in  Article  17.   The
         Lumba principle is also engaged.


      V) The judicial assessment of the efficacy of the Dublin  systems  and
         procedures in  the  host  Member  State  will  invariably  be  fact
         sensitive and will take  into  account  the  overarching  aims  and
         objectives of the Dublin Regulation, including the  maintenance  of
         inter-Member  State  solidarity  and  mutual  trust  and   respect,
         together with expedition.


     VI) Expedition has special force in the case of unaccompanied children.




    VII) The discretion to judicially determine essentially academic  issues
         in judicial review proceedings will normally  be  informed  by  the
         overriding objective.

                             JUDGMENT

Introduction

 1. We emphasise at the outset that both Applicants continue  to  have  the
    protection  of  anonymity  and  reproduce  below  the  extant  Tribunal
    Direction.   Accordingly,  no  report  of  these  proceedings  or   any
    communication whatsoever shall directly or indirectly  identify  either
    of the Applicants or any member of their family.

 2. These judicial  review  proceedings  were  conducted  in  two  orthodox
    phases.  First, there was an inter-partes hearing on 05  December  2016
    when the issue of permission was determined. By our ex tempore decision
    and order of the same date (subsequently formalised: see  Appendix  1),
    we granted the Applicants permission to apply for judicial  review  and
    made certain directions.

 3. An inter-partes substantive hearing followed, on 19 December  2016.  By
    our ex tempore decision  and  order  of  the  same  date  (subsequently
    formalised -  see  Appendix  2),  the  Applicants  were  held  to  have
    succeeded.  The order made by the Tribunal against the Respondent,  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (the "Secretary  of  State")
    was formulated thus:


      a) The Secretary of  State  is  hereby  ordered  to  admit  the  first
         Applicant, RSM, to the United Kingdom.


      b) It is hereby  declared  that  there  has  been  a  failure  by  the
         Secretary of State to lawfully exercise the discretion conferred by
         Article 17 of the Dublin Regulation.


    Most recently, further orders have materialised, under  the  rubric  of
    liberty to apply: see Postscript.


 4. None of  the  aforementioned  decisions/orders  sets  forth  fully  the
    Tribunal's reasoning and analysis.  The second decision  in  particular
    could not be delayed having regard  to  the  facts  and  factors  which
    underlay the Tribunal's conclusion that the  Applicants  must  succeed.
    The Tribunal made  clear  to  the  parties  that  it  would  provide  a
    comprehensive judgment if necessary, particularly in the event  of  the
    Secretary of State seeking permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
     An application of this kind having materialised, the  Tribunal  hereby
    honours its commitment.  While this may regrettably entail some  degree
    of repetition, this seems to us unavoidable.

 5.  Judicial  review  proceedings  are  frequently,  but  not  invariably,
    conducted within  a  framework  of  agreed  and/or  uncontroversial  or
    neutral facts.  This does not always apply  to  cases  of  the  present
    species, mainly  on  account  of  the  factor  of  expedition  and  the
    resulting limited opportunity of the Respondent, the Secretary of State
    for the Home Department  (the  "Secretary  of  State"),  to  carry  out
    appropriate investigations.  Thus, as in previous cases of  this  kind,
    we shall  address  infra  the  question  of  whether  the  key  factual
    ingredients of the  Applicants'  case  have  been  established  to  the
    requisite degree

 6. While there was a clear  and  obvious  need  for  expedition  in  these
    proceedings,  the  Tribunal  was  able  to   devise   case   management
    mechanisms, both prior to the permission hearing and by creating a post-
    permission phase in advance of the substantive hearing, which furthered
    two imperatives.  First, the Applicants and their legal representatives
    were enabled  to  augment  the  evidence  presented  initially  to  the
    Tribunal.   Second, the Secretary of State was  afforded  a  reasonable
    opportunity to make an evidential contribution and, in the event, a not
    insubstantial contribution materialised.  Notably, at the  final  stage
    of the proceedings,  namely  the  substantive  hearing,  there  was  no
    suggestion on behalf of the Secretary of State of unfairness on account
    of excessive haste.


RSM's Background

 7. It is asserted that the first Applicant, RSM, is a national of Eritrea,
    aged 14 years and has been residing in Rome since  April  2016,  having
    fled his country of origin and, subsequently, Yemen with his mother and
    younger brother who, tragically, lost their lives  (with  many  others)
    whilst attempting the journey by sea from Egypt to Italy.   The  second
    main assertion in the Applicants' case is that the second Applicant  is
    his adult aunt who, having previously been recognised as a refugee  and
    having acquired British citizenship, lives in the United Kingdom and is
    willing and able to receive the first Applicant and care for him.

 8. RSM's case possesses the following additional factual ingredients.   He
    had an uneventful childhood in his country of  origin,  Eritrea,  where
    the family unit included his mother and  younger  brother,  during  his
    first 10 years approximately.  The family fled Eritrea,  travelling  to
    Yemen where they lived for approximately 3 years.   War  having  broken
    out in Yemen, they then fled to Sudan and onward to Egypt,  accompanied
    by an older relative, his father's first cousin.


 9. Following a sojourn of some three months in Egypt, all four arranged to
    travel by sea to Italy.  A sudden and  unplanned  separation  from  his
    mother and brother having intervened, RSM and father's cousin made  the
    hazardous crossing successfully.  Soon thereafter, contact by telephone
    having been maintained in the  intervening  period,  RSM's  mother  and
    younger brother died in June 2016 by drowning in undertaking  the  same
    journey.  They and many others lost their lives in one of  the  refugee
    maritime tragedies which have, sadly, become so commonplace during  the
    last couple of years.  This happened some weeks following RSM's arrival
    in Italy and, inevitably, had a devastating effect on this then 13 year
    old boy.

10. RSM was initially accommodated in a Rome  refugee  camp  following  his
    arrival around April 2016.  There he shared a  room  with  an  Eritrean
    woman and another child, as a short term  measure.   His  status  being
    that of unaccompanied minor, though not thus  recognised  initially,  a
    change in his accommodation  arrangements  was  effected  in  September
    2016.  Since then, he has been accommodated  in  two  State  registered
    children's homes.  This has been his plight during the last four months
    approximately.    The   evidence   concerning   his   conditions    and
    circumstances there is both balanced and well researched.  Furthermore,
    it is uncontentious and we accept  it.   The  adult  relative  who  had
    accompanied RSM on his journey by sea from Egypt to Italy remained with
    him for a period.  Being unplanned, this was a temporary measure.  They
    were separated when RSM was transferred to the children's home.  In his
    witness statement the relative  says the following:


         "Things have been very difficult for [RSM].  ......   He  has  lost
         his mother and younger brother and all that he has known. He is now
         separated from me and is not with family ..... [He] is desperate to
         be reunited with his aunt and her  family  and  it  is  all  he  is
         focusing on but as time passes with nothing happening, he is losing
         hope that this will be achieved. He is  really  suffering.   He  is
         very upset and confused and he is very unhappy."

    This statement is dated 01 November  2016.   The  intermittent  contact
    between the  two  ended  in  December  when  the  father's  cousin  was
    transferred from Italy to Portugal.

11. In the span of several witness statements, the  second  Applicant,  ZAM
    (RSM's aunt), recounts, inter alia, the four visits she has made to RSM
    in Italy during the period June to  November  2016.   These  statements
    provide evidence of very recent vintage.  They confirm the  changes  of
    accommodation noted above.  In her most evidence,  the  aunt  describes
    RSM as "even more unhappy and distressed and  is  increasingly  angry",
    with elaboration.  She states:

         "I am really worried about how he is  coping  with  these  terrible
         losses.  I believe he needs my direct support every day and that it
         is really bad for him to be in a children's home in  Italy.  He  is
         expressing much more anger and I don't know how his  emotions  will
         continue to change.  I still worry that if he  is  not  transferred
         quickly he may try to take matters into his own hands ....


         While he is happy to see me, when I leave  this  causes  upset  and
         hurt all over again ....


         I am concerned about the long term impact that the  insecurity  and
         separation will have on RSM and that the longer  it  goes  on,  the
         more damage the deaths of his mother and brother will cause and the
         greater the difficulty he will have in settling into life and being
         a child again in the UK."


  12. ZAM's most recent witness statement, composed  just  days  before  the
      substantive hearing, contains the following:


         "I would describe RSM in some senses of [sic] being like a computer
         ....


         When .....  I had first arrived and when I was leaving he was  like
         the black screen of the computer,  he  was  turned  off  blank  and
         emotionless ....


         It has been almost unbearable for me to understand how much RSM  is
         suffering when I am not there and being able to do so little  about
         it ....


         It is very hard to explain to a child who is just 14 and after what
         he has been through why this process should take so long ....


         Although RSM has now started to go to school, he tells me he 'hates
         it' ....  and he gets 'sad memories' of his brother who he went  to
         school with .... I'm concerned that if he becomes  resentful  about
         the home that he may decide to run away from it....


         Even though he was angry at [his father's cousin] he  knew  he  was
         there and that he could  see  him.   I  think  it  will  feel  very
         different to him knowing he is completely alone in Italy ....


         It is very well known within the Eritrean community that there is a
         smuggling route for children and adults to  travel  from  Italy  to
         France and from there to the UK ...  I am not personally  aware  of
         anyone who has come to the UK via a lawful  route  from  Italy.   I
         know that RSM is aware  of  this  and  he  has  asked  directly  if
         travelling to France and then to the UK is an option  for  him.   I
         have counselled him against this ......"




13. In other parts of the evidence RSM  is  described  as  "a  particularly
    vulnerable boy" and is contrasted with more street wise and mature boys
    of less than his age.  His adult cousin (ZAM's oldest daughter)  states
    that RSM -


         "....  seems even more deeply traumatised ..... he has become  very
         negative and no longer believes good things will happen to  him.  I
         think in some respects he has lost his rationality  ....   As  time
         goes on, he is losing trust and faith in us and we  fear  that  one
         day RSM, a young adolescent boy, may decide to take matters in  his
         own hands and abscond."




    In this context, Mr Scott, in his most recent statement, draws  on  his
    personal experience of unaccompanied migrant children "disengaging from
    the  legal  process",  adverting  to  factors  including   "conflicting
    information  from  those  in  the  community  and  smugglers  and  peer
    pressure" and the propensity of some  teenage  boys  to  take  reckless
    risks.  These risks were taken by children in the "Jungle"  in  Calais,
    France in spite of the sustained efforts of community leaders  and  the
    support  provided   by   charitable   organisations   and   volunteers.
    Comparable support structures have been absent  from  RSM's  life.   Mr
    Scott's second witness statement exhibits an Oxfam report published  in
    September 2016 which states:


         ".....   the  Italian  reception  system  has  turned  out  to   be
         inadequate for protecting lone refugee  and  migrant  children  and
         their rights.  Even worse, during the first  six  months  of  2016,
         5,222 unaccompanied children were reported missing, having run away
         from reception centres.  They become  invisible,  under  the  legal
         radar and are  therefore  even  more  vulnerable  to  violence  and
         exploitation."


    RSM's Mental Health

14. One of the main evidential planks of RSM's case is  the  report  of  Dr
    Claire O'Driscoll, a Clinical Psychologist, who travelled to Rome where
    she assessed RSM on 02 September 2016 at the  offices  of  the  charity
    Medecins Sans Frontiers.  Dr O'Driscoll  also  engaged  in  discussions
    with certain other named persons. It is  evident  from  her  curriculum
    vitae that she  has  experience  and  expertise  in  the  psychological
    assessment of young people.

15. Dr O'Driscoll's report is thorough and comprehensible.  Dr O'Driscoll's
    report ranges from the  general  to  the  particular.  As  regards  the
    former, it contains the following notable passage:

         ".... It is imperative to remember that all children need  shelter,
         protection, nurturance, sense  of  belonging  and  support.   These
         needs are regarded as basic; essentials  that  must  be  met  to  a
         secure platform for developmental  attainment  and  positive  well-
         being  ....  and  to  protect  against  a  plethora   of   negative
         psychological, educational and social outcomes."


    She opines that children  with  the  kind  of  history  which  RSM  has
    experienced, with its ingredients of  pre-migration  trauma  and  post-
    migration tragedy and other life events, are  "....   at  an  increased
    risk of developing mental health difficulties".

16. Dr O'Driscoll's assessment of RSM is that  he  is  "a  very  vulnerable
    adolescent".  He satisfies the diagnostic criteria  for  post-traumatic
    stress  disorder.   There  are   no   indications   of   invention   or
    exaggeration.  In his current circumstances no provision  is  made  for
    his emotional and social needs.  His life lacks stability and security.
     Dr O'Driscoll expresses the following opinion:

         "The  continued  delay  in  resolving  RSM's  immigration  position
         presents as  a  significant  perpetuating  factor  to  his  current
         psychiatric disorder.  It also puts him at increased  risk  of  his
         mental health  deteriorating  further.   Delays  in  resolving  his
         immigration status will ensure that he will not  receive  the  care
         and support that he needs as he navigates his  recent  bereavements
         and endures his mental health symptoms ....


         RSM's mental health will deteriorate further the longer he  remains
         separated  from  his  family,  especially  when  he  moves  to  the
         accommodation for minors. He needs to join his family in the UK  so
         that he can begin to process the loss of his mother and brother and
         establish a new sense of security and normality."


17. Dr O'Driscoll  expresses  an  opinion  regarding  the  following  three
    specific issues (the headings are ours):

      i) RSM's move to children's accommodation:


         "....  He will potentially be even more isolated and  receive  less
         emotional support ....  [and] may be expected to care  for  himself
         independently, which when one considers his current mental state is
         beyond what any 13   year old should be expected to do."




     ii) Recovery from his PTSD:


         He is "...  at increased risk of his  mental  health  deteriorating
         further ....  [and] Recovery from his current psychiatric disorders
         is not possible until he has joined his family."




    iii) Risk of Suicide:

         "Further deteriorations in  his  mental  health  could  impair  his
         already diminished daily  functioning  or  precipitate  a  suicidal
         crisis."


    The theme that the perpetuation of  RSM's  current  circumstances  will
    have an adverse impact on his fragile mental health and will delay  his
    recovery shines brightly in Dr O'Driscoll's report.

18. A further dimension  has  materialised.  Dr  O'Driscoll  was  asked  to
    comment  on  the  most  recent  of  the  second   Applicant's   witness
    statements.  She suggests a possible "....  deterioration in his mental
    health ...  accounted for by an increase in the intensity of  his  PTSD
    symptoms ... an exacerbation of the negative impact of  the  trauma  on
    his current  mental  health."   Elaborating,  Dr  O'Driscoll  describes
    parental death as "one of the most traumatic events that can  occur  in
    childhood, noting simultaneously the absence of bereavement,  emotional
    and spiritual support for RSM."  Dr O'Driscoll  emphasises  (in  terms)
    RSM with  access to psychiatric or psychological assessment and if  and
    insofar as necessary, a range of treatments:  trauma-focuses  cognitive
    behavioural therapy  and  narrative  exposure  therapy  in  particular,
    delivered by a trained mental health  professional.   She  repeats  her
    concern about the risk of further deterioration in RSM's mental health.

19. The most recent evidence bearing on this discrete subject  is  provided
    via the witness statements of ZAM and  SA,  digested  in  [11]  -  [13]
    above.




The Dublin Procedures In Italy

20. The second main tranche of evidence assembled relates  to  the  systems
    and procedures for the processing of Dublin Regulation claims in  Italy
    and, more particularly, how these have  been  actually  functioning  in
    RSM's specific case.  The evidence bearing on this  issue  has  evolved
    and now includes a significant contribution on behalf of the  Secretary
    of State (infra).

21. It is convenient to reproduce here the core pleading on this  issue  in
    the grounds of challenge:

         "[RSM] wishes to claim asylum and is entirely willing  to  register
         an asylum claim in Italy.  He has, however, been unable to do so to
         date and all indicators are that there  is  likely  to  be  lengthy
         further delay ....


         Under Italian law, children are not legally competent  to  register
         an asylum claim and are  unable  to  do  so  until  a  guardian  is
         appointed.  However, due in particular to the unprecedented refugee
         crisis, there are extremely lengthy delays in  the  appointment  of
         guardians in Italy.  There are then two stages to  registering  the
         claim, which are likely to take several weeks  or  more,  following
         which a referral might be made to the Dublin III Unit  to  consider
         making a take charge request to the responsible Member  State.   It
         is unclear in practice how long the Dublin III  process  will  take
         once an asylum claim is registered because there are no known cases
         of  Dublin  III  transfers  of  unaccompanied  minors  to  the  UK.
         However, indications are that at minimum, the maximum time frame of
         11 months under Dublin III is likely to be required."

    The sources of this evidence  include  the  Applicants'  solicitor,  Mr
    Scott, together with several respected and well informed  international
    organisations - UNCHR and  AIDA  in  particular  -  and  certain  major
    charities: UNICEF, Save  the  Children  and  the  Refugee  Council.  Mr
    Scott's sources are,  in  summary,  a  range  of  published  materials,
    several reputable international organisations  and  certain  identified
    Italian immigration lawyers.


22. We take  the  example  of  UNCHR  (there  are  other  examples).   This
    organization has described the Dublin Regulation process  in  Italy  as
    "painfully  slow".   There  is  no  publicly  funded  legal  advice  or
    assistance.  Italian law requires the appointment of a guardian in  the
    case of every unaccompanied child.  This can generate delays of  up  to
    eight months.  Furthermore, the guardians have no specific training  in
    the asylum field. More fundamentally, the guardianship system in  Italy
    is creaking under acute pressures in the prevailing refugee crisis  and
    is widely held to be under funded.

23. The evidence indicates that once the important milestone of  appointing
    a guardian has been attained, the child's claim for asylum is  compiled
    and registered.  As the present case illustrates, the gap between these
    two events can be considerable.  This phase  can  occupy  time  periods
    ranging from weeks to months.  The next phase consists  of  examination
    of the asylum claim.  This triggers the three time limits prescribed by
    the Dublin Regulation, namely any  take  charge  request  addressed  by
    Italy to the United Kingdom must be transmitted  within  three  months;
    the United Kingdom must respond thereto within two months or, where the
    transmitting state so stipulates, one month; and the  acceptance  of  a
    take charge request gives rise to a further period of  six  months  for
    effecting transfer to the United Kingdom.

24. At this juncture we record certain landmark dates and events:


      i) RSM has been known to the Italian authorities since, at the latest,
         29 April 2016 when he was assigned to a refugee camp in Rome.


     ii) On 03 June 2016 the  tragic  death  of  RSM's  mother  and  younger
         brother occurred.  Since then the sole aim of RSM and his relatives
         has been to achieve  unification  with  ZAM  and  her  family,  all
         lawfully resident in the United Kingdom.


    iii) During the initial phase the Italian authorities evidently did  not
         understand the real nature of the relationship between RSM and  his
         father's adult cousin.  At  the  beginning  of  the  second  phase,
         marked by the  aforementioned  tragedy,  there  was  a  failure  to
         identify RSM as an unaccompanied, orphaned child seeking asylum and
         striving for unification with his family in the United Kingdom.


     iv) A letter dated 11 August 2016 written  by  the  Director  of  RSM's
         refugee camp and addressed to the Applicants' solicitors (available
         in Italian only) appears to have played a significant role  in  the
         correct assessment of RSM and his transfer  to  a  State  home  for
         children.


      v) The first clear recognition by the  Italian  authorities  of  RSM's
         status  of  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking  child  occurred  on  13
         September 2016 (some five months after his arrival in the country).


     vi) The appointment of a guardian for RSM (the Mayor of Rome)  occurred
         on 21 October 2016.


    vii) On 16 November 2016 RSM's  fingerprints  were  taken,  marking  the
         first stage of the asylum process.


   viii) Then the next stage of the asylum process, involving  an  interview
         of RSM, was scheduled for 04 January 2017.  This step,  in  theory,
         would have precipitated the formal  registration  of  RSM's  asylum
         claim.




  25. On the date when we promulgated our ex tempore judgment,  19  December
      2016 (see Appendix 2), the state of the Applicants'  evidence  was  as
      rehearsed above.  In the events which occurred, the Tribunal  remained
      involved, pursuant to the invocation of liberty to apply on behalf  of
      the Applicants  and  certain  further  ancillary  orders  ensued.   It
      suffices to say that a "take charge" request in  respect  of  RSM  was
      transmitted by the Italian authorities to the Secretary of State, this
      request was accepted  and,  ultimately,  the  necessary  authorisation
      order was given by the relevant Italian Court.  The net result  was  a
      delay of two months between our decision and Order of 19 December 2016
      and RSM's eventual admission to the  United  Kingdom  on  16  February
      2017.  We observe only that there are question marks about the acts  -
      and omissions - of the Secretary of State's officials throughout  this
      period, including the bewildering  failure  to  send  this  Tribunal's
      crucial order of 22 December 2016 to the Italian authorities.


The Secretary of State's Evidence

26. It is appropriate to preface  the  evidence  filed  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State with certain  Ministerial  statements  providing  an
    insight into the United Kingdom Government's published policy  in  this
    field.  These statements were made in the context of the advance of the
    Immigration Bill through the two chambers  of  Parliament.   The  first
    clear policy, statutory in nature,  finds  expression  in  what  became
    known as the "Dubs Amendment", dating from 21 March 2016:


         "Unaccompanied Refugee Children: Relocation and Support


          1)     The Secretary of State must, as soon as possible after the
             passing of this Act, make  arrangements  to  relocate  to  the
             United  Kingdom  and  support  3,000   unaccompanied   refugee
             children from other countries in Europe.


          2)     The relocation of children under (1) shall be in  addition
             to the resettlement of children under the  Vulnerable  Persons
             Relocation Scheme."


    This later became section 67 of the Immigration  Act  2016,  though  in
    modified form, omitting reference to 3,000 children and  requiring  the
    appropriate number to be determined by the Government after  consulting
    with local authorities.


27. On 21 April 2016 the Minister for Immigration gave a written  statement
    to Parliament concerning what later became known  as  the  children  at
    risk resettlement programme which described as the results of -

         " .......... work with UNHCR and informed by  a  round  table  with
         NGOs, local authorities and devolved administrations to  provide  a
         resettlement route to the UK, specifically designed  for  'children
         at risk' from the Middle East and North Africa region ......


         This  broad  category  encompasses   unaccompanied   children   and
         separated children - those  separated  from  their  parents  and/or
         other family members - as well as other vulnerable children such as
         child carers and those facing  the  risk  of  child  labour,  child
         marriage or other forms of neglect, abuse or exploitation ....


         We will commit to resettling several  hundred  individuals  in  the
         first year with a view to resettling up to 3,000  individuals  over
         the lifetime of this Parliament,  the  majority  of  whom  will  be
         children."


    That Statement also said as follows with regard to  Dublin  III  family
    reunification:


         "It is important to  use  the  tools  available  to  help  children
         reunite  with  family  wherever  possible.   The   Government   are
         committed to meeting our obligations under the  Dublin  regulation.
         We have seconded additional resource to the European Asylum Support
         Office totally over 1,000 days  of  expert  support  to  Italy  and
         Greece to implement and streamline the Dublin process, including to
         quickly identify children who qualify for family reunion.   And  we
         continue to  work  with  the  French  authorities  to  address  the
         situation  in  Calais,  including  through  a  permanent  bilateral
         standing committee to  improve  cooperation  on  Dublin  transfers,
         particularly family reunion.
         ....


         The recent secondment of a  senior  asylum  expert  to  the  French
         Interior Ministry to improve  the  process  for  family  cases  has
         already resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of
         children being reunited with family in the  UK.  In  the  last  six
         weeks 24 cases have been accepted  for  transfer  to  the  UK  from
         France under family unity provisions, more than half of  whom  have
         already arrived in the UK. Once an asylum claim has been lodged  in
         another member state we have demonstrated that transfers  can  take
         place within weeks."




    In the Parliamentary debate which followed on 10 May 2016, the Minister
    said the following in answer to a question regarding the implementation
    of the Dubs amendment:


         "Clearly, there is a renewed focus given our acceptance of the Dubs
         amendment to the Immigration Bill.  I absolutely want to  use  that
         as a means of speeding up and making more effective the  processing
         of those with links to family in the UK.  Vulnerable  children  can
         then be reunited with their extended family in the UK, which is  in
         their best interests, and will no longer  be  isolated  in  France,
         Italy or Greece."




    The Minister continued:


         "As I have said, we want to make rapid progress.   We  are  already
         taking children with family connections to the United Kingdom  from
         France and we want to find ways of improving the process further so
         that, when cases are identified, we can take charge and ensure that
         those children come  to  the  UK  quickly.   There  are  vulnerable
         children in Italy and Greece, which is precisely why we are opening
         a dialogue with those  countries.   We  want  to  understand  their
         systems properly and join up with them effectively so that  we  can
         identify such children and act to  enable  them  to  come  to  this
         country."




28. Government policy is also ascertainable from one of  its  publications,
    entitled "Immigration Act  2016  Fact  sheet  -  Unaccompanied  Refugee
    Children (Section 67)", dated July 2016.  This contains inter  alia,  a
    series of "Key Questions and Answers", including the following:


         "How will this work with the Dublin Regulation? .......


         The Government will continue to work with other  Member  States  to
         ensure that the Dublin Regulations,  including  the  provisions  on
         family unity, can work quickly and effectively.  Over  30  children
         were accepted for transfer under Dublin from France between January
         and April this  year  and  there  are  many  more  cases  in  train
         following  intensification  of  co-operation  between  the  UK  and
         France, which  included  the  secondment  to  the  France  Interior
         Ministry of a senior UK expert.  We had a secondee  in  the  Dublin
         Unit in Italy and are about to send another to the Dublin  Unit  in
         Greece .....


         We expect the Dublin Regulation will provide  the  legal  framework
         for the transfer from other European Countries of many of the cases
         that fall under the Act.  Our aim is to  use  whatever  tools  work
         best for the countries and partners concerned and give us the  best
         chance of transferring children quickly."


    [Our emphasis]


    To similar effect is the statement made by the Minister  of  State  for
    the Home Office in Parliament on 31 October 2016:


         "More widely in Europe, we  are  in  active  discussions  with  the
         UNHCR, other  partner  organisations  and  the  Italian  and  Greek
         Governments to strengthen and speed up mechanisms to  identify  and
         assess unaccompanied refugee children and transfer them to  the  UK
         where that is in their best interests ..... I believe we should  be
         acting in the best interests of the child and for  that  reason  we
         are focusing on prioritising family reunion cases."


         [Our emphasis.]




    We consider  that  the  witness  statements  filed  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State fall to be evaluated  by  reference  to  the  policy
    framework ascertainable from the above quotations.




29. Carl Dangerfield is the author of one of the witness  statements  filed
    on behalf of the Secretary of State.  He describes himself as the  UKVI
    Immigration Liaison Officer in Italy, where he has  worked  within  the
    Italian  Interior  Ministry  since  March  2008.   His  duties  include
    "enhancing" the effective implementation of the Dublin  Regulation  and
    promoting "best practice on  asylum  and  immigration".   Recently  his
    duties  have  focused  particularly  on  asylum  seeking  unaccompanied
    children.

30. Stimulated by an electronic communication from  a  colleague  dated  27
    September 2016, Mr Dangerfield, on 10 October 2016, first became  aware
    of RSM's case and immediately discussed it with an Italian case worker.
     Enquiries established that RSM had been transferred from the reception
    centre to a  children's  home  and  an  identified  social  worker  was
    awaiting judicial authority to  represent  RSM  in  lodging  an  asylum
    claim.  Mr Dangerfield's subsequent understanding was that the  Italian
    Dublin Unit was "organising an eventual fast track process" in  respect
    of RSM.  Some 6 weeks later, on 23 November  2016,  the  social  worker
    confirmed  to  Mr  Dangerfield  that  she  had  attended  the  "Italian
    Immigration Office" and had been allocated a formal interview  date  of
    04 January 2017 for "the next stage of the process".  The following day
    Mr Dangerfield enquired of the Head of the Italian Dublin Unit  whether
    the  processing  of  RSM's  asylum  claim  could   be   "speeded   up".
    Chronologically, Mr Dangerfield's evidential contribution ends at  this
    point.  His witness statement was made just under one month later.

31. From Mr Dangerfield's witness statement,  one  distils  an  unequivocal
    acknowledgment of delay in the Italian system in  RSM's  case.   In  an
    exhibited email, dated 14 October 2016, Mr Dangerfield stated:


         "The delay with the case has been with the initial confusion that
         the minor was accompanied and then the adult stated that the child
         was unaccompanied."


    As the other evidence  summarised  above  demonstrates,  this  discrete
    period of delay  was  approximately  four  months'  duration.  Judicial
    intervention, via these proceedings, ultimately  occurred  at  a  stage
    when RSM had been in Italy for some eight  months.   During  the  first
    half of this period, his case made no progress whatsoever  through  the
    Italian system.  We deduce from Mr Dangerfield's clear  statement  that
    but for the erroneous classification of RSM by the Italian authorities,
    his case would have begun progressing some four months previously.



32. This discrete context possesses the following main ingredients:


      a) By their first letter to the  Home  Office,  dated  26th  September
         2016, the Applicant's solicitors provided  a  detailed  outline  of
         RSM's case, advanced the contention that the United Kingdom  had  a
         duty to admit RSM under Article 8 ECHR and continued:


             "For the avoidance of any doubt our client RSM seeks to  claim
             asylum and have this claim determined in the UK and the UK has
             the  power  under  Article  17   of   Dublin   III   to   take
             responsibility for this case.  We would submit that this power
             should be exercised now ...."




      b) This was followed by a formal pre-action  protocol  letter  to  the
         Home Office dated 10  October  2016,  which  attached  the  earlier
         letter.  It stated in particular:


             "By this letter we are asking you for the second time to  take
             the  necessary  steps  to  facilitate  his  entry  to  the  UK
             immediately using your discretionary powers to grant leave  to
             enter and/or pursuant to Article 17 of Dublin III."




      c) The Home Office made no response to either letter.


      d) Next, on 02 November 2016, these proceedings were  initiated.   The
         Claim Form sought the twofold relief of:


          i)     A declaration that the Respondent's  refusal  to  consider
             and to exercise her discretion under Article 17 Dublin III  or
             otherwise admit [RSM] to the UK is unlawful and


         ii)     a mandatory order requiring the Respondent to admit RSM to
             the United Kingdom forthwith.




      e) On 22 November 2016 the Secretary of  State's  Summary  Grounds  of
         Defence  were  served  and  filed.   This  does  not  so  much   as
         acknowledge, much less  respond  to,  the  Applicants'  case  under
         Article 17 of the Dublin Regulation.




33. This Tribunal was alert to the series of omissions  outlined  above  at
    the stage of determining the permission  application.   Permission  was
    granted following an inter - partes hearing on 05  December  2016.   In
    our decision/order and directions of  the  same  date,  this  Tribunal,
    inter alia,  explained  its  preference  for  severing  the  permission
    hearing from the substantive hearing, stating at [9]:


         "...  We are not satisfied that the Respondent's  duty  of  candour
         has been discharged at this stage."


    It continued, at [14]:


         "(a)     We direct  the  Secretary  of  State  to  file  a  witness
             statement.  This will be  made  by  a  suitably  informed  and
             senior official of the Home Office.  It will  address  all  of
             the issues bearing on the Dublin Regulation process for  [RSM]
             and, insofar as material, more widely.  It will  also  address
             the emails and the rather bare recent letter ....


         (b)      The witness statement will  further  be  directed  to  the
             question of the second Applicant: broadly,  the  Secretary  of
             State's  position  vis-�-vis  the  second  Applicant  and   in
             particular any steps or enquiries  which  should  properly  be
             made  on  that  front  at  this  stage  or  any  justification
             proffered for inertia in this respect ....


         (c)       The  witness  statement  will  attach   all   documentary
             materials which are required in the discharge of the Secretary
             of State's duty of candour."


    In the final paragraph of its decision/order, this Tribunal stated,  at
    [16]:


         "Finally, the absence of any reference to Article 17 of the  Dublin
         Regulation in the Respondent's case is noted."




34. At this juncture, we  revisit  Ms  Farman's  first  witness  statement.
    Addressing the issue of the Secretary  of  State's  "discretion"  under
    Article 17, she states:


         "I should point out that other Member States will make take  charge
         requests to the UK under Article 17  as  well  as  Article  8.   In
         general   the SSHD would only exercise her discretion under Article
         17 in a case where an individual had some family links  to  the  UK
         but where he or she fell outside of  Article  8.   If  Home  Office
         officials received evidence that there  was  a  close  relationship
         between the unaccompanied minor and the family  member  in  the  UK
         which,  although  not  falling  within  Article  8  of  the  Dublin
         [Regulation] was akin to such a relationship, the SSHD would likely
         consider using Article 17 to bring the minor to the United  Kingdom
         ....


         I should also explain that with regard to transfers  under  Article
         17 although they are within the SSHD's discretion,  this  does  not
         mean that she simply will notify the Member State where  the  minor
         is that the UK will process the minor's asylum claim and  that  the
         Home Office will arrange  transportation.   Home  Office  officials
         would instead enter into a dialogue with the  authorities  of  that
         Member State given they have custody of the child.  It  would  also
         be  for  the  transferring  Member  State  to   make   the   travel
         arrangements for a transfer under Article 17 whether or not a  take
         charge request had been made under the Article ...


         It is difficult without a lengthy  exercise  to  establish  exactly
         when the SSHD has exercised her discretion to accept a take  charge
         request under Article 17 as the data is not  easy  to  interrogate.
         For  example,  a  request  under  Article  8(1)  might  become   an
         acceptance under Article 17(1).  In the time  available,  the  SSHD
         has not been able to carry out this process ...


         My understanding is that as RSM was being processed under Article 8
         of the Dublin III Regulation, the SSHD has focused her attention on
         encouraging the Italians to work through this process  rather  than
         seeking to try to bring RSM to the United Kingdom  through  Article
         17.  To have two parallel routes of proceeding would have  confused
         matters and as per the above, would not have resulted in RSM coming
         to the United Kingdom any more quickly ....


         I would also say more  generally  that  all  Member  States  across
         Europe understand how the Dublin III Regulation works and what they
         are required to do when transferring children.  If the SSHD were on
         a more frequent basis to seek  to  try  and  unilaterally  rely  on
         Article 17 to transfer children to the UK, especially if they  were
         already within the auspices of Article 8, in  my  view  this  would
         cause confusion and take away the true  integrity  and  purpose  of
         Article 8 family reunification."


         [Emphasis added.]




35. The further issue addressed in Ms Farman's  witness  statement  is  the
    Secretary of State's approach to issues of expedition.  She avers:


         "...  The Dublin III  process  works  across  Europe  so  that  the
         transferring Member State makes the  arrangements.   While  we  can
         encourage the transferring Member State  to  expedite  matters,  we
         cannot compel them to do so in respect of particular cases as  this
         is purely a matter for them ....


         It would be inappropriate for the SSHD to seek to interfere in that
         process as (i) she would be interfering in the sovereign affairs of
         another Member State and (ii) she is not aware of all the  relevant
         factors which will have led a particular Member State  to  organise
         matters in the way that it has."

    With specific reference to RSM's case, Ms Farman avers:

         "The SSHD has sought to expedite RSM's case as  appropriate  taking
         into account the factors above."


    In this context, Ms Farman attaches two letters from the Home Office to
    the relevant Italian authorities, dated 21  November  and  09  December
    2016 respectively.  Each of these letters merely  states  that  in  the
    event of a "take charge" request materialising, this will be considered
    with expedition in the United  Kingdom.   Neither  letter  requests  or
    advocates expedition on the part of the Italian authorities.  We  shall
    revisit this issue infra.


    The Dublin Regulation Challenge


36. It is convenient to  consider  the  Applicant's  Article  17  challenge
    first.  As already noted, this limb of the Applicant's challenge  seeks
    the following relief:


         "A declaration that the Respondent's refusal  to  consider  and  to
         exercise her discretion under Article 17 of Dublin III or otherwise
         admit [RSM] to the United Kingdom is unlawful."


    In the supporting grounds, this is developed by the contention that the
    Secretary of State has erred in law in failing to consider the exercise
    of her discretion under Article 17.




37. During recent years, substantial quantities of judicial ink  have  been
    spilled in addressing the aims, rationale and structures of the  Dublin
    Regulation in its successive incarnations.  It is unnecessary to add to
    any of this for present purposes.  Rather, bearing in mind the  present
    litigation context, it suffices to draw attention to its most important
    provisions.  We have assembled these in Appendix 3 hereto.

38. The Secretary of State's resistance to the Article 17 relief pursued by
    the Applicants is predicated firmly on the basis that a decision  under
    Article 17 has been made in RSM's case.  This decision, it  is  argued,
    takes the form of a refusal to exercise discretion.  The second element
    of the Secretary of State's case in this respect is that  this  refusal
    is lawful.

39. Our conclusion on the first of these issues  is  easily  made.   It  is
    abundantly clear that prior to the initiation of these proceedings  and
    pace the pre-action letters written by the Applicant's  solicitors,  no
    consideration  was  given  to  exercising  the  Secretary  of   State's
    discretion under Article 17.  This finding is based  on  the  evidence.
    There is no evidence, direct  or  inferential,  upon  which  any  other
    finding can reasonably be made.  The second phase to be  considered  in
    this  context  is  that  which  elapsed  between  the  commencement  of
    proceedings and the permission  hearing.   Once  again,  based  on  the
    evidence, there is no dispute that no  Article  17  decision  was  made
    during this period.  Ultimately, the witness  statement  of  Ms  Farman
    provided the territory upon which this particular issue was  contested.
    Mr Ruck-Keene submitted that the Tribunal should construe  Ms  Farman's
    first statement to the effect that a decision under Article 17 has been
    impliedly made.

40. We are bound to reject this submission, earnestly though it  was  made.
    We have reproduced in [35]-[36] above the key passages in  Ms  Farman's
    main statement.  We are quite unable to construe these  in  the  manner
    advocated.  We have taken particular note of the  language  and  tenses
    employed and the synthesis.  We are also alert to the context in  which
    Ms Farman's witness statement was generated: see [31 - [34] above.  The
    Secretary of State, via Ms Farman, was gifted a gilt-edged  opportunity
    to demonstrate in evidence that consideration had in fact been given to
    exercising the discretion conferred by Article 17.  The evidence  which
    materialised in consequence falls manifestly short of showing this.  Ms
    Farman's averments are couched in the most general and  abstract  terms
    imaginable.  Furthermore, and in any event,  from  the  perspective  of
    reliability  her  statement  suffers   from   multiple   unsatisfactory
    references to her  "understanding"  of  various  matters.   Insofar  as
    certain averments are based on "the documents and records available  to
    me" (witness  statement,  paragraph  3),  the  materials  attached  are
    extremely limited and, as regards this issue, irrelevant.  Ms  Farman's
    evidence suffers from the further infirmity that it was  necessary  for
    her to make a second witness statement in  order  to  correct  material
    inaccuracies in the first.

41. It follows inexorably from our analysis above, that the first  limb  of
    the Applicants' challenge succeeds.  We would add the following,  given
    the comparative novelty of Article 17 challenges and the quality of the
    arguments advanced and the clear impression created in the evidence and
    via counsel's submissions that the Secretary of State views Article  17
    of the Dublin Regulation through an inappropriately narrow lens.

42. One of the keys to the correct understanding and application of Article
    17 is that it forms an integral part of the  machinery  established  by
    the Dublin Regulation.  Accordingly, it is to be understood and applied
    in a manner which furthers the aims and objectives of  this  instrument
    of EU legislation. Article 17 in no  way  corrupts  or  undermines  the
    Dublin Regulation machinery: quite  the  opposite.   The  Secretary  of
    State evidently considers that the Article 17 discretion  falls  to  be
    exercised only where the family  reunification  criteria  enshrined  in
    Article 8 are not satisfied: see [35] above.  This approach is, in  our
    view, misconceived.  This argument was founded  on  Recitals  (17)  and
    (18)  [Appendix 3]. However, it overlooks the key words "in particular"
    in  Recital  (17).   Furthermore,  it  neglects  the  breadth  of   the
    discretion conferred by the language of  Article  17(1).   It  is  also
    incompatible with the "in particular" qualification in  Article  17(2).
    We are further satisfied that the broader construction which we  favour
    is compatible with the principles of solidarity and  mutual  trust  and
    respect enshrined in Recital (22) and Article 12  of  the  implementing
    Regulation.

43. We consider in particular that Article 17 has a role  in  circumstances
    where one of the overarching values of the  Dublin  Regulation,  namely
    expedition, is not being fulfilled in the procedures and systems of the
    host Member State in any given case.  The  present  case,  imbued  with
    powerful  humanitarian  elements  and  significant  delays  in   Italy,
    provides a concrete illustration of the potential operation of  Article
    17.  Beyond this we do not venture since this is not a case in which  a
    negative decision under Article 17 is subject to the supervisory review
    of this Tribunal.

44. We also draw attention to the guidance provided by the Court of  Appeal
    in Secretary of State for the Home Department v ZAT and  Others  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 810.  While Article 17 did not feature  in  the  challenge  at
    first instance - see [2016] UKUT 61 (IAC) it  surfaced  at  the  appeal
    stage in consequence of certain arguments  devised  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State.  At [85] the court stated:

            "A further reason for rejecting Mr Eadie's  submission  in  its
           absolutist form is Article 17  of  the  Dublin  III  Regulation.
           Since the relevant officials in the  second  Member  State  have
           power to assume responsibility in a case in which the Regulation
           assigns it to another Member State, it cannot be said that it is
           never open to an individual to request that state  to  do  that.
           Mr Eadie suggested, or came  close  to  suggesting,  during  the
           course of the hearing that a refusal to exercise the power under
           Article 17 was  not  justiciable.   That,  in  my  judgment,  is
           unsound  in  principle  and  also  finds  no  support   in   the
           authorities.  Abdullahi v Bundesasylamt recognised only that the
           second Member State has a wide margin of discretion in  deciding
           whether to assume responsibility pursuant to  the  provision  in
           the Dublin II Regulation that is the equivalent of  Article  17.
           In a context in which the exercise of power relates to relations
           between two Member States  as  to  the  operation  of  a  treaty
           arranging for the allocation  of  responsibility  for  examining
           applications for asylum between Member States, this  is  clearly
           correct."

      The court  then  helpfully  illuminated  the  contours  and  scope  of
      judicial review challenge in this context:

            "There will be a wide range of relevant considerations for  the
           decision-maker to take into account: see all  the  factors  that
           the Upper Tribunal stated were relevant  to  the  assessment  of
           proportionality.  But subject to the effective scope of judicial
           review being narrower for  this  reason,  the  exercise  by  the
           Secretary of State of her discretion is subject to the  ordinary
           public law principles of  propriety  of  purpose,  relevancy  of
           considerations, and  the  longstop  Wednesbury  unreasonableness
           category and, because of the engagement of ECHR Article  8,  the
           intensity of review which is appropriate in  the  assessment  of
           the proportionality of any interference with Article 8 rights."

45. The reference to "all the factors that the Upper Tribunal  stated  were
    relevant to  the  assessment  of  proportionality"  is  illuminated  by
    reference to [37] of the court's judgment:

            "The factors which were said to tip the balance  in  favour  of
           all or some of the first four Applicants were summarised at [55]
           as:- age; mental disability;  accrued  psychological  damage;  a
           clear  likelihood   of   further   psychological   turmoil   and
           disturbance, a best case scenario involving a  delay  of  almost
           one year; the previous family life in their  country  of  origin
           enjoyed by all seven Applicants; the pressing  and  urgent  need
           for family reunification on the  very  special  facts  of  these
           cases; the wholly inadequate substitute for family reunification
           which pursuit of the Dublin Regulation avenue  would  entail  in
           the short to medium term; the absence of any parent or  parental
           figure in the lives of the first four Applicants; the  potential
           that family life would be re-established  very  quickly  if  the
           first  four  Applicants  were  permitted  to  enter  the  United
           Kingdom; the availability, willingness and capacity of the  last
           three Applicants to provide meaningful care and support  to  the
           first four; and  the  avoidance  of  the  mentally  painful  and
           debilitating fear, anxiety and uncertainty which the first  four
           Applicants will, predictably,  suffer  if  swift  entry  to  the
           United Kingdom cannot be achieved."

      We would add, by way of almost otiose guidance, that every  case  will
    of course be intensely fact sensitive.  However,  the  significance  of
    these passages is that all of the factors identified by  this  Tribunal
    are, in principle, capable  of  being  legitimate  ingredients  in  the
    proportionality balancing exercise and, independently, are  capable  of
    having the status of obligatory considerations to be taken into account
    in the Article 17 context.


46. We consider that the Article 17 issue  has  one  further  dimension  of
    significance.  In [26] - [28] above, we have focused  on  a  series  of
    ministerial pronouncements which we consider  to  have  the  status  of
    United Kingdom Government policy statements.  Every discretion  in  law
    has, in principle, the potential to be exercised within a domain  which
    includes  an  associated  policy  adopted  by  the   public   authority
    concerned.  This, in our judgement, is precisely such  a  case.   While
    the  ministerial  statements  are  couched  in  general  terms,   their
    orientation is consistent and unmistakable.  Viewed through  the  prism
    of orthodox  public  law  doctrine,  they  constitute,  as  a  minimum,
    material  considerations  to  be  taken  into  account  where  relevant
    discretionary powers fall  to  be  exercised.   On  this  limb  of  the
    Applicant's case, the discretionary power in play is that contained  in
    Article 17 of the Dublin Regulation.  All the evidence considered as  a
    whole, it is clear that no consideration was at any time given  by  the
    Secretary of State's officials to  the  relevant  published  Government
    policies.  This is an obvious and free standing vitiating factor.

47. In this context reference to the Lumba principle is  also  appropriate.
    This was articulated by Lord Dyson in these  terms:


           "... A decision maker must follow his published policy (and  not
           some different unpublished policy) unless there are good reasons
           for  not  doing  so.   The  principle  that   policy   must   be
           consistently applied is not in doubt ..."


      (Lumba v SSHD [2012] 1 AC 245, per Lord Dyson JSC at [26])



    It is generally held that this  principle  has  its  roots  in  another
    hallowed principle, namely the equal implementation of laws, in  tandem
    with non-discrimination and the avoidance of arbitrariness.



48. It is convenient at this juncture to  express  our  view  -  obiter  of
    course - on the effect of a failure of this species in the context of a
    human rights challenge.  In human rights cases, the  question  for  the
    court or tribunal concerned is  whether  the  decision  of  the  public
    authority under challenge infringes the  human  right  engaged.   Where
    statutory appeals are concerned, the judicial authority must  confront,
    and answer, this question.  However, where the challenge is pursued via
    the medium of judicial review, as in this  case,  some  calibration  is
    required.  All of this was addressed in extenso in the decision of this
    Tribunal in R (SA) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]
    UKUT 536 (IAC), at [17] - [30], considered in the  recent  decision  of
    the Court of Appeal in R (Caroopen and Myrie) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 1307.

49. Bearing in mind that we did not receive full argument on this issue, we
    confine ourselves to two propositions,  recognising  that  these  might
    require reconsideration with the benefit of  more  extensive  argument.
    The first is that Government policy statements may, in principle, sound
    on the issue of legitimate aim.  The second is that a  failure  by  the
    decision maker to  take  into  account  a  relevant  Government  policy
    statement  may  illuminate  the  judicial  assessment  of  whether  the
    impugned decision is a proportionate means of furthering the legitimate
    aim in play.




The Article 8 ECHR Challenge

50. The test to be applied to this limb (the  second)  of  the  Applicant's
    challenge requires consideration of the decision of the Court of Appeal
    in ZAT.  At [95] the court stated:

           "I consider that applications such as the  ones  made  by  these
           respondents  should   only   be   made   in   very   exceptional
           circumstances where they can show that the system of the  Member
           State that they do not wish to use,  in  this  case  the  French
           system, is not capable of responding adequately to their  needs.
           It will, in my judgment, generally be necessary  for  minors  to
           institute the process in the country in which they are in  order
           to find out and be able to show that the  system  there  is  not
           working in their case.  This is subject to the point that, as  I
           have stated, these cases  are  intensely  fact-specific.   There
           will be cases of such urgency or of  such  a  compelling  nature
           because of the situation of the unaccompanied minor that it  can
           clearly be shown that the Dublin system  in  the  other  country
           does not work fast enough.  The case of  the  Syrian  baby  left
           behind in France when the door of  a  lorry  bound  for  England
           closed after his mother got onto the lorry  referred  to  in  Mr
           Scott's fourth statement is an example.  But save in such cases,
           I consider that those representing persons in  the  position  of
           the respondents should first seek recourse from the  authorities
           and the courts of the Member State in which the minor is.   Only
           after it is demonstrated that  there  is  no  effective  way  of
           proceeding in that jurisdiction  should  they  to  turn  to  the
           authorities and the courts in the United Kingdom."


    The first part of this guidance is properly understood  only  when  one
    recognises that none of  the  claimants  in  ZAT  had  made  an  asylum
    application under the Dublin Regulation.  Those in this  position  must
    demonstrate "very exceptional circumstances" in order to succeed in  an
    Article 8 claim brought in this jurisdiction.


51. That is not this case since RSM has engaged  with  the  Italian  Dublin
    Regulation system and has continued to do so up to the  point  of  this
    Tribunal's intervention.  We consider  it  clear  from  the  final  two
    sentences of [95] that the Court of Appeal  made  a  clear  distinction
    between engaging and  non-engaging  immigrants.   RSM  belongs  to  the
    former category.  In his case, therefore, the main  question  for  this
    Tribunal is whether it is demonstrated that there is no  effective  way
    of proceeding in Italy.

52. We have emphasised the word  "effective"  for  the  following  reasons.
    First, the judicial assessment of  efficacy  will  invariably  be  fact
    sensitive, intensely so.  Second, efficacy must be measured against the
    overarching aims and objectives of the Dublin Regulation.  Third, these
    aims include the maintenance of solidarity and mutual trust and respect
    among the Member States of the Union.  Fourth, crucially in the present
    context, the aims and objectives also include the  overarching  aim  of
    expedition.  Fifth,  expedition  has  special  force  in  the  case  of
    unaccompanied children in general - in this particular case  expedition
    is especially acute.

53. We consider it uncontroversial to suggest that RSM's  case  was  crying
    out for anxious attention and enquiry and maximum expedition  from  the
    beginning of June 2016, when  the  tragic  deaths  of  his  mother  and
    younger  brother  became  known  to  all  concerned.   His  erroneously
    assessed status during the previous two months (the first phase) may be
    understandable: but this merely served to augment the overall period of
    inaction and delay.  We recognise that this  Tribunal's  assessment  of
    the period of almost seven months which have elapsed subsequently  (the
    second phase) must be cautious, given that there is limited evidence of
    the reasons why it has taken so  long  to  achieve  so  little  in  the
    Italian system and, furthermore, the evidence of relevant Italian  laws
    and procedures is not comprehensive. Caution is also  dictated  by  the
    notorious fact that Italy is one of two EU Member States (Greece  being
    the other) which have borne the brunt of the refugee crisis in  Europe.
    Furthermore,  it  is  no  function  of  this  Tribunal  to  conduct  an
    exhaustive review of the acts and omissions  of  the  relevant  Italian
    authorities, including the judicial agencies.

54. Thus we confine ourselves to certain  basic  and  clearly  demonstrated
    facts.  We consider it appropriate to juxtapose early June 2016 with  a
    future date (as of the date of the substantive hearing  -  19  December
    2016) namely 04 January 2017.  In doing so we take into account all  of
    the other landmark dates and events noted above.  This simple  exercise
    exposes an unmistakable and glaring reality: RSM's claim for asylum has
    not yet been registered in Italy and 04  January  2017  represents  the
    earliest date when this event may occur.  This  is  particularly  clear
    from Ms Farman's letter of 09 December 2016 to the Italian Dublin  Unit
    in Rome.  It is equally clear that this crucial  milestone  would  have
    been attained some months ago but for the erroneous assessment that RSM
    was not an unaccompanied  child:  see  Mr  Dangerfield's  email  of  14
    October 2016 to his colleague.  This Tribunal does not sit in judgement
    of this error. Indeed it readily acknowledges the scope for human error
    in these cases.  Rather, it takes this into account as one of the facts
    and  factors,  objectively  demonstrated,  to   be   weighed   in   the
    proportionality balancing exercise.

55. Next, we turn our attention to the likely post-January  2017  scenario.
    It is common case that, as a matter of probability, Italy will transmit
    to the United Kingdom a "take charge" request in respect of  RSM.   The
    crucial issue in this respect is timescale.  The  evidence  bearing  on
    this  issue  provides  this  Tribunal  with  no  confidence  that   the
    expedition required in this particular, fact  sensitive  case  will  be
    achieved. We elaborate   as follows.

56. First, there is no  evidence  whatsoever  emanating  from  the  Italian
    authorities: we record this simply as a fact.  Second, the Secretary of
    State's evidence is vague and non-committal in this respect: see [30] -
    [36] above.  Third, the evidence of the three concrete cases  in  which
    Italian "take charge" requests have been accepted by the United Kingdom
    discloses post-request delays ranging from almost four months  to  just
    under eight months.  We acknowledge that in two of these cases the take
    charge request was communicated just  under  one  month  following  the
    registration of the asylum claim.  In this respect, the data concerning
    the third of the three concrete cases are not available.

57. In the present case, we take into account that the United  Kingdom  has
    made no plea to the Italian authorities for expedition in  RSM's  case.
    We  weigh  also  the  absence  of  any  indication  that  the   Italian
    authorities   will   proceed   with   any   enhanced   expedition    or
    prioritisation.  Based on the evidence provided  by  the  Secretary  of
    State (which we emphasise), while RSM is likely to be the subject of  a
    "take charge" request directed to the United Kingdom, this, based on an
    assumption  of  no  supervening  currently   unforeseen   obstacle   or
    complication, is unlikely to materialise until  the  beginning  of  May
    2017 (at best) and the beginning of September 2017 (at worst).  This is
    our balanced forecast   of the probabilities based on all the available
    evidence.

58. We are mandated to  view  the  best  interests  of  RSM  as  a  primary
    consideration under both municipal law, via  section  6  of  the  Human
    Rights Act 1998 (Article 8 ECHR), together with EU law i.e. the  Dublin
    Regulation.  In our judgement the best interests of  this  child  point
    unremittingly and incontestably towards  immediate  reunification  with
    the only family left to him.  This ranks as a primary consideration  in
    the task we are performing.  In El Ghatet v Switzerland [Application No
    56971/10], the ECtHR stated recently, at [46]:



           "The Court has further held that there  is  a  broad  consensus,
           including in international law, in support of the idea  that  in
           all decisions concerning children, their best interests must  be
           paramount (see Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland  [GC],  no.
           41615/07, � 135, ECHR 2010; M.P.E.V. and Others v.  Switzerland,
           no. 3910/13, � 52, 8 July 2014; see also Tarakhel v. Switzerland
           [GC], no. 29217/12, �  99,  ECHR  2014  (extracts)).   For  that
           purpose, in cases regarding family reunification the Court  pays
           particular attention to the circumstances of the minor  children
           concerned,  especially  their  age,  their  situation  in  their
           country of origin and the extent to which they are dependent  on
           their parents (see Tuquabo-Tekle and Others, cited above, � 44).
            While the best interests of the child cannot be a "trump  card"
           which requires the admission of all children who would be better
           off  living  in  a  Contracting   State   (I.A.A.   and   Others
           v. the United Kingdom, cited above, � 46; see  also  Berisha,
           cited above, �� 60-61), the domestic courts must place the  best
           interests of the child at the heart of their considerations  and
           attach crucial weight to it (see, mutatis  mutandis,  Mandet  v.
           France, no. 30955/12, �� 56-57, 14 January 2016)."



    Ultimately, our assessment of  RSM's  best  interests  emerges  as  the
    determinative factor in the proportionality balancing exercise.




59. We juxtapose the pronouncement in El Ghatet  with  what  the  Court  of
    Appeal stated, in ZAT at [84]:

           "The  need  for  expedition  in  cases  involving   particularly
           vulnerable persons such as unaccompanied children is  recognised
           in the Regulation and authorities such as Case  C-648/11  R  (MA
           (Eritrea)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] 1
           WLR 2961 and Manchester City Council v Pinnock [2010]  UKSC  45,
           [2011] 2 AC 104 at [64].
           ....
           I  accept  Ms  Demetriou's  submission  that  the   urgency   of
           particular circumstances may require a shorter period  than  the
           periods specified as long stops in the Regulation."

    The court added, at [87]:

           "There will be a need for expedition  in  many  cases  involving
           unaccompanied minors."


    And at [90]:

         "Cases such as these are intensely fact sensitive."


    We do not overlook the  imperatives  which  the  court  identified  and
    balanced in [87]:

           "The  circumstances  of  the  first  four  Respondents'   cases,
           especially the psychiatric evidence, suggested  in  their  cases
           there was a particular need for urgency.  But an orderly process
           is also important in cases of unaccompanied minors.  The need to
           examine their identity, age and  claimed  relationships  remains
           and  there  is  a  particular  need  to  guard  against   people
           trafficking."


      We observe that none of these imperatives operates to the detriment of
      the relief pursued  by  the  Applicants  in  these  proceedings.   The
      conduct of this litigation and, in particular, the facilities afforded
      to the Secretary of State  to  address  certain  issues  and  to  file
      evidence  between  the  permission  and   substantive   stages,   were
      specifically designed to ensure that the Tribunal would be  adequately
      informed about issues of this kind.  Furthermore, the order  which  we
      propose to make accommodates any legitimate concerns about RSM's  best
      interests and recognizes fully the roles and responsibilities  of  the
      Italian authorities, judicial and otherwise.




60. We pose again the  question  distilled  from  [95]  of  ZAT:  have  the
    Applicants demonstrated that RSM's asylum claim which,  at  its  heart,
    entails a plea to be transferred to the United Kingdom under Article  8
    of the Dublin Regulation, is not being  efficaciously  processed?   The
    formulation of  this  question  is  yet  another  illustration  of  the
    intensely fact sensitive questions to be expected in litigation of this
    genre.  The answer to this question  requires  a  balanced,  evaluative
    judgement on the part of the judicial authority concerned.  Every  such
    evaluative judgement  is  measurable  against  familiar  standards  and
    criteria: the need to take into account all material facts and factors,
    the importance of disregarding  the  immaterial  and,  ultimately,  the
    avoidance of  irrationality.   A  constant  alertness  to  all  of  the
    governing legal rules and principles which we have  outlined  above  is
    also fundamental.  We have approached our task in this way.

61. In our summarised, ex tempore decision promulgated on 19 December  2016
    we addressed the Applicant's  challenge  by  reference  to  the  higher
    standard of very compelling circumstances.  While, as explained  above,
    we consider that a somewhat less  onerous  standard  applies  to  those
    (such as RSM) who have engaged with the Dublin Regulation system of the
    Member States concerned, this matters not as we  have  determined  this
    challenge by reference to the higher test.  We stated at [8]:


         "We are of the opinion that the Applicants'  challenges  are  well-
         founded.  The ZAT threshold of  very  compelling  circumstances  is
         overcome. Stated succinctly, RSM's personal circumstances,  on  any
         showing, belong towards  the  upper  end  of  the  notional  highly
         compelling spectrum and, based on the evidence  amassed  (which  we
         emphasise), the Italian Dublin Regulation system has not served him
         with the anxious attention, efficacy or expedition  for  which  his
         unique, highly fact sensitive situation  has  been  pleading  since
         April 2016 or June 2016 at latest.  Eight months later we  consider
         judicial intervention appropriate."

    Elaboration  is  neither  appropriate  nor  necessary.   This   passage
    expresses our evaluative  judgement  on  the  efficacy  issue  in  this
    intensely fact sensitive context.  It  follows  that,  in  this  unique
    case, the second limb of RSM's challenge succeeds also.


    Order

62. Giving effect to our conclusions above we order as follows:

        a) The Secretary of State is hereby  ordered  to  admit  the  first
           Applicant, RSM, to the United Kingdom.

        b) It is hereby declared that there  has  been  a  failure  by  the
           Secretary of State to lawfully exercise the discretion conferred
           by Article 17 of the Dublin Regulation.

        c) There shall be liberty to apply.

    As regards (a), we decline to impose any time limit  for  admission  as
    this duly respects  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Italian
    authorities and provides a layer of protection for RSM: see [60] above.
     Furthermore, this species of orders has operated successfully in other
    cases and the mechanism of liberty to apply, in (c), can be invoked  if
    necessary.



Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

63. We are minded to grant permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal,  on
    account of:

        a) The desirability of the Court of Appeal pronouncing  on  whether
           this Tribunal has erred in law in its approach to the case of  a
           vulnerable unaccompanied child who has initiated and pursued the
           Dublin Regulation process  in  the  host  Member  State,  having
           regard to predictable further  legal  challenges  of  a  similar
           kind. While the question of whether an error  of  law  has  been
           committed in the application  of  established  principles  to  a
           highly fact sensitive matrix is  unlikely  to  qualify  for  the
           grant of permission to appeal in  many  instances,  we  consider
           this course appropriate in the present case taking into  account
           the changing profile of  this  species  of  litigation  and  its
           progressive escalation.


        b) The novelty and importance of the Article 17  Dublin  Regulation
           issues: the essential question for the Court of Appeal  will  be
           whether  this  Tribunal  has  erred  in  its  construction   and
           application of Article 17.  Our consideration of and  conclusion
           in relation to governmental policy  statements,  in  [47],  will
           also fall to be considered as a discrete issue.


  64. In essence, therefore, we grant permission in  respect  of  the  first
      three of the Secretary of State's four grounds of appeal.   We  refuse
      permission relating to the fourth, as it is based on the  demonstrably
      misconceived premise that this Tribunal made "...  a  mandatory  order
      requiring the Respondent's immediate admission to the UK  ....."  [our
      emphasis].  Immediate admission was not ordered: see [62](a)  of  this
      judgment and order.  Our reasons for  declining  to  impose  any  time
      limit were explained fully  in  the  immediately  succeeding  passage.
      The reconfigured species of mandatory order which followed  under  the
      mechanism of liberty to apply - see  [68]  below  -  occurred  in  the
      circumstances rehearsed in the transcripts of the ex  tempore  rulings
      made on the dates noted, 24 January and  09  February  2017.   We  are
      unable to  identify any arguable error of law of significance in  this
      Tribunal's exercise of discretion in its selection of the  appropriate
      public law remedy in the quite different and intensely fact  sensitive
      circumstances pertaining some considerable time following the grant of
      the  initial  remedy  -  in  a  context  in  which,  in   the   events
      materialising, the  initial  remedy  did  not  provide  practical  and
      effective relief to  the  first  Applicant,  RSM.  Contrast,  in  this
      respect, R (O) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2016]
      UKSC 16, at [50] especially.


  65. While we have taken note of the submissions on behalf of the Applicant
      relating to the possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court  in  ZAT
      and Others providing authoritative guidance on the issues  arising  in
      these proceedings,  we  cannot  overlook  the  significant  degree  of
      uncertainty concerning the future of any appeal in that  case  arising
      out of  the  imponderable  of  the  availability  of  public  funding.
      Furthermore, the  Article  17  and  policy  issues  arising  in  these
      proceedings are peculiar to  the  present  case.  Finally,  continuing
      developments in this Chamber suggest that a not  insubstantial  number
      of other cases will benefit from the Court  of  Appeal  reviewing  the
      correctness in law of what we have decided.


  66. We are, however, persuaded that there  is  merit  in  the  Applicants'
      arguments relating to costs, in one respect and we grant permission to
      appeal subject to the condition that the costs order specified in [67]
      below will not be stayed.  While we take cognisance  of  the  separate
      argument advocating a further condition whereby the Respondent  should
      pay the Applicants' reasonable  costs  on  appeal  in  any  event,  we
      consider that this is one step too far in  the  circumstances  and  is
      premature in a context where it would be inappropriate to attempt  any
      forecast  of  the  outcome  of  any  legal  aid  application  or   any
      application to the Court of Appeal for a protective costs  order.  The
      Court of Appeal will be the appropriate forum for the ventilation  and
      determination of further costs issues of this kind.


Costs

67. We order:

        i) the Secretary of State shall pay the Applicants'  costs,  to  be
           assessed in default of agreement.


       ii) the Applicants' costs shall be assessed as their publicly funded
           status requires.


Postscript

68. On 20 January 2017 the mechanism of liberty to  apply  was  invoked  on
    behalf of RSM as he had not been admitted to the United Kingdom.   This
    resulted in further listings before the Tribunal on 24 January  and  09
    February 2107 and delayed the promulgation of this final judgment.  See
    [25] above.  This gave rise to further mandatory orders of the Tribunal
    requiring the Secretary of State to admit RSM to the United Kingdom  by
    a specified date and to equip him with a  travel  document  insofar  as
    necessary. Ultimately, the Applicant's admission to the United  Kingdom
    was effected on 16 February 2017. In  the  interests  of  economy,  the
    "liberty to apply" orders are not appended.
    .
69. Finally, during the liberty  to  apply  phase,  the  Applicants'  legal
    representatives invited the Secretary  of  State's  representatives  to
    formally concede that the Tribunal's order of 19 December 2016 had been
    breached.  We construe the Applicants' position to be one of pursuing a
    further remedy, in the form of a declaratory order, to reflect this. We
    shall treat this as a discrete, ancillary application.  The  concession
    sought was not provided.


70. It was implicit in our order dated 19 December 2016 that the  Secretary
    of State should effect the admission of the first  Applicant,  RSM,  to
    the United Kingdom within  a  reasonable  time.   The  Tribunal  would,
    clearly, be the arbiter of reasonableness in the event of  an  asserted
    breach.  During the "liberty to apply" phase, some further evidence was
    lodged on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State.   As  the  Applicants'
    representatives  acknowledge  in  their  application,   this   may   be
    incomplete and further evidence may  be  required.   We  consider  that
    directions for further evidence would indeed be necessary.  This  would
    inevitably give rise to increased costs and may, ultimately, require  a
    further hearing in order to determine the issue raised.


71.  We  remind  ourselves  that  judicial  review  remedies   are   always
    discretionary. As we have made clear in [64] above, remedies  in  cases
    of this genre should provide practical and effective relief. This is  a
    reflection of the factors of urgency and the plight  of  unaccompanied,
    isolated and vulnerable teenagers which characterise  this  species  of
    litigation. Weighing this with our assessment that  further  directions
    giving rise to further costs  and  delay  would  in  our  judgement  be
    necessary, we consider that the prolongation of this litigation for the
    purpose of obtaining a declaratory order which,  in  this  highly  fact
    sensitive context, would not provide a practical or efficacious  remedy
    or guidance of utility in other cases is not justified.


72. In thus concluding we have taken into account the principle articulated
    by the House  of  Lords  in  R  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department, ex parte Salem [1999] 1AC  450, at  453  per Lord Slynn:


         "My Lords, I accept, as both counsel agree, that in a  cause  where
         there is an issue involving a public authority as to a question  of
         public law your Lordships have a discretion  to  hear  the  appeal,
         even if by the time the appeal reaches the House there is no longer
         a lis to be decided which  will  directly  affect  the  rights  and
         obligations of the parties inter se ...


         The discretion to hear disputes, even in the  area  of  public  law
         must, however, be exercised with  caution  and  appeals  which  are
         academic between the parties should not be heard unless there is  a
         good reason in the public interest for doing  so,  as  for  example
         (but only by way of example) when a  discrete  point  of  statutory
         construction arises which does not involve  detailed  consideration
         of facts and where a large number of similar  cases  exist  or  are
         anticipated so that the issue will most likely need to be  resolved
         in the near future."




    We have also had regard to the exercise of the judicial  discretion  in
    the matter of public law remedies in the more recent  pronouncement  on
    this subject at the highest level in O (supra).

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).

Preface

I emphasise at  the  outset  that  both  Applicants  continue  to  have  the
protection of anonymity and reproduce below the extant  Tribunal  Direction.




Direction  - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  Applicants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Applicants and to the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1) This is a case of some urgency in which the Upper Tribunal has  acceded
    to the Applicants' request for expedition.  The proceedings  have  been
    processed and managed accordingly.  We outline in (2) - (5) below their
    skeletal framework.

 2) In very brief compass the  first  Applicant,  RSM,  is  a  national  of
    Eritrea aged 14 years and is currently residing in  Rome,  having  fled
    his country of origin and  subsequently  the  countries  of  Yemen  and
    Egypt, accompanied by his mother and younger brother at all times.  RSM
    was unexpectedly separated from his mother and younger brother  at  the
    point of departure in Egypt.  From there he  travelled  with  a  family
    relative to Rome where both lived together in  a  refugee  camp  for  a
    period of some few months.  During that period  RSM  learned  that  his
    mother and younger brother had tragically lost their lives,  with  many
    others, when later attempting the perilous crossing between  Egypt  and
    Italy.  That, very succinctly, sketches  the  first  chapter  of  RSM's
    story.

 3) The second main element of RSM's judicial review challenge  relates  to
    his living family members.  He has an adult aunt who, having previously
    been recognised as a refugee in the United  Kingdom,  resides  in  this
    country and is willing and able to receive and care for him.  This is a
    fact uncontested and of no little significance.

 4) The third main element in RSM's case is the  evidence  provided  by  Dr
    Claire O'Driscoll, a clinical psychologist whose expertise  extends  to
    teenagers.  Dr O'Driscoll  has  provided  a  comprehensive  report  and
    supplement.

 5) Fourth, there is tranche  of  evidence  relating  to  the  systems  and
    procedures in Italy for the  processing  and  determination  of  asylum
    claims under the Dublin Regulation generally, coupled with evidence  of
    how these are functioning in RSM's case.

 6) At the outset of today's hearing  we  canvassed  tentatively  with  the
    representatives certain possibilities and  options  for  the  continued
    conduct of these proceedings.  As the exchanges which materialised will
    have made clear, the  main  impetus  for  the  Tribunal's  inconclusive
    observations at this initial stage was the state of  the  Secretary  of
    State's case.   In  summary,  we  had  difficulty  in  identifying  the
    evidence (if any) provided by the Secretary of State and  we  expressed
    surprise at the absence of a witness statement in due discharge of  the
    Secretary of State's duty of candour.

 7) The  candid  response  made  by  Mr  Henderson  to  the  questions  and
    reservations raised by the Tribunal, supported by instructions provided
    by  the  GLD  solicitor  in  attendance,   confirmed   the   Tribunal's
    reservations in this respect.  Mr Henderson did not  seriously  contest
    this discrete issue.  His  submissions,  in  this  context,  were  well
    judged.

 8) One of the possibilities which the Tribunal canvassed  tentatively  was
    that of adjourning today's hearing.  Having heard the  presentation  of
    the Applicants' case by Mr Fordham who, as he  put  it,  presented  his
    arguments in full de bene esse, with the Tribunal's approval and in the
    course of further exchanges  between  Mr  Henderson  and  the  panel  a
    surprising  development  eventuated,  namely  an  application   by   Mr
    Henderson for an adjournment.  We rule  without  hesitation  that  this
    application is ill timed and has no merit in any event.  This is a case
    involving an unaccompanied 14 year old child whose plight  is,  on  any
    showing, acute.  It which has been granted expedition by the  Tribunal.
    That this adjournment application was not foreshadowed in  the  summary
    grounds of defence or in a formal application or by letter or email  or
    at the commencement of today's hearing in many ways speaks for  itself.



 9) That brings us to the next question.  Mr Fordham's stance is  that  the
    Tribunal should deal with this case as a rolled up hearing and  proceed
    to grant the Applicants final relief without more.  The  first  element
    of this submission has some merit  not  least  because  the  Tribunal's
    initial directions in this case did indeed list the hearing as a rolled
    up one.   The  reasons  why  the  Tribunal  began  to  reflect  on  the
    advisability and propriety of that course of action are the  following.
    First, the speedy 'rolled up' course seems  to  us  to  have  met  with
    disapproval in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in ZAT.  Second,  we
    are not satisfied that  the  Respondent's  duty  of  candour  has  been
    discharged at this stage.  Third, all of  the  evidence  points  to  an
    indeterminate and interim state of affairs  in  the  first  Applicant's
    case.  Fourth, it seems likely that the Applicants' evidence  could  be
    updated and augmented in certain material respects.

10) In particular, we are alive to the possibility  that  further  material
    evidence on behalf of the Applicants could be  assembled  and  produced
    within a very short timeframe.  For  example,  evidence  of  that  kind
    could make considerably clearer the stage which the  asylum  claim  has
    actually reached in Italy and what its short term prognosis  is.   Such
    evidence might  also  provide  us  with  a  clearer  picture  of  RSM's
    circumstances in what appears to be a state children's home and,  inter
    alia, whether he is in fact being  educated  there.   Further  evidence
    might also augment the evidential picture on the risk of absconding not
    just in general terms but more specifically in his case.  Those are the
    reasons why we identified certain options  at  the  outset  of  today's
    proceedings.  The Applicants' preferred course  of  action  is  crystal
    clear and we have given careful consideration to it.

11) The further ingredient in our approach at this stage of the proceedings
    arises from the  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  ZAT  and  in
    particular paragraph 95.  That should have been apparent, I trust, from
    my reference to the evidence bearing upon  the  current  stage  of  the
    Applicants' asylum claim and the short term prognosis.

12) Following careful probing, we understand  Mr  Henderson's  position  on
    behalf of the  Secretary  of  State  to  be,  first  of  all,  that  an
    adjournment is sought and, second  or  alternatively,  that  permission
    should be refused.  The basis of the latter submission is that based on
    the summary grounds of defence the Applicants' case does  not  overcome
    the threshold of arguability.  Mr Henderson has confirmed that any more
    extensive submissions he may wish to make would be addressed not to the
    question of arguability but rather  to  the  question  of  whether  the
    Applicants qualify for the grant of final substantive relief.

13) With some reluctance, we have come to the conclusion that we should not
    proceed with a rolled up hearing in these circumstances but temper that
    with  an  injection  of  the  maximum  expedition  which  we   consider
    appropriate in these circumstances.

    ORDER AND DIRECTIONS

14) We grant the Applicants permission to apply for judicial review.  Their
    case overcomes the modest threshold of arguability.  To this we add the
    following directions:

      a. We direct the Secretary of State to file a witness statement.  This
         will be made by a suitably informed and senior official of the Home
         Office.  It will address all of the issues bearing  on  the  Dublin
         Regulation process for this Applicant  and,  insofar  as  material,
         more widely.  It will address also the emails and the  rather  bare
         recent letter.

      b. The witness statement will further be directed to the  question  of
         the second Applicant: broadly, the Secretary  of  State's  position
         viz-a-viz the second Applicant  and  in  particular  any  steps  or
         enquiries which should properly be made on that front at this stage
         or any justification proffered for inertia in this respect.

         We recognise that a witness statement of this kind may legitimately
         contain hearsay evidence.  However, if it is made by a Home  Office
         official of suitable seniority and direct involvement  that  should
         be confined to a minimum.

      c. The witness statement will attach all documentary  materials  which
         are required in the discharge of the Secretary of State's  duty  of
         candour.

      d. The witness statement will be served and filed by 4  pm  on  Friday
         this week, that is 09 December 2016.

      e. The Applicants are at liberty to adduce further evidence.  The time
         limit for this step is 4 o' clock on 13 December 2016.

      f.    We list the substantive hearing  provisionally  on  19  December
         2016.

      g. The Applicants' solicitors will provide a full update in writing by
         16.00 on 15 December 2016

      h. Liberty to apply.

      i.    We reserve costs.

  15)  I elaborate on the liberty to apply provision as follow.  This is  an
      expedited case which is on a  fast  track.   We  do  not  consider  it
      appropriate to devise today a more prescriptive  timetable  than  that
      contained in the directions made.  However,  the  Applicants  will  be
      able, under the aegis  of  liberty  to  apply,  to  request  that  the
      substantive hearing be listed at very short notice indeed taking  into
      account the availability of the Tribunal and the  entitlement  of  the
      Respondent to be fully heard.

  16) Finally, the absence of any reference to  Article  17  of  the  Dublin
      Regulation in the Respondent's case is noted.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

               The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey, President
                       and Upper Tribunal Judge Finch




Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr M Fordham QC and  Ms  M  Knorr,  of  counsel,
instructed by Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, on behalf of the Applicants and Mr  D
Ruck-Keene, of counsel, instructed by the Government  Legal  Department,  on
behalf of the Respondent,  at  a  hearing  at  Field  House,  London  on  19
December 2016.


                 APPROVED EX TEMPORE DECISION AND ORDER


BOTH APPLICANTS CONTINUE TO HAVE THE PROTECTION OF ANONYMITY.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  Applicants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Applicants and to the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

    19 December 2016


    McCloskey J

 1)  We  shall  announce  our  decision  in  very  summary  terms  in   the
    circumstances.  Time is against all of us in this case and  we  do  not
    have the luxury of delivering  an  extensive  ex  tempore  judgment  or
    reserving.  What the parties need to know in every  case,  following  a
    hearing, is the result.  That is particularly true of the present case.
     What this means is that if a conventional  full  written  judgment  is
    required it will be provided in due course.

 2) In very brief compass, there are two Applicants for judicial review.  I
    take this opportunity to emphasise that  each  has  the  protection  of
    anonymity with the  result  that  nothing  should  be  disseminated  or
    published which identifies either Applicant directly or could have  the
    consequence of identifying them.

 3)  We have set out in outline in our earlier decision the  background  to
    these proceedings.  RSM, the first Applicant, is a national of  Eritrea
    aged 14 years.  He resides in Italy, isolated from family and  friends.
    He fled his country of origin,  travelling  through  the  countries  of
    Yemen and Egypt which he fled also.  Up to the point of  his  departure
    from Egypt he was accompanied by his mother and younger  brother.  They
    survived their traumatic experiences.  The events which  separated  RSM
    from his mother and younger  brother  were  unscheduled,  dramatic  and
    extremely  traumatic  for  him.   Worse,  regrettably,  was  to   come.
    Following a short sojourn in Italy he learnt of the appallingly  tragic
    circumstances of the deaths by drowning of his mother  and  sibling  in
    the course of their attempts to reunite the  three  family  members  in
    Italy.

 4)  The second judicial review Applicant is RSM's aunt, ZAM.  She  is  his
    adult aunt.  She resides in the United Kingdom where she was  initially
    a recognised refugee and is now a British citizen.   There  is  another
    family relative of no little importance, namely RSM's cousin who is  of
    course the daughter of the second Applicant ZAM. SA has,  with  others,
    made a not insignificant evidential contribution to  these  proceedings
    during their most recent phase.  SA is the oldest daughter of  ZAM  and
    she has one younger sister.

 5) These proceedings have been conducted in two phases.  The  first  phase
    came to a conclusion with our order of 05 December 2016 at which  stage
    we granted the Applicants permission to apply for judicial review.   It
    was quite clear to the Tribunal at that stage that having processed the
    proceedings on a fast  track  the  evidential  picture  was  incomplete
    bilaterally.  We addressed this firstly by requiring the  Secretary  of
    State to file a  witness  statement.   Secondly,  we  acknowledged  the
    potential further evidence to be provided on behalf of the Applicants.

 6)  The Tribunal did not of course know what the outcome  of  those  steps
    might be but, in the briefest of terms, dividing the  proceedings  into
    these two phases has had the consequence that the Tribunal at this, the
    conclusion of the second phase, is  considerably  more  fully  informed
    than at the earlier stage.  The evidence  provided  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State in the form of both witness statements  and  certain
    documentary evidence is as important for what it says and  contains  as
    for what it does not say and does not contain.  On the Applicants' side
    the additional evidence has provided the Tribunal with a  more  rounded
    insight into RSM's personal  circumstances  and,  secondly,  into  what
    emerges as a key question in these proceedings, namely how  the  Dublin
    Regulation system in Italy has worked for him to date, is  working  for
    him at the moment and is likely to continue working for him.

 7)  Time does not permit us to express in extenso our reasons  for  coming
    to the following conclusion, which we express at this stage.

 8) We are of the opinion that the Applicants' challenges are well-founded.
     The ZAT threshold of very compelling circumstances is overcome. Stated
    succinctly,  RSM's  personal  circumstances,  on  any  showing,  belong
    towards the upper end of the notional highly compelling  spectrum  and,
    based on the evidence amassed (which we emphasise), the Italian  Dublin
    Regulation system has  not  served  him  with  the  anxious  attention,
    efficacy or expedition for which  his  unique,  highly  fact  sensitive
    situation has been pleading since April 2016 or June  2016  at  latest.
    Eight months later we consider judicial intervention appropriate.

 9) In the circumstances prevailing  we  shall  confine  ourselves  to  one
    aspect of the relief claimed today.  We consider that a mandatory order
    should be made addressed to the  Secretary  of  State  in  terms  which
    mirror what is contained in paragraphs 36 (ii)  and  37  of  the  order
    dated 11 October 2016 made in the combined challenges  of  SA  and  AA,
    very recently decided (see SA & AA(R) v SSHD  [2016]  UKUT  (JR)  507).
    This is the real, practical and effective remedy which it is  essential
    for the Applicants to have as of today.

10)  We shall reflect a little further on the propriety of acceding to  the
    Applicants' quest to obtain relief in the second, that is  declaratory,
    form set forth in their claim  form,  namely  a  declaration  that  the
    Secretary of State has unlawfully refused to consider and exercise  her
    discretion under Article 17 of the Dublin Regulation.  All the evidence
    bearing on that has been of very late advent, as has the  argument  and
    we would like to consider both at a little further length.

11) The upshot is that we make a mandatory order  in  the  terms  indicated
    namely the Secretary of State shall admit the first  Applicant  RSM  to
    the United Kingdom.  The full import and rationale of that order is  as
    set forth in [37] of SA and AA.  We add and emphasise that there  shall
    be liberty to apply.  That is a measure which  provides  protection  to
    both the Applicants and the Secretary of State and achieves even-handed
    balance.

12) As the present case has (and certain other  recent  cases  have)  shown
    even more  dramatically  the  lines  of  communication  for  litigation
    instructions are surprisingly lengthy where the Secretary of  State  is
    concerned.  Thus we do not require  Mr  Ruck-Keene  to  commit  himself
    irredeemably today. To do so would be unfair and unreasonable. However,
    a stringent timescale is imperative. To this end, any  application  for
    permission to appeal will have to  be  made  on  notice  to  the  other
    parties by close of business on Wednesday 21 December 2016  viz  within
    48 hours.  If anything further is required from the  Tribunal,  whether
    under the aegis of liberty  to  apply  or  otherwise,  that  should  be
    notified by the relevant party to the Tribunal  within  the  same  time
    limit.


    22 December 2016


    Remedy


13) The Secretary of State is hereby ordered to admit the first  Applicant,

    Costs


     15) (i)      We order the Secretary of State  to  pay  the  Applicants'

      (ii)  The Applicants'  costs  shall  be  assessed  as  their  publicly
         funded status requires.

Decision(s) sent to above parties on:


Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).



            APPENDIX 3: THE DUBLIN REGULATION

[1]   We begin by considering certain of  its  recitals.  Per  recital  (4),
    Dublin III is designed to operate as "a clear and workable  method  for
    determining the Member State responsible  for  the  examination  of  an
    asylum application".  Recital (5) states that the mechanisms devised  -




         "...  should, in particular, make it possible to determine  rapidly
         the Member State responsible, so as to guarantee  effective  access
         to the procedures for granting international protection and not  to
         compromise the objective of the rapid  processing  of  applications
         for international protection."




    By recital (13):


         "In accordance with the  1989  United  Nations  Convention  on  the
         Rights of the Child and with the Charter of Fundamental  Rights  of
         the European Union, the best interests of the  child  should  be  a
         primary  consideration  of  Member  States   when   applying   this
         Regulation.  In assessing the best interests of the  child,  Member
         States should, in particular,  take  due  account  of  the  minor's
         wellbeing   and   social   development,   safety    and    security
         considerations and the views of the minor in accordance with his or
         her age and maturity, including his or her background."




    Recital (14) states:


         "In accordance with the European Convention for the  Protection  of
         Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms  and  with  the  Charter  of
         Fundamental Rights of the European Union, respect for  family  life
         should be a primary consideration of Member  States  when  applying
         this Regulation."




[2]   Recital (16) states, in part:


         "When the applicant is an unaccompanied minor, the  presence  of  a
         family member or relative on the territory of another Member  State
         who can take care of him  or  her  should  also  become  a  binding
         responsibility criterion."




    Recital (17) is directly linked to Article 17:


         "Any  Member  State  should  be   able   to   derogate   from   the
         responsibility  criteria,  in  particular   on   humanitarian   and
         compassionate grounds, in order to bring together  family  members,
         relatives or any other family relations and examine an  application
         for international protection lodged with it or with another  Member
         State, even if such examination is not its responsibility under the
         binding criteria laid down in this Regulation."


      We note also Recital (18):


         "A personal interview with the applicant  should  be  organised  in
         order  to  facilitate  the  determination  of  the   Member   State
         responsible  for  examining  an   application   for   international
         protection."




[3]   Turning to the Regulation  proper,  it  is  important  to  absorb  the
    definition of "unaccompanied minor":


         "A  minor  who  arrives  on  the  territory  of  the  Member  State
         unaccompanied by an adult responsible for him or  her,  whether  by
         law or by the practice of the Member State concerned,  and  for  as
         long as he or she is not effectively taken into the care of such an
         adult ...."




[4]   There are  certain  other  provisions  of  the  Dublin  Regulation  of
    significance in the present context:


    Article 3(1)

         "Member States shall  examine  any  application  for  international
         protection by a third-country national or a  stateless  person  who
         applies on the territory of any  one  of  them,  including  at  the
         border or in the transit zones.  The application shall be  examined
         by a single Member State, which shall be the one which the criteria
         set out in Chapter III indicate is responsible."

    Article 5

         "1.      In order to facilitate  the  process  of  determining  the
             Member State responsible, the determining Member  State  shall
             conduct a personal interview with the applicant. The interview
             shall also allow the proper understanding of  the  information
             supplied to the applicant in accordance with Article 4.


         2. The personal interview may be omitted if:

             (a) the applicant has absconded; or


             (b) after having  received  the  information  referred  to  in
                  Article  4,  the  applicant  has  already   provided   the
                  information  relevant  to  determine  the   Member   State
                  responsible by other means.  The Member State omitting the
                  interview shall give  the  applicant  the  opportunity  to
                  present all  further  information  which  is  relevant  to
                  correctly determine the Member State responsible before  a
                  decision is taken to transfer the applicant to the  Member
                  State responsible pursuant to Article 26(1).

         3. The personal interview shall take place in a timely manner  and,
             in any event, before any decision is  taken  to  transfer  the
             applicant to the Member State responsible pursuant to  Article
             26(1).


         4  The personal interview shall be conducted in a language that the
             applicant understands or is reasonably supposed to  understand
             and in  which  he  or  she  is  able  to  communicate.   Where
             necessary, Member States shall have recourse to an interpreter
             who is able to ensure appropriate  communication  between  the
             applicant and the person conducting the personal interview.


         5. The personal interview shall take place under  conditions  which
             ensure appropriate confidentiality.  It shall be conducted  by
             a qualified person under national law.


         6. The Member State conducting the personal interview shall make  a
             written summary thereof which shall contain at least the  main
             information supplied by the applicant at the interview.   This
             summary may either take the form of a  report  or  a  standard
             form.  The Member State shall ensure that the applicant and/or
             the legal advisor or other counsellor who is representing  the
             applicant have timely access to the summary."

    Article 6


    This prescribes a series of guarantees for children, in  the  following
    terms:


         "(ii)    The best  interests  of  the  child  shall  be  a  primary
             consideration for Member States with respect to all procedures
             provided for in this Regulation.


         (iv)     For the purpose of applying Article 8,  the  Member  State
             where  the  unaccompanied  minor  lodged  an  application  for
             international protection shall,  as  soon  as  possible,  take
             appropriate action to identify the family members, siblings or
             relatives of the  unaccompanied  minor  on  the  territory  of
             Member States, whilst protecting the  best  interests  of  the
             child.  To that end,  that  Member  State  may  call  for  the
             assistance of international or other  relevant  organisations,
             and may facilitate the minor's access to the tracing  services
             of such organisations."


    Article 8

         "1.      Where the applicant is an unaccompanied minor, the  Member
             State responsible shall be that where a  family  member  or  a
             sibling  of  the  unaccompanied  minor  is  legally   present,
             provided that it is in the best interests of the minor.  Where
             the applicant is a married minor whose spouse is  not  legally
             present on the territory of  the  Member  States,  the  Member
             State responsible shall be the Member State where the  father,
             mother or other adult responsible for the  minor,  whether  by
             law or by the practice of that Member  State,  or  sibling  is
             legally present.


         2. Where the applicant is an unaccompanied minor who has a relative
             who is legally present in another Member State and where it is
             established, based on  an  individual  examination,  that  the
             relative can take care of him or her, that Member State  shall
             unite the minor with his or her  relative  and  shall  be  the
             Member State responsible, provided that  it  is  in  the  best
             interests of the minor.


         3. Where family members, siblings or relatives as  referred  to  in
             paragraphs 1 and 2, stay in more than one  Member  State,  the
             Member State responsible shall be decided on the basis of what
             is in the best interests of the unaccompanied minor.


         4. In the absence of a family member, a sibling or  a  relative  as
             referred  to  in  paragraphs  1  and  2,  the   Member   State
             responsible shall be that where the  unaccompanied  minor  has
             lodged his or her application  for  international  protection,
             provided that it is in the best interests of the minor.


         5. The Commission shall be empowered to  adopt  delegated  acts  in
             accordance with Article 45 concerning  the  identification  of
             family members, siblings or  relatives  of  the  unaccompanied
             minor; the criteria for establishing the existence  of  proven
             family links; the criteria for assessing  the  capacity  of  a
             relative to take care of the  unaccompanied  minor,  including
             where  family  members,   siblings   or   relatives   of   the
             unaccompanied minor stay in more than one  Member  State.   In
             exercising its powers to adopt delegated acts, the  Commission
             shall not exceed the scope of the best interests of the  child
             as provided for under Article 6(3).


         6. The Commission shall, by means of implementing  acts,  establish
             uniform conditions for the consultation and  the  exchange  of
             information between Member  States.  Those  implementing  acts
             shall be adopted in accordance with the examination  procedure
             referred to in Article 44(2)."



    Article 17

         "1.      By way of derogation from Article 3(1), each Member  State
             may  decide  to  examine  an  application  for   international
             protection lodged with it by a  third-country  national  or  a
             stateless  person,  even  if  such  examination  is  not   its
             responsibility  under  the  criteria   laid   down   in   this
             Regulation.

             The Member State which decides to examine an  application  for
             international protection  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall
             become the Member  State  responsible  and  shall  assume  the
             obligations  associated  with  that   responsibility.    Where
             applicable, it shall inform, using the  'DubliNet'  electronic
             communication network set up under Article  18  of  Regulation

             requested to take charge of, or to take back, the applicant.


             The Member State which becomes responsible  pursuant  to  this
             paragraph shall forthwith indicate it in Eurodac in accordance
             with Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 by adding the date  when  the
             decision to examine the application was taken.


         2. The Member State  in  which  an  application  for  international
             protection is made and which is carrying out  the  process  of
             determining the Member State responsible, or the Member  State
             responsible,  may,  at  any  time  before  a  first   decision
             regarding the substance is taken, request another Member State
             to take charge of an applicant in order to bring together  any
             family relations, on humanitarian grounds based in  particular
             on family or cultural considerations, even  where  that  other
             Member State is not responsible under the criteria  laid  down
             in Articles 8 to  11  and  16.   The  persons  concerned  must
             express their consent in writing


             The request to take charge shall contain all the  material  in
             the possession of the requesting Member  State  to  allow  the
             requested Member State to assess the situation.

             The requested Member  State  shall  carry  out  any  necessary
             checks to examine the humanitarian grounds  cited,  and  shall
             reply to the requesting Member  State  within  two  months  of
             receipt  of  the  request  using  the  'DubliNet'   electronic
             communication network set up under Article  18  of  Regulation
             (EC) No 1560/2003. A reply refusing the  request  shall  state
             the reasons on which the refusal is based.

             Where  the  requested  Member  State  accepts   the   request,
             responsibility  for  examining  the   application   shall   be
             transferred to it. "

    Article 18(1)(a)

         "The Member  State  responsible  under  this  Regulation  shall  be
         obliged to:

         (a)      take charge, under the conditions laid  down  in  Articles
             21, 22 and 29, of an applicant who has lodged  an  application
             in a different Member State . . ."



    Article 21


         "1.      Where  a  Member  State  with  which  an  application  for
             international  protection  has  been  lodged  considers   that
             another  Member  State  is  responsible  for   examining   the
             application, it may, as quickly as possible and in  any  event
             within three months of the date on which the  application  was
             lodged within the meaning of Article 20(2), request that other
             Member State to take charge of the applicant.

             Notwithstanding the first  subparagraph,  in  the  case  of  a
             Eurodac hit with data  recorded  pursuant  to  Article  14  of
             Regulation (EU) No 603/2013, the request shall be sent  within
             two months of receiving that hit pursuant to Article 15(2)  of
             that Regulation.

             Where the request to take charge of an applicant is  not  made
             within  the  periods  laid  down  in  the  first  and   second
             subparagraphs, responsibility for  examining  the  application
             for international protection shall lie with the  Member  State
             in which the application was lodged.


         2. The requesting Member State may ask for an urgent reply in cases
             where the application for international protection was  lodged
             after leave to enter or remain was refused,  after  an  arrest
             for an unlawful stay or after the service or  execution  of  a
             removal order.

             The request shall state the reasons warranting an urgent reply
             and the period within which


         3. In the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the request that
             charge be taken by another Member State shall be made using  a
             standard form and including proof or  circumstantial  evidence
             as described in the  two  lists  mentioned  in  Article  22(3)
             and/or  relevant  elements  from  the  applicant's  statement,
             enabling the authorities of  the  requested  Member  State  to
             check whether it is responsible on the basis of  the  criteria
             laid down in this Regulation.

             The Commission shall, by means  of  implementing  acts,  adopt
             uniform conditions on the preparation and submission  of  take
             charge requests.  Those implementing acts shall be adopted  in
             accordance with  the  examination  procedure  referred  to  in
             Article 44(2)."


    Article 22

         "1.      The  requested  Member  State  shall  make  the  necessary
             checks, and shall give a  decision  on  the  request  to  take
             charge of an applicant within two months  of  receipt  of  the
             request.


         2. In the procedure for determining the  Member  State  responsible
             elements of proof and circumstantial evidence shall be used.


         3. The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts,  establish,
             and review periodically, two lists,  indicating  the  relevant
             elements of proof and circumstantial  evidence  in  accordance
             with the criteria set out  in  points  (a)  and  (b)  of  this
             paragraph.  Those  implementing  acts  shall  be  adopted   in
             accordance with  the  examination  procedure  referred  to  in
             Article 44(2).

             (a) Proof:


                  (i)    this  refers  to  formal  proof  which   determines
                      responsibility pursuant to this Regulation,  as  long
                      as it is not refuted by proof to the contrary;


                  (ii)   the  Member  States  shall  provide  the  Committee
                      provided  for  in  Article  44  with  models  of  the
                      different  types  of  administrative  documents,   in
                      accordance with the typology established in the  list
                      of formal proofs;


             (b)  Circumstantial evidence:

                  (i)   this refers to indicative elements which while being
                      refutable  may  be  sufficient,  in  certain   cases,
                      according to  the  evidentiary  value  attributed  to
                      them;


                  (ii)   their  evidentiary  value,  in  relation   to   the
                      responsibility  for  examining  the  application  for
                      international protection shall be assessed on a case-
                      by-case basis.


         4. The requirement of proof should not exceed what is necessary for
             the proper application of this Regulation.


         5. If there is no formal proof, the requested  Member  State  shall
             acknowledge its responsibility if the circumstantial  evidence
             is coherent, verifiable and sufficiently detailed to establish
             responsibility.


         6. Where  the  requesting  Member  State  has  pleaded  urgency  in
             accordance with the provisions of Article 21(2), the requested
             Member State shall make every effort to comply with  the  time
             limit  requested.  In  exceptional  cases,  where  it  can  be
             demonstrated that the examination  of  a  request  for  taking
             charge of an applicant is particularly complex, the  requested
             Member  State  may  give  its  reply  after  the  time   limit
             requested, but  in  any  event  within  one  month.   In  such
             situations the requested Member  State  must  communicate  its
             decision to postpone a reply to the  requesting  Member  State
             within the time limit originally requested.


         7.  Failure  to  act  within  the  two-month  period  mentioned  in
             paragraph 1 and the one-month period mentioned in paragraph  6
             shall be tantamount to accepting the request, and  entail  the
             obligation  to  take  charge  of  the  person,  including  the
             obligation to provide for proper arrangements for arrival."


    Article 29

         "1.      The transfer of the applicant  or  of  another  person  as
             referred to in Article 18(1)(c) or  (d)  from  the  requesting
             Member State to the Member State responsible shall be  carried
             out in accordance with the  national  law  of  the  requesting
             Member State, after consultation  between  the  Member  States
             concerned, as soon as practically possible, and at the  latest
             within six months of acceptance  of  the  request  by  another
             Member State to  take  charge  or  to  take  back  the  person
             concerned or of the final decision  on  an  appeal  or  review
             where there is a suspensive effect in accordance with  Article
             27(3).

             If transfers to the Member State responsible are  carried  out
             by supervised departure or under escort, Member  States  shall
             ensure that they are carried out in a humane manner  and  with
             full respect for fundamental rights and human dignity.


             If  necessary,  the  applicant  shall  be  supplied   by   the
             requesting Member State with a laissez passer. The  Commission
             shall, by means of implementing acts, establish the design  of
             the laissez passer. Those implementing acts shall  be  adopted
             in accordance with the examination procedure  referred  to  in
             Article 44(2).

             The Member  State  responsible  shall  inform  the  requesting
             Member State, as appropriate,  of  the  safe  arrival  of  the
             person concerned or of the fact that he or she did not  appear
             within the set time limit.


         2. Where the transfer does not take place within  the  six  months'
             time limit, the Member State responsible shall be relieved  of
             its obligations to take charge or  to  take  back  the  person
             concerned and responsibility shall then be transferred to  the
             requesting Member State.  This time limit may be  extended  up
             to a maximum of one year if the transfer could not be  carried
             out due to imprisonment of the person concerned  or  up  to  a
             maximum of eighteen months if the person concerned absconds.


         3. If a person has been transferred erroneously or  a  decision  to
             transfer is overturned on appeal or review after the  transfer
             has been carried out, the Member State which carried  out  the
             transfer shall promptly accept that person back.


         4.       The Commission  shall,  by  means  of  implementing  acts,
             establish uniform conditions for the consultation and exchange
             of information between Member States,  in  particular  in  the
             event of postponed or delayed transfers,  transfers  following
             acceptance  by  default,  transfers  of  minors  or  dependent
             persons, and supervised transfers.   Those  implementing  acts
             shall be adopted in accordance with the examination  procedure
             referred to in Article 44(2)."



[5]   The salient provisions of Commission Regulation 1560/2003, bearing  in
    mind the present litigation context, are contained in, firstly, Article
    12:

         "1.      Where the decision to entrust the care of an unaccompanied
             minor to a relative other than the  mother,  father  or  legal
             guardian  is  likely   to   cause   particular   difficulties,
             particularly where the adult  concerned  resides  outside  the
             jurisdiction of the  Member  State  in  which  the  minor  has
             applied  for  asylum,  cooperation   between   the   competent
             authorities  in  the  Member   States,   in   particular   the
             authorities  or  courts  responsible  for  the  protection  of
             minors, shall be facilitated and the necessary steps taken  to
             ensure that those authorities can decide, with full  knowledge
             of the facts, on the ability of the adult or adults  concerned
             to take charge of the minor in a way  which  serves  his  best
             interests


             Options now available in the field of cooperation on  judicial
             and  civil  matters  shall  be  taken  account  of   in   this
             connection.


         2. The fact that the duration of procedures for placing a minor may
             lead to a failure to observe the time limits  set  in  Article
             18(1) and (6) and Article 19(4) of Regulation (EC) No 343/2003
             shall  not  necessarily  be  an  obstacle  to  continuing  the
             procedure for determining  the  Member  State  responsible  or
             carrying out a transfer."



[6]   This is supplemented by a series of provisions,  which  include  those
    in Annex II detailing various  methods  of  proving  the  existence  of
    family members and, in other  Annexes,  prescribing  the  forms  to  be
    employed for requests for information and take charge requests.
