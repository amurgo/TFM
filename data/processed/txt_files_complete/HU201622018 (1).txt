For the Appellant:
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 26 July 2019 of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Sweet which allowed the appellant's appeal  against
    the refusal of entry clearance as a spouse.

 2. The appellant is a citizen  of  Ghana,  born  on  6  April  1972.   Her
    daughter, Emanuella, born on 16 August 2011, is her dependant  in  this
    matter.

 3. The appellant and her UK sponsor, Mr Alex Ankomah, were married in  the
    UK in 2001.  They have three children together.  While Ms  Ankomah  was
    working abroad as a diplomatic officer  for  the  Ghanaian  government,
    Emanuella lived with her and the two older children  lived  with  their
    father in the UK.

 4. On 18 May 2018 the appellant applied for entry clearance  as  a  spouse
    with her daughter as her dependant.  The application was refused on  20
    August 2018.  The decision found that the appellant could  not  meet  a
    number of the provisions of the Immigration Rules.

 5. Firstly, the respondent found that appellant  had  not  provided  valid
    medical certificates showing that she and her  daughter  had  undergone
    screening for tuberculosis and did not have the disease.

 6. Secondly, although it was accepted that the appellant had a degree from
    University of Ghana, she did not provide  a  UK  NARIC  certificate  to
    demonstrate that this had been taught in English.

 7. Thirdly, the respondent found that the  sponsor's  financial  documents
    did not meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE. He had to show that he
    had a gross income of at least �22,400 in order to support his wife and
    daughter. In order to do  so,  he  relied  on  his  employment  at  the
    Greenwich School of Management  (GSM)  and  at  Tesco  supermarket.  In
    relation to those employments, the  sponsor  had  to  comply  with  the
    following requirements of Appendix FM-SE set out in paragraph A1(2):

         2. In respect of  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:

          a) Payslips covering:




               i) a period of six months prior to the date of application if
                  the person has been employed by their current employer for
                  at least six months (and where  paragraph  13(b)  of  this
                  Appendix does not apply): or




              ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of  twelve
                  months prior to the date of application if the person  has
                  been employed by their current employer for less than  six
                  months (or at least six months but  the  person  does  not
                  rely on paragraph 13(a)  of  this  Appendix),  or  in  the
                  financial year(s) relied on by a self-employed person.




          b) A letter from the  employer(s)  who  issued  the  payslips  at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming:




               i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;




              ii) the length of their employment;


             iii) the period over which they have  been  or  were  paid  the
                  level of salary relied upon in the application: and


              iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed term contract  or
                  agency).




          c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the  same  period(s)
             as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has
             been paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.




 8. The respondent found that these requirements were not met. The  sponsor
    had not provided a wage slip for the Tesco employment for May 2018. The
    sponsor's NatWest bank statements showed  payments  in  line  with  the
    Tesco pay slips provided but did not cover May 2018. Further, there was
    no employer's letter as required by paragraph 2 (b).




 9. Also, the sponsor had not provided wage slips  from  GSM  for  January,
    February and March 2018. The Santander bank statements showing payments
    from GSM covered the periods July 2016 to May 2017 and January 2018  to
    March 2018 and so did not cover the last six month period prior to  the
    application. There was no employer's letter from GSM.

10. The appellant appealed against the decision on 2 October 2018 and on 22
    January 2019 the Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) reviewed the case.   The
    Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) considered the  additional  documentation
    that had been provided by then but  was  satisfied  that  the  original
    decision to refuse was correct. The appellant had supplied tuberculosis
    certificates but not in the required format.  The absence  of  a  NARIC
    certificate had not been remedied. Regarding the  financial  documents,
    the requisite payslips from Tesco had been provided but  there  was  no
    bank statement showing the salary deposit for 6  April  2018.  Payslips
    from GSM for January, February and March 2018 were  still  missing.   A
    job offer dated 1 March 2016 from GSM has been submitted  but  did  not
    meet the requirements of paragraph  2(b)  and  there  was  no  employer
    letter from Tesco.

11. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet on 17 July 2019.
     At that hearing the appellant's sponsor attended to present  her  case
    and there was no representation for the respondent.   The  judge  noted
    that on 1 May 2019 the appellant had provided further  evidence  beyond
    that provided in support of the original application and  to  the  ECM.
    The  judge  found  that  the  appellant  had  provided  the   requisite
    tuberculosis certificate and UK NARIC certificate. The  respondent  did
    not seek to dispute those findings before us.

12. The First-tier Tribunal also indicated in paragraph 3 of  the  decision
    that the appellant had provided NatWest bank statements in  respect  of
    earnings from Tesco and payslips from January and March 2018 from GSM.

13. The judge made the following findings in paragraphs 14 and 15:

         "14. Having considered the documentation  now  provided,  including
             the oral evidence of the appellant's sponsor, I  am  satisfied
             that he does meet the financial requirements, as his  combined
             annual earnings  from  his  two  employers  are  approximately
             �40,000.  These  figures  exceeded  the  necessary  figure  of
             �18,600 and �3,800 required under the Immigration Rules.  I am
             also persuaded that the appellant (and her daughter)  has  met
             the  TB  screening  requirements  and,  as  her  degrees  were
             conducted  in  the  English  language,  the  English  language
             requirements.

         15.  If I concluded that the appellant had not met the requirements
             of the Immigration Rules, I would have allowed  this  GEN.3.1.
             and GEN.3.2. of Appendix FM  in  respect  of  the  exceptional
             circumstances pertaining under Article 8 ECHR,  because  there
             are clearly very harsh consequences for the family not  to  be
             able to live together."

    The judge went on to allow the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

14.  The  respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  and  was   granted
    permission to appeal by the First-tier Tribunal  on  23  October  2019.
    The grounds maintained that the decision  failed  to  provide  adequate
    reasons for finding that the sponsor had met the provisions of Appendix
    FM-SE. There was also  no  reasoning  explaining  how  there  could  be
    unjustifiably harsh consequences  capable  of  outweighing  the  public
    interest if the Immigration Rules were not met.

15. We found that the respondent's grounds had  merit.  That  was  so  even
    where Mr Whitwell conceded that the sponsor had provided the First-tier
    Tribunal with the required payslips and bank  statements  covering  his
    Tesco employment and for the GSM employment other than the payslip  for
    February 2018 (for which there was no payslip as  Mr  Ankomah  did  not
    work, and so was not paid, every month).

16. We found nothing in the materials that had been before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal showing that the sponsor had provided  a  letter  from  either
    employer that met the requirements of paragraph 2(b). The letter  dated
    1 March 2016 from GSM was a job offer and did not refer to  the  length
    of employment or the period over which the sponsor had  been  paid  the
    level of salary relied upon in the application.  There  was  no  letter
    from Tesco before the First-tier Tribunal. The decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal only states that  the  judge  was  "satisfied"  that  the
    financial requirements were met without any detail or clarity as to how
    that could have been so.

17. We were also unable to identify anything that was capable of supporting
    the finding of the First-tier Tribunal as to there being  unjustifiably
    harsh circumstances if entry clearance was not  granted.  The  decision
    does not refer to any specific matters that might do so and  there  was
    nothing the materials capable of doing so.

18. It was therefore our conclusion  that  the  decision  did  not  provide
    adequate reasons explaining how the judge reached  the  conclusions  he
    did. We found that these matters amounted to  a  material  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision had to be set aside to be remade.

19. After canvassing the views of the parties, we reserved the decision re-
    making the appeal until after  the  appellant  had  been  afforded  the
    opportunity to provide the employer's letters complying with  paragraph
    2(b). She was also directed to explain the missing pay  slip  from  GSM
    for February 2018. The respondent was to be afforded the opportunity to
    comment on the appellant's additional materials.

20. The appellant provided a new bundle of materials  comprising  28  pages
    under cover of an email dated 15 January 2021. The respondent  did  not
    respond to the direction to comment on those materials  by  8  February
    2021.

21. The appellant's further materials did not include  an  employer  letter
    from either GSM  or  Tesco  capable  of  meeting  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 2(b). The appellant continues to rely on  a  letter  dated  1
    March 2016 from GSM which was  provided  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing which as we have noted above is only a job offer and  does  not
    set out the information required by Appendix FM-SE. The letter does not
    identify the length of the sponsor's employment or refer to the  period
    over which the sponsor was paid as relied on in the  application.   The
    sponsor has provided a letter from Tesco dated 31  May  2016  which  is
    also a job offer and does  not  set  out  the  sponsor's  gross  annual
    salary, the length of his employment or identify the salary  paid  over
    the period relied on in the application. This information is  also  not
    included in the statements of Terms and Conditions of  Employment  that
    the sponsor has provided for each employment.

22. We found that the requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not shown to have
    been met at any material time, therefore. This is not a case where  the
    appellant has shown that if she were to apply now that the  Immigration
    Rules would be met and so that that factor may be weighed positively in
    the Article  8  ECHR  proportionality  assessment.  The  new  materials
    contained nothing showing anything that could approach the threshold of
    unjustifiably harsh consequences if entry clearance was not granted  or
    that the decision to refuse entry clearance  could  be  said  to  be  a
    disproportionate breach of Article 8 ECHR.

23. For these reasons, we found that the Article 8 ECHR appeal  had  to  be
    dismissed.

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error of  law  and
    is set aside to be remade.

25. We remake the appeal under Article 8 ECHR as dismissed.
