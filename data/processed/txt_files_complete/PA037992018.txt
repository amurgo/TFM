For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines, aged 37.  FtT Judge P  A
    Grant-Hutchison dismissed his appeal by a decision  promulgated  on  17
    September 2018.

 2. The Vice President of  the  UT  granted  permission  to  appeal  on  19
    September 2019, in light of a joint minute entered into by the  parties
    in the Court of Session, and of the Court's interlocutor.

 3. Mr Govan accepted that ground  1,  on  risk  from  the  family  of  the
    appellant's ex-wife, and ground 2, on risk arising from involvement  in
    drugs, both disclosed error.  He said that  there  was  less  merit  in
    ground 3, on bisexuality, and ground 4, on a psychological report,  but
    that, as a whole, the grounds required the decision to be remade.

 4. The following outcome was agreed.

 5. The decision of the FtT is set aside, other than as a  record  of  what
    took place at the hearing.

 6. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 7. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Grant-Hutchison.

 8. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  The matter was not  addressed  in
    the UT.  Anonymity is preserved at this stage.
