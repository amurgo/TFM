Representation:
For the Appellant:     Not represented
For the Respondent:    Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of the  First  tier
    Tribunal (Judge Phull) dated 5 May 2015. In  this  decision,  we  shall
    refer to the parties as they were in the First tier, ie that Mr Ran Tao
    is the Appellant, and the Secretary of State for the Home Department is
    the Respondent.

 2. The Appellant, a national of China, had appealed to the FtT against the
    Respondent's decision of 17 December 2014 refusing to vary his leave to
    remain, and making a decision to  remove  him  under  s.47  Immigration
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The Appellant had previous  leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 student from 16 February  2012  to
    27 October 2014. He had been studying  for  a  BA  (Hons)  in  Business
    Management at Anglia Ruskin University. He achieved his  degree,  which
    was awarded to him on 22 August 2014.

 3. He wished to apply for further leave to remain to pursue an MA in Human
    Resource Management at Coventry University from 22 September 2014 to 30
    September 2015.

 4. He made an on line application on 1 October 2014. There was no  dispute
    before us that where the online application was submitted on 1  October
    2014 this was the formal date of application as  defined  by  paragraph
    34G (iv) of the Immigration Rules.

 5. On 9 October the Respondent wrote to the Appellant asserting  that  the
    following  mandatory  documents  had  not  been   provided   with   his
    application: photographs; evidence of identity - BRP; and  evidence  of
    nationality - passport/travel document.

 6. According to the Appellant's subsequent grounds of appeal to  the  FtT,
    the Appellant posted  his  documentation  in  support  of  his  on-line
    application, to the Respondent on 15 October 2014. There is a  copy  of
    an envelope towards the rear of the Respondent's  (unpaginated)  bundle
    showing a date stamp of 15 October 2014. In his grounds of appeal,  the
    Appellant asserts that the bank statements  that  he  provided  in  his
    documentation included HSBC statements from 17  September  2014  to  14
    October 2014, ie a consecutive 28 day period.

 7. Within the Respondent's bundle are HSBC  statements,  apparently  (from
    the date at the bottom right of each page) printed on 14 October  2014,
    covering the whole of the period 18 June 2014 to 14 October  2014.  The
    balance was over �1640 for the whole of that period, save for one  day,
    on 16 September 2014, when the balance was  �404.19.  The  balance  the
    next day, 17 September 2014, was �10,304.19.

The Respondent's decision

 8. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for leave to  remain
    under Immigration Rule 245ZX and  Appendix  C  of  the  Rules,  on  the
    grounds  that  the  Appellant  was  not  entitled  to  any  points  for
    Maintenance. This was because, it was asserted:

         ".   You are required to show living costs of �1,640.00  plus  your
             outstanding course fees of �0.00 as stated on  your  CAS.  You
             are therefore required to show that you are in  possession  of
             �1,640 for a consecutive 28 day period  to  meet  the  Tier  4
             (general) Student maintenance requirements.

         .    As the closing balance of  the  bank  statement  submitted  in
             support of your application is dated 1 October 2014, you  need
             to show evidence of maintenance for 28 days from  4  September
             to 1 October 2014. However, on 16  September  2014,  the  bank
             statements you have submitted  shows  a  balance  of  �404.19,
             which does not demonstrate that the required level of funds is
             available to you."

 9. The Appellant appealed against the Respondent's decision, pointing  out
    in his grounds of appeal that he had provided, with the material posted
    on 15 October, bank statements covering  the  28  day  period  from  17
    September to  14  October,  and  asserting  (twice)  that  he  did  not
    understand why the Caseworker counts from 1 October, the date of filing
    the on line form.  With his  notice  of  appeal,  the  Appellant  filed
    further bank statements, for the period 18 November 2014 to 24 December
    2014, but these documents are not material.

The First tier decision

10. The Appellant requested an appeal  on  the  papers.  This  appeal  came
    before the Judge on 23 March 2015. The Judge noted at [5] the  evidence
    submitted by the Appellant in support of his application, and noted  at
    [6]  the  Respondent's  request  of  9   October   2014   for   further
    documentation, but observed that:

         "The  respondent  does  not  request  any  evidence  of   financial
         documents for 28-days prior to 1 October 2014  to  show  consistent
         funds of �1640 in the  account  from  the  4  September  to  the  1
         October."

11. The Judge held that the Respondent  had  not  applied  the  common  law
    principles of fairness in the case, with reference to Naved (Student  -
    fairness - notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14 (IAC) [7];  repeating  that
    finding at [9], and further stating:

         "... given that he has consistently held money in his bank  account
         over and above the maintenance requirements for Tier  4  except  on
         the one occasion relied  upon  by  the  respondent  to  refuse  his
         application.

         ...

         11. The respondent also has discretion  to  consider  the  date  of
         application, as the  date  on  which  it  receives  documents  from
         applicants. The refusal does not indicate that any such  discretion
         was applied in the appellant's case."

         12. For all these reasons I find on balance that  the  respondent's
         decision is unlawful and not in accordance with  the  law  and  the
         appellant now awaits a lawful decision."

12. The decision then indicates at [13] that it was allowed.

Secretary of State's Appeal

13. The Respondent sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in  an
    application dated 8 May 2015 on  grounds,  in  summary,  that  the  FtT
    materially erred in law in:

          i) failing to identify what discretion the  Judge  was  referring
             to, (and denying that there had been an  unlawful  failure  to
             exercise discretion);

         ii) appearing to apply a 'near miss' test to the  appeal,  whereas
             the Appellant  failed  to  satisfy  the  relevant  maintenance
             requirements.

14. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Judge  of  First  tier  Tribunal
    Shimmin on 25 June 2015. The matter now comes before us.

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal

15. There was no appearance by or  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant.  On  the
    Tribunal file, there is  a  copy  of  an  email,  apparently  from  the
    Appellant dated 20 July 2015 addressed to IAC Customer Service in  that
    he would like to withdraw his appeal and return back to China. He  gave
    details of a proposed flight on 25 July 2015. There is  a  copy  of  an
    email from Grahame Tomlinson, Correspondence Team at Field House  dated
    21 July 2015 to the Appellant indicating that as the appeal before  the
    Upper Tribunal was brought by the Secretary of State,  it  was  not  Mr
    Tao's appeal to withdraw. He suggested that if Mr Tao  wished  for  his
    appeal to be treated  as  abandoned,  he  would  need  to  contact  the
    Secretary of State directly to ask them to abandon their appeal.

16. There was nothing more before us to indicate  that  the  applicant  had
    left the country such that the appeal might be  treated  as  abandoned.
    There was nothing to indicate that the appellant  did  not  oppose  the
    Secretary of State's appeal. There was also nothing further  explaining
    his non-appearance and having found good service had  taken  place,  we
    proceeded to hear the appeal and heard from Mr Smart who relied on  the
    written grounds of appeal.

Error of Law

17. We agree with the Respondent that the Judge erred in  law  at  [10]  in
    finding that  the  Respondent  had  failed  to  apply  the  common  law
    principles of fairness.

18. Although Mr Smart referred to EK (Ivory Coast), the Court of Appeal did
    not in that judgment disapprove the principle  that  the  Secretary  of
    State in the exercising her functions was under a  general  public  law
    duty to act fairly; rather it held that in the particular facts of that
    case there had been no  unfairness  to  the  appellant  caused  by  the
    Secretary of State. Further, the Court held at [42] that  nothing  said
    in the judgment itself in Naved (as distinct from the headnote  summary
    of it) was inconsistent with the Court's own conclusions in  EK  (Ivory
    Coast). The unfairness to the appellant Naved was described as follows:

         "42 ... The Home Office bore  substantial  responsibility  for  the
         error which occurred. Without warning to  the  applicant,  it  went
         behind the information given by him  about  his  course  with  LCR,
         received a confusing response to its inquiry  which  it  failed  to
         read properly or check, and then failed to give  the  applicant  an
         opportunity to adduce  documentary  evidence  of  a  standard  type
         (certificate of completion  of  the  course  etc)  to  resolve  the
         dispute which appeared to have emerged about  the  history  of  his
         relations with LCR."

19. The Court of Appeal did find, however, that if the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Naved had intended to lay down a principle of law as formulated in  its
    headnote:  "Fairness  requires  the  Secretary  of  State  to  give  an
    applicant an opportunity to address grounds for refusal,  of  which  he
    did not know and could not have  known,  failing  which  the  resulting
    decision may be set aside on appeal as contrary to law ...", the  Court
    could not agree with such a proposition, on the grounds inter alia [40]
    that it left out of account the highly modulated and fact-sensitive way
    in which the general public law duty of fairness operates.

20. However, aside from the guidance now provided by the Court of Appeal as
    to the meaning and effect of Naved, we find that the Judge erred  in  a
    more fundamental way, in not setting out what  the  unfairness  to  the
    Appellant was, how it had come about, or in what way the Respondent had
    acted unfairly and therefore unlawfully.

21. Further, in relation to the Judge's finding at [11] that the Respondent
    has a discretion to consider the date of application as being the  date
    on which the Respondent received the documents submitted in support  of
    the application (and that the Respondent erred in  law  in  failing  to
    exercise that discretion) we find that there  is  no  such  discretion;
    paragraph 34G of the Immigration Rules makes explicit the date on which
    an application is treated as being made; for  an  on-line  application,
    that is the date that the application was submitted on line,  which  in
    the present case was 1 October 2014.

Re-Making

22. We proceeded to re-make the appeal. We refused it on the basis that the
    financial requirements of paragraph 245ZX and Appendix C were not met.

23. Paragraph 1A of Appendix C to the Immigration Rules states:

         "1A. In all cases where an applicant is required to  obtain  points
         under Appendix C, the applicant must meet the  requirements  listed
         below:

               a) The  applicant  must  have  the  funds  specified  in  the
                  relevant  part  of  Appendix  C  at  the   date   of   the
                  application;

               b) If the applicant is applying as a Tier 1 Migrant, a Tier 2
                  Migrant or  a  Tier  5  (Temporary  Worker)  Migrant,  the
                  applicant must have had the funds referred to in (a) above
                  for a consecutive 90-day period of time,  unless  applying
                  as a Tier 1 (Exceptional  Talent)  Migrant  or  a  Tier  1
                  (Investor) Migrant;

               c) If the applicant is applying as  a  Tier  4  Migrant,  the
                  applicant must have had the funds referred to in (a) above
                  for a consecutive 28-day period of time;

             ...

             (h)  the end date of the 90-day and 28-day periods referred to
                  in (b) and (c) above will be taken  as  the  date  of  the
                  closing balance  on  the  most  recent  of  the  specified
                  documents (where specified  documents  from  two  or  more
                  accounts are submitted, this will be the end date for  the
                  account that most favours the applicant), and must  be  no
                  earlier than 31 days before the date of application."

24. We take from those provisions that the applicant was required  to  have
    funds of �1,640 for a 28 day period, that he must  have  had  them  for
    that 28 day period by the date of the application, here 1 October 2014,
    and that the end date of the 28 day period could be no earlier than  31
    days prior to 1 October 2014.

25. We find the requirement for the 28 day period to  have   ended  by  the
    date of application arises from the use of the words "must have had" in
    paragraph 1A(c), the pluperfect tense, referring to a time prior to the
    date of application.

26. The applicant here could not show funds for a 28 day period prior to  1
    October 2014 as he did not have �1,640 on 16 September 2014.

27. That being so, he did not qualify for 10  points  for  Maintenance  and
    could  not  meet   the  requirements  of  paragraph  245X(d)   of   the
    Immigration Rules.

28. The grounds of appeal did not raise Article 8.

29. We should point out that Mr Tao appears to have been  an  entirely  law
    abiding and very successful student  at  all  times,  the  only  matter
    preventing him from obtaining further leave being the fact of his funds
    going below the required level on 1 day. We obviously  do  not  dispute
    that this means that he was not entitled to further leave but it  would
    appear to be a matter unlikely, without  more,  to  carry  much  weight
    against him in the event of any  future  applications  to  come  to  or
    remain in the UK.

Notice of Decision

30. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shows an error on a  point
    of law and is set aside.

31. We re-make the appeal, refusing it under the Immigration Rules.
