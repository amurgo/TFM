                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Clarke promulgated 24.10.14, allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  to
    refuse his application for an EEA residence card based on a  derivative
    right to reside in the UK as the primary carer  of  a  British  citizen
    child.  The Judge heard the appeal on 6.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    9.12.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 3.2.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Clarke should be set aside.

 5. Judge Clarke found at �21 that on  the  basis  of  the  oral  evidence,
    finding the claimant and his fianc� credible, that if the claimant were
    to be removed from the UK the British citizen child  would  leave  with
    him.

 6. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  submit  that  the
    judge did not deal correctly with the requirements for a residence card
    set out in 15A and 18A of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  as
    amended. It is argued that the judge has misapplied the  definition  of
    'primary carer'  for  the  purpose  of  the  regulations.  It  is  also
    submitted that the judge should not have found that the child would  be
    unable to remain living in this country if the claimant  were  required
    to leave.

 7. It is clear that the judge has erred in law. The claimant's case at the
    time of the First-tier Tribunal hearing was that he and his fianc� were
    not living together but that they shared responsibility for caring  for
    their young child. It is obvious that the claimant  could  not  be  the
    person who has primary responsibility for the child's care as the child
    lived with the mother and the claimant did not and was in any event out
    at work for about 9 hours each day, during which  time  the  child  was
    looked after by his mother, a French national with a permanent right to
    reside, settled status, in the UK.  The  definition  of  primary  carer
    under regulation 15A(7) excludes a person sharing  equally  the  caring
    responsibility with one other  person  if  that  person  is  an  exempt
    person. It is clear, as Judge Clarke found at �5 of the  decision  that
    the mother is an exempt person. That was fatal to the application,  but
    rather oddly the judge decided to ignore that failure and  went  on  to
    consider the second hurdle, requiring the claimant to demonstrate  that
    if he were required to leave the child would unable to reside in the UK
    or another EEA State. Even if that second hurdle could be overcome, the
    claimant was not and could not  be  the  primary  carer  and  thus  his
    application for a derivative residence card was doomed to failure.

 8. In error Judge Clarke applied a different test to this  second  hurdle,
    concluding that if the claimant were removed the child would leave with
    him. At �12 the judge  recorded  the  mother's  evidence  that  if  the
    claimant had to leave it would be difficult for her to look  after  the
    child and she would rather that the child left with him. Setting  aside
    any incredulity one might have as to the veracity of this statement, it
    does not follow that the child would be forced to leave the UK. Even if
    it was her preference that he do so, is not the same  thing  as  saying
    that the child would be unable to remain  in  the  UK  or  another  EEA
    state. One also has to remember that the child is a British citizen and
    cannot in law be required to leave the UK, but also that the mother  is
    a citizen of France, which is an EEA state. Thus if the mother left the
    UK for France with her child, he would still be able to  reside  in  an
    EEA state. It is evident that Judge  Clarke  applied  the  wrong  legal
    test, but as stated above, once it is clear that the claimant cannot be
    the primary carer for the purpose of the regulation, the  appeal  could
    not succeed.

 9. It follows that the claimant's application was doomed to failure on the
    facts of this case. He neither met the primary carer definition nor was
    it show on any evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that  the  child
    would be forced to leave the UK if the claimant were required to leave.



10. Judge Clarke did not go on to consider  article  8  and  human  rights.
    Whilst article 8 was asserted in the letter of application and  grounds
    of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, there was no removal decision  in
    this case. The decision to refuse to grant the requested residence card
    does not change  the  status  quo  prevailing  immediately  before  the
    application. As  the  refusal  decision  explained,  the  claimant  had
    previously made a human rights claim to remain  which  was  refused  in
    2013 with no right of appeal. It also explained that there had been  no
    consideration of any private and family  life  claim  and  that  if  he
    wished to make such an application for leave to remain on those grounds
    he should make a separate, chargeable, application on the correct form.



11. It is a matter of some current legal debate as to whether the  Tribunal
    is required to consider a human rights claim at the same  time  an  EEA
    application. In AXA General Insurance Limited and  others  v  The  Lord
    Advocate [2011] UKSC 46, at �11 Lord Reed stated that, "where a  person
    is not at risk of violation of Convention  right  unless  and  until  a
    particular decision is taken, for example as to deportation, the person
    cannot claim to be a victim unless and until such a decision is in fact
    made." Removal is not imminent in this case and if and when  a  removal
    decision is made the appellant has an effective  remedy.  The  decision
    under appeal does not engage any rights under the European Convention.

12. Further, as there was no section 120 notice in this case, in line  with
    the cases of Lamichhane v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2012] EWCA Civ 260 and Jaff (s.120 notice;  statement  of  "additional
    grounds") [2012] UKUT 00396(IAC), in  the  absence  of  a  section  120
    notice, there is no jurisdiction  for  the  Tribunal  to  consider  any
    ground for the grant of leave to remain different from that  which  was
    the subject of the decision of the Secretary of State appealed against.
    An appellant on whom no section 120 notice  has  been  served  may  not
    raise before the Tribunal any ground for the grant of leave  to  remain
    different from that which was  the  subject  of  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State appealed against.

13. It follows that there was no basis for the Tribunal to consider article
    8.

14. It follows that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  cannot  stand
    and must be set aside and remade. However, it is clear that the  appeal
    cannot succeed on any basis.



Conclusion & Decision:

15. For the reasons set out herein, the making of the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on a point of law such
    that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
