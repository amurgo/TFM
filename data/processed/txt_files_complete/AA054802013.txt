Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr J Collins, instructed by Montague Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, ST, date of birth 5.5.77, is a citizen of Turkey.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bennett, dismissing her appeal against the decision of the  respondent,
    dated 17.5.13, to refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection and  human
    rights claims.  The Judge heard the appeal on 11.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pooler  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.9.14 but when the application was renewed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede granted permission to appeal on 9.1.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 9.4.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Bennett should be set aside.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Kebede noted that the  grounds,
    "make various assertions critical of the judge's consideration  of  the
    existing  country  guidance,   his   assessment   of   the   background
    information, his adverse credibility findings, his consideration of the
    medical evidence and his assessment of  risk  on  return,  as  well  as
    criticising him for including personal  comments  not  based  upon  the
    evidence before him. Given the length of the judge's determination  (73
    pages) and the lack of concise reasoning and arguable lack  of  clarity
    therein, the grounds merit further consideration and to that extent are
    arguable."

 7. The Rule  24  response,  dated  23.1.15,  submits  that  Judge  Bennett
    directed himself appropriately and that, "the grounds advanced raise no
    material arguable errors of law that would  be  considered  capable  of
    having a material impact upon the outcome of the appeal and are  merely
    an attempt by the appellant to re-argue (her) failed asylum appeal." It
    is further submitted that the judge properly  considered  the  evidence
    before the Tribunal and made reasonable sustainable findings  that  the
    appellant has failed to establish to the requisite  standard  of  proof
    that return to Turkey would expose her to a real  risk  of  persecution
    for a Convention reason, or a breach  of  her  humanitarian  protection
    rights, or a breach of her human rights. "Looking at the  determination
    holistically although it is a determination that is unorthodox in style
    and length, nevertheless the respondent will respectfully  submit  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge has produced a detailed and comprehensive
    determination which considers all material aspects of  the  appellant's
    claim and evidence and makes findings that are properly open to him  on
    the evidence and provides sound reasons to support those  findings.  As
    regards the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  findings  on  credibility  the
    respondent will submit that when assessing credibility it  is  for  the
    judge to determine what weight to place on the evidence before him  and
    it is submitted the adverse credibility  findings  made  were  properly
    open to him on that evidence. The lengthy grounds advanced are in  mere
    disagreement with the negative outcome of the appeal."

 8. Some of the grounds  are  rather  imprecise  and  generalised,  without
    identifying the particular error of law said to  infect  the  decision.
    Following Nixon (permission  to  appeal:  grounds)  [2014]  UKUT  00368
    (IAC), the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal can  be  expected
    to deal brusquely and robustly with any application for permission that
    does not specify clearly and coherently, with appropriate  particulars,
    the error(s) of law said to contaminate the decision  under  challenge.
    Besides placing unnecessary demands upon the judiciary, poorly compiled
    applications risk undermining the important value  of  legal  certainty
    and causing unfairness to the other party. Further, appeals should  not
    be mounted  on  the  basis  of  a  litany  of  forensic  criticisms  of
    particular findings of the First-tier  Tribunal,  whilst  ignoring  the
    basic  legal  test  which  the  appellant  has   to   meet,   see   VHR
    (unmeritorious grounds) Jamaica [2014] UKUT 00367 (IAC).

 9. Comment has been made in the application and in the refusal  and  grant
    of permission to appeal of the extraordinary length of the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal, some 73 pages. Whilst valid criticism  may  be
    made of a lack of concise reasoning, it  does  not  necessarily  follow
    that the decision is unsustainable, perverse or irrational, or that  it
    discloses material error of law such  that  it  should  be  set  aside.
    Having taken care to consider the decision in the light of the grounds,
    I do not agree with Judge Kebede's suggestion that there is a  lack  of
    clarity in the decision. Although  it  takes  some  time  to  read  and
    digest, and could and should have been more concise, I  find  that  the
    decision is very clear and precise, providing cogent  reasons  open  to
    the judge for the conclusions drawn.

10. From the grounds, which have also been criticised for  length,  I  have
    identified 7 heads of criticism  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Before addressing those grounds, I  note  that  there  is  no
    challenge to substantial parts of the decision, including, for example,
    the finding that ST was not a reliable, credible or  truthful  witness,
    and as to the assessment from �53 onwards  of  the  appellant's  mental
    health and suicide risk.

11. Further, I  note  that  the  dismissal  of  the  appeal  rests  on  the
    credibility  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,   rejecting   the
    appellant's factual claim, for the reasons cited by the judge. Many  of
    the  other  findings  and  conclusions  in  the  decision  are  in  the
    alternative and thus any actual or perceived error of law not material,
    provided the primary credibility findings are sustainable.

Ground 1

12. At �7 of the grounds �23 of the decision is criticised in  relation  to
    the judge's findings as to an operation  on  the  appellant's  ear.  Mr
    Collins conceded in his oral submissions that it was not the  strongest
    point.

13. In fact, the grounds substantially misstate the  finding  made  by  the
    judge. What the judge did not accept, for cogent reasons based  on  the
    evidence before the Tribunal set out in the decision, was the assertion
    that the appellant had an operation on her ear  in  February  2011;  he
    found it was in fact around 2009.  The  appellant  case  relied  on  an
    injury to the ear arising from mistreatment by the authorities  between
    2011 and 2013 and thus  it  was  highly  relevant  to  the  credibility
    assessment.

14. Neither was the judge ignorant of the appellant's several physical  and
    mental health challenges, as is suggested in  this  ground.  The  judge
    accepted that there had been a serious operation for a severe condition
    in April 2011. At �37 the judge accepted the  medical  findings  of  Dr
    Garwood  there  listed,  and  accepted  that  there  was  a  reasonable
    likelihood that at some  time  in  the  past  the  appellant  has  been
    subjected to physical violence sufficient to cause the scars described.
    In many respects the judge's treatment  of  the  various  physical  and
    mental challenges of the appellant is sympathetic. However,  the  judge
    justifiably pointed out the  deficiencies  in  the  medical  and  other
    evidence as to when such injury occurred or disability  occasioned.  At
    �41 the judge explained why he did  not  accept  that  the  appellant's
    physical  health  and  psychiatric  condition  had  been  shown  to  be
    attributable to any alleged mistreatment in the period 2011-2013, which
    was highly relevant to the credibility assessment  of  the  appellant's
    factual account.

15. In the circumstances, there is no merit in  this  first  ground,  which
    discloses no error of law.

Ground 2

16. The second ground, set out between �8 and �12 of the  grounds,  is  the
    only ground in my view with any potential merit. The complaint is  that
    the judge failed to follow the country guidance decision of IK (Turkey)
    [2004] UKIAT 00312. The judge addressed this both at �24 to �29 of  the
    decision, giving reasons for departing from the guidance, and,  in  the
    alternative, considered most if not all of the factors in IK  elsewhere
    in the decision.

17. Pointing first to the age of IK, decided some 10 years ago,  the  judge
    set out at some length, perhaps unnecessarily lengthy, the ratios of IK
    and A (Turkey) [2003] UKAIT 00034, and the country evidence upon  which
    they were based. At �26 the  judge  found  that  the  country  evidence
    before him did not justify the conclusion in IK that torture  continues
    to be endemic in Turkey. The judge went on at �26  to  point  out  that
    there was nothing in the current  country  evidence  to  indicate  that
    torture was a systematic or  pervasive  technique  of  law  enforcement
    agencies in Turkey. The judge cited extracts from 2013 reports  to  the
    effect that such practises are prohibited by the constitution  and  law
    and that human rights organisations had reported allegations of torture
    and  abuse,  but  not  in  places  of  detention,  but  rather   during
    demonstrations and transfers to prison.  That  was,  the  judge  found,
    important, as there was a distinction to be drawn between detention and
    arrest. The judge concluded that there was  nothing  to  indicate  that
    torture in places  of  detention  was  systematically  employed.  After
    reviewing  the  evidence,  the  judge  concluded  at   �28   that   the
    circumstances currently prevailing in Turkey and between 2011 and  2013
    were not as those prevailing in  2003  or  2004  when  A  and  IK  were
    decided. The judge then set out paragraph by paragraph a summary of his
    reasons for reaching that conclusion. The judge's own experience, cited
    at the end of �28 was irrelevant,  but  nothing  material  arises  from
    this, as he made clear that this observation was not  relied  on  as  a
    foundation for the conclusion reached.

18. By the end of �28 the judge concluded that he was  not  satisfied  that
    torture and physical abuse of persons in places of detention in  Turkey
    is reasonably likely to occur, either now or back in 2011 to 2013.

19. The matters set out in �9 and �10 of the grounds are  not  material  to
    the decision.

20. Whilst a different judge may have reached a different conclusion, it is
    open to the First-tier Tribunal Judge to depart from a country guidance
    case, provided there is good reason for doing so. Another Tribunal  may
    not agree with the distinction made by Judge  Bennett,  but  given  the
    careful, detailed, explanation, I do not  find  the  conclusion  either
    irrational or perverse. The judge has given cogent reasons open to  him
    on the evidence cited for departing from the country guidance case.  Mr
    Collins' astonishment at the temerity of the judge to depart  from  the
    country guidance case law does not mean that to do so on the  facts  of
    this case was "misguided and simply perverse," of a "frolic entirely of
    the Immigration Judge's own making," as claimed in the grounds.

21. In the circumstances, I find no merit in this second ground of appeal.

Ground 3

22. This complaint, set out in a few lines in �13 of the ground, suggesting
    that the judge speculated  in  �31  and  �32  as  to  identity  of  the
    biological father and the circumstances of conception, is not  material
    to the outcome of the appeal and discloses no error of law.  The  judge
    embarked on this issue when considering  the  very  young  age  of  the
    appellant when ST was conceived. The judge reached the conclusion  that
    whilst it was possible that the woman at the appeal hearing was not the
    person identified in the documents referred to, he was  satisfied  that
    it was reasonably likely that she is who she claims to be  and  is  the
    mother of ST. The reason for consideration of the parentage of ST  was,
    as made clear in �31, given the absence of evidence and the  young  age
    of the appellant at which he was conceived, at which age in the UK  she
    would have been considered the  victim  of  rape,  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that the circumstances were not traumatic, either  physically
    or psychologically or both, and that she may have been raped or  abused
    by one or more individuals. It is not entirely clear, but it  may  have
    been a possible causation as to the appellant's past and present mental
    and physical health  challenges.  This  discussion  was  probably  more
    speculative than probative, but in fact nothing  significant  turns  on
    the conclusion.

Ground 4

23. This complaint, set out at �14 and �15 of  the  grounds  addresses  the
    credibility findings in relation to the appellant. To some  degree  the
    argument  is  circular,  suggesting  that  the  findings  are   "wholly
    unsustainable because they are predicated on  the  Immigration  Judge's
    misguided belief that arbitrary detention  and  ill-treatment  did  not
    take place in Turkey in 2010 or 2011, which harks back to Ground 2  and
    the judge's departure from the country guidance case law. Further,  the
    ground is finds fault with some aspects  of  the  credibility  findings
    whilst ignoring the larger and overwhelming picture as to why the judge
    found, taking the evidence as a whole, the appellant's factual case was
    not credible. The  ground  also  substantially  misstates  the  judge's
    actual findings and the evidence relied on, which  drew  a  distinction
    between mistreatment at demonstrations or transfers to prison and noted
    no allegations of mistreatment in detention, the appellant claiming  to
    have been mistreated during detention at the Vatan Street headquarters.



24.  Complaint  is  made  about  �35(d)(2)  of  the  decision,   which   is
    characterised in the grounds as a belief on the part of the judge  that
    only high profile political activists are of adverse  interest  to  the
    authorities or susceptible to intimidation and  pressure.  It  is  said
    that this "flies in the face of all the learning about how the  Turkish
    authorities operate."  However,  the  grounds  fail  to  point  to  the
    specific evidence to support that sweeping generalisation.

25. The grounds also, again, misstate what the judge stated. At this  point
    of the decision the judge  reached  the  conclusion,  as  part  of  the
    assessment of the appellant's credibility, that there was "an  inherent
    lack of likelihood" that after being allegedly mistreated in  detention
    the authorities asked her to act as an informant to obtain  information
    linking BDP with the PKK. The judge went on to set out his reasons  for
    this  part  of  the  credibility  findings,  including  that  when   he
    considered  her   then   psychiatric   problems,   including   auditory
    halluincations, had lost the sight in one eye  and  was  continuing  to
    suffer from the consequences of the brain operation, it would have been
    obvious to the authorities that she was in poor health, both physically
    and mentally.

26. I find that the judge has provided cogent reasons, open to him  on  the
    evidence, to reach the conclusion that he found the appellant neither a
    reliable nor credible witness. It is this finding which is at the heart
    of the dismissal of the appeal; the factual  basis  of  the  claim  was
    found not credible. In the circumstances,  there  would  have  been  no
    particular risk on return, regardless of the country guidance, or  need
    for relocation.

27. In the circumstances no material error of  law  is  disclosed  in  this
    ground.

Ground 5

28. The complaint at �16 of the grounds is that at �37 of the decision  the
    judge did not engage with the medical report of Dr Garwood, "and relies
    on   speculation,   conjecture   and   irrelevant   considerations   in
    "discounting" the reports conclusions.

29. Once again, the ground makes a sweeping  generalisation  and  fails  to
    provide any particularity to the  complaint.  More  significantly,  it,
    again, substantially misstates the actual findings of  the  judge.  The
    judge did not discount Dr Garwood's report, or fail to engage with  it.
    It is referred to extensively in the decision, including in the section
    from �53 as to risk from mental health and suicide. The judge  accepted
    all the factual findings of Dr Garwood, setting out what  was  accepted
    in the sub-paragraphs to �37. The judge  concluded  that  there  was  a
    reasonable likelihood that at some time in the past the  appellant  has
    been subjected to physical  violence  sufficient  to  cause  the  scars
    described. However, the judge noted that the evidence  did  not  assist
    with when such injuries or incidents  took  place.  At  �38  the  judge
    pointed out that Dr Garwood's report did  not  deal  with  the  EPIKRIZ
    document  which  contained  facts  inconsistent  with  the  appellant's
    account, and gave no consideration to the actual or potential past  and
    present consequences of various  matters  set  out  at  �38(c)  of  the
    decision.

30. What was discounted (at the end  of  �38)  was  the  conclusion  of  Dr
    Garwood "insofar as they are related to the question  of  whether  what
    she stated as to the events  of  2011-2013  was  accurate."  The  judge
    pointed  out  that  Dr  Garwood  did  not  have  the  EPIKRIZ  document
    indicating that the ear operation took place  two  years  earlier  than
    claimed, in 2009.

31. At �39 the judge reached the conclusion, for cogent reasons open to him
    on the evidence, that he was not satisfied that he had  been  told  the
    truth about what happened in 2011-2013 and was not satisfied that there
    was any police interest in her during that period.  She  had,  at  some
    point in the past, been subjected to severe mistreatment, but the judge
    could not conclude that this was during  the  period  relevant  to  the
    appellant's factual claim. The judge went on at �40 to explain  why  he
    concluded that taking the evidence as a whole and in the light  of  his
    earlier findings, there was any  real  likelihood  that  the  appellant
    would be of any interest to  the  Turkish  authorities  on  account  of
    alleged past BDP involvement. At �41 the judge summarised  those  parts
    of the appellant's case that he was not satisfied about, in essence did
    not believe.

Ground 6

32. In the light of the above, there is no merit or error of law  disclosed
    in the assertion in ground 6 that at �40 the judge's conclusion at  �40
    were "misguided and disrespectful." I do not see what is disrespectful,
    or misguided. This was but one part of the overall  findings  that  the
    claim that she was or would be of interest to the  Turkish  authorities
    was not credible.

Ground 7

33. �18 of the grounds seeks to address the risk on return, suggesting that
    the judge should have identified risk  on  return  to  the  home  area,
    rather than risk on return at the  airport.  However,  as  this  is  an
    alternative finding in the decision, there can be no material error  of
    law in  this  complaint.  I  have  found  not  material  error  in  the
    credibility findings rejecting the appellant's factual  account.  There
    was thus no reason for the appellant to have any fear or be at any risk
    on return. However, as Mr Duffy pointed out  in  his  submissions,  the
    judge has effectively addressed the risk factors within  the  decision,
    in particular between �44 and �49, giving reasons for  the  conclusions
    reached.

34. In the circumstances, I do not accept  the  assertion  at  �19  of  the
    grounds that there has been a "wholesale failure on  the  part  of  the
    judge to analyse the risk factors relating to the appellant." �19  sets
    out factors which is it is submitted were not considered,  for  example
    the lack of a Turkish passport, which was  in  fact  addressed  by  the
    judge at �48. Similarly the consequence for the appellant that ST is  a
    refugee who fled Turkey was considered by the judge, who found that  he
    was an unreliable and uncreditworthy witness, whose account  could  not
    be accepted, a finding which has not been challenged in the grounds.

35. More significantly, Mr Duffy points out that  the  judge's  alternative
    findings from �50 onwards that it would not be unreasonable  or  unduly
    harsh to expect the appellant to relocate within Turkey away  from  her
    home area entirely undercuts the thrust of the complaint that the judge
    failed to address the risk factors in the home area. If  the  appellant
    can relocate, which was not challenged in the findings, she has no risk
    in the home area, as she need not return there.

36. In the circumstances, for the reasons set out above, I find no material
    errors of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.   Whilst  the
    decision could and should have been  capable  of  being  set  out  more
    concisely, it does provide adequate and cogent reasons for the findings
    and conclusions made, which were open to the judge on the  evidence.  I
    do not find that the decision can properly be described as perverse  or
    irrational. Simply put, the  judge  did  not  believe  the  appellant's
    account and it flows from that that she is not at risk on  return,  but
    even if she is at any risk,  the  unchallenged  finding  that  she  can
    relocate away from the home area means that there  is  no  well-founded
    fear of persecution or real risk of serious harm on return.

Conclusions:

37. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
