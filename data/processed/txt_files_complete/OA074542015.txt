                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer, Islamabad, against  a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Farmer) allowing  an  appeal
    by the applicant against a decision made on 7 April 2015  refusing  her
    entry clearance as a spouse.  In this decision, I  will  refer  to  the
    parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal, the  applicant  as
    the appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer as the respondent.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  28  April  1995.   She
    applied for entry clearance on 12 January  2015  for  settlement  as  a
    partner under para EC-P.1.1 of Appendix  FM  but  her  application  was
    refused as she did not meet the relevant income threshold  requirement.
    It was  accepted  that  the  appellant  was  exempt  from  meeting  the
    requirements of para E-ECP.3.1 as the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  a
    carer's allowance. She had to meet the requirements of  para  E-ECP.3.3
    of  showing  that  she  and  her  husband  could  be   maintained   and
    accommodated  adequately  without  recourse  to  public   funds.    The
    respondent was not satisfied from the  evidence  before  him  that  she
    could do so. She appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

3.   At [6] of his decision the judge said that the gist of the  appellant's
    case was that there was no set income level in the Rules  stating  what
    was needed for a couple to maintain  themselves.   The  judge  accepted
    that the sponsor was in  receipt  of  disability  living  allowance  of
    �21.55 per week and jobseeker allowance of �41.40 per week.   She  also
    found that the sponsor would be accommodated with the appellant in  his
    family home where he lives with his mother, accepting that both his and
    his mother's evidence was truthful and credible.  She accepted that his
    mother worked and paid the rent and would continue to do  so  and  that
    the property was suitable for the appellant to join  the  sponsor.  His
    brother who also lived there worked and contributed financially to  the
    utilities and outgoings.

4.   The judge accepted the submission made on behalf of the appellant  that
    there was no financial threshold that must be met to determine  whether
    the appellant would be adequately maintained and said  that  it  was  a
    question of looking at all the evidence in the round and at  the  needs
    and resources of the parties.  She found that the respondent had  erred
    in finding that, as the sponsor's income was less than �113.70 per week
    (the relevant income support level), the appellant did not satisfy  the
    criteria.  The judge  accepted  that  the  appellant  and  sponsor  had
    savings as they had been given  approximately  �5,000  by  friends  and
    family and that this had been transferred to the appellant, the sponsor
    being candid enough to say that he thought this was the best  thing  to
    do as he kept dipping into the money when it was supposed to be used to
    support them as a couple when she came to the UK.   She  accepted  that
    the appellant and sponsor would have the  use  of  these  funds,  about
    �4,500, to support themselves in the UK and found that  they  would  be
    able to maintain and accommodate themselves adequately without recourse
    to public funds.  The appeal was allowed accordingly.





The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

5.   The respondent argues in the grounds that the judge  erred  in  law  by
    finding that there was no financial threshold that must be met contrary
    to the decision of the AIT in KA &  Others  (adequacy  of  maintenance)
    Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065.

6.   At the hearing on 6 April 2017 Mr Lemer accepted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in law and that the existence of a financial  threshold,
    set at the relevant income support level, had been  made  clear  in  KA
    (Pakistan) and in the provisions of para 6A of the Rules.  However,  he
    argued that whilst the Tribunal had erred in law,  the  error  was  not
    material as, whilst  there  was  a  shortfall  of  �50.75  between  the
    relevant income support level of �113.70 and the sponsor's benefits  of
    �62.95, the savings of �4,500 would cover that shortfall for  about  88
    weeks, the sponsor's mother and brother would  be  paying  the  utility
    bills and outgoings and this would  amount  to  a  significant  further
    addition  to  the  sponsor's  available  income  and  that,  given  the
    appellant's accepted level of education and ability to work, she  would
    be able to obtain employment within 88 weeks, earning a weekly  sum  in
    excess of �50.75.  In summary, he submitted that on the evidence before
    the First-tier Tribunal the appeal should  have  been  allowed  in  any
    event.

7.   Mr Bramble disagreed arguing that the savings would only provide a  top
    up for about 21 months instead of 30  months,  the  initial  period  of
    leave.  The issues relating to third party support and the  appellant's
    employment capacity had not been adequately  dealt  with  and,  on  the
    information before the judge, the appellant  would  fail  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.

The Error of Law

8.   It is rightly conceded that the judge erred in law when  he  said  that
    there was no relevant financial threshold.  It is clear  from  both  KA
    (Pakistan) and para  6A  of  the  Rules  that  the  relevant  financial
    threshold is the level of income support that would be available to the
    family.

9.   I do not accept Mr Lemer's submission that the  judge's  error  of  law
    had no material bearing on the outcome of the appeal.   It  is  correct
    that the judge accepted that the sponsor, his mother  and  brother  all
    contributed financially to the household and that there were savings of
    �4,500.  He also accepted the evidence of  both  the  sponsor  and  his
    mother as truthful  and  credible.   However,  their  evidence  was  an
    expression of their intentions but with no further analysis of  whether
    those intentions could be fulfilled.  Applications based on third party
    support, if the appellant is able to rely  on  such  support,  must  be
    considered with care so  that  the  financial  realities  are  properly
    considered:  Mahad  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  [2009]  UKSC  16  and
    Jahangara Begum (maintenance and savings) [2011]  UKUT  246  Bangladesh
    [2011].  Similarly, any  assessment  of  the  appellant's  own  earning
    capacity, if relevant under the Rules, must be based on evidence  about
    her qualifications and abilities and the availability of  work.   I  am
    not therefore satisfied that this is a case where the error of law  had
    no material bearing on the outcome of the appeal.

10.  The decision is, accordingly, set aside and is to  be  re-made  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  I record that it was accepted that there was no  issue
    in relation to the  adequacy  of  accommodation  or  with  the  figures
    relating to the benefits received  by  the  sponsor  and  the  relevant
    income support level.  I also directed that if either party  wished  to
    re-open those issues, they may only do so if they gave adequate  notice
    to the other party.

11.  Following directions made at the end of the error of law  hearing,  the
    appellant has submitted a  further  bundle  of  documents  indexed  and
    paginated  1-142  supplementing  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in the bundle indexed and paginated 1-164.  The respondent has
    not sought to re-open the issues referred to in [10] above.

12.  At the resumed hearing Mr Kotas indicated that it  was  his  submission
    that as the decision was taken on  7  April  2015  and  related  to  an
    application made before  6  April  2015,  by  virtue  of  the  relevant
    transitional  provisions  in  article  9(C)(2)  the  appeal  should  be
    determined under the Rules as at the date of decision and in accordance
    with s.85(5) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,
    requiring that only the circumstances appertaining at the time  of  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance should be considered.  There  is  no
    dispute between the parties that this is the proper approach and I note
    that it was the approach taken by the First-tier Tribunal judge as  set
    out in [4] of her decision.  Secondly, Mr Kotas indicated that  it  was
    his submission that under the Rules at the date of decision third party
    support was excluded from consideration of whether the requirements  of
    para E-ECP.3.3(b) were met.  This  point  is  in  dispute  between  the
    parties, Ms Wass submitting that the provisions of para  E-ECP.3.3  are
    freestanding and not covered by the restrictions set out in Appendix FM-
    SE.

Further Evidence

13.  I heard further evidence from  the  sponsor  who  adopted  his  witness
    statement of 21 June 2017 and his mother and brother similarly adopted
    their statements of the same  date.   There  was  very  limited  cross-
    examination save on minor points of detail.  I note that the First-tier
    Tribunal judge accepted the evidence of the sponsor and his  mother  as
    truthful and credible.  I also accept their evidence  as  set  out  in
    their witness statements and the evidence of the sponsor's brother.

14.  At the date of decision  the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  disability
    living allowance of �21.55 per  week  and  job  seeker's  allowance  of
    �41.40 a week, benefits totalling �62.95.  The income support level was
    �113.70 and there was therefore a weekly shortfall of �50.75.

15.  The sponsor's financial  circumstances  have  changed  since  the  last
    hearing and he is now in part-time employment receiving wages of �470 a
    month/�108.48 a week and he  continues  to  receive  disability  living
    allowance at the rate of �22 a week and so has a total weekly income of
    �130.46.  In the circumstances, the sponsor is, prima facie  at  least,
    able to demonstrate that he now meets the relevant income threshold  of
    para E-ECP.3.3 as his income is higher than the relevant income support
    level.

16.  In his witness statement he says that he and the  appellant  have  been
    advised to make a  fresh  entry  clearance  application  following  the
    change in their financial situation but he adds  that  this  is  not  a
    viable option as  he  would  not  have  sufficient  funds  to  pay  the
    increased application fee and the additional cost  of  the  immigration
    health surcharge as well as the legal fees.

17.  In her witness statement the sponsor's  mother  confirms  that  she  is
    responsible for the rent of the family home and all the utility  bills.
    She receives a financial  contribution  from  her  son,  the  sponsor's
    brother, who contributes �450  every  month.   She  adds  that  she  is
    willing to offer the appellant �150 a month as third party support.  In
    his witness statement the sponsor's brother confirms that  he  also  is
    willing to provide the appellant �150 per month through the  period  of
    her leave and confirms his contribution to the household expenses.   He
    adds  that  the  sponsor  has  limited  earning  capacity  due  to  his
    disability and does not make any contribution to the household expenses
    and this will continue after the appellant arrives in the UK.  I accept
    that the offers of support are genuine and that this  support  will  be
    provided so long as necessary.

Assessment of the Issues

18.  I must now turn to the issue of whether, when  considering  the  appeal
    under the Rules as at the date of decision, it is open to the appellant
    and sponsor to rely on third party support or the  appellant's  earning
    capacity.  The relevant provisions are set out in Appendix  FM  in  the
    financial requirements at E-ECP.3.1 - E-ECP.3.4.  It is provided in E-
    ECP.3.1 that "an applicant must provide  specified  evidence  from  the
    sources listed in para E-ECP.3.2 of ...(c) the requirements in para  E-
    ECP.3.3 being met."


19.  The provisions of E-ECP.3.2 provide that, when determining whether  the
    financial requirement in para E-ECP.3.1 is met, only particular sources
    of income will be taken into account including income  of  the  partner
    from specified  employment  or  self-employment.   The  wording  of  E-
    ECP.3.3(b) provides that "the  applicant  must  provide  evidence  that
    their partner is able  to  maintain  and  accommodate  themselves,  the
    applicant and any dependants adequately in the UK without  recourse  to
    public funds."

20.   Ms  Wass'  argument  is  that  para  E-ECP.3.3(b)  refers  simply   to
    "evidence" and does not require specified evidence  and  therefore  the
    restrictions on the evidence which can be  relied  on  as  set  out  in
    Appendices FM and FM-SE do not apply.  In this context, it is right  to
    note that the word "specified", which preceded "evidence", was  deleted
    from para E-ECP.3.3 on 20 July 2012.   She  further  submits  that  the
    provisions relating to specified evidence set out in Appendix FM-SE  at
    para A1 and 1 do not therefore apply.

21.  However, it is clear from Appendix FM-SE that para  A1  is  limited  to
    particular paragraphs, including E-ECP.3.1 but not covering  E-ECP.3.3.
    whereas para 1 provides that in relation to  evidencing  the  financial
    requirements in Appendix FM  the  following  general  provisions  shall
    apply.  These include at  para  1(b)  that  "Promises  of  third  party
    support will not  be  accepted.   Third  party  support  will  only  be
    accepted in the form of" [four identified categories, only one of which
    is relevant in  the  present  appeal  sub-para  (iii)]  "gift  of  cash
    savings, whose source must be declared,  ...  provided  that  the  cash
    savings had been held by the person or persons ...  for  at  least  six
    months prior to the date of application and are under their control".

22.  I do not  accept  as  argued  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the
    provisions of para ECP.3.3 are free-standing such that  the  provisions
    of Appendix FM-SE do not apply.  The fact that E-ECP.3.3 is referred to
    in E-ECP.3.1 means that it falls within E-ECP 3.2 with the  restriction
    on the sources of income that can be relied on and, although para A1 of
    Appendix FM-SE does not apply to E-ECP.3.3, the provisions of E-ECP.3.3
    set out a financial requirement within Appendix FM (regardless  of  the
    deletion of "specified" within that paragraph) and it must follow  that
    the restrictions in para 1 of Appendix FM-SE do apply.

23.  Unfortunately, therefore, so far as the appellant  is  concerned,  when
    assessing the position under the Rules it is not open  to  me  to  take
    into account issues of third party support  save  in  relation  to  the
    funds of �4,500 received as wedding gifts or of the appellant's earning
    capacity as the Rules require reliance on the sponsor's earnings.  I am
    not satisfied that savings  of  �4,500  can  properly  be  regarded  as
    sufficient to meet the shortfall of �50.75  per  week  looking  at  the
    position as at the date of decision.  As set out at  [7]  above,  these
    savings will only provide a top up for about 21 months as opposed to 30
    months, the period of leave which would  be  granted  on  a  successful
    application.

24.  So far as the position  under  article  8  is  concerned  I  have  been
    referred to the judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  MM  (Lebanon)  v
    Secretary of State [2017] UKSC 10.  This judgment  confirmed  that  the
    restriction on taking into account alternative sources of  funding  set
    out in the Rules is not irrational and does not make the Rules unlawful
    but also  indicated  that  a  broader  approach  could  be  taken  when
    assessing whether the circumstances gave rise to a positive  article  8
    duty as explained in Jeunesse v Netherlands [2015] 60 EHRR 17.

25.  However, article 8 must be assessed as at the date of decision as  this
    is an entry clearance case and not as at the date of this  hearing.   I
    am satisfied that at the date of decision a  fair  balance  was  struck
    between the public interest in  controlling  immigration  by  requiring
    compliance with the Rules and the positive obligation to afford respect
    to family life.  The simple fact was that the appellant could not  meet
    the requirements of the Rules. It is correct  that  circumstances  have
    changed since the decision as the appellant  and  the  sponsor  have  a
    young child living with the appellant in Pakistan but, constrained as I
    am to assess the position  as  at  the  date  of  decision,  I  am  not
    satisfied that the refusal of entry clearance was disproportionate to a
    legitimate aim within article 8(2).  I am therefore not satisfied  that
    the respondent's decision was at the date  of  decision  in  breach  of
    article 8.

26.  Accordingly, looking at the position as at the  date  of  decision  and
    considering the circumstances appertaining at that time, I must dismiss
    the appeal on both immigration and  human  rights  grounds.  It  is  of
    course open to the appellant to make a fresh application.

Decision

27.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and  the  decision  has  been  set
    aside.  I must re-make  the  decision  by  dismissing  the  appellant's
    appeal.  No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.
