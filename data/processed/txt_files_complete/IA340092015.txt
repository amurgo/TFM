                 ERROR OF LAW FINDING -DECISION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Grimmett ('the Judge') who in a decision promulgated on 14 September
        2016 dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
        refusal to issue a Residence Card as  confirmation  of  a  right  to
        reside in the UK as the spouse of an EEA national exercising  treaty
        rights.



Background


     2. The appellant, a citizen of India, was born  on  22  May  1992.   He
        entered the United Kingdom on 7 October 2010 with leave as a student
        which was subsequently extended in both 2013 and 2014.  On  1  April
        2015, the appellant applied for  a  residence  card  as  the  family
        member of his wife, a Slovakian national, whom he married on 9  July
        2015.
     3. The application was refused as the Secretary of State as it was said
        the marriage was a marriage  of  convenience  and  because  the  EEA
        national family member had failed to provide evidence that she was a
        'qualified person'.
     4. Having considered the evidence with the required degree  of  anxious
        scrutiny the Judge sets out her findings at [7]-[16]  which  can  be
        summarised in the following terms:


        a.   Notwithstanding difficulties with the  interpreter  the  Judge
             was satisfied that the  appellant  and  his  wife  were  in  a
             genuine marriage because it  appeared  they  had  been  living
             together since their marriage for  some  time  and  there  was
             evidence relating to a child who was, unfortunately, stillborn
             [8].


        b.   The Judge was not satisfied the appellant  and  his  wife  are
             still in a relationship as a result of discrepancies  relating
             to issues surrounding an address it was  claimed  the  parties
             lived at,  when  the  appellant's  P60  for  2016  provided  a
             different address [9].


        c.   The Judge finds, however, that the  question  of  whether  the
             parties lived together or not did not affect  the  appellant's
             position  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
             Regulations 2006 (as amended) for under  the  Regulations  the
             appellant and his wife remain married [9].


        d.   The Judge was not satisfied the appellant had shown  that  his
             wife is exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom for the
             reasons set out at [10] - [15].


        e.   The Judge found that considering the inconsistencies  together
             with the lack of independent evidence to show the  appellant's
             wife   has   worked   and   is   making   National   Insurance
             contributions, she was  not  satisfied  the  EEA  national  is
             exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom. It  was  noted
             the appellant was aware that the respondent had been unable to
             verify his  wife's  income  through  enquiries,  yet  had  not
             produced anything to show she is in lawful employment.


     5. As the appellant had not  discharged  the  burden  to  show  he  was
        married to an EEA national exercising treaty rights in  the  UK  the
        appeal was dismissed.
   6. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  challenging  the  Judges
      findings  in  relation  to  the  relationship,  and  whether  it   was
      continuing,  and  the  findings  about  the  EEA   national   sponsors
      employment, claiming that there were several  documents  contained  in
      the appeal bundle.
   7.  Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Hodgkinson on 15 December 2016, the operative part of the grant  being
      the following terms:


        "3.  It is  arguable  that  the  Judges  reasoning  is  flawed,  in
             concluding that the relationship between the appellant and the
             sponsor is no longer subsisting, as  there  is  no  indication
             that the sole piece of evidence relied upon by the  Judge,  in
             arriving at that conclusion, was referred to the appellant  or
             sponsor for their comment, and the Judge does  not  appear  to
             have considered the totality  of  the  available  evidence  in
             arriving at such adverse conclusion. The Judge  accepted  that
             their relationship had been a genuine one and, by implication,
             therefore appears to have concluded that  their  marriage  was
             not one of convenience, but does  not  say  so  in  terms.  It
             cannot be said that such arguable  errors  are  immaterial  as
             they are linked to the issue of the exercise of Treaty  rights
             and, were the decision  to  be  upheld,  then  the  Devaseelan
             guidelines would apply to any future appeal.


        4.   The Judges findings with reference to the appellant's sponsors
             claimed employments  appear  to  be  adequately  reasoned  and
             sustainable and, in itself, reveals no obvious arguable errors
             of law. However, as this issue is also inextricably linked  to
             the question of the subsistence of the  relationship  (eg  see
             [11] and [12] of the decision), permission is also granted  on
             this ground. In short, permission is granted  on  all  grounds
             pleaded."


     8. The Respondent  in  her  Rule  24  response  dated  6  January  2017
        challenges the application asserting there is no legal error in  the
        decision.




Error of law


     9. There is specific reference  in  the  grant  of  permission  to  two
        paragraphs  of  the  decision  under  challenge  which  are  in  the
        following terms:


        "11.      She said she worked for 40 hours each Monday and  Friday;
             she did not work on Sundays or Saturdays and her husband  also
             worked at the shop. She earned �650 which  is  paid  into  her
             bank at the end of each week. Her husband worked  from  Monday
             to Friday and she said that he earned the same amount  as  she
             did.


        12.  The appellant, however, said his wife was paid  about  �650  a
             month. He worked from 9 till 1 but sometimes he had Wednesdays
             or Thursdays off and he always worked on a Saturday. He earned
             �450. He was paid cash in hand by his uncle."


    10. The above appear to be findings reasonably open to the Judge on  the
        evidence who records firstly the nature  of  the  evidence  provided
        and, secondly, the contradictory nature of that evidence.
    11. The assertion the Judge found against the applicants on the basis of
        one piece of evidence that should have been put to the  parties  has
        no arguable merit.   Proceedings  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  are
        adversarial in nature and the evidence relied upon is that  provided
        by the appellant. It is not a case of the Judge relying on  evidence
        of which the appellant had no notice. That evidence is  recorded  at
        [9] in the following terms:


        "9.  I am  not  satisfied,  however,  that  they  are  still  in  a
             relationship despite their evidence before me to suggest  they
             were. The appellant said in his witness statement and  in  his
             oral evidence that he lived at [ ] Bacchus Road,  the  address
             of his uncle's hairdresser's shop which  is  also  his  wife's
             address. On his wife's P60 for April 2016 which  was  prepared
             by her employer who is the appellant's uncle, her address  was
             given as [ ] Bacchus Road.  The appellant's 2016 P60, prepared
             by the same person, gives his address as [ ] Reycroft  Avenue.
             It does not appear, therefore, that the appellant and his wife
             are  still  living  together.  That  does   not   affect   the
             appellant's position under the  regulations  and  he  and  his
             wife, it appears, remained married."


    12. Considering the lack of an adequate explanation  for  why  important
        tax documents should be sent  to  the  appellant  and  his  wife  at
        different addresses the Judge was  arguably  entitled  to  draw  the
        adverse conclusion she did. In any event, it is not  made  out  that
        even if the appellant and his wife were  living  together  that  the
        Judges conclusions regarding the residential address  are  material.
        The appellant's claim was for a Residence  Card  as  evidence  of  a
        right to reside in the United Kingdom as the family member of an EEA
        national exercising treaty rights. A spouse is a family member which
        would satisfy the first part of the test but this does not bear  any
        direct relationship to the factual issue of whether the EEA national
        is exercising treaty rights. This is an important consideration  for
        the right of family members to reside with the EEA national is based
        upon there being no obstruction to  an  EEA  national  exercising  a
        right of free movement to work in another Member  State  which  they
        might not be able to do if they could not have their family  members
        with them. A Residence Card does not  confer  upon  an  applicant  a
        freestanding right to reside as it is not an application similar  to
        a right to remain made under the Immigration Rules.
    13. The question of whether the EEA national is exercising treaty rights
        depends upon whether it was proved to the Judge's satisfaction  that
        the EEA national was a qualified person. The claim before the  Judge
        was that the EEA national is qualified as  a  worker.  The  evidence
        before the Judge cast doubt upon such a claim. The burden  of  proof
        is upon the appellant and/or EEA national  to  prove  that  the  EEA
        national is exercising treaty rights. As a  result  of  the  matters
        recorded in the decision, the Judge was arguably entitled to come to
        the conclusion that it had not been made out that the  EEA  national
        was exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.
    14. Mr Mills in his submission made specific reference to  [10]  of  the
        Judge's decision where it was found:


        "10.  I was not satisfied that the appellant has shown that his wife
             is exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom. It is  said
             that both he and she work for the  appellant's  uncle  in  his
             barbershop. The appellant's wife in interview  said  that  she
             worked as a cleaner in the shop and  had  done  so  since  she
             started to live with her husband which was sometime  in  2014.
             She could not remember the name of the hairdresser's shop  she
             says she worked at although it is  owned  by  the  appellant's
             uncle and bears the same name as the Appellant. It is also the
             address at which  she  says  she  lives.  The  P60  omits  the
             appellant's husbands National  Insurance  number  which  gives
             rise to doubts as to the reliability of the document."


    15. It was submitted by Mr Mills that the Judge was arguably entitled to
        come to adverse conclusions in relation to  the  claim  by  the  EEA
        national to be working at the same place as her husband when she did
        not even know the name of the place  she  had  worked  at  for  some
        considerable time, and the lack  of  the  reference  to  a  National
        Insurance number relating to the appellant, I agree.
    16. The grant of permission  acknowledges  that  there  was  no  obvious
        arguable legal error in the Judges  conclusions  regarding  the  EEA
        national's employment. The appellant has  failed  to  make  out  any
        inextricable link between the nature of the  relationship  and  such
        findings that could amount to legal error, let alone material  legal
        error.
    17. Mr Khurram submitted the Judges  findings  were  infected  by  legal
        error as a result of interpreter problems  experienced  by  the  EEA
        national during the marriage interview but it was also accepted that
        at no point was the Judge invited to put no weight upon  the  record
        of the interview. Accordingly, the  Judge  was  entitled  to  attach
        weight to that interview as she saw fit, as she did, and there is no
        arguable merit in a challenge to the degree of weight attached.
    18. In relation to the two distinct issues, the Judge  was  entitled  to
        conclude the appellant was a family member of an EEA national  based
        upon the existence of a marriage which is not infected  by  arguable
        legal error. The Judge was also entitled to  concluded  it  had  not
        been made out that the EEA national is exercising treaty  rights  in
        the UK. As indicated at the conclusion of  the  hearing  before  the
        Upper Tribunal, if  the  evidence  the  Judge  noted  was  not  made
        available to her is now available, such as to prove the  entitlement
        claimed, it is  always  open  to  the  appellant  to  make  a  fresh
        application for a Residence Card which can be considered  afresh  by
        the Secretary of State.


Decision

    19. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    20. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
