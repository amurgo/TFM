Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Akther, instructed by Hudson Legal


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
The Appeal

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of  State  against  a  determination
    promulgated on 8 April 2014 of First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade and  Dr
    J  O  de  Barros  which  allowed  the   respondent's   appeal   against
    deportation.

 2. For the purposes of this determination, I  refer  to  Mr  Supe  as  the
    appellant and to the Secretary of State as the  respondent,  reflecting
    their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Latvia and was born on 13 February 1994.

 4. The background to this matter is that on 15 March  2013  the  appellant
    was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment for the  offence  of  attempted
    robbery.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant was  entitled  to  the
    higher "serious grounds of public policy or public security"  test  set
    by in Regulation 21 (3) of the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 (the EEA Regulations).

 6. The respondent's first ground challenges that  finding.  She  maintains
    that the First-tier Tribunal did not indicate at [5] how the  appellant
    had shown that he had resided in the UK for 5 years in  line  with  the
    EEA Regulations. It was not accepted that there was evidence before the
    First-tier Tribunal showing that the appellant's mother had worked  and
    therefore been a qualified person in line with the EEA Regulations  for
    a period of 5 years,  the  appellant  thereby  also  gaining  permanent
    residence.

 7. I had no hesitation in finding that the evidence before the  First-tier
    Tribunal allowed only for the conclusion that  the  appellant's  mother
    had worked in line with the EEA Regulations for 5 years  prior  to  the
    appellant being sentenced to  imprisonment  in  2013.  The  appellant's
    mother provided her P60 document for 2008 to 2013 at pages 248  to  256
    of the appellant's bundle of  evidence  (AB).  The  appellant's  mother
    provided a P45 document dated 17 August 2007 at page 257 of AB  showing
    that she had earned ï¿½4,216 in that tax year. She provided at page 258 a
    letter dated 9 July 2007 stating that she had been working  in  the  UK
    from November 2006 to July 2007. It has  always  been  the  appellant's
    case, in his evidence and his mother's that he qualified for  permanent
    residence because of his mother's employment from 2006 onwards.

 8. Therefore, albeit  the  First-tier  Tribunal  address  bare  length  of
    residence as over 5 years at [5] of  the  determination,  the  evidence
    before them allowed only for the conclusion that  the  appellant's  was
    resident in line with the EEA Regulations during this period and so had
    acquired permanent residence and the benefit of the  "serious  grounds"
    test. The First-tier Tribunal did not err in applying that test.

 9. I should indicate that the suggestion in the  grounds  that  there  was
    evidence indicating that the appellant's mother had  not  been  working
    for 5 years prior to his sentence of imprisonment was withdrawn  before
    me quite properly by Mr Smart as it was  not  evidence  that  had  been
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

10. The respondent's second ground was that the  First-tier  Tribunal  gave
    inadequate   reasons   for   their   finding   that   the   appellant's
    rehabilitation prospects were better in the UK than in Latvia. Mr Smart
    conceded that the challenge was really one  of  disagreement  with  the
    Tribunal's conclusion on  this  matter  rather  than  really  being  an
    adequacy of reasons  challenge  and  took  the  point  no  further.  It
    appeared to me that Mr Smart was correct  to  take  that  view  of  the
    second ground. The appellant had demonstrated his remorse and intention
    not to reoffend and progress in his studies with  the  support  of  his
    family and friends and networks that he has established since coming to
    the UK at the age of 13. It was open  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    conclude that his rehabilitation  here  would  be  more  likely  to  be
    successful than if he were deported to Latvia and no error arises  from
    that finding.

Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an error on a
    point of law and shall stand.
