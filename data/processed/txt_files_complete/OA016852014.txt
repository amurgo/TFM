For the Appellant:     Mr Wainwright, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Tanzania born on 2nd November 1991.   The
    Appellant had applied for entry clearance as a partner  under  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules and her  application  was  refused  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer on 11th December 2013.  The Appellant  appealed
    and the appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Swaniker on
    24th November 2014.  In a determination promulgated on 7th January 2015
    the Appellant's appeal was allowed under the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Secretary of State on 13th January 2015 lodged Grounds of Appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal.  The issue was whether  or  not  the  income  threshold
    under the  Immigration  Rules  was  met  and  the  Secretary  of  State
    contended that the specified evidence is mandatory and that it had  not
    been open to the judge to use her  own  discretion  or  to  accept  the
    Sponsor's oral evidence in lieu of the specified evidence.

 2. On 17th February 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Frankish granted
    permission to appeal.   Judge  Frankish  noted  that  net  cash  salary
    payments at a bank may be grossed up to  calculate  income  where  this
    matches the gross on a pay slip but there was no finding  of  any  such
    tally between the two and therefore there was an arguable error of law.



 3. The matter thereafter came before me on 10th April  2015  to  determine
    whether or not there was a material error of law in the decision of the
    Fist-tier Tribunal Judge.  The parties' legal representatives  at  that
    hearing agreed the issue was straightforward, namely that the Appellant
    had to show that the income threshold under the Immigration  Rules  was
    met.  It was submitted that the judge did not engage with Appendix  FM-
    SE regarding the income threshold of �18,600.  I  found  the  Rule  was
    clear and that it was necessary in order to meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE A1(1)(n) that if wages were received in  cash  the  full
    amount had to be paid into a Sponsor's bank account in  order  for  the
    full amount to be counted.  I found that the gross amount of  any  cash
    may be counted where a person's specified bank statements  showed  that
    the net amount which related to the gross amount  shown  on  their  pay
    slips otherwise only the net amount on the  specified  bank  statements
    may be counted.  I acknowledge that the judge had used  discretion  and
    accepted  oral  testimony  in  lieu  of  the  specified   evidence   to
    effectively make that leap of faith but in such circumstances  I  found
    that there was a material error of law.

 4. The representatives agreed that the correct approach was for a schedule
    to be produced showing  a  paper  trail  of  payments  made  into  bank
    accounts during the relevant period  and  providing  that  paper  trail
    showed that the amount satisfied the  Rule  then  the  Appellant  would
    succeed.  On that basis I gave directions and adjourned the  matter  to
    be reheard on the fixed date of 15th May 2015.

 5. It is on that basis that the appeal now  comes  back  before  me.   The
    Appellant appears by her instructed Counsel Mr Wainwright and again  by
    her partner and Sponsor Mr Suleiman Ali Hamed.   In  support  of  their
    application there is also now produced a bundle of documents running to
    some 34 pages all of which I have given due consideration to.  In  this
    instance the Secretary of State appears by her Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer Mr Jarvis.

Submissions/Discussions

 6. It is agreed by the legal representatives the relevant Immigration Rule
    the Appellant needs to meet is Appendix FM(n).  This Rule stipulates:

         "(n) The gross amount of any cash income may be counted  where  the
             person's specified bank statements show the net  amount  which
             relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the
             relevant  specified  evidence  provided  in  addition  to  the
             specified  bank  statements  in  relation  to   non-employment
             income). Otherwise, only the net amount shown on the specified
             bank statements may be counted".

 7. It is agreed between the legal representatives,  and  I  confirm  their
    assessment therein, that consequently providing the  Sponsor  can  show
    that he meets the above Rule and for  at  least  six  months  prior  to
    making his application received �18,600 from his two  employments  then
    he will meet the Rules.

 8. Mr Wainwright starts by taking  me  to  page  7  of  the  supplementary
    bundle.  That sets out the  pay  slip  details  of  the  Sponsor's  two
    employments,  the  first  from  Illution  and  the  second  from   City
    Facilities.  He indicates that the problem arises with  regard  to  the
    payments from Illution in that those payments were paid by  cash.   The
    payments from City Facilities  are  paid  by  BACS  directly  into  the
    Appellant's bank account and they are reflected on pages 2 to 18 of his
    bank statements.  Further the payments made therein correspond with the
    pay slips which are produced at pages 24 to 33 of the new bundle.

 9. He therefore submits that the issue relates to the funds received  from
    Illution during the relevant period.  He takes me to the pay slips from
    Illution which are to be found at pages 21 to 23  and  cross-references
    from those pay slips entries made into the Sponsor's bank account.   Mr
    Wainwright acknowledges that the payments to the bank  account  do  not
    exactly equate to the Sponsor's net earnings from Illution in  that  he
    has not paid all monies in having kept a small amount for  his  day-to-
    day requirements.  He acknowledges that had these  payments  been  made
    directly into the bank account then the issue before the  Tribunal  may
    well not have emerged.  He  further  in  addition  in  support  of  the
    Sponsor's/Appellant's position refers me  firstly  to  the  annual  tax
    summary of Mr Hamed from HM Revenue & Customs which  reflects  for  the
    tax year 2013 to 2014 (i.e.  the  relevant  year)  that  the  Sponsor's
    income before tax was �25,963.04 gross  and  �21,954.90  net.   On  any
    figure he submits that that is  substantial  evidence  towards  showing
    that the Sponsor's income exceeds the minimum  threshold.   He  further
    refers me back to the original bundle and the  evidence  produced  from
    the Sponsor's accountants and submits that these two pieces of evidence
    together provide strong weight in support of the Sponsor's confirmation
    that he meets the minimum income requirements.

10. Mr Jarvis points out that applying the Rules  the  Secretary  of  State
    will only look back for a period of six  months  therefore  the  income
    received in March 2013 by the Sponsor would not be taken into  account.
    However, Mr Jarvis indicates that on behalf of the Secretary  of  State
    and that having seen the evidence  he  accepts  the  Sponsor  did  have
    sufficient income to meet the minimum requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules at the time he made his application based on his income both from
    Illution and City Facilities.

Findings

11. The burden of proof is the civil burden of  proof  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities.  As has been said  previously  in  the  course  of  this
    matter complications arise solely because the Sponsor Mr Hamed receives
    part of his income in cash but whilst the  gross  amount  of  any  cash
    income can be counted this only takes place where a person's  specified
    bank statements show the net amount which relates to the  gross  amount
    shown on their pay slips.  In the alternative an applicant is forced to
    rely only on the  net  amount  of  the  specified  bank  statements  as
    countable income.

12. The Sponsor has gone to considerable lengths to explain  his  financial
    circumstances and his instructing solicitor and Counsel  have  done  an
    excellent job in  being  able  to  cross-reference  item  by  item  the
    relevant payments.  Whilst the payment for 31st  March  2013  would  be
    excluded looking at the whole matter  overall  cross-referencing  every
    payment that has been made Mr Jarvis  concedes  that  the  paper  trail
    shows that the Sponsor meets the terms of the Immigration Rules  and  I
    endorse that view.  In such circumstances this  is  an  Appellant  that
    meets the terms of the Immigration Rules and the Appellant's appeal  is
    allowed.
