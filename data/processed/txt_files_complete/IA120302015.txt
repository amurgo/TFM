                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal  against  the  determination  of  Judge  S  J  Pacey,
    promulgated on 20th August 2015, following a hearing at Bennett  House,
    Stoke-on-Trent, on 14th August 2015.  In the determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, citizen of Bangladesh, who was  born  on  10th
    November 1984.  He made a combined application for leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  Migrant  under  the
    points-based system on 31st July 2015 and this application was  refused
    on 17th March  2015,  and  it  is  this  decision  that  the  Appellant
    challenged before the Tribunal of Judge Pacey.

The Judge's Determination

 3. At the hearing before Judge Pacey on 14th August  2015,  the  Appellant
    was not in attendance.  Nor, was an explanation for his failure  to  do
    so.  Nor indeed, was there any other person on his behalf in attendance
    before the appeal pending before the Tribunal.   In  a  letter  of  6th
    August 2015, the solicitors acting for the Appellant stated  that  they
    were no longer instructed (see paragraph 3).   The  Presenting  Officer
    relied upon the reasons for the refusal (paragraph 4).

 4. The judge observed that the Appellant had been assigned a  Confirmation
    of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) to  Docklands  College,  but  when  the
    register was checked on 17th March 2015, the college was not listed  as
    a Tier 4 Sponsor at that date.  The application could not succeed under
    the points-based system because 30 points under Appendix A could not be
    awarded (see paragraph 5).  The  grounds  stated  that  the  Respondent
    should have considered whether the college was properly  registered  at
    the date of the application  and  also  the  grounds  stated  that  the
    Appellant had 60 days to change the  college  in  accordance  with  the
    principles in Thakur [2011] UKUT 00151.

 5. The judge went on to say that there was no evidence before the Tribunal
    that there was a valid CAS in place at the  date  of  the  application.
    The judge also held that even if that had been the case,

         "that would have made no material difference because  it  is  clear
         that even if the relevant requirements were  satisfied  as  at  the
         date of the application there was no valid CAS or Sponsor when  the
         register was checked, on 17th March 2015, and that would inevitably
         have led to curtailment of any leave" (paragraph 7).

 6. Importantly, the judge observed that, "the Appellant was given 60  days
    to make a fresh application.  There is no evidence or  contention  that
    has done so" (paragraph 7).

 7. Finally, the judge held that, "no human rights matters are expressly or
    by reasonable implication referred to by or on behalf of the Appellant"
    (paragraph 8).

 8. The appeal was dismissed.

 9. The Grounds of Appeal state that the judge had failed to have regard to
    Article 8 considerations with respect to the Appellant's private  life.



10. On 17th December 2015, permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis
    that it was arguable (albeit only just) that the judge erred in finding
    that Article 8 was not referred to because it was pleaded in the ground
    before the Tribunal.  In granting permission, the  Tribunal  also  held
    that "it might well be the case Article 8 was  of  limited  utility  in
    this appeal in any event, but nonetheless it is arguable that a  Ground
    of Appeal was raised before the Tribunal and that the judge  fell  into
    error in finding that it was not".

11. On 30th December 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered by the Respondent
    with reliance placed upon the case of Patel [2013]  UKSC  72,  and  the
    principle therein that, "the opportunity for  a  promising  student  to
    complete his course in  this  country,  however  desirable  in  general
    terms, is not in  itself  a  right  protected  under  Article  8"  (see
    paragraph 3).

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on  24th  June  2016,  the  Appellant  was  in
    attendance with two other people who sat at the back of the  courtroom.
    The Appellant, who spoke in English, did not appear to  have  read  the
    determination of Judge Pacey, against which this appeal was  lodged  in
    this Upper Tribunal,  but  handed  up  a  bundle  of  documents,  which
    contained  original  educational  certificates,  as  evidence  of   his
    educational attainments in the UK, together with a letter  setting  out
    the narrative of his educational pursuits in this country.  During  the
    course of the submissions that the Appellant made, I allowed him to  be
    assisted by the gentlemen at the back of the courtroom with respect  to
    the information provided for the Tribunal.

13. In a nutshell, what the Appellant stated  was  that  he  had  attempted
    during the 60 day period of  grace  that  was  given  to  him  to  find
    registration at another college, but even after having paid  �4,500  at
    various colleges, those colleges were then taken off  the  register  by
    the Respondent authority.  He submitted that he had spent over  �14,000
    in the UK attempting to get qualifications at three separate  colleges.
    He said that it was not  a  matter  that  was  within  his  control  if
    colleges were taken off the officially approved registered  by  the  UK
    government.

14. The reasons that the colleges gave were that they did not want to  take
    on a student who had his leave to remain revoked.  The  Appellant  said
    that what he wanted today from this Tribunal was the grant  of  further
    leave to enable him to complete a Degree because he  had  already  done
    Level 4 and Level 5.

15. However, he could not say whether he had found  a  college.   In  fact,
    when this was put to him by the Tribunal, he said that he did not  have
    another college to go to as yet.

16. Ms Aboni, for her part, submitted that the Appellant had been given  60
    days in which to find another college.  The Appellant did not appear to
    realise that he was appealing the decision of Judge Pacey, rather  than
    any decision of the Respondent Home Office to issue  him  with  further
    leave or not to do so.  There was no error of law.  The decision  would
    have been the same.

17. In his reply the Appellant submitted that it was  not  his  fault  that
    colleges had their licences revoked.

No Error of Law

18. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of a material error of law.  It  is  true,  that  in
    circumstances where the Appellant  chose  not  to  attend  the  hearing
    before Judge Pacey, that the judge concluded  that,  "no  human  rights
    matters are expressly or by reasonable implication referred to by or on
    behalf  of  the  Appellant"  (paragraph  8).   However,  the  important
    question is what the judge would have meant by this.

19. One only needs to look at the Grounds of Appeal to see what  she  would
    have meant by this.  The sixth paragraph  of  these  short  Grounds  of
    Appeal state that "SOS refusal is contrary to  Appellant  rights  under
    Article 8 right to respect private life".  That is simply  a  formulaic
    statement.  It does not, as the judge  makes  clear,  expressly  or  by
    reasonable implication, refer to the manner in which the  human  rights
    are violated as alleged.

20.  Far  too  often,  such  formulaic  expressions  are  made,  and   left
    unparticularised in Grounds of Appeal, in the vain hope that they  will
    make a material difference to the  appeal  at  the  end,  when  nothing
    whatsoever is done to put any flesh on the bare bones  of  the  alleged
    violation.

21. For whatever reason, the Appellant chose  not  to  attend  the  hearing
    before Judge Pacey.  However, it was incumbent upon him, or  his  legal
    representatives, to explain how the Article 8 rights were violated.

22. This was especially the case given that the Supreme Court has stated in
    Patel [2013] UKSC 72 that the opportunity for a  student  "to  complete
    his course in this country" when raised in general  terms  "is  not  in
    itself a right protected under Article 8".  If that is the  case,  then
    without any further particular authorisation, there could not have been
    an error of law on the part of the judge.

Notice of Decision

23. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

24. No anonymity direction is made.
