For the Appellant:     Mr J Dhanji, instructed by Awan Legal Associates
For the Respondent:    Mrs Vidyadharan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant appeals, with permission, against the decision of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision of 13th November 2014.

 2. On 5th May 2014 the appellant made an application for  entry  clearance
    for settlement to join  her  husband  Mr  Khan.   Her  application  was
    refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1 of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules with  reference  to  Appendix  FM-SE.   It  was  noted  that  the
    appellant's sponsor was not exempt from the financial requirements  and
    therefore needed to provide  documents  specified  in  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Bank statements for six months were received but only 3  months
    of payslips were received.

 3. Contrary to the Rules the Entry Clearance Officer emphasised  that  the
    appellant had failed to submit her sponsor's wage  slips  corresponding
    with the bank statements submitted.  This  was  a  requirement  of  the
    Rules and consequently the Entry Clearance Officer refused the appeal.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appeal and challenge by way
    of permission to appeal was made on four grounds,

    (1) that the judge did not understand the evidence  given  in  relation
    to the missing payslips,

    (2) the judge did not give reasons for  his  finding  with  respect  to
    Appendix FM-SE(1)(k) (that where a  gross  income  cannot  be  properly
    evidenced,  the  net  amount  will  be  counted   towards   the   gross
    requirement).  The payslips sent demonstrated an approximate amount and
    a  chart  was  put  forward  by  Counsel  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    demonstrating payments and the respondent could extrapolate the figures
    to show the gross figure.

    (3) there was a failure to consider  Appendix  FM-SE  D  (the  decision
    maker may contact the appellant in the event of missing documents)

    (4) there was a failure to apply binding jurisprudence  in  respect  of
    Article 8

 5. At the hearing before me Mr Dhanji confirmed that he wished to  proceed
    on only  ground  2  above.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  granting
    permission instructing that with respect to ground 1, a contemporaneous
    note  by  counsel  of  the  proceedings  be  provided  and   none   was
    forthcoming.  This ground  was  abandoned.   Bearing  in  mind  Sultana
    [2014] UKUT 540 (IAC) he accepted there was no mileage in his  pursuing
    ground 3.  Similarly ground 4 was not pursued.

 6. Mr Duffy provided the relevant immigration rules  as  at  the  date  of
    decision.  Those rules state at FM-SE 1(a)(k)

    'Where the gross (pre-tax) amount of  any  income  cannot  be  properly
    evidenced, the net (post-tax) amount will be counted, including towards
    a gross income requirement'.

 7. Mr Duffy contended that there was no  reason  why  the  six  months  of
    payslips could  not  be  provided.   The  emphasis  on  the  rules  was
    'cannot'.  There was no indication, despite  evidence  being  suggested
    that the Royal Mail had lost documents, that the  appellant  could  not
    provided evidence of those payslips.   The  schedule  of  the  previous
    counsel  covering  the  bank  statement  payments  did  not  cover  the
    requisite period which in  fact  ran  from  24th  October  2014.   Bank
    statements from that date were provided and some of the  payslips  were
    provided.

 8. First, I am not persuaded that the  provision  within  the  Immigration
    Rules covers circumstances such as these. It  is  clear  that  payslips
    were available to the sponsor as he stated  in  evidence  that  further
    payslips had been provided albeit after the date  of  the  application.
    There was no indication that  the  sponsor  could  not  obtain  further
    payslips from his employer and indeed the  sponsor  had  provided  some
    payslips, albeit not all those required, at the  date  of  application.
    The particular requirement of FM-SE 1(a)(k) refers to the  gross  (pre-
    tax) amount of any income not being properly  evidenced  thus  allowing
    the net income can be counted. This is a general provision  which  does
    not remove the requirement of  the  provisions  at  FM-SE  2  (a)  with
    reference to payslips because it was not the case of the sponsor at the
    date of application that payslips could not  be  produced  merely  that
    some had been lost.

 9. Even if this were not the case the judge in  his  decision  states  [7]
    that

    'Mr Saini then introduced a separate argument to the effect that  where
    the gross income cannot be evidenced, net income  might  count  towards
    the requirements under the rules.  I do not accept his analysis of  the
    net pay position as coming anywhere near to making up or satisfying the
    financial requirements that had to be met by the appellant' [7].

10. As Mr Duffy stated the schedule itself  was  deficient  in  timing  but
    nonetheless the net amount to be calculated from the said schedule  was
    in fact only �8,642.08 and this  was  indeed  nowhere  near  enough  to
    satisfy the  gross  financial  requirement  of  �18,600.  There  is  no
    requirement for the Entry Clearance Officer to extrapolate and work out
    the gross income in the way suggested.  The  Immigration  Rules  states
    that it is the net (post tax amount) that would be counted towards  the
    gross income requirement; it does not state that the gross  amount  can
    be extrapolated from any established or accepted net income.

11. The reasoning is not expansive but adequate and there  is  no  material
    error of law and the decision shall stand.


Signed                                             Date 13th April 2016
