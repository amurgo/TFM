For the Appellant: Sponsor attends.
For the Respondent: Mr A Mc Vitie Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Appellant was born on 14 June 1993 and is a national of Pakistan.
3. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were  in
   the First-tier Tribunal.
4. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Thomas promulgated on 7 December 2016 which dismissed  the
   Appellant's appeal against the decision of the Respondent dated  25  June
   2016 to refuse her application for entry clearance as the spouse of a  UK
   citizen.
5. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons which were  in  essence  that
   the payslips produced by the Appellant to  establish  that  the  Sponsors
   earnings met the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM  as  there  were
   discrepancies between the figures in the payslips and  the  bank  credits
   and the employment letters did  not  contain  the  required  information.
   There was an ECM review dated  15.9.2016  which  conceded  that  clerical
   errors had been made with salary slips so  accepted  that  there  was  no
   deception and also conceded that the  employment  letters  contained  the
   mandatorily required information but noted that a payslip for  22.10.2015
   for �249.96 was not reflected in the Natwest bank statement.
The Judge's Decision
6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Thomas ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against the  Respondent's
   decision finding that the salary of �249.96  shown  on  a  payslip  dated
   22.10.2015 was not shown on the Natwest  bank  statement  for  22.10.2015
   having accepted the other concessions made. Given that the Appellant  did
   not meet the requirements of the Rules  the  financial  requirements  not
   being met there was no basis for a grant of leave outside the Rules.
7. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing:  that  the  Judge  had  overlooked
   that two statements were sent in respect of the Natwest: a saver  account
   and a current account and the payment in issue had been credited  to  the
   saver account.
8.  On 5.9.2017 Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds gave permission to appeal.
Discussion

9. At the hearing I indicated to Mr Mc Vitie that the Appellant  had  argued
   that the ECO did not raise the issue that was held against him because he
   had been examined both bank statements that had  been  submitted  by  the
   Appellant and was satisfied that all deposits were shown. I therefore  re
   examined the original Respondents bundle and  I  found  in  it  two  bank
   statements one of which related to a current account but the other was  a
   saver account. On 8.10.2015 the  saver  account  was  credited  with  the
   salary of �249.96. Ms Mc Vitie accepted that this second account had been
   overlooked by the Judge and therefore there was an error of law such that
   the decision should be set aside and remade.

10. I set aside the decision.

11. Mr Mc Vitie made no further submissions.

Remaking the decision

13. The Appellant appeals the decision of the Respondent on the basis  that
    the decision is unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

14. I have determined the issue on the basis of the questions posed by Lord
    Bingham in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27


Does the refusal amount to an interference by a public  authority  with  the
exercise of the applicant's right to respect for  his  private  (or  as  the
case may be) family life?


15. I am satisfied that the Appellant and  his  wife  have  a  family  life
    together and the refusal of entry clearance  is  an  interference  with
    their right to family life.


If  so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such  gravity  as
potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?


16. I am satisfied that refusal would have consequences of such gravity  as
    potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.


If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


17. I am satisfied that there is in place the legislative framework for the
    decision giving rise to the interference with Article 8 rights which is
    precise and accessible enough for the Appellant to regulate her conduct
    by reference to it.


If so, is such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being  of
the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection  of
health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedom  of
others?


18. The interference does have legitimate aims since it is  in  pursuit  of
    one of the legitimate aims set  out  in  Article  8  (2)  necessary  in
    pursuit  of  the  economic  well  being  of  the  country  through  the
    maintenance of the requirements of a policy of immigration control. The
    state has the right to control the entry  of  non  nationals  into  its
    territory and Article 8 does not mean that  an  individual  can  choose
    where she wishes to enjoy their private and family life.


If so, is such interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  public  end
sought to be achieved?


19. Consideration of the issue of  proportionality  is  'consideration  of
    "the public interest question" as defined by section  117A(3)  of  the
    2002 Act. I am therefore required by section 117A(2)(a) to have regard
    to the considerations listed in section 117B.


20. I take into account  that  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    controls is in the public interest. I note in this context  that  while
    this is not an appeal against the refusal under the  Immigration  Rules
    that if in fact the Appellant met the requirements of the Rules at  the
    time of the application then it was difficult to argue that the refusal
    was proportionate the  Rules  were  intended  to  promote  consistency,
    predictability and transparency in decision-making where  issues  under
    article 8 arose, and to clarify the policy  framework.  The  Rules  are
    said said to reflect the Government's and Parliament's view of how,  as
    a matter of public policy, the balance should  be  struck  between  the
    right to respect for  private  and  family  life  and  therefore  I  am
    satisfied that the issue of proportionality must be looked at  'through
    the lens of the Immigration Rules".


21. I am satisfied that the Appellant met the  requirements  of  the  Rules
    and that at the very least this should have been conceded at  the  time
    of the ECM review when  the  ECO  overlooked  that  the  Appellant  had
    submitted two bank statements which showed all of the  relevant  salary
    payments.


22. I note that no other issue was taken with the application made  by  the
    Appellant all other requirements of Appendix FM were met.


23. In determining whether  the  removal  would  be  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim of immigration  control  I  find  that  given  that  the
    Appellant met the requirements of immigration control  in  meeting  the
    requirements of the Rules that underpin that system  refusal  of  entry
    clearance is not proportionate.

24. I have considered the issue  of  anonymity  in  the  present  instance.
    Neither party has sought a direction. The Appellant is an adult and not
    a vulnerable person. I see no reason to  make  any  direction  in  this
    regard.

Conclusion


25. On the facts as established  in  this  appeal,  there  are  substantial
    grounds for believing that the  Appellant's  removal  would  result  in
    treatment in breach of ECHR.


Decision

12. The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds
