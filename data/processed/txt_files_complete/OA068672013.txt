Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Irwin Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    UK Sponsor attended


                   DETERMINATION FOLLOWING RESUMED HEARING

   1.  In  this  determination  I  will  refer  to  the  parties  using  the
      descriptions used before the First-Tier Tribunal.

   2. At a hearing on 29 July 2014, I decided that Judge of  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal Ghaffar sitting  at  Newport  in  January  2014  had  made  a
      material error of law in allowing the appellant's  appeal  "under  the
      rules" as explained in the determination by  Judge  Ghaffar  dated  22
      January 2014.  Because the judge had  allowed  the  appeal  under  the
      rules he specifically did not consider any "Article 8 appeal".

   3. For the reasons set out in my decision notice promulgated on 6  August
      2014, the decision of Judge Ghaffar fell to be set aside and needed to
      be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.  It was not possible to  proceed  to
      deal with the issues back in July and the matter was adjourned  to  be
      re-listed before me to enable a decision to be re-made  in  the  Upper
      Tribunal.

   4. In paragraph 12 of my decision notice I made certain  directions  with
      regard to the future conduct of the  hearing.   For  reasons  set  out
      below those directions have not been complied with by either party.

   5. Prior to the resumed hearing before me notification was received  from
      the appellant's representatives indicating that they  were  no  longer
      able to act.  I believe it is because of this that the  appellant  has
      not been able to comply with my previous directions.   No  explanation
      has been given by the respondent.

   6. The appellant's husband and UK Sponsor Mr Mahmood Azizi attended.   An
      Interpreter was present, but explained that Mr  Azizi's  language  was
      Dari and that they could understand each other.  Mr Azizi said that he
      couldn't afford to engage representatives.  Through the Interpreter  I
      explained  the  procedure  to  be  adopted.   Mr  Azizi  indicated  he
      understood and produced current P60 tax documents showing two  incomes
      each of ï¿½5,000 per annum.

   7. I invited Mr Azizi to explain anything  he  wished  me  to  take  into
      consideration regarding his wife's situation,  especially  so  far  as
      human rights were concerned.  He indicated she was very  worried.   He
      considered his wife was ill with mental  problems  caused  by  anxiety
      over the case.  He indicated it had been along time since he had  seen
      his wife.  He indicated he had nothing further to add.

   8. Mr Richards reminded me that I must look at the matter at the date  of
      the decision.  The appellant could not meet the Immigration  Rules  at
      that time.  There is nothing either exceptional nor  compelling  about
      the case.  Public interest demands effective immigration  control  and
      these can outweigh the rights of the  individual.   There  was  not  a
      breach of Article 8 and the appeal should be dismissed.

   9. I reserved my determination and  I  now  give  my  decision  with  the
      following reasons.

  10. For the reasons previously given the appellant  cannot  succeed  under
      the rules as at the date of the decision.  A concession had been given
      by the appellant's representatives during the hearing before the First-
      Tier Tribunal that the appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of
      Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Again  for  the   reasons
      previously  explained  paragraph  EX1  cannot  be   freestanding   and
      therefore the appellant cannot succeed.

  11. It is then appropriate to consider whether or not the appellant has  a
      freestanding  Article  8  appeal  or  whether,  as  contended  by  the
      respondent, the Immigration Rules themselves represent a complete code
      which embodies Article 8 consideration.  I have already in my  earlier
      decision notice mentioned the case of Gulshan [2013] UKUT  00640.   It
      is also appropriate that I take into account  R(MM)  Lebanon)  v  SSHD
      [2014] EWCA Civ 985 so far  as  it  relates  to  the  public  interest
      question.

  12. In short I  have  to  ask  myself  whether  or  not  this  appellant's
      situation is  either  exceptional  or  compelling  enough  to  warrant
      consideration under Article 8, rather than rely upon the complete code
      presented by this particular part of the Immigration Rules.

  13. In short it does not.  Nothing has been placed before  me  to  suggest
      that this appellant has anything exceptional or compelling so  far  as
      her case is concerned to outweigh public interest.  I acknowledge that
      she is separated from her husband and that  no  doubt  the  worry  and
      stress of the case has caused her anxiety.  However it appears she has
      family nearby and is  adequately  housed  and  maintained.   There  is
      nothing else that could  be  added  to  the  scales  in  weighing  the
      appellant's case against the public interest.

  14. For these reasons I conclude that there is no breach of Article 8  and
      the appellant's appeal both under the rules and in  respect  of  human
      rights is accordingly dismissed.

  15. No application was  made  before  me  with  regard  to  anonymity  and
      therefore no order or direction is made.

Decision

  16. All aspects of appeal dismissed.
