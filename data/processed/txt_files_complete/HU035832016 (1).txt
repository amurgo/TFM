Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tarlow (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Burnett (Counsel)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Respondent's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Andrew promulgated on 21st December 2016  in  which  she
    allowed the Appellant's appeal on human rights grounds under Section  6
    of the Human Rights Act 1998.

 2. The Judge in considering the appeal had to look at the Article 8 appeal
    through the lens of the Immigration Rules. The Respondent  argued  that
    the Appellant had utilised a  proxy  test  taker  when  undertaking  an
    English language test that he took at Watford.  The  Judge  found  that
    the Appellant did actually take the test and that  the  Respondent  was
    unable to succeed in showing  that  the  Appellant  was  dishonest  and
    therefore found that the suitability requirements and  the  eligibility
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  were  met,  that  he  had  a
    qualifying relationship under paragraph EX1 and  found  that  therefore
    the Appellant met the requirements of the Rules. He  then  went  on  to
    find that that greatly diluted the  public  interest  in  removing  the
    Appellant from the United Kingdom for the purposes  of  his  Article  8
    consideration of the appeal.

 3. At [18] the Judge then went on to consider the best  interests  of  the
    Appellant's child under Section 55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration  Act  2009  and  went  on   to   consider   the   statutory
    considerations listed at Section 117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.  That led him ultimately to find that the decision
    was disproportionate, given the fact he found that Section 117B(6)  was
    met and that there was a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
    qualifying child and that it would not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    child to leave the United Kingdom.  The  Judge  therefore  allowed  the
    appeal.

 4. The Respondent has now sought to appeal against that  decision.  Within
    the Grounds of Appeal the Respondent argues firstly that the Judge  has
    given inadequate and insufficient reasons for  his  findings  regarding
    whether or not the Appellant did cheat on his English language test. In
    the second Ground of Appeal it is argued that, although the Judge found
    that the Appellant did have a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
    a qualifying child and it would be unreasonable to expect the child  to
    leave the UK, that there  were  insufficient  reasons  given  for  that
    finding.  It was argued the British child  would  not  be  required  to
    leave and separation was justified in light of the Appellant's  conduct
    in obtaining his English language certificate by deception.

 5. I am grateful to the submissions made by both Mr Burnett of Counsel for
    the Claimant and Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting  Officer  for
    the Secretary of State.

 6. I note that permission to appeal in this case had been granted by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Froom on 14th June 2017, when he found that it  was
    arguable that the decision did not provide adequate reasons in  respect
    of why  the  judge  gave  less  weight  to  the  Respondent's  evidence
    regarding what was said to be an allegation of an ETS fraud.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Andrew  noted  that  at  [10]  that  at  the
    commencement of the hearing a  further  bundle  from  the  Respondent's
    representative was given to him. At [15] he noted the various documents
    filed by the Respondent and that he had considered the  guidance  given
    in SM and Qadir v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  (ETS,
    Evidence, Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229.

 8. However, there is in fact no analysis  within  the  decision  of  Judge
    Andrew of the actual evidence  referred  to  and  relied  upon  by  the
    Respondent.  The Respondent had filed statements from Peter  Millington
    and Rebecca Collings, a  statement  from  Matthew  Lister,  a  printout
    regarding what was said to be the invalidity  of  the  Appellant's  ETS
    TOEIC test and a report  from  Professor  Peter  French.  There  is  no
    analysis or consideration of the contents of the Respondent's  evidence
    and no proper explanation as to the weight to be attached to it by  the
    Judge.

 9. In paragraph 16 he gives his reasons for finding that the Appellant had
    taken the test and at that stage he says he looked at  the  Appellant's
    statement.  He says the Judge referred in some detail to an examination
    he took at paragraphs 8 to 49 of his statement.  He said the  Appellant
    was cross-examined by the Respondent's representative as to the  manner
    in which the exam was conducted and that whilst the Judge accepted that
    it was unusual for the Appellant to have been told by his  friend  that
    he was to come down and take a test  that  day,  and  that  he  had  no
    receipt for the ï¿½250 he paid to the college, the Judge said that he was
    satisfied  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  having  carefully
    considered  the  evidence  and  the  manner  in  which  the  test   was
    undertaken, the Appellant did actually take the test and the Respondent
    was unable to succeed in showing that the Appellant was dishonest.

10. I further note that at paragraph 22 that after having made that finding
    he accepted the Appellant had a good level  of  English  and  gave  his
    evidence in English and appeared to have a good  understanding  of  the
    questions that were put, but he noted that as far as Section  117B  was
    concerned it was a neutral matter to be placed in the  balance,  rather
    than a positive factor in favour of the Appellant.   But  in  terms  of
    consideration as to whether or not the eligibility criteria  were  met,
    that was not actually part of the findings in that in regard.

11. Clearly when making findings and giving reasons although Mr Burnett  is
    correct in saying that judgments do not need to be excessively long and
    a Judge is encouraged and recommended  to  give  concise  judgments,  a
    judgment still does have to give adequate  and  sufficient  reasons  so
    that the losing party knows effectively why they have lost and  it  can
    be seen that all of the relevant evidence has been taken into  account.



12. In this case regrettably in my judgment Judge Andrew has failed to give
    adequate and sufficient reasons for accepting the Appellant's  evidence
    and to explain his findings that the Appellant actually  did  take  the
    test and did not utilise a proxy test  taker.   There  is,  other  than
    stating he has considered the documents filed  by  the  Respondent,  no
    consideration as to actually what those statements were  or  what  they
    said and no analysis of that evidence.  Although the Judge has referred
    to the Appellant's statement and although  Mr  Burnett  is  correct  in
    saying the judge  did  not  need  to  read  out  the  entirety  of  the
    Appellant's statement, he has not actually quoted anything from  within
    that statement as to the evidence which he thought was  significant  in
    supporting the Appellant's contention that he actually took  the  test.
    Although he further goes on to say that he noted the  manner  in  which
    the Appellant was cross-examined, again there is nothing there in terms
    of any findings as to what  that  manner  was  or  what  the  Appellant
    actually said which led to the Appellant being credible.

13. It is unclear having read that judgment as to exactly what parts of the
    evidence the judge has really accepted  or  rejected  and  his  reasons
    therefore.  It is unclear to the losing party as to why they have lost.



14. In those circumstances the Judge has not complied with the duty to give
    adequate and sufficient reasons and that in my judgment does amount  to
    a material error of  law.  The  findings  as  to  whether  or  not  the
    Appellant did exercise a proxy  test  taker  and  whether  or  not  the
    eligibility requirements were  met  under  the  Rules  was  a  relevant
    consideration when considering the Article 8 case  viewed  through  the
    prism of the Immigration Rules. I am not in a position to say that  the
    decision would necessarily be the same had that error not been made and
    therefore I do find it is a material error of law.

15. That error also infects the findings regarding whether or not it  would
    be reasonable  to  expect  the  child  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    Following the Court of Appeal case of MA Pakistan [2016] EWCA Civ  705,
    the actions of the parents do  have  to  be  taken  into  account  when
    assessing whether or not it is reasonable to expect a  child  to  leave
    the UK and in  that  regard  if  there  is  an  error  in  the  Judge's
    explanation of the reasons given regarding the alleged deception,  that
    also affects the reasoning regarding the Article 8 assessment.

16. I therefore do set aside the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Andrew  in  its  entirety.  It  has   been   agreed   by   both   legal
    representatives that it is appropriate  in  those  circumstances  given
    that  the  decision  will  need  to  be  remade  and  the   Appellant's
    credibility reassessed that the matter is remitted back to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal for a rehearing de novo before  any  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew.   I  agree  entirely
    with that submission.


Notice of Decision

I therefore do set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Andrew,
the same disclosing a material error of law;
The appeal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  rehearing  de
novo before any First-tier Tribunal Judge  other  than  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Andrew;
No anonymity direction is made.


Signed                                  Date 5th August 2017
