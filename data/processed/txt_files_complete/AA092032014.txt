For the Appellant:     Mr A Mahmood (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Asjad, promulgated on 6th January 2015, following a hearing at  Sheldon
    Court Birmingham on 22nd December  2014.   In  the  determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, who  subsequently  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of Pakistan,  who  was  born  on  3rd
    January 1986.  She appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State, refusing her  application  for  asylum  dated  22nd
    October 2014, and for humanitarian protection.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that  her  family  are  at  risk  due  to  her
    father's activities against the Taliban, that she has a child  born  to
    her outside wedlock, and that her father's activities in the  UK  place
    them at risk of ill-treatment and persecution, such  that  they  cannot
    return back to Pakistan.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed that the  Appellant  had  consistently  changed  the
    basis of her claim such that it was extremely  difficult  to  know  the
    proper basis  of  her  claim  for  asylum.   In  her  Asylum  Screening
    Interview (ASI) she had explained (at 4.1) that,  "I  came  to  the  UK
    because my father's life was in danger from the religious extremists he
    has been living in the UK for the past ten years."  The Appellant  then
    arrived in the UK as a student with  entry  clearance  to  study.   She
    subsequently said that she had come  to  the  UK  for  the  purpose  of
    furthering her study.

 5. In her asylum interview, she states  that  the  Taliban  made  a  fatwa
    against her father stating that he  should  be  killed.   However,  her
    witness statement makes no reference to any of these events.

 6. In what is a thorough  and  meticulously  compiled  determination,  the
    judge recounts the evidence of the various witnesses who gave  evidence
    on the Appellant's behalf before concluding that:

         "I find that the Appellant has come  to  the  UK  for  the  express
         purpose of settling here.  She had no intention of studying in  the
         UK, her application for further leave to remain  was  refused,  and
         she was unsuccessful as a dependant on her  father's  asylum  claim
         (according to her own  evidence).   I  find  that  the  Appellant's
         asylum claim is fabricated and it is highly likely that her  father
         is complicit in this lie.  I accept that the Appellant has a  child
         - but I do not accept that this child puts the Appellant at risk of
         any harm in Pakistan.  Given  my  findings  about  the  Appellant's
         father, it is likely that the Appellant has the full support of her
         family.  If she were to return to Pakistan she would  be  protected
         by them and would not be put at risk."  (See paragraph 47)

 7. It is noteworthy here that in relation to the  Appellant's  claim  that
    she has a child born out of wedlock the refusal letter dealt with  this
    contention on the basis that,

         "There are inconsistencies in your account.  It is  noted  that  in
         your screening interview you have stated that you  became  pregnant
         and your fiancï¿½ left you (SI 4.2).  However, you made no mention of
         Mohammad Imran in your screening interview who you  claimed  to  be
         your partner in  your  Asylum  Interview  Record  (see  AIR  Q.55).
         Nevertheless, in your witness statement you claim  that  you  broke
         off the engagement, after which you became pregnant by another man,
         who has left you (see witness statement at pages 40 to  43).   [See
         paragraph 21 of the refusal letter]."

    The judge dealt with this particular  aspect  of  the  claim  with  the
    observation that,

         "I doubt that Mohammed Imran exists,  as  there  is  absolutely  no
         evidence apart from the Appellant's own account, to  show  that  he
         does.  Her account cannot relied upon as she has  repeatedly  given
         inconsistent evidence.   It  carried  little  or  no  weight"  (see
         paragraph 47).

 8. The judge went on to consider the Article 8 claim (see paragraphs 52 to
    56) and rejected this claim as well.

 9. The judge further gave express consideration to the best  interests  of
    the child (see paragraph 54) and gave due  attention  to  the  relevant
    case law and proceeded to reject this aspect of the claim as well.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application make  two  basic  criticisms.   First,  that
    there was an expert report from Dr Livia Holden which  was  before  the
    judge, but no real consideration was given to this expert report, which
    was essential given that part of the claim was in relation to  a  child
    being born out of  wedlock,  and  Dr  Holden  makes  reference  to  the
    cultural considerations which will place the Appellant at  considerable
    jeopardy were she to return to Pakistan, and yet  her  report  was  not
    considered.

11. Second, the judge's approach to  the  screening  interview  was  flawed
    because too much weight was placed upon  what  was  never  intended  by
    either party to be a full explanation for the reasons  for  the  asylum
    claim.

12. On 27th January 2015, permission to appeal was granted  on  both  these
    grounds.  It is important to note that  the  grant  of  permission  was
    subject to the significant observation by the judge that, "how material
    the error is will have to await the party's arguments, and will have to
    be assessed cumulatively with any error of law found in  the  light  of
    the first criticism."

13. On 6th February 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered.   First,  it  was
    said that the judge does expressly refer to the report at  paragraph  2
    of the determination and refers to the report by  Dr  Livia  Holden  in
    name.  It is also further said at  paragraph  12  that  the  judge  had
    considered  all  the  evidence  that  had  been  placed   before   her.
    Furthermore, at paragraph 51 of the  determination,  the  judge  states
    that she accepts the objective evidence about Pakistan.

14. Second, the determination is comprehensive and the  judge  conducted  a
    careful analysis  of  the  evidence  with  regard  to  credibility  and
    concluded that the Appellant was not  a  credible  witness.   In  these
    circumstances, "the expert report could only have had a material impact
    if the Appellant was found to be credible" (see paragraph 5).

Submissions

15. At the hearing before me on 14th January 2016, Mr Mahmood, appearing as
    Counsel on behalf of the Appellant,  made  the  following  submissions.
    First, he stated that the expert report  should  have  been  considered
    within the body of the determination.  This was particularly given that
    from page 83 onwards the report is detailed and expressly  targets  the
    various circumstances of the Appellant herself.  In particular, at page
    83 the judge observes that, "... the Appellant says this is a  cultural
    issue" and the expert then deals with what  the  cultural  implications
    are of the Appellant having had a  child  outside  wedlock.   What  the
    judge ought to have done, for the decision to be free  from  criticism,
    was to treat the expert report as an aide to her  findings.   Then  the
    judge could have said whether she disagreed with a particular aspect of
    it or not.  As it is, she has said nothing about the report at all.

16. Second, the Rule 24 response states that  the  judge  made  an  express
    reference to the report at paragraph 2 at the  outset.   However,  what
    the judge had done here was simply to set out  the  documentation  that
    was before her.  This does not mean to say that the expert  report  had
    actually been considered with any particularity.

17. Third, there is a possible criticism of the judge's  approach  in  that
    she launches into an analysis of the credibility of  the  witnesses  at
    the outset, without placing such criticism in the context of the expert
    report which highlights the cultural circumstances that  the  Appellant
    would face if she has to go back given her condition.

18. In relation to the second point upon which permission had been granted,
    namely, the screening interview, when the Appellant had been  asked  at
    4.2 of the screening interview, she had actually  said  that,  "...  my
    father arranged for me to be engaged to a man who was five years  older
    and already married before" and that she was not happy with this.  This
    meant that she had referred to the fact that there were difficulties in
    relation to her possible marriage to a person whom she did not want  to
    marry.

19. For his part, Mr Richards submitted that there  was  no  error  of  law
    whatsoever.  The judge did not mention the expert  report  because  the
    essential matter before the judge was that of the  credibility  of  the
    witnesses and of the Appellant, and having found that the evidence  was
    simply lacking in all credibility, the judge did not find it  necessary
    to look at the expert report in any great  detail  than  was  otherwise
    necessary.   There  is  nothing  in  the   report   which,   in   these
    circumstances, would have allowed for the appeal of the Appellant to be
    granted.  It would  be  otherwise  if  that  were  the  case.   In  the
    circumstances, there was no materiality to any error  that  might  have
    transpired.  In fact, if the Appellant's claim  was  a  good  claim  it
    would have been allowed without the expert report because she would  be
    able to show that she was at risk simply on  the  basis  of  the  facts
    found in her favour.

20. In reply, Mr Mahmood submitted that the  expert  report  needed  to  be
    assessed to assist the judge with the credibility findings.   It  ought
    not to be forgotten that at page 103 of the bundle and at paragraph  36
    and then at page 94 at paragraph 25, the  expert  had  dealt  with  the
    cultural aspects of the claim.  The judge herself made  a  decision  on
    the cultural aspects, but did so without any reference  to  the  expert
    report, and so this must at the very least be a material error of law.

No Error of Law

21. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  judge  does  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA [2007]) such that I should set aside that decision and re-make the
    decision.  I come  to  this  conclusion  notwithstanding  Mr  Mahmood's
    measured and carefully constructed submissions before me.   First,  the
    judge refers to the evidence that she has before her at the  outset  of
    the determination and expressly refers to "... an expert's report  from
    Dr Livia Holden" (paragraph 2).  At paragraph 12 of  the  determination
    she states that, "I have looked at the evidence  in  the  round  taking
    account of all the evidence both oral and written."  At paragraph 51 of
    the determination, she states that, "... for the sake of  completeness,
    I add that I accept the objective evidence about Pakistan."

22. However, in the same breath and the next sentence she also  immediately
    adds that,

         "But I take into account that  I  must  apply  to  the  Appellant's
         individual case.  Having  made  my  findings  about  this  case,  I
         determine that the objective evidence about Pakistan has no bearing
         on this Appellant's claim for international protection because I do
         not find it to be true" (paragraph 52).

23. What then are the reasons for the rejection of the  Appellant's  claim?
    These were set out very carefully by the judge at paragraph  47  (which
    has already been referred to above) where the judge states  that  there
    has been collusion  between  family  members,  and  in  particular  the
    father, in the Appellant putting forward a claim that can be  described
    as nothing short of a lie.  The judge not only dismisses the claim, but
    she also dismisses any suggestion that a man by the  name  of  Mohammed
    Imran exists who is the father of this child.

24. But most importantly, in the same paragraph,  the  judge  states  that,
    "... if she were to return to Pakistan she would be protected  by  them
    and would not be put at risk."  Any suggestion that the Appellant risks
    ill-treatment or persecution is simply untenable on  this  basis.   Not
    only is it rejected that the Appellant has borne a child the father  of
    whom is a man by the name of Mohammed Imran.

25. It is also said that the Appellant will have complete  protection  from
    family members, who have been complicit in her fabricated claim  before
    the UK authorities, if she were to be returned to Pakistan.   Added  to
    this, is the judge's very thoughtful statement that in  coming  to  her
    conclusions she has taken into  account  the  report  on  "...  refugee
    status determination and limits of memory" (see paragraph 50).

26. Second, as far as the screening interview  is  concerned,  whereas  the
    established jurisprudence plainly is that the  screening  interview  is
    simply the first step to the Appellant putting forward  the  nature  of
    his claim, which is then further elaborated upon  in  a  more  detailed
    Asylum Interview Record, it is not a  licence  for  suggesting  that  a
    party to an asylum claim can put forward a  particular  basis  for  the
    claim in the screening interview, and  then  put  forward  an  entirely
    different claim in the asylum interview, such as  to  completely  alter
    the basis of the protection claim that is being made.

27. In short, the way in which the claim has been put forward, rather  than
    assisting the Appellant, does her no credit whatsoever, because as  the
    judge makes clear at the outset of her determination, there  are  three
    different accounts that have been put forward, and none of them can  be
    believed.  What transpired before the Tribunal was an elaborate scheme,
    with the complicity of family  members,  to  raise  a  claim  that  was
    utterly lacking in any credibility whatsoever.   The  judge  was  fully
    entitled to come to the conclusions that she did.

28. The determination is detailed, thorough, and a complete answer  to  the
    claim made.  Neither the failure to give detailed attention to Dr Livia
    Holden's report, which  was  in  the  event  found  to  be  of  limited
    assistance given the findings of  the  judge  on  the  facts,  nor  the
    reliance upon the screening interview, which was taken out  of  context
    in the appeal subsequently before this Tribunal, deserve the  criticism
    that has  been  levied  against  them.   The  application  before  this
    Tribunal has no realistic prospect of success and I so hold.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity order is made.
