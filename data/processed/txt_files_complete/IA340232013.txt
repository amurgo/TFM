                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kelsey promulgated on 13 August 2014 which dismissed the
    Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on  15  November  1991  and  is  a  national  of
    Bangladesh.

 4. On 5 July 2012 the Appellant applied for leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom under Article 8 outside the Rules.

 5. On 5 August  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application and made directions for his  removal  under  s  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.  The  refusal  letter
    considered the Appellant's application by reference  to  Paragraph  276
    ADE of the Immigration Rules and also  considered  whether  there  were
    exceptional circumstances which might warrant a grant of leave  outside
    the Rules. The letter  gave  a  number  of  reasons  for  refusing  the
    application:

      a) Given that the Appellant had only been in the United Kingdom  since
         2012 he did not meet the requirements for leave on the basis of the
         length of time he had lived in the United Kingdom.

      b) Given the length of time he had lived in the United  Kingdom  there
         was no suggestion that he had lost all ties with Bangladesh.

      c) The family life that the Appellant enjoyed in  the  United  Kingdom
         with his adult family members did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM.

      d) The Appellant still had social and cultural ties to Bangladesh.

      e) The Appellant came to the United Kingdom on a  visitor's  visa  and
         had no expectation of being able to stay.

The Judge's Decision

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Kelsey  ("the  Judge")  dismissed   the   appeal   against   the
    Respondent's decision. The Judge found :

      a) At paragraph 17 the Judge identified the  burden  and  standard  of
         proof in Article 8 cases.

      b) At paragraph 18 the Judge identified that Appendix  FM  applied  to
         application made on or after 9 July 2012.

      c) He identified that the Appellant had lived in Bangladesh for  15  ï¿½
         years and in the United Kingdom for 2  years  before  he  made  the
         application subject of the current appeal.

      d) He found there was little evidence to  support  the  oral  evidence
         that he had heard.

      e) The Appellant's statement referred to various family members in the
         United Kingdom some of whom had  provided  supporting  letters  but
         only one attended court to give evidence.

      f) The Judge found there was no  evidence  that  the  Appellant  would
         struggle to survive on return to Bangladesh as he  did  not  accept
         that the Appellant had no relatives there.

      g) The Judge found that there was conflicting evidence  about  whether
         this mother still had a home in Bangladesh and that this undermined
         his claim that he would have no where to live.

      h) The Appellant's had come to the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor  and
         made it clear that he would return.

      i) The Judge did not find that the Appellant's brother  gave  credible
         evidence about the family home in Bangladesh.

 7. Grounds of appeal were lodged which in essence were that the Article  8
    assessment was inadequate and initially  permission  was  refused.  The
    application was renewed  and on 14 January 2015  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Southern gave permission to appeal stating that  the  Judge  said  only
    that the appeal under 'the Immigration Rules was dismissed' and that he
    was obliged to determine any matter raised as a ground of appeal and he
    had arguably failed to do so. However he concluded:

         "Not without hesitation I  will  grant  permission.  At  the  Upper
         Tribunal hearing the appellant is on notice that in the event  that
         such an error of law is established he will  need  to  satisfy  the
         Tribunal that the error was a material one."

 8. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Chowdhury on behalf  of  the
    Appellant that :

      a) He relied on his grounds of appeal.

      b) The Judge failed to carry out the balancing  exercise  as  required
         under Article 8.

      c) The fact that the Appellant was an adult did not mean that he could
         not enjoy family life with those members of  his  family  who  were
         living in the United Kingdom.

 9. On behalf of the Respondent  Mr Harrison submitted that :

      a) He relied on the Rule 24 response.

      b)  The  Judge  had  grave  concerns  about  the  reliability  of  the
         Appellant's evidence about his circumstances and family life.

      c) In the face of the evidence before him he carried out  an  analysis
         of the Appellant's circumstances and concluded that there  were  no
         circumstances that would make it unreasonable for the Appellant  to
         return to Bangladesh given that he had lived  there  for  the  vast
         majority of his life.

The Law

10. In relation to the issue of materiality of errors of law I have  looked
    at the recent Court of Appeal  decision in SSHD v  AJ  (Angola)  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 1636 that an error of law by the First-tier  Tribunal  may  be
    considered immaterial -

         " ... if it is clear that on the materials before the Tribunal  any
         rational Tribunal must have come to the same conclusion or if it is
         clear that, despite its failure to  refer  to  the  relevant  legal
         instruments, the Tribunal has in fact applied the test which it was
         supposed to apply according to those instruments."

Finding on Material Error

11. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

12. The Appellant in this case made an  application  for  leave  to  remain
    under Article 8 outside the Rules on 5 July 2012. I am  satisfied  that
    the Judge at paragraphs 16 and 17 correctly identified that Appendix FM
    applied to applications made on or after  9  July  2012.  He  correctly
    identified the burden and standard of proof in an Article 8  claim  and
    what the Appellant had to show to establish his case.

13. I am satisfied that in  dismissing  the  case  'under  the  Immigration
    Rules' this was a typographical error given that the Judge had  already
    identified  that  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph  276  ADE   applied   to
    application after 9 July 2012 and set out that Article 8 was the  issue
    in this case in paragraph 17.

14. In his findings at paragraphs 19 to 25 the Judge set out a analysis  of
    the Appellant's circumstances which  although  they  do  not  expressly
    refer to Article 8  and  would  have  benefited  from  a  more  focused
    identification of the questions set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 are in
    essence an analysis of all the issues that he would have addressed  had
    he followed Razgar. Indeed when asked to identify any factor  that  the
    Judge had failed to incorporate in his analysis that may have  affected
    his decision Mr Chowdhury  was  unable  to  do  so  only  referring  to
    evidence of the sale of the family property and his mothers  indefinite
    leave to remain which was not in fact evidence placed before the Judge.
    Thus I am satisfied that while the judge did not  explicitly  refer  to
    Article 8 as in AJ 'the Tribunal has in fact applied the test which  it
    was supposed to apply according to those instruments.'

15. Even if I were wrong about the Judge  having carried out what  amounted
    to an Article 8 assessment in substance if not in form I  am  satisfied
    that on the basis of the material before him had he carried out a  more
    structured analysis under Article 8 any tribunal would have come to the
    conclusion that this appeal should fail.

16. I find that in relation to the Appellant's private life in  the  United
    Kingdom the only error was in failing identify  a  number  of  relevant
    factors on the Respondent's side of the balancing exercise.  The  Judge
    failed to refer to section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014 which amended
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 by introducing  a  new
    Part 5A which contains sections 117A, 117B, 117D and 117D  and  applied
    to all appeals heard on or after 28 July 2014 irrespective of when  the
    application or immigration decision was made. This would have  required
    the Judge to take into account  in  the  balancing  exercise  that  the
    maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public interest
    and given that the Appellant could not meet  any  requirements  of  the
    Rules and had come to the United Kingdom only as a visitor this  was  a
    relevant issue.

17. The Judge was also obliged to take into  account  that  it  is  in  the
    public interest, and in particular in the  interests  of  the  economic
    well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who  seek  to  enter  or
    remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons
    who can speak English are less of a burden on taxpayers, and are better
    able to integrate into society. There was no evidence before the  Judge
    that the Appellant could speak English  although  he  claimed  that  he
    could. The Judge would also be  required  to  take  into  account  that
    little weight should be given to a private life established by a person
    at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.  In  this
    case the Appellant  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  visitor  and
    therefore had no expectation that he  would  be  allowed  to  stay  and
    therefore his status was precarious. Nor did the Appellant produce  any
    evidence to show that he would be self sufficient for while he  claimed
    he would be able to work there was no evidence of any skills or that he
    had worked while in Bangladesh.

18. I accept Mr Chowdhury's submission that there is no blanket  rule  that
    adult children ceased to have family life with a parent or other  close
    family members because they turn 18 but the evidence of the  nature  of
    his family life was both limited and, the Judge found,  unreliable.  In
    assessing the Appellant's family life in the UK he would of course have
    taken into account that although he claimed to have a number of  family
    members in the United Kingdom only one had attended to  give  evidence.
    The Appellant had brothers and sisters none of whom attended court  and
    his mother also failed to attend and the Judge was entitled  to  attach
    little weight  to  the  supporting  letters  provided.   There  was  no
    evidence before the  Judge  on  which  he  could  conclude  that  their
    relationship went beyond normal emotional ties particularly  given  the
    fact that the Appellant had remained in Bangladesh while  other  family
    members came to the United Kingdom to settle.  Thus arguably  it  would
    have been open to the Judge to conclude that he had no family  life  as
    defined by Article 8 on the basis of the evidence before him.

19. Even had he gone on to assess proportionality those other facts that he
    explicitly referred to in his decision would have inevitably  have  led
    to the conclusion that the decision to remove was  proportionate:  that
    the Appellant had lived the majority of his life in Bangladesh and that
    the Judge rejected his assertion that he  had  no  home  or  family  in
    Bangladesh and had not been wholly truthful about his circumstances.

CONCLUSION

20. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

21. The appeal is dismissed.
