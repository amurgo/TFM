Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Greer
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants who were respectively born on 30 December  1968  and  24
    August 2005 are citizens of Ukraine. They appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 10  October
    2017 to refuse to grant them residence cards as confirmation  of  their
    right to reside in the United Kingdom  as  family  members  of  an  EEA
    national exercising Treaty Rights in the United Kingdom. The First-tier
    Tribunal, in a decision promulgated on 18  May  2018,  dismissed  their
    appeals. The appellants now  appeal,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The first appellant is the wife of the sponsor, Mr  Kodok.  The  second
    appellant is their child. First appellant and sponsor are separated but
    remain legally married. At the initial hearing at Birmingham on 21 June
    2019, Mr Mills, who appeared for the Secretary of State, told  me  that
    the respondent did not oppose the appeal. The respondent  accepts  that
    the sponsor had not resided outside the United Kingdom for a period  of
    more than 12 months (as the judge had also found) and, in  consequence,
    his absence had not affected his right to permanent residence. He  told
    me that the respondent accepted that the sponsor had enjoyed a right of
    permanent residence from 2010 and  that,  by  operation  of  regulation
    15(1)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016,
    the appellants had themselves acquired permanent residence by  2015  by
    the operation of regulation 14. The judge's findings did not reach that
    same conclusion, despite the fact that the judge found that the sponsor
    had not lost his right to permanent residence on account of his absence
    from the United Kingdom [20] and acknowledged [18] that there had  been
    no need for the sponsor and first appellant to cohabit in order for the
    appellants to obtain rights of residence. The  judge's  conclusions  do
    not logically follow from her findings of fact.  In the  circumstances,
    I agree with the representatives that the judge erred in  law.  I  find
    that her decision should be set aside  and,  moreover,  that  I  should
    remake the decision allowing both appeals against the decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to deny the appellants residence cards.

Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 18 May 2018  are
    set aside. I have remade the decision. The appeals  of  the  appellants
    against the decision is of the respondent dated  10  October  2017  are
    allowed.
