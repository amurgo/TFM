                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, born on 7 April 1980. She came
      to the United Kingdom on 20th January 2008 with leave as a student
      until 28 February 2011. On the 4th February 2011 she applied for
      further leave which was granted until 30 April 2014. On the 28th April
      2014 a further application was made resulting in leave until 5
      September 2015. That leave was curtailed on 12 December 2014 so as to
      expire on 15 February 2015. That meant she had continuous leaves
      covering the entry on 20 January 2008 to 15th February 2015.


   2.  On 12 February 2015 she applied for leave to remain on the basis of
      her article 8 rights. This was refused on 25 March 2015.

   3. On 7 April 2015 she appealed that decision. Her appeal was withdrawn
      on 24 May 2016. On 9 June 2016 she applied for leave to remain again
      on the basis of her article 8 rights. This was refused on 14 October
      2016.

   4. Her appeal against that decision was heard by Judge of the First-tier
      Tribunal NMK Lawrence at Hatton Cross on 25 May 2018. In a decision
      promulgated on 22 June 2000 the appeal is dismissed. Permission to
      appeal that decision was granted on the basis inter alia it was
      arguable the judge should have adjourned the hearing because the
      appellant had indicated she was unwell. It was also arguable that the
      judge may not have applied section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971
      correctly.

Consideration.


   5. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge NMK Lawrence indicates that
      the appellant was represented by Counsel and there was no Home Office
      presenting officer. The appellant gave evidence as did a witness on
      her behalf. Counsel then began to make submissions. The appellant then
      indicated to her Counsel that she needed to take medication. The judge
      was made aware of this and told Counsel she could take her medication
      whilst he continued with his submissions. The appellant then stood up
      and her friends gathered around her and said that she was taking a
      seizure. The judge then rose and an ambulance was called. The Judge
      then returned and Counsel said the appellant had been taken to
      hospital. Counsel then sought an adjournment and the judge indicated
      this was unnecessary as all the evidence had been heard. Counsel then
      suggested that the appellant might have wanted to make contributions
      to his submissions. The judge then directed Counsel to put his
      submissions in writing which could include any comments from the
      appellant within 5 days.


The Upper Tribunal

   6. I have received an e mail from the appellant's representatives
      indicating that the appellant will not be attending nor will they.
      They include a skeleton argument for consideration. The skeleton
      argument on behalf of the appellant notes that when she made her
      application for leave to remain on 9 June 2016, having arrived on 20th
      January 2008, she had not been in the United Kingdom 10 years. This
      also was the case when the decision was made on the 14 October
      2016.However, by the time of the appeal, being the 25 May 2018, she
      had been here over 10 years. The skeleton argument claims the
      appellant has been continuously lawfully present in excess of 10 years
      by the time of hearing. This was because of section 3C leave.


   7. Ms J Isherwood contends that the appellant did not have section 3C
      leave throughout. Going through the chronology she accepts that the
      appellant had leave up until 24 May 2016 when her original appeal was
      withdrawn. I have seen a letter from the tribunal dated 24 May 2016
      giving the appellant notice by way of confirmation that she has
      withdrawn her appeal. Ms J Isherwood states that this breaks the
      continuity. The fact that she then put in a new application prevents
      her removal only and does not maintain continuity. In this respect the
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lawrence is wrong in stating at
      paragraph 23 that her section 3C leave continued. I have had regard to
      the wording of section 3C and am in agreement with Ms Isherwood's
      submission.

   8. I also see no material error of law in the judge not adjourning at the
      submission stage. At that stage the evidence had concluded. The
      appellant's representative contended that the appellant might wish to
      contribute to the submissions. The judge took the pragmatic measure of
      allowing the representative 5 days in which to lodge written
      submissions.

   9. The appeal was restricted to human rights considerations. There was no
      claim based upon any family life. In terms of the appellant's private
      life the proportionality of the decision was to be considered through
      the prism of the rules. The appellant in fact did not meet the rules
      in relation to 10 years lawful residence. She had not been here 10
      years at the time of application. In any event, as indicated the
      position by the time of hearing was that her leave had been broken by
      the withdrawal of the earlier appeal. The judge dealt adequately with
      her medical condition pointing out that treatment was available in
      Nigeria. There was no other basis for allowing the appeal. The judge
      had regard to section 117 B public interest considerations, noting the
      appellant had not been economically independent and a private life was
      established whilst the immigration status was precarious. The
      appellant did not meet

  10. I see nothing else in the grounds raised which would demonstrate a
      material error of law. Some of the grounds, such as the reference to
      the judge's comments about the presence of the ambulance as he was
      leaving, relate to peripheral matters.

   Decision

      No material error of law has been established in the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal NMK Lawrence. Consequently, that decision dismissing the
      appellant's appeal shall stand.
