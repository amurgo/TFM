Before:
                            Upper Tribunal Judge
                                John FREEMAN
Between:
                                shaukat Khan
                                                                   appellant
                                     and

                                  ABU DHABI

                                                                  respondent
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This appellant was granted permission to appeal the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal as follows:

       If it had simply been a question  of  the  explanation  for  the  Rs.
       241,000 deposit,  then  I  might  have  agreed  with  the  first-tier
       permission decision; but there  were  also  the  Rs.  345,000,  which
       clearly were a withdrawal, rather than a deposit. In my view this  is
       an E & R [2004] EWCA Civ 49 type case: unless there is  an  objection
       within the time set out in the attached letter, the  appeal  will  be
       allowed, with directions  for  a  fresh   before  another  first-tier
       judge.



    That decision was sent to the parties on 13 September, with copies of a
    notice requiring a response by the 27th. There has been none.

    Appeal allowed
    Fresh hearing, not before Judge Chohan
                               [pic]                                (a
