For the Appellant: Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: the respondent in person
                                   DETERMI
                             NATION AND REASONS

 1. Whilst this is an appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department, for  convenience  I  will  refer  to  the  parties  in  the
    determination as they appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant, a national of Japan, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to  issue  her
    with a permanent residence card under regulation 15 of the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the EEA Regulations). First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Agnew allowed the appeal and the Secretary of State
    now appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 3. The issue in this appeal is whether the appellant has demonstrated that
    she has acquired a  right  of  permanent  residence  in  the  UK  under
    regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations through residing with her husband,
    an  Austrian  national,  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations  for  a
    continuous period of five years.

 4. According to the respondent's summary of  the  appellant's  immigration
    history she entered the UK on 5 March 2007 with a family permit to join
    her husband and was issued with a  residence  card  in  September  2007
    which was valid until 25 September  2012.  She  applied  for  permanent
    residence on 14 January 2014.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted that the  appellant's  husband  was
    employed through an agency called Resource Solutions  from  March  2009
    and March 2013. She identified a gap in the evidence from  August  2009
    until August 2010 [7]. She said that there were  2  P60s  covering  the
    years 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 but  no  payslips  for  the  period  from
    August  2009  until  August  2010.   The  Judge  also  noted  that  the
    appellant's husband set up a consultancy company in 2011 and has worked
    since early 2012 for Barclays  Capital  as  a  consultant.   The  Judge
    considered all  of  the  evidence  and  said  that  she  considered  it
    necessary to establish only  that  the  appellant's  husband  has  been
    working either as an employee or as a self-employed person  in  the  UK
    over the five year period.

 6. The grounds of appeal contend that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  erred
    in failing to make  a  finding  on  a  material  matter,  that  is  the
    identified  gap  in  the  evidence  as  to  the  appellant's  husband's
    activities between August 2009 and 31 July 2010. The grounds of  appeal
    wrongly identify the issue for determination as whether the appellant's
    EEA national spouse had '5 years continuous employment in the UK'.  The
    question under regulation 15 of the  EEA  Regulations  is  whether  the
    appellant can demonstrate that she acquired a right of residence on the
    basis that her husband 'resided in' the UK  'in  accordance  with'  the
    Regulations for 'a continuous period of five years' and whether she has
    resided with him during that period in accordance with the Regulations.
    It is therefore continuous residence in the UK in accordance  with  the
    Regulations  rather  than   continuous   employment   which   must   be
    established. The relevant extracts of regulation 15 provide as follows;


         15. (1) The following persons shall acquire the right to reside  in
         the United Kingdom permanently-
         (a) an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom in
         accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period of five
         years;
         (b) a family member of an EEA national who is not himself an EEA
         national but who has resided in the United Kingdom with the EEA
         national in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous
         period of five years;
         ...

Error of Law

 7. The Judge had before her P60 end of year certificates for  2008-09  and
    2009-10. Both were issued by Newquay Professional Limited.  These  show
    that the appellant's husband was paid �18,337 in 2008-09 and  the  same
    amount in 2009-10. Mr Whitwell accepted that the P60s  show  employment
    during those years but submitted that they do not  establish  that  the
    appellant's husband was continuously employed during that period.

 8. However as identified above the appellant does not have  to  show  that
    her husband was continuously employed throughout the period. The nature
    of consultancy work may be that a person is not employed every day. The
    P60s along with the payslips show  that  the  appellant's  husband  was
    working through agencies up until he set up his own consultancy company
    in January 2011. The P60s show that he was  paid  a  reasonable  amount
    (�18,337) per year in 2008-09 and 2009-10. He did not have to show that
    he was working every day and it is reasonable to assume that those P60s
    represent  employment  throughout  most  of  those  years.  The   Judge
    considered all of this evidence in the  round  and  also  had  evidence
    before her that the appellant and her husband were living  together  in
    the form of Council Tax bills covering the whole period. I am satisfied
    that the Judge was entitled to attach weight to the P60s along with all
    of the other evidence and was entitled to conclude that  this  evidence
    demonstrated that the appellant's husband had been  employed  or  self-
    employed throughout the relevant period.

 9. I note that the Judge did not identify which  5  year  period  she  was
    looking at. The first P60 covers the period  from  March  2008.  It  is
    likely that the five year period began to run when  the  appellant  was
    admitted to the UK or  at  the  latest  when  she  was  issued  with  a
    residence card in September 2007. She  could  therefore  have  acquired
    permanent residence any time from five years later, in September  2012,
    provided her  husband  was  exercising  treaty  rights  throughout  the
    period. In this case, as the appellant's husband was still employed  or
    self-employed at the time of determination of the appeal in July  2014,
    the failure to identify the relevant five year period is not material.



Conclusion:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
