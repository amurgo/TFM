                                DETERMINATION


1.   On 21st November 2012 Mr Ubaoha's application for a residence  card  as
    the husband of an EEA national was turned down.  It  was  not  accepted
    that he was validly married to a French citizen, since the marriage was
    said to be a customary one, celebrated in Nigeria by  proxy  while  the
    couple were in the United Kingdom.  Nor was it  accepted  that  Hayette
    Issa-Filleul was employed at Saamtech Electronics, so as to make her  a
    'qualified person' in terms of reg. 6 of the EEA Regulations 2006.   An
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was  dismissed  'on  the  papers'  by
    Judge  Obhi,  who  was  satisfied  that  Hayette  Issa-Filleul  was   a
    'qualified person', but did not consider there to have  been  "a  valid
    proxy marriage".

2.    Judge Obhi made no mention of two other grounds which had been  raised
    in the skeleton argument proffered by DF Solicitors,  namely  that  the
    appeal could be allowed on the alternative basis that the  couple  were
    in a 'durable relationship' for the purposes  of  reg.  8  of  the  EEA
    Regulations, and that it would be a breach of Article 8 rights  if  the
    couple could not live together in this country.  The  omission  of  any
    reference to these grounds by Judge Obhi caused Designated Judge Barton
    to grant permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  when  the
    matter came before me today it  was  agreed  on  all  hands  that  this
    omission was an error of law.

3.   The case was adjourned, however, to await the outcome of  a  test  case
    on Nigerian proxy marriages, due to be heard on 5th June.  If it turned
    out that this appellant's marriage was valid, that would be the end  of
    the matter.   If  not,  the  alternative  contention  that  he  was  an
    'extended family member' of a Union citizen would need to be considered
    by the Upper Tribunal, as would the Article 8 argument.  To  that  end,
    the appeal was to be re-listed for hearing after the end of June,  with
    directions for DF Solicitors to file with the Tribunal,  and  serve  on
    the Specialist Appeals Team, witness statements by Ignatius Ubaoha  and
    Hayette Issa-Filleul, who would be expected to give oral  evidence,  as
    well as any further  documents  relevant  to  the  establishment  of  a
    'durable relationship' for the purposes of Community law.

4.   As it turned out, the 'test case' on 5th June was adjourned  until  the
    end of October, and the present case did not come back before me  until
    24th September.  That  morning,  Mr  Ubaoha  came  to  the  hearing  by
    himself.  His wife, he said, was feeling unwell, and could not  attend.
    No legal representative would be in attendance either.  Mr  Ubaoha  had
    just been to the office of Dorcas Falode, whom he was unable to pay for
    representation.  Accordingly, he  told  her  that  he  would  represent
    himself.   This  was  later  confirmed  in  a  fax  received  from   DF
    Solicitors.

5.   Miss Isherwood, who  was  now  representing  the  Secretary  of  State,
    handed up details about Ms Issa's employer, which she had  printed  off
    from the website of Companies House.  Saamtech Electronics,  a  private
    limited company, was dissolved on 3rd September 2013.   This  suggested
    that Ms Issa was  no  longer  exercising  Treaty  rights'.   Mr  Ubaoha
    responded that his wife was self-employed as  a  hairdresser,  and  had
    been while she was working for Saamtech.  Indeed, in a  statement  made
    by Ms Issa which was included  in  a  bundle  sent  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in Birmingham, but not copied to the  Home  Office,  she  said
    this :
             "I also run my own business as  a  freelance  hairstylist.   I
         have registered with HM Revenue & Customs as self  employed  and  I
         have provided evidence of payment of  Class  2  National  Insurance
         contribution with my husband's appeal bundle."

6.   No evidence of these Class 2 contributions  appears  actually  to  have
    been included in the Appellant's Bundle, and Mr  Ubaoha  had  no  other
    evidence with him to substantiate his assertion that his wife was now a
    'qualified person' under regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations  as  self-
    employed, rather than as a worker.  Very fairly,  Miss  Isherwood  took
    the view that  an  adjournment  would  be  needed,  in  order  for  the
    requisite  evidence  of  self-employment  to  be  provided.   A  French
    interpreter had been booked for today's  hearing,  in  the  expectation
    that Ms Issa  would  be  giving  evidence  on  the  issue  of  'durable
    relationship'.  That too  would  need  to  be  canvassed  at  the  next
    hearing, if it turned out that Ms Issa was currently exercising  Treaty
    rights but could not be considered as validly married to the appellant.
     Miss Isherwood and I being both available on 22nd November, that  date
    was chosen for the resumed hearing, at which  all  the  issues  arising
    from this appeal would finally have to be resolved.   Mr  Ubaoha  asked
    that DF Solicitors be kept on the record, in case they could be put  in
    funds for the next hearing.  Further directions were  given,  that  the
    appellant was to file  with  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  serve  on  the
    Presenting  Officers'  Unit,  any  documents  which  demonstrated  that
    Hayette Issa-Filleul was currently engaged in genuine  self-employment.



7.   On 20th November,  however,  DF  Solicitors  faxed  a  request  for  an
    adjournment, attaching a photocopy of a  one-way  ticket  for  a  coach
    departing that  night  from  Victoria  Coach  Station  to  Paris.   The
    passenger was named as Miss H. Issa, and according  to  the  solicitors
    she had been summoned urgently to her  mother's  bedside.   Her  mother
    resides in France, and had been suddenly taken ill.

8.   The request was granted, and the appeal was relisted  for  9th  January
    2014.  On 7th January, however, DF Solicitors faxed another request for
    an adjournment, saying that their client's wife was still in France, as
    her mother continued to be very ill and wanted her daughter  to  be  by
    her side.  The fax went astray at Field House, and was not  dealt  with
    before the day of the hearing, when the appellant attended  in  person.
    DF Solicitors confirmed that they had not been  instructed  to  attend,
    and that the appellant would be representing himself.

9.   I indicated to the appellant that the case could not be  adjourned  yet
    again.  There was no medical evidence to back up the  claim  that  Miss
    Issa's mother had been taken ill in France, or  to  explain  what  that
    illness was and why Miss Issa could not be spared for a single  day  to
    return to London and give the oral evidence which was necessary  for  a
    'durable relationship' to be established.  There was not even a witness
    statement, despite the direction for that given last  April.   I  could
    see no realistic prospect of Miss Issa making herself available  for  a
    hearing in the foreseeable future, and could not countenance a  further
    waste of public money in arranging  a  hearing  and  booking  a  French
    interpreter.

10.  I was able  to  indicate  that,  as  far  as  the  proxy  marriage  was
    concerned, the long-awaited test case was now on the pointed  of  being
    reported, and it meant that this appeal  was  bound  to  fail  on  that
    issue.  The purported registration of the  appellant's  marriage  by  a
    Customary Court in Ikeja is  of  no  legal  effect,  and  some  of  the
    essential ingredients of a valid  customary  marriage  ~  such  as  the
    consent of the  bride's  parents,  the  presence  of  members  of  both
    families at the wedding (even if the bride and groom are not  present),
    and the giving of a dowry by the groom's family to the bride's family ~
    have not been shown in the instant case.  The test case also now  makes
    it clear that the appellant  must  prove  that  the  Union  citizen  is
    entitled, under the law of the Member State of which she is a national,
    to contract a customary marriage by proxy and  to  have  that  marriage
    recognised in her own Member State.   There  is  no  proof  before  the
    Tribunal that such is the position under French law.

11.  As for the 'durable relationship' alternative, Miss  Isherwood  pointed
    out that, Saamtech Electronics having gone out of business,  Miss  Issa
    must now demonstrate that she is genuinely self-employed in order to be
    a 'qualified person' under the EEA regulations.  DF Solicitors had sent
    in a small bundle last November, which included two reminders  to  Miss
    Issa from HM Revenue & Customs, dated October 2012 and March 2013, that
    Class 2 National Insurance contributions, both  of  �68.90,  were  due.
    The appellant now produced  a  further  reminder  dated  October  2013,
    requesting �70.20 for the next six-month period.  But that is the  only
    documentary evidence of Miss Issa's self-employment.  We  do  not  know
    how much income it generated, although it would not appear to  be  much
    if the NI contributions are only around �70 per six months.  It may  be
    that Miss Issa's prolonged absence in France also affects her claim  to
    be a 'qualified person'.

12.  In any event, however, not enough evidence has been  adduced  to  prove
    that the appellant is in a durable relationship with a French national,
    even if she is exercising 'Treaty rights'.  The appeal therefore  falls
    to be dismissed.  No decision has been taken to remove  the  appellant,
    and it is open to him to make a fresh application for a residence card,
    if he can provide sufficient evidence in future that he is in a durable
    relationship with an EEA national who is a qualified person.


Decision

     The First-tier determination has been set aside, and  the  decision  on
    the appeal is to be re-made by  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  appeal  is
    dismissed.
