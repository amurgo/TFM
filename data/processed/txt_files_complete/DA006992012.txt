For the Appellant:     Mr M D Templeton, of Quinn Martin & Langan,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, a citizen of China, arrived illegally in the UK in 2006.
     He was later convicted of being concerned in supply of cannabis, money
    laundering offences, and possession of false documents with intent.  He
    was  sentenced  to  eight  years'  imprisonment  and  recommended   for
    deportation, with a further sentence of  25  months'  imprisonment  for
    failure to make payment of  a  confiscation  order  of  ï¿½125,000.   The
    Respondent on 22nd August 2012 made a deportation order against him  as
    a foreign criminal, for reasons explained in a decision dated 18th  and
    served on 20th September 2012.


 2. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, basing his  case  on
    his family life interests and those of his wife and  two  children.   A
    panel comprising Judge McGavin and Mrs Morton dismissed his  appeal  by
    determination  promulgated  on  24th  December  2012.  The   First-tier
    Tribunal did not accept that there had  been  significant  family  life
    until relatively recently.   One  reason  was  that  it  had  not  been
    explained why, if the Appellant was the biological father of the  older
    child, he had never been registered as such.

 3. Seeking permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,  the  Appellant's
    solicitors contended that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law  by  not
    accepting that family life existed from August 2006 until the  date  of
    the hearing.  The FTT  refused  permission  to  appeal.   The  UT  also
    refused permission, considering the proposed grounds to be no more than
    a disagreement with the findings reached by the panel.

 4. The Appellant petitioned the Court of Session for  judicial  review  of
    the UT's refusal of permission - [2014] CSOH 11.  In those proceedings,
    the Respondent accepted that the FTT erred in fact in  respect  of  the
    Appellant not having been registered as the father of the older  child,
    but argued that the error was "utterly unexceptional" and in any  event
    would have made no  difference  to  the  outcome  of  the  appeal  (see
    paragraphs 18 and 19 of  the  opinion  of  Lord  Jones).   Lord  Jones,
    however, in his opinion dated 29 January 2014, thought there  had  been
    such procedural irregularity that the Appellant did  not  have  a  fair
    hearing before the FTT, and reduced the decision of the UT.

 5. On 1st April 2014 the Vice President of the  Upper  Tribunal  made  the
    following decision:

      Permission is granted in light  of  the  decision  of  the  Court  of
         Session ... The parties are reminded that the UT's task is that set
         out in section 12 of the 2007 Act.

 6. In correspondence the solicitors for the Appellant asked the UT  simply
    to adopt the findings of Lord Jones and remit the case to be  heard  de
    novo by the FTT, without any  hearing  in  the  UT.   However,  the  UT
    pointed out that its statutory obligation is firstly to decide  whether
    there was any error of law and, if so, whether the decision of the  FTT
    requires to be set aside and remade.  Only in that event would  the  UT
    decide whether to remake the decision  itself  or  remit  to  the  FTT.
    There was no jurisdiction for the UT to accede to the  course  proposed
    by solicitors without error of law having been found.   The  case  then
    came before me.

 7. Mr Mullen indicated that he would take the line that the  FTT  made  no
    error of  law,  and  its  decision  ought  not  to  be  set  aside;  or
    alternatively, as the Appellant  had  not  sought  to  introduce  fresh
    evidence, the UT should proceed to substitute a fresh decision  on  the
    basis of the evidence already led.

 8. Mr Templeton pointed out that the Appellant had applied  to  rely  upon
    further and updating evidence, if the  FTT  decision  were  to  be  set
    aside.  As to error of law, Mr Templeton adopted  the  observations  of
    Lord Jones, in particular at paragraphs 6, 20 - 21  and  26.   He  said
    that the error into  which  the  FTT  had  fallen  was  clearly  not  a
    misunderstanding of one aspect of  the  evidence  with  no  significant
    impact on the outcome, as the Respondent had argued  in  the  Court  of
    Session,  but  an  error  which  contaminated  the  entire  Article   8
    assessment to such an extent that it  could  only  be  remedied  by  an
    entirely fresh hearing.  He pointed out that  the  Respondent  had  not
    sought to challenge Lord Jones' decision in the Inner House.

 9. Mr Mullen accepted that there had been  no  further  challenge  to  the
    decision of Lord Jones, but submitted that the  setting  aside  of  the
    refusal of permission simply opened the gateway to a challenge  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  It did not determine that there  been  error  of  law.
    The credibility of the relationship between the Appellant and the older
    child was not central to the outcome.  The family life from 2006  until
    the Appellant's release in 2012 had on any view been very limited.  The
    Appellant and his wife married only in 2011.  The family lived together
    only for a period of weeks, from the Appellant's release to the date of
    the FTT hearing.  His  immigration  and  criminal  history  was  highly
    adverse.   Family  life  was  established  only  on  a  precarious  and
    fragmented basis, and did not come  close  to  outweighing  the  public
    interest in his deportation.  The description by Lord Jones of the  FTT
    proceedings as a collapse of fair procedure went too  far.   There  had
    been no such collapse,  because  there  were  ample  other  reasons  to
    justify the outcome of the case.  The determination should stand.


10. Mr Templeton had nothing to add.


11. I indicated that in my view there had been an error of  law  such  that
    the case required to be reheard in the FTT.

12. There may of course be cases where Court reduces the refusal of a grant
    of permission, but nevertheless it is found that the UT should not  set
    aside the FTT  determination.   It  may  be  that  the  proportionality
    assessment in this case, once  fully  carried  out,  goes  against  the
    Appellant.  A finding of paternity of the  older  child  would  not  by
    itself enable him to succeed.  The Respondent did not accept before  me
    that the Appellant did not have a fair hearing in the FTT, but has  not
    elected to reclaim to the Inner House.  Given the observations of  Lord
    Jones, the determination of the FTT cannot safely stand.   It  must  be
    set aside and remade.   The  Appellant  has  applied  to  lead  further
    evidence,  and  the  fresh  decision  should  be   based   on   current
    circumstances.


13. No findings of the FTT are to stand.  Under section 12  (2)  (b)(i)  of
    the 2007 Act and Practice Statement  7.2,  the  nature  and  extent  of
    judicial fact-finding necessary for the decision to be remade  is  such
    that it is appropriate to remit the case to the FTT.   The  members  of
    the FTT chosen to reconsider the case are not to include Judge  McGavin
    or Mrs Morton.

14. (The FtT made no anonymity direction, and none was requested in the UT.
      The opinion of Lord Jones does not mention anonymisation, but  refers
    to the appellant as adopted herein.)
