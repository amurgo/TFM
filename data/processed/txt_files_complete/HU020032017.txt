               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In a decision dated 12 March 2019 Judge  Grubb  granted  permission  to
    the appellant to appeal the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    who dismissed her appeal in a decision promulgated on 5 April 2018.

2.   Judge Grubb indicated that he was of  the  provisional  view  that  the
    case should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal but  gave  ten  days
    for the parties to make any representations.  No  representations  have
    been received.  I agree entirely with the conclusions  of  Judge  Grubb
    and I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the  matter
    is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to reach a fresh decision on all
    issues with no findings preserved  from  the  original  decision.   The
    matter is to be re-listed at Taylor House.

2.   No anonymity direction is made.
