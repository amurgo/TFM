Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Palmer of Counsel, instructed by Barnes Harrild
                    & Dyer Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original Appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iran whose date of birth is [ ] 1991.  He
    states that he arrived in the United Kingdom  on  7  January  2009  and
    applied for asylum on the same day.  His asylum application was refused
    by the respondent on 31 July 2009.  The appellant appealed against that
    decision to the First-tier Tribunal.  His appeal was  dismissed  on  11
    November 2009.  His appeal rights were exhausted on 20 November 2009.

 3. On 31 January 2017  the  appellant  made  further  submissions  to  the
    respondent.  The appellant's claim was that he  would  be  at  risk  of
    persecution on return to Iran as a result of sur place activities  that
    he had been involved in in the United Kingdom - protesting against  the
    Iranian regime.  The  respondent  refused  the  appellant's  claim  for
    asylum on this basis on 7 February 2017.

    The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4.  The  appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  In a  decision  promulgated  on  24  April  2017  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge C A S O'Garro dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.   The
    First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant would not face a real risk
    of persecution if he were to be returned to Iran.   The  Tribunal  also
    dismissed the appellant's  appeal  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.

 5. The appellant applied for permission to appeal against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision.  On 24 May 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne
    granted the appellant permission to appeal.

    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The grounds of appeal assert that the First-tier Tribunal judge  failed
    to take into account the case of AB and  Others  (internet  activity  -
    state of evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT 00257 despite her  attention  being
    drawn to it.  It is asserted that the judge applied too high a standard
    of  proof  by  requiring  that  it  must  be  shown  that  the  Iranian
    authorities would be bound to find out about his sur place  activities.
    This is setting a threshold at the criminal standard.  It  is  asserted
    that the judge did not take into account the fact that if  the  Iranian
    authorities obtained the appellant's Facebook login and  password  then
    they would be privy to everything  that  he  has  put  on  his  account
    whatever the settings.  The judge therefore placed  significant  weight
    on an irrelevant factor, i.e. whether the Facebook account was  set  to
    public.

 7. Ground 2 asserts that the judge failed to take  into  account  relevant
    factors.   Reference  is  made  to  paragraph  31  of  the   First-tier
    Tribunal's decision where the judge said that  there  was  no  evidence
    before her that the authorities in Iran monitor  dissent  in  countries
    abroad.  This is factually wrong. There  was  substantial  evidence  of
    this before the judge in the country guidance case law and in the  four
    country expert reports from Dr Joff� and Dr  Kahkki.   It  is  asserted
    that the judge has failed to take into  consideration  the  appellant's
    ethnicity, i.e. that he is of Kurdish origin.  It  is  irrational  that
    the judge should refer and rely on case law on Eritrea and Zimbabwe  to
    approach the appellant's case when there  is  specific  case  law  that
    relates to Iran.  It is asserted that at paragraph 32 the judge  relies
    incorrectly on the case of YB (Eritrea) [2008] EWCA Civ 360.  The  more
    recent and country-specific case of AB and Others found that it is  not
    relevant if a person had used the internet  in  an  opportunistic  way.
    The authorities are not  concerned  with  a  person's  motivation.   By
    departing from the case of AB and Others without any explanation as  to
    why she has done so is an error.  It is asserted that at  no  point  in
    the determination does the judge  consider  any  of  the  comprehensive
    country evidence before her that was in the  appellant's  bundle.   The
    appellant relied on aspects of three different binding country guidance
    cases and authoritative reported Upper Tribunal decisions but the judge
    only considered one of these cases, at paragraph 39, and even then only
    considered an incomplete aspect of this  case,  failing  to  take  into
    account the appellant's ethnicity.

 8. Further and in the alternative the  appellant  distinguished  his  case
    from the country guidance case of SSH  and  HR  (illegal  exit:  failed
    asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC).  It was  asserted  that
    it was not argued in SSH and HR that a returnee would be at risk as  an
    ethnic Kurd.  However, this was argued in the  appellant's  case.   The
    judge failed to make a finding on this point and did not engage with or
    consider any of the evidence on this point.  The  appellant  relied  on
    substantial up-to-date  country  evidence  to  show  the  deteriorating
    country situation for ethnic Kurds. Risk factors such as returning from
    the West, Kurdish ethnicity, illegal exit and the sur place  activities
    would place the appellant at risk.

 9. The appellant applied to admit unreported determinations which indicate
    the approach the Tribunal is taking to cases involving  the  return  of
    ethnic Kurds.  An application was made orally at the hearing and is set
    out in the skeleton argument before the First-tier Tribunal.  The judge
    made no finding on this application.  This is  procedurally  unfair  in
    addition to a failure to consider material evidence or give reasons for
    refusing to do so.

10. In respect of Article 8 it is asserted that the  judge  has  failed  to
    consider the appellant's ethnicity and disability  in  the  context  of
    paragraph 276ADE.  The appellant has only had any education in  English
    which has taken many years due to  his  serious  cognitive  impairment.
    Reference is made to the case of TG and others [2015] UKUT 595 where it
    was conceded  by  the  respondent  that  there  were  very  significant
    obstacles to reintegration for Afghan Sikhs even  where  discrimination
    was not accepted  to  reach  the  threshold  of  persecution.   Similar
    arguments were advanced in respect of the appellant's case  in  respect
    of his ethnicity but the judge does not deal with  these  or  make  any
    findings on them.  The judge's  findings  on  Article  8  are  cursory,
    generic and do not demonstrate that the requisite anxious scrutiny  had
    been applied in a case where a disabled child  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom and eight years later there has been no attempt to remove  him,
    reliance is placed on EB (Kosovo) [2006] EWCA Civ 1713 in  the  context
    of the international law requirements to provide former  asylum-seeking
    children with a durable solution.

11. In oral submissions Mr Palmer submitted that the failure of  the  judge
    to take into account the unreported determinations amounts to an  error
    of law.  These determinations show that both the Upper Tribunal and the
    First-tier Tribunal on similar facts find  that  an  appellant  with  a
    similar profile to this appellant is at risk on  return  to  Iran.   He
    submitted that the question is - is that evidence relevant and does  it
    have persuasive value.  He submitted that an Upper Tribunal decision on
    an appellant with a similar profile is persuasive. The judge had failed
    to even mention the report of Dr Joff� and  had  made  no  findings  or
    indicated why she had rejected that  evidence.  The  skeleton  argument
    made specific reference to the country evidence.

12. He submitted that the judge had simply failed to apply the case  of  AB
    and Others when looking at the Facebook evidence.  In AB and Others the
    Upper Tribunal had found that on return a person will  be  investigated
    and will be asked for their Facebook password.  It is made  clear  that
    it  does  not  matter  if  the  Facebook  activity  is  pursued  in  an
    opportunistic way.  The question is will it give  rise  to  a  risk  on
    return.  The judge  has  failed  to  consider  this  case  when  making
    findings on the Facebook evidence.  He referred to the case of SSH  and
    HR, at paragraph 39, where the court found that illegal exit,  being  a
    failed asylum seeker together with Kurdish ethnicity  and  a  political
    profile puts a person at risk on return.  There is no reason  that  the
    judge ought to have considered cases on Eritrea and Zimbabwe which were
    irrelevant when there were  relevant  cases  on  Iran.   BA  (Iran)  BA
    (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on return)  Iran  CG  [2011]  UKUT  36
    (IAC) finds that the  Iranian  authorities  do  monitor  demonstrations
    outside of Iran to identify protesters.

13. Mr Whitwell referred to paragraph 23 of SSH and HR. He  submitted  that
    this case is the  authoritative  country  guidance  that  ought  to  be
    followed in this case.  He referred to AB and Others and submitted that
    this was not a country guidance case.  He referred to the head note and
    submitted that it is clear that the basis on which  this  decision  was
    reported is because  the  panel  wanted  the  evidence  that  had  been
    marshalled to  be  available  in  other  cases.   In  response  to  the
    assertion that the judge erred with respect to the findings  about  the
    public profile of the appellant's Facebook page he submitted that there
    was no evidence as to how Facebook does or does not work.  He  referred
    to paragraph 27 where the judge found that social  media  profiles  and
    pages  can  be  created  and  also  deleted  and  submitted  that   the
    information submitted in the new bundle by the appellant, at  page  59,
    confirms that  a  person  can  change  and  delete  their  profiles  on
    Facebook.  With regard to the standard of proof he submitted  that  the
    appellant was cherry-picking from paragraphs to  make  the  point.   He
    referred to paragraph 13 and paragraph 26 and submitted that the  judge
    was applying the correct standard of proof.  With regard  to  ground  2
    and the country guidance  background  evidence  he  submitted  that  in
    essence the judge was being asked to depart from the binding  authority
    of SSH and HR.  He submitted that SSH and HR had found  that  a  failed
    Kurdish asylum seeker with a low political  profile  would  not  be  at
    risk, which is what the appellant in this case is if the case is  taken
    at its highest.  He submitted that to depart from the country  guidance
    case there have to be  strong  compelling  reasons  and  evidence.   He
    referred to the practice statement regarding  unreported  decisions  at
    11.2  and  submitted  that  the  appellant  had  not   identified   any
    proposition not found in any reported determination  of  the  Tribunal.
    The fourteen unreported determinations cannot be sufficient  to  depart
    from the country guidance case.  He submitted that it would probably be
    possible to trawl unreported decisions and find an equal  number  where
    the appellant's claim had been dismissed on similar facts.

14. He submitted that the judge's consideration of the Eritrea and Zimbabwe
    cases relied on a point of  principle,  not  because  of  the  specific
    situation in either of those countries.  The principle derived from the
    authorities was that they recognised  that  some  asylum  seekers  make
    opportunistic attempts to raise a political profile.  In any  event  he
    submitted that the judge found  that  the  appellant  did  not  have  a
    significant profile and that the position of the appellant fits in with
    paragraph 33 of SSH and HR.

15. With regards to Article 8 he submitted that the judge  found  that  the
    appellant could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM  or  paragraph
    276ADE.  The judge gave adequate reasons.  With  regard  to  Article  8
    outside the Rules when taking into consideration Section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 there was nothing  further
    that the judge could have added.

16. In reply Mr Palmer submitted that the respondent's submission that  the
    AB and Others case is obiter is absurd.  He submitted that  this  is  a
    detailed decision which makes it clear on the basis of country evidence
    that a failed asylum seeker will be required to hand over his  Facebook
    login details.  With regard to the burden of proof  he  indicated  that
    the judge had made findings on an unlawful basis and that the appellant
    is not merely cherry-picking as there are several paragraphs  that  are
    quite clearly wrong in terms of statements of law.  The judge  was  not
    being asked to depart from  SSH.   Being  of  Kurdish  ethnicity  is  a
    relevant factor not taken into account in  SSH.   He  referred  to  the
    country guidance case of BA (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on return)
    Iran CG [2011] UKUT 36 (IAC) and  the  judgment  of  Lord  Cranston  at
    paragraph 65.  He submitted that these findings negate  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's findings in this case.

17. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

    Discussion

18. With regard to the standard of proof the judge set out in the following
    paragraphs:

         "18. I have borne in mind that the  appellant's  account  has  been
             given through interpreters and so meaning and intention can be
             lost even where no complaint is made  about  the  standard  of
             translation.  I have reminded myself of the  low  standard  of
             proof in asylum claims.

         ...

         37.  I am required to consider all the evidence in the round and in
             doing so I bear in mind that the appellant only has  to  prove
             his case to the low real risk standard...

         38.  ...  I have reminded myself of the seriousness of my  decision
             and the adverse consequences that are likely to follow if I am
             wrong but the burden is on the appellant to  prove  his  case,
             albeit to a low standard ..."

    The judge also set out at paragraph 13 that the standard of proof is  a
    reasonable degree of likelihood. I do not consider that when the  judge
    set out,  at  paragraph  28,  that  she  was  not  persuaded  that  the
    authorities in Iran were  bound  to  find  out  about  the  appellant's
    Facebook postings that she was applying a  higher  standard  of  proof.
    That statement has to be read in  light  of  the  preceding  paragraphs
    which deal with the evidence regarding the Facebook page.

19. With regard to the Facebook evidence the judge set out  from  paragraph
    26 onwards:

         "26. Although the appellant  has  produced  some  evidence  of  his
             Facebook activities, that evidence does not satisfy  that  his
             Facebook page was set to public which means anyone can  access
             his account to see all his postings and without clear evidence
             that his Facebook setting was set to 'public', I do not accept
             that the Iranian authorities would be aware of the appellant's
             criticism of their regime.

         27.  Further, whilst it is accepted that the  Facebook  page  shows
             the appellant's interest in  the  Kurdish  cause  and  may  be
             critical of the Iranian authorities, I am  aware  that  social
             media can be manipulated and  Facebook  pages  can  be  easily
             created and deleted.  Therefore without evidence as  to  when,
             if at all, the Facebook page  became  public,  I  will  attach
             minimum weight to those postings.

         28.  In essence, I am not persuaded that the authorities in Iran is
             bound to find out about the appellant's Facebook  postings  or
             that  he  has  submitted  any  evidence  that  supports   that
             proposition.

20. Where it has  not  been  shown  that  entries  on  a  Facebook  account
    represent a fundamentally held view, the judgment of the Supreme  Court
    in HJ (Iran) must be properly considered. Even if the Facebook  entries
    are not genuine this does not prevent a potential  persecutor  imputing
    an adverse profile which may lead to ill-treatment or  persecution.  It
    was accepted in HJ (Iran) that an individual cannot be expected to  lie
    to avoid persecution if what they are lying  about  is  something  that
    represents a fundamentally held belief or  political  opinion.  It  was
    recognised in HJ (Iran) that such a principle will only  apply  if  the
    material in question does represent a  credible  genuine  fundamentally
    held belief that forms part of a person's individual identity.  If  the
    material was created to enhance a bogus claim that has not  been  shown
    to represent a credibly held belief it is not afforded the same weight.



         36.  If the appellant holds deeply held political opinion, critical
             of the Iranian government then I accept that he  could  be  at
             real risk of serous ill-treatment on return.  The case depends
             entirely on whether or not I  believe  the  appellant's  claim
             about his political convictions.

         37.  I am required to consider all the evidence in the round and in
             doing so I bear in mind that the appellant only has  to  prove
             his case to the  low  real  risk  standard.   The  appellant's
             credibility is a factor I must take into account and I did not
             find the appellant to be a credible  witness.   The  appellant
             had no political profile that brought him to the  interest  of
             the authorities before he left Iran and he will  be  returning
             to Iran with no political profile that would bring him to  the
             interest of the authorities.

         38.  To conclude, I  find  nothing  in  this  appellant's  personal
             circumstances which gives me any reason to believe his  claim.
             ..

21. The judge clearly did not find the appellant to be  credible.  However,
    the finding that "he will  be  returning  to  Iran  with  no  political
    profile that would bring him to the attention of the authorities" falls
    short of a finding on the issue as to whether or not he  "holds  deeply
    held political opinion, critical of the Iranian government"  which  was
    accepted by the judge to give rise potentially to a real risk of serous
    ill-treatment on return. If the views expressed do not form part of  an
    expression of a fundamentally  held  belief  there  is  potentially  no
    restriction upon the appellant in denying the  existence  of  any  such
    entries or in expecting any entries  that  may  potentially  cause  him
    difficulties from being deleted by him. The appellant had not  provided
    any evidence to  show  the  Iranian  authorities  had  the  ability  to
    establish the nature of information deleted from a Facebook account  in
    this way. However, as set out above the judge has not  made  a  finding
    with regard to whether or not the appellant has deeply  held  political
    opinions.

22. There is a further issue upon which the judge failed to make a finding.
    As recorded at paragraph 25 by the judge:

         "Ms Blair in her submissions said that  the  appellant's  claim  is
         mainly that on return he will  be  asked  for  his  Facebook  login
         details which would expose his political activities and  place  him
         at risk of persecution and that due to his disability (it is not in
         dispute that the appellant is learning disabled), he is at risk  of
         incriminating himself."

23. As argued in the grounds of appeal the issue concerning risk on  return
    in this particular appellant's case is not simply whether  or  not  the
    Iranian authorities would find out about the postings on Facebook as  a
    result of them being public because if the Iranian authorities obtained
    the appellant's Facebook login and password then they would be privy to
    everything that he has put on his account whatever  the  settings.  The
    judge has not made any findings on whether or not the appellant  is  at
    risk of self-incrimination as a result  of  his  learning  disabilities
    which is to be considered in light  of  the  likelihood  of  his  being
    subject to any interest on return. The judge did consider the  risk  on
    return with regard to the monitoring of political activities in the  UK
    in respect of the appellant's claim to have attended demonstrations:




         35.   The  appellant  before  me  has  submitted  no  evidence   of
         significant political activity in the United Kingdom which  I  find
         would bring him to the attention of the Iranian authorities if they
         were monitoring overseas political activities.

         ...

         39.  The most recent country guidance in SSH and HR (illegal  exit:
             failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 provides:-

                  'An Iranian male in respect of whom  no  adverse  interest
             has previously been manifested by the Iranian State  does  not
             face a real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights
             on return to Iran on account of  having  left  Iran  illegally
             and/or being a failed asylum seeker.  No such risk  exists  at
             the time of questioning on return to Iran nor after the  facts
             (i.e. of illegal exit and being a failed asylum  seeker)  have
             been established.  In particular, there is not a real risk  of
             prosecution leading to imprisonment




24. SSH and HR is the authoritative country guidance case and the judge was
    correct to take it into account and to follow  it  when  assessing  the
    risk on return. The finding set out above is one that was open  to  the
    judge in respect of the risk arising as a result of the  monitoring  of
    activities in the UK and in respect of the illegal  exit/failed  asylum
    seeker/Kurdish ethnicity claim but the judge  has  not  considered  the
    risk  to  the  appellant  specifically  arising  as  a  result  of  the
    likelihood of questioning on return and  the  impact  of  his  learning
    disability on potential self-incrimination.

25. I do not accept Mr Whitwell's submission that the guidance  in  the  AB
    and Others case is to  be  considered  as  obiter.  It  is  a  reported
    decision of the Upper Tribunal. First-tier Tribunal judges are expected
    to follow the law set out in reported cases.  It  might  be  that  this
    submission was overstated and a reference to the common law doctrine of
    judicial precedent not applying  was  intended.  At  the  headnote  (as
    referred to by Mr Whitwell) the Upper Tribunal stated:

             "The material put before  the  tribunal  did  not  disclose  a
         sufficient evidential basis for giving country  or  other  guidance
         upon what, reliably, can be expected in terms of the  reception  in
         Iran for those returning otherwise than with a  "regular"  passport
         in relation to whom interest may be excited  from  the  authorities
         into internet activity as might be revealed by  an  examination  of
         blogging  activity   or   a   Facebook   account.   However,   this
         determination is reported so that the evidence  considered  by  the
         Upper Tribunal is available in the public domain"

26. However, the Upper Tribunal also stated at paragraph 3:

         3.    As well as determining the three separate  appeals  that  are
             before us we have endeavoured to give general  guidance  on  a
             range of related issues.

27. AB and Others was  considered, briefly, in SSH and HR at paragraph 11:

         ... In AB & Others (internet activity -  state  of  evidence)  Iran
         [2015] UKUT 00257 (IAC), there is reference at paragraph 457 to the
         act of returning someone creating a "pinch point" so that returnees
         are brought into direct contact with the authorities  in  Iran  who
         have both the time  and  inclination  to  interrogate  them.   That
         however was in the context of people who had  engaged  in  internet
         activity, and it is relevant to note also that at paragraph 470 the
         Tribunal said that a person  who  is  returning  to  Iran  after  a
         reasonably short period of time on  an  ordinary  passport,  having
         left illegally, would almost certainly not attract  any  particular
         attention at all.  It went on to say at paragraph 471 that where  a
         person's leave to remain had lapsed and they might be travelling on
         a special passport there would be enhanced interest  and  the  more
         active they had been the  more  likely  the  authorities'  interest
         could lead to persecution.  That is essentially  a  comment  rather
         than evidence, and though it agrees with what is said by Dr Kakhki,
         it takes matters no further in our view as  to  the  risk  of  ill-
         treatment on return during a period of questioning.  In  particular
         as it cites no evidence to support the view expressed, and also  it
         is a remark made in the context of evaluating risk  on  account  of
         blogging activities, and the reference to 'more active'  would  not
         be applicable to a person with no relevant profile.

28. In AB and  Others  the  Upper  Tribunal  endeavoured  to  give  general
    guidance. Under the heading "In  Summary"  the  Upper  Tribunal,  inter
    alia, set out:

         467. The mere fact of being in the United Kingdom for  a  prolonged
         period does not lead  to  persecution.   However  it  may  lead  to
         scrutiny and there is clear evidence that  some  people  are  asked
         about their internet activity and particularly for  their  Facebook
         password.  The act of returning someone creates a "pinch point"  so
         that a person is brought into direct contact with  the  authorities
         in Iran who have both the time and inclination to interrogate them.
          We think it likely that they will be asked  about  their  internet
         activity and likely if they have any internet activity for that  to
         be exposed and if it is less than flattering of the  government  to
         lead to at the very least a real risk of persecution.

         ...

         470 The main concern is the pinch point of return.   A  person  who
         was returning to Iran after a reasonably short period of time on an
         ordinary passport having left Iran illegally would almost certainly
         not attract any particular attention  at  all  and  for  the  small
         number of people who would be returning  on  an  ordinary  passport
         having left lawfully we do not think that there would be  any  risk
         to them at all.

         471 However, as might more frequently be the case, where a person's
         leave to remain had lapsed and who might be travelling on a special
         passport, there would be enhanced interest. The  more  active  they
         had been the more likely the authorities' interest  could  lead  to
         persecution.

         472 The mere fact that a person, if extremely discrete, blogged  in
         the United Kingdom would not mean they would  necessarily  come  to
         the attention of the authorities in Iran.  However, if there was  a
         lapse of discretion they could face hostile interrogation on return
         which might expose them to risk. The more active a person had  been
         on the internet the greater the risk.  It  is  not  relevant  if  a
         person  had  used  the  internet  in  an  opportunistic  way.   The
         authorities are not concerned with a person's  motivation.  However
         in cases in which they have taken an interest  claiming  asylum  is
         viewed negatively. This may not of itself be sufficient to lead  to
         persecution but it may enhance the risk.

29. The First-tier Tribunal judge has not  considered  whether  or  not  on
    return the appellant is likely to be questioned and if questioned about
    his internet activity would give his Facebook details and password  and
    thereby reveal the entries he had made and the photographs  posted.  In
    this case the appellant would be returning  to  Iran  after  a  lengthy
    absence (over 8 years). As indicated in AB and Others the main  concern
    is the 'pinch point' of return. The medical reports indicate  that  the
    appellant has an IQ of 55 and meets the  criteria  of  severe  learning
    difficulties. The judge stated that it was "accepted that the  Facebook
    page shows the appellant's interest in the Kurdish  cause  and  may  be
    critical of the Iranian authorities". The respondent accepted that  the
    appellant had used social media to air his political views.

30. The judge's failure to  consider  appropriately  the  case  of  AB  and
    Others, to make findings in respect  of  whether  the  appellant  holds
    deeply held political opinions and  the  specific  risk  arising  as  a
    result of his learning disabilities that he would divulge his  Facebook
    details and activity amount to  material  errors  of  law.  I  set  the
    decision aside pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007 ('TCEA').

    Re-Making the Decision

31. I considered the evidence and decided that I can re-make  the  decision
    myself notwithstanding the fact that there is no  fact  finding  as  to
    whether or not the appellant actually holds any real political  opinion
    critical of the Iranian authorities.

32. As set out as the main concern in respect of internet  activity  in  AB
    and Others is that there is a pinch point on return. In SSH and HR  the
    Upper Tribunal held:

              22. ...We see force in what Mr Drabble says in  this  regard.
         The evidence overall does suggest that  people  are  likely  to  be
         questioned  rather  than  there  being   an   entire   absence   of
         questioning.  In this regard among other things Mr Drabble  pointed
         to the Austrian Red Cross Iran COI compilation  of  September  2013
         and in particular at pages 141 to 142 of the  bundle   prepared  in
         support of HR's case which contains the reference  from  the  Swiss
         Refugee Council to  which  we  have  referred  above  the  (retired
         Supreme Court) judge stating  that  returning  asylum  seekers  are
         placed in detention for several days until the police had  verified
         they had not engaged in any political activities, after which  they
         are released.

         23.  This has to be seen, as with all these pieces of evidence,  in
         the context of the evidence overall.  In our view the evidence does
         not establish that  a  failed  asylum  seeker  who  had  left  Iran
         illegally would be subjected on return to a period of detention  or
         questioning such that there is  a  real  risk  of  Article  3  ill-
         treatment.  The evidence in our view shows no more than  that  they
         will be questioned, and that if there are any  particular  concerns
         arising from their previous activities either in  Iran  or  in  the
         United Kingdom or whichever country they are  returned  from,  then
         there would  be  a  risk  of  further  questioning,  detention  and
         potential ill-treatment...

33. It is highly likely that after an 8+ year absence the appellant will be
    questioned. He claims to have left Iran illegally and  he  has  claimed
    asylum in the UK. He is of Kurdish ethnicity.  None  of  these  factors
    alone or combined would give rise to a real risk of persecution or  ill
    treatment.

34. As described in AB and  Others  these  factors  may  give  rise  to  an
    enhanced risk of interest on return and in SSH and HR it was considered
    that an appellant's Kurdish ethnicity might be an  exacerbating  factor
    if otherwise of interest (see paragraph 34).

35. As set out in AB and Others there is clear evidence  that  some  people
    are asked about their internet  activity  and  particularly  for  their
    Facebook password.  "We think it likely that they will be  asked  about
    their internet activity and likely if they have any  internet  activity
    for that to be exposed and  if  it  is  less  than  flattering  of  the
    government to lead to at the very least a  real  risk  of  persecution"
    (paragraph 467).

36. The medical report indicates that  the  appellant  will  have  problems
    understanding complex questions. Given the appellant's severe  learning
    difficulties (whether or not he  in  fact  holds  a  political  opinion
    critical of the Iranian authorities) it is highly likely that he  would
    reveal  his  Facebook  details  and  password  under  questioning.  The
    activity on his Facebook page would be exposed. It is overtly  critical
    of the authorities and therefore the appellant would be at a real  risk
    of persecution. There is an aspect to the appellant's account  that  is
    troubling. He has a severe learning disability and yet  has  manged  to
    open a Facebook account and is able to use the social  medium  to  post
    criticisms  of  the  Iranian  authorities.  He  also  claimed   to   be
    illiterate. His learning disability has been accepted by the judge  and
    has not been disputed by the  respondent.  It  is  possible  that  this
    activity has been engaged in purely to create a false claim  either  by
    the appellant or on his behalf. However, as set out in AB and Others it
    is not relevant if a person had used the internet in  an  opportunistic
    way  because  the  authorities  are  not  concerned  with  a   person's
    motivation.

37. Although I consider this case to be borderline there  is  a  real  risk
    that the appellant, because of his learning disabilities,  will  reveal
    his less than flattering Facebook activity when questioned on return to
    Iran. There is therefore a real risk of persecution  if  the  appellant
    were to be returned to Iran.
