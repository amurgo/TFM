Solicitors)


                    RESUMED HEARING DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This matter comes before me as a resumed hearing following  a  decision
    on 20 May 2015 that there was a material error of law made by the First-
    tier Tribunal (FTT).  As this matter involves minors an anonymity order
    has been made.



Summary

2.   The first and second  Claimants  entered  the  UK  in  August  2013  as
    visitors to see their husband/father sponsor, a British  citizen.   The
    first Claimant had another child V, born in the UK, a  British  citizen
    by birth and as a result of his father having British citizenship.  The
    Claimants applied for a variation  of  leave,  which  was  refused  and
    removal decisions made.  They  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality Immigration & Asylum Act 2002 on  Article  8  grounds  with
    reference to Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE and outside of the Rules.
     The First-tier Tribunal heard the appeal on human rights grounds,  and
    although not raised in the grounds of appeal,  the  Zambrano  principle
    was relied on. At the time of the refusal  decision  the  Claimant  was
    pregnant. The child V was born on 26th April 2014. It was argued before
    the FTT that the removal of the first Claimant, who  was  breastfeeding
    V, would result in him having to  leave  the  UK  thereby  denying  his
    rights as a British citizen, contrary to EU Law, despite  the  presence
    of his British citizen father. The First-tier  Tribunal  accepted  this
    argument and allowed the first Claimant's appeal on immigration grounds
    under EU law and further allowed the  second  Claimant's  appeal  under
    Article 8 ECHR outside of the Rules.  It was conceded by the  Claimants
    that they could not meet the Immigration rules  under  Appendix  FM  as
    either a parent or partner.

Error of Law Decision

3.   In a decision and reasons dated 20 May 2015 the  Upper  Tribunal  found
    that the First-tier Tribunal did not engage with  the  second  limb  of
    Regulation 15A.

         "No finding of fact was made by the FTT that the first claimant was
         the primary carer of the British citizen child who was  a  babe  in
         arms and being breastfed at the  time  of  the  hearing,  but  this
         finding was inferred.  This is not challenged.  Following the  line
         adopted in the case law cited above, in particular  with  reference
         to Hines v Lambeth, I find that the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to
         consider whether there were other arrangements that could  be  made
         for the care of the baby, for example by his father to care for the
         child thus resulting in an ability to remain in the UK in the event
         of removal of his mother" [28].

4.   Directions were made for the resumed hearing.  At  the  start  of  this
    hearing I confirmed that the scope  of  the  hearing  was  to  consider
    Regulation 15A in relation to the first Claimant and the  care  of  the
    child V and Article 8 outside of the Rules in respect of the first  and
    second Claimants. It was  acknowledged  by  both  representatives  that
    there were in fact five children of the family; three children  entered
    the UK as visitors accompanied by their  father  on  15.11.2013.  Those
    children had no immigration status and were  overstayers,  their  visas
    ran out in June 2015 and no applications had been  made  to  regularise
    their stay.  Those children were not parties to the appeal.

Evidence of the Claimant

5.   The first Claimant  relied  on  her  witness  statement.  She  was  the
    primary carer for her child V.  If she were to leave the UK her husband
    would be forced to leave his job in order to look  after  V.   In  that
    event he would have to claim State benefits.  She carried out  all  the
    daily activities for V; changing nappies, bathing him etc. Her  husband
    did not know how to look after the child.  She  looked  after  all  the
    other children too. If she had to return even for a period of  60  days
    it would not be possible for V to remain with her husband  and  so  she
    would take him to Nigeria with her.

6.   In cross-examination she  confirmed  that  her  husband  had  no  other
    extended family in the UK other than his  second  wife  and  their  two
    children. Her husband provided money and food for the family.  She  was
    a full-time housewife/mother.  Her husband was self-employed as a  care
    worker for an agency, Apex.  He worked four to six hours on shifts  and
    the shifts were variable.  She clarified that he was  no  longer  self-
    employed and his company had closed down. If she  returned  to  Nigeria
    she would make an application for entry clearance as a spouse.  It  was
    put to her that as a responsible parent she  would  return  to  Nigeria
    with her son V.  She agreed. She had a stepsister living in the east of
    Nigeria. When previously living in Nigeria  her  late  mother  provided
    food and finance for her and the children, and  her  husband  paid  the
    rental (together with a contribution from her mother) for their flat in
    Lagos.  She explained that their eldest child, E, was at school in  the
    UK. No application had been made notwithstanding that his visa  expired
    on 27 July 2012.  She had been advised by her solicitors to wait  until
    her appeal was finished.  She confirmed that  all  four  children  were
    currently in receipt of UK State education and that she had given birth
    in the UK at an NHS hospital.  The family did  not  receive  any  State
    benefits. She would not be able to return to Nigeria for a short period
    in order to make an application as she did not know how long  it  would
    take, she could not manage in Nigeria and it would be difficult to care
    for V in Nigeria.  She had not discussed with her solicitors whether or
    not a spousal application would be successful.

Evidence of LK

7.   The witness is the husband of the first Claimant and father of  C,  the
    second Claimant. If the Claimant were to return to Nigeria even  for  a
    period of 60 days he would not be able to look after V  as  he  worked.
    And if he did not work he would have no income.  He would  be  able  to
    look after the other children but not  V.   In  cross-  examination  he
    agreed that he has seven children.  He was not good at changing nappies
    and had never bathed the children.  His income was  �7,000  per  annum.
    He did not claim any benefits.  He held a personal bank  account  which
    had not been produced in evidence.  He was employed for an agency as  a
    care worker looking after elderly and sick people.  He was on  a  "zero
    hours" contract. If he refused work,  the  agency  would  offer  it  to
    someone else.  It would not be possible  for  him  to  restructure  his
    hours as he was  dependent  on  work  that  was  offered  to  him.   He
    confirmed that after his mother-in-law died in Nigeria he  returned  to
    Nigeria to fetch three of his children. He  behaved  as  a  responsible
    parent seeking to look after his children.

8.   His wife was the primary carer for V and he would not be able  to  look
    after him.  He shared  parental  responsibility  of  the  children;  he
    helped them with their homework and he was  always  there  for  V.   In
    answer to a question from the Tribunal, what do you  do  with  V?   The
    witness stated that he played with him and took him out.  He  confirmed
    that V was now 1 year and 3 weeks old and he was eating mixed food  and
    no longer being breastfed.

Submissions

9.   Mr Whitwell  relied  on  the  two  reasons  for  refusal  letters.   He
    submitted  that  even  considering  Regulation  15A  from  a  practical
    perspective, the child would not compelled to leave the UK.  He  has  a
    British father who is employed and who would be able to vary his  hours
    notwithstanding the zero hours employment contract. No evidence of  the
    true  financial  position  for  the  father   was   adduced.   It   was
    inconceivable that he was able to support seven children on  an  income
    of �7,000 per annum.  The Secretary of State's  position  was  that  in
    practice it would be possible for the parents to make arrangements  for
    V such that he would not be compelled to leave the  UK.  In  the  event
    that he did so it would be a choice made by his parents.

10.  As regards Article 8 it was accepted that the Claimants were  not  able
    to meet the Immigration Rules.  There  was  no  compelling  reason  for
    looking outside of the Rules. There was family life in the UK, however,
    the three older children were overstayers. It could not be ignored that
    they may be returned to Nigeria.  The mother and  children  entered  on
    visit visas and sought to switch  category  whilst  in  the  UK.   They
    utilised public funds for education and NHS care.  Those factors needed
    to be properly evaluated.  It was in the child's best interests that  V
    remained with his mother but this was a choice.  The family  previously
    lived in Nigeria with the sponsor providing  financial  support.  There
    was no hardship nor was it disproportionate in the event that the first
    Claimant returned to Nigeria  for  a  short  period  whilst  making  an
    application for entry  clearance.   The  current  time  period  for  an
    application to be decided was 60 days.

11.  Mr Sharma relied on AQ (Nigeria) &  others  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  250  and
    submitted that in practice if the Claimant were returned to Nigeria the
    child would remain in the UK.  The alternative care  arrangements  were
    not feasible. The sponsor would have to leave his job and or would  not
    be able to earn as a result of his zero hours contract.  With  a  child
    aged 1 year and 3 weeks old, the  full-time  care  of  the  mother  was
    needed.  There were five children of varying ages and  with  an  annual
    income below �7,000, it was realistic that even with  additional  child
    care the father would not be able to care for the family.  If separated
    the mother would be apart from the children.

12.  EX.1 can apply to the child V because it is unreasonable for a  British
    citizen to relocate.  That must be put into the context of  concessions
    made by the Secretary of State.  Reliance was placed on Sanade & others
    (British children-Zambrano-Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00084 to the extent that
    it was not reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the  UK.   It  was
    submitted that where the primary carer is denied the Zambrano right  of
    residence, it was not arguable that the family could  relocate  outside
    of the European Union.

13.  The remaining issue under Article 8 was proportionality.  It could  not
    be proportionate that either the Claimant and V were separated  or  for
    the Claimant to be removed to Nigeria and separated  from  her  family.
    Ultimately there would be an enforced  separation  and  the  result  in
    practice would be that all of the children would return to Nigeria with
    their mother. The father would work and support them from the UK.

14.  Reliance was also placed on R (on  the  application  of  Chen)  v  SSHD
    (Appendix FM Chikwamba - temporary separation  -  proportionality)  IJR
    [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC).  It was acknowledged that the  Claimant  could
    not demonstrate that she met the Immigration Rules and therefore  there
    was no Chikwamba point.

15.  V was a qualifying child and this was the significant factor.

16.  In response Mr Whitwell emphasised the practical  approach  in  Sanade.
    A distinction is to be drawn between  the  British  citizen  having  to
    leave the UK whereas in this instance  the  Claimant  stated  that  she
    would take the child with her.

Discussion and Decision

Rule 15A

17.  In considering Regulation 15A the matter can  be  dealt  with  shortly.
    Although the emphasis for the resumed hearing  focused  on  the  second
    limb of Regulation 15A, the decision following the error of law hearing
    (and which was not challenged) found that no finding of fact  had  been
    made that the first claimant was the "primary carer"  for  the  British
    citizen child within the definition under Regulation 15. There were  no
    findings and no adequate reasons made in support of the decision  under
    Zambrano principles. The  First-tier  Tribunal  took  a  practical  and
    pragmatic approach in reaching a decision under the Zambrano principle.
     However in considering the same it omitted to evaluate the evidence so
    far as the sponsor is concerned. The  First-tier  Tribunal  omitted  to
    consider Regulation 15A(7)(b)(2).  The sponsor as a British citizen  is
    an exempt person and therefore the claimant cannot  be  regarded  as  a
    primary carer sharing responsibility for that person's  care  with  one
    other person.  I find the child, now aged 1 year, is cared for by  both
    parents who have joint parental responsibility for him.   I  find  that
    his mother the claimant cares for him on a day-to-day basis whilst  the
    sponsor is at work and provides financial support. The claimant as  the
    mother of a young child will  inevitably  take  the  primary  role  and
    responsibility for  his  care  in  practice.   I  did  not  accept  the
    sponsor's evidence that he was unable to look after the baby on a  day-
    to-day basis as he had no experience of changing nappies or bathing the
    child.  As the father of seven children this was  totally  implausible.
    In any event in evidence he confirmed and I find that he spends as much
    time as he can playing with the child and looking  after  him  when  he
    returns from work.





Caselaw

18.  In Hines v Lambeth [2014] EWCA Civ 660 Elias LJ considered the  meaning
    of "effectively compelled",

         "24. I do not however think that all things being equal the removal
             of a child from the care of one responsible parent to the care
             of another responsible parent would normally  be  expected  so
             seriously to impair his quality and standard of life  that  he
             would be effectively forced  to  leave  the  UK.   Apart  from
             anything else, he would, even if he did leave, still only have
             the care of one of his previously two joint carers."

19.  In Hines v Lambeth it was acknowledged that the welfare  of  the  child
    was not the paramount consideration and although  less  than  desirable
    the child might be able to be looked after by someone  other  than  the
    current primary carer (having regard to his age and other circumstances
    and dependency on another person).  It would only  be  if  no  adequate
    arrangements could be made that the child  would  effectively  have  to
    leave.  In Ahmed (Amos; Zambrano; Regulation 15A(3)(c) 2006  EEA  Regs)
    [2013] UKUT 89 (IAC) the Tribunal concluded that the test in all  cases
    is whether the adverse decision would require the child  to  leave  the
    territory of the  Union.   Essentially  it  is  whether  the  child  is
    dependent on the person being removed for the  exercise  of  his  Union
    right of residence and whether removal of that parent will deprive  the
    child of the effective exercise in the UK or  elsewhere  of  residence.
    In circumstances where as in this instance the child has a  father  who
    is a British citizen, it cannot be said that the mother's removal would
    effectively deprive the child of his right to reside and  enjoyment  of
    EU rights.  It cannot be said that the effect of  the  removal  of  the
    claimant would be that the child would have to leave the  territory  of
    the EU altogether.

20.  Although in Sanade and Others (British children -  Zambrano  -  Dereci)
    [2012] UKUT 0048  (IAC)  the  Tribunal  held  that  case  C-34/09  Ruiz
    Zambrano, Bailey: [2011] EUECJ C-34/09 now made clear,

         "... that where the child or  indeed  the  remaining  spouse  is  a
         British citizen and therefore a citizen of the European Union, as a
         matter of EU law it is not possible to require the family as a unit
         to relocate outside of the European Union or for the  Secretary  of
         State to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do so."

    However, that case and SSHD v AQ (Nigeria)  &  others  both  deal  with
    issues arsing in deportation proceedings.  The headnote [6]  in  Sanade
    is also relevant emphasising the  critical  question  was  whether  the
    child is dependent on the parent being removed for the exercise of  his
    Union right of residence. There has been  some  further  discussion  on
    this point in F and Another v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 76 emphasising  that
    where no EEA nationals acquire rights under Article  20  TFEU  only  if
    their expulsion from the territory of the EU would have  the  necessary
    consequence that a dependent EU child would be required  to  leave  the
    territory - effectively, the constructive expulsion  of  the  EU  child
    would Article 20 TFEU be engaged.  McCarthy  v  SSHD  (Case  C-434/09),
    judgment 5  May  2011  and  Dereci  held  that  nothing  short  of  the
    constructive expulsion of the EU citizen will suffice and  the  rupture
    of family life will not engage Article 20 TFEU.

    I find that the Claimant could not be regarded  as  the  primary  carer
    firstly because her husband is exempt as  a  British  citizen,  however
    even if she were the primary carer, as held  in  Hines  v  Lambeth  the
    transfer of a child from one responsible parent to  another  would  not
    seriously impair his quality and standard of  life  that  he  would  be
    forced to leave the UK. There are alternative arrangements  that  could
    be made for the care of V in the UK by his father choosing to alter his
    work arrangements or  giving  up  work  and  claiming  social  security
    benefits or paying for child care. V is now over one year and no longer
    breast fed.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that EU  law  is  not  engaged
    because V would not be compelled to leave.

Article 8

21.  I now consider if there are compelling  circumstances  outside  of  the
    Rules to justify any grant of discretionary leave under Article 8.  The
    Claimants entered  the  UK  as  visitors  and  thereafter  the  sponsor
    returned to Nigeria to bring his three other children into  the  UK  by
    way of visit visas following the death  of  their  grandmother.   I  am
    satisfied that there was no intention to return by the children nor the
    first  Claimant  to  Nigeria.  They  have  been  unable  to  meet   the
    requirements for entry clearance under the Immigration Rules.   It  was
    conceded by their representatives at the FTT that they were  unable  to
    meet the Rules for private and family life. I find that at present  the
    first Claimant would not meet the spousal rules on  financial  grounds.
    The sponsor's earnings are significantly lower than the required amount
    which would have an impact on  resources  and  public  funds  including
    education.  I take into  account  and  have  regard  to  the  statutory
    provisions under S117 2002 Act as amended  as  regard  public  interest
    factors. The rules deal with entry of partners  and  children.  I  find
    that V as a British citizen is a qualifying child.  In order to meet Ex
    1 and Ex 2, which as stated above is not free  standing,   it  must  be
    shown that it would be unreasonable to expect the child  to  return  to
    Nigeria or that there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing with that partner.  On the basis  of  the  evidence  and  my
    findings below, neither are established.

22.  The sponsor is a British citizen and father  of  five  children  within
    this family unit, only one child is a British citizen. There is  family
    life established in the UK,  although  at  the  time  the  sponsor  was
    granted ILR he established family life  with  another  partner  between
    2006 and 2009. Family life with the Claimant was resumed  in  2012  and
    their marriage took place  in  Nigeria  in  2013.  There  would  be  an
    interference with the family life in the event of the first and  second
    Claimants being returned to Nigeria.  They would be separated from  the
    sponsor and their reunification in the UK would  be  dependent  on  the
    first Claimant's successful application for entry clearance as a spouse
    or the second Claimant' s application as a child.  I am satisfied  that
    such interference would amount  to  sufficient  gravity  as  to  engage
    Article 8.  The question remaining is whether or not  the  interference
    is proportionate. On the information produced by the Secretary of State
    I find that the time frame for an entry clearance decision  in  Nigeria
    is 60 days.  I conclude that such a short period  of  separation  would
    not lead to any significant hardship for the children and  the  sponsor
    could be expected to take time off work for that  period.  The  sponsor
    stated in evidence that in the absence of the first  Claimant,  he  was
    able to look after all his children except for V.

23.  I have regard to the public  interest  factors  in  statutory  form  in
    Section 117 of the 2002 Act (as amended).   I  find  that  neither  the
    first and second Claimant nor the additional  four  dependent  children
    have any settled immigration status in the UK  other  than  V  and  his
    father. In terms of public interest weight is placed on the  fact  that
    the family have utilised resources in the UK both in terms of education
    and National Health care.  I did not find it credible that the  sponsor
    would be able to support his seven children  and  the  Claimant  on  an
    income of �7,000 per annum without further recourse  to  public  funds.
    As a British citizen however he is entitled to claim those funds.   The
    children have lived in the UK for a very limited period of time,  since
    2012 and prior to that they were living in Nigeria and  being  educated
    there.  All of the children have experience of living in Nigeria  where
    they have lived for the majority of their lives and  they  have  family
    members living there. V would not suffer any significant hardship given
    his young age. The sponsor lived  for  the  majority  of  his  life  in
    Nigeria and could choose to  return  to  resume  his  family  life  and
    private  life  and  take  up  employment  opportunities   in   Nigeria.
    Furthermore, it cannot be ignored that the sponsor  left  the  Claimant
    and four children in Nigeria in order to travel  to  the  UK  where  he
    lived for a number of years and where he  entered  into  a  significant
    relationship from which he had two children.  The evidence was that the
    parties reconciled in 2012 and married in Nigeria  in  2013.  In  those
    circumstances it is arguable that a return by  the  Claimant  with  her
    children would be a return to the status quo of the  family  life  that
    existed prior to 2012.  In  assessing  the  public  interest  with  the
    interests of the family,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  public  interest
    considerations  in  immigration  control  and  for  economic   reasons,
    outweigh the individual interests of the children  and  the  first  and
    second Claimants.

24.  In considering where the best interests of the  children  lie,  I  take
    into account that all the children under the age of 7 years. Their best
    interests would be for them to  remain  with  their  parents  together.
    Whilst  this  is  a  primary  consideration  it  is  not  the   primary
    consideration. I have weighed their interests as part of my  assessment
    of proportionality.  Further, more contrary to the submission  made  by
    Mr Sharma, EX 1  is  not  free  standing  but  is  parasitic  to  other
    requirements of the  rules  which  the  Claimants  cannot  meet  (Sabir
    (Appendix FM-Ex1 not free standing) [2014] UKUT 00063 (IAC)).

25.  I have also considered the sponsor's second family unit  consisting  of
    two British children D and Va from a previous relationship between 2005
    and 2007.  There was no  evidence  before  the  court  other  than  the
    sponsor's witness statement [10] in which he stated that relocating  to
    Nigeria would result in  his  being  unable  to  develop  any  form  of
    relationship with his children D and Va.  He refers to  the  fact  that
    his contact with the children takes place when he attends church  where
    he can see the children.  There is reference to resistance on the  part
    of the mother to him seeing the  children.   There  is  no  independent
    evidence to support the existence of any strong family life.  There was
    no evidence from or on behalf of these children  to  be  considered  in
    reaching a conclusion as to where their best interest lie.  I  find  on
    the limited evidence available, that in the event of  a  relocation  to
    Nigeria the relationship with the two  children  which  is  restricted,
    would be limited but not terminated. There is little evidence  to  show
    that there is any subsisting or regular meaningful contact  with  those
    children or of the impact on the children if the sponsor were  to  move
    elsewhere.  In  the  absence  of  any  independent  or  more   detailed
    information, I find that in light of the fact that the sponsor has  now
    re-established his relationship with his wife and  five  children,  the
    lack of evidence of any contact or formal access arrangements with  the
    children,  I  conclude  that  it  would  not  be  disproportionate   or
    unreasonable to expect him to maintain those  relationships  should  he
    wish to do so from Nigeria by way of Skype and visits to the UK.
