For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal  by  the  Appellant,  a  citizen  of  the  Democratic
    Republic of Congo, born on 25 December 1996 against the decision of the
    Respondent dated 27 November 2012  when  she  refused  the  Appellant's
    application for an entry clearance to settle in the United Kingdom, the
    relevant Immigration Rule being under paragraph 297 of the  Immigration
    Rules (as amended).

2.   The appeal was heard by First-tier Judge A W Khan at  Hatton  Cross  on
    29 October 2013 and in a determination promulgated on 18 November  2013
    he dismissed the Appellant's appeal.

3.   The Appellant's immigration appeal was dismissed solely  on  the  basis
    that the Judge concluded that the Appellant had failed to discharge the
    burden of  proof  upon  her  to  show  that  she  met  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules.  Indeed the Judge  was  clear  that  in  all
    other respects the requirements of the Immigration Rules were met.

4.   A  successful  application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted on the basis that the Judge was  simply  mistaken.
    He had miscalculated the figures before him.  It was contended that the
    Sponsor's income exceeded the weekly amount  necessary  to  demonstrate
    adequate maintenance.

5.   In granting permission to appeal First-tier Judge Brunnen had  this  to
    say:

         "The grounds on which permission to appeal is  sought  submit  that
         the Judge erred in law in that he made contradictory findings as to
         whether the maintenance requirement  in  paragraph  298(v)  of  the
         Immigration Rules  (not  297(e)  as  stated  in  the  grounds)  was
         satisfied.  In paragraph 12 of the Determination he found  that  it
         was satisfied and in paragraphs 15 to 21 he found that it was  not.
         The  grounds  further  submit  that  the  Judge's  calculations  in
         relation to the maintenance requirement were made on  an  erroneous
         basis as to the amount required and as to the amount available.


         In view of the long and detailed consideration of  the  maintenance
         requirement in  paragraphs  15  to  21,  what  the  Judge  said  at
         paragraph  12  cannot  arguably  have  been  anything  other   than
         inadvertence that did not  reflect  the  Judge's  actual  findings.
         However it is arguable that the basis on which the  Judge  assessed
         the maintenance requirements was erroneous."


6.   Judge Brunnen also granted permission in terms of a  contention  raised
    in the grounds that the Judge had erred  in  his  approach  as  to  the
    assessment of proportionality for the purposes of Article 8 of the ECHR
    but as the parties before me rightly agreed, such a consideration would
    necessarily fall away were I to find  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had
    indeed erred in law for the reason contended and that, in  consequence,
    the Appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

7.   Thus the appeal came before me on 7 February 2014 when  my  first  task
    was to determine whether or not the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Judge disclosed an error of law such as may have been material  to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

8.    At  the  outset  of  the  hearing,  I  was   provided   with   further
    documentation by Mr Sills who pointed out  that  as  contended  in  the
    grounds, the First-tier Judge had miscalculated the Sponsor's means and
    the amount that he needed to show, to demonstrate  that  the  Appellant
    met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

9.   I was referred to paragraph 20 of the determination, where  the  First-
    tier Judge stated that he had taken into account the sum of  �15,921.69
    per year as child tax credit.  Mr Sills pointed out  that  this  was  a
    mistake, because if one looked at the relevant document (that  appeared
    at page 35 of the bundle of documents before the First-tier  Judge)  it
    showed that the total annual figure was �16,884.90 and that the  figure
    shown below, namely �15,921.69 was  the  annual  amount  less  payments
    already received.  In fact, had the Judge  considered  the  calculation
    correctly he would have appreciated that the Sponsor  was  in  fact  in
    credit to the tune of �71.43 per week and as such the  Appellant  would
    have been found to clearly meet the  maintenance  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

10.   At  this  stage  in  Mr  Sills'  submissions,  Mr   Walker   helpfully
    interrupted in order to inform me that  he  accepted  for  the  reasons
    given in the grounds and further clarified by Mr Sills, that the  Judge
    was in error and that in fact he should have found that the maintenance
    requirements were met and thus allowed the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules.

11.  I was able to inform the parties that upon my own consideration of  the
    evidence I was in full agreement for like reason.

12.  I  further  confirmed  for  the  sake  of  completeness,  that  in  the
    circumstances, there was no need for me to consider issues relating  to
    Article 8 of the ECHR as this issue, in consequence, simply fell  away.



Decision

13.  The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

14.  I set aside the decision.

15.  I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.



Signed                                  Date 14 February 2014



Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein
