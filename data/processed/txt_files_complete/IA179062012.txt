Anonymity is granted in these proceedings in order to protect the interests
of DTN's minor children.

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Devittie) which in a decision promulgated on 4th  April
    2016 allowed the Respondent's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's
    decision of 2nd August 2012 refusing to revoke a deportation order made
    against him.

 2. For the sake of  clarity,  in  this  decision  I  shall  refer  to  the
    Secretary of State as  "the  Respondent"  and  to  D.  T.  N.  as  "the
    Appellant" reflecting their respective positions before the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 3. The Appellant is a citizen of Vietnam (born 4th  September  1976).   He
    entered the United Kingdom in August 2003 and claimed  asylum  a  month
    later.  That claim was refused and his appeal against that decision was
    dismissed in a determination promulgated on  9th  February  2004.   The
    Appellant remained in the UK unlawfully.

 4. On 26th June 2007 the Appellant pleaded guilty  to  producing  cannabis
    and was subsequently sentenced to eighteen  months'  imprisonment.   On
    18th March 2008, just before the completion of  his  prison  term,  the
    Respondent served a notice of intention to deport him.   The  Appellant
    made a belated attempt to appeal the Respondent's  decision  to  deport
    him in 2008, however the FtT refused to extend time for appealing.

 5. In August 2011 the Appellant entered into  a  relationship  with  V,  a
    British  citizen  and  the  couple  have   two   children   from   that
    relationship, D and A1 born in 2012 and 2013 respectively.  V also  has
    two children from a previous relationship, A2 and B both of  whom  live
    with her and the Appellant at the family home.

 6. On 2nd April 2012 the  Appellant  was  convicted  of  a  drink  driving
    offence.  On 2nd August 2012  the  Respondent  refused  to  revoke  the
    Appellant's deportation order.  He  appealed  that  decision,  but  his
    appeal was dismissed by a First-tier Tribunal panel  on  27th  November
    2012.  The decision was set aside by the Upper Tribunal and remitted to
    the First-tier Tribunal for the decision to be re-made.

 7. When the matter came once more before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that
    tribunal again dismissed the Appellant's appeal. The Appellant appealed
    that decision to the Upper Tribunal.  The decision was  once  more  set
    aside and remitted again to the First-tier Tribunal for the decision to
    be re-made.

 8. The matter then came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Devittie.   The
    judge in coming to his decision, relied upon oral evidence,  the  Crown
    Court judge's sentencing remarks in respect of the  index  offence  and
    evidence from an independent social worker contained in various reports
    which outlined the family's circumstances.  In a  decision  promulgated
    on 4th April 2016, he allowed the appeal, concluding as he did at [37];

         "I am satisfied taking into  account  all  relevant  circumstances,
         including the harm to the children, and the public interest factors
         supporting  the  Appellant's  deportation,  that  the   effect   of
         deportation on V and on the four children will be unduly harsh.   I
         accordingly allow the appeal."

Onward Appeal

 9. The Respondent sought  and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal.   The
    grounds seeking permission are extensive and may be distilled into  the
    following headings.

      1) Failure to Give Adequate Reasons for Findings on Material Matters

         The challenge raised in this ground is that  the  judge  failed  to
         provide adequate reasons  for  his  finding  that  the  Appellant's
         deportation would  result  in  an  unduly  harsh  outcome  for  the
         Appellant's children and step-children.  It  is  asserted  that  he
         made a bare statement as to the unduly harsh consequences  in  this
         case without providing adequate reasons to  support  his  findings.
         The judge failed to provide  reasons  that  weigh  the  Appellant's
         criminality against the inevitable upset that occurs when  families
         are split up.

      2) Making a Material Misdirection in Law

         The challenge raised in this ground is that  the  judge  failed  to
         identify the "very compelling" circumstances  in  this  case  which
         would cause the public interest in deportation  to  be  outweighed.
         It is said further that the judge failed  to  have  regard  to  the
         Tribunal decision in KMO (Section 117- Unduly Harsh) Nigeria [2015]
         00543 (IAC) and further, the judge failed to consider  the  factors
         outlined in Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

      3) Failure to take Account of and Resolve Conflicts of Fact or Opinion

         The challenge raised in this ground is that  the  judge  failed  to
         take  into  account  the  existence  of  the  Appellant's  spouse's
         extended family, including any support structure they could provide
         when determining the unduly harsh consequences of  the  Appellant's
         deportation.

    Permission having been granted, the matter came  before  me  to  decide
    whether the FtT's decision discloses an error of law requiring it to be
    set aside and re-made.

Error of Law Hearing

10. Before me Miss Isherwood appeared for the Respondent, Mr Syed  for  the
    Appellant.  Both representatives made  submissions.   Miss  Isherwood's
    submissions kept to the lines of the grounds seeking permission but she
    emphasised that essentially this appeal centred on a challenge  to  the
    judge's  lack  of  reasoning  contained  in  the  decision.   She  also
    emphasised that the judge in making his findings had focused heavily on
    the interests of the children and had  treated  those  interests  as  a
    paramount consideration, rather a  primary  consideration  only.   This
    approach had led to a failure to properly  weigh  in  the  balance  the
    public interest factors in favour of  deportation.   As  those  factors
    were not considered  appropriately  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise this amounted to a material error.

11. Mr Sayeed handed in a Rule 24 response and skeleton argument.  Although
    he went through that response in some detail  in  his  submissions,  he
    argued that essentially the Respondent's challenges amounted to no more
    than a series of disagreements with the fully reasoned decision made by
    the FtT Judge.  He said that the judge had directed  himself  properly,
    had taken into account unchallenged and uncontested evidence concerning
    the role the Appellant played in the lives of his  children  and  step-
    children and balanced that evidence against his reasoned findings, that
    the public interest does not require deportation in this case.

12. At the close of submissions I reserved my decision  which  I  now  give
    with reasons.

Consideration

13. The challenges raised by the Respondent are three-fold.  I am satisfied
    that Grounds (1) and (3) can be dealt  with  together.   The  challenge
    that they represent is essentially one namely the judge has  failed  to
    give adequate reasons for his findings.  It is said that the judge made
    a bare statement only as to the unduly harsh consequences resulting for
    the children of the family if he is deported and has  not  weighed  the
    criminality consequences, against the upset which occurs when  families
    are split up.  I find I disagree with the  Respondent's  assertions  on
    this challenge.

14. I find on a full reading of the  decision,  that  the  judge  spends  a
    considerable amount of time explaining his reasons for finding  why  as
    he does, that it would be unduly harsh on the Appellant's step-children
    if he  were  deported.   In  fact  he  starts  that  consideration  and
    reasoning at [27] and  reminds  himself  that  the  four  children  are
    British  children  and  more  importantly  reminds  himself  that   the
    interests of the children are a starting point only.

15. In assessing the best interests of the children, the judge was assisted
    by a report from an independent social worker.  The independent  social
    worker  attended  the  hearing  and  her  evidence  was,  and  remains,
    unchallenged  by  any  cross-examination.   The  judge   was   entitled
    therefore to place great weight upon the social worker report and  that
    evidence is summarised at [28(a)];

         "If (D. T. N.) was removed from the family ....... (V) would  be  a
         single mother with four children, two of them very young and two of
         them adolescents.  It is my opinion that (V) would suffer grief and
         depression and that this would diminish her capacity  to  care  for
         her children as well as her ability to work to provide them with  a
         good standard of living."

         "If (D. T. N.) is removed ... this will be a tragedy for the  whole
         family and in my opinion  will  cause  (A2)  significant  emotional
         harm."

         "The importance of (B) having a relationship with an adult male; he
         is beginning to have this now with (D. T. N.).  It  is  my  opinion
         that if (B) lost  this  relationship  with  (D.  T.  N.)  it  would
         compound his sense of loss and  cause  him  harm  by  damaging  his
         ability to trust adult males.  In my opinion, this  could  threaten
         his development into a mentally healthy adult male who can  achieve
         his social, educational and economic potential."

         "Further in respect of the impact upon (D),  she  reports  'in  the
         short-term it is my  opinion  that  (D's)  emotional  and  physical
         health would be compromised and that  in  the  long-term  he  might
         suffer from periods of depression that  could  continue  throughout
         his life.' "

16. The grounds criticise the judge for apparently failing to  have  regard
    and giving sufficient weight to the public interest  factors  prevalent
    in deportation.  I find this not so.  It is very clear that  the  judge
    has spent a great part  of  his  decision  in  considering  the  public
    interest factors weighing in favour  of  deportation.   He  takes  into
    account at [32] that  the  Appellant  stands  convicted  of  a  serious
    offence  and  he  states  that  he  recognises  the  need   to   attach
    considerable weight to  the  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of
    foreign criminals.  He also acknowledges that the Appellant  has  since
    the commission of the index offence, received a further conviction  for
    drink driving.  In addition the judge also acknowledges  the  statutory
    consideration in Section 117(c). At [35] he says the following;

         "One cannot as I have  indicated  understate  the  gravity  of  the
         offence of cultivating illegal drugs for commercial purposes but  I
         do take note that the sentencing  judge  recognised  as  mitigating
         factors that the Appellant was looking after  the  cannabis  plants
         not for his own profit but in exchange for �500 which he needed  to
         pay his debts.  As the statutory provisions make clear  in  Section
         117C of the 2014 Act, the deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in
         the public interest and the more serious the offence committed by a
         foreign criminal the greater is the public interest in  deportation
         of the criminal."

    It is hard to see what more the FtT Judge could have said to show  that
    he has factored into the equation  as  he  must,  the  public  interest
    considerations.

17. The final reasons challenge centres on a claim that the judge failed to
    take into account the existence of the  Appellant's  spouse's  extended
    family and any support structure they could give when  determining  the
    unduly harsh consequences  of  the  Appellant's  deportation.   I  find
    nothing turns on this challenge.  Whilst the FtT acknowledged that  the
    Appellant's spouse has various close family members nearby, there is no
    evidence that they are  able  or  indeed  willing  to  provide  support
    mechanisms for her should the Appellant be deported.  On the  contrary,
    the evidence from the Appellant's spouse was that  she  was  struggling
    with full-time work and was doing a mother and father's  job.  Although
    her family were mentioned there was no evidence of their willingness or
    ability to provide  meaningful  support.  This  is  borne  out  by  the
    independent social worker's report.

18. The final challenge to  the  decision  asserts  that  the  FtT  made  a
    material misdirection in law.  This commences with  a  claim  that  the
    judge misdirected himself by failing to identify the "very  compelling"
    circumstances in this case that would  cause  the  public  interest  in
    deportation to be outweighed.

19. As Mr Sayeed was quick to point out this  ground  is  misconceived.   I
    agree with his submission on this point reproduced  from  his  skeleton
    argument and set out here below;

         "Unfortunately paras 2(a) and (b) of the grounds in fact disclose a
         misdirection of law on the part of the SSHD herself.   She  asserts
         that the judge 'failed to identify 'very compelling'' circumstances
         in this case that would cause the public interest in deportation to
         be outweighed.

         The 'very compelling circumstances' threshold  only  applies  to  a
         potential deportee who has either been sentenced  to  a  period  of
         imprisonment  of  at  least  four  years,  or  alternatively  to  a
         potential deportee who was sentenced to less than four years but to
         whom paragraph 399 [unduly  harsh  vis  a  vis  minor  children  or
         spouse]  or  399A  [lawfully   resident/socially   and   culturally
         integrated/significant  obstacles  to  integration  in  country  of
         deportation] do not apply."

    I find that that succinctly deals with that challenge.

20. I turn now to what appears to be the remaining challenge, that the  FtT
    made a misdirection in failing to  consider  the  factors  outlined  in
    Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  Once again I find I accept  Mr  Sayeed's
    submission on this point.  The Respondent relies on  [  9]  of  the  UT
    decision in KMO (Section 117 - Unduly Harsh) Nigeria [2015] 00543 (IAC)
    for the proposition that Section 117B of the 2002 Act comes  into  play
    in deportation/revocation cases.

21. However I find force in Mr Syed's submission that the  weight  of  case
    law namely Bossade (sections  117A-D:  inter-relationship  with  Rules)
    [2015] UKUT 415 (IAC) and  Chege  (section  117D  Article  8  approach:
    Kenya)   [2015]   UKUT   165   (IAC)   specifically   focus   on    the
    interrelationship between part 5A of the 2002 Act and  the  Immigration
    Rules in deportation cases.

22. In Bossade, when this issue was examined it was held that ordinarily it
    will be appropriate for the Tribunal to first consider  an  Appellant's
    Article  8  claim  by  reference  to  the  Rules.   This  will   entail
    determining whether the relevant substantive conditions  are  satisfied
    by the person concerned.  Part 5A has no role in this discrete process.
     I accept Mr Sayeed's submissions therefore that the  correct  approach
    is that factors in part 5A have no role to play in the first  stage  of
    the two-stage assessment in complete code deportation matters.  I  find
    therefore that the FtT Judge conducted the assessment of  unduly  harsh
    consequences under paragraph 399 of the  Rules  lawfully  and  did  not
    misdirect himself in this regard.

23. For the foregoing reasons therefore I find that the decision of the FtT
    discloses no error of law requiring it to be set aside.   The  decision
    of the FtT stands.  The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.



Notice of Decision

The appeal of the Secretary of State is  dismissed.   The  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal allowing D. T. N.'s  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
State's refusal to revoke a  deportation  order  made  against  him  stands.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
