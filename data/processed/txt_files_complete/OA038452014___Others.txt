Solicitors LLP

Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Cote d'Ivoire, with dates  of  birth  as
    given in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. These are their linked  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Fox promulgated 1.7.15, allowing the appeal of a  fourth
    appellant at the First-tier Tribunal  but  dismissing  the  appeals  of
    these three appellants. All four appealed against the decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 8.2.13, to refuse him entry clearance to  the
    United Kingdom as ZZ.  The Judge heard the appeal on 22.6.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  McDade  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.10.15. However, when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb granted permission  to  appeal  on
    12.11.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 2.2.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Fox should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be summarised briefly as follows.

 7. The appellants had applied for entry clearance for  family  reunion  to
    settle with [MB], who  has  refugee  status  in  the  UK,  pursuant  to
    paragraph 352D of the Immigration Rules. This requires the applicant to
    have been part of the family unit of the person granted asylum  at  the
    time the person granted asylum left the country of  habitual  residence
    in order to seek asylum.

 8. The first appellant is the son of [MB]. At the date of  application  he
    was over the age of 18. By the date of the refusal decision in 2013  he
    was 20 years of age, and is now 23. The second and third appellants are
    grandchildren  of  the  [sponsor]  and  were  5  and   6   years   old,
    respectively, at the date of the refusal decision. As they are not  the
    children of [MB], they cannot qualify  under  paragraph  352D,  or  any
    other provision of the  Immigration  Rules.  As  an  adult,  the  first
    appellant cannot qualify under paragraph 352D.

 9. The fourth appellant is the daughter of [MB] and was 17 at the date  of
    the refusal decision. At  �28  the  judge  concluded  that  the  fourth
    appellant formed part  of  the  sponsor's  family  unit  prior  to  the
    sponsor's  departure  from  Cote  d'Ivoire,  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 352D, and thus allowed her appeal. She is now in the  UK  and
    was present with [MB] at the error of law hearing before me.

10. There may have been some confusion about the  family  circumstances  of
    [MB] and the other three appellants prior to her  departure  from  Cote
    d'Ivoire. She did not leave to seek asylum, but came to the UK in about
    2010 as a family visitor to tend to her  sick  daughter  [F],  and  was
    obliged to make her asylum claim when the  circumstances  in  her  home
    country changed with the commencement of the war in 2011. The Secretary
    of State granted her refugee status. At �44 the  judge  concluded  that
    all the appellants formed part of  [MB]'s  family  unit  prior  to  her
    departure from Cote d'Ivoire.

11. The evidence summarised by the judge suggests that [MB] left the second
    and third appellants in the care of her adult son [C],  the  father  of
    the second appellant. The second and third appellants  must  have  been
    about 2 and 3 years of age when the sponsor left them with [C], and can
    in consequence have little recollection of life with the sponsor. It is
    said that [C] has disappeared and his whereabouts are unknown.  At  �32
    the judge found that thereafter responsibility for the minor appellants
    was transferred to the first appellant, to whom [MB]  sends  money  for
    their maintenance and they have fixed accommodation.

12. From �21 it appears the judge understood the evidence to  be  that  the
    first appellant cannot care for the second  and  third  appellants,  as
    they live separately from him. This feature of separation  is  repeated
    at  �33  of  the  decision.  However,  before  me  Ms  Panadgiotopoulov
    submitted that this was  factually  inaccurate,  in  that  it  was  and
    remains the appellants' case that they all resided together in the same
    household with [MB] before she left for the  UK,  and  that  the  three
    remaining appellants continue to reside together. In any event, at  �35
    the judge  found  that  the  first  appellant  "continues  to  maintain
    meaningful contact with the other appellants," and at �36 that they are
    supported financially exclusively from the sponsor's resources  derived
    from the UK, and there is no  reliable  evidence  to  demonstrate  that
    arrangement  cannot  continue.  They  have  accommodation,   utilities,
    financial support, and the judge found there was no  reliable  evidence
    to demonstrate that their circumstances are materially  different  from
    other Cote d'Ivoire residents.

13. At �37, the judge considered that the article 8 claim is in  effect  an
    asylum claim, it having been asserted that the minor appellants live in
    desperate circumstances in transient accommodation (see  �27).  As  the
    judge pointed out, if their circumstances have materially changed since
    the date of application or decision, it is open to them to make a fresh
    application for entry clearance and to substantiate their  claims  with
    reliable evidence. At �47 the judge  found  the  evidence  demonstrated
    that the appellants have resided in Cote  d'Ivoire  for  a  significant
    period of time without adverse incident. The judge could  find  nothing
    more than socio-economic advantage to the application. At �41 the judge
    found no reliable evidence  to  demonstrate  why  the  children's  best
    interests would be served by leaving their current environment above or
    beyond the obvious socio-economic convenience.

14. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  assert  that  the
    judge failed to have regard to section 55 regarding the best  interests
    of the children and failed to  properly  assess  proportionality  under
    article  8  ECHR.  In  refusing  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  McDade
    considered  the  decision  to  be  carefully  reasoned.  However,   the
    assertion in the decision that section 55 was neither raised nor argued
    is disputed, it being pointed out that the  appellants'  representative
    relied on MK (s55 - Tribunal options) Sierra Leone [2015]  UKUT  00223,
    and �27 of the decision notes the section 55 arguments.

15. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Grubb  pointed  out  that  the
    success of the fourth appellant may be a post-decision fact and so  not
    relevant in an entry clearance case where  the  circumstances  must  be
    confined to those prevailing at the date of decision. "Nevertheless, on
    the basis of the matters raised in the grounds (para 4), it is arguable
    that  the  Judge  failed   properly   to   consider   the   appellants'
    circumstances in the DRC (sic), in particular in relation to the second
    and third appellants in assessing their 'best interests' and the impact
    upon the sponsor of separation. For these reasons, permission to appeal
    is granted."

16. However, it appears to me from �31 of the decision that the  judge  has
    carefully considered the impact of  the  second  and  third  appellants
    remaining in Cote d'Ivoire whilst the fourth appellant's  appeal  would
    be allowed, i.e. remaining in the  absence  of  the  fourth  appellant.
    Further, on the basis that it is  asserted  that  the  first  appellant
    lives with the second and third appellants, they have an adult  looking
    after them, supported by their grandmother in the UK.

17. The Rule 24 reply, dated 3.12.15, submits  that  the  grounds  have  no
    merit and merely disagree with the adverse outcome of the  appeal.  The
    judge considered all the evidence then available  to  him  and  reached
    conclusions open to him on that evidence.

18. From the decision it is clear that at �7 the appellants' representative
    conceded that the above-named appellants could not  succeed  under  the
    Rules and could only pursue article 8 ECHR. At �9 the judge set out the
    correct standard and burden of proof. Even though the  judge  suggested
    it was not raised in the appeal hearing, at  �13  the  judge  correctly
    directed himself on the section 55 duty to take  account  of  the  best
    interests of the minor appellants as a primary consideration. This  was
    again reviewed at �31 and particularly considered  in  respect  of  the
    second and third appellants.

19. It is clear that the three remaining  appellants  could  not  meet  the
    requirements for family reunion. The first because of his age, and  the
    other two because they are not the children of  the  sponsor.  Although
    the  judge  considered  that  the   circumstances   were   sufficiently
    compelling to justify consideration of  family  life  under  article  8
    ECHR, outside the Rules the Secretary  of  State  has  set  the  family
    relationship  perimeters  within  which  family  reunion   is   to   be
    facilitated and this is highly relevant to any article  8  family  life
    proportionality assessment. Whilst the judge accepted  that  there  had
    been family life between the sponsor  and  all  three  appellants,  the
    judge considered that the interference with that family life occasioned
    by the refusal to permit entry clearance, in the  legitimate  interests
    of maintaining immigration control to protect the  economic  well-being
    of the UK, was entirely proportionate on the facts of  this  case,  for
    the reasons set out between �47 and �53 of the  decision.  That  was  a
    conclusion open to the judge and for which  cogent  reasons  have  been
    provided. I am satisfied that the judge did take proper account of  the
    best interests of the child appellants as a primary consideration,  but
    as has been said, it is not a trump card over all other considerations.
    I am not satisfied that the  appellants  demonstrated  such  inevitable
    hardship as is asserted at �4 of the grounds arising from the impact of
    the departure of the fourth appellant  or  from  continuing  separation
    from the  sponsor.  There  was  in  reality  here  insufficient  cogent
    evidence to demonstrate that refusing entry  clearance  to  either  her
    adult son, or young grandchildren, was disproportionate.

20. In the circumstances, I find no material error of law in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal, even  if  the  section  55  best  interests
    assessment might have been more explicitly laid out in the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of  each  appellant  remains  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
