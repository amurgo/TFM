                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Stuart Walker and a  lay  member),  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 5 March 2014,  to   a  deportation  appeal  by  a  citizen  of
    Somalia, born 1 January 1988. On 29 July 2014 the Upper Tribunal (Judge
    Peter Moulden) found the panel's decision  wrong  in  law  and  set  it
    aside, apart from their findings of fact on the appellant's  individual
    case. However no further order was made, pending the publication of new
    country guidance,  now  to  be  found  in  MOJ  &  others   (Return  to
    Mogadishu) (CG) [2014] UKUT 442 (IAC).

 2. History: crime/detention     This  appellant  arrived  here  unlawfully
    with his aunt on 27 February 1998: his aunt claimed asylum on  arrival,
    on the basis that they were from the minority  Ashraf  clan.  This  was
    refused, but on 20 September 2000  they  were  both  given  exceptional
    leave to remain till 2004. Before that ran out, the  aunt  applied  for
    them to have indefinite leave to remain, which was given on 4  February
    2005.

 3. The appellant's criminal record  began  with  four  offences  of  minor
    vandalism and hooliganism in 2009, for which he  received  a  community
    order, and, following breach of that in 2010, curfew  and  unpaid  work
    orders. In  March  2011  he  received  eight  weeks'  imprisonment  for
    battery, with another consecutively for breach of bail. In  April  that
    year he received another community order for shoplifting, replaced with
    a week's imprisonment in May after he broke its terms. In August, again
    for vandalism he was sent to prison for two months.

 4. In September 2011 the appellant appeared before a Crown Court  for  the
    first time, for assaults, one sexual, at the end of April, and sent  to
    prison for six months,  with  seven  years  on  the  sexual  offenders'
    register. What must have been a minor piece of hooliganism in  February
    2012 received a nominal one-day sentence, while another shoplifting  in
    February got him 28 days on 5 March. The  appellant  must  have  served
    most of that sentence already, or been released very early,  as  on  28
    March he was already being sent to prison for 56 days  for  shoplifting
    and burglary. In May the appellant received  two  months'  imprisonment
    for assault and vandalism, and in  September  he  was  fined  for  more
    hooliganism.

 5. At this point the more serious part of the appellant's criminal  record
    starts: for attempted theft, committed in September 2012, he  was  sent
    to prison in February 2013 for 13 months. He had already been warned on
    three separate occasions in 2011 that further crimes  might  result  in
    deportation, and in March 2013 he received a letter telling him he  was
    liable to it. Since he made no reply, an  order  followed  on  7  June,
    which he appealed to the panel. Before  the  hearing  took  place,  the
    appellant was bailed on 10 October, and he remained at  large  till  30
    January  2015,  when  he  was  sentenced  to  a  total  of  52   weeks'
    imprisonment for burglary, including ten  weeks'  previously  suspended
    (it is not clear when, or what for) and now put into effect. Since then
    he has been either in prison or immigration detention.

 6. The facts of even the more serious of the appellant's offences  may  be
    of limited importance under the present legislation,  but  it  is  only
    right to note that, while it  is  accepted  that  the  latest  burglary
    involved an opportunistic attempt to break  into  an  off-licence,  the
    offence charged as attempted theft had been at least on the  borderline
    with robbery. As the  sentencing  judge  recorded,  the  appellant  had
    spotted a man of 75  drawing  money  from  a  cash-point  at  0100  and
    followed him, encircling him with his arms  so  that  he  fell  to  the
    ground. The victim  lost  �100,  though  this  was  not  found  on  the
    appellant when he was arrested.

 7. History: family/personal     The evidence as recorded by the  panel  is
    that the appellant's parents died before he left Somalia; so  his  aunt
    [S] had been looking after him for several years before she brought him
    here: she is still living in this country, with  her  husband  and  the
    appellant's grandmother. The appellant's sister [L]  arrived  in  2003,
    and now has six children, as well as a cousin living with her. She said
    the appellant had moved in with her after she arrived, and  lived  with
    her on and off for about two or three years. After that, and  until  he
    was first sent to prison in 2011, he had just come to eat with them and
    then left: if he had been drinking, then she wouldn't let him in.  From
    2009 - 11, he hadn't had a job; but, after  he  was  given  immigration
    bail in October 2013, he was working full-time  till  he  was  sent  to
    prison in 2015.

 8. Besides his Somali family, the appellant discovered by chance in  April
    2014 that he had become the father of twins, born in 2006 to a woman of
    Jamaican descent, with whom he had had a casual liaison. The biological
    relationship between them has been confirmed by DNA tests; but there is
    no further evidence of any contact, other than what the appellant  says
    himself, to which I shall turn in dealing with his oral evidence.

 9. History: health There is a report on the appellant's mental health by a
    consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Piyal Sen, dated 9 December  2015.
    From this it can be seen that  the  appellant's  drinking  had  led  to
    problems in the past, including being taken into hospital overnight; he
    was also a qat user. It was in 2010 that he had first started  'hearing
    voices', which went on till the next  event,  though  stilled  when  he
    drank. That event took place in August 2014,  when  the  appellant  was
    waiting for a bus on his way home from work, wearing an Arsenal  shirt.
    He was hit from behind with a bottle by a  person  unknown,  perhaps  a
    rival supporter, and woke up in hospital.

10. The records showed he had a subdural  h�matoma  and  a  fractured  jaw:
    there were further complaints about the voices, and a neurologist, whom
    he saw when he was detained at HMP the Verne in  June  2015,  diagnosed
    'organic  psychosis  secondary  to  head  injury'.  There  is  a   very
    comprehensive review of the records by Dr Sen, which there is  no  need
    to repeat here. The appellant had seen an occupational therapist ([EP])
    and a speech therapist. He  gave  a  history  of  being  visited  by  a
    transvestite djinn called Hilip, who "... took him from the  prison  to
    different worlds to meet characters like Christopher Columbus and Henry
    VIII and his wives." He also regarded the prison officers in charge  of
    him as djinns themselves.

11. The appellant is presently receiving Quetiapine, an anti-psychotic, and
    Sertraline (not explained by Dr Sen, but Wikipedia confirms  it  is  an
    anti-depressant), as well as another drug for a  specific  problem.  He
    had also consulted, and paid, someone he described as a 'witch doctor'.
    However, he says he has received the greatest relief from being soundly
    whipped by a priest, apparently a chaplain in the removal centre  where
    he  is  detained.  He  has  taken  overdoses,  apparently  of  his  own
    medication, in the past, but not since August 2015. There  had  been  a
    'complex case meeting' about him on 25 August, when a member  of  staff
    reported him as telling them "... about being impregnated by the  truck
    dog and ... asking [the welfare department] for  dog  biscuits  as  the
    baby was half Djinn and was called Theresa May".

12. The view had been expressed at the meeting that the appellant might  be
    "... acting out, as he had stated that he would demonstrate to the Home
    Office that he was unfit for detention and had threatened to go on food
    refusal and stop medication. He had put in a transfer application to go
    to another removal centre in the London area". As it  happens,  Dr  Sen
    had not been  instructed  by  the  experienced  specialized  solicitors
    acting for the appellant on this appeal, but by another  firm,  who  he
    had chosen to instruct on a separate challenge to the lawfulness of his
    detention. This needs to be borne  in  mind  in  considering  Dr  Sen's
    conclusions.

13. There were further reported comments about djinns and dogs. Dr Sen went
    on to review various reports by  others  since  that  meeting.  On  one
    occasion there had been a further trip with the djinn to  Columbus  and
    English royalty, this time Henry II. Dr Sen endorsed the view that  the
    appellant's head injury might have exacerbated his previous  delusions.
    His belief in djinns was 'culturally appropriate',  but  could  not  be
    explained by  that  factor  alone:  Dr  Sen  does  not  deal  with  the
    suggestion (see 11) that the appellant was making up the delusions from
    which he claimed to be suffering.

14. So far as any attempt to verify  the  appellant's  claimed  history  by
    personal observation is concerned, Dr Sen does not go further than "...
    some simple tests of retention and concentration  that  I  carried  out
    during my assessment, including the Serial 7's test, where he was  able
    to answer only two of the five questions". There is no attempt  in  the
    very lengthy report to explain what the  'Serial  7's  test',  is,  and
    nothing to show any steps  taken  to  verify  the  spontaneity  of  the
    appellant's answers to it.

15. Dr Sen also opines that

         "There is also evidence of impaired self-control  characterised  by
         impulsivity, lability of  mood  as  well  as  impaired  ability  to
         reflect  and  behavioural  rigidity,   which   are   characteristic
         behavioural features following traumatic brain injury."

    However he does not give any examples of this evidence, or  make  clear
    whether it comes from his own observations, or reports by others.

16. Dr Sen goes on to refer to the appellant's drug treatment, and  to  say
    that "Due  to  his  brain  injury,  his  tolerance  for  anti-psychotic
    medication would also be reduced, which has meant  that  he  cannot  be
    treated with adequate doses of Quetiapine". The doses given would  need
    to be closely watched; but while in  detention  the  appellant  is  not
    getting the specialist neuro-rehabilitation treatment he had previously
    been promised. He was said however to have partially responded  to  the
    medication he had been getting, but still to have "...  complex  neuro-
    rehabilitation   needs  with  regards  to   managing   his   day-to-day
    functioning with his  reduction  of  attention  and  concentration  and
    reduced memory, which are in significant part the effects of  his  head
    injury".  (Recreational) drugs and drink had  not  done  him  any  good
    either, and he might go back to them, if released without proper follow-
    up.

17. Dr Sen suggests that the appellant  has  long-term  problems  with  his
    mental  health,  in  terms  of  attention,   memory,   low   mood   and
    hallucinations. These were likely to last for longer  than  12  months,
    and quite possibly  for  the  rest  of  his  life.  Dr  Sen  recommends
    admission to a specialist brain injury service  for  assessment  and  a
    plan for him to be managed in  the  community.  He  suggests  that  the
    appellant should be placed in a suitable hostel; but if none  could  be
    found, then his sister should be approached to see if she  would  offer
    support, and if so to educate her in the warning signs  of  a  relapse,
    such as drinking too much.

18. Oral evidence   The appellant said he had no contact  with  his  Somali
    family, except for one teenage niece, who called him on the  quiet.  As
    for the Somali man called Yusuf who had given evidence for  him  before
    the panel, he had neither known him before  or  since,  though  he  was
    known to his sister. So far as his twins  are  concerned,  he  said  he
    spoke to them every month on the phone; but they were living with their
    maternal grandmother, and that  was  the  most  she  would  allow.  The
    appellant produced a copy of a typewritten letter,  dated  19  November
    2015, which he said he had sent them from detention. It is in very good
    English and expresses the intention of including �10, as well as  other
    good wishes. He said his Somali  family  had  been  unwilling  to  have
    anything to do with his children, when he had taken it up  through  his
    sister, though she herself had not been unsympathetic, and he had  been
    seeing them every week when he  was  at  large.  He  had  enlisted  the
    British Red Cross to help trace his extended family, but so far without
    success.

19. The appellant was cross-examined  about  what  [EP]  (the  occupational
    therapist) had said about him in her 'Discharge  Summary'  of  30  June
    2015. She noted that he hoped to be released, and, if so, would  return
    (from the Verne in Dorset) to "... K&C borough  at  his  sisters".  The
    appellant agreed that he  had  planned  to  return  to  Kensington  and
    Chelsea, where he had lived for 15 years, and  had  his  GP  and  other
    contacts; but to a hostel, and not to his sister's. When last at large,
    his appearances there had been limited to going round  to  collect  his
    post, which a nephew would bring out to him.

20. The appellant went on to say that his life was "... taken over by these
    miserable djinns", though he  said  he  hadn't  seen  his  transvestite
    familiar lately. He mentioned three suicide attempts in the  course  of
    the last year, and said  he  would  have  nowhere  to  go  in  Somalia.
    Otherwise he loved his motherland, and would be happy to return  there,
    if he had any family, or any life in the place.

21. Country guidance       The relevant part, assuming that  the  appellant
    knows nothing about his  origins  but  what  his  aunt  said  on  their
    arrival, can be seen at paragraph (xii)  of the judicial  head-note  to
    MOJ & others:

         ... it is not simply those who originate from  Mogadishu  that  may
         now generally return to live in the city without being subjected to
         an Article 15(c) risk or facing a real risk of destitution. On  the
         other hand, relocation in Mogadishu for a person of a minority clan
         with no former links to the city, no access to funds and  no  other
         form of clan, family or social support is unlikely to be  realistic
         as, in the absence of means to establish a home and  some  form  of
         ongoing financial support there will be a real risk  of  having  no
         alternative but to live in makeshift accommodation  within  an  IDP
         camp where there is  a  real  possibility  of  having  to  live  in
         conditions that will fall below acceptable humanitarian standards.

22. Conclusions: s. 117B & C     This is an appeal against  a  decision  to
    make a deportation order, taken as long ago as 7 June 2013; but it  has
    to be decided in accordance with ss. 117B and  C  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, introduced by the Immigration Act 2014
    . So far as s. 117B is concerned, all that needs to  be  said  is  that
    this appellant speaks good English, which is in his favour; but  he  is
    not financially independent, nor likely to be, at least  in  the  short
    term, which is not. The parts of s. 117C relevant for present  purposes
    follow.

         '117C Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)    C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)    C is socially and culturally integrated in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)    there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.'

23. This appellant is a foreign criminal, and one who has been convicted of
    serious offences, not only  the  mugging  of  a  much  older  man,  the
    sentence for which led to the decision to  deport  him,  but  also  the
    sexual assault, which, apart from six months' imprisonment, led to  his
    being put on the sexual offenders' register for seven years. There is a
    clear public interest in deporting him, subject to exceptions 1 and  2.
    On exception 1

         (a)  he has been lawfully resident here since 2000, which  is  more
             than half his life, and, since he was still a  child  at  that
             point, this requirement may be taken as satisfied;

         (b)  I do not regard him as 'socially and culturally integrated' in
             this country: even where his Somali family are concerned,  his
             sister's evidence before the panel (see 7) shows he had led  a
             fairly casual life with them, to the extent that he was  there
             at all. After that time, he had  received  no  less  than  six
             short sentences of imprisonment in the course  of  2011,  with
             longer ones in 2013 and 2015. He has worked  while  at  large,
             but it seems on a casual basis.

24. It follows from my conclusion on (b) that exception 1 cannot  apply  in
    this case, though it will still be necessary to consider  some  of  the
    questions posed by (c) in terms of articles 3 and 8 of the Human Rights
    Convention. On exception 2,  while  the  appellant  is  the  biological
    father of two nine-year old qualifying children, and I accept has  been
    in some kind of contact with them, I do not think even on his  evidence
    that  could  be  considered  a   'genuine   and   subsisting   parental
    relationship'; and there is certainly no evidence to suggest  that  the
    effect of his deportation  on  them  would  be  unduly  harsh,  whether
    compared to the public interest in removing him or not.

25. Article 3: country guidance  It follows from the appellant's failure to
    qualify under either exception to s. 117C (3) that the public  interest
    must require his deportation,  unless  there  is  a  Convention  reason
    against it.  Miss  Daykin  realistically  did  not  argue  any  Refugee
    Convention reason; but she did rely on article 3 of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention. For his part, Mr Norton accepted, following MOJ  &  others,
    that, if the  appellant  faced  no  alternative  but  life  in  an  IDP
    [internally displaced persons'] camp on return to Somalia, then article
    3 would prevent his return.

26. So far as the qualifying factors under MOJ are concerned, the appellant
    was not challenged on his origins, and I  am  prepared  to  accept  for
    present purposes that he is a minority clansman with no former links to
    Mogadishu. The issue before me was whether he had "no access  to  funds
    and no other form  of  clan,  family  or  social  support".  Mr  Norton
    suggested that he had invented the rupture with his  Somali  family  in
    response to what the first-tier panel had said (see their paragraph  32
    (6)) about useful links he would have on return. So far as any  further
    findings by me are concerned, on article 3 the appellant must show that
    any facts on which he relies are at least reasonably likely to be true,
    while on article 8, as under the law and Rules, he has to show they are
    more likely than not to be true.

27. The only evidence of continuing links is his own  expressed  intention,
    recorded in [EP]'s discharge summary  of  30  June  2015  (see  19)  of
    returning to his sister's if released. He denies that; but  it  is  not
    something that can be written off as careless  form-filling,  since  it
    does not appear in her previous joint report of 29 December 2014 [AB 12
    - 15]. I am not prepared to  accept  it  is  reasonably  likely  to  be
    mistaken, nor that the appellant does not have  continuing  links  with
    his sister. There may well have been a rift,  dictated  by  the  family
    elders she approached, over his siring of mixed-race children; but,  if
    the appellant were returned to Somalia, necessarily without them,  then
    there would be no reason for this to continue.

28. The appellant's sister has not of  course  given  evidence  before  me,
    though it follows from the finding I have just reached  that  he  could
    have called her if he wanted. She  has  an  established  life  in  this
    country, and was granted indefinite leave to  remain  on  21  September
    2000 [AB 201], after arriving on 21 March that year and claiming asylum
    [AB 202]. Those documents show she was born in 1980,  so,  unlike  this
    appellant, already grown-up when she came here. I am  not  prepared  to
    accept that she does not have either funds or contacts available to the
    appellant on return to Somalia.

29. It follows that the appellant cannot succeed on article 3, in terms  of
    paragraph (xii) of the guidance in  MOJ  &  others.  Miss  Daykin  also
    argued article 3 in terms of his medical condition; but that is  better
    dealt with when I have reached the necessary findings of fact  to  deal
    with this argument, both in that context, and on article 8.

30. Medical evidence       As already mentioned, Dr  Sen's  report  suffers
    from the disadvantage of having been prepared in aid of a challenge  to
    the appellant's detention in  this  country,  rather  than  his  appeal
    against deportation to Somalia. However, it is the  only  comprehensive
    review of this evidence. I am prepared to accept  Dr  Sen's  conclusion
    that the appellant suffers from problems with  attention,  memory,  low
    mood and hallucinations, as a result  of  the  injury  he  received  in
    August 2014.

31. I saw and heard  the  appellant  giving  evidence  for  some  time:  he
    appeared entirely lucid, though he complained from time to  time  of  a
    headache (for which unfortunately there were no suitable analgesics  in
    the building). I bear in mind that  the  detention  centre  staff  were
    clearly supervising his medication; but,  on  his  current  dose,  even
    without the monitoring recommended by Dr Sen,  he  is  clearly  stable,
    with some support. Given the potential support I have  found  would  be
    available for him in Somalia, I have no doubt that he would be able  to
    cope with daily life on return there, even in the short term,  so  long
    as supplies of Quetiapine and Sertraline were available.  Even  without
    monitoring, he is obviously intelligent enough to know he needs to take
    them regularly.

32. Article 3: health      It is quite clear from N v United Kingdom [2008]
    ECHR 453 that states parties to the Human  Rights  Convention  are  not
    obliged by the terms of article  3  to  export  their  own  health-care
    standards  world  wide.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Quetiapine  and
    Sertraline are available in Somalia; but so long as the  appellant  was
    sent back with  enough  to  tide  him  over  his  return,  any  adverse
    consequences of withdrawal would be a question of Somali resources, and
    not the responsibility of Her Majesty's Government. It follows that the
    appeal fails on article 3.

33. Article 8       The provisions of paragraphs 399 and 399A of the  Rules
    are now replicated in s. 117C, and, for the reasons already given, this
    appellant cannot satisfy them. It follows from paragraph 398 that  here



         "... the public interest in deportation will only be outweighed  by
         other factors where there are very  compelling  circumstances  over
         and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A."

34. There is nothing in this case arguably capable  of  amounting  to  such
    'very compelling circumstances', except for the appellant's health care
    needs. I am prepared to accept that he might go off the rails,  to  use
    the common expression, without Quetiapine and Sertraline. It is hard to
    rate that probability, given the basis on which Dr  Sen  was  asked  to
    report; but I will assume for present purposes that, without them,  the
    appellant is more likely than not to suffer some kind of relapse.

35. As for what form this would take, the appellant has recounted a  number
    of what on their face are florid delusions: see 10, 11 & 13. These have
    been accepted at face value by Dr Sen, without any  attempt  at  expert
    evaluation,  other  than  to  note  that  the  djinns  are  'culturally
    appropriate'. Whether this extends to transvestite  djinns  is  equally
    beyond common knowledge, and Dr Sen's expertise. However,  some  common
    sense has to be applied to the appellant's reported account as a whole,
    and I have to say that mine does not allow me to accept  as  a  genuine
    delusion the appearance of an avatar of the Secretary of State, in  the
    form of an imaginary offspring, out of the appellant  by  an  imaginary
    dog. In the light of this, I  am  not  prepared  to  accept  that  this
    appellant suffers from delusions as he claims.

36. Doing the best I can on the evidence available, while I am prepared  to
    accept that, without Quetiapine and Sertraline, this  appellant  might,
    at least in the short term, require some  family  or  clan  support  to
    maintain a reasonable existence in Somalia, that support is  likely  to
    be available. Even if it were not,  I  do  not  see  anything  in  this
    appellant's   prospects   capable   of   showing    'very    compelling
    circumstances' to outweigh the serious public interest in his  removal,
    and the appeal fails under article 8 too.
