Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Lemer, Counsel; Hoole & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For ease of  comprehension,  the  parties  are  referred  to  by  their
    appellate status and positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Respondent appeals with permission against the decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Suffield-Thompson allowing the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Respondent's decision refusing to  grant  him  asylum.  The
    judge also made obiter findings in relation to Article 8 ECHR  although
    without pronouncing a decision at the conclusion of the  determination.



 3. The Appellant appealed against that decision and was granted permission
    to appeal by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Campbell. The grounds
    upon which permission was granted may be summarised as follows:

      i) It is arguable that the judge erred by  failing  to  give  adequate
         reasons in relation to the risk on return where the  Appellant  has
         not been politically active in 18 years, and

     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred by  failing  to  give  adequate
         reasons in relation to the Article 8 matters.

 4. I was provided with a Skeleton Argument from Mr Lemer whilst Mr  Clarke
    provided copies of Chapter II of the  Assessment  of  Applications  for
    International Protection, Jakhu, R (on the application of) v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department (ETS: legitimate  expectations)  (IJR)
    [2015] UKUT 693 (IAC) and Secretary of State for the Home Department  v
    SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387, all  of  which  parties  had  the
    opportunity to consider before making their submissions.

    Preliminary Issue: Permission to appeal on a new ground out-of-time

 5. The Respondent had originally sought to appeal against the decision  of
    Judge Suffield-Thompson allowing the Appellant's  appeal  however  only
    did so on the basis of the grounds outlined above.

 6. Mr Clarke made an application for permission to appeal upon  a  further
    ground not canvassed thus far.  He  submitted  that  in  applying  rule
    276ADE(vi), the judge had applied the 'insurmountable  obstacles'  test
    instead of the  'very  significant  difficulties'  test.  Although  the
    appeal was not brought  in  time  it  was  a  Robinson  obvious  point.
    However, there was no reason given why the appeal was  not  raised  any
    sooner.

 7. In reply, Mr Lemer submitted that the point was  not  Robinson  obvious
    and was without merit given that the  complaint  concerning  the  wrong
    test being mentioned at �40 was a slip as the proper test was  in  fact
    applied earlier in the determination at �20  and  �26.  Mr  Lemer  also
    contended that very significant difficulties are mentioned in  relation
    to Appendix FM as well as 276ADE and that insurmountable obstacles  are
    comparable to very  significant  difficulties,  although  there  is  no
    authority on this point. Moreover, he submitted  there  was  no  reason
    given for the delay and permission should not be given out of time.

 8. I indicated to the parties that I refused the application with  reasons
    to follow. Those reasons are as follows. The Respondent  and  Appellant
    are both bound by the terms  and  strictures  of  The  Tribunal  (Upper
    Tribunal) Procedure Rules 2008  and  its  time  limits  stipulated  for
    bringing an appeal. There is a wealth of  authority  that  makes  clear
    that reasons must be given for every moment of delay that  passes  (see
    BO and Others (Extension of time for appealing)  Nigeria  [2006]  UKAIT
    00035  and  Samir  (FtT  Permission  to  appeal:  time)   [2013]   UKUT
    00003(IAC). There are no reasons given here. Furthermore, the ground is
    itself without merit. It is trite that the doctrine of Robinson obvious
    issues are not normally to be employed in favour of the  state  failing
    to take an issue in an appeal (see Miftari v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 481), however  there  is  also  nothing
    Robinson obvious in my view that would assist the Respondent. I  accept
    Mr  Lemer's  submission  that  the  consideration  of  Article  8   was
    substantively performed with the correct test  in  mind  and  that  the
    referral to 'insurmountable obstacles' is  anomalous.  Consequently,  I
    refused to extend time to allow  the  Respondent  to  advance  her  new
    ground.

 9. Mr Clarke indicated that he would only pursue Ground 1  given  that  he
    had not succeeded in gaining permission to pursue  the  new  Article  8
    ground, which effectively meant that the alternate  obiter  basis  upon
    which the judge would have allowed the appeal stood firm.

    Error of Law

10. At the close of submissions,  I  indicated  that  I  would  reserve  my
    decision, which I shall now give. I find that there was an error of law
    in the decision such that it should be set aside.  My  reasons  for  so
    finding are as follows.

    Discussion

11. Mr Clarke stated that the source material referred to by the  judge  at
    �40 was the Civil Rights Defenders article of 17 May 2014. He submitted
    that this evidence was not weighed against the Respondent's Response to
    the COI request of 16 September 2014 at �19 of the determination, which
    stated that failed asylum seekers were not at risk. The  Appellant  had
    an 18-year old claim and his position was not addressed  by  the  Civil
    Rights Defenders article nor the lack of sur place activity. The  judge
    does not engage with the article itself other  than  the  human  rights
    situation being at an "all time low". The COI  Request  from  the  Home
    Office contradicted the article and was not considered. Mr Clarke  also
    referred to Article 4, paragraph 3(a) of Chapter II which confirms that
    the member state's assessment of  international  protection  should  be
    carried out taking into account all relevant facts. However, the  judge
    has failed to deal with anti-government activity and the Appellant  has
    nothing to do with post-2010 activity. Whilst the Appellant was at  one
    time an activist, there's nothing to show he has anything  to  do  with
    the activities post-2010.

12. Mr Lemer submitted that the Appellant's claim was not so  simple  claim
    as that of a mere failed asylum seeker and there was more  to  it  than
    that. The judge was not  obliged  to  cite  all  evidence  relied  upon
    however the COI Request was  refered  to  at  �19  and  was  implicitly
    considered. Mr Lemer was at pains to highlight  that  the  COI  Request
    posited the Appellant's position as that of a mere failed asylum seeker
    which was not correct. The Appellant's case is set out  comprehensively
    at  �17  of  the  determination,  and  is  quite  different  from   the
    Respondent's adopted position. The  Appellant  has  a  claim  that  has
    failed but it still needed to be taken into account and  therefore  the
    request posed was wrong in failing to do so. Notwithstanding that,  the
    reply merely referred to passages from a US  State  Department  Country
    Report but no information  was  provided  which  could  assist  in  the
    assessment of the Appellant specifically. Mr Lemer submitted  that  the
    judge addressed the position of  failed  asylum  seekers  returning  to
    Belarus at ��34-38, and in particular at �38.  He  contended  that  the
    report complained of dealt with the elections in 2010  but  also  dealt
    with events post 2010;  for  example,  it  refers  to  new  legislation
    introduced in 2012 for more governmental scrutiny  and  also  concerned
    the "the  right  to  political  rights".  Mr  Lemer  highlighted  other
    material also before the  judge  including  the  Belarus  Digest  which
    states that the regime encouraged persons to leave Belarus and material
    from UNCAT talked about frequent  detention  and  conditions  faced  in
    detention. Concerning Chapter  II,  he  submitted  that  there  was  an
    obligation on the member state to assist in  the  fact-finding  process
    however there is no COI Report on Belarus whatsoever, which  Mr  Clarke
    accepted. Given that the judge accepted the  Appellant's  account,  the
    appeal decision should be maintained.

    Conclusion

13. In my view, the Respondent's appeal is misguided. It is true  that  the
    Appellant's claim is historic, however, the  Tribunal  can  only  reach
    conclusions and make its decision based upon the material that  parties
    choose to put before it. The Respondent's COI Request was clearly noted
    and referred to by the judge and was in my view considered.  The  Civil
    Rights Defenders article was also similarly noted and  referred  to  by
    the judge. That the latter impressed the judge more than the former  is
    a decision that the judge was entitled to  take.  The  judge  does  not
    refer to the other materials put before him by the  Appellant  such  as
    the Belarus Digest and the UNCAT, however, it is  not  complained  that
    those items were not considered, and it is implicit that they were  and
    that the judge reached his conclusion based upon an assessment  of  the
    objective evidence overall.

14. The Appellant's historic claim was known to the judge and all that  the
    First-tier Tribunal could do would be to  assess  that  factual  matrix
    against the objective evidence available.  The  fact  of  the  historic
    nature of the claim or the lack of sur place  activity  do  not  in  of
    themselves detract from the Appellant's claim without more.  There  was
    no positive evidence put forward by the Respondent  that  the  risk  on
    return would deteriorate over time and consequently, such a  submission
    is circular. If the Respondent's COI Request states that failed  asylum
    seekers are not at risk, that may be one  thing,  however  the  judge's
    findings do not reveal that the Appellant's political profile is to  be
    viewed  so  simplistically.  Furthermore,  it  speaks  volumes  of  the
    Belarussian state that so little is known about it that the  Respondent
    has been unable to compile any form of COI Report at all.

15. Therefore, in light of the above, the judge's assessment of the limited
    documentary evidence put before them was correct and lawful.

16. Consequently, given my findings above, the grounds  do  not  reveal  an
    error of law such that the decision should be set aside.

    Decision

17. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is affirmed.

    Direction Regarding Anonymity -  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008

19. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly  or
    indirectly identify him or any member of  his  family.  This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent. Failure to  comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
