Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Khan, Counsel instructed by Sadozai Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent in these proceedings was the appellant before the First-
    tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the parties as they  were
    in the First-tier  Tribunal  so  that  for  example  reference  to  the
    respondent is a reference to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.


 2. The appellants are Indian nationals. The first and fourth-named
    appellants are husband and wife.


 3. On May 19, 2009 the first-named appellant entered the United Kingdom as
    a working holidaymaker.

 4. On August 1, 2009 the fourth-named appellant entered the United Kingdom
    as a working holidaymaker with the second-named appellant as her
    dependent.

 5. The first, second and fourth-named appellants returned to India on May
    4, 2011 and they subsequently re-entered the United Kingdom as student
    and dependents on July 11, 2011. Their leave to remain was subsequently
    extended until December 6, 2014.

 6. The third-named appellant was born in the United Kingdom on October 25,
    2012 and on August 20, 2013 he was granted leave in line with the other
    appellants.

 7. On September 2, 2014 they submitted applications on family and private
    life grounds but this was refused with a right of appeal.

 8. On August 31, 2016 the appellants applied for leave to remain on human
    rights grounds. The respondent refused their applications on October 4,
    2017 under both Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and paragraph
    276ADE HC 395.

 9. The respondent refused the first-named appellant's application under
    Section S-LTR 1.6 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules because he
    was satisfied that the first-named appellant had fraudulently taken a
    TOEIC test on April 17, 2012. With regard to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) HC
    395 the respondent submitted there were no "very significant obstacles
    to his integration" into India.

10. The respondent refused the fourth-named appellant's application on the
    basis that she did not satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM of the
    Immigration Rules because the first-named appellant was not a
    qualifying person and there were no "very significant obstacles to her
    integration" into India under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) HC 395.

11. The respondent refused the second and third-named appellants'
    applications under the Immigration Rules because their parents did not
    meet the requirements of Appendix FM and as the second-named appellant
    had not been in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven
    years he submitted it was not unreasonable to expect either child to
    return to India with their parents.

12. The respondent considered their appeals under article 8 ECHR and had
    regard to section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act
    2009 but concluded that it was both reasonable and section 55 compliant
    for the second and third-named appellants to accompany their parents
    back to India in light of the fact the first-named appellant had
    fraudulently obtained a TOEIC certificate. The public interest
    outweighed their wishes to remain in the United Kingdom.

13. The appellants appealed these decisions on October 16, 2017 and their
    appeals came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Place on April 24,
    2018. In a decision promulgated on May 4, 2018 the Judge found that the
    first-named appellant was a credible witness and had taken the TOEIC
    test himself.

14. The Judge placed weight on the fact that the second-named appellant had
    almost accrued seven years continuous residence in the United Kingdom
    and that for all practical purposes the United Kingdom was her home as
    she had family and friends here and had been educated here. The Judge
    accepted evidence that she could neither speak nor write Hindi or
    Gujarati. The Judge therefore took a pragmatic view that whilst the
    second-named appellant was not a qualifying child under Section 117B(6)
    of the 2002 Act she should be treated as a qualifying child and the
    Judge allowed all appeals on the grounds it would be unreasonable to
    require the second-named appellant and her sibling to leave the United
    Kingdom.

15. The respondent lodged an application for permission to appeal on May
    10, 2018 challenging both the Judge's approach to the TOEIC test, the
    Judge's approach to section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act and the
    proportionality assessment.

16. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    O'Keeffe on August 8, 2018. In finding an arguable error in law the
    permission stated that the Judge made no reference to any law when
    considering the issue of deception and made no clear finding on whether
    the respondent had discharged the initial burden that there was a
    deception and that this assessment affected the overall assessment of
    proportionality.

17. No anonymity direction is made.

    SUBMISSIONS

18. Mr Whitwell adopted the grounds of appeal and submitted that the  Judge
    had made errors in law in both her approach to the issue of whether the
    respondent had satisfied the burdens placed on her by the  Tribunal  in
    the cases of SM and Qadir v SSHD (ETS-Evidence-Burden of Proof)  [2016]
    UKUT 000229 (IAC) and SM and Qadir and SSHD [2016] EWCA  Civ  1167.  He
    submitted that the Judge had  not  considered  the  case  law  and  had
    wrongly stated that there was only generic evidence before her when  in
    fact there was the actual test result and an article  on  the  specific
    education provider. The Judge failed to  take  into  account  that  the
    court had recognised that people used a proxy taker for  a  variety  of
    reasons and the fact the first-named  appellant  had  given  a  correct
    immigration history and had had leave did not mean he was  telling  the
    truth. Additionally, when considering article 8 the Judge wrongly  took
    a "pragmatic" view when considering section 117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act
    because it was accepted  at  the  hearing  that  neither  child  was  a
    qualifying child. This error and the fact the Judge  wrongly  concluded
    that no proxy taker had been used undermined the article 8 assessment.

19. Mr Khan opposed the application and submitted that whilst  there  could
    be criticisms raised regarding the Judge's approach in paragraph 17  of
    her decision nevertheless he submitted that the Judge had followed  the
    approach recommended in SM and  Qadir.  The  Judge  had  concluded  the
    respondent had not proved his case and the finding was  therefore  open
    to her. With regard to article 8 the Judge had given  detailed  reasons
    why the appeal had been allowed and whilst he  accepted  neither  child
    satisfied the "seven year rule" at the date of hearing  the  Judge  was
    entitled to take into account that  the  eldest  child  had  spent  the
    majority of her life in the United Kingdom and had been in this country
    for almost seven years at the date of hearing.

    FINDINGS

20. Having considered the submissions put forward I  concluded  that  there
    had been an error in law in this case.

21. The Judge failed to identify any case law in her decision and  that  is
    of particular importance when that case law provided  a  structure  for
    cases  involving  allegations  of   fraudulently   obtained   education
    certificates.

22. At paragraph 17 the Judge wrongly stated  that  she  only  had  generic
    information before her. In addition to the standard witness  statements
    the Judge also had been provided with a Project Faï¿½ade  report  on  the
    appropriate educational establishment and that report demonstrated that
    between March 20, 2012 and February 5, 2014 Premier  Language  Training
    Centre undertook 5055 tests of which 75% were found to be invalid.  The
    Judge attached no weight to this document and also attached  no  weight
    to the "Look up Tool" which  identified  the  appellant's  test  is  an
    invalid test.

23. The Tribunal and Court  of  Appeal  made  it  clear  that  the  generic
    evidence (witness statements) was sufficient  to  satisfy  the  initial
    burden of proof placed on the respondent and the  appellant  thereafter
    had to present an explanation  and  the  Judge  was  then  required  to
    consider whether  that  explanation  was  outweighed  by  the  evidence
    produced  by  the  respondent.  The  Judge  erred  by  finding  a  good
    immigration history meant he had not "cheated" because  she  failed  to
    consider other material evidence that  was  before  her.  This  finding
    subsequently infected the article 8 assessment.

24. The article 8 assessment was also  flawed  because  the  Judge  wrongly
    accepted that the second-named appellant was a  qualifying  child.  The
    Judge was entitled to give weight to the fact the  child  had  been  in
    this country for a considerable period of time but the Judge  erred  by
    accepting she was a qualifying child.

25.  I  therefore  find  that  there  had  been  errors  in  law  and  both
    representatives agreed that this matter would have to be remitted  back
    to the First-tier Tribunal.

26. Section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007  sets
    out the procedure where a case is to be remitted back to the First-tier
    Tribunal.  I am satisfied that as there  was  a  procedural  unfairness
    that this is a case that will have to be remitted back  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to be heard by a Judge other than Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Place.

Notice of Decision

27. There is an error of law.  I set aside  the  original  decision  and  I
    remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 12(1) of
    the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.
