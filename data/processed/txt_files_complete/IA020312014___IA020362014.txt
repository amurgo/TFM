Representation:

For the claimants:     Mr Z Awan, instructed by Mayfair Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Gurjeet Kaur, date of  birth  4.8.89,  and  her  husband
    Surjinder Singh, date of birth 20.8.87, are both citizens of India.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet, who allowed the claimants'  appeals
    against the decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  20.12.13,  to
    refuse their applications made on 16.4.13 for leave to remain in the UK
    as Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and dependant spouse, and to remove
    them from the  UK  by  way  of  directions  under  section  47  of  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 13.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Landes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.8.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Sweet should be set aside.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Landes found it  arguable  that
    Judge Sweet erred in law in the consideration of paragraph 245AA of the
    Immigration Rules and the application of  a  flexibility  policy.  "The
    basis on which the judge allowed the appeal  was  that  the  respondent
    should have sought further documents from the  first  appellant  before
    making a decision (see paragraph 23 determination).  It  is  not  clear
    therefore why he allowed the appeal outright rather than remitting  the
    decision to the respondent. I observe that the judge indicated that  if
    he was wrong in his conclusions, he would have allowed  the  appeal  on
    human rights grounds on the basis of CDS (Brazil). The grounds  do  not
    specifically deal with this point but it seems arguable that the  judge
    erred in law in this respect in that  he  did  not  direct  himself  in
    accordance with Patel [2013] UKSC 72 (in particular paragraph 57)."

 7. The application of the first claimant  failed  because  she  failed  to
    qualify for the necessary 10 points under  Appendix  C  in  respect  of
    maintenance funds. On the calculation of the Secretary  of  State,  the
    claimant needed to demonstrate a total of  �4,400  over  a  consecutive
    period of 28 days between 5.2.13 and  4.3.13.  However,  the  submitted
    bank  statement  showed  a  maximum  balance  during  that  period   of
    �4,201.04. The claimant therefore did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration Rules.  The  appeal  of  the  second
    claimant dependant husband stands or falls with that of his wife.

 8. Judge Canavan carefully set out the evidence and submissions and at �17
    of the determination noted that the claimant submitted 6 pages of  bank
    statements and "there was therefore no  indication  to  the  respondent
    that  there  were  any  missing  documents,  namely  consecutive   bank
    statements, on  which  they  should  have  sought  further  information
    pursuant to paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration  Rules."  The  judge
    concluded within �17 of the determination that the Secretary  of  State
    was entitled to take the decision she did.

 9. However, from �18 of the determination Judge Canavan went astray in the
    application  of  paragraph  245AA  and  application  of  an  evidential
    flexibility policy.

10. In SSHD v Rodriguez and Others [2014] EWCA Civ 2,  where  it  was  held
    that the Secretary of State was not  under  any  obligation  to  afford
    applicants for leave to remain as Tier 4 (General) Student Migrants any
    opportunity to remedy defects in their application under an  evidential
    flexibility policy. The Court  of  Appeal  noted  that  the  evidential
    flexibility policy was not designed to  give  an  applicant  a  general
    opportunity first to remedy any defect or inadequacy in an  application
    or supporting documentation so as to save the application from  refusal
    after consideration.

11. The  common  law  principle  of  fairness  does  not  impose  any  such
    obligation and nor do the specific provisions of paragraph 245AA of the
    Immigration Rules, which came into force in relation to  PBS  cases  in
    September 2012. In effect, in  relation  to  PBS  cases  no  evidential
    flexibility policy survived the introduction of  paragraph  245AA.  The
    provisions of 245AA are set out below:

         "245AA. Documents not submitted with applications

         (a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in  Part  6A  state
         that specified documents must  be  provided,  the  Entry  Clearance
         Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of  State  will  only
         consider documents that have been submitted with  the  application,
         and will only consider documents submitted  after  the  application
         where they are submitted in accordance with subparagraph (b).

         (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

         (i) Some of the documents in a  sequence  have  been  omitted  (for
         example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);

         (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is
         not on letterhead paper as specified); or

         (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or

         (iv) A document does not contain all of the specified information;

         the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or  the  Secretary
         of State  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his  representative  in
         writing, and request the correct documents. The requested documents
         must be received at the address specified in the request  within  7
         working days of the date of the request.

         (c) Documents will not be requested where a specified document  has
         not been submitted (for example an English language certificate  is
         missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer
         or the Secretary of State does not anticipate that  addressing  the
         omission or error referred to in subparagraph (b) will  lead  to  a
         grant because the application will be refused for other reasons.

         (d) If the applicant has submitted a specified document: (i) in the
         wrong format; or

         (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or

         (iii) which does not contain all of the specified information,  but
         the missing information is verifiable from:

         (1) other documents submitted with the application,

         (2) the website of the organisation which issued the  document,  or
         (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body;

         the application may be granted exceptionally, providing  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State is
         satisfied  that  the  specified  documents  are  genuine  and   the
         applicant meets all the other  requirements.  The  Entry  Clearance
         Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State reserves the
         right to request the specified original documents  in  the  correct
         format in all cases where (b) applies, and to  refuse  applications
         if these documents are not provided as set out in (b)."

12. The judge took the view that the Secretary of  State  could  have  seen
    that the bank statements were not sufficiently up-to-date, "and  if  it
    had sought the outstanding documents they would have seen that for  the
    relevant period the appellant did indeed have the necessary �4,400 over
    a 28 day period (as now shown on pages 16  to  18  of  the  appellant's
    bundle)."

13. That conclusion amounted to an error of law. It was for the claimant to
    submit  the  documents  relied  on  as  evidence  that  she   met   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules. As the judge noted at �17, there
    was nothing within the submitted bank  statements  to  suggest  to  the
    Secretary of State that there was a missing page or other document,  on
    which further  information  should  have  been  sought.  All  the  bank
    statements were  consecutive  and  numbered  6  pages.  The  conclusion
    reached at �18 and �19 is entirely inconsistent with the finding at �17
    and with the provisions of paragraph 245AA. There  was  nothing  within
    the submitted bank statements, which went up to 4.3.13, to suggest that
    later bank statements would have shown the �4,400 the  claimant  needed
    to evidence. The Secretary of State is not required to speculate as  to
    whether there may be other documents or funds sufficient  to  meet  the
    application.

14. Further, in taking into account the later bank statements submitted  by
    the claimants for the purpose of the appeal, Judge Canavan fell foul of
    section 85A(4) of the Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,
    which prohibits the Tribunal from considering evidence in  a  PBS  case
    that was not submitted in support of and at  the  time  of  making  the
    application to which the immigration decision relates.

15. If the judge concluded that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  failed  to
    properly seek further information from the claimant, the correct course
    would have been to allow the appeal  to  the  limited  extend  that  it
    remained for the Secretary of State to make a  decision  in  accordance
    with the Rules.

16. In the  circumstances  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
    immigration grounds cannot stand and must be set aside and remade.

17. Judge Canavan was also in error in the alternative conclusion at �20 of
    the determination that  the  appeal  would   have  been  allowed  under
    article 8 on the basis of private life, pursuant to CDS (Brazil) [2010]
    00305 (IAC). That authority is somewhat dated and the judge  failed  to
    consider Patel [2013] UKSC 72, at paragraph 57  where  the  court  held
    that article 8 is not a general dispensing power. "The opportunity  for
    a promising student to complete his course  in  this  country,  however
    desirable in general terms, is not in itself a  right  protected  under
    article 8."

18. More recently, in Nasim and others (article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC),
    the Upper Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical removal  of  the
    22 PBS claimants, pursuant to the decision to  refuse  to  vary  leave,
    would violate the UK's obligations under article 8  ECHR.  Whilst  each
    case must be determined on its merits,  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity."

19. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."

20. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:
         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."

21. In none of the cases under consideration in Nasim  did  the  claimant's
    private life rights render their  removal  and  interruption  to  their
    studies  disproportionate.  As  the  court  held,  "unless  there   are
    particular  reasons  to  reduce  the  public  interest   of   enforcing
    immigration  controls,  that  interest  will  consequently  prevail  in
    striking the proportionality  balance  (even  assuming  that  stage  is
    reached)."

22. Mr Awan submitted that at the First-tier Tribunal he argued  the  issue
    of fairness and submitted to me that as this was an in-country  appeal,
    the judge was entitled when considering article 8 to look  at  all  the
    evidence up-to-date and take account of the fact that the claimant  had
    the money and could have demonstrated that to the Secretary of State if
    the correct documents had been submitted.  I  see  no  reference  to  a
    fairness issue in the determination. Whilst the outcome may seem  harsh
    to the claimants, I do not accept Mr Awan's argument that the  decision
    was unfair. There  is  nothing  in  the  decision  or  actions  of  the
    Secretary of State that is unfair and it is not  unfair  to  apply  the
    Rules, which include a degree of latitude  under  paragraph  245AA  but
    only in certain types of situation, none of which  meet  the  facts  of
    this case.

23. In the circumstances the judge's conclusion at �20 of the determination
    was in error, if indeed it is part of the decision, as it was expressed
    in the alternative. There was and is  no  proper  basis  to  allow  the
    appeal under article 8  on  the  single  stated  reason  that  she  had
    completed over one year of her studies.

24. Both Mr Awan and Mr Avery agreed with me that there was no  purpose  in
    hearing further evidence on the matter before  remaking  the  decision,
    which I did by dismissing the appeal on all grounds.

Conclusions:

25. For the reasons set out herein, the making of the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on a point of law such
    that the decision should be set aside and remade.  There  is  no  basis
    either under the Immigration Rules or article 8 private life  to  allow
    the appeal. The appeal should have been  dismissed  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
