For the Respondent:    Mr Z Nasim, Counsel instructed by Maher & Co
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of birth  13th  November
      1982.

   2. The history of this matter is not straightforward; it is necessary  to
      set it out in some detail.  The Respondent came to the UK  with  leave
      to enter as a  Religious  Worker  in  October  2006,  leave  that  was
      subsequently  extended.   On  the  17th  September  2008   a   further
      application for leave in the same capacity was refused because he  was
      approaching the 24 month maximum period of stay under that rule.   The
      Respondent initially appealed that decision but subsequently withdrew.
      On the 27th October 2008 he applied for leave to remain as a  Minister
      of Religion. That application was refused, his appeal dismissed and by
      May 2009 the Respondent was  an  overstayer  with  all  appeal  rights
      exhausted.

   3. On the 13th November 2010 the Respondent made an application for leave
      to remain 'outside of the Rules'. This was refused, with no  right  of
      appeal, on the 24th November 2010. On the 19th February 2011  he  made
      an application for leave to remain as a Tier 2 (Minister of  Religion)
      Migrant. His "points based system" sponsor was Reading Islamic Centre.
        That application was refused on the 4th April 2011. The Respondent's
      representatives submitted a pre-action protocol  letter  to  the  Home
      Office inviting reconsideration on the grounds that the Respondent met
      all of the requirements of the Rules, and in the alternative that  his
      removal would be an unlawful interference with his Article  8  rights.
      When  the  Secretary  of  State  declined  to  change  her  mind,  the
      Respondent issued judicial review proceedings.

   4. When the matter came before  Wyn  Williams  J  the  point  upon  which
      permission had been granted was a narrow one.  Had  the  Secretary  of
      State unlawfully failed to  exercise  her  discretion  and  grant  the
      Respondent leave to remain outside of the Rules, taking  into  account
      all relevant evidence including the views of numerous  worshippers  at
      the Reading Islamic Centre  and  the  parents  of  children  receiving
      religious instruction by the Respondent.  This latter feature  of  the
      case was framed in the context of s55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and
      Immigration Act 2009,  ie  the  best  interests  of  the  Respondent's
      pupils; the wider argument was based on the authority of EU  (Nigeria)
      v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ  975  to  the  effect  that  detriment  to  the
      community can be a relevant factor when considering proportionality.

   5. Wyn Williams J dismissed the claim on the 31st May 2012. He held  that
      the Secretary of State had had regard to the wider  interests  of  the
      Muslim community in Reading when she  reached  her  decision,  and  in
      respect of the s55 argument he said this:

           "... it could not sensibly be inferred  from  the  very  limited
           information which was provided to the  Defendant  in  this  case
           that the Claimant's skills were not easily replaceable within  a
           comparatively short time by an alternative Imam".

   6. Attempts to challenge the decision of Wyn Williams  J  failed  in  the
      Court of Appeal.

   7. The Secretary of State  served  a  s10  removal  notice  on  the  11th
      November 2013, with a right of appeal. It was that decision which  led
      to the appeal coming before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Cresswell).



   8. On  appeal  the  Respondent  conceded  that  he  could  not  meet  the
      requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Rules  and  relied  solely  on
      human rights arguments: Article 8 'outside of the Rules', and  Article
      9. The argument advanced, and accepted, was that  the  Respondent  was
      such an asset to the Muslim community  of  Reading  that  his  removal
      would be to their detriment.  The  Tribunal  directed  itself  to  the
      authorities of UE Nigeria and Bakhtaur Singh [1996] 1 WLR  910  before
      considering the evidence. The Respondent had received written  support
      from numerous members of the community in Reading,  including  an  MP,
      councillors,  Reading  Islamic  Centre,  the  Thames   Valley   Police
      Community and Diversity Officer and the parents and  children  at  the
      madrassa: "it was an unusually  high  level  of  support  for  someone
      facing removal".  Nine of these supporters  attended  the  hearing  to
      give  evidence.   Having  heard  that   evidence   the   Home   Office
      representative accepted that the Respondent was a highly regarded  man
      "who had made a real difference to his community".  The Tribunal noted
      in particular the evidence that the Respondent was active in promoting
      integration, tolerance and respect, and  that  Councillor  Hussain  of
      Reading Council had recognised his role in  "ensuring  that  Reading's
      Islamic community remains largely free of radical influence".

   9. All of that led the Tribunal to conclude that the Respondent's removal
      would be an interference with his Article 9 rights, in particular  his
      right to manifest his religious belief by being a spiritual guide  and
      youth leader to Muslims in Reading; the Secretary of State had  failed
      to show that interference  to  be  proportionate.   Even  taking  into
      account the fact that for the vast majority of the time  he  had  been
      there he had no lawful status, the bond between  the  Reading  Islamic
      Centre and the Respondent was so deep that his removal would  have  an
      adverse impact "on the "right of exercise by a religious  organisation
      (itself or its  members  collectively)  of  the  Convention  right  to
      freedom of thought, conscience or religion".   The appeal was  allowed
      on Article 9 grounds.

  10. In respect of Article 8 the Tribunal properly reminded itself that the
      Respondent had failed to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  and
      referred itself to Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640. Proceeding  to  the  final
      Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 stage the determination finds as follows:

           "I find that this is an Appellant who came to the UK without any
           hope of staying unless he could meet  the  requirements  of  the
           Rules, who has obtained benefits from his stay  whilst  building
           his private life, but who has built that  private  life  in  the
           knowledge that there was a real likelihood he would not be  able
           to  remain.   He  has  deliberately  overstayed.  He  would   be
           returning to a country whose culture he was  familiar  with  and
           with a new language qualification  and  greater  experience  and
           skills. Any friendships and associations formed in the UK can be
           continued, albeit in a  different  manner  and  at  a  different
           level, using modern means of communication. I do not  find  that
           the refusal of leave to remain prejudices the  private  life  of
           the Appellant in a manner sufficiently serious to  amount  to  a
           breach of the fundamental right protected by Article 8"

      The appeal was dismissed on Article 8 grounds.

  11. The Secretary of State sought  permission  to  appeal  the  Article  9
      decision.  It  is  submitted  that  the  Judge  "entirely  misdirected
      himself" as to the applicable law.  In summary the Secretary of  State
      accepts that the right to hold a religious  belief  is  absolute,  but
      that the right to manifest one's religious belief can be qualified[1].
      It is submitted that on the facts of the case the Secretary  of  State
      had shown the Respondent's removal proportionate, since he could carry
      on being a tolerant religious  leader  in  Pakistan.   Permission  was
      initially refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies, but was granted
      upon renewed application by Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds.

  12. The matter was set down for hearing before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
      Drabu who heard, and refused, the Respondent's  oral  application  for
      permission to cross appeal the Article 8 decision.   That  application
      was renewed, and refused by Upper Tribunal Judge  Grubb  on  the  25th
      September 2014.

  13. So it was that when the matter came before me the only live issue  was
      whether Judge Cresswell had erred in law in his approach to Article 9.

      Error of Law

  14. Before me Mr Nasim and Ms Holmes  were  more  in  agreement  than  the
      convoluted history set out above might have suggested.

  15. Both agreed that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  in  its
      approach to Article 9 insofar as it  would  appear  that  the  removal
      decision in respect of the Respondent was found to be unlawful because
      of, or largely because of, the  interference  with  the  Article  9(1)
      rights of Muslims in Reading, none of whom were parties to the appeal.
      The Tribunal had concluded that the Secretary of State  could not show
      the interference to be necessary in pursuit of any of  the  legitimate
      aims set out in Article 9(1) but this rather missed the point.  It was
      open to the Tribunal to allow the appeal on purely Article  9  grounds
      but only if it found removal would result in a "flagrant" interference
      with the Article 9 rights of the  Respondent  himself:  Ullah  and  Do
      [2004]  UKHL  26.    There  is  no  finding  to  that  effect  in  the
      determination, which focuses on the  positive  relationship  that  the
      Respondent enjoys with his supporters. Nowhere has the Tribunal turned
      its mind  to  how  the  Respondent  might  continue  to  manifest  his
      religious belief in Pakistan, nor how  his  pupils  might  fare  under
      another teacher, as considered by Wyn Williams J when he rejected this
      same argument as long ago as 2011.

  16. Mr Nasim and Ms Holmes were also however in agreement that  the  facts
      found by the First-tier Tribunal were reasonable and open to it on the
      evidence, and that all of these  factual  findings  were  relevant  to
      consideration of Article 9 considered in conjunction with  Article  8.
      The reasoning at paragraph 26 of the determination  (cited  above)  is
      perfectly sustainable, but reading the determination as a whole it  is
      difficult to see how the reasoning in respect of 'community detriment'
      - and indeed Article 9 - could have  been  properly  excluded  in  the
      Article 8 proportionality balancing exercise. In this way,  Ms  Holmes
      conceded that the Respondent's Article 8 arguments get in through "the
      back door".

  17. Having set out these agreed matters the parties invited me to  re-make
      the decision on the evidence before me.

      The Re-Made Decision

  18. Article 9 reads:

          'Article 9 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion

          1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,  conscience  and
             religion; this right includes freedom to change  his  religion
             or belief and freedom,  either  alone  or  in  community  with
             others and in public or private, to manifest his  religion  or
             belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.

          2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject
             only to such limitations as are  prescribed  by  law  and  are
             necessary in a democratic society in the interests  of  public
             safety, for the protection of public order, health or  morals,
             or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.'

  19. There is limited authority on the reliance upon Article 9  in  removal
      cases. As I note above the lead case is  Ullah  and  Do,  wherein  the
      House of Lords held that in order to resist removal on purely  Article
      9 grounds the interference with the right  in  the  receiving  country
      would need to be "a flagrant violation of  the  very  essence  of  the
      right" [per Lord Steyn at paragraph  50]  or  a  "flagrant,  gross  or
      fundamental breach" of that article [per Lord Carswell at 70].

  20. As the facts as found by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  indeed  the
      evidence, shows, it could not be said that the Respondent's removal to
      Pakistan would be a flagrant interference  with  his  right  to  be  a
      Muslim, and a tolerant exponent of that faith.   Nor can it  be  said,
      on the evidence that his departure from  Reading  would  result  in  a
      "gross or fundamental" breach of the Article 9(1)  rights  of  others.
      As Wyn Williams J observed, the evidence fells short  of  establishing
      that the Reading Islamic Centre would  not  be  able  to  replace  the
      Respondent with an alternative Imam within a relatively  short  period
      of time. It is no doubt  the  case  that  his  pupils  will  suffer  a
      temporary setback in their learning if he is replaced, they  may  like
      him  and  miss  him,  but  this  does  not  represent  a   significant
      interference with their right to manifest their  religion  or  worship
      collectively.  These are matters relevant - although not determinative
      - to the  consideration  of  proportionality  under  Article  9:   see
      paragraph  83  Eweida.  However  without  any  long  term  significant
      detriment  to  the  Respondent's  Article  9  rights  upon  return  to
      Pakistan, his case under that head must fail.

  21. To what extent might the decision under Article 8 be different if  the
      rights of the Muslims at the Reading Islamic Centre have been  weighed
      in the balance along with the matters very properly taken into account
      by the First-tier Tribunal?   I agree with Mr Nasim - and  I  did  not
      understand Ms Holmes to challenge this submission - that the detriment
      to the community discussed in Bakhtaur Singh and EU  (Nigeria)  was  a
      matter that should, according to those authorities, have  featured  in
      the proportionality balancing exercise.

  22. I have considered the facts as found by the First-tier  Tribunal.  The
      Respondent clearly has been  an  asset  to  the  Muslim  community  in
      Reading and that a great many people think  a  good  deal  of  him  is
      evident from the large bundle of  witness  statements,  petitions  and
      letters in support which has been provided. Significant weight can  be
      attached to that fact.  It remains the case however that for  all  but
      2� of the 8� years that the Respondent has spent in  the  UK,  he  has
      been here unlawfully.  Section 117B(4) of Nationality, Immigration and
      Asylum Act 2002 (as amended by  the  Immigration  Act)  mandates  that
      decision-makers must therefore place "little weight"  on  his  private
      life in those circumstances. This is an applicant who has  known  that
      he has no further basis to remain in the UK since 2010. Mr Nasim urged
      me  to  find  that  he  had  become  an  overstayer   because   of   a
      "technicality" arising from the changeover between the old  Rules  and
      the Points Based System. Although he declined to frame this as a 'near
      miss' argument, this is, in effect, what it was.  The  Respondent  did
      not then, or now, meet the requirements of the Rules. Had he  returned
      to Pakistan in 2010 and made an application  under  the  Points  Based
      System this would no doubt have been successful. That he chose not  to
      do this is a matter  for  him,  and  all  of  his  relationships,  the
      foundation of his private life in Reading, must be viewed through that
      prism.  Having taken all of those circumstances into  account  I  find
      that the Secretary of State has  shown  the  decision  to  remove  the
      Respondent to be proportionate and lawful.

      Decisions

  23. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of  law
      and it is set aside.

  24. I remake the decision by dismissing the appeal.

  25. I make no direction for anonymity.
