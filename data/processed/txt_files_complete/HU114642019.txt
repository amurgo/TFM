                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's  human  rights  appeal.
    The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria.



Background

 2. The claimant and her husband are  long-term  overstayers.   The  couple
    married in Nigeria by traditional customary  marriage.  The  claimant's
    husband has been in the United Kingdom for more than 20 years  and  now
    has discretionary leave to remain. The claimant  joined  him  in  2003.
    Both the claimant and her partner entered the United Kingdom  on  visit
    visas, but did not embark for Nigeria when they expired.

 3. The claimant has been unlawfully in the United Kingdom since  her  visa
    expired on 19 October 2004 when she was 31 years old.  The claimant  is
    47 now.  Her husband supports them both financially and his  income  is
    over ï¿½18600.  Her parents in Nigeria have died. The claimant has a  son
    still living in Nigeria from a previous relationship, but is  estranged
    from him.  The claimant has two adult children in the  United  Kingdom,
    and a grand-daughter, all of whom are settled here.

 4. The claimant's husband is on the 10-year route  to  settlement,  having
    been granted discretionary leave pursuant to  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iii)
    based on 20 years' residence, in 2016.  He has had two 30-month  grants
    of discretionary leave, the first in September  2016  and  the  second,
    last year, in March 2019, which will expire in September 2021.  If  all
    goes well, he could apply for indefinite leave to remain in 2026.

 5.  On  27  April  2016,  the  claimant  was  encountered  by  immigration
    officials, served with forms RED.0001  and  RED.0003  and  issued  with
    temporary admission.

 6. On 3 June 2016, the claimant made an application for leave to remain on
    private life grounds, but this was  refused  on  1  November  2016  and
    certified as clearly unfounded under section  94  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).  The claimant had only an
    out of country right of appeal which she did not pursue.  She  did  not
    embark for Nigeria, remaining unlawfully in the United Kingdom.

 7. On 5 October  2017,  the  claimant  made  a  private  and  family  life
    application, citing  her  relationship  with  her  husband,  her  adult
    children, and her grand-daughter.

 8. On 14 March 2019, the Secretary  of  State  gave  the  husband  further
    discretionary leave, to expire in September 2021.

 9. Just over 2 months later, on 21  June  2019,  the  Secretary  of  State
    refused the claimant's private and family life application, noting that
    the claimant's husband, although he had paragraph 276ADE leave, was not
    a British citizen, settled, or in the United Kingdom  on  international
    protection  grounds  (refugee  or    humanitarian   protection).    The
    Secretary  of  State  rejected  the  claimant's  assertion   that   her
    relationship with her husband was genuine and subsisting, and  did  not
    consider that she had family life either with her  husband,  her  adult
    children here, or her grand-daughter.

10. All of the relationships with her adult children and grandchildren were
    considered to be private life, not family life, and to have been formed
    at a time when the claimant was unlawfully in the United Kingdom,  such
    that under section 117B of the 2002 Act, they  could  be  given  little
    weight.

11. The  Secretary  of  State  did  not  consider  that  the  claimant  had
    demonstrated  that  exceptional  circumstances  existed  in  her  case:
    although the claimant had some health difficulties while she was  here,
    there were health systems in  Nigeria  which   were  adequate  and  the
    Article 3 ECHR standard of risk was not reached.

12. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

13. On 31 October 2019, the First-tier Judge  found  as  a  fact  that  the
    claimant and her husband were in a genuine and subsisting relationship;
    the respondent has not challenged that  finding.   By  that  date,  the
    claimant's partner had received his second grant of discretionary leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom.  Their children and grandchildren were
    lawfully in the United Kingdom, and the Judge  found  that  the  entire
    extended family was settled and  integrated.    There  was  uncontested
    evidence that the claimant's partner's income exceeded the Appendix  FM
    threshold.  The Secretary of State accepted that  the  claimant  speaks
    English and that she would not fail the Suitability test.

14. The First-tier Judge applied the test in Agyarko and Ikuga, R  (on  the
    applications of) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2017]
    UKSC 11  and considered both the  positives  and  the  negatives  on  a
    'balance sheet' test (see [14]-[15] in the Tribunal's  decision).   The
    core of the First-tier Tribunal's decision is at [16]-[17]:

         "16. In the Tribunal's view, once  the  [Secretary  of  State]  had
         decided to grant the [claimant's] husband  discretionary  leave  to
         remain, there was no utility in not granting similar  discretionary
         leave to remain to the [claimant].  Both were closely related  long
         term overstayers whom the [Secretary of  State]  had  not  removed,
         doubtless a pragmatic decision, but one which  cannot  be  seen  as
         encouraging respect for the law,  and  one  which  has  undoubtedly
         imposed burdens on public services.

         17.  In all the circumstances, the [Secretary of State's]  decision
         to treat the [claimant] differently from her partner cannot be seen
         as proportionate and in pursuit of  a  legitimate  objective  under
         Article 8.2 ECHR.  The appeal is therefore allowed."

15. The First-tier Judge  allowed  the  appeal.   The  Secretary  of  State
    appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

16. The Secretary of State  challenged  the  reasoning  in  the  First-tier
    Judge's decision on the basis that he had  neither  mentioned  nor  had
    regard to section 117B of the 2002 Act, that the claimant's husband was
    granted leave to remain on a different basis, because he had been  able
    to show that he was in the United Kingdom for longer than 20  years  in
    2016, that there was no reason, despite the grant of leave to him,  why
    he should not be expected to return to Nigeria 'with some finances  and
    support from family there' to take up employment  and  live  with  this
    claimant in their country of origin.

17. The grounds of appeal asserted that there was an  unresolved  issue  in
    the First-tier Tribunal about the  existence  and/or  presence  of  the
    claimant's adult children and her grandchildren in the United  Kingdom.
    That issue was not pursued at the Upper Tribunal  hearing,  Mr  Bramble
    accepting that the issue, although present in the refusal  letter,  had
    not been argued or relied upon before the First-tier Judge.

18. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  Designated  First-tier  Judge
    McClure, who after setting out the grounds of appeal, said this by  way
    of grant:

         "2.  Whilst it has to be acknowledged that the [claimant's] partner
         had been given leave in the United  Kingdom  such  leave  was  only
         discretionary leave and the partner was not settled in  the  United
         Kingdom.  In such circumstances section 117B had to be  taken  into
         account not only with regard to finances and English  language  but
         also  that  the  relationship  in  the  United  Kingdom  had   been
         established when both the [claimant]  and  the  sponsor  were  here
         without leave.  It is arguable that the Judge has  failed  properly
         to consider section 117B.

         3.   In the circumstances, the ground can be argued."

19. The grant of permission appears to be limited to section 117B.

Rule 24 Reply

20. There was no Rule 24 Reply on behalf of the claimant.

21. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

22. Mr Bramble relied on the refusal letter and the grounds of  appeal  and
    asked me to allow the Secretary of  State's  appeal  and  substitute  a
    decision dismissing the claimant's challenge to her decision.

23. For the claimant, Mr Slatter drew my attention  to the judgment of  the
    Court of Appeal in GM (Sri Lanka) v The Secretary of State for the Home
    Department  (Rev  1)  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1630  (04  October  2019),  in
    particular at [45]-[53], and to  Dube  (ss.117A-117D)  [2015]  UKUT  90
    (IAC) which  deals with how part VA of the 2002 Act should  be  applied
    by the First-tier Tribunal and Upper  Tribunal.   Mr  Slatter  observed
    that as the claimant's husband was not a qualified person, section 117B
    was inapplicable here and it could not therefore be an error of law for
    the Judge to have failed to apply it.  This  appeal  had  succeeded  on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds outside the Rules.

Analysis

24. The point on which permission to appeal was granted was that the  Judge
    had failed to deal with Section  117B(4)(b)  of  the  2002  Act.   That
    argument is misconceived:  section 117B(4)(b) applies only  to  require
    that little weight be  given  to  family  life  developed  between  the
    claimant and a qualified person.   The  claimant's  husband  is  not  a
    qualified  person  as  defined  in  section  117D.      The   statutory
    requirement to give  'little  weight'  to  their  relationship  is  not
    engaged and the First-tier Judge made no error of  law  in  failing  to
    consider section 117B, impliedly or expressly.

25. There is no explanation given in the refusal letter or the Secretary of
    State's  submissions  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  other  than   the
    difference in their length of stay (over 20 years for him, 16 for  her)
    as to why the Secretary of State considers that it is proportionate  to
    separate this couple or to require the husband to forgo the possibility
    of becoming settled in the United Kingdom.

26. I have considered the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in GM  (Sri
    Lanka) in the judgment of Lord Justice Greene, with whom  Lady  Justice
    Simler agreed:

         "52. In our judgment the Judge did err. It was made  clear  by  the
         Supreme Court in Ali (supra) that even if  it  is  practicable  and
         feasible for a person to return that is not the end of the story  -
         proportionality  must  also  be  considered  which  necessitates  a
         careful analysis of  the  fair  balance  that  exists  between  the
         State's  interest  in  immigration  control  and  the  individual's
         interests. As Mr Jafferji pointed out in this case  the  State  had
         accorded the husband and the children DLR and  they  were  (at  the
         time of the FTT hearing) on a pathway to settled  status  and  this
         being so, the State had no discernible, sensible, objection to  the
         husband and children being in the United Kingdom. This was relevant
         to any assessment of the proportionality of compelling  the  father
         and children to move  to  Sri  Lanka  if  family  life  was  to  be
         preserved.

         53.  In this case the Judge did not say that  she  was  considering
         the "reasonableness" of the husband  leaving  and  instead  focused
         upon whether he had the ability / capability to move to Sri  Lanka:
         see FTT paragraph [46]. ... There will  of  course  be  some  nexus
         between the two concepts, but they are not the same: a person might
         be able to return to a foreign  country,  yet  it  might  still  be
         unreasonable or disproportionate to compel  return.  The  point  is
         made for the Appellant that if her husband  and  children  were  to
         follow her then they would lose their leave to remain and  with  it
         the chance (which of course did materialise) of settled  status  in
         the UK. There is no analysis of whether in such circumstances  this
         was  proportionate  or  reasonable  for  the  husband  or  for  the
         children."

                                                            [Emphasis added]

27. In this appeal, the husband risks losing the chance of  settled  status
    to which his paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) would lead. Since he does not yet
    have settled status, it would be some years before  the  husband  could
    support an entry clearance application.  If the claimant  were  removed
    to Nigeria, her husband would have to choose between going with her and
    breaking his long connections in the United Kingdom, or allowing her to
    return alone, knowing that he could  not  sponsor  an  application  for
    entry clearance until 2026 at the earliest.

28. In my judgment, the First-tier Judge did  not  err  in  assessing  that
    after such a long period of joint cohabitation, it was unreasonable and
    disproportionate to expect the appellant to return alone or  to  expect
    the husband to forgo  the  possibility  of  settlement  in  the  United
    Kingdom, which has been his home since at least 1996.

29. The First-tier Judge's decision was open to him  on  the  evidence  and
    arguments before her.  There is no want of reasoning, nor any  material
    error of law therein.  I uphold his decision.



DECISION

30. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law.

    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
