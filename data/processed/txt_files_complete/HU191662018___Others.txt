Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr A Malik, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The first and second Appellants are wife and husband and the third  and
    fourth Appellants are their children. They appealed against a  decision
    of the Respondent on 4 September 2018 refusing to grant them  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom.

 2. That appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Wright  who,
    in a decision  promulgated  on  24  January  2019,  dismissed  it.  The
    Appellants sought permission to appeal which was initially refused  but
    a renewed application was made and granted by Upper Tribunal Judge G  A
    Black in a decision dated 22 May 2019. Her reasons for so doing were: -

         "1.  The appellants,  who  are  citizens  of  Philippine,  appealed
         against the respondent's decision made on 4.9.2018 to refuse  their
         human rights claims based on applications for leave to remain under
         the immigration Rules (private life) and Article 8  ECHR.  The  3rd
         and 4th appellants (born on 27.12.2010 & 6.3.2005 respectively) are
         "qualified" children.

         2.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Wright (FTTJ) dismissed the  appeals
         in a decision promulgated on 24th January 2018. The FTTJ found that
         it was reasonable for the two children (3rd &  4th  appellants)  to
         return to the Philippines and that section 117B(6) did not apply.

         3.    Permission  was  refused  by  First-tier  Judge   Saffer   on
         18.2.2019.

         4.   The grounds argue that the FTJ erred in concluding that the  7
         year period applied at the date of application rather than  at  the
         date of hearing. The FTJ failed to consider paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)
         and EX 1(a). The 4th appellant will complete her 10 year  residence
         requirement  in  December  2020  and  be  eligible  to  apply   for
         citizenship. The FTJ failed to  take  into  account  principles  in
         Azimi-Moayed  &  others  (decisions  affecting   children;   onward
         appeals) 2013 UKUT 197 (IAC). The FTJ failed to give proper  regard
         to the issue of where the best interests of the children  lie.  The
         FTJ failed to appreciate that the previous decision and reasons was
         a starting point. The FTJ failed to  properly  consider  Article  8
         outside of the Rules  and  the  approach  under  section  117B  was
         flawed. The reasoning given was inadequate.

         5.   The grounds of appeal have merit and all are arguable."

 3. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 4. At the outset Ms Cunha conceded that the Judge had materially erred for
    all the reasons set out in the  grounds  and  grant  of  permission  to
    appeal and that as a consequence the Respondent invited  me  to  remake
    the decision in relation to all four appeals by allowing them on  human
    rights grounds.

 5. Mr Malik, in the circumstances,  did  not  address  me  at  length.  He
    invited me to allow the appeal for the reasons stated by Ms  Cunha.  He
    emphasised ground (d) of the grounds seeking permission to  appeal  and
    the references there to how the First-tier Tribunal Judge  should  have
    given proper regard to the third and fourth Appellants' best  interests
    and the case law therein cited.

 6. In the circumstances I am effectively faced with a consent  application
    which invites me to set Judge Wright's decision  aside  and  allow  the
    appeal. That, I find, considering the factual  matrix  found  by  Judge
    Wright is the way forward.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in these appeals by allowing them.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of ï¿½140.00.
