                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 5th February 1987.   The
    Appellant appeals with permission against the decision  of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  who  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  for  want  of
    jurisdiction  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  15th  April  2013.
    Permission has been granted on all grounds by Judge Nightingale on  8th
    May 2013 in which she considered it was arguable that the finding  that
    there had been a concession as to payment of the appropriate  fee  with
    the initial application had been  wrongly  made  and  that  the  "judge
    failed to appreciate the Respondent bore the burden with regard to  the
    production of the evidence of non-payment of the appropriate fee".

 2. The salient facts of the appeal are  as  follows.   The  Appellant  was
    granted leave to enter the UK as a student  on  13th  March  2011  such
    leave being valid until 21st  April  2012.   On  21st  April  2012,  he
    applied for an extension of his visa by way of recorded delivery.  This
    was returned with a letter dated 24th April from the Respondent  noting
    "invalid immigration application" the reason given that the appropriate
    new fee had not been received with this  attempted  application.   Thus
    the application was considered to  be  invalid.   The  application  was
    resubmitted on 28th April with the fee again.  The application was  the
    same application that had been made previously in all material aspects,
    namely an application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student
    Migrant under the points-based system.   The  Appellant  heard  nothing
    more until the Secretary of State issued a decision on this application
    on 31st December 2012.  The application  was  refused  under  paragraph
    322(1A) with reference to paragraph 245ZX(a) of the Immigration  Rules.
    It was noted by the Respondent  that  the  Appellant  had  submitted  a
    letter from the National Savings Centre dated 10th April  2012  in  the
    account name Khurram Shahzad with account number  SA-0002321  and  that
    the Secretary of State was satisfied that the document was a false  one
    because after checks with the concerned branch  confirmation  had  been
    received that the letter was not authentic nor had it  been  issued  by
    the concerned branch.  In the light of that information the bank letter
    had found to be "not genuine".  As a false document had been  submitted
    in relation to the application, it was refused under paragraph  322(1A)
    of the Immigration Rules.  Thus it was also noted  that  the  Appellant
    could not satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules under  Tier
    4 under paragraph 245ZX(a) or 245ZX(d).  For  the  above  reasons,  the
    Respondent was satisfied that he had used deception  which  meant  that
    any future applications for entry clearance or leave to  enter  the  UK
    would be refused under paragraph 320(7B) of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The letter further set out that the application dated  28th  April  was
    made after the leave had expired and thus he had no leave to  enter  at
    the time and thus there was also no right of appeal.

 4. Grounds of Appeal were filed on behalf of the Appellant and in light of
    the refusal letter stating that there was no valid  appeal  the  matter
    came before the  Duty  Judge,  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Clark)  at
    Leicester.  He provided a determination dealing with  the  validity  of
    the appeal and in the determination promulgated 25th January  2013  the
    judge considered the Grounds of Appeal and in particular  the  decision
    of Basnet (validity of application  -  respondent)  Nepal  [2012]  UKUT
    00113 (IAC) which determined that if the Respondent  asserted  that  an
    application was not accompanied by a fee, and so  was  not  valid,  the
    Respondent had the onus of proof.  Further the Respondent's system,  of
    processing  payments  of  postal  applications  risked   falling   into
    procedural unfairness.  The judge noted at paragraph 5 that he followed
    that decision and directed the Respondent  to  provide  information  to
    determine whether  the  application  was  accompanied  by  a  fee.   He
    considered there was a right of appeal as he had  submitted  the  first
    application at a time when he had leave to remain thus he  found  there
    to be a valid appeal.

 5. It is common ground between the parties that the Respondent  failed  to
    comply with that direction made by the First-tier Tribunal  in  January
    2013.

 6. The matter came before the Tribunal on 9th April and it considered as a
    preliminary issue whether the Tribunal had  jurisdiction  to  entertain
    the appeal, noting that the application for leave to remain was made on
    28th April after his leave  had  expired  on  21st  April.   The  judge
    however considered that there were arguments capable of being  advanced
    on behalf of the Appellant in the  light  of  the  decision  of  Basnet
    (already referred to and cited herein).

 7. It is recorded at paragraph 4 that Mr Khan  (who  was  then  the  legal
    representative) conceded that on instructions the first application had
    been accompanied by  a  bank  authorisation  to  pay  a  sum  that  was
    insufficient to the relevant fee.  Thus the judge acting on that  found
    that the application was invalid and then distinguished the  case  from
    that of Basnet (see paragraph 5).

 8. The Appellant sought permission to appeal.  The grounds are relied upon
    by Mr Islam before the Upper Tribunal.  In  the  grounds  a  number  of
    matters were asserted. I need not set them all out here but the salient
    points are as follows.  The Appellant had produced the correct  account
    details and had showed that funds were in his account at  the  time  he
    submitted it on 21st April.  The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Clark  had
    found the application was valid and issued directions to the Respondent
    in accordance with the  decision  in  Basnet  to  file  evidence.   The
    direction had never been complied with.  The grounds  stated  that  the
    judge's recording of the concession was wrongly stated and that Mr Khan
    had made no concession on behalf  of  the  Appellant  that  there  were
    insufficient funds in the account.   Furthermore,  the  grounds  assert
    that the judge misdirected himself in law by asking  the  Appellant  to
    give evidence of fees and that the burden  was  on  the  Respondent  to
    prove the application was not accompanied by the correct fee.

 9. In the light of the issues concerning the  concession,  the  judge  was
    asked to provide his Record of Proceedings.  There is a letter  in  the
    bundle dated 26th May.  The judge had not retained his  contemporaneous
    Record of Proceedings and there was not one in the file.   However,  by
    considering the determination he stated that he had not suggested  that
    there were insufficient funds in the  account.   At  paragraph  4,  the
    concession that he was saying had been made was to the effect that  the
    first application was accompanied  by  payment  in  the  sum  that  was
    inappropriate to the previous scale of fees, in circumstances where the
    Appellant was presumably unaware that  they  had  been  increased  some
    eighteen days prior to submission.  He also  stated  he  was  happy  to
    confirm the representative did not  concede  that  funds  in  the  bank
    account were insufficient to meet the appropriate fee.  He  said  "  It
    would therefore appear that there has been a degree of misunderstanding
    about this between myself and the representative at the hearing."

10. Whilst the grounds refer to the concession being made that  there  were
    insufficient funds in the Appellant's account, it  is  plain  from  the
    determination  that  what  was  recorded  did   not   relate   to   the
    insufficiency of funds but the inappropriate fee (see  paragraph  4  of
    the determination).  The grant of permission made reference to Mr  Khan
    being available before the Upper  Tribunal  and  to  make  a  statement
    attaching his Record  of  Proceedings  as  an  exhibit.   Mr  Khan,  in
    accordance with the directions did attend the hearing and had  prepared
    a witness statement exhibited at page  19.   There  was  no  Record  of
    Proceedings available according to Mr Islam.

11. Mr Islam submitted that the judge had  misdirected  himself  concerning
    the burden of proof which was  on  the  Respondent  to  show  that  the
    application  had  been  accompanied  by  the  appropriate   fee.    The
    Respondent had not complied  with  the  directions  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and still had provided no evidence in support  of  this.   The
    Appellant had not retained the application form and  could  not  recall
    the amount paid not without  having  had  sight  of  the  form  or  any
    evidence.  As set out  in  the  statement  of  Mr  Khan  the  Appellant
    provided his bank details but did not remember the  exact  amount.   He
    invited the Tribunal to look at the Appellant's bank account  and  that
    it was clearly demonstrated at the time he had sufficient monies in the
    account, indeed the account  was  in  funds  of  nearly  �4,000,  which
    supports the claim that he had sent an appropriate fee.

12. I asked  Mr  Khan  to  deal  with  the  issue  concerning  the  alleged
    concession.  He submitted  that  it  had  been  disputed  by  both  the
    Appellant and Mr Khan that there was a concession on instructions  that
    the first application had been accompanied by a bank  authorisation  to
    pay a sum that was insufficient with a relevant fee.  He submitted that
    there must have been a misunderstanding on this  issue  and  there  had
    been no interpreter present (this being a preliminary  issue)  and  the
    Appellant did not speak very good English.  I asked if Mr Islam  had  a
    copy of any note on his file  and  he  said  that  there  was  no  note
    available.  As recorded previously there was no Record  of  Proceedings
    of the judge either.  I therefore asked Mr Diwnycz if there was a  note
    from the Presenting Officer.  He provided what was a short  note  which
    after  the  parties  having  read  it,  did  not   decide   the   issue
    authoritatively either way.  It is  recorded  "A  accepts  he  did  not
    submit correct fee" it is also noted "applicant does not speak  English
    very well".

13. There is a difference from the concession recorded at paragraph 4 which
    is that  Mr  Khan  conceded  on  instructions  whereas  the  Presenting
    Officer's note is that the Appellant accepted that he  did  not  submit
    the correct fee.  It is also noted that the  Appellant  did  not  speak
    English very well and therefore supports  Mr  Islam's  submission  that
    there may have been a misunderstanding  as  there  was  no  interpreter
    present and the Appellant was having difficulty.   Thus  in  accordance
    with the directions Mr Islam called Mr Khan to give some oral evidence.
     In that evidence he gave an account that the Appellant told  him  that
    he had paid the appropriate fee at the time but could not remember  how
    much he paid or from what account.  Mr Islam submitted that  there  had
    been a degree of misunderstanding  and  that  there  may  have  been  a
    language problem and that there had  been  no  evidence  and  still  no
    evidence concerning the application form and the fee paid  despite  the
    Appellant's account that he had sufficient funds at the time to pay any
    such fee.

14. Mr Diwnycz having examined the file acknowledged that there was no copy
    on the Respondent's file of any Tier 4 application made on  21st  April
    2013 and therefore he could not say  what  was  in  the  form  or  what
    accompanied that form.  Nor was there any information  concerning  what
    fee was paid or in what circumstances.  He  further  acknowledged  that
    the direction issued by the First-tier Tribunal in January had not been
    complied with and that there was no evidence at the hearing before  the
    First-tier Tribunal or before the Upper Tribunal  to  demonstrate  what
    evidence the Respondent had acted upon.  As to  the  determination,  he
    stated that the judge had distinguished Basnet and that he would  adopt
    that reasoning but that he had a reasonable concern that there may have
    been a misunderstanding which in part was backed up by  the  Presenting
    Officer's note.

15. I therefore have considered this appeal in the light of the information
    and evidence set out above.  It seems to me that using the words of  Mr
    Diwnycz there was a reasonable chance that there was a misunderstanding
    of what had been recorded at  the  hearing.   It  is  difficult  to  be
    certain on this issue and I do not feel that I can make any finding  as
    there  is  no  Record  of  Proceedings  from  Mr  Khan,  no  Record  of
    Proceedings from the judge and only a short note  from  the  Presenting
    Officer which I have referred to earlier which in  part  supports  what
    was said at paragraph 4 of the judge's determination but also  in  part
    supports what Mr Islam had  submitted  concerning  the  nature  of  the
    misunderstanding.  Certainly there is no note of any official  evidence
    given by the Appellant and it is not said by anyone that he was  called
    to give formal evidence.  This  is  not  surprising  as  there  was  no
    interpreter present  and  the  Presenting  Officer  recorded  that  his
    English was not very good.  Thus I cannot therefore be  certain  as  to
    what happened at the hearing and  in  those  circumstances  I  exercise
    caution.  I remind myself that the basis of the decision on its  merits
    related to a serious allegation of deception made by the Appellant  and
    one that if proved is one in which paragraph 320(7B) applies and  would
    mean that he would  not  be  able  to  make  any  further  application.
    Therefore, having exercised caution the finding made falls away I  have
    to consider whether it has been demonstrated that there was an  invalid
    application initially made.

16.   In this regard I have considered the decision of Basnet  (as  cited).
    In this case the Respondent had been specifically directed  to  produce
    evidence inline in that decision and had  not  complied  with  it.   No
    reason has been given for that non-compliance and before this  Tribunal
    today there is still no evidence in either the  original  form  or  the
    earlier evidence as to the circumstances of the payment or what payment
    had been made.  There is no requirement for the  Appellant  to  produce
    evidence.  The decision of Basnet makes it  clear  that  the  issue  of
    validity  depends  not  upon  whether  the  payment  was   successfully
    processed but whether the application  was  accompanied  by  the  valid
    authorisation to obtain the fee (see paragraphs 18  and  20).   In  the
    decision the Tribunal set out the Respondent's standard  procedures  at
    paragraph 22 and noted that there was no record of what went wrong with
    the payment that could be provided to the  Tribunal.   It  was  against
    that background that the Tribunal considered that  the  current  system
    puts the evidence beyond the future reach by the party in the  Tribunal
    (paragraph 26) when considering what would be the "best  evidence"  and
    whether an application was accompanied by the fee.  In  that  case  the
    Tribunal has given advanced notice that the Respondent had produced the
    billing data page.  In relation to this appeal it was  acknowledged  on
    behalf of the Respondent that there had been a failure to  comply  with
    the direction of the Tribunal to produce evidence  in  support  of  the
    allegation that the correct fee had not been processed and  the  reason
    why.  A direction had been made as a result of paragraph 34 of  Basnet.
    The billing data page nor the evidence to comply  with  that  direction
    was provided either before the First-tier Tribunal or now.

17. It is also clear from the decision in Basnet the question of who  bears
    the burden of proof is upon the Respondent for the reasons the Tribunal
    gave at paragraph 27.  In this appeal I am satisfied  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal reversed the burden of proof by requiring  the  Appellant
    to produce evidence in support  concerning  the  circumstances  of  the
    payment.  It was wrong to reverse the burden of proof and also  in  the
    circumstances when the Respondent had adduced no evidence whatsoever in
    respect of its allegation and had even failed to comply with a specific
    direction made by the Tribunal to produce such evidence.  In Basnet  at
    paragraph 30, the Tribunal was satisfied by the evidence before it that
    the Respondent had had funds in his  account  at  all  material  times.
    That has been supported by documentary evidence to  show  he  had  just
    short of �4,000 in that account.  It cannot be  said  however  that  he
    demonstrated  efficiency  in  the  timing  of  the  application.    The
    application being made on the date his leave expired.   No  reason  has
    been given as to why his application should be  made  at  such  a  late
    stage.  Nonetheless, having considered the evidence in relation to this
    particular case there is evidence which on the face of  it  is  to  the
    effect that there was no evidence to support why the fee had  not  been
    accepted the burden of  proof  remaining  on  the  Respondent  who  had
    produced no evidence of any kind.  Thus the Respondent  had  failed  to
    discharge the burden of proof not the Appellant.

18. In those circumstances, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set
    aside.  It is common ground between the parties that the judge erred in
    law by considering the Appellant had no right of appeal.   Consequently
    I set aside the decision and  find  the  Appellant  did  make  a  valid
    appeal.  As to the  remaking  of  the  decision  on  its  merits,  this
    requires an oral hearing given the seriousness of the  allegation  made
    of deception against this Appellant.  The Respondent should ensure that
    all documentation is available for the First-tier  Tribunal  to  decide
    this case on its merits including any document verification  report  in
    support of its assertion  that  the  Appellant  had  produced  a  false
    document and therefore  paragraph  322(1A)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    applied.  As this is a case where the merits of  the  application  have
    not been considered, both parties submit that it should be remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.  I agree and  find  that  this  appeal  is  in
    accordance with the  practice  statement  of  10th  February  2010  (as
    amended)  and  having  regard  to  the  overriding  objective  and  the
    deficient disposal of appeals, I direct that the decision  is  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal.  No findings of fact were reserved who will
    consider the appeal on its merits after hearing full argument.

Decision

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and  remitted  for
    the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  hearing  in  accordance  with  Section
    12(2)(b) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  and  practice
    statement of 10th February 2010 (as amended).
