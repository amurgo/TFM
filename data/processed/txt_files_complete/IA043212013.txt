                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Nigeria born 16 September  1988.   On  3
    October 2012 he applied for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant under the points-based  system.   The  application  was
    refused on 24 January 2013 on the basis  that  the  UKBA  had  obtained
    information that the appellant had been convicted of  travelling  on  a
    railway without paying a fare, on 23  June  2012,  and  therefore  that
    material facts had not been disclosed in relation to  his  application,
    which was refused under paragraph 322(1A) of HC 395.  Consideration was
    given to whether or not discretion should be exercised  in  his  favour
    and it was concluded that it would not be appropriate.  The application
    was refused and in  addition  a  direction  under  section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 was made.

2.   The  judge  accepted  the  Presenting  Officer's  submission  that  the
    honesty of the appellant in relation to the application of the Rule was
    irrelevant and that the key question was whether or not there had  been
    false  representations  made  or  material  facts  not  disclosed.   He
    concluded that it was clear that the appellant had been convicted of  a
    criminal offence and failed to disclose that in  the  application  form
    and indeed completed it in a manner which contained the assertion  that
    he had not been convicted of a criminal offence.  He noted that it  was
    accepted by the Presenting Officer that whilst she could not  guarantee
    the accuracy of her answer, it was more likely than  not  that  had  he
    disclosed this relatively minor criminal offence the application  would
    have been granted.   This  was  in  the  context  of  the  question  of
    discretion to  be  applied.   The  judge  however  considered  that  an
    important aspect of the Rule was to ensure that the Secretary of  State
    could rely upon full and accurate answers being provided in application
    forms which were presented to her and considered that there was no flaw
    in the approach taken by the  Secretary  of  State  in  not  exercising
    discretion in the appellant's favour in respect of the failing in  this
    case.

3.   As regards human rights, the judge noted that  there  was  no  imminent
    removal pending, in light of his allowing of the appeal as being not in
    accordance with the law to the extent that the direction under  section
    47 should not have been made, and he noted aspects of  the  appellant's
    private life including his relationship  with  his  fianc�e  which  was
    accepted as being a subsisting and loving relationship  and  that  they
    intended in due course to marry.  He noted  that  the  appellant  would
    have developed a private life not only with his fianc�e but  also  with
    friends since he had been in the country since September 2009 and  that
    these matters would require to be taken into account if  there  were  a
    decision to remove the appellant but as the judge  had  concluded  that
    the section 47 decision was not in accordance with the law that did not
    arise and therefore the appeal was dismissed on human rights grounds as
    well as under the Immigration Rules.

4.   The appellant sought and was granted permission to appeal against  this
    decision on the basis that the judge had arguably failed to  take  into
    account in particular the relevant authority  of  AA  (Nigeria)  [2010]
    EWCA Civ 773 which made it clear that a representation was "false"  for
    the purposes of paragraph 322(1A) only if it had been made dishonestly.
     Permission was granted on all grounds.

5.   Subsequently on 1 July 2013 the Secretary of State put  in  a  Rule  24
    response opposing the appeal and arguing that the  judge  had  directed
    himself appropriately.

6.   At the hearing Ms Horsley disagreed  with  the  response  and  conceded
    that there was an error of law on the honesty point.  This was a matter
    that should have been considered by the judge.  Subsequently,  although
    it is probably best to mention it at this point in  the  determination,
    Ms Horsley also sought and  was  granted  permission  to  withdraw  the
    section 47 decision in light of what had been  said  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Ahmadi [2013] EWCA Civ 512.

7.   Mr Okoro adopted and developed points made in his skeleton argument.

8.   The first issue was the question of misrepresentation  and  whether  it
    was innocent or dishonest.  The Presenting Officer at the  hearing  had
    not disputed the appellant's account when he had said what he had  been
    told by the ticket officer.  It was an innocent misrepresentation.   It
    was an offence which would not usually go before a  court  and  he  had
    offered to pay the balance but was told to pay when he got the  penalty
    letter.  He had not disputed the matter when he got the letter from the
    court and paid.  His behaviour had been credible.

9.   It was clear from AA that it was  necessary  to  show  the  element  of
    dishonesty.

10.  As regards the material facts point, this was the  main  point  in  the
    Home Office response.  To be material the facts should  have  a  direct
    effect on the decision.  It was relevant that  the  Home  Office  would
    have likely allowed the application if the offence had been  disclosed.
    It was a relatively minor offence.  The example in the  IDI  chapter  9
    section 4.9.1, set out in the skeleton, was a  useful  case  study  and
    relevant on the point.  It was also argued that the general grounds for
    refusal in the Immigration Rules provided ample scope  for  considering
    past criminality where the appropriate level of severity was  met,  and
    Mr Okoro referred to paragraph 322(5) of HC 395.

11.  With regard to human rights issues, a section 120 One-Stop Warning  had
    been served on the appellant and he had made a human rights  claim  and
    that should have been considered.

12.  In her submissions Ms Horsley argued that it should be found  that  the
    appellant knew he had been convicted of a criminal  offence  and  acted
    dishonestly in failing to disclose it.  He had pleaded guilty  by  post
    and had been told, as could be seen  from  section  6  of  the  judge's
    determination, that he had been told,  he  had  been  convicted  of  an
    offence.  The form he had had to fill in  about  personal  history  was
    very clear.  It was not reasonably likely that he had failed to realise
    he was convicted in a criminal court.  He had had the option  to  plead
    not guilty.  The notification in respect of this and the payment  of  a
    fine was a month before the application was made and it would have been
    fresh in his mind.  There was no discretion within the Rule.

13.  It was argued that the matter was material  to  the  application.   The
    appellant  had  signed  to  say  that  the  form   contained   truthful
    information.  The example given in Mr Okoro's skeleton concerning child
    benefit was a different scenario from that in the  instant  case  which
    involved a failure to disclose criminality.   The  Secretary  of  State
    expected to have disclosure.  There  was  an  element  of  trust.   The
    Tribunal was referred to the decision in FW [2011] EWCA  Civ  264.   At
    paragraph 21 there was a reference to the need to draw  inferences  and
    that could be done in this case from the fact that  the  appellant  had
    pleaded guilty by post and would have been aware of the effect of that.



14.  With regard to Mr Okoro's point concerning what had been  said  by  the
    Presenting Officer at the hearing, it should be noted from paragraph 13
    of the determination that the Presenting Officer had said what she said
    preceded by the caveat that she could not guarantee the accuracy of her
    answer.  It was not a concession.  She was not able  to  say  that  his
    application would have been granted.

15.  Paragraph 322(5) was not argued to be applicable.  The case fell  under
    paragraph 322(1A).  It was clear in the decision letter  why  that  was
    relied on.  The burden on the Secretary of State had been  met  by  the
    appellant failing to put the conviction on his form, and he  had  acted
    dishonestly.

16.  With regard to Article 8, if the Tribunal found  that  the  Immigration
    Rules decision was made out then this could not assist.   It  would  be
    proportionate to remove the appellant.   He  had  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom in a temporary capacity as a student since 2009  and  had  been
    engaged since 2011.  He could not succeed either under paragraph 276ADE
    or on the basis of Article 8 outside the Rules.  He could enjoy private
    life in another country.  He  could  also  study  in  another  country.
    There were certain categories where a breach of paragraph 322(1A) would
    not be taken into account and they included an application  to  join  a
    wife or a fianc�e.

17.  By way of reply Mr Okoro argued that Ms Horsley had not said  that  the
    offence met the appropriate severity test in terms of the IDIs  or  the
    threshold.  It was submitted that the  Presenting  Officer  before  the
    judge had rightly admitted that if the conviction  had  been  disclosed
    the application would likely have  been  allowed.   There  had  been  a
    failure to consider the impact of the refusal decision  on  his  future
    career and on his relationship.  His fianc�e was British  and  had  not
    been to Nigeria.  She had an inalienable right to enjoy her marriage in
    the United Kingdom and her human rights also had to be  considered  and
    it was necessary to consider the impact of the appellant's  removal  on
    her.

18.  There was no  point  in  the  determination  where  the  judge  or  the
    Presenting Officer doubted the appellant's account.   Paragraph  322(5)
    dealt  with  the  issue  of  previous  convictions,  such  matters   as
    character,  conduct  and  associations.   It  was   not   argued   that
    subparagraph (5) would replace subparagraph (1A), but the onus  was  on
    the Secretary of State to say why the particular ground was  relied  on
    and why the appellant would fall within subsection (5).  The Presenting
    Officer had failed to draw the appropriate distinction between the  two
    separate limbs of paragraph  322(1A)  i.e.  false  representations  and
    nondisclosure.   If  it  was  a  material  fact,   then   whether   the
    misrepresentation was innocent or  not,  it  was  immaterial.   It  was
    argued that it was not a material issue.

19.  I reserved my determination.

20.  There are, as was made clear in Mr Okoro's skeleton, three  issues  for
    determination.  The first two of these come under paragraph 322(1A)  of
    HC 395.  That states as follows:

         "Where false representations have been made or false  documents  or
         information have been submitted (whether or  not  material  to  the
         application, and whether or not to the applicant's  knowledge),  or
         material  facts  have  not  been  disclosed,  in  relation  to  the
         application, or in order to obtain documents from the Secretary  of
         State or a third party required in support of the application."

21.  This is a mandatory ground of refusal.  The refusal was  made  on  this
    basis because it was noted in the refusal letter  of  24  January  2013
    that at section 1 on the application form the appellant  declared  that
    he had no criminal  convictions  (including  traffic  offences),  civil
    judgments and/or charges made against him in the United Kingdom or  any
    other country.  Through routine checks made by the  UKBA  it  had  been
    discovered that he had not disclosed his conviction of travelling on  a
    railway without paying a fare, on 23 June 2012.

22.  It is clear that  there  are  two  alternative  bases  upon  which  the
    mandatory refusal may be made under paragraph 322(1A).   The  first  is
    where false representations have been made  and  the  second  is  where
    material facts have not been disclosed.  It is clear from the  decision
    of the Court of Appeal in AA, to which I have referred  above,  that  a
    representation is "false" for the purposes of paragraph 322(1A)  of  HC
    395 only if it has been made  dishonestly.   Ms  Horsley,  in  my  view
    entirely correctly, accepted that the judge had erred in regarding  the
    honesty of the appellant in relation to the application of the Rule  as
    irrelevant.  AA makes it clear that it is not just relevant but  it  is
    at the centre of the assessment that has to be made.

23.  Both parties were content for the appeal to proceed  on  the  basis  of
    the evidence that had already been given, and  accordingly  I  did  not
    hear from the appellant or from his fianc�e Priscilla Sarpong.

24.  In his witness statement of 5 February 2013  the  appellant  said  that
    the offence he committed was not one of non-payment of a train fare but
    not having the appropriate train ticket.  He  said  that  he  slept  on
    train transit and the train took him to Dartford instead of  Rochester.
    He had tried to explain to the  railway  officer  but  he  insisted  he
    should be booked although he had offered to  pay  for  the  outstanding
    fare.  He says that the officer told him not to worry that  the  matter
    would not be taken to the court and if he admitted liability  he  would
    only get a fine and it would end the matter but if he denied  liability
    he could be charged to the court and get a bigger fine but it would not
    affect his criminal record.  He thought that this was the truth  so  he
    believed the officer and admitted liability.  He said that he  did  not
    know that they would take the matter to court.  He  pleaded  guilty  by
    post and paid the fine.  I note from the oral evidence of the appellant
    as recorded by the judge, that after he  pleaded  guilty  by  post  the
    court sent him a notice  dated  3  September  2012  that  he  had  been
    convicted of an offence of travelling on the railway without  paying  a
    fare and was liable to a fine and costs, which he paid.  Although it is
    obviously hearsay, it is relevant to note that his fianc�e confirms his
    account of what he said happened to him, in her statement of 5 February
    2012.

25.  As was said by the Court of Appeal in FW,  to  which  I  have  referred
    above, at paragraph 21, it can often be difficult to decide  whether  a
    person has acted dishonestly, because they will usually  protest  their
    innocence, leaving the Tribunal of fact to draw inferences  from  other
    evidence.  In that case it was  noted  that  the  conviction  was  very
    recent and the appellant had been directed by the notes in the form  to
    a source of information that would have made it clear that it  was  not
    spent.  In the appeal before me, Ms Horsley made  the  point  that  the
    appellant had pleaded guilty by post and had been aware of  the  effect
    of that.  The notification about the payment of the fine came  a  month
    before the application was made and it would have  been  fresh  in  his
    mind.  For the appellant Mr Okoro has argued that he conducted  himself
    credibly all along, having admitted to the  offence  on  the  spot  and
    offered to pay the balance, pleaded guilty and paid the  fine  and  his
    account throughout was consistent.  He also makes the  point  that  the
    Presenting  Officer  did  not  cross-examine  the  appellant   on   the
    statement.    In   the   circumstances   it   is   argued   that    the
    misrepresentation was an honest one.

26.  Two particular matters seem to me to be  key  in  this  aspect  of  the
    appeal.  The first is that, as  I  have  referred  to  as  set  out  at
    paragraph 6 of the determination the appellant in oral evidence to  the
    judge said that he was sent notice on 3 September 2012 that he had been
    convicted of  an  offence.   This  was  a  month  before  he  made  the
    application for leave to remain.   Whatever  he  may  have  thought  or
    understood by what was said by the train official and  indeed  whatever
    may have been  said  by  that  official,  the  fact  remains  that  the
    appellant received a notice making it clear to him  that  he  had  been
    convicted of an offence.  Tier  4  (General)  application  form  at  I1
    specifically asks: "Have you ever been convicted of a criminal  offence
    either in the UK or in another country?".  In the light of the specific
    question asked and the specific information given to  the  appellant  a
    month previously, I consider that the necessary element  of  dishonesty
    has been shown in this case.  He is clearly an intelligent and educated
    man, and must have been aware that he had been convicted of a  criminal
    offence and chose not to mention that in the application form.  I think
    this is the only reasonable  inference  that  can  be  drawn  from  the
    circumstances, and accordingly I consider that the Secretary  of  State
    properly concluded that false representations had  been  made  in  this
    case.

27.  In the alternative is the question of whether material facts  have  not
    been disclosed.  On behalf of the appellant Mr Okoro  argued  that  the
    facts were not material in this case since the Presenting  Officer  had
    admitted that if the relatively minor offence had  been  disclosed  the
    application would more likely than not have been  allowed,  citing  the
    example of a person who has applied for indefinite leave to remain as a
    spouse and not declaring that they are in  receipt  of  child  benefit.
    Another example given is  that  of  spent  convictions  which  are  not
    required to be disclosed under  the  Rehabilitation  of  Offenders  Act
    because they would be immaterial in determining the applicant's current
    application.  It is also argued that the general  grounds  for  refusal
    provide  ample  scope  for  considering  past  criminality,  citing  in
    particular paragraph 322(5) which is a discretionary ground for refusal
    concerned with the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to
    remain in the United Kingdom in the light of their  character,  conduct
    or associations or the fact that they represent a  threat  to  national
    security.

28.  It is however I think, a matter for the Secretary of State whether  she
    decides that the conduct in question falls within one  particular  Rule
    or another and it is then for her to substantiate it.  It  is  relevant
    to note, as Ms Horsley reminded me,  that  the  Presenting  Officer  as
    recorded at paragraph 13 of the determination accepted that  while  she
    could not guarantee the accuracy of her answer it was more likely  than
    not that disclosure  of  the  offence  would  not  have  precluded  the
    application being granted.  This was in no  sense  a  concession  or  a
    guarantee.  It is also relevant to  note  that  the  Tier  4  (General)
    application form at section I refers in the  head  note  "any  criminal
    convictions  you  have"  and  the  specific  question  asked  does  not
    distinguish between different types of criminal offence but simply asks
    if the person has ever been convicted of a criminal offence.   In  this
    regard I see force to the point made by the judge at  paragraph  13  of
    his determination where he said: "The integrity of the  system  depends
    upon those who seek entitlements from it participating in  the  process
    in a way which  provides  the  respondent  with  the  fullest  possible
    information and Rule 322(1A)  is  part  of  the  means  to  that  end."
    Whatever the view that was expressed in any event in far from  absolute
    terms by the Presenting Officer at the hearing, that could in no  sense
    bind the Secretary of State, and the decision had already been taken to
    refuse the application in relation to this aspect of the Rule.   As  Ms
    Horsley said, the remarks of the Presenting Officer cannot be taken  to
    be a concession of any kind.  I consider that it has  been  shown  that
    material facts were not disclosed  in  this  case  in  the  failure  to
    disclose the conviction, and accordingly paragraph 322(1A) was properly
    applied in this regard also.  The appeal is therefore  dismissed  under
    the Immigration Rules.

29.  As regards Article 8, it is the case that the  appellant  has  been  in
    the United Kingdom since  September  2009,  having  completed  a  first
    degree in 2012 and being, at least at the time when the  statement  was
    signed on 5 February 2013, engaged on a  Masters  course  at  Cranfield
    University.  Quite apart from the time  he  has  spent  in  the  United
    Kingdom, the studies he has undertaken and the friendships he has made,
    he is also engaged to Ms Sarpong having been engaged since 2011 and  he
    says in his statement they are only waiting to register  and  celebrate
    their marriage when he completes his  Masters  degree.   He  makes  the
    point that she is British  born  and  brought  up.   This  is  a  point
    repeated in Ms Sarpong's statement.  She says that if he is removed  it
    would frustrate their marriage plans and it would neither be reasonable
    nor proportionate to ask her to follow him to Nigeria so  as  to  marry
    him because she was born and brought up in the United Kingdom.

30.  The judge accepted that the appellant was in a  subsisting  and  loving
    relationship with Ms Sarpong and that they intended in  due  course  to
    marry.  He erred in dismissing the appeal in this regard on  the  basis
    that no valid removal decision had been made.   It  may  well  be  that
    matters in respect of Article 8 would need to be addressed at the  time
    when a removal decision has been made, but that does  not  preclude  an
    obligation to assess it as of now.  As so often with  Article  8  cases
    the question comes down to one of proportionality.  I accept  that  the
    appellant  has  a  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom,   and   his
    relationship with Ms Sarpong can either be regarded as  falling  within
    that or as part of his family life.  I  think  it  is  probably  better
    regarded as private life since they are engaged rather than married and
    I have not been told that they live together.  Clearly the  appellant's
    removal would be an interference with that private life.  Equally  that
    would be in accordance with the law.  The question is  whether  it  has
    been shown that the interference would be proportionate.   On  the  one
    hand there would be the disruption to the appellant's private life,  in
    particular his relationship with Ms Sarpong and his  studies.   On  the
    other side of the line is the importance of  maintaining  an  effective
    system of immigration control, and in the context where  I  have  found
    that both elements of paragraph 322(1A) are applicable  in  this  case.
    It is not as though the appellant would necessarily be prevented for  a
    significant period of  time  from  returning  to  the  United  Kingdom,
    bearing in mind the provisions of paragraph A320 of HC 395.  Bearing in
    mind these matters and the interests  of  both  the  appellant  and  Ms
    Sarpong,  I  have   concluded   that   his   removal   would   not   be
    disproportionate.  In this case I consider the interests of immigration
    control outweigh his private and family  life  interests.   Accordingly
    the appeal is dismissed under Article 8 also.

Upper Tribunal Judge Allen
