Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In Person


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 7th June 1981.

 2. On 11th August 2015  the  respondent  refused  his  application  for  a
    residence card under Regulation 8(5) of the  2006  Regulations  on  the
    grounds  that  she  was  not  satisfied  that  he  was  in  a   durable
    relationship with the sponsor.

 3. The judge, in a determination promulgated on 23rd October  2015,  found
    that the couple were, as claimed, in a durable  relationship  and  that
    the requirements of Regulation 8(5) were  met.   He  then  allowed  the
    appeal under the EEA Regulations.

 4. The Secretary of State did  not  challenge  the  judge's  findings  but
    sought  permission  to  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law by allowing the claimant's appeal outright.

Findings and Conclusions

 5. The Secretary of State is correct.  She has not had the opportunity  to
    exercise her discretion in this case under Regulation 17(4) of the 2006
    EEA Regulations.  The correct course was for the judge  to  have  found
    that the claimant met the requirements of Regulation 8(5) and  to  have
    remitted the case to the Secretary of  State  for  consideration  under
    Regulation 17(4).

 6. In Ihemedu (OFMs- meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00340 (IAC) the Tribunal
    held:

         "Regulation 17(4) makes  the  issue  of  a  residence  card  to  an
         OFM/extended family member  a  matter  of  discretion.   Where  the
         Secretary of State has not yet exercised that discretion  the  most
         an Immigration Judge is entitled to do is to allow  the  appeal  as
         not being in accordance with the law leaving the matter of  whether
         to exercise this discretion in the appellant's favour or not to the
         Secretary of State."

Notice of Decision

 7. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside.  It is re-
    made as follows.  The appeal is allowed on the basis that the  decision
    was not in accordance with the law and remitted  to  the  Secretary  of
    State for further consideration under Regulation 17(4).
