For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Jessica  Pacey  sitting  at  Sheldon  Court,
    Birmingham on 30  June  2014)  dismissing  their  appeals  against  the
    decision by an Entry Clearance Officer (Dhaka) to refuse to grant  them
    entry clearance as family visitors.  The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
    make an anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the  appellants
    should be  accorded  anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The first appellant is the mother of the second and  third  appellants,
    who are children under the age of 18.  As the first  appellant  is  the
    main appellant in this appeal, I shall hereafter refer to her simply as
    the appellant save where the context otherwise requires.

 3. The appellants are all nationals of Bangladesh.  On  10  July  2013  an
    Entry Clearance Officer in Dhaka (post reference Dhaka\639602) gave his
    reasons for refusing the appellant's application for entry clearance to
    visit the United Kingdom for a period of two weeks.  The children  were
    refused leave in line with their mother.  Whilst he  acknowledged  that
    her proposed trip to the UK was to be sponsored by another  party  (her
    brother in the  UK),  it  was  reasonable  to  take  into  account  her
    personal, social and economic circumstances in Bangladesh  as  part  of
    his overall assessment of her  application.   She  said  she  had  been
    employed part-time since 1  July  2012  with  Akota  Department  Store,
    earning BDT30,000 per month.  There  was  evidence  of  these  payments
    going into her bank account, but he noted that during a telephone  call
    to her UK sponsor, he stated  that  this  business  was  owned  by  her
    husband.  She had not shown any evidence of his business and  financial
    circumstances to satisfy him that Akota Department Store  did  in  fact
    employ her, and that the funds in her bank account originated from that
    business.   He  further  noted  that  her  own  bank  statement  showed
    transactions that could only be reconciled to her claimed  income  from
    February 2013, and not from July 2012 when she stated she  started  her
    employment.  He therefore had to question if these  deposits  had  been
    made solely to support the application.  Without any further  evidence,
    he was not satisfied that her income was as  stated  or  that  she  was
    employed as claimed.

 4. In the light of the above, he  was  not  satisfied  she  was  genuinely
    seeking entry as a visitor for a limited period as stated by  her,  not
    exceeding six months, or that she intended to leave the United  Kingdom
    at the end of the period of the visit as stated by her.

 5. The Entry Clearance Officer was also not satisfied that  the  appellant
    would maintain and accommodate herself and  any  dependants  adequately
    out of resources available to her without recourse to public  funds  or
    taking  employment,  or  that  she  would,  with  any  dependants,   be
    maintained and accommodated adequately by relatives or friends.  He was
    further not satisfied that she could meet the costs of  the  return  or
    onward journey.

 6. His reasoning  was  that  during  a  telephone  conversation  with  the
    sponsor, he stated that he supported his wife and two children  on  his
    wage as a chef with a restaurant.  He noted  from  the  submitted  bank
    statements in the sponsor's name that he was reliant on public funds to
    bolster his income each week.  Given his responsibilities in supporting
    a family of four on a low wage, funding a visit by  the  appellant  and
    her two children  would  impose  a  considerable  additional  financial
    burden upon him.  He was not satisfied this increased financial  outlay
    was commensurate with his current economic circumstances, and that such
    funds would actually be available to her in the United Kingdom.

The Grounds of Appeal

 7. In the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, it was argued that
    the decisions were unreasonable, unjustified and against the weight  of
    the evidence.

The Entry Clearance Manager's Review

 8. On 8 May  2014  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  gave  his  reasons  for
    upholding the refusal decision.  The appellant stated that the  sponsor
    would cover all the costs associated with her visit.  But he noted that
    the   sponsor's   declaration,   while   covering    maintenance    and
    accommodation, stated  that  the  travel  costs  would  be  covered  if
    required.  He was not satisfied  the  concerns  of  the  ECO  had  been
    adequately addressed in the grounds of appeal.

 9. As to the appellant's circumstances, the only evidence provided by  the
    husband was a parental consent letter.  The concerns as to  the  origin
    of the  deposits  into  the  appellant's  bank  account  had  not  been
    adequately addressed.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

10. At the hearing before Judge Pacey, the sponsor gave oral evidence.   In
    her subsequent decision,  Judge  Pacey  summarised  the  case  for  the
    appellants in paragraph 9.  They would leave the UK at the end of their
    visit since their husband/father was in Bangladesh,  and  the  children
    were in full-time education.  Evidence of the appellant's earnings  had
    been provided, and the sponsor  was  in  a  position  to  maintain  and
    accommodate the appellants during their two week stay as  he  had  over
    ï¿½5,000 in savings.

11. The judge went on to dismiss the appeal for the  reasons  she  gave  in
    paragraphs [12] to [17].  In paragraph [12], she said: "Some  documents
    have been provided of her husband's business, but these were not in  my
    view adequate to demonstrate that it generated an income sufficient  to
    support the appellants".

12. In paragraph [13], the judge observed that the children  were  aged  10
    and 13 and hence, in her view, were young enough to engage with the  UK
    education system.  In paragraph [14], she  held  that  the  appellant's
    savings were not a sufficient incentive for her to return to Bangladesh
    since savings could be accessed from abroad or could be transferred  to
    a UK financial institution.

13. In paragraphs [15] and [16], she found that the  costs  of  maintaining
    the appellants would not be too great  for  someone  in  the  sponsor's
    financial position to bear.  However,  although  the  sponsor  said  he
    would pay for the appellants' flights, he said at the hearing  that  he
    had no idea how much they would cost:

         Flights for three people from and to  Pakistan  would  not,  it  is
         reasonable to suppose, be cheap and I do not find it credible  that
         if he had agreed to pay the air fares the sponsor would not wish to
         ascertain how much it would cost him, both  to  assess  whether  he
         could afford it and whether he would be able to withdraw sufficient
         money from savings at the appropriate time.

14. In paragraph [17], the judge said that, on the balance of probabilities
    and on the totality of the evidence before  her,  she  therefore  found
    that the appellants had not discharged the burden of proof.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

15. The appellant applied for permission to appeal, raising three  grounds.
    Ground 1 was that the judge had failed to  give  adequate  reasons  for
    finding at paragraph [12] that the documents relating to her  husband's
    business did not adequately demonstrate that the business generated  an
    income sufficient to support the appellants.

16. Ground 2 was that the same finding was perverse/irrational  because  of
    the documentary evidence made  available  at  the  First-tier  hearing,
    which the representatives went on to list.

17. The judge had also been perverse in her line of reasoning in  paragraph
    [16].  It was unreasonable for her to make a negative assessment of the
    sponsor's  credibility  on  the  sole   basis   that   he   could   not
    instantaneously quote air ticket costs at the hearing, particularly  as
    he was a lay person who had no  specialist  knowledge  of  the  airline
    industry.  Also, the sponsor at all times has held the majority of  his
    savings in  his  current  account,  which  meant  that  he  could  have
    withdrawn his savings as and when required.  Further, the costs of  the
    appellants' return journey would clearly have been affordable  for  the
    sponsor given that he had savings in excess of ï¿½5,000.

18. Ground 3 was that the judge had  misdirected  herself  in  law  in  her
    finding at paragraph  [13]  that  the  children  would  not  return  to
    Bangladesh because they  were  young  enough  to  engage  with  the  UK
    educational system.   This  was  an  assumption  based  on  doubts  and
    suspicion, instead of on evidence.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

19. On 20 August 2014 Judge McWilliam granted permission to appeal for  the
    following reasons:

         There is some merit in the grounds.  It is arguable that the  judge
         applied a too high  standard  of  proof,  despite  having  properly
         directed herself at [3], particularly in  relation  to  the  income
         generated from the appellant's husband's business.

The Rule 24 Response

20. On 27 August 2014 Mr John Parkinson  of  the  Specialist  Appeals  Team
    settled a Rule 24 response opposing the appeal.



The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

21. At the hearing before me, I reviewed the documents that were  available
    to the First-tier Tribunal pertaining to the  husband's  business.   Mr
    Mustafa accepted that they did not show the turnover of  the  business,
    or how much profit (if any) the business generated.  On behalf  of  the
    Entry Clearance  Officer,  Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  the  documents
    disclosed no causal link between the cash deposits into the appellant's
    bank account (which were not in any event  regular,  monthly  deposits)
    with employment in the husband's business.  In reply, Mr  Mustafa  said
    this did not matter, as the judge had simply not given adequate reasons
    for finding against the appellants.  Also,  the  judge's  approach  was
    erroneous in law having regard to the following observation in Ogunkola
    v ECO Lagos [2002] UKIAT 02238 where the Tribunal held as follows:

         If lack of economic incentive to return to the  country  of  origin
         were sufficient to found a refusal of a visit application, then  no
         person living overseas whose standard of living was lower than that
         prevailing in the United Kingdom could ever come on  holiday  here,
         or visit relatives settled here.  That is not the law.

Discussion

22. The refusal was squarely based on the proposition that  the  origin  of
    the deposits  into  the  appellant's  bank  account  was  not  credibly
    demonstrated, with the consequence that the Entry Clearance Officer was
    not satisfied that her income was as stated or that she was employed as
    claimed.  This was reasonably relied on by the Entry Clearance  Officer
    as calling into question whether the appellant was a genuine visitor.

23. Although the Entry Clearance Manager  reiterated  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's concern on this issue, questioning whether the deposits  into
    the appellant's bank account may have been made purely to  support  the
    submission of the visa applications, the documentation provided for the
    appeal hearing did not go any way towards filling the evidential void.

24. While the documents listed in ground 2  disclosed  further  information
    about the husband's business, they did not show that the appellant  was
    employed by the husband in the business, or that she was  receiving  an
    income from such employment.  Apart from the fact that  they  indicated
    that the business was trading, they said nothing  about  the  financial
    circumstances of the business, which the Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
    expressly  put  in  issue  in  the  refusal   decision.    Hence,   the
    documentation  did  not  show  that  the  business   generated   income
    sufficient to support the appellants.  In the course of oral  argument,
    Mr Mustafa conceded this, and so one limb of ground 2 falls  away.   It
    was not perverse or irrational for the judge to find that the documents
    were not adequate to demonstrate that the business generated an  income
    sufficient to support the appellants.

25. Mr Mustafa's subsidiary argument is that this finding is irrelevant, as
    there is no requirement for the appellants to be well settled in  their
    home country, and a lack of economic incentive to return to the country
    of  origin  is  insufficient  to  found  a  refusal  of  a  visit  visa
    application.  But it was not the appellant's economic circumstances per
    se that triggered the refusal  under  subparagraphs  (i)  and  (ii)  of
    paragraph 41.  It was the asserted  unreliability  of  the  appellant's
    account of her economic circumstances which reasonably  led  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and Entry Clearance Manager to question  whether  the
    appellant was a genuine visitor.  The burden of proof rested  with  the
    appellant on appeal to bring forward  evidence  which  addressed  their
    concerns, and it was open to the judge to  find  that  the  documentary
    evidence provided in the appellant's bundle  was  inadequate  for  this
    purpose.

26. I return to ground 1, which is that the judge failed to  give  adequate
    reasons for her finding at paragraph  [12].   I  consider  the  judge's
    reasoning was adequate in the context of the central  issue  which  had
    been raised in the refusal decision, and  also  addressed  in  the  ECM
    review.  Moreover, the complaint in ground 1  is  not  that  the  judge
    failed to give adequate reasons for explaining the implications of  her
    finding at paragraph [12], but simply that she failed to give  adequate
    reasons for the  finding  itself.   But  this  does  not  stand  up  to
    scrutiny.  The finding is that it  is  not  shown  that  the  husband's
    business generates an income sufficient to support the appellants.  The
    reasoning is that  the  documents  relating  to  his  business  do  not
    adequately demonstrate this.  This is a good enough reason, and  it  is
    not disputed.

27. A separate point is raised in ground 2 in respect  of  paragraph  [16].
    The burden rested with the appellant to show, among other things,  that
    at the date of decision she could meet the cost of the return or onward
    journey.  As the appellant could not fund the trip herself (or had  not
    proved that she could do so), the extant question  for  the  judge  was
    whether at the date of the refusal decision the sponsor was  both  able
    and willing to pay for  return  air  tickets  for  the  three  proposed
    visitors, as well as incurring the much more modest cost (as  found  by
    the judge) of maintaining and accommodating them in his  household  for
    two weeks.  The fact that the sponsor had savings in excess  of  ï¿½5,000
    did not in itself establish that  at  the  date  of  the  decision  the
    sponsor was willing to spend a substantial proportion of this money  on
    the appellants' air travel to and from Bangladesh.  The fact  that  the
    sponsor  had  not  applied  his  mind  to  the  costs  of  funding  the
    appellants' air travel was not consistent with the proposition that  at
    the time of the refusal decision he was willing to spend a  substantial
    part of his savings on the appellants' air travel.  It was open to  the
    judge to draw an adverse inference from the fact that the  sponsor  had
    not applied his mind to  the  costs  of  funding  the  appellants'  air
    travel, and thus to find that subparagraph (vii) of  paragraph  41  was
    not satisfied.

28. Turning to ground 3, the judge's finding at paragraph  [13]  also  does
    not disclose an error  of  law.   In  paragraph  [13],  the  judge  was
    addressing one of the arguments advanced at the hearing by  Mr  Mustafa
    which was that the appellants had an adequate incentive  to  return  to
    Bangladesh on completion of a short two week visit, as the two children
    were in full-time education.  It was open to the judge to  reject  that
    consideration as carrying significant weight on the ground that the two
    children were young enough to  engage  with  the  UK  education  system
    instead.  In short, the judge was saying that the pull  factor  of  the
    children returning to  their  full-time  education  in  Bangladesh  was
    counterbalanced by the pull factor of  the  children  continuing  their
    full-time education in the UK.  The point would have been  stronger  if
    the judge had added that the free education which would be available to
    the children in the United Kingdom was probably superior  to  the  free
    education,  if  any,  that  was  available  to  them   in   Bangladesh.
    Nonetheless, the pull factor of free education in the UK is,  like  the
    pull factor of free treatment on the NHS, a recognised phenomenon;  and
    as a decision maker in a specialist Tribunal, the judge was entitled to
    take judicial notice of it.

29. Even if I am wrong about that, the other reasons advanced by the  judge
    for dismissing  the  appeal  are  sufficient  to  sustain  the  adverse
    decision.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
