Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms M Atcha, Solicitor, of Ebrahim & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appeals of these three appellants were originally  linked  to  that
    of their mother (appeal number IA/30245/2013).  The four  appeals  were
    dismissed in 2013.  Following a hearing on  11  February  2014  it  was
    agreed that the decision dismissing the appeals was  to  be  set  aside
    following a material error of law.  The error of law  decision  that  I
    produced following this hearing is as follows.

         1.   By coincidence these were appeal in which I granted permission
             to appeal.  This was in the following terms:


               i. The appellant, a citizen of India, was refused leave under
                  the domestic violence rules on 3.7.2013,  and  her  appeal
                  against removal was dismissed by Judge of  the  First-tier
                  Tribunal Mitchell  (promulgated on 12.12.2013).  The other
                  three appellants were refused entry clearance to settle in
                  the UK with their mother.  These refusals were  all  dated
                  July 2012.  Their appeals were linked  to  that  of  their
                  mother.


              ii. The grounds, which were in time, complain that  the  judge
                  erred in:  (1) his  approach  to  the  evidence  that  the
                  appellant suffered domestic violence at the hands  of  her
                  husband,  and  that  she  had  found  this  difficult   to
                  disclose; (2) his approach to the  issue  of  whether  the
                  marriage had been genuine, before  the  violence,  and  to
                  whether the appellant and  her  husband  had  been  living
                  together.


             iii. The grounds are poorly drafted  and  lack  focus.   Having
                  said that,  however,  the  determination  is  surprisingly
                  brief given the issues involved (under 4 pages), and I  am
                  left with a concern that  the  determination  as  a  whole
                  would not leave an observer with the impression  that  the
                  appellants had received a full and fair hearing  of  their
                  appeals.


              iv. The judge makes no reference to the possibility  that  the
                  appellant  may  have  been  lacking   in   confidence   or
                  vulnerable in any way, and it appears to me to be arguable
                  that a failure to even consider this possibility may  have
                  undermined the adverse credibility findings  at  para  30.
                  In domestic violence cases it will often be the case  that
                  injuries are ascribed to accidents, as here with the wrist
                  injury in 2011.  In dealing  with  such  an  issue  it  is
                  arguable that the judge was obliged to conduct the hearing
                  in such a way as  to  obtain  the  best  evidence  from  a
                  vulnerable witness, and to  consider  the  possibility  of
                  such vulnerability in assessing credibility.


         2.   It is  arguable  that  the  findings  as  to  the  appellant's
             husband's relationship history in the 2010 determination  were
             not considered.  The  consideration  of  the  appeals  by  the
             appellant's children was very brief, and did not  include  any
             consideration  of  their  best  interests.   Overall   further
             consideration is needed of the issue  of  whether  there  were
             legal errors in the approach taken to the evidence, and to the
             conduct of the hearing, by the judge; and whether the findings
             are supported by adequate reasoning.


         3.   Although it did not emerge clearly from the grounds  the  main
             submission made at the error of law hearing concerned  whether
             the judge had  erred  in  dealing  with  the  appeals  of  the
             children, without informing the parties that he would be doing
             so.  The appellant had been told that  the  domestic  violence
             appeal would be heard first,  and  that  the  entry  clearance
             appeals of the children would be heard only after the  outcome
             of that appeal was clear.


         4.   In connection with this  point  I  examined  the  file.   This
             confirmed that there had been  directions,  when  the  appeals
             were linked, indicating that the entry clearance appeals would
             not be determined until after that  of  the  first  appellant.
             The record of proceedings confirmed that  there  had  been  no
             submissions made by either side about the children's  appeals,
             which  suggested  that  the  parties  at  the   hearing   were
             proceeding on this basis.  As  a  consequence  it  was  agreed
             between the parties that there had been a  material  error  of
             law.  There was clear unfairness  to  the  appellants  in  the
             appeals of the children being  dismissed  when  neither  party
             were aware that they were to be determined. There  were  other
             issues, as reflected in  the  grant  of  permission,  but  the
             agreement between the parties meant that it was not  necessary
             to consider these further.  The parties agreed,  in  addition,
             that what was required was a rehearing of the appeals, with no
             findings preserved.


         5.   Following the agreement of the parties I therefore  find  that
             there was a material error of law in the judge's decision, and
             I set it aside.  The parties agreed that the matter should  be
             listed to be remade in the Upper Tribunal.  This  appeared  to
             me to be sensible, in view of the current  shorter  delays  in
             listing, the potential vulnerability of the  first  appellant,
             and the interests of the children.

2.   Following this error of law decision I heard the  appellants'  mother's
    appeal at Field House on 13 March  2014.   I  went  on  to  remake  the
    decision by allowing her appeal under the Immigration Rules.  This  was
    on  the  basis  that  I  accepted  that  the  appellants'  mother   had
    established that her marriage was caused to permanently break down as a
    result of domestic violence.  She therefore came within  the  terms  of
    paragraph 289A of the Immigration Rules, and was entitled to settlement
    in the UK despite the fact that her marriage to a British  citizen  had
    broken down in this way.

3.   At the start of the remaking hearing for these three  appellants  there
    was a discussion with the representatives about the  points  at  issue.
    It was agreed that all of the appellants had been minors at the date of
    application.  By the date of decision the first  appellant  had  turned
    18, but it was agreed that the relevant date for consideration  of  her
    age was the date of application, when she had been 17.  Because of  the
    delays in the appeal process, and the passage of time,  the  appellants
    are now aged 20, 18, and 15.

4.   The applications were made on 4 April 2012.  The  application  for  the
    first appellant was refused on 5 July 2012, and those for the other two
    appellants on 17 July 2012.  The decisions were reviewed  on  18  March
    2013.

5.   It was further agreed that I was concerned, in remaking the  decisions,
    with the circumstances as they were in July 2012,  when  the  decisions
    were taken.  The grounds of refusal were whether the appellants' mother
    (the sponsor) had sole responsibility  for  the  appellants  (paragraph
    301(i)(b) of the Immigration Rules); and whether the  appellants  would
    have been adequately maintained and accommodated (paragraph 301(vi) and
    (via)).  Although these were the two  grounds  of  refusal  there  were
    matters raised in the refusals that could be regarded  as  sub  issues.
    The first of these was whether the sponsor and  her  husband  had  been
    living together in the UK at the date of decision.  The second was  the
    status  of  Indian  court  guardianship  papers.   This  related  to  a
    guardianship order obtained by  the  sponsor  from  the  Court  of  the
    Additional District Judge, Bharuch, dated 8 March 2010.

6.   There was some discussion as to the impact of the passage of time.   It
    was agreed that my decisions could only  be  focussed  on  whether  the
    refusals in  July  2012  were  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the
    Immigration Rules.  It would be necessary, if the appeals were allowed,
    for the respondent to consider the current position, but it was  agreed
    that I would do no more than refer in brief terms, in this eventuality,
    to the various additional documents that had been  provided  about  the
    sponsor's current circumstances, and her current ability  to  meet  the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements.

7.   The sponsor gave evidence at the hearing,  and  was  cross-examined  at
    length.  The sponsor has been in the UK since March 2011, and  has  not
    seen the appellants since that date.   The  questioning  was  concerned
    with the nature of her financial and other support for them; where  she
    was living at the  date  of  decision;  the  extent  of  her  telephone
    contact; her financial circumstances; why her husband was  not  on  the
    electoral register at the address; the contact,  if  any,  between  the
    appellants  and  their  father;  the  reason  for  the  timing  of  the
    applications; their educational history and interests; and  with  their
    activities outside school.

Decision and Reasons

8.   I have decided to  remake  the  appeals  by  allowing  them  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The concerns raised in the three  refusal  notices,
    and in the review document, have been adequately addressed.

9.   The first  ground  of  refusal  related  to  sole  responsibility.   Mr
    Melvin, for the respondent, submitted that the court was not being told
    the truth about the sponsor's first husband.  On  balance  it  had  not
    been shown that there had been no contact from 2006 onwards.   On  this
    issue it appears to me that the matters raised in the refusals, and  at
    the hearing, cannot be said to amount to more than suspicions,  without
    evidential grounding.  In the 2010 appeal, where the  sponsor's  appeal
    against the refusal of her spouse visa  was  allowed,  the  2010  court
    guardianship document was accepted.  There is nothing on  the  face  of
    the document that appears to  be  suspicious.   No  evidence  has  been
    provided by the respondent to show that the document is false.  It  was
    accepted by Mr Melvin, at the hearing before me, that any assertion  by
    the Entry Clearance Officer was not evidenced, and that the burden  was
    on the respondent in this regard.  The guardianship document  indicates
    that the  appellants'  father  abandoned  any  responsibility  for  the
    children in 2010, but nothing in that document is inconsistent with the
    sponsor's evidence that his involvement ended  when  he  abandoned  the
    family before the divorce in 2006.  There is nothing in the evidence to
    indicate that the appellants' father was involved in their lives in any
    way after 2006.  Evidence has been  provided  to  establish  that  they
    lived with  their  grandmother  until  her  death  in  July  2011,  and
    subsequently continued to live with their aunt.  Before  travelling  to
    the UK in 2011 their mother obtained the guardianship  document.    The
    suggestion that their father remained involved can only be regarded  as
    speculative.  There is no evidence to support this position.

10.  I therefore find that  the  appellants'  evidence  does  establish,  on
    balance of probabilities, that the appellants' father had not  had  any
    involvement in their lives since 2006.

11.  The evidence  that  the  sponsor  had  continued  to  provide  for  the
    appellants financially, and make all  relevant  decisions  about  their
    lives, was reasonably comprehensive.  It was accepted  that  there  was
    evidence of money transfers.  Mr Melvin also accepted that the evidence
    established  that  the  sponsor  was  engaged   with   her   children's
    activities.  The only contrary indications were doubts over  the  costs
    of the  sponsor's  frequent  claimed  telephone  calls  to  India,  and
    limitations  in  her  answers  in  cross-examination.   These  matters,
    however, do not appear to me to be  ones  that  could  be  regarded  as
    capable of justifying a conclusion that the sponsor had  not  had  sole
    responsibility for the appellants from  2006  onwards.   At  most  they
    could be regarded as raising some  doubts  in  relation  to  peripheral
    considerations.   Nothing  in  the  refusals,  the   review,   or   the
    submissions cast doubt on the core evidence, all of  which  pointed  to
    the sponsor having maintained  sole  parental  responsibility,  despite
    having been separated from the appellants for so many years.

12.  For these reasons I find that it has been established that the  sponsor
    has had sole responsibility for the three appellants from 2006 onwards.
     It has not been suggested that the involvement of their  aunt  amounts
    to shared responsibility.

13.  The position in relation to maintenance and  accommodation  appears  to
    me to be similar.  A concern was raised by the Entry Clearance  Officer
    that there were people sharing the same name as the appellants'  father
    living in a street in  Bolton.   As  was  acknowledged  by  Mr  Melvin,
    however, the names were similar but not identical,  and  there  was  no
    evidence that the appellants' father had been living in the UK  at  the
    date of decision, or at any time.  As was  acknowledged  this  can,  at
    most, be regarded as a matter that might lead to a suspicion justifying
    further investigation, but it cannot be regarded as more than that.

14.  The evidential basis for the assertion in the refusal that the  sponsor
    and her husband were not living together at the date  of  decision  was
    the electoral register.  The sponsor, however, has provided a number of
    documents to show that the couple were living together at this  address
    at the relevant date, including  council  tax  documents,  and  utility
    bills.  The fact that a person may not be on the electoral register for
    a particular address is not conclusive evidence that that person is not
    living at that address.  It may be that a person  is  registered  at  a
    different address,  or  not  registered  at  all.   The  various  other
    documents point to the same conclusion that I reached in  deciding  the
    sponsor's appeal, namely that the couple had been  living  together  at
    this time, and it does not appear to me that  any  solid  reasons  have
    been put forward for rejecting that evidence.

15.  It was suggested that the lack of a written tenancy agreement  or  rent
    book should be regarded as significant.  It is the case, however,  that
    many  people  rent  property  without  such  written  agreements.    An
    independent report on the accommodation  was  provided  for  the  entry
    clearance  application,  and  there  are   numerous   other   documents
    establishing that the sponsor lived at the property for a  considerable
    period of time.   In  the  circumstances  it  does  not  appear  to  be
    speculative to conclude that she was  paying  the  rent  on  a  monthly
    basis, as described in her  oral  evidence.   Despite  the  lack  of  a
    written tenancy agreement or rent book, therefore, I find that  it  has
    been established on balance of probabilities that the sponsor  and  her
    husband were renting the property put forward in the applications.   It
    was not suggested, at any stage, that the property  would  not  be  big
    enough to accommodate the three appellants without overcrowding.

16.  There was no challenge to any of the financial evidence.  At  the  date
    of decision the sponsor was a part-time production worker  for  a  food
    company,  and  also  ran  her  own  tailoring  business.   The  various
    financial documents establish that she was earning an average  of  �450
    per week net.  In addition  her  then  husband  was,  at  the  date  of
    decision, employed on a full-time basis.  The documentary  evidence  of
    the sponsor's  finances  at  the  date  of  decision  included  a  bank
    statement showing savings of around �5,000; a business account  showing
    a balance of around �880; and an Indian bank account showing a  balance
    of Rs1,42,428.  There is also reference to the sponsor's  ownership  of
    property in India,  but  it  appears  that  there  was  no  documentary
    evidence of this.  She has said that these were  inherited  shops  from
    her father, which generate  rental  income.   Even  without  this  last
    matter, however, the evidence of income and savings was  sufficient  to
    show that  the  maintenance  requirements  were  met  at  the  date  of
    decision.  As I have said this aspect was effectively conceded  at  the
    hearing, with the exception of a submission that  it  would  have  been
    preferable to see more tax documents for the relevant tax year.   Again
    this appears to me to be a relatively peripheral criticism, and not one
    that could lead to the conclusion, on a consideration  of  all  of  the
    evidence provided, that the maintenance requirements had not  been  met
    at the date of decision.

17.  My findings on the points at  issue  are  therefore  as  follows.   The
    sponsor  has  established,  on  balance,  that  she   did   have   sole
    responsibility for the appellants at the date of decision.  It has been
    established, on balance, that the appellants' father had no involvement
    in their lives from 2006 onwards, and that this position was formalised
    by the guardianship order obtained in 2010.  On the  second  ground  of
    refusal I find that it has  been  established,  on  balance,  that  the
    appellants would have been adequately maintained  and  accommodated  at
    the date of decision.  On the sub issue as to whether the  sponsor  and
    her husband were living together at the date of decision  I  find  that
    this has been established through other evidence, despite the fact that
    the sponsor's husband  was  not  on  the  electoral  register  at  that
    address.  As for the status of the Indian court guardianship document I
    find that this was accepted in the appeal in  2010.   No  evidence  has
    been put forward to indicate that it is not genuine.

18.  For these reasons I have decided that the evidence does establish  that
    the appellants  met  the  sole  responsibility  and  accommodation  and
    maintenance requirements of the Rules at the date of decision.  It  has
    not been suggested by the respondent that they do not  meet  any  other
    aspects of the Rules.  The decisions were therefore not  in  accordance
    with the law and the Immigration Rules.

19.  As I have mentioned  above  it  will  now  be  for  the  respondent  to
    consider the current  position.   I  merely  record  that  the  sponsor
    provided a letter from her  landlord,  about  her  current  address  in
    Bolton, indicating that the appellants would be able to join her there.
     She also provided further bank statements  showing  that  the  sponsor
    continues to have a healthy income, and a high level  of  savings.   In
    addition a letter from a letting agent about a proposed  tenancy  at  a
    different address in Bolton was provided.  This may indicate  that  her
    current address in Bolton would  not  be  large  enough,  or  that  she
    intends to move for other reasons, but that is a matter  that  was  not
    discussed at the hearing, and will now be considered by the respondent.

20.  No submissions were made as to fee awards.  The decisions allowing  the
    appeals rest on evidence that was provided with the  applications.   In
    the circumstances there does not appear to be any reason to depart from
    the practice of making whole fee awards  in  such  circumstances  where
    appeals are allowed.

Decision

21.  The decisions by the judge dismissing the appeals  are  set  aside  for
    the reasons given above.

22.  The appeals are remade as follows. The appeals of all three  appellants
    are allowed under the Immigration Rules.



    Fee Awards        Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decisions in the appeals  by
    allowing them, I have considered whether to make a fee award (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007).


    I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note:  Fee  Awards
    in Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


    I make whole fee awards in the sum  of  �140  for  each  of  the  three
    appellants.
