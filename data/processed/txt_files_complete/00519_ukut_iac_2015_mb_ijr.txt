             IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW


                                   Before

                      MR C M G OCKELTON, VICE PRESIDENT
                       UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CLIVE LANE

                                   Between

                       The Queen on the Application of
                              MAZANOV BAKHTIYAR
                                                                   Applicant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

   Mr A Tear of Duncan Lewis Solicitors appeared behalf of the Applicant.


   Ms N Greaney, instructed by the Government Legal Department appeared on
   behalf of the Respondent

   1. The costs recoverable by the respondent on a Mount Cook basis  include
      the costs incurred in considering whether to contest the claim and, if
      so, summarising the grounds of defence; they are to be assessed on the
      same basis as if the respondent had engaged  a  solicitor  in  private
      practice.


   2. The respondent in cases nominally brought  against  the  Secretary  of
      State is the government, and it is the  government's  costs  that  are
      recoverable.


   3. Internal payments and charges within government are not an  indication
      of  the  government's  recoverable   costs,   and   cannot   therefore
      demonstrate a breach of the indemnity principle.


   4. A rate of charge for the AoS that  is  below  the  relevant  Guideline
      Hourly Rate for the relevant grade  of  lawyer  is  not  shown  to  be
      unreasonably high and will be allowed on summary assessment.


                              DECISION ON COSTS

Background

   1. The applicant, a national of Azerbaijan, came to the United Kingdom on
      13 October 2013.  Although he had a visit visa (valid for only a short
      time thereafter) he was refused entry  as  a  visitor.   He  thereupon
      claimed asylum.  He was refused asylum; an appeal  was  dismissed  and
      permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused.  On 6 December
      he made an application  for  assisted  voluntary  return  to  his  own
      country, and by 9 December all his appeal rights had  been  exhausted.
      His application for assisted voluntary return was approved,  whereupon
      he withdrew it.  On 3 January 2014 removal directions were set for  10
      January.  On 6 January he made further submissions, and on 9  January,
      the day before his  proposed  removal,  he  filed  a  judicial  review
      application with the Upper Tribunal, also seeking urgent consideration
      and interim relief by way of a stay on his removal.


   2. The application for interim relief was dealt with by Judge Latter  who
      granted the stay, but observed as follows:


           "Whilst  I  have  considerable  concerns   about   why   further
           representations relying on a newspaper article  published  on  5
           December 2013 were only made on 8 January 2014 when  notice  was
           given on 3 January 2014 of removal  directions  for  10  January
           2014, I cannot at this stage discount the possibility  that  the
           application for a fresh claim might not be completely devoid  of
           merit.  In these circumstances I am satisfied  that  this  is  a
           proper case for a stay on removal pending consideration  of  the
           fresh claim and in particular the provenance and reliability  of
           the newspaper article relied on, and if an adverse  decision  is
           reached,  the  applicant  and  his  representatives   having   a
           reasonable opportunity of considering a decision."


   3. The  next  step  was  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  put  in  her
      acknowledgement of service and summary grounds ("AoS").  The  AoS  was
      submitted on 20 February 2014.  The Secretary  of  State  also  sought
      prompt consideration of the applicant's claim, because he remained  in
      detention.  The summary grounds of defence run to 11 pages;  22  pages
      of documents are appended to them.  The grounds begin by  setting  out
      the recent history, including reference to a  new  decision  dated  20
      February 2014.   They then set out the applicant's immigration history
      at paragraph 3.  Paragraphs 4 to  26  set  out  the  relevant  law  in
      general terms.  Paragraphs 27 to 28 summarise the applicant's grounds.
       Paragraphs 29 to 33 set out  the  respondent's  case.   Paragraph  34
      summarises the latter, and seeks an order that the applicant  pay  the
      respondent's costs for "filing the Acknowledgement of Service, summary
      assessed at �400 (based on 2 hours time spent at �200 per hour)".  The
      appended documents include the respondent's  decision  letters  of  16
      January 2014 and 20 February 2014, both of which post-date  the  issue
      of the claim.


   4. The application for permission came before Judge Storey on the papers.
       He refused permission.  He noted as follows:

           "In November 2013, the First-tier Tribunal  had  concluded  that
           the Applicant had not given a credible account of risk on return
           in Azerbaijan.  The Respondent  has  since  considered  the  new
           evidence relied on by the Applicant, including the newspaper and
           online articles, and was quite entitled  to  find  that  it  was
           unreliable, applying Tanveer Ahmed principles.


           As regards Article 8, it is clear that the applicant  could  not
           meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   The  evidence
           placed before the Respondent - on the Applicant's own account he
           had only come to the UK in October 2013 - failed to disclose any
           compelling or exceptional circumstances such as might justify  a
           grant of leave  outside  the  Immigration  rules  on  Article  8
           grounds.


           The Respondent was  entitled  to  conclude  that  there  was  no
           realistic prospect of a  hypothetical  tribunal  judge  applying
           anxious scrutiny and considering  both  the  new  materials  and
           those considered previously, finding in the Applicant's favour."

   5. Judge Storey also directed that oral renewal of  the  application  for
      permission was not without further order to operate as a  bar  to  the
      applicant's removal from the United Kingdom.


   6. There has, so far as we are aware, been  no  subsequent  challenge  to
      those parts of Judge Storey's order.  It is not now suggested that the
      applicant's claim is, or ever was, properly arguable.


   7. Judge Storey also ordered the applicant to pay the respondent's  costs
      of the AoS in the sum of �400, unless within seven days from the  date
      of his decision the applicant notified the Tribunal in writing that he
      objected to paying costs, or to the amount to be paid, in either  case
      giving reasons.  It is the issue of costs  that  remains  outstanding.
      Again through his solicitors, the applicant appears to acknowledge his
      liability in principle to pay costs, but objects to the  amount.   The
      objection has, in the time since Judge Storey's order, separated  into
      two strands.  The first strand relates to the time spent on  preparing
      the AoS.  On considering the  applicant's  challenge,  the  Government
      Legal Department conceded that the charge  for  two  hours'  work  was
      incorrect: the appropriate charge was for one  hour,  twelve  minutes,
      that is to say twelve (6-minute) units of time.


   8. The second strand of challenge, the live issue before us,  relates  to
      the Government Legal Department's hourly rate.  The  applicant  argues
      that the Secretary of State is not entitled to costs based at  a  rate
      of �200 per hour, for two reasons.  First, he asserts that costs  paid
      at that level would breach the indemnity principle: that  is  to  say,
      the Secretary of State would receive more than she is required to  pay
      the Government Legal Department for the latter's services.   Secondly,
      the applicant claims that the amount of �200 an hour  is  unreasonably
      high.


   The legal structure


   9. The application before us raises issues in relation to  five  separate
      but interlocking principles.  The first, the "Mount  Cook  principle",
      is derived from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Mount Cook Land
      Ltd and another v Westminster City Council [2003] EWCA Civ  1346.   In
      judicial review proceedings a defendant  who  has  filed  an  AoS  and
      successfully resists  the  application  for  permission  is  generally
      entitled to recover the costs of doing so but  (again  generally)   no
      more than that. Mount  Cook  itself  is  largely  concerned  with  the
      circumstances in which such a defendant may be awarded  the  costs  of
      attending an oral permission hearing, but it confirms the decision  of
      Collins J in R (Leach) v Commissioner for Local Administration  [2001]
      EWHC 445 (Admin) in relation to the costs of the AoS.  The reasons why
      those costs are recoverable is that given by Collins J and  summarised
      in Mount Cook at [54]:


           "Since the new procedure imposes on a defendant who seeks to
           take part in and contest a judicial review claim an obligation
           to file an acknowledgment of service containing a pleading of
           his case, it is only fair that he should be awarded his costs
           if, as a result, he successfully resists it at the permission
           stage."


  10. In the course of his submissions, Mr Tear argued that Mount Cook costs
      are limited to the actual acknowledgment of service itself, that is to
      say (in time terms) the time spent in filling in the form and  writing
      the summary grounds of defence, with no allowance for reading the file
      or other preparation.  We suppose that submission is based on a phrase
      used by Collins J in Leach at [15], where  he  refers  to  the  'costs
      incurred  in  actually  producing  the  acknowledgement'.    But   the
      submission is clearly wrong.  As Auld LJ giving the lead  judgment  in
      Mount Cook said at [51]:


           "There is now a positive obligation  on  a  defendant  or  other
           interested party served  with  the  claim  form  to  acknowledge
           service and to consider in doing so: 1) whether to  contest  the
           claim, and, if so, on what grounds and at what stage; and 2)  if
           he decides to contest  it,  to  summarise  his  grounds  at  the
           permission stage."


  11. That is the obligation imposed on the defendant, and it  follows  that
      that is the work for which he can claim his costs.  An  interpretation
      of the principle as allowing costs only for a lesser  amount  of  work
      would be inconsistent with the reasoning of both  Collins  J  and  the
      Court of Appeal.


  12. The second principle is the "indemnity principle".  An award of  costs
      is compensation (or,  more  usually,  partial  compensation)  for  the
      successful party's expenditure on legal advice  and  assistance.   The
      award of costs is made to the party, but it is not intended to  enable
      the party to make a profit.  Therefore the award may  not  exceed  the
      party's legal costs.   So  far  as  solicitor  and  client  costs  are
      concerned, the indemnity principle is traceable back as far as  Harold
      v Smith (1860) 5 H & N 381.  It appears in s 60(3) of  the  Solicitors
      Act 1974, but the statement of the  principle  is  there  confined  to
      cases 'to which a contentious business agreement  relates'.   However,
      the principle in statutory form goes back at least to the proviso to s
      5 of the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1870, and in Eastwood (which  we
      discuss below) Brightman J (sitting with assessors at first  instance)
      noted at pp.120-1 that there is no difference in principle  for  these
      purposes between the effects of a contentious business agreement where
      a solicitor is paid a salary or retainer and the Crown's  use  of  the
      Treasury Solicitor.


  13. The third principle is  the  "summary  assessment  principle".   Where
      costs are assessed summarily, the amount ordered to be  paid  will  be
      the amount sought in the statement of the successful party, subject to
      reduction  or  refusal  for  any  claim  that   is   unreasonable   or
      disproportionate.  The process is not a detailed examination, which is
      a different process.  It follows from this principle that, where there
      is to be summary assessment, a small difference between what is sought
      and what might have been obtained after detailed assessment  does  not
      affect the award.




   Eastwood


  14. The two remaining principles are derived from  RC  Eastwood  deceased,
      Lloyds Bank v Eastwood [1975] Ch 112,  a  decision  of  the  Court  of
      Appeal, of course binding on us.  The litigation  in  Eastwood  was  a
      construction summons  of  a  will  involving  charitable  gifts.   The
      Attorney  General  was  therefore  involved  and  was   the   eleventh
      defendant.  Following the resolution of the litigation,  the  Attorney
      General,  who  had  been  represented  throughout  by   the   Treasury
      Solicitor, sought his costs.  The amount sought, in  addition  to  �73
      disbursements, was �130, all properly  described  as  "profit  costs",
      that is to say costs other than disbursements.  Of the �130,  �75  was
      justified as "instructions for hearing".  It was expressed to  include
      the perusal  and  consideration  of  the  originating  summons,  will,
      affidavits and exhibits and opinions  of  counsel,  and  also  various
      attendances, conferences and letters, and:


           "General  consideration,  care  and  conduct  of   this   fairly
           troublesome matter on behalf  of  HM  Attorney-General,  over  a
           period of some two years, the case being dealt  with  throughout
           by a senior solicitor".


  15. The reported litigation relates solely to that �75.  The Taxing Master
      proposed reducing the amount to �45,  and  made  a  decision  to  that
      effect  despite  the  objections  of  the  Attorney  General.    Based
      apparently on what  he  thought  was  a  concession  by  the  Attorney
      General, he decided that �45 "is adequate to cover  the  actual  costs
      incurred in doing all the work done".  The additional  �30  "therefore
      represents the fee which would have been charged to his  client  by  a
      solicitor in private practice for the general care and conduct of  the
      matter and in recognition of  the  legal  knowledge  and  professional
      skill brought to the matter by the solicitor; that  is,  shortly  put,
      the profit element".   He  decided  that,  because  of  the  indemnity
      principle, if a party uses a solicitor in  salaried  employment,  "the
      bill of costs may not include any sum for care and conduct which is in
      the nature of profit".


  16. As Brightman J pointed out in hearing the  Attorney  General's  appeal
      against the Taxing Master's decision, there is an element of ambiguity
      in the use of the word "profit".   All  of  the  �75  was  claimed  as
      "profit cost"; the �30 represented what he called the "top part":  the
      bottom part was the profit costs attributable to  the  salary  of  the
      solicitor engaged in the case in the Treasury Solicitor's  office  and
      the other expenses of the office.  Brightman J accepted the advice  of
      the assessor sitting with him, which was that the  usual  practice  at
      the time in taxing a bill of costs was to quantify the amount of  work
      done and attribute to it  an  appropriate  hourly  rate,  including  a
      reasonable estimate of the overhead expenses of the  solicitor's  firm
      and salaries.  This was described as the "A" element.  To  this  would
      be applied a discretionary uplift, the "B" element reflecting  further
      profit costs.  Brightman J was persuaded by the arguments  of  counsel
      for the executors that where the solicitor is  a  salaried  solicitor,
      the A element accounts for all the costs  actually  incurred  by  that
      party and that to  add  a  B  element  would  therefore  infringe  the
      Indemnity Principle.  He accordingly  endorsed  the  decision  of  the
      Taxing Master.


  17. The Attorney General  appealed  to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  which  as
      Brightman J had also done, reviewed the authorities.  In the Court  of
      Appeal, the  Attorney  General  made  it  clear  that  the  concession
      apparently relied upon by the Taxing Master had never been made.   The
      Court took the view that, whatever may  be  the  general  approach  in
      relation to taxing the costs between a solicitor and a private client,
      the AB approach only works on the basis that there is going to be a  B
      element.  As Russell LJ, who gave the judgment of the Court, said  (at
      p.131):


           "If you  embark  on  an  AB  exercise,  in  which  A  is  really
           meaningless unless accompanied by B, you cannot stop short  with
           A alone.  If it were, because it is not a case of an independent
           solicitor, inappropriate to use the AB  exercise  at  all,  some
           quite different exercise would be called for."


  18. In argument, Mr Peter Gibson (as he then was) pointed out  that  there
      is no good reason for supposing that, in general, the remuneration  of
      employed solicitors will be less than the remuneration  of  solicitors
      in private practice.  The cost of providing the  appropriate  part  of
      the remuneration lies with the litigant in either  case.   Russell  LJ
      cited the following example (ibid):


           "Suppose a solicitor in independent practice with  an  assistant
           solicitor, two legal executives, clerks and  typists  and  other
           overheads,  who  in  year  1  works  in  fact  exclusively   for
           corporation X.  For year 2 it is arranged that his whole  office
           and staff is taken over as a department of  corporation  X,  the
           solicitor also becoming an employee  of  the  corporation  at  a
           salary commensurate with a profit made by him in  year  1  doing
           the corporation's legal  work.   Suppose  that  in  year  1  the
           corporation was successful in a piece of litigation in which  in
           fact one of the legal executives did all the work: in taxing the
           corporation's costs the taxing master would apply the  A  and  B
           conventional method and the figure for  the  discretionary  item
           would be �75.  Suppose in year 2 the corporation  is  successful
           in exactly comparable litigation, again with the legal executive
           doing the work: if the method of taxation adopted in  this  case
           were followed, only A (�45)  would  be  allowed  for  the  item,
           though the change would not have  effected  any  saving  to  the
           corporation, who, instead of paying the profit to the  solicitor
           in respect of that  litigation,  would  have  paid  to  him  the
           equivalent in the form of a  proportion  of  his  salary.   This
           example seems to us to demonstrate that there must be  something
           wrong in  an  approach  which  uses  only  the  A  of  the  A  B
           conventional method in the case of an employed solicitor."


  19. Russell LJ went on to say  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  viewed  "with
      horror" the immensity of the task of calculating, for  each  piece  of
      litigation,  the  actual  cost  of  all  the  resources  used,  in  an
      organisation employing its own solicitors: there might be  rare  cases
      where the taxed costs would exceed what was necessary for the purposes
      of indemnity, but even that was preferable to a  detailed  calculation
      in all cases.  The conclusion was summarised in four  propositions  as
      follows:


           "(1) It is the proper method of taxation of a bill in a case  of
           this sort to deal with it as though  it  were  the  bill  of  an
           independent solicitor, assessing accordingly the reasonable  and
           fair amount of a discretionary item such as this, having  regard
           to all the circumstances of the case.


           (2) There is no reason to suppose  that  the  conventional  A  B
           method is other than appropriate to the case of both independent
           and employed solicitor.


           (3) It is a sensible and reasonable presumption that the  figure
           arrived at on this basis will not infringe  the  principle  that
           the taxed costs should not be more  than  an  indemnity  to  the
           party against the expense to  which  he  has  been  put  in  the
           litigation.


           (4) There may be special cases in which  it  appears  reasonably
           plain that that principle will be infringed  if  the  method  of
           taxation appropriate  to  an  independent  solicitor's  bill  is
           entirely applied: but it would be impracticable and wrong in all
           cases of an employed solicitor to require a total exposition and
           breakdown of the activities and expenses of the department  with
           a view to ensuring that the principle is not infringed... ."


  20. The decision in Eastwood has survived attacks in  the  High  Court  in
      Maes Finance Ltd v W G Edwards & Partners [2000] 2 Costs LR 198 (Elias
      J) and in the Court of Appeal in Cole v British Telecommunications plc
      [2000] 2 Costs LR 310.  In the latter case the principle of  assessing
      costs as though they were the costs of a privately  engaged  solicitor
      was applied despite the fact that the  successful  defendant  supplied
      figures said to be  the  hourly  costs  of  solicitors  in  its  legal
      department that were not immediately reconcilable  with  the  bill  of
      costs it had  tendered.   Both  those  cases,  like  Eastwood  itself,
      demonstrate the difficulty in the case of an  employed  solicitor,  of
      determining to which of A and B a particular item of costs  should  be
      attributed.


  21. In terms of the A B method, the decision in Eastwood has no doubt been
      overtaken by the introduction of composite fees and  guideline  hourly
      rates.  That, however, is a mere matter of the method of  calculation.
      Eastwood is clear authority for the proposition that  the  process  of
      calculation of the costs to which the successful party has been put by
      the litigation is the same whether that party has engaged a  solicitor
      in private practice or employed a solicitor as  part  of  his  or  its
      organisation.  That principle, which we call the  "employed  solicitor
      principle", is the fourth of the five principles to which we  referred
      earlier.


  22. The fifth principle we will call the "presumed  indemnity  principle".
      It is to be derived from  para  (4)  in  the  Court's  conclusions  in
      Eastwood.  It is perhaps not entirely  clear  whether  the  Court  was
      saying that in a "reasonably plain" case  the  calculation  should  be
      undertaken, or whether it was saying that even  in  such  a  case  the
      calculation should not be undertaken.  Bearing in the mind the  status
      of the indemnity principle, however, and the Court's use of the phrase
      "in all cases" (our emphasis), we are  prepared  to  assume  that  the
      Court considered that in a case where it was "reasonably  plain"  that
      the  indemnity  principle  would  be  infringed,   a   more   detailed
      calculation might be necessary.


  23. In the present case, the applicant accepts the position as set out  by
      Eastwood.  He accepts both the employed solicitor  principle  and  the
      presumed indemnity principle.  He submits, however,  that  this  is  a
      case where it is reasonably plain that the indemnity principle will be
      infringed if the Secretary of State's costs are awarded on  the  basis
      upon which she has claimed them.


   The representation of the Respondent


  24. In this litigation, the respondent is represented  by  the  Government
      Legal  Department,  under  the  Treasury  Solicitor.    The   Treasury
      Solicitor is incorporated  as  a  corporation  sole  by  the  Treasury
      Solicitor Act 1876.  The Treasury Solicitor's  department  and  staff,
      called since 1 April 2015 "The Government Legal Department", is a non-
      ministerial department of government: it is an executive  agency.   It
      represents a large number of government departments in litigation  and
      assists in other legal matters.  Since 1991 it has operated  a  system
      under which it charges for legal services supplied to other government
      departments and agencies.  (Here and elsewhere we make our findings of
      fact about the nature and practice of the Treasury Solicitor  and  the
      Government Legal Department on the basis of witness statements by  Tim
      Hurdle, the department's finance director,  Caroline  Featherstone,  a
      deputy director and James Heyhoe, a grade 6 lawyer).


   The applicant's submissions


  25. The introduction of the Treasury Solicitor's billing system means that
      identifiable  sums  of  money  passed  between  the  Government  Legal
      Department and other departments.  Mr Tear bases his submissions about
      breach of the Indemnity Principle on his identification of  such  sums
      of money and the relevant charging rates.  In order to understand what
      is meant by  phrases  such  as  "employed  solicitor"  and  "party  to
      litigation" in  a  case  like  this,  and  like  Eastwood,  where  the
      successful party is represented by the Government Legal Department  we
      must make an excursus into the nature of government.  We do that  with
      the assistance  of  the  speeches  of  the  House  of  Lords  in  Town
      Investments Ltd & others v Department of  the  Environment  [1978]  AC
      359.


  26. Statutory counter-inflation measures  in  force  in  the  early  1970s
      prevented an increase in rent  on  the  renewal  of  certain  business
      tenancies.  For present purposes it is  sufficient  to  say  that  the
      impact of  the  relevant  provision,  article  2(2)  of  the  Counter-
      inflation (Business Rents) Order 1972 was limited to:


           "Any tenancy where the property comprised in the tenancy  is  or
           includes premises which are occupied by the tenant  and  are  so
           occupied for the purposes of a business carried on by him or for
           those and other purposes... ."


  27. The Minister of Public Buildings and Works,  and  his  successor,  the
      Secretary of State for the Environment (to whom the relevant functions
      were transferred in 1970) had as one of his functions the provision of
      accommodation for  civil  servants  employed  in  all  departments  of
      government.  In the exercise of that function the minister took leases
      of office buildings in  Oxford  Street  and  North  Audley  Street  in
      London.  They were  occupied  as  government  offices,  housing  civil
      servants and others undertaking a variety of business  including,  for
      reasons which are likely to remain mysterious, an  agency  of  the  US
      Navy in a large part of one of the buildings.  At no relevant time was
      anyone in the buildings occupied in the work of the Ministry of Public
      Buildings and Works or of the Department of the Environment.   On  the
      expiry of the leases in 1972, the landlords offered to  grant  renewed
      leases at substantially increased rents.  They could do so only if the
      counter-inflation provisions did not apply.  At first instance and  in
      the Court of Appeal the landlord succeeded  on  the  ground  that  the
      tenant was the person named in the lease, that is to say  the  Minster
      of Works and his successor the Secretary of State for the Environment,
      and that, as no part of either of the premises was occupied  "for  the
      purposes of a business carried on by him", article 2(2) did not apply.
       The House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal by  a
      majority: the leading speech was given by Lord Diplock; Lord Morris of
      Borth-y-Gest was the only dissentient.  The speeches raise a number of
      issues, only one of which is relevant for present purposes.


  28. So far as concerns the issue we have  identified,  Lord  Diplock  said
      that it was necessary to decide who the  tenant  was.   The  Court  of
      Appeal was wrong to treat this:


           "as a pure question of construction of the leases themselves, as
           if Her Majesty, the Ministry of Works and the Secretary of State
           for the Environment were all persons to whose  relationships  to
           one another and to third parties  the  ordinary  principles  and
           concepts of private law applied."


     The truth of the matter is that:


           "It  is  not  private  law  but  public  law  that  governs  the
           relationships  between  Her  Majesty  acting  in  her  political
           capacity, the government departments among which the work of Her
           Majesty's government is distributed, the ministers of the  Crown
           in charge of the various departments and civil servants  of  all
           grades who are employed  in  those  departments.  ...  [Acts  of
           government are commonly attributed  to  'the  Crown',  but  some
           difficulties of comprehension could be] eliminated if instead of
           speaking of 'the Crown' we were to speak of 'the government' - a
           term appropriate to embrace both collectively  and  individually
           all of the minsters of the Crown and  parliamentary  secretaries
           under whose direction the administrative work of  government  is
           carried on  by  the  civil  servants  employed  in  the  various
           government departments.  It is through them that  the  executive
           powers of Her Majesty's government in  the  United  Kingdom  are
           exercised,  sometimes  in  the  more  important   administrative
           matters in Her Majesty's name, but most often  under  their  own
           official designation.  Executive acts  of  government  that  are
           done by any of them are acts done by any of them are  acts  done
           by 'the Crown' in the fictional sense in which  that  expression
           is now used in English public law.  ... The leases were executed
           under his official designation by the Minister of the  Crown  in
           charge of the government department to which, for administrative
           and accounting purposes, there is entrusted  the  responsibility
           for acquiring and  managing  accommodation  for  civil  servants
           employed in other government departments  as  well  as  that  of
           which the minister himself is the official head.  In my opinion,
           the tenant was the government  acting  through  its  appropriate
           member or, expressed in the term  of  art  in  public  law,  the
           tenant was the Crown."(at 380-381)



  29. Thus, the distinction between different departments and their minsters
      was for these purposes irrelevant.  The tenant was the government, and
      the business done  in  the  premises  was  government  business.   The
      counter-inflation provisions applied.


  30. In the course of his speech agreeing with Lord Dipock, Lord  Simon  of
      Glaisdale remarked at p.399 that  "the  mere  fact  of  incorporation,
      which  is  only  for  administrative  convenience,  does  not  make  a
      Secretary of State or a minister or a ministry an entity separate from
      the  Crown",  and  at  p.400  drew  attention  to:  "The   fundamental
      constitutional doctrine that the Crown in the United  Kingdom  is  one
      and indivisible".   Interestingly,  in  his  dissenting  speech,  Lord
      Morris of Borth-y-Gest noted at p.394 that certain provisions  of  the
      leases would have "no possible reason" if the tenant is to be regarded
      as the government as a whole, rather than some smaller unit.  But  the
      decision of the majority makes  it  clear  that  those  considerations
      simply do not apply.  It is a matter  subject  to  the  principles  of
      constitutional and public law, not the choices of private law.


  31. The present case is not about  a  lease,  nor  is  it  about  counter-
      inflation  provisions.   It  is,  however,  about  government.    Town
      Investments makes a number of things clear  beyond  argument  for  the
      purposes of the present application.  First, the respondent,  although
      nominally the Secretary of State for the Home Department is, in truth,
      the government,  or  'the  Crown'.   Secondly,  the  Government  Legal
      Department, under the Treasury Solicitor, is part of the same "one and
      indivisible" entity.  Thirdly, the costs that can properly be  claimed
      by the respondent are therefore to be based on the costs to which  the
      government (not merely the Secretary of State or  her  department)  is
      put to in defending  the  claim.   Fourthly,  internal  payments,  for
      example between the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Government  Legal
      Department, cannot be relied upon as demonstrating  the  cost  to  the
      respondent, because neither  of  them  is  'the  government'  or  'the
      Crown'.  Fifthly, whatever  accounting  arrangements  may  be  imposed
      between the Government Legal Department and any  other  department  or
      agency, the Treasury Solicitor and  the  Government  Legal  Department
      remain part of the executive  process  of  government,  part  of  'the
      Crown'.  They are the government's in-house solicitor and the  payment
      arrangements do not separate them or give any  reason  to  treat  them
      like a solicitor in private practice engaged by a client.


   The finances of the Government Legal Department


  32. On behalf of the applicant, Mr Tear has submitted a  table  of  hourly
      rates for chargeable hours for "Litigation Group, Employment Group and
      Central Advisory Team" in the Treasury Solicitor's department, current
      on 25 June 2013.  The rates are as follows:




   |                                                    |�      |
|Head of Division                                    |165.00 |
|Senior Civil Service                                |128.00 |
|Senior Lawyer (G6)                                  |108.00 |
|Lawyer (G7), Junior Lawyer (LO)                     |93.00  |
|Senior and Higher Executive Officers (SEO, HEO)     |78.00  |
|Legal Trainee, Executive and Administrative Officers|61.00  |
|(ET, EO, AO)                                        |       |




  33. These are the  rates  at  which  the  work  of  the  Government  Legal
      Department is charged to other departments when that work  is  subject
      to an hourly rate.  Mr Tear on behalf  of  the  applicant  appears  to
      assume that all the work of the respondent was done by a  Grade  7  or
      Junior Lawyer and argues that the appropriate amount is  therefore  to
      be based on an hourly rate of �93.00.  Any  greater  recovery  by  the
      Secretary of State would, he argues, infringe the indemnity principle,
      and would obviously do so, because it is clear that the rates  in  the
      table are the rates that the Secretary  of  State  pays  the  Treasury
      Solicitor or Government Legal Department for services  in  litigation.
      If it be said that it is appropriate for the  Secretary  of  State  to
      claim more by way of costs  because  of  some  other  (and  apparently
      undisclosed) costs of running the Government  Legal  Department  as  a
      whole, that is either an unauthorised process of taxation or  a  claim
      by way of costs for more than is required  to  indemnify  against  the
      costs of litigation.


  34. The evidence before us shows the following.  First of  all,  the  work
      was undertaken by Mr Heyhoe, whose  chargeable  rate  is  �108.00  per
      hour.  In  any  event,  however,  the  Government  Legal  Department's
      billing system is not strictly comparable to the  process  used  by  a
      solicitor in private practice when calculating the charge  to  clients
      or inter partes costs. There  are  a  number  of  differences,  partly
      deriving from the simple fact that the Government  Legal  Department's
      charges to other departments are calculated on the basis of government
      policy in such calculations rather than the considerations that  apply
      to the calculation of a bill of costs by a private solicitor.   Unlike
      in the private sector, where the hourly charge relates only  to  those
      doing legal work, and thus incorporates the appropriate proportion  of
      any associated clerical work, the Government Legal Department's hourly
      rates are, as the table shows, charged in relation to each  member  of
      staff.  Thus in order to discover the chargeable time it is  necessary
      to add the time spent on non-legal work (at the appropriate  rate)  to
      time spent on legal work (at the  appropriate  rate).   Secondly,  the
      assessed cost of office  overheads  is  divided  equally  amongst  all
      members of staff from the head of department down to the most  junior.
      There is no attempt to attribute them to  those  who  in  the  private
      sector would be chargeable fee earners.  The  invoice  raised  by  the
      Treasury Solicitor, which we have seen in a redacted version,  is  for
      �1,518.90 for work and this case, including work by two EOs,  two  AOs
      and a Senior Civil Servant.


  35. The 2012-13 accounts show that the Treasury Solicitor had in that year
      a surplus of �3,539,000 (although that is not the  difference  between
      the income and the incurred costs).  A surplus of this sort may  arise
      because the  charging  rates  are  calculated  in  advance,  based  on
      assumptions about the calls there will  be  on  the  time  of  various
      members of the department.  The Government Legal Department,  and  the
      Treasury Solicitor's Department before it, does not  seek  to  make  a
      profit; a surplus of this sort is paid to HM Treasury and becomes part
      of general government funds.


  36. Although the Government Legal Department is required to  charge  other
      government departments and agencies for its legal services, there  are
      a number of other costs that are not covered by the chargeable  hourly
      rates.  Government Legal Department employees act as advisory  lawyers
      to other government departments. In that capacity they give advice  on
      litigation strategy, and in their capacity as  advisory  lawyers  they
      may  assist  in  formulating  the  response  to  a  claim  or   attend
      conferences with counsel.  The cost of that work is  not  included  in
      the hourly rate but is paid for by way of a  fixed  fee  paid  by  the
      department to the Government Legal Department.


  37. There are, in addition,  Government  Legal  Department  costs  falling
      generally on the government.  HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office incur
      costs in providing what is described as "oversight, financing,  advice
      and  other  services  (e.g.  access  to   cross-government   framework
      contracts, management of the government  estate)".   Those  costs  are
      costs  which,  in  the  private  sector,  would  be  incorporated   as
      appropriate, in a fee earner's hourly rate.  They do not form part  of
      any  charge  made  by  the  Government  Legal  Department   to   other
      departments.


  38. We therefore reject Mr Tear's submissions in relation to the indemnity
      principle.  The consideration in paragraphs 33 and 35  show  that  the
      hourly rate of the lawyer would be the wrong figure  to  take  if  the
      rate paid by the Secretary of State to the Government Legal Department
      were to be the basis of assessment.  The decision in Town  Investments
      shows that all the figures in the  table  are  irrelevant:  the  costs
      being repaid are the government's costs, not the sums of money paid by
      one  department  to  another.   No  method  has  been   proposed   for
      determining how much of the costs of government  are  attributable  to
      this  application.   That  task  is  almost  certainly  impossible  to
      accomplish accurately, and would be disproportionately expensive.


   A reasonable rate


  39. As this is a  summary  assessment  there  is,  finally,  the  question
      whether �200 an hour is an unreasonably high rate for  the  Government
      Legal Department to charge.  There is no direct point  of  comparison,
      because nobody else has to defend immigration judicial reviews brought
      against the Secretary of State.  But the rate of �200 an hour is below
      even the Grade B guideline hourly rate for central London (�242);  the
      hourly rate for someone like  Mr  Heyhoe,  with  8  years'  litigation
      experience would be the Grade  A  rate  of  �317  per  hour.   In  the
      applicant's solicitors' firm, Duncan Lewis & Co, it  appears  that  no
      work was done by anybody other than a Grade A lawyer, and the work  is
      charged at �350 per  hour.   There  is  not  the  remotest  scope  for
      argument that �200 per hour is an unreasonably high rate.




 Conclusions

     i) Following Eastwood, the Secretary of State for the Home Department,
        as a successful party to litigation, is  entitled  to  claim  costs
        calculated in  the  same  way  as  costs  of  litigation  would  be
        calculated in the private sector.  Like any other litigant, she  is
        subject to the indemnity principle, that is to say, the  rule  that
        the costs claimed cannot exceed the expense to which the party  has
        been put by the litigation.


    ii) The Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  is  the  nominal
        defendant in an immigration judicial review; but the party  to  the
        litigation is in truth the government, technically called in public
        law 'the Crown'.


   iii) Even if the costs were to be calculated on the basis of the amounts
        of money the Secretary  of  State  pays  to  the  Government  Legal
        Department, it would be wrong to confine the costs  to  the  hourly
        rate for lawyers, because that rate  does  not  take  into  account
        factors which would be taken into account if  a  charge  was  being
        made  by  a  solicitor  in  private  practice  to  a  client.   The
        appropriate sum could only be reached by adding to the lawyer's the
        rate, the rates for all other members of staff engaged in the work,
        and a part of the fixed fee paid for advisory lawyers.


    iv) Because, however, the successful party is the Crown, other  general
        overhead costs of the Government Legal  Department  also  fall  for
        consideration and charge.  It would be an unrealistically expensive
        and perhaps  impossible  task  to  calculate  precisely  the  costs
        attributable to the production of an  Acknowledgement  of  Service.
        The presumption in Eastwood applies.  It is not "reasonably  plain"
        that the indemnity principle will be infringed by payment  at  �200
        per hour.


     v) �200 per hour is not, in the circumstances of the case,  an  amount
        that is unreasonably  high.   On  a  summary  assessment  there  is
        therefore no basis for interfering with it.


  40. We affirm the order in relation to costs made by Judge Storey.
