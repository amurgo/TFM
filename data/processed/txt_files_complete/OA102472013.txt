Representation:

For the claimant: Not represented
For the appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Shabih Rizvi, date of birth 29.5.84,  is  a  citizen  of
    India.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Miles, who allowed the  claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent to refuse  his  application  for
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a Tier 2 Migrant.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 15.4.14, allowing it on the basis of  private  life
    under article 8 ECHR.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    22.5.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 3.7.14 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  On that occasion there was no attendance by or on behalf  of
    the claimant. A telephone call to  his  legal  representative  revealed
    that they claimed not to have received notification of the hearing date
    and only discovered the day before that it was listed on 3.7.14. In the
    circumstances, it was too late to instruct  counsel.  The  hearing  was
    then adjourned, relisted for 27.8.14.

 5.  On  8.8.14  the  claimant's  representative  wrote  to  the   Tribunal
    indicating that their client no  longer  wished  to  proceed  with  the
    appeal and sought to withdraw  it.  A  reply  was  sent  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal explaining that as this was an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, the claimant could not withdraw the appeal. However,  they  were
    advised that if the  claimant  is  not  represented  at  the  adjourned
    hearing  the  judge  may  decide  to  proceed   in   the   absence   of
    representation of the claimant and decide the appeal on  such  material
    as is before him, including the request to  withdraw  the  appeal,  "as
    indicating that your client does not have a case to advance against the
    grounds of application for  permission  to  appeal  and  the  grant  of
    permission."

 6. There was no attendance by or  on  behalf  of  the  appellant.  In  the
    circumstances  I  decided  to  proceed  with  the  appeal  hearing   in
    accordance with the advice given to the appellant's representatives.

Error of Law

 7. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Miles should be set aside.

 8. In essence, the grounds assert that the judge failed to have regard  to
    the relevant Immigration Rules in making the article 8  assessment,  in
    particular the judge failed to address private life under 276ADE. It is
    also submitted that only if there may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside the  Immigration  Rules  would  it  be
    necessary  to  proceed  to  consider  whether  there   are   compelling
    circumstances insufficiently recognised under the Rules  (Nagre  [2013]
    EWHC 720 (Admin)). It is submitted that the judge  failed  to  identify
    good grounds and compelling circumstances.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Colyer found, "it  is  arguable
    that in his assessment of the  appellant's  private  life  there  is  a
    failure by the judge  to  consider  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  amended
    immigration rules before coming to his conclusion that the decision  of
    the respondent was disproportionate. The grounds disclose  an  arguable
    error of law."

10. For the reasons set out below, I find  that  there  were  a  number  of
    errors of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    such that it should be set aside and remade.





11. The relevant history is as follows:

      a) December 2009 the appellant arrived in the UK with leave as a  Tier
         4 student to 17.4.11;

      b) 3.1.12 Tier 2 leave was granted to expire 12.12.14 for work at  the
         Tier 2 sponsor JML;

      c) 1.2.12, employment with JML commenced;

      d) 23.12.12, the Tier 2 sponsor's licence expired and was not renewed;

      e) 8.4.13, the respondent curtailed  leave  to  expire  7.6.13,  under
         paragraph 323A(b)(i), on the basis that his sponsor ceased to  have
         a sponsor licence;

      f) 12.4.13, allegedly unaware that the licence had  expired  and  that
         his leave had been curtailed, the  appellant  travelled  to  India,
         where he was married on 17.4.13;

      g) 13.5.13, the appellant was refused entry  to  the  UK  because  his
         sponsor's licence had expired and he was  therefore  without  entry
         clearance. When curtailed leave results in there being less than  6
         months remaining leave, by the operation of the Immigration  (Leave
         to Enter and Remain) Order 2000, that leave lapses in its  entirety
         when the person leaves the UK. As a visa national the appellant had
         no suspensive right of appeal against the decision to refuse  leave
         to enter;

      h) 29.5.13, the appellant was removed to India;

      i) 21.6.13, appeal against refusal of leave to enter came before Judge
         Glossop, who found that there was no appealable  decision  and  his
         notice of appeal was invalid;

      j) 24.6.13, a new Tier 2 licence was issued to JML;

      k) October 2013: Upper Tribunal Judge Renton set aside the decision of
         Judge Glossop  on  the  basis  that  under  section  89(1)  of  the
         Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  the  appellant  had  a
         right of appeal under section  84(1)(c),  on  the  basis  of  human
         rights;

      l) A new Tier 2 Migrant application made for entry clearance;

      m) 27.3.14, the application for entry clearance as a  Tier  2  migrant
         was refused with limited rights of appeal;

12. The new Tier 2 application was refused because the appellant previously
    had leave in that category in the preceding 12 months. That is entirely
    consistent with the Immigration Rules restricting further  applications
    for Tier 2.  The guidance provides: "You  will  also  not  be  able  to
    reapply to return to the UK under Tier 2 until  12  months  after  your
    last leave under Tier 2 expired or can show you have been  outside  the
    UK for 12, whichever is sooner. This will be the case even if you  have
    been in Tier 2 for less than 6 years."

13. By the operation of section 89 of the 2002 Act, the appellant has  only
    limited rights of appeal against a decision to refuse leave  to  enter.
    Essentially, the only relevant ground is human rights. In  other  words
    there can be no valid appeal against the decision under the immigration
    rules on immigration grounds other  than  in  respect  of  private  and
    family life. The appellant does not assert family life but only private
    life.

14. The grounds complain that before going  on  to  consider  private  life
    under article 8 ECHR, the judge  failed  to  consider  the  appellant's
    private life under paragraph 276ADE. However, at �17 in noting that the
    appellant asserts that the decision to refuse  leave  to  enter  is  in
    breach of his private life under article 8 ECHR, the judge stated,  "he
    does not argue that he can succeed on the private  life  provisions  in
    the immigration rules in that regard." In other words,  it  was  common
    ground that the appellant did not meet the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE. That is, however, a factor that should have been  brought  into
    account in any proportionality assessment.

15. At �19 the judge considered, under the  case  law  as  it  then  stood,
    whether there were arguably good grounds for granting leave  to  remain
    outside  the  Immigration  Rules  and  whether  there  were  compelling
    circumstances insufficiently recognised under the Rules.

16. The Secretary of State submits that  there  were  no  good  grounds  or
    compelling circumstances to consider article 8 outside the  Immigration
    Rules. In one sense that is a disagreement with the  judge's  findings.
    However, there are serious concerns with the way  in  which  the  judge
    reached the conclusion that there were both good grounds and compelling
    circumstances for considering article  8  outside  the  Rules,  and  in
    reaching the conclusion that the decision was disproportionate.

17. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there were no  sufficiently
    compelling circumstances to justify granting entry  clearance.  I  find
    the judge's article 8 assessment flawed and the decision to  allow  the
    appeal one which no reasonable Tribunal could reach on the evidence and
    facts of this case.

18. I also find  in  any  event  on  a  straightforward  article  8  Razgar
    proportionality  balancing  exercise  that  the  interference  to   the
    appellant's private life is not sufficiently  grave  so  as  to  engage
    article 8 and even if article 8 is so engaged, which I do not accept, I
    find that the decision is entirely proportionate.

19. The decision to refuse leave to enter was entirely consistent with  the
    Immigration Rules. The  sponsor's  licence  had  lapsed  and  thus  the
    appellant's leave was curtailed, leaving him 60  days  to  find  a  new
    sponsor. The appellant and his  employer  both  claim  that  they  were
    unaware that the licence  had  lapsed  and  that  his  leave  had  been
    curtailed before he left the UK. However, whether or not the  appellant
    was aware, it was indisputable that the licence had lapsed and that his
    leave had been curtailed. It is unfortunate for the  appellant  but  on
    leaving the UK with less than 6 months leave remaining had  the  effect
    of bringing his entry clearance  leave  to  an  end.  Thus  immigration
    officers were entirely  correct  to  refuse  leave  to  enter  when  he
    returned to the UK in May 2013. It also is correct that he has no right
    of appeal against the operation of those  aspects  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and other subordinate provisions.

20. The treatment of the appellant at  the  point  of  entry  was  entirely
    lawful and consistent with the law. He could not be  granted  leave  to
    enter as he had no entry clearance.  As  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    pointed out, the Immigration Officer applied the law as it  stood  when
    making the decision and the appellant was treated in the  same  way  as
    any other person in similar circumstances in  making  the  decision  to
    refuse leave to enter.

21. The appellant's appeal is against that decision, the refusal  of  leave
    to enter the UK on 13.5.13 at a time when the appellant  had  no  valid
    entry clearance. Whilst it is unfortunate  if  the  appellant  was  not
    aware before he left the UK that his  leave  had  been  curtailed,  the
    Secretary of State was not to know that he  would  do  so  and  in  the
    process miss receipt of the letter advising  him  of  the  curtailment.
    Neither is it for the Secretary of  State  in  making  the  curtailment
    decision to consider all eventualities, including  that  the  appellant
    might choose to absent himself from the  UK  and  thereby  trigger  the
    termination of his entry clearance.

22. It is intended that the Immigration  Rules  are  a  complete  code  and
    reflect  the  Secretary  of  State's  response  to  and  inclusion   in
    considerations of article 8 private and family life.


23. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) has  set  out,  inter  alia,  that  on  the  then  state  of  the
    authorities:


            (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on  the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin);


           (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such as
           Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount:
           MF (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria  [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC);
           Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013]  UKUT  00045  (IAC);  they
           concern  the  practical  possibilities  of  relocation.  In  the
           absence of such insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to
           show other non-standard and  particular  features  demonstrating
           that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


24. Only if there were arguably good grounds for granting leave  to  remain
    outside the rules was it necessary for the judge for Article 8 purposes
    to go on to consider whether there were  compelling  circumstances  not
    sufficiently recognised under the Rules. It  is  illustrative  that  in
    Gulshan the Upper Tribunal considered that it was not unduly harsh  for
    a husband who originated from Pakistan but was now a British  national,
    to return to Pakistan with his wife who was seeking leave to remain  as
    his spouse. The panel acknowledged that the couple  would  suffer  some
    hardship, as he had been in the UK since 2002, he had worked  here  and
    was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and other state  benefits,
    some of which could not be transferred to Pakistan.


25. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:


    (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify  in  her
         decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
         prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
         the materials before it.

     (ii)  "Maintenance of effective immigration  control"  whilst  not  as
         such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR  can  normally
         be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of  disorder  or
         crime" or an aspect of "economic  well-being  of  the  country"  or
         both.

     (iii)  "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is  normally  a  legitimate
         aim both in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct
         on the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases where there have
         only been breaches of immigration law.

     (iv)  MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held that the new  immigration
         rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal  are  a  complete
         code. This was because  of  the  express  requirement  in  them  at
         paragraph 398 to have regard to exceptional circumstances and other
         factors.

     (v)    It follows from this that any other rule which  has  a  similar
         provision will also constitute a complete code;

     (vi)  Where an area of  the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

26. Although the case law continues to develop,  the  current  position  is
    perhaps best expressed in paragraph 135  of   R(MM  (Lebanon))  v  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985:

         "135.  Where the relevant group of IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."


27. Thus before the Tribunal could consider  the  appellant's  private  and
    family law rights outside the Immigration Rules, it would have to  find
    that there is no "complete  code"  for  consideration  of  his  private
    and/or  family  life  circumstances  within  the   Immigration   Rules.
    Paragraph 276ADE is the Secretary of  State's  response  to  article  8
    private life. It provides a balanced consideration  of  the  claimant's
    circumstances where he does not meet the  long  residence  requirements
    for leave to remain. However, it has no relevance to an application for
    entry clearance. In the circumstances, there is no such 'complete code'
    and thus a Razgar approach is appropriate  without  the  need  to  find
    compelling circumstances.


28. However, one has to consider what it is about the  decision  to  refuse
    leave to enter in May 2013 that infringes  the  appellant's  rights  to
    respect for his private life. The decision did no more than  apply  the
    law to the appellant's circumstances. I fail to see how  his  right  to
    respect for his private life requires the Secretary of State  to  grant
    him leave to enter when he  had  no  extant  entry  clearance  and  his
    sponsor's licence had expired.  Conversely,  I  fail  to  see  how  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance amounts to  such  interference  with
    his private life so as to engage article 8 ECHR at all.  The  appellant
    has no right to enter the UK except in accordance with the  Immigration
    Rules, which it is acknowledged he cannot meet. That he has  previously
    worked in the UK carries little weight. Article 8 is not a shortcut  to
    compliance with the Rules and is not  strengthened  by  the  degree  to
    which he fails to meet the Rules for entry clearance.

29. Even if article 8 private life is engaged  the  crucial  issue  is  the
    proportionality balancing exercise between on the one hand  the  rights
    of the claimant to respect for his private life, and on the  other  the
    legitimate and necessary aim of the state to protect the economic well-
    being of the country through the objective application  of  immigration
    control. The claimant does not have any private life in the UK  at  the
    present time and such relationships as he had he can  maintain  through
    modern means of communication. In essence his claim  is  to  return  to
    employment within the UK. However, in that regard he is not entitled to
    entry simply because of past employment or even the present  desire  of
    himself and his employer that he should continue to be employed. It  is
    unfortunate for him that his leave lapsed on leaving the  UK,  or  that
    had he not left he may still have been able to remain, but there is  no
    such thing as a near-miss principle in the Immigration Rules.


30. I am quite satisfied that the claimant's  circumstances  could  not  be
    described as compelling so as  to  justify  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  Even   on   a   Razgar   article   8
    proportionality balancing  exercise,  taking  into  account  all  those
    factors, I cannot see how any Tribunal could reach  a  conclusion  that
    the decision was disproportionate. It remains open to the  claimant  to
    make a fresh application for entry clearance,  provided  he  can  bring
    himself within the Rules. He had no right  to  reside  or  continue  to
    reside in the UK except in accordance with those Rules.


31. In the circumstances, there were errors of law in  the  making  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that it should  be  set  aside
    and remade. On the basis of the matters set out above, and in the light
    of the fact that the claimant no longer  pursues  his  application  and
    does not oppose the Secretary of State's refusal decision,  the  appeal
    must be dismissed.


Conclusions:

32. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
