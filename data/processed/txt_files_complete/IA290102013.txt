                        [No anonymity direction made]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     No attendance
For the respondent:    Mr D Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL

 1. The appellant, Aubin Didier Ntchuintouo, date of  birth  3.3.79,  is  a
    citizen of Cameroon.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Martins promulgated 25.9.14, dismissing his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 17.7.13, to  refuse  his  application
    for  an  EEA  Permanent  Right  of  Residence  Card,  pursuant  to  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    21.8.14.

 3. Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman granted permission to appeal on 3.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. However, received on 12.5.15, the day before the hearing, was a  letter
    from the appellant's instructed  solicitors,  Rana  &  Co,  seeking  to
    withdraw the appeal.

 6. The reasons cited in their letter, dated 12.5.15, is that the appellant
    believes that he qualifies for 10-year residence. In order to apply  on
    that ground he cannot have a pending appeal and make the application at
    the same time.

 7. In the circumstances, the Tribunal consents to the withdrawal, pursuant
    to Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

 8. It will be necessary for the Tribunal to notify the  parties  that  the
    appeal has been.

                    Dated       13 July 2015

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been withdrawn.
