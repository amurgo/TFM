Representation:

For the Appellant:         Mr G. � Ceallaigh, Counsel instructed by Samars
                       Solicitors
For the Respondent:          Mr C. Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are all members of the same family from Afghanistan. The
    First Appellant is the father; his dependents  are  his  wife  and  two
    daughters who are now aged 20 and 16. The Second Appellant is the adult
    son of the First Appellant and his wife.  I shall hereinafter refer  to
    the Appellants as F (father), M (mother), D1 (daughter 1), D2 (daughter
    2) and S (son).


 2. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed all of the  linked  appeals.   By  my
    decision dated the 4th July 2018  I  found  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination to be flawed for error of law and set it aside. I further
    found that the three female dependents to the claim had made out a well-
    founded fear  of  persecution  in  Afghanistan  for  reasons  of  their
    membership of  a  particular  social  group,  religious  belief  and/or
    imputed political opinion.   A copy of that 'error of law' decision  is
    appended and should be read as an integral part of this decision.

 3. The matter comes back before me for disposal in respect of the two male
    appellants, F and S.

 4. Mr � Ceallaigh advances the Appellant's case as follows:

         a. They face a risk of persecution  and/or  treatment  contrary  to
            Article 3 ECHR in Jalalabad because they have been targeted by a
            local businessman due to their religion;
         b. They face a risk of persecution  and/or  treatment  contrary  to
            Article 3 ECHR in  Jalalabad  because  of  their  religion,  and
            particularly having regard to the risk factors set out in TG and
            others (Afghan Sikhs  persecuted)  Afghanistan  CG  [2015]  UKUT
            00595 (IAC);
         c. They face persecution by reasons of persecution of  their  close
            family members;
         d. They cannot safely internally relocate.

 5. Before me he  concentrated  his  submissions  on  point  (c).    As  it
    happened he was right to do so because Mr Bates accepted on  behalf  of
    the Respondent that as a matter of law seeing serious harm visited upon
    a close relative could amount to persecution. He further accepted  that
    in circumstances where the women of the family faced  persecution,  and
    the adult men of the family would be seen, and would see themselves, as
    their 'protectors', that very relationship would place them at risk.


 6. Although one might think that proposition (c) needed no authority, Mr �
    Ceallaigh had some. In the case of Frantisek Katrinak  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 832 the Court  of  Appeal
    considered the case of a Czech Roma whose family had been subjected  to
    racist abuse, threats and violence by skinheads but  whose  appeal  had
    been dismissed by the Tribunal on the grounds that such events were not
    reasonably likely to occur again.   The events narrated had included  a
    single attack on the claimant, but also an assault  on  the  claimant's
    pregnant wife. In its assessment of future risk the Tribunal had  based
    its calculations on the fact that the claimant himself  had  only  been
    attacked once. Schiemann LJ, with whom  Tuckey  LJ  agreed,  identified
    three interrelated reasons why this was an  error.  It  overlooked  the
    fact that the past assault on the wife would raise the claimant's level
    of subjective fear, it suggested that the Tribunal  had  excluded  from
    its calculus the second attack, and it  failed  to  recognise  that  an
    attack on a family member could itself be persecution of the claimant:


         "21.... the  attacks  also  potentially  evidence  the  appellants'
         vulnerability in the future. An activity which would not amount  to
         persecution if done to some people may  amount  to  persecution  if
         done to others. It is easier to persecute a husband whose wife  has
         been kicked in a racial attack whilst  visibly  pregnant  than  one
         whose family has not had this experience. What to others may be  an
         unbelievable threat may induce terror in such a man.

         22. ....the tribunal's concentration on the 29 years  during  which
         this appellant had only had one attack and on whether "he would  be
         treated the same way again" gives rise to the suspicion that it did
         not bear in mind the possibility that a man may  be  persecuted  by
         what is done or threatened to his wife.

         23. Miss Laing submitted that the tribunal was under no  obligation
         to take into account what had happened to her and might  happen  to
         her again in the future. She submitted  that  that  would  only  be
         relevant if it could be shown that  the  notional  future  attacker
         intended by that attack to harm the husband. I  would  reject  that
         submission. If I return with my wife to a country where there is  a
         reasonable degree of likelihood  that  she  will  be  subjected  to
         further grave physical abuse for racial reasons, that puts me in  a
         situation where there is a reasonable degree of risk that I will be
         persecuted. It is possible to persecute a husband or a member of  a
         family by what you do to other members of his immediate family. The
         essential  task  for  the  decision  taker   in   these   sort   of
         circumstances is to consider what is reasonably likely to happen to
         the wife and whether  that  is  reasonably  likely  to  affect  the
         husband in such a way as to amount to persecution of him."

 7. It follows that I need not make any findings on the  historical  events
    that  the  Appellants  claim  occurred  in  Jalalabad  prior  to  their
    departure from Afghanistan, since they are not now  relevant  to  their
    case on future risk: that is based, for the purpose of  this  decision,
    on the fact that the women of this  family  are  confined  to  'virtual
    house  arrest'  in  order  to  avoid  harms  including  kidnap,  forced
    conversion and marriage.  As the Respondent now accepts, persecution of
    the women would constitute persecution of the men.


 8. The country guidance remains that given in TG where it was held that at
    local level there is not a sufficiency of protection for Sikhs.   Given
    the particular facts of this case I am not satisfied that there  is  an
    internal flight alternative. The harm feared by the women - and so  the
    men - would  persist  throughout  Afghanistan.    I  further  note  the
    evidence of Dr Giustozzi who concludes [at his paragraphs]:


           i) The family is unlikely to be able to secure accommodation  in
              Kabul (�39);
          ii) The family is unlikely to be able  to  secure  employment  or
              start an economic activity in Kabul (�37);
         iii) Accessing the Temple for prayers in Afghanistan is  difficult
              and dangerous (�34; 42);
          iv) Children and especially girls are at particular risk (�24; 26-
              28);
           v) Sikhs are perceived to be rich, whether they are or not,  and
              so may be targeted;
          vi)  Sikhs  and  Hindus  continue  to  be  harassed  by   militia
              commanders throughout Afghanistan (�10);
         vii) The police are hopelessly corrupt and incapable of protecting
              minorities and have  been  known  to  facilitate  kidnappings
              (�18);


 9. For those reasons, and the reasons  set  out  in  the  'error  of  law'
    decision, these appeals must be allowed on protection grounds.




      Decisions

10. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains  material  errors
    of law and it is set aside.


11. The decision in the appeals is remade  as  follows:  "the  appeals  are
    allowed on protection grounds".


12. Having regard to the fact that this is a protection claim I am prepared
    to make the following direction for anonymity, pursuant to Rule  14  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders.


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
        family.  This direction applies both to the Appellants and  to  the
        Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
        contempt of court proceedings".
