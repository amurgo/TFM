Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms. H. Foot of Counsel  instructed  by  Farani  Javid
                       Taylor, Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr. M. Shalliday, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  Designated  First-tier
      Tribunal  Judge  French  dated  1  September   2014   dismissing   the
      Appellant's appeal against a decision dated 4 July 2014 to remove  him
      from the UK.

Background

   2. The Appellant is a national of India born on 10  June  1985.  Relevant
      aspects of his personal and  immigration  history  are  summarised  at
      paragraphs 2 and 3 of the determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge:

"The Appellant obtained a BA degree in commerce whilst in  India.  He  first
      came to this country as a student in January 2007 to study for an  MBA
      in  business  administration  at  Liverpool  John  Moores  University.
      Thereafter he successfully applied  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  Highly
      Skilled Post-Study Worker and then as a Tier 1 Highly Skilled  General
      Migrant, leave being granted until  30th  December  2012.  Immediately
      before expiry of that leave he applied for an extension  in  the  same
      capacity but that was refused. An appeal  against  that  decision  was
      dismissed. Subsequently, the Appellant claimed asylum, on  26th  March
      2014, on the basis that he was at risk if he returned to India  as  he
      is homosexual. He claimed to fear his family,  the  police  and  other
      authorities. His sexual orientation is accepted by  the  Home  Office.
      The Appellant  also  relied  upon  his  relationship  with  a  British
      citizen, Kamran Qayum.

Following interview the Appellant's application was refused by letter  dated
      3rd July 2014 and on the following day a decision was made  to  remove
      him under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999."


   3. The Appellant appealed to the IAC. In his appeal the Appellant pursued
      arguments based on protection issues (claiming to be at risk in  India
      from relatives, society, and the authorities because he was gay),  and
      based on his family/private life in the UK, with particular  reference
      to his relationship with Mr Qayum.


   4. Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge French dismissed the  appeal  for
      reasons set out in his determination.


   5. The Judge noted that it was not in dispute that the Appellant was gay,
      and summarised part of his sexual history: determination at  paragraph
      29. However, the Judge concluded that the Appellant was not at risk of
      persecution, either from his family (though nonetheless  acknowledging
      that "the Appellant would find  it  unpleasant  and  uncomfortable  to
      return to" his home area  -  paragraph  31),  or  from  wider  society
      generally (paragraphs 32-33).


   6. The Judge was satisfied that family life existed between the Appellant
      and Mr Qayum:

"I accept that they have been together in a relationship since June 2013  (a
      little over one year), and that their intention is to  stay  together,
      and if possible buy a house, possibly  in  the  Manchester  area.  The
      relationship is genuine but it was formed at a time when the Appellant
      did not, of  course,  have  indefinite  leave  to  remain,  after  his
      application for variation of his previous leave had been refused,  and
      whilst an appeal was pending. The word "precarious" in Section 117B of
      the 2002 Act is not defined but given the fact that the Appellant  did
      not have any permanent status, in accordance with paragraph 117B(5)  I
      attach little weight to his private life, in respect of which  in  any
      event there was little evidence. That does not have an effect  on  the
      family life, which I find he shares with Mr Qayum. They are a couple."
      (Paragraph 34).




   7. The Judge  also  found,  at  paragraph  35,  that  "it  would  not  be
      reasonable to expect Mr Qayum to uproot and relocate to India" because
      of "substantial" difficulties there specified, albeit that  "they  may
      not amount to insurmountable obstacles".


   8. However, at paragraph 36 of the determination, the Judge decided  that
      the Appellant could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM:

"The Appellant cannot qualify under Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules  as
      he and Mr Qayum have not been in a relationship for two years (see GEN
      1.2(iv)). There is a fianc� route under  E-ECP2.1  to  4.2.  There  is
      therefore a route available to the Appellant to obtained leave to live
      in this country, albeit only exercisable from overseas.  There  is  no
      route available to the Appellant whilst he remains in this country."


   9. The Judge then went on to consider human rights, and concluded "in the
      circumstances,  given  the  facts  as   found,   it   would   not   be
      disproportionate to expect the Appellant to return to  India  to  seek
      entry clearance as a fianc�", adding "I find that in this case it  has
      not been shown that there are arguably good grounds for granting leave
      to remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  when  there  is  a  route
      available under those Rules and the burden imposed upon the  Appellant
      in seeking to comply with Rules is not an unreasonable one" (paragraph
      37).


  10. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  which
      was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Deans  on  16  October  2014.  The
      Grounds in support of the application for permission to appeal  argued
      that Judge French had erred in  his  approach  to  paragraph  EX.1  of
      Appendix FM, with particular reference to  GEN  1.2(iv).  In  granting
      permission to appeal Upper Tribunal Judge Deans considered the Grounds
      to be arguable, summarising them in these terms:

"The  application  for  permission  to  appeal  contends  that   the   judge
      misconstrued and misapplied the definition of a partner under Appendix
      FM. The Appellant's relationship was with a  proposed  civil  partner.
      The couple had been unable to register as civil partners  because  the
      Appellant's passport was with the Home Office."


Consideration

  11.  The  substance  of  the  grounds  of  challenge  as  drafted  in  the
      application for permission to appeal, and the premise of Judge  Deans'
      grant of  permission,  is  that  Judge  French  in  referring  to  the
      Appellant and Mr Qayum not having been in a relationship for two years
      had wrongly confined himself to the definition  of  'partner'  at  GEN
      1.2(iv) of Appendix FM, and had thus wrongly overlooked the definition
      of partner at GEN 1.2(iii), which included a "proposed civil partner".
      The Appellant's grounds contend that but for this error the  Appellant
      could have had the benefit of paragraph EX.1 -  which  he  could  have
      reached via the 'partner route' pursuant to R-LTRP.1.1.(d).


  12. However, it is clear to us that this argument overlooks the effect  of
      E-LTRP.1.12, which applies pursuant to  paragraph  R-LTRP.1.1.(d)(ii).
      This provides:

"The applicant's partner cannot be the  applicant's  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
      civil partner, unless the applicant was  granted  entry  clearance  as
      that person's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner."


  13. If GEN.1.2.(i) and (ii) did not apply,  and  GEN.1.2.(iii)  could  not
      avail the Appellant under the partner route, it  is  readily  apparent
      why the First-tier Tribunal Judge focused on GEN.1.2.(iv).


  14. Accordingly, we can identify no material error in the manner in  which
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge approached the definition  of  'partner'
      under Appendix FM of the Rules.


  15. However,  perhaps  because  she  recognised  the  limitations  of  the
      arguments advanced in the grounds in support of  the  application  for
      permission to appeal, Ms Foot presented us with  a  Skeleton  Argument
      which advanced different arguments. She sought permission to amend the
      grounds. Mr Shalliday indicated that he did  not  object  to  such  an
      amendment, and he did not seek further  time  for  the  Respondent  to
      consider her position in light of the amendment. Accordingly, we  were
      content to permit amendment of the grounds of appeal pursuant  to  the
      Tribunal's general  powers  of  case  management  (Tribunal  Procedure
      (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 as amended from 20 October 2014, rule 5(1)-
      (3), and in particular 5(3)(c)), and the 'overriding objective'  (rule
      2). We then heard argument from  the  representatives  on  the  issues
      raised in the Appellant's Skeleton Argument settled by Ms Foot.


  16. We trust that we do no disservice to Ms Foot's able written  and  oral
      submissions by distilling them to the following - bearing in  mind  in
      particular that the Skeleton Argument is a matter of record on file.

(i) Relying on, in particular, the authorities of MM  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985
      and Patel, Alam & Anwar v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72, she submitted that  the
      Immigration Rules and Convention rights are distinct  systems,  albeit
      usually overlapping, both considerably informed by notions of  'family
      values'. The Rules do not provide a complete code, and accordingly  it
      is still possible to succeed in an application  or  on  an  appeal  on
      Article 8 grounds, notwithstanding a failure to meet the  requirements
      of the Rules.

(ii) Pursuant to Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 it would  be  "only  comparatively
      rarely" that an Article 8 appeal should be dismissed on the basis that
      it be proportionate for an appellant to be required to apply for entry
      clearance from abroad. The case of MA (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA  Civ  953
      clarified that although Chikwamba referred to family  cases  involving
      children,  that  did  not  make  it  essential   to   a   finding   of
      disproportionality that there be children.

(iii) In Zhang [2013] EWHC 891  (Admin),  while  declining  to  declare  the
      provisions of paragraph 319C(h)(i) of the  Rules  to  be  incompatible
      with Article 8, the High Court, informed by Chikwamba, had found  that
      the 'no switching' rule for  a  Tier  2  migrant  -  which  in  effect
      necessitated leaving  the  UK  to  apply  for  entry  clearance  in  a
      different capacity in order to change from a Tier 2 migrant to  become
      a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) dependant - was unsustainable as a 'blanket
      requirement'. This was because "save  in  particular  cases  (such  as
      those involving a poor immigration record... or where  the  engagement
      of Article 8 is very tenuous...) it  will  be  rare  indeed  that  the
      immigration priorities of the state are such as  to  give  rise  to  a
      proportionate answer to Article 8 rights to family life" by  requiring
      such a migrant to leave the UK. (The Respondent  subsequently  amended
      the Rules, but there was no analogous  amendment  in  respect  of  the
      position of fianc�(e)s and proposed civil partners under Appendix FM.)

(iv) In SSHD v Hayat [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 the  Court  of  Appeal  considered
      the scope and application of the decision in Chikwamba and  offered  a
      summary of the effect of various subsequent decisions (per Elias LJ at
      paragraph 30). Ms Foot  emphasised  the  references  to  the  need  to
      consider the 'sensibleness' of enforcing a  policy  that  expected  an
      application  for   entry   clearance   to   be   made   from   abroad,
      notwithstanding establishment of family or private life in the UK  and
      the presence of the applicant in the UK.

(v) Ms Foot, while emphasising that in  general  terms  the  Appellant  does
      fall  within  the  definition  of  a  'partner'  under  Appendix   FM,
      recognised, and accepted, that the Appellant cannot qualify for  leave
      to remain under the fianc�(e)/proposed civil partner route  under  the
      Rules because he had not previously been granted entry clearance as Mr
      Qayam's proposed civil partner: see E-LTRP.1.11 and 1.12.

(vi) Although she did not say so in her Skeleton Argument, when  invited  to
      clarify her position, Ms Foot did not shy away from asserting that  E-
      LTRP.1.12  was  incompatible  with  Article  8  of   the   ECHR.   She
      acknowledged that, notwithstanding her reliance on  Zhang  by  way  of
      general analogy (Skeleton Argument at paragraph 23), her submission in
      this regard went further than the decision in Zhang.

(vii) In the alternative,  Ms  Foot's  principal  submission  was  that  the
      reliance on E-LTRP.1.12 in effect to require the  Appellant  to  leave
      the UK to apply for entry clearance ran contrary to the principles and
      guidance of the case law  starting  with  Chikwamba,  there  being  no
      sensible reason (as per Hayat) to defeat  the  Appellant's  Article  8
      claim on this basis.

(viii) It was noted that Mr Qayam  had  provided  evidence  that  he  earned
      between �22,000 and �24,000 per annum (determination at paragraph 18),
      although Ms Foot acknowledged that there was no supporting evidence of
      this, either generally,  or such as to comply with the requirements of
      Appendix FM-SE: see determination at paragraph 37. (In this context it
      was Ms Foot's position if Tribunal  decided  that  there  had  been  a
      material error of law the Appellant wished for a  further  hearing  at
      which supporting evidence of Mr Qayam's financial circumstances  could
      be provided.) It  was  submitted  that  the  possible  requirement  to
      conduct  a  detailed  evaluation  of  Mr  Qayam's  financial  position
      comparable with the requirements of the  Rules  could  not  reasonably
      amount to a sensible reason to require  the  Appellant  to  return  to
      India to seek entry clearance. Ms Foot also emphasised those  passages
      and  findings  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which
      acknowledged the 'uncomfortable' or 'unpleasant'  situation  that  the
      Appellant  would  face  in  returning  to  India   (determination   at
      paragraphs 30-33 and in particular paragraph 31).

(ix) In so far as Ms Foot's submissions sought to raise matters  not  argued
      before the First-tier Tribunal and to that  extent  amounted  in  some
      considerable degree to a re-arguing of the  appeal,  when  invited  to
      formulate the specific error of law that would justify  setting  aside
      the decision of Judge French, she submitted that the Judge  had  erred
      in considering that it would be reasonable for the Appellant to  apply
      for entry clearance from abroad, and had he not  so  erred,  it  would
      have been open to him to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.


  17. With all due respect to Ms Foot, it does seem to us that  this  latter
      formulation is little more than a disagreement with the outcome of the
      appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.  In  our  judgement  Ms  Foot's
      difficulty in formulating a specific error is largely results from the
      fact that she seeks to advance arguments not aired before  the  First-
      tier Tribunal - or indeed in the application for permission to appeal.
      Nonetheless, we have permitted amendment of the grounds of  challenge.
      Ms Foot's submissions both require and deserve consideration.


  18. For completeness we note that at one point during her  submissions  Ms
      Foot argued that the effect of E-LTRP1.12 was  discriminatory  against
      the Appellant as a homosexual,  but  she  subsequently  withdrew  that
      submission on the  basis  that  the  same  rule  applies  to  fianc�s,
      fianc�es, and proposed  civil  partners,  irrespective  of  gender  or
      sexuality.


  19.  Mr  Shalliday  for  the  Respondent   gratefully   acknowledged   the
      Appellant's concession - in contrast to the assertion in  the  grounds
      in support of the application for permission to appeal - that he could
      not meet the requirements of the Rules. In addressing the case as  now
      advanced, Mr Shalliday essentially made the following points:

(i) He did not take any particular issue with Ms Foot's recitation  of  case
      law, but emphasised the particular context of the  authorities  relied
      upon: for example the case of Patel was concerned with  paragraph  317
      of the Immigration Rules, and as such was not directly concerned  with
      a rule that had been  drafted  specifically  to  give  effect  to  the
      Respondent's obligations under Article 8, as was the underlying intent
      behind Appendix FM. He also emphasised the particular  factual  matrix
      of Chikwamba, involving a partner who was a refugee and who could  not
      be expected to return to Zimbabwe, and the presence of children in the
      UK. In respect of Zhang he emphasised  that  the  applicant  had  lost
      employment through leaving the UK to apply for  entry  clearance  from
      abroad, and to that extent the  'no-switching'  provision  had  had  a
      'very tangible effect'. Again he noted that Zhang was concerned with a
      'points-based system' rule, and not with a rule  specifically  drafted
      to give effect to the U.K.'s obligations under Article 8.

(ii) Mr Shalliday also emphasised that on the facts of this particular  case
      it had not been shown that the financial requirements of the Rules had
      been met, so the Judge was not engaged with an appeal where  the  only
      obstacle to succeeding under the Rules was the  requirement  of  prior
      entry  clearance.  He  submitted  that  this   was   another   factual
      distinction  between  the  present  case  and  the  circumstances   in
      Chikwamba.

(iii)  Mr  Shalliday  acknowledged  that  the  unpleasant  or  uncomfortable
      circumstances that the Appellant might face as  a  gay  man  in  India
      pending the processing of an application for  entry  clearance,  while
      relevant to an overall Article 8 evaluation, should not be  considered
      to be some sort of 'escape route' in circumstances where  he  had  not
      succeeded on his asylum claim.

(iv) As regards the extent of the interference in the  family  life  of  the
      Appellant and Mr Qayam pending processing of an application for  entry
      clearance from abroad, the Appellant had not produced any evidence  to
      show that such a process would be longer than reasonable, and to  that
      extent the factual premise of a grave or serious interference was  not
      established through evidence.

(v) Mr Shalliday argued that there was a clear, obvious,  and  sound  policy
      rationale for requiring fianc�(e)s  and  proposed  civil  partners  to
      apply for entry clearance. He identified the different definitions  of
      a partner at GEN.1.2, and noted that  in  respect  of  spouses,  civil
      partners, and cohabitees of at least two years  standing,  there  were
      necessarily evidential requirements as to either the formalisation  of
      such relationships or their longevity and durability. In contrast,  in
      order to present oneself as a partner by reference to an engagement to
      marry or proposed civil partnership, nothing more was required than an
      assertion of a proposal. Further, in respect of  marriages  and  civil
      partnerships there was also mechanism to protect the  public  interest
      against abuse by way of sham relationships via the obligations imposed
      upon registrars to report suspicious matters. In the circumstances, it
      was submitted, the requirement of  obtaining  entry  clearance,  being
      rooted in sound policy, was more than a simple procedural requirement.

(vi) Notwithstanding what was said in MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985,  the
      decisions in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan  (Article  8  -
      new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640  (IAC)  remained  good
      law. It was still necessary, to succeed under  Article  8,  where  the
      requirements of Appendix FM were not met, to identify non-standard and
      particular features of a compelling nature to show that removal  would
      be unjustifiably harsh.


  20. In considering the competing submissions in this appeal, we note  that
      we found nothing inaccurate or objectionable  in  the  recitation  and
      summary of case law relied upon by Ms Foot. In particular we found the
      distillation  in  Hayat  of  particular  assistance  because  it   was
      concerned specifically with "issues concerning the  proper  scope  and
      application of the decision of the House of Lords in Chikwamba"  (see
      paragraph 1 of the judgement), and contains  an  extensive  review  of
      authorities. We note the summary derived from  case  law  set  out  at
      paragraph 30 in the judgement of  Elias  LJ,  and  in  particular  the
      following at 30(c): "Whether it is sensible  to  enforce  that  policy
      will necessarily be  fact-sensitive;  Lord  Brown  identified  certain
      potential  relevant  factors  in  Chikwamba.  They  will  include  the
      prospective length and  degree  of  disruption  to  family  life,  and
      whether other members of the family are settled in the UK".


  21. In this latter context  we  note  and  acknowledge  the  force  of  Mr
      Shalliday's submission to the effect that the Appellant had failed  to
      advance any supporting  evidence  as  to  the  prospective  length  of
      disruption to family life he would likely face by pending  application
      for entry clearance from India


  22. We also accept Mr Shalliday's submission that the  essential  test  in
      Nagre and Gulshan - "to identify  other  non-standard  and  particular
      features of the case of a compelling nature to show that removal would
      be unjustifiably harsh" - still applies to an appeal,  such  as  this,
      where an Appellant seeks to rely  upon  Article  8  having  failed  to
      satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM.


  23. We have noted Mr Shalliday's  emphasis  on  the  factual  distinctions
      between some of the case law and the facts of this particular  appeal.
      Whilst we are alert to such factual  distinctions,  there  is  nothing
      specific, in our judgment, that undermines the general  principles  to
      be derived from the case law, or their  applicability  -  subject,  as
      ever, to a case-sensitive analysis - to the instant appeal.


  24. We do not accept Ms Foot's submission that E-LTRP.1.12 is incompatible
      with Article 8. It seems to us that this was an  expedient  submission
      rather  than  one  carefully  formulated  and  closely  supported   by
      authority. Indeed Ms Foot acknowledged that the  only  authority  upon
      which she could place reliance, Zhang, was not  only  in  a  different
      context, but did not reach a conclusion comparable to that  which  she
      sought. Mr Shalliday's submissions  relied  on  policy  considerations
      which on their face seek to strike a  balance  between  the  competing
      interests of the family/private lives of  individuals  and  the  wider
      public interest. In our judgement, something far  more  compelling  by
      way of an evidence-based  challenge  to  those  policy  considerations
      would be required in order to establish that this aspect of the  Rules
      is incompatible with Article 8. [See section 4 of the Human Rights Act
      1998].


  25. Moreover, the scheme of Appendix FM does not, in our judgment, contain
      for the partners of British citizens, the partners of persons  present
      and settled in the UK, or the partners  of  persons  in  the  UK  with
      refugee  leave,  or  humanitarian  protection  the  sort  of  'blanket
      requirement' of leaving the UK to seek entry clearance  that  was  the
      focus of concern in Zhang. The general immigration status requirements
      are set out at E-LTRP.2 .1 and are restricted to  an  applicant  being
      required not to be a visitor, a person with valid leave granted for  a
      period of six months or less (unless as a fianc�(e) or proposed  civil
      partner),  or  on  temporary  admission.  Outside   these   particular
      restrictions it is, therefore, open for any other category of  migrant
      to seek to switch to becoming a person  with  leave  to  remain  as  a
      partner. Indeed the combined effect of E-LTRP.2 .2 and  EX.1  is  such
      that it is possible for a person  present  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
      immigration laws to secure leave to remain as a partner. There  is  no
      extensive or 'blanket' prohibition on a person  seeking  and  securing
      leave to remain as a partner of a British citizen, or a person present
      and settled in the UK, or a person in the UK  with  refugee  leave  or
      humanitarian protection, in circumstances where they have entered  the
      UK  in  some  other  capacity,  or  even  have  entered  or   remained
      unlawfully.


  26. The prohibition under the Rules is, accordingly, limited to  the  sub-
      class of 'partner' as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil  partner,  and  we
      accept that this is for the policy reasons identified by Mr Shalliday.
      It is to be recalled that even this prohibition under the Rules may be
      mitigated on  a  case-by-case  basis  by  reference  to  the  residual
      discretion the Respondent retains outside the Rules, or, on appeal  by
      reference to a compelling Article 8 case.


  27. It is against this background that we consider the specific  challenge
      to the decision of Judge French.


  28. It seems to us that Judge French has set out, with manifest care,  the
      background  and  issues  in   the   appeal,   has   directed   himself
      appropriately to the burden and standard of  proof,  has  set  out  in
      adequate  detail  the  evidence  before  him,  and  has  recorded  the
      submissions of the parties. Further, he has made findings and  reached
      a conclusion on the Appellant's claim  for  protection,  to  which  no
      objection has been raised. He has also reached conclusions in  respect
      of Appendix FM in respect of which challenge is no longer pursued.


  29. Further it is manifestly the case that the Judge is not to be  faulted
      for not having engaged in any of the issues and  arguments  now  aired
      for the first time before us. Ms Foot (who did not appear  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal) acknowledged that she was seeking to present  the
      Appellant's case on a significantly different basis from that  put  to
      the First-tier Tribunal. We make no particular criticism of her for so
      doing, but nonetheless, as observed above, it necessarily reduces  the
      force of an argument that there was an error of law in the decision of
      the First-tier Tribunal. As we have said Ms Foot had some difficulties
      in formulating or identifying a specific error of law.


  30. Having found that the challenge to the underlying Rules must fail,  we
      find that the  Appellant  is  also  otherwise  unable  to  impugn  the
      reasoning of Judge French.


  31. We note that Judge French identified the Appellant's submission  based
      on Chikwamba, and the "waste of time and resources  if  the  Appellant
      had to return to come back as a fianc�"  (determination  at  paragraph
      28). The Judge made it plain in the 'Discussion and Findings'  section
      of his decision that he had considered this submission: see  paragraph
      37. The Judge, in substance, stated that any issue in respect of entry
      clearance was not limited to the  procedural  requirement  of  seeking
      entry clearance, but that the Appellant had also not shown that he had
      met the other requirements of Appendix FM -  including  in  particular
      the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE.


  32. What is of particular significance given the arguments before  us,  is
      that the Judge expressly directed  himself  to  the  judgement  in  in
      Hayat, and said "that the  core  question  was  whether  there  was  a
      sensible reason for enforcing the policy of requiring  application  to
      be made from abroad" (determination at paragraph 37).


  33. As we have  noted  above,  the  question  of  'sensibleness'  is  fact
      sensitive. It is essentially a matter for evaluation by the  decision-
      maker, and, in turn, for the  Tribunal  Judge.  We  consider  that  in
      addressing that question the Judge appropriately  had  regard  to  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules as a starting  point,  including
      both the substantive requirements, and  the  specific  requirement  of
      prior entry clearance. In this latter regard we accept that the policy
      considerations identified by the Respondent in the submissions  before
      us are such that neither a direct nor an approximate analogy with  the
      approach in Zhang is warranted. It is also apparent that the Judge had
      carefully considered the circumstances that the Appellant would likely
      encounter upon returning to India as a gay man. In  our  judgement  in
      his overall evaluation the First-tier Tribunal Judge was  entitled  to
      conclude, pursuant to  Nagre  and  Gulshan,  that  there  was  nothing
      inherent in the Appellant's case that justified a departure  from  the
      Rules on Article 8 grounds.


  34. Accordingly we reject the challenge to the decision of the  First-tier
      Tribunal. The decision of Judge French contained no errors of law  and
      therefore stands.
