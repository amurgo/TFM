For the Respondent:           Ms Z. Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting
                       Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Ghana born in 1997.   She  appeals  with
    permission[1] the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Mitchell)
    dated 15th July 2016 to dismiss her appeal against a decision to refuse
    to grant her entry clearance as the  child  of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom.


 2. The only matter in issue before the First-tier Tribunal was whether the
    Appellant's father had "sole responsibility" for her upbringing[2].  On
    this matter the Tribunal did  not  find  the  burden  of  proof  to  be
    discharged and the appeal was dismissed.

 3. The Appellant now has permission to appeal on the basis that in  making
    its findings, the Tribunal made mistakes of fact that were material  to
    the  reasoning  and  thereby  to  the  overall  decision,  on  in   the
    alternative failed to  take  material  evidence  into  account.   These
    alleged errors/omissions are particularised as follows:


              i) At paragraph 14 of its determination the  Tribunal  rejects
                 the  sponsor's  evidence  that  he  regularly  visits   his
                 daughter  in  Ghana  on  the  basis  that  there   is   "no
                 documentary evidence that the father regularly  visits  the
                 family"; this is not correct because  before  the  Tribunal
                 were  copies  of  his  passport  demonstrating  his  travel
                 history, showing annual trips to Ghana of between 1- months
                 duration.


             ii) At paragraph 15 the Tribunal refers to the letter  produced
                 from the Appellant's boarding school which  speaks  to  the
                 contact that she has with her father. The Tribunal  records
                 "The letter from the school unfortunately does not give any
                 indication as to whether the mother has  any  contact  with
                 the  school  and  whether  she  plays  any  part   in   the
                 appellant's life". This  is  not  correct.  The  letter  in
                 question is dated 20th June 2016 and appears  at  WT-23  of
                 the Appellant's bundle. The Headmaster Daniel Afari  writes
                 that the Appellant's mother has not paid a visit during the
                 three years that she has spent there.

            iii) At paragraph 16 the determination rejects the  evidence  of
                 the sponsor that he has  been  paying  for  his  daughter's
                 school fees from money kept in his Barclays  Bank  account,
                 stating "there is no evidence  whatsoever  that  money  has
                 been paid to Ghana for the support and school fees  of  the
                 appellant". This is not correct. The ECO had been  provided
                 with the Barclays Bank statements in question and these had
                 been reproduced in  the  Appellant's  bundle  at  WT-24-59.
                 These statements show large  sums  of  money  (�1000-�4000)
                 being transferred from a connected ISA account before being
                 withdrawn. At WT-23 there  is  a  letter  from  the  school
                 confirming that the sponsor pays the school fees.

             iv) At paragraph  18  the  determination  reads  "there  is  no
                 evidence   of   letters,    telephone    calls,    internet
                 communications or visits". This is not correct. In addition
                 of the evidence  of  visits  mentioned  above,  the  bundle
                 before the Tribunal contained a witness statement from  the
                 Appellant averring that she has received regular  telephone
                 calls from her father, a matter  confirmed  in  the  letter
                 from the school at WT-60 which explained that  as  students
                 are not permitted personal telephones, he  would  call  the
                 phone of the headmaster or  the  Appellant's  housemistress
                 Auntie Eugenia.

 4. Before me Ms Ahmad agreed that there had been, for whatever reason,  no
    heed paid to the evidence as it is set out above, and this has resulted
    in a number of significant factual errors on the part of the First-tier
    Tribunal.    She accepted that as a result the decision had to  be  set
    aside.


 5. The parties before me  agreed  that  I  could  proceed  to  remake  the
    decision in the appeal. The evidence in this entry clearance appeal had
    all been supplied to the ECO, or the ECM upon review. The sponsor Mr WT
    was present to answer any questions that Ms Ahmad had.




    The Evidence


 6. I have before me:


              i) Payslips and letters  from  WT's  employer  in  the  United
                 Kingdom;


             ii) Bank statements  from  three  different  accounts,  showing
                 substantial  savings  being  transferred  into  a  Barclays
                 current account before being withdrawn;


            iii) Three letters from Daniel Afari, Headmaster  of  Okuapemman
                 School in which it  is  confirmed  that  she  attends  that
                 school, that her father WT pays all of the fees,  that  her
                 father calls her there (as  set  out  above)  that  he  has
                 visited her regularly and that "there  is  a  great  father
                 daughter relationship".  Mr Afari states  that  the  mother
                 has never visited the Appellant;

             iv) Letter from the family doctor confirming that he treats the
                 Appellant and that it the sponsor who settles the bills;

              v) Copies of three WT passports (the originals were  available
                 at hearing) showing regular lengthy trips to Ghana.




 7. I have a statement from  WT  dated  5th  July  2016.  He  adopted  this
    statement and gave oral evidence as follows.


 8. He explained that he has been living and working in the United  Kingdom
    since his daughter was born. When she  was  born  she  lived  with  her
    mother, WTs older son (who was himself an adult  by  the  time  of  her
    birth) and WTs sister. They all lived in a shared family home in Accra.
    The Appellant's grandparents and  extended  family  all  live  in  "the
    village".


 9. The Appellant attended preparatory school as a little  girl,  and  this
    was paid for by WT.   When she was 12 she started at  boarding  school.
    When she was 14 she moved to the boarding school she  attended  at  the
    date of decision. He has always paid the fees, and it  is  he  who  has
    decided where she should be educated.  Her mother has  never  played  a
    part in those discussions. There are three  reasons  for  that.  First,
    because she herself is uneducated.  She would have little  contribution
    to make. Second, because in Ghanaian custom it is always the father who
    has responsibility for his children, and who would be the sole  arbiter
    of such matters. Third, the Appellant's mother has been suffering  from
    some debilitating, but as yet  undiagnosed,  mental  illness  for  some
    years now.

10. In respect of his wife's illness WT says that  she  has  been  seen  by
    doctors on numerous occasions and he has  been  informed  that  she  is
    suffering from "stress". She has been prescribed medication. He  cannot
    recall ever having been told what the diagnosis is beyond that. WT said
    that when he visits Ghana he sees his wife. She is very withdrawn.  She
    sits in her room and does not want to speak to anyone.    He  told  her
    that the Appellant was going  to  come  and  join  him  in  the  United
    Kingdom. She was happy about that but played no part in  the  decision.
    The main doctor is Dr Hayfron, who is the family physician. He has been
    their doctor for years and sees the whole family. He  does  not  charge
    'up front' and is happy for WT to settle the bills  when  he  comes  to
    Ghana.    WT was referred to his written statement  in  which  he  says
    that they are still one family  and  that  "none  of  the  parents  has
    abdicated responsibility".   He explained that he  has  never  divorced
    his wife, and continues to visit her on  his  return  trips  to  Ghana.
    Although they no longer have any meaningful relationship because of her
    illness, he still regards her as his wife. Obviously she is  still  the
    Appellant's mother. She is not however in a position  to  exercise  any
    responsibility, and in that sense is not able to  consciously  abdicate
    it either.  It is not by choice that she is in the situation  that  she
    is.  In response to my questions WT confirmed that the  Appellant  does
    see her mother, when she is on visits home from  boarding  school.  The
    last time that she saw her would have been during  the  2016  Christmas
    holidays. Her mother is however unable to care for her or offer her any
    material support: if anything the usual roles are reversed  and  it  is
    the Appellant who offers her mother assistance and support.

11. I also have before me a statement from the Appellant herself, dated 4th
    July 2016. She states that it is her father who has  always  taken  all
    the important decisions in her life, in  part  because  her  mother  is
    uneducated and in part because she is  unwell.  She  concurs  with  the
    Headmasters evidence about  her  father  calling  her  at  school,  and
    confirms that her father has supported her financially and visited  her
    twice per year. She concludes:

         "There is no decision I take without first referring the matter  to
         him. He is responsible for my health and he pays all medical bills.
         I only want to live with my father before I  start  an  independent
         life as an adult I want to spend some quality time with my father".




    My Findings

12. I have considered all of the evidence in the round, and have done so in
    light  of  the  guidance  given  in  TD  (Paragraph  297(i)(e):   "sole
    responsibility") Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049.  I note that the evidence of
    WT was unchallenged before me and having had the opportunity of hearing
    from his directly I am satisfied that he is a credible witness.


13. I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the sponsor  WT  is
    exercising "sole responsibility" over his daughter. It is apparent from
    the letters from the school, as well as the  evidence  of  WT  and  the
    Appellant herself  that  he  is  the  person  who  takes  all  material
    decisions about her life. Whilst he candidly  admitted  that  his  wife
    continues to physically see their daughter  from  time  to  time  -  ie
    during school holidays - it is his credible evidence that this  contact
    does not amount to  any  involvement  in  her  upbringing.    Ms  Ahmad
    correctly referred me to TD (Yemen) and to the  Tribunal's  observation
    that "where both parents are involved in a child's upbringing, it  will
    be exceptional that one of them will  have  "sole  responsibility".   I
    have considered that matter carefully. I am however satisfied that  the
    situation here is akin to that described in Alagon v ECO, Manila [1993]
    Imm AR 336. The Appellant's mother has  a  "passive"  interaction  with
    her. She cannot be regarded, on the evidence before me, of  having  any
    meaningful input into her daughter's life.   It  is  WT  who  pays  for
    everything, and who liaises with professionals such as the  doctor  and
    the school. More importantly it is he who has regular contact with  his
    daughter, pays a close interest in her life and is,  as  she  describes
    it, emotionally close to her: "Though my father is far away  physically
    I feel he is near".  In contrast her mother,  who  lives  in  the  same
    country, has no regular contact  with  her  apart  from  those  holiday
    visits home. Although I hear what WT says about his wife continuing  to
    be part of the family, and his concern  that  she  is  not  accused  of
    deliberately abandoning her child, the fact is that she  has  in  fact,
    through no fault of her own, abdicated responsibility.  It follows that
    the requirement in paragraph 297(1)(e) is met and the  appeal  must  be
    allowed.


    Anonymity Order

14. This case concerns a minor.  Having  had  regard  to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions


15. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside.


16. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows:


    "The appeal is allowed under the immigration rules"


17. There is an order for anonymity.
