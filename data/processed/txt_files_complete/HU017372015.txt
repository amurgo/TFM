                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms H Kujabi, Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal against a decision by Judge of the First-tier
      Tribunal Malcolm dismissing an appeal against a refusal of entry
      clearance.


   2. The appellant is a national of the Gambia.  She is now aged 20 but at
      the date of her application she was under 18 years of age.  The
      refusal decision against which the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
      was brought was made on 18 June 2015.


   3. Before us the appellant was represented by her mother, Mrs Haddy
      Kujabi, who was the sponsor of her application.  Mrs Kujabi was
      accompanied by and assisted by a friend, Mr Foday Sanneh.


   4. The appellant sought entry clearance to join her mother in the UK.
      The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal was not satisfied that the
      appellant and her mother were related as claimed and, in addition,
      that the appellant's mother had had sole responsibility for her
      upbringing.


   5. Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal on the basis
      that it was arguable that the judge materially erred in law in finding
      that the appellant had failed to prove her relationship with her
      mother in light of the evidence before the judge, which included a
      birth certificate dated 23 December 2014, an affidavit from the
      appellant's aunt, the sponsor's witness statement and oral evidence,
      flight tickets to Gambia and a copy of the sponsor's passport
      containing stamps.


   6. A rule 24 notice was lodged on behalf of the respondent.  This stated
      that the grounds of appeal were largely based upon evidence which post-
      dated the decision of 18 June 2015 and were simply an attempt to re-
      argue the case.  The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal gave cogent
      reasons for finding that the evidence fell short of establishing the
      relationship between the appellant and the sponsor.


   7. The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal expressed concern that the
      appellant's birth certificate was dated 23 December 2014.  The judge
      was given an explanation for this date in an affidavit from the
      appellant's aunt.  The appellant's original birth certificate did not
      give her middle name.  The appellant's middle name was given to her
      when she started school to distinguish her from other pupils with the
      same first and last names as her.  The judge considered that this
      discrepancy over the appellant's name raised an issue of identity.
      The original birth certificate was not produced to support the
      explanation, although according to the sponsor it had been found
      within the last few days.  The sponsor was aware of the possibility of
      providing DNA evidence but had chosen not to do so.  The sponsor
      maintained that she had sought to produce a card recording her
      pregnancy but this card had been lost in the post.  The judge
      concluded that the appellant had been made aware of the issues in the
      appeal but had failed to provide additional evidence.  The appellant
      had not provided sufficient evidence to satisfy the judge that she was
      related as claimed to the sponsor.


   8. In relation to the issue of sole responsibility the judge concluded
      that the sponsor's evidence of visits and payments made was not
      conclusive.  There were no details given of any decision making by the
      sponsor on important matters in the appellant's life and there were no
      detailed insights by the sponsor into the appellant's day-to-day life.


   9. Although we were provided with additional documentary evidence on
      behalf of the appellant, including the result of DNA tests, we have to
      approach the issue of whether the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
      erred in law on the basis of the evidence which was before the Judge
      of the First-tier Tribunal and to which the Tribunal was entitled to
      have regard.  On the question of the relationship between the
      appellant and the sponsor we are concerned by the judge's references
      in paragraphs 45, 46 and 48 to whether "sufficient" evidence had been
      provided.  In particular, the judge's conclusion expressed at
      paragraph 48 was set out entirely in terms of an alleged failure to
      provide "sufficient" evidence.


  10. The question of the relationship between the appellant and the sponsor
      was not a matter to be decided according to some arbitrary standard.
      The approach the judge should have taken was to look at the evidence
      adduced on behalf of the appellant and decide whether it was credible
      and reliable.  If the judge had found that the evidence could be
      relied upon, it was more than adequate to show the existence of the
      claimed relationship.  If there were unexplained discrepancies in the
      evidence which led the judge to conclude that no reliance could be
      placed upon it, then the judge would have been entitled to find that
      the relationship was not shown to be as claimed.


  11. There is an indication that the judge started with the proper
      approach, at paragraph 45, by referring to an alleged discrepancy in
      respect of the appellant's original birth certificate.  In making
      findings, however, the judge departed from the proper approach by
      referring to whether there was sufficient evidence.  We consider that
      by so doing the judge erred in law.  The judge did not give proper and
      adequate reasons for finding the appellant had not shown she was
      related to the appellant as claimed.  Because of this, the decision of
      the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


  12. Having set aside the decision of the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal,
      we consider that there is enough evidence before us to re-make the
      decision.  Although the DNA evidence was not before the original
      decision-maker or the First-tier Tribunal it may be taken into account
      as appertaining to the circumstances at the date of decision.  Mr
      Diwnycz suggested that the DNA report was incomplete but having
      studied the report, which states on its face how many pages it should
      contain, we are prepared to accept it.


  13. In relation to the birth certificate, the sponsor explained that the
      first birth certificate, referred to as a "nursing certificate", was
      issued by the hospital at the time of the appellant's birth.  This
      record of the birth could then be used to obtain an official birth
      certificate at a later date.  For our part we are puzzled as to why
      the date the birth certificate was issued should have been considered
      so significant by the respondent.  In general terms a birth
      certificate may be issued by the proper authorities at any time, for
      example to replace a lost or missing certificate, and the date of
      issue is not necessarily an indication of a lack of reliability.
      Having regard to the evidence and to the explanations given we are
      satisfied that the appellant and the sponsor are related as claimed.


  14.  We approach the issue of sole responsibility in accordance with the
      decision in TD (Yemen) [2006] UKAIT 00049.  Mr Diwnycz referred us to
      an affidavit of 3 March 2015 by the appellant's aunt referring to
      herself as the appellant's guardian.  Mr Diwnycz suggested that this
      document reflected a court decision in relation to the appellant but
      there was nothing on the face of the document to indicate that it had
      been prepared for the purposes of court proceedings.  It seemed to be
      no more than a document recording a family arrangement whereby the
      aunt would involve herself in the appellant's care while the sponsor
      was abroad.


  15. The evidence before us was that the appellant's father has had no
      contact with her since 2005 and takes no responsibility for her.  We
      were informed that the appellant's aunt, who was caring for her,
      relocated to Benin in 2016 and the appellant now lives with a friend.
      Of course, this change post-dates the decision appealed against.


  16. The sponsor explained that when she came to the UK with her husband
      she intended that the appellant would join her once she had indefinite
      leave to remain.  Sadly her husband died in 2012 shortly after the
      sponsor obtained indefinite leave and the sponsor had to delay
      applying for the appellant to join her.  The sponsor maintained that
      she had remained responsible for the appellant and the arrangement
      with her sister was only that the sister would provide care.  The
      sponsor made decisions about her daughter and provided money for her,
      including paying for tuition.


  17. We note that the sponsor visited Gambia in 2009, 2013 and 2014.  On
      each occasion she stayed with her sister and the appellant.  The
      sponsor's evidence is that she speaks to the appellant every 2-3 days
      and they also contact each other by WhatsApp.


  18. We are satisfied that there was before us evidence of a close
      relationship between the sponsor and the appellant maintained by
      visits, electronic communication and sending money.  We are satisfied
      that while the sponsor's sister was caring for the appellant on a day-
      to-day basis the sponsor was nevertheless responsible for major
      decisions such as those concerning the appellant's education and place
      of residence.  The reference by the appellant's aunt describing
      herself as the appellant's guardian was never intended to be more than
      a temporary arrangement, as it was intended from the start that the
      appellant would join the sponsor in the UK as soon as circumstances
      permitted.  As we have found, the sponsor is the appellant's mother
      and we are satisfied that she had sole responsibility for the
      appellant.


  19. The two remaining issues in the appeal are maintenance and
      accommodation.  On accommodation the evidence before us was that the
      sponsor lives in a two bedroom flat with a living room and dining
      room.  The sponsor lives in the flat with her other two children, a
      boy and a girl aged 9 and 10.  On the basis of this evidence we are
      satisfied that there would be adequate accommodation for the
      appellant.


  20. In relation to maintenance the evidence indicates that the sponsor has
      only a modest income with which to support herself and her children.
      Her Halifax bank statement dated 28 April 2015 showed a credit balance
      of �6,163.  The refusal decision was dated 18 June 2015 and the
      appellant's 18th birthday was a week later on 25 June 2015.  It was
      therefore necessary for the sponsor to show that she was able to
      support the appellant for no more than one week, until her 18th
      birthday.  On the basis of the sum available to the sponsor in her
      Halifax account we are satisfied that the sponsor would have been able
      to maintain the appellant for this period.


  21. On the findings we have made the appellant meets the relevant
      requirements of paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules and her appeal
      is therefore allowed.


  22. As the appellant meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules, we
      do not need to consider whether she would be entitled to succeed under
      Article 8.  In any event, where the requirements of the Immigration
      Rules are met it is difficult to envisage any public interest in
      refusing the appellant entry to the UK.

Conclusions

The making of the decision of the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal involved
the making of an error on a point of law.

We set aside the decision.

We re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.  We have not
been asked to make such a direction and see no reason of substance for
doing so.


Fee Award                            (N.B. This is not part of the
decision.)

No fee award is made.  Although we have evidence before us showing that the
test of sole responsibility is met some of this evidence was produced for
the purpose of the appeal and was not before the Entry Clearance Officer.
Without all the evidence now before us the ECO would have had difficulty in
finding the requirement of the sponsor having sole responsibility for the
appellant was met.
