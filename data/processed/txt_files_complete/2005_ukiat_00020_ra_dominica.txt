                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is a Home Office appeal in the  case  of  a  citizen  of  Dominica,
   against the decision of an adjudicator, Mrs P A G  Horvath,  sitting  at
   Taylor House on 2 March 2004.  Unfortunately, the  adjudicator  did  not
   have any help from a presenting officer at  the  hearing,  although  she
   made a commendable effort to go into all the facts.

2. This claimant had a long history of residence in this country,  latterly
   on the basis of a passport showing him to  be  a  'British  subject  and
   Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies' and endorsed with the  right
   of abode in the United Kingdom, issued on 18 September 1973 and expiring
   on 18 September 1983.  When the claimant tried to renew  that  passport,
   having been overseas since 1976, he was refused:  there  is  nothing  to
   indicate why.   It seems to us most  likely  that  he  would  have  been
   entitled at that point  to  the  benefit  of  �  11(1)  of  the  British
   Nationality Act 1981, since he had immediately before  the  commencement
   of that Act been a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies  with  the
   right of abode in the United Kingdom.

3. However, because of the decision in 1983 not to issue the claimant  with
   a British passport, he obtained a Dominican one, on which he later  came
   back to this country as  a  returning  resident.    The  decision  under
   appeal, which did not either on its face or in the explanatory statement
   set out the history in anything like  the  detail  it  might  have  been
   expected to do, refused him entry clearance to  return  on  that  basis,
   because on the last occasion when he had been to this country 20 October
   1997 he was given leave to enter for a visit of up to 6 months,  and  he
   had since been away from this country for more than  two  years.    Both
   those facts are agreed by the claimant.

4. So far as being away for more than two years is concerned, that  is  the
   consideration referred to in � 18(2) of the Immigration Rules, which  is
   subject to the discretionary exception mentioned in � 19.  It  was  that
   discretionary  exception  which  took  up  most  of  the   adjudicator's
   decision. However, on the claimant's last stay in this  country  he  had
   only limited leave to enter, referred to � 18(1), which is  not  subject
   to the exception in paragraph 19, which reads:

   A person who does not benefit from the  preceding  paragraph  by  reason
   only of having been away from the United Kingdom too long ...

5. It follows that the adjudicator was clearly wrong to  allow  the  appeal
   under the rules on the basis  that  the  claimant  was  qualified  as  a
   returning resident.  That is very far from the  end  of  the  story,  or
   indeed the real point in this case. That, as we have said, is whether he
   was before and is now entitled to a  full  British  passport.   That  is
   something he has himself sensibly pursued with the Home Office,  and  we
   have their reply of  14  September  2004,  confirming  that  he  may  be
   eligible for one.  We also have Mrs Poulter's assurance that no  further
   action will be taken against him until that question is resolved.

6. It follows that although the Home Office appeal is allowed, the claimant
   may reasonably expect to remain in this country while  the  question  of
   his right to British citizenship is resolved.
