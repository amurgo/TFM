For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Islam, Immigration Aid, Luton


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Entry Clearance Officer appeals in the case of  Mrs  Sayada  Sarmin
    Begum, OA/02672/2013, against the determination  of  Immigration  Judge
    Cohen promulgated on 17 April 2014 in which he allowed  the  appeal  of
    Mrs Begum against the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  at  the
    British High Commission in Dhaka which was  made  on  2  December  2012
    refusing to grant Mrs Begum  entry  clearance  as  the  spouse  of  her
    husband who is settled in the United  Kingdom.   For  the  purposes  of
    continuity I shall refer to Mrs Begum as the appellant as  she  was  in
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The application made by Mrs Begum, the appellant, depended entirely  on
    her establishing that her  husband,  the  sponsor,  met  the  financial
    requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  they  then  stood.   That
    required the sponsor to produce evidence of a gross income of at  least
    �18,600 per annum.  The sponsor was not  able  to  establish  that  the
    earnings as a chef at Buckingham Tandoori for which he was paid �10,399
    per annum were adequate.  Consequently  he  began  working  as  a  shop
    assistant with a company called Prithinir Ltd and he had  been  working
    there since  6  May  2012  earning  �9,100  per  annum.   He  made  his
    application on 5 September 2012, that is less than six months after  he
    commenced work at Prithinir Ltd.  It would have been  open  to  him  to
    have waited until 6 November 2012 in order to rely  upon  his  earnings
    from Prithinir Ltd.

 3. The requirements of the Immigration Rules are that the sponsor  had  to
    provide to the appellant wage slips covering

         (c)(i) a period of six months prior to the date of  application  if
         the applicant had been employed by their current  employer  for  at
         least six months; or

         (c)(ii) any period of salaried employment in the period  of  twelve
         months prior to the date of application if the applicant  has  been
         employed by their current employer for less than six months.

    It was therefore the  case  that  at  the  date  of  application  on  5
    September 2012 the sponsor was indeed earning at the rate of �10,399.92
    plus �9,100.  Accordingly he was earning in excess of  �19,000  at  the
    date he made his application.

 4. There were therefore two ways in which this application might be  made.
    He was not able to rely upon (i) a period of six months  prior  to  the
    date of application because he had not been employed by  Prithinir  Ltd
    for the minimum period of six months.  He could,  however  have  relied
    upon (ii) a period of salaried employment of twelve months prior to the
    date of application if the applicant had been employed by  the  current
    employer for less than six months.  However, if he were to rely  on  an
    annual income from Prithinir at the rate of �9,100  he  had  only  been
    working for five out of twelve months, so he would only be entitled  to
    add to his previous earnings something  less  than  �4,500  per  annum,
    making in total earnings of �15,500.  He did  not  therefore  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 5. The judge, however, in paragraph 9 of  his  determination  recited  the
    fact that the respondent was not satisfied that the sponsor  earned  in
    excess of �18,600 as required as this could not be shown to  have  been
    earned for the six months prior to the date of application.  The  judge
    then recited the fact as I have recited that he was able to  show  that
    he was currently earning �19,000 per annum.  He  also  found  that  the
    sponsor was a credible witness (and I have no reason to doubt that) and
    therefore he said:

         "The respondent has refused the  application  because  the  sponsor
         merely provided  financial  documentation  spanning  a  five  month
         period rather than a six month period.  The sponsor indicated  that
         payslips including for the full six  month  period  were  submitted
         together with the grounds of appeal.  I  find  the  respondent  has
         taken a prescriptive view  of  the  evidence  in  respect  of  this
         application rather than  an  enabling  view.   The  respondent  has
         applied the Immigration Rules strictly and without the  application
         of common sense or common law fairness.  I find that  the  evidence
         submitted to me in support of the sponsor's income pertains to  the
         date of application and date of  decision  and  find  that  at  all
         relevant times he has earned in excess of �18,600.  I find that the
         respondent's decision is not in accordance with the law and I allow
         the appeal under the Immigration Rules."

 6. I am satisfied that in reaching that conclusion the judge made an error
    of law.  First there is no obligation to adopt an enabling view of  the
    Immigration Rules.  They are to be construed as they stand.  It is  not
    at all clear what might be meant by the words "enabling view".  If that
    simply means that all applications will be  allowed  then  it  must  be
    wrong.   If  it  means  that  the  judge  is  entitled  to  enable  the
    Immigration Rules to apply in a case when they do not, then that,  too,
    must be wrong.  It was  accepted,  I  think,  by  the  judge  that  the
    respondent  applied  the  Immigration  Rules  strictly  as  indeed  the
    respondent was required to do.  It is wrong to say that the application
    was decided without reference to common sense or common  law  fairness.
    It was construed in accordance with what the requirements of the  Rules
    were and there could be no more sense than that.  There is no principle
    of common law fairness that permits a judge to rewrite the  Immigration
    Rules as SSHD v Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2  in  the  Court  of  Appeal
    makes clear.

 7. Accordingly the decision  made  by  the  judge  that  the  respondent's
    decision was not in accordance with the law  and  sufficient  therefore
    for him to allow the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  disclosed  an
    error of law.  That infected his further consideration because he  then
    went on to deal with the Article 8 claim and said the  application  was
    submitted in 2012 and that it had taken two years for  the  appellant's
    application to be considered and for  the  appeal  to  reach  him.   It
    cannot be unlawful on the part of the decision-maker to take two  years
    to decide an application  of  this  type  because  there  is  no  legal
    obligation on behalf of the Secretary of State or the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer to reach a decision within a specific period of time.  The time
    that it takes for an appeal to reach the First-tier Tribunal is clearly
    not a matter that one can take into account.

 8. The judge went on to say that the appellant met the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules in all respects but that is, for the reasons  that  I
    have given, incorrect.   He  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Accordingly he found that it  was  disproportionate
    to make the appellant make a further application under the  Immigration
    Rules.  That decision must itself be flawed.  If the appellant were now
    to make an application and were now  to  comply  with  the  Immigration
    Rules that would be a very good reason for making a  fresh  application
    rather than pursue this appeal on the basis that the Secretary of State
    erred in law.

 9. Finally the judge appears to have relied on the decision in MM in which
    the lawfulness of the requirement of  �18,600  was  considered  by  the
    Tribunal and held to be unlawful.   That  decision  has  recently  been
    reversed by the Court of Appeal in MM, AM & SJ v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  In  these  circumstances  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  must  be  set  aside  and  I
    remake the decision dismissing the appeal on all the grounds  advanced.
    That of course means it is open now for the appellant to make  a  fresh
    application, and if the material meets the requirements of  the  Rules,
    that application may well succeed.

DECISION

    The Judge made  an  error  on  a  point  of  law  and  I  substitute  a
    determination dismissing the appeal on all the grounds advanced.
