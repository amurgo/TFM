                                   Between

                                   Ali [M]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION BY CONSENT

    Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

         "Upon the  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Monaghan
         promulgated on 20th January 2020 disclosing a material error of law
         and being set aside on 27th May 2020.

         And upon the parties agreeing that the appeal should be remitted to
         the First-tier Tribunal, the appeal by the  appellant  against  the
         refusal of his protection  claim  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal."

    The appeal in the Upper Tribunal is allowed.  The decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error.   The  appeal  against  the
    decision giving rise to the appeal  is  remitted  to  be  heard  afresh
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

    The appellant's representative sought a decision with various  findings
    of fact retained. Given there is an error of law in  the  decision  and
    there is agreement that the decision  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, such findings are not necessary in this case. The findings of
    fact will stand in so far as the First-tier Tribunal concludes  is  the
    case, taking fully into account the acceptance  by  the  respondent  of
    various matters, the findings made by FtT Judge Monaghan after  hearing
    evidence and the basis upon which the judge erred in law.
