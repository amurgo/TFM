                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Secretary of State is the appellant before the Upper Tribunal.  For
    the sake of convenience, I shall refer to Mir  Sanjida  Iffat  as  'the
    claimant' herein.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of  Bangladesh,  born  10  March  1989.   She
    entered the United Kingdom on 16 January 2009 with leave to enter as  a
    student and was subsequently granted  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student, conferred until 10 July 2014.  On  2  May  2013  the
    claimant's leave was varied to that to leave as a Tier  1  (Post-Study)
    partner, until 23 August 2014. She sought an extension of that leave by
    way of an application made on 13 August 2014, but such application  was
    refused in a decision of the Secretary of State  made  on  26  February
    2016. It is this decision that is the subject of the underlying  appeal
    to the Tribunal.

Secretary of State's Decision

 3. The core rationale deployed by the Secretary of State for concluding in
    the decision of 26 February 2016 that the claimant's  application  must
    be refused pursuant to paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules  reads
    as follows:

         "In your Tier 4 application dated 7 September 2012, you submitted a
         TOEIC certificate from Educational Testing Service ("ETS").

         ETS has a record of your speaking test.  Using  voice  verification
         software, ETS is able to detect when a single person is undertaking
         multiple tests.  ETS undertook a check of your test  and  confirmed
         to the SSHD that there was significant evidence  to  conclude  that
         your certificate was fraudulently obtained by the use  of  a  proxy
         test taker.  Your scores from the test taken on 22 February 2012 at
         Synergy Business College of London have now been cancelled by  ETS.
         On the basis of information provided to her by  ETS,  the  SSHD  is
         satisfied that your certificate was fraudulently obtained and  that
         you used deception in your application of 7 September 2012.

         In  fraudulently  obtaining  a  TOEIC  certificate  in  the  manner
         outlined above, you willingly participated in what was  clearly  an
         organised and serious attempt, given the  complicity  of  the  test
         centre itself, to defraud the SSHD and others.  In  doing  so,  you
         displayed a flagrant disregard for the public  interest,  according
         to which migrants are required to have a certain level  of  English
         language ability in order  to  facilitate  social  integration  and
         cohesion, as well as to reduce  the  likelihood  of  them  being  a
         burden on the tax payer.

         Accordingly, I am satisfied that your presence in  the  UK  is  not
         conducive  to  the  public  good  because  your  conduct  makes  it
         undesirable to allow you to remain in the United Kingdom."

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The claimant appealed this decision to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
    appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge R. Scott on  4  July  2017
    and was allowed "under the Immigration Rules" in a decision promulgated
    on 21 July 2017.

 5. At the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  claimant  gave
    evidence of the English language examinations she had undertaken in the
    past and further confirmed that she had personally  taken  the  English
    language test on 22 February 2012.  In relation to the events on day of
    the test itself the claimant evidence was summarised by the  First-tier
    Tribunal in the following terms:

         "29. She took the English test in person at  the  ETS  centre  near
             Cross Harbour.  It was a long  building  about  five  minutes'
             walk from the station.  She chose it online as  the  date  was
             suitable for her.  She went there three times,  once  to  book
             the test and then on two separate days for each  part  of  the
             exam.  She could not remember exactly what happened  when  she
             entered the building as it was a long time ago.  However,  she
             explained that she got there early, went through the  security
             gate, someone checked her identification and told her where to
             go.  There were about 25 to 30 people there.  There were a few
             invigilators, but she could not remember exactly how many.

         30.  There were two different exams on two  different  dates.   One
             was speaking and writing, the other was listening and reading.
              As regards the speaking  and  reading  test,  she  could  not
             remember what came first.  The candidates had to listen  to  a
             recording.  She had to find the answers from the voices on the
             tape - there were different choices saying  different  things.
             The questions were multiple choice.  She  could  not  remember
             the topic of the tape recordings but knew that they  described
             different situations.  She could not remember the detail as it
             was five years ago.  As regards the speaking and writing,  she
             thought  the  speaking  test  was  about   pronunciation   and
             vocabulary and in the writing test she thought she had written
             an essay.  However she said that she was not a little confused
             as to which elements were in the TOEIC test and which were  in
             her IELTS test in 2008.

         31.  She described the setup of the exam room, there was  a  little
             desk with a computer in front of her.  She had  more  students
             in front of her.  Invigilators came and told them what to  do.
             They had to wear headphones.  There were not the  same  number
             of people on both days of testing.  There were fewer people at
             the speaking test than at the listing test.  The listing  test
             was less than one hour.  The longest test was the reading test
             - she felt that it had taken a long time.  The  speaking  test
             was about half an hour.  The reading test  involved  different
             comprehensions and the candidates had to find the right  words
             from it and answer multiple choice questions."

 6. In support of her case before the First-tier Tribunal, the Secretary of
    State relied upon statements from Rebecca Collings and Peter Millington
    as well as a report from  a  Professor  French,  none  of  which  refer
    specifically to the claimant.  Reliance was also placed  on  a  witness
    statement authored  by  Hilary  Rackstraw  which  whilst  substantially
    generic in the evidence also purported to  refer  specifically  to  the
    claimant's circumstances - incorrectly stating that  the  claimant  was
    one of many individuals in respect of whom indefinite leave  to  remain
    was refused by the Home Office. In fact, the claimant has never applied
    for or been refused ILR.

 7. The Secretary of State further relied upon the contents of  a  'look-up
    tool'  which  identified  that  (i)  the  claimant's  test  result  was
    classified as invalid by ETS, (ii) 68% of  the  results  of  the  tests
    taken at Synergy Business College on 22 February 2012  were  classified
    as 'invalid' and (iii) that the other 32% of test results for that date
    were classified as being 'questionable'.

 8. Finally, the Secretary of State relied upon  a  Project  Faï¿½ade  report
    into Synergy Business College which, inter alia, stated that between 24
    November 2011 and 15 January 2013 Synergy  Business  College  undertook
    4,894 TOEIC tests of which 49% have been identified as invalid and  the
    rest as questionable.

 9. Having summarised accurately the above evidence and  properly  directed
    itself to the relevant case law, the First-tier Tribunal  set  out  its
    conclusions in paragraphs 42 to 50 of its decision.   At  paragraph  42
    the Tribunal observe that the claimant had obtained  A  grades  in  her
    English examinations in 2004 and 2006 and passed an IELTS English  test
    in 2008. It correctly directed itself thereafter, that neither of these
    matters "are evidence of English ability at the date of  the  ETS  test
    [in 2012]".  The same point is made at paragraph 43  regarding  of  the
    claimant's ability to speak  English  without  an  interpreter  at  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.

10. In paragraph 44 of its decision the First-tier  Tribunal  observe  that
    even if the claimant had been fluent in English  at  the  date  of  the
    disputed TOIEC (ETS) test there may have been other reasons why she did
    not wish to take the test at that time e.g. a lack of time  to  prepare
    for the test, a lack of confidence or a need for  a  fast  result.  The
    Tribunal continues, at paragraph 45, by stating:

         "None of these possible motivations, or any others were however put
         to the appellant by the respondent.  The only challenge to her  was
         that she could not remember sufficient detail about  attending  and
         taking the test to support her claim that she had in fact taken  it
         herself."

11.  The  central  thrust  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning   and
    conclusions is to be found in paragraph 48 onwards of its decision:

         "48. I find that she performed well under  cross-examination  about
             sitting the test.  This is notable because her  statement  did
             not canvass in any way the circumstances of  her  sitting  the
             test, such as how she got there or what  happened  during  the
             test.  Her statement was only her denial of  the  allegations,
             her explanation of her English fluency and her assertion  that
             she would not cheat.  This would  suggest  that  she  had  not
             necessarily recently contemplated the circumstances of sitting
             the test.  If she were lying about having sat  the  test,  she
             would therefore have had to "make it up as  she  went  along."
             However, during  cross-examination  about  the  test  she  did
             appear to be  recalling  events  from  her  memory  with  more
             information and detail coming  to  her  as  she  went  through
             events in her head, and this appeared to me to be genuine  not
             "making it up as she went along", but natural and unrehearsed.
              She could not remember all the details she was  asked  about,
             and she said that she was getting confused between the  detail
             of events at the ETS test and the IELTS 2008 test.  However, I
             consider that this did not undermine  her  evidence,  but  was
             plausible, and consistent with her genuine attempt  to  recall
             events which took place about five years ago.   The  appellant
             nevertheless provided a reasonably detailed account  above  of
             why she chose that test centre, how and when she  went  there,
             and what happened during the test.   I  found  her  to  be  an
             honest witness.

         49.   I  have  found  above  that  the  respondent's  evidence   is
             sufficient to raise the  issue  of  deception  in  this  case.
             However, I also consider that the appellant  has  provided  an
             innocent explanation that she took the test herself.   I  have
             found that she was a credible witness  and  that  she  gave  a
             plausible, innocent account of sitting the test, and that this
             was enough to suggest that she did in fact attend and sit  the
             test herself.  The  appellant  has  therefore  discharged  the
             evidential burden on her.

         50.  I find the reasons above that the respondent has not  rebutted
             the  appellant's  plausible  explanation.   Accordingly,   the
             respondent  has  not  proved  her  allegations   against   the
             appellant to  the  required  standard.   She  has  not  proved
             deception on the appellant's part and the  appellant's  appeal
             therefore succeeds."

Grounds of Challenge

12. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal focus was laid by Mr Duffy  on
    the assertion that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in  failing  to
    provide adequate reasons for accepting the claimant's evidence that she
    had taken the TOEIC (ETS) examination on  22  February  2012.   It  was
    further particularly asserted that the First-tier Tribunal had erred:

      i) In taking into account the claimant's  English  language  abilities
         and other qualifications;

     ii) In failing to have regard to the fact that a person who is able  to
         speak English may well have other reasons for using a proxy to take
         an English language test; and,

    iii) In failing to view a DVD of the BBC Panorama  programme  which,  it
         was said, showed students (not at the claimant's college)  standing
         next to terminals whilst proxy test takers  took  English  language
         tests for them - such DVD having been provided by the Secretary  of
         State to every immigration hearing centre.

13. Taking these in turn, in my conclusion the First-tier Tribunal did  not
    err  in  its  approach  to  the  fact  that  the  claimant  had  passed
    examinations in English in 2004 to 2008. The Tribunal was at  pains  to
    remind itself that such matters were not of particular  relevance  (see
    paragraph 42). The First-tier Tribunal also  properly  directed  itself
    that there may be reasons why an applicant would wish to  use  a  proxy
    test taker even if they had the  required  level  of  English  language
    abilities (see paragraphs 42 to 44).

14. As to the alleged failure of the First-tier Tribunal to view the DVD of
    the BBC Panorama programme which was, it is said, sent  to  all  First-
    tier Tribunal hearing centres, this ground is  hopeless.  There  is  no
    evidence before me that the First-tier Tribunal judge was asked to view
    this DVD. It is not sufficient for the Secretary of State to  send  one
    DVD to each hearing centre when there are  many  thousands  of  appeals
    relating to this same issue and expect the Tribunal itself to determine
    whether it needs to view the  DVD  in  any  particular  case.   If  the
    Secretary of State wants to rely upon evidence at a hearing before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  she  should,  at  the  very  least,  notify   the
    particular appellant of the intention to rely on such evidence, provide
    a copy of the DVD to the appellant on good time for  the  hearing,  and
    provide a copy of the DVD to the Tribunal in each case. In the  instant
    case, the aforementioned steps not having been taken, it was still open
    to the Presenting Officer to seek an adjournment  on  the  day  of  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal to enable the production of such
    evidence. No such application was made. Indeed, there is no  record  of
    the DVD even being mentioned  at  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. In my view it is an entirely inadequate (and some might go as
    far as saying abusive) for the Secretary of State to send a copy  of  a
    DVD to a hearing centre, fail to specify prior to the hearing that  she
    intends to place reliance on such DVD in the particular appeal, fail to
    mention the DVD at the hearing the appeal and then subsequently to seek
    to rely upon the First-tier Tribunal's failure to view  the  DVD  as  a
    ground of appeal when the decision of the Tribunal goes against her.

15. Turning finally to  the  overarching  submission  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal failed to provide  adequate  reasons  for  its  conclusion,  I
    disagree. The Tribunal correctly directed itself in law,  took  account
    of all material  matters,  did  not  attach  excessive  weight  to  any
    particular piece of evidence and considered all of the evidence in  the
    round. With respect, it is difficult to see what  further  reasons  the
    First-tier Tribunal could have deployed in light of the  evidence  made
    available  to  it.  Ultimately,  the  Tribunal  was  impressed  by  the
    claimant's evidence and in particular the evidence as the  events  that
    took place on the day of the test. The First-tier Tribunal was,  in  my
    view, entitled to come to the conclusion it did  in  relation  to  such
    evidence.

16. In short, I find that the First-tier Tribunal reached a conclusion that
    was open to it on the evidence - albeit a generous one -  having  taken
    into account all material matters and not having taken account  of  any
    matters which were immaterial to its considerations.

17. Consequently, I find that the First-tier Tribunal's decision  does  not
    contain an error of law and it is to remain standing.
