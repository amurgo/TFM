                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal brought by the respondent. However, for convenience I
    will continue to refer to the  parties  hereinafter  as  they  appeared
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The respondent appeals against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Howard  ('the  Judge')  issued  on  3  July  2019  by  which  the
    appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to revoke his
    refugee status and replace it with discretionary leave  to  remain  was
    allowed.

 3. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Buchanan  granted  permission  on  all
    grounds.



Anonymity

 4. The Judge did not issue an anonymity order.  This is a matter in  which
    the appellant has previously  been  recognised  as  a  refugee.   I  am
    mindful of Guidance Note 2013 No 1 concerned with anonymity orders  and
    I observe that the starting point for consideration of anonymity orders
    in this chamber of the Upper Tribunal as in all courts and Tribunals is
    open justice.  However, I note paragraph 13 of the Guidance Note  where
    it is confirmed that it is the present practice of both the  First-tier
    Tribunal and this Tribunal that an  anonymity  order  is  made  in  all
    appeals raising asylum or other  international  protection  claims.  An
    appeal concerned with a revocation of refugee status falls  within  the
    scope of this Practice.

 5. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order:

         Unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise,  no  report
         of these  proceedings  or  any  formal  publication  thereof  shall
         directly or indirectly  identify  the  appellant.   This  direction
         applies to, amongst others, the appellant and the respondent.   Any
         failure to comply with this direction could give rise  to  contempt
         of court proceedings.  I do so in order to avoid the likelihood  of
         serious harm arising to the  appellant  from  the  content  of  his
         protection claim.



Background

 6. The appellant is a national of the People's Republic of  China  and  is
    presently aged 35.  He entered this country in 2003 as  a  student  and
    enjoyed leave to remain for several years before unsuccessfully seeking
    to vary leave.  He was recognised by the respondent  to  be  a  refugee
    within the meaning of the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of  Refugees
    on 15 October 2015 and granted leave to remain in this country until 11
    January 2021.  He was convicted  at  Basildon  Crown  Court  of  having
    between 1 June 2014  and  21  May  2015  fraudulently  evaded  duty  in
    relation to the importation of tobacco  under  Section  170(2)  of  the
    Customs and Excise Management  Act  1979.   On  16  June  2017  he  was
    sentenced by HHJ Pugh to a term of three years' imprisonment.   In  his
    sentencing remarks the sentencing judge observed:

         "... you were convicted by the jury for being involved in smuggling
         large quantities of tobacco into this country.  You  were  involved
         in arranging for the shipping containers to be delivered to storage
         sites and thereafter you were involved in the delivery of boxes  of
         tobacco to customers in the United Kingdom.  I  am  satisfied  that
         this was an  operation  which  involved  significant  planning  and
         accordingly falls within a high culpability.  The value of the duty
         evaded was ï¿½9.8 million, just over."

 7. The respondent issued a decision  to  revoke  the  appellant's  refugee
    status on 13 November 2018 replacing it with discretionary leave extant
    to 11 January 2021 hereinbefore the FTT.

 8. The appeal came before the Judge at Harmondsworth on 11 April 2019.  By
    way of his decision of  3  July  2019  the  Judge  concluded  that  the
    respondent  had  failed  to  establish  that  the  appellant  currently
    constitutes a danger to the community and  so  the  appellant  was  not
    excluded from international protection under the 1951 UN Convention.



Grounds of Appeal

 9. By means of the respondent's grounds complaint is made that  the  Judge
    failed to give any clear reasons for his finding that "I  can  conceive
    of no circumstances in which he is  likely  to  offend  again"  as  the
    offence was committed for financial gain.   In  relation  to  the  same
    issue the respondent observed that there was  no  indication  that  the
    appellant  had  taken  awareness  courses  to  address  the   risk   of
    reoffending, and therefore "would again become  involved  in  smuggling
    activities for financial gain". The respondent further  complains  that
    as the OASys Report was largely completed by the  appellant  it  should
    carry little weight.  It is further observed in the  grounds  that  the
    appellant had denied the offence that this appears to fail to  consider
    the evidence of the offender manager that the appellant recognised  the
    consequences of his offending on others.

10. In granting permission,  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Buchanan
    primarily focused on the failure of the Judge to provide clear  reasons
    as to why he could conceive of no circumstances in which the  appellant
    was likely to offend again, though permission to appeal was granted  on
    all grounds.

11. A Rule 24 response was filed by the applicant on  the  morning  of  the
    hearing.



The Hearing

12. Mr Bramble very fairly indicated that he had been able to consider  the
    Rule  24  response  handed  to  him  by  Mr  Georget  just  before  the
    commencement of the hearing, and whilst continuing  to  rely  upon  the
    grounds of  appeal  advanced  by  the  respondent  he  had  no  further
    submissions to make.  In response, Mr Georget relied upon the  contents
    of the Rule 24 response that he had drafted.





Decision on Error of Law

13. The decision which underpins this appeal is that made by the respondent
    on 13 November 2018 headed "Decision to Revoke Refugee Status". Therein
    the respondent concluded:

      i) that the appellant has been convicted  of  a  particularly  serious
         crime;

     ii) that he is a danger to the community; and consequently

    iii) that his refugee status was to be  revoked  pursuant  to  paragraph
         339AC(2) of the Immigration Rules.

14. The respondent confirmed  that  she  was  not  seeking  to  pursue  the
    appellant's deportation at the present time and by way  of  a  separate
    decision granted the appellant  discretionary  leave  to  remain.   The
    revocation  therefore  denied  the  appellant   the   protection   from
    refoulement and attendant benefits flowing from his  recognition  as  a
    refugee.

15. The Judge's findings and decision are identified at [19] to [22] of the
    decision:

         "19.     The report by his offending  manager  is  dated  22  March
             2019.  In that report she notes, 'Following his  release  from
             custody it was clear that the period incarceration (sic) had a
             profound effect upon [the  appellant].  He  described  feeling
             anxious resulting in difficulty sleeping and  showing  remorse
             for his involvement in this matter.  He  presents  as  adamant
             that he will not offend in the future and regrets  the  impact
             of this offence on his wife and  in  particular  the  time  he
             missed  with  his  young  daughter.   As  stated  above   [the
             appellant] has expressed  interest  in  undertaking  voluntary
             work in order to pay back to society despite the fact  he  has
             already served a custodial sentence for this offence.'

         20.      In addition to the above [the appellant] is now in gainful
             employment.  I have been provided with copies  of  his  recent
             payslips and P60.  This is important as  in  his  evidence  he
             identified his principal motivator in offending his  inability
             to work lawfully and his perceived need  to  provide  for  his
             partner.

         21.      The offending in which  he  was  convicted  is  clearly  a
             'particularly serious crime',  by  virtue  of  the  amount  of
             revenue of which it deprived the Exchequer.  However, it  must
             also be shown that he constitutes a danger to the community of
             the UK.  There is a danger explicit in what he undertook.  The
             tobacco industry is regulated in part to ensure the quality of
             the products being  sold  on  the  market  in  the  UK.   That
             tobacco, in its consumption, is inherently dangerous cannot be
             the  danger  he  constitutes,  it  is  however  the  potential
             additional  danger  presented  by  introducing  products   the
             provenance of  which  is  unknown  that  creates  the  danger.
             However, the products imported by the  appellant  were  finite
             and what I am being asked to consider is whether the appellant
             constitutes a danger.  He is not violent and the  only  danger
             it could be concluded he poses is by the repetition of similar
             offending.  I can conceive of no circumstances in which he  is
             likely to reoffend.

         22.      In the circumstances of the evidence which is  before  me,
             whilst I find  that  the  'index'  offences  can  properly  be
             described as particularly serious offences, I  find  that  the
             respondent  has  failed  to  establish  that   the   appellant
             currently constitutes a danger to the community of the  United
             Kingdom, the  burden  of  proving  otherwise  lying  upon  the
             respondent.    That   burden   has   not   been    discharged.
             Consequently, I conclude that the appellant  is  not  excluded
             from Refugee Convention protection with reference  to  section
             72 of the 2002 Act."

16. After having considered the submissions made by both  parties,  I  have
    concluded that the First-tier Tribunal decision,  although  concise  in
    nature, did not involve the making of an error of law that  would  have
    made any material difference to the outcome  of  the  appeal.   At  its
    heart, the respondent's criticisms are simply disagreements as  to  the
    findings of fact made.

17. The respondent's primary challenge is to the Judge's lack of  reasoning
    when asserting that he could conceive of no circumstances in which  the
    appellant is likely to offend again. I am in agreement with Mr  Georget
    that this finding must be read in the context of what proceeds  it  and
    not in isolation.  Approaching it fairly and as a whole,  the  decision
    makes sufficient sense that the  parties  can  understand  the  Judge's
    reasoning.  The Judge expressly considered the  favourable  opinion  of
    the offender manager who not only has considerable experience as to the
    likely risk of further offending, but had also supervised the appellant
    over a period of time and was satisfied that when applying the  correct
    test the appellant was not a danger to the community.  Whilst the words
    "no circumstances"  are  used,  I  agree  with  Mr  Georget  that  this
    overstatement is not material in  the  circumstances  when  taking  the
    Judge's reasoning as a whole into consideration.

18. The Judge was entitled to rely upon the OASys report provided which was
    accompanied by a report authored by the appellant's  offender  manager.
    Consideration of the OASys report does  not  sustain  the  respondent's
    allegation that it was written largely by the appellant.  OASys  is  an
    offender assessment tool used by both the prison and probation services
    to undertake risk in these assessments.  The assessment includes a self-
    assessment  questionnaire,  but  these  are  subject  to   professional
    scrutiny and assessments are often bolstered through the use of one  or
    several interviews over time.  Their widespread  use  by  organisations
    required to consider  risk  by  those  who  have  criminal  convictions
    underscores  their  reliability.   This  aspect  of  the   respondent's
    challenge lacks focus, lacks particularity and has no merit.

19. In all of the circumstances the Judge lawfully  considered  the  issues
    arising before him, gave lawful reasons and made no material  error  of
    law.

Notice of Decision

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law, the decision therefore stands.

21. I am very grateful for those helping to transcribe this decision.

22. No fee was paid or is payable and therefore there can be no fee award.
