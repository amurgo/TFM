Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Pettersen, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs A Javid, Solicitor on behalf of Reiss Solicitors



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing MA's appeal against the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse his application for  leave  to  enter
    the United Kingdom to join  his  spouse  and  Sponsor,  NS,  a  British
    citizen.  For the purposes of this  decision,  I  shall  refer  to  the
    Secretary  of  State  as  the  Respondent  and  MA  as  the  Appellant,
    reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 2. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  Appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him or any member of their family.  This  direction
    applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt  of  court  proceedings.   I
    have made such a direction as the evidence before the  Tribunal  refers
    to medical evidence in respect of a minor and also a party.

 3. The Appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.  On  25th
    February 2013 he applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom to  join
    his spouse and Sponsor, NS, who is a British citizen.  That application
    was refused by the Respondent on 22nd May 2013.

 4. The reasons for refusing that application were  two-fold;  namely  that
    the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the  Appellant  met
    the relationship and the financial requirement of Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules and, in particular, paragraphs E-EC-P.1.1(d)  and  E-
    ECP.3.1 thereof.  The reasons were also given in the refusal letter  of
    the same date.  In respect of their relationship, it  was  stated  that
    the Appellant had not indicated when the relationship first  began  and
    there was no evidence to substantiate the claim that  the  couple  last
    saw one another on 22nd June 2012.  It was asserted  there  was  little
    evidence of contact which amounted to a single remittance  slip  and  a
    number of photographs dating back to 2010.  Thus the  first  issue  was
    that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not   satisfied   that   the
    relationship was genuine and subsisting or, that the couple intended to
    live together permanently.

 5.   The second reason for refusing the application was in respect of  the
    financial requirements.  It was asserted that  the  documents  provided
    did not clearly confirm the Sponsor's gross income  for  the  last  six
    months.  The evidence of employment was considered  and  it  was  noted
    that  there  was  no  evidence  indicating  salary  payments  into  the
    Sponsor's account.  Thus the application was refused.

 6. The Appellant exercised his right to appeal that decision and  on  25th
    September  2013  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  reviewed  the  further
    evidence but maintained her decision.

 7. The Appellant's appeal was heard before the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    Bagral) on 2nd April 2014 at Bradford.  The judge had the advantage  of
    hearing oral evidence from the Sponsor and also a witness in  the  form
    of her employer, Mr T.  It is plain from reading the  determination  at
    [11] that the judge found their evidence  to  be  frank,  truthful  and
    credible and was in accordance with the documentary evidence  that  had
    been placed before the judge.

 8.   First of all, the judge dealt with the issue of  whether  the  couple
    were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  As set out above it  is
    plain that the  judge  formed  a  more  than  favourable  view  of  the
    Sponsor's evidence and whilst the relationship had been  challenged  by
    the Entry Clearance Officer in the refusal letter and that  had  formed
    part of basis the  refusal,  it  is  further  plain  from  reading  the
    determination at [12] that the Presenting Officer at  the  hearing  did
    not challenge the evidence provided in  support  of  the  relationship.
    The judge found the Sponsor's evidence as to the relationship "entirely
    genuine" (at [12]) and found on the evidence before her that  they  had
    maintained contact via various methods  such  as  telephone,  Facebook,
    Skype and texts and that there were photographs of  the  couple  and  a
    single post-marriage visit.

 9.  The judge also placed weight and importance upon the fact that a child
    was born of the parties on 5th March 2013.  The decision in  this  case
    was 22nd May 2013, two months  after  the  birth  of  the  child.   The
    Appellant provided evidence before the Entry  Clearance  Officer  which
    was referred to in the ECM review on 29th September 2013 in the form of
    a birth certificate.  However the Entry  Clearance  Manager  considered
    that this was not evidence of a  subsisting  relationship  between  the
    father and mother.  However this was not maintained before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and the judge found at [12] and  [13]  that  this  was  a
    genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  and  therefore  had   met   the
    relationship requirements under Appendix FM.

10. Dealing with the financial requirements, the reasons given by the Entry
    Clearance Officer for refusing the application was set out by the judge
    at  [2].   The  judge  dealt  with  the  issues  at  [14]-[18]  of  the
    determination.  Despite the matters set out in the refusal letter there
    appeared to be little in dispute between the  parties  at  the  hearing
    itself.  It was accepted by the Presenting Officer that  the  Appellant
    was in employment at the time of the date  of  decision  and  that  the
    gross pay  was  ï¿½18,600  and  the  judge  recorded  at  [18]  that  the
    Presenting Officer accepted that.  It was  further  accepted  that  the
    relevant documents to support the financial requirements (in  the  form
    of bank statements  for  the  six  month  period  demonstrating  salary
    payments) had been provided (at [17]).  The judge refused, in  my  view
    properly, the Presenting Officer's submission relating to the  date  of
    the Appellant's employment at [17].  Thus the  only  issue  outstanding
    and identified by the parties was whether the  Appellant  had  complied
    with the requirement to produce an employer's letter.  The  Appellant's
    representative did not dispute the letter from  the  employer  had  not
    been provided and the judge  did  not  accept  the  argument  that  the
    accountant's letter was sufficient to satisfy  the  requirement  for  a
    specified document. Thus she found that the Appellant  could  not  meet
    the Immigration Rules for that reason.  In this context it is important
    to note that the judge had the opportunity to hear the oral evidence of
    a witness, Mr T, who is the Sponsor's employer.  At [11] the judge made
    a finding that his evidence was truthful, frank and credible  and  that
    he was her employer and that instead of the letter being produced,  the
    judge had the advantage of hearing the oral evidence  of  the  employer
    which the judge accepted and it was this that formed  the  findings  in
    due course at [21].

11. The judge then moved on to Article 8 applying the guidance  in  Gulshan
    [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) and at paragraphs [20]-[21] the judge reached the
    conclusion that there were good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain
    outside the Immigration Rules placing weight upon medical  evidence  in
    respect of the newborn British child and that of the mother,  that  the
    income threshold was met and that the  legitimate  purpose  behind  the
    Rules to ensure that the applicant did  not  have  recourse  to  public
    funds had been met in this case (in the light of the evidence from  the
    witness).  The judge considered that "notwithstanding the very  weighty
    interest  of  the  Respondent",  the  judge  found  on  the  issue   of
    proportionality that the decision of the Respondent was  not  justified
    on the particular facts of the case.  Thus she allowed  the  appeal  on
    human rights grounds (Article 8).

12. The Respondent sought permission to appeal that decision to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The grounds are set out in the application.   Those  grounds
    submit that the judge failed to identify the  compelling  circumstances
    that were not recognised by the Immigration Rules  and  had  failed  to
    follow the approach of Gulshan (as cited) and R (Nagre) v  SSHD  [2013]
    EWHC 720 (Admin).  It was further asserted that the judge did not  give
    adequate reasons for allowing the appeal under Article 8  and  that  it
    had not been  considered  that  the  Appellant  could  make  a  further
    application and that the judge failed to demonstrate  how  the  refusal
    would lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome.

13. Permission to appeal was granted on 21st May  2014.   Thus  the  appeal
    came before the Upper Tribunal.  Ms Pettersen appeared on behalf of the
    Secretary of State and Mrs Javid, who appeared at the  court  below  on
    behalf of the Appellant.  Ms Pettersen relied upon the grounds set  out
    in the papers noting that the judge had dismissed the appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules because the Appellant had not produced an  employer's
    letter.  That  was  a  specified  document.   She  submitted  in  those
    circumstances it was not open to the judge to allow  the  appeal  under
    Article 8 as the judge had not provided adequate  reasons  for  finding
    that there would be unjustifiably harsh circumstances on the  facts  of
    the case.  She submitted that in terms of Article 8, the decision would
    have no affect on the child and it would maintain the status quo.   The
    judge failed  also  to  deal  with  the  remedy  of  making  a  further
    application and was swayed  by  postdecision  evidence  concerning  the
    birth.  Thus it was submitted the judge made an error of law.

14. Mrs Javid submitted that the grounds  did  not  demonstrate  any  legal
    error on the part of the judge and  that  she  had  correctly  directed
    herself on the law and the findings of facts made were open to  her  on
    the evidence.  In particular, there was medical  evidence  relating  to
    the child's birth which was not post-decision but which was before  the
    date of decision.  Any discussion of that evidence was relevant to  the
    issues.  Furthermore the Sponsor described her own medical problems  at
    the time of the birth of  the  child.   The  judge  took  all  of  that
    evidence into account and having heard the oral evidence of the Sponsor
    and also the witness allowed the appeal on Article  8  grounds.   There
    was no error of law in her approach and it was submitted on  behalf  of
    the Appellant that the judge had identified compelling circumstances in
    the case.  Thus she invited me to uphold the decision.



Conclusions:

15. I have had the opportunity of hearing the submissions  of  the  parties
    and also reading the determination in the light of  the  evidence  that
    was before the First-tier Tribunal.  Having done so, I have reached the
    conclusion that the Secretary of State has not  made  out  her  grounds
    that the decision of the judge demonstrated that she erred  in  law.  I
    shall set out my reasons for reaching that view.

16.   The grounds submit that the judge, having found  that  the  Appellant
    did not meet the Immigration Rules wrongly went on to consider  Article
    8 outside of the Rules and failed to properly  apply  the  decision  of
    Gulshan (as cited) and that  the  appeal  should  only  be  allowed  if
    exceptional  circumstances  were  found   that   would   lead   to   an
    unjustifiably harsh  outcome  (see  Grounds  1-10  relied  upon  by  Ms
    Pettersen).  In this case it is also asserted that no adequate  reasons
    were given for reaching the view that it would be  unjustifiably  harsh
    to refuse the application (see Ground 12).  It is further contended  on
    behalf of the Respondent that the Secretary of State had set a  minimum
    income threshold for those who chose to establish their family life  in
    the UK (see grounds at [8]).

17. When reading the determination as a whole it is plain  that  the  judge
    properly applied the law.  The judge at [19] set out  the  decision  of
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT 64 (IAC) and had express regard to paragraph  24(b)
    of that decision in which it is said:-

         "(b) After applying the requirements of the Rules,  only  if  there
             may arguably be good grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
             outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to  go  on
             to consider whether there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
             sufficiently recognised under them: Nagre."

18. The relevant case law makes it clear that the Immigration Rules  should
    be the starting point in any consideration of the issue of  the  rights
    of the Appellant under Article 8 of  the  ECHR.   Thus  the  judge  was
    required to consider whether there were any  "arguably  good  grounds".
    It is plain to me that the judge did carry out  that  consideration  at
    [20] and did so in the context of the evidence before her.   The  judge
    identified  two  relevant  considerations  that  were  capable  on  the
    evidence of constituting "arguably good grounds" to consider the  claim
    outside the Rules by conducting a second  stage  Article  8  assessment
    addressing the well-established Razgar matters.  Whilst the judge  made
    reference to the judge not identifying the "arguably good grounds"  the
    judge, in fact did so at  [20].   At  the  date  of  the  decision  the
    Appellant had a newborn British son  with  medical  difficulties.   The
    judge relied upon this at [20].  There was no challenge to the evidence
    in this regard and that was a finding wholly open to the judge to  make
    on the evidence before her.

19.  The child of the parties had been born on 5th March 2013,  two  months
    prior to the decision.  The Respondent was plainly aware of  the  birth
    of the child as the birth certificate had been sent as evidence of  the
    genuineness and subsistence of the relationship.  The  Entry  Clearance
    Manager, notwithstanding this important  piece  of  evidence,  did  not
    consider that it demonstrated  a  genuine  or  subsisting  relationship
    between the parties.  The evidence confirming  the  child's  birth  was
    also before the judge.  It was plainly not  post-decision  evidence  as
    submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State,  in  the  light  of  the
    child's birth which took place prior to the decision.  Any reference to
    the medical evidence post-decision was relevant and appertained to  the
    facts at the date of the decision.  The medical evidence  was  set  out
    within the bundle.  It is plain from reading the medical  evidence  the
    birth of the child was traumatic.  The  child  was  born  by  emergency
    caesarean section and the Sponsor suffered a haemorrhage which required
    further  emergency  surgery.   The  medical  evidence  sets   out   her
    circumstances which continued for a time  after  the  birth;  she  gave
    birth on 5th March but was not  discharged  from  hospital  until  18th
    March 2013 (see page 33).  The evidence of the Sponsor is  set  out  in
    her witness statement at page 52 which was to the effect that this  had
    been a very complicated pregnancy and birth.  This is  amply  reflected
    in the documentary evidence at page 39, a letter from the hospital  and
    at 47 a letter from her doctor.  There is no doubt  that  this  was  an
    extremely traumatic experience for the Sponsor in  the  light  of  that
    evidence.

20.  As  to  her  son's  birth,  he  was  born  with  a  significant  renal
    abnormality.  Following the birth he was transferred from Keighley, the
    local hospital, to Leeds for further treatment and assessment.  He  was
    diagnosed as having a bilateral grade  5  vesico-ureteric  reflux  with
    associated hydronephrosis and neurogenic bladder.  He later returned to
    hospital in the local  area  and  it  was  recorded  that  the  medical
    requirements were such that he required careful review including  blood
    checks on a  fortnightly  basis,  repeated  ultrasound  scans  and  was
    further to be reviewed by a specialist consultant at the main  hospital
    with direct access to the paediatric  unit  out  of  usual  hours.   At
    thirteen weeks the evidence was set out at page 47.   The  evidence,  I
    find was relevant to the circumstances of the child and  could  not  be
    properly  described  as   post-decision   evidence.    That   confirmed
    congenital  hydronephrosis,  neuropathic  bladder  and   vesicoureteric
    reflux.  It set out that he was  attending  hospital  and  tests  on  a
    weekly basis.  It recorded the evidence in relation to the  child  that
    it would then be of benefit to both the mother and child  to  have  her
    husband in the United Kingdom.

21. There is therefore no merit in  the  ground  that  the  judge  did  not
    identify any arguably good grounds for going on  to  conduct  a  second
    stage Article 8 assessment.  The judge plainly gave reasons which  were
    supported by the evidence.  In this respect the judge  paid  regard  to
    the findings made in the earlier parts of the determination relating to
    the genuineness of the relationship and  that  this  was  a  subsisting
    relationship.  As I have set out it is of relevance that  much  of  the
    refusal was based on the view that there was insufficient  evidence  of
    the relationship as one that was genuine  and  subsisting.   The  judge
    reached a contrary view after having the advantage of  considering  not
    only the documentary evidence but also hearing the oral evidence of the
    parties.  The judge also considered it in the light of the birth of the
    child which the Entry Clearance Officer had plainly been aware  of  but
    still considered that that was insufficient to deal with this issue.

22.   On the judge's consideration of the Razgar  questions,  it  is  plain
    that she resolved them in favour of  the  Appellant  (see  [20]).   The
    judge  then  turned  to  the   issue   of   proportionality.    As   to
    proportionality, the grounds do not make reference  to  this  issue  in
    that sense.  The grounds challenge the findings by  way  of  inadequate
    reasoning as to why the judge found that  it  would  be  "unjustifiably
    harsh".  The judge set out her consideration of the issues at [21]  and
    [22].  They were required to be considered alongside  the  findings  of
    fact made in the earlier part of the determination.   Contrary  to  the
    grounds, the judge gave adequate and sustainable reasons  for  reaching
    the view that the proportionality balance lay  in  favour  of  granting
    entry  clearance  and  that  it  would  be   in   those   circumstances
    "unjustifiably harsh" not to allow the appeal outside of the Rules.

23.  In this context she took into account the reasons  for  refusal  under
    the Immigration Rules.  Whilst the judge referred to it as a "technical
    failure", I am satisfied that this was not seen in the sense of a "near
    miss".  Indeed the Respondent has not sought to argue any  such  point.
    Instead the Respondent argues that the Secretary of State  is  entitled
    to set a minimum income threshold with the aim of ensuring  that  those
    who chose to establish their family life in  the  UK  should  have  the
    financial ability to support themselves such that the  migrant  partner
    does not become a  burden  on  the  taxpayer  and  is  better  able  to
    integrate into society (see paragraph 8 of the grounds).  This was  the
    very point the judge made and placed weight  and  reliance  upon.   The
    judge recorded that the Presenting Officer at the hearing accepted that
    she was employed as  claimed  and  that  she  met  the  minimum  income
    requirement of ï¿½18,600 gross as set out in the Rules and that the  oral
    evidence of her employer was accepted  as  to  her  employment.   Thus,
    contrary to the grounds, it was open to the  judge  to  find  that  the
    Sponsor had demonstrated the requisite level of income which was met at
    the date of decision.  In this context the judge went on to state  that
    in view of this, the legitimate purpose of the Rules to ensure that the
    applicant does not have recourse to public funds had  been  met.   This
    echoes the submission made on behalf of the Respondent at  paragraph  8
    of the grounds that that is the legitimate aim of  the  minimum  income
    threshold requirements.  The judge went on to state:

         "Notwithstanding the very weighty interests of  the  Respondent  in
         maintaining immigration control and the Appellant's failure to meet
         the requirements of the Rules, the significance of  which  I  fully
         take into account, I cannot accept  the  Respondent's  decision  is
         justified in these circumstances."

    This was a finding that was open to the judge  on  the  particular  and
    individual circumstances of this applicant and the judge  was  entitled
    to make that finding and place weight  upon  it  when  considering  the
    issue of proportionality.  However it cannot be said that this was  the
    only factor which was placed in the balance in favour of the Appellant.
     It is plain from reading the determination as a whole that  the  judge
    placed weight upon the medical evidence  relating  to  the  Appellant's
    child  at  [22]  as  set  out  earlier  in  this  determination.    The
    consideration of the child's medical problems and how  it  impacted  on
    the mother and the Appellant was not postdecision evidence  as  it  was
    evidence appertaining to the  factual  circumstances  at  the  date  of
    decision.  The judge was entitled to weigh in the balance the effect of
    the separation between the Appellant and the Sponsor  and  against  the
    circumstances of coping with a child with medical problems as  set  out
    in the evidence and her account that she had been finding it  difficult
    to cope.

     It is further plain from  reading  the  determination  the  judge  had
    formed a favourable impression of the Sponsor and the  evidence  before
    her, both oral and documentary and the  judge  was  entitled  to  place
    weight upon that when reaching a decision on proportionality.

      Whilst the decision may be  characterised  as  a  generous  one,  the
    relevant issue to decide is whether or not the judge erred  in  law  in
    making her decision or whether the grounds in fact amount simply  to  a
    disagreement  with  those  generous  findings.   I  have  reached   the
    conclusion after reading the determination as a whole, considering  the
    evidence that was before the judge and the submissions of the  parties,
    that this was a case where the judge did carefully set out the relevant
    case law and the principles of the leading  cases  and  identified  and
    followed the approach set out in the decision of the Upper Tribunal  in
    Shahzad at paragraph 31 of that decision.  In line with that  approach,
    the judge found at [20] that  there  were  arguably  good  grounds  for
    considering the facts of the case outside the Rules and that there were
    compelling circumstances which were properly identified by  the  judge.
    The judge did  give  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  there  were
    arguably good grounds and therefore that compelling  circumstances  did
    exist on the particular facts of this case.  Whilst the judge  did  not
    specifically direct herself to the issue of making a fresh application,
    it is plain from the issues under discussion that she formed  the  view
    that further separation between the parties was not warranted  for  the
    reasons that she gave.

24. For those reasons, I have reached the conclusion that the Secretary  of
    State has not demonstrated that there  was  an  error  of  law  in  the
    judge's approach and thus the decision shall stand.

Decision:

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not  disclose  an  error  on  a
point of law. The decision stands; the appeal is allowed.
