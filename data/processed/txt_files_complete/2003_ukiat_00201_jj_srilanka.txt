Representation:

For the appellant:  Mr J Martin, counsel instructed by M K Sri & Co.
For the respondent: Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      This is an appeal  by  a  Tamil  citizen  of  Sri  Lanka  against  the
   decision of an adjudicator, Mr N J Blandy, sitting at Hatton Cross on 13
   May 2003, dismissing his appeal on both asylum and human rights grounds.

2. This appellant says he had been a medical orderly for the  Tamil  Tigers
   between 1990 and 1993.  However, his first brush  with  the  authorities
   had come in January 2000. He deals with this in his  witness  statement:
   the army had come to the family house, saying they were looking for  his
   brother, but also telling the claimant they suspected him of involvement
   with the Tamil Tigers.  As a  result  of  that  incident,  he  says  his
   parents made arrangements for him to go to Colombo, which he did without
   incident.

3. However the claimant describes what happened there as follows:

   On 23 March 2000 when I had been in  Colombo  for  about  two  days  the
   police came to the lodge to carry out checks.  I was arrested with eight
   other people who were staying in the same lodge, I was detained for four
   days they interrogated me accusing me of being involved with  the  LTTE.
   They asked me why I had come to Colombo and  what  my  connections  were
   with the LTTE, I denied having  any  such  connections.   They  hung  me
   upside down for about half an hour on three occasions,  they  kicked  me
   and beat me with batons,  they  pushed  me  against  the  wall,  on  one
   occasion they shut my penis in a drawer. On three  of  the  days  of  my
   detention they burnt me with a candle.


   The statement goes on to describe how the appellant left Sri  Lanka  and
   came to this country.  There was some confusion about the dates, but  it
   is clear that on his case they were all in the middle of the year 2000.

4. The adjudicator did not accept the first January detention  and  nothing
   further turns on that.  He  did  accept  that  the  appellant  had  been
   detained in Colombo but these were his views (at  �  6.2)  on  what  had
   happened:

   He produces no medical  evidence  in  support  of  his  allegation.   He
   produces a series of photographs of scarring which he alleges was caused
   by candle wax being spilled upon him.  The reason  why  candles  are  in
   general use and are not regarded as hazardous is that candle wax in fact
   melts at a relatively low temperature and  simply  does  not  cause  any
   injury to adult skin.  In his SEF form he mentioned  being  hung  upside
   down and being beaten seriously with  boots  and  batons  but  mentioned
   nothing about his penis being shut in a drawer or being burned by candle
   wax.  There is no allegation of  being  burned  by  candle  wax  at  his
   interview either.  Notwithstanding the submission made by Mr  O'Brien  I
   do  not  find  it  credible  that  the  appellant's  scarring  shown  in
   photographs 1-5 was caused by candle wax and I consider  his  allegation
   to this effect to be a complete fabrication and highly  damning  to  his
   credibility.  I also note that the appellant  has  produced  no  medical
   evidence in support of his allegation that  his  penis  was  shut  in  a
   drawer. Such an event,  if  true,  would  be  likely  to  cause  serious
   permanent injury to such soft tissue.


5. Leave was given to challenge those credibility findings, no point of law
   being required at that time.  The grounds (not  Mr  Martin's)  on  which
   leave was given suggest that the adjudicator was not entitled  to  reach
   the findings he did, either on the penis  incident,  or  the  candle-wax
   burns without medical evidence.  Mr Martin very  realistically  did  not
   pursue what we must apologise for describing as the penis point; but  he
   did pursue the candle.  He suggested that a  candle  might  be  used  to
   cause burn injuries in a number of ingenious ways; and  made  the  point
   that not all items on public sale are safe.

6. That is no doubt true; but  most  people  have  dropped  candle  wax  on
   themselves in the course of their lives: it  is  a  matter  of  ordinary
   knowledge of life that the temperature at which it melts is not such  as
   to cause any significant harm to adult skin.  We have no  doubt  at  all
   that the adjudicator was well entitled to use his common sense as he did
   on this, as it is now acknowledged he was on the penis point.  (We  note
   in passing (see � 3.2) that the appellant had said at interview that his
   captors would place his penis in a drawer and shut it tight).

7. Adjudicators are constantly exhorted to consider cases as would a  jury,
   and we have no doubt what a jury would have made of this one.  The  only
   difference between the function of an adjudicator and that of a jury  is
   that an adjudicator, like other professional tribunals, is  required  to
   give  reasons.  Mr  Blandy  did  so,  and  in  our  view  they  are  not
   challengeable.  The suggestion that some medical evidence  was  required
   comes ill from an appellant who was best placed to provide it if it  had
   been. There is and was none in this case.

8. The adjudicator's credibility findings leave this appellant as  somebody
   who was subject to a routine arrest in Colombo in March  2000,  eighteen
   months before the ceasefire. There was  no  serious  ill-treatment,  nor
   anything else on the adjudicator's findings  to  show  that  he  was  an
   exceptional case in terms of Jeyachandran [2002] UKIAT 01869, or that he
   might still be "wanted" in terms of Selvaratnam [2003] EWCA Civ 121.

9. Realistically Mr Martin put forward only one point to  suggest  that  he
   might either have been "exceptional" or "wanted". That  comes  from  the
   appellant's witness statement at paragraph 10:


   After coming to the United  Kingdom  I  heard  from  relatives  in  this
   country that my father had  been  detained  I  understand  that  he  was
   arrested after the army had come to the house looking for my brother and
   me.  I also understand that he has now been released.


10. That was not a point pursued by counsel (not, as we  have  already  made
   clear, Mr Martin) before the adjudicator or in the  grounds  of  appeal.
   It is always an easy type of allegation to make in  these  cases.  There
   may be arguments, to which Mr Martin alluded,  as  to  what  documentary
   evidence of the claimant's father's arrest might or might not have  been
   available; but if it had seriously been intended to pursue it before the
   adjudicator, then at least the relations who had been the source of  the
   original information could have been called.

11. Even taken at its highest that passage from the witness statement  gives
   no indication  whether  this  incident  occurred  before  or  after  the
   ceasefire.  It follows that in our view it provides no basis, even if it
   were true, which for the reasons we have already  indicated  we  do  not
   accept, for displacing the adjudicator's findings.

The result is that the appeal is dismissed.
                                                                       [pic]
