                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I have decided, pursuant to rule 34 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008, to decide this appeal without a hearing. This is
      because the parties are in agreement that the decision should  be  set
      aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh.  The
      respondent's  rule  24  response  states  that  the  application   for
      permission to appeal is not opposed and invites the Upper Tribunal  to
      remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

   2. The reason the parties (and I) agree that the decision should  be  set
      aside  and  heard  afresh  is  that  the  appellant  did  not  receive
      notification of the hearing, which proceeded in her absence.

   3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal is
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh by a  different
      judge.
