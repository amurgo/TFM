Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Victor-Mazeli, Counsel instructed by Eden
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Nath, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the decision  by  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to issue him  with  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of his right  to  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  an
    extended family member of an  EEA  national  exercising  treaty  rights
    here.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and
    I do not  consider  that  such  a  direction  is  warranted  for  these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose date of birth is 8  July
    1986.  He arrived in the United Kingdom on 6 November 2010 having  been
    granted leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under  the
    points-based system.  This leave was subsequently extended until 31 May
    2014.

 3. On 19 March 2014 he applied for a residence card as an extended  family
    member of his uncle, Mr Raja Khan, who is a Dutch national.

 4. On 28 April 2014 the Secretary of State gave her reasons  for  refusing
    the application.  He had failed to submit any evidence to prove he  was
    dependent upon his EEA national  sponsor  prior  to  entering  the  UK.
    Since being in the UK, he also had to prove that he was dependent  upon
    him and he was part of the same household as him.  He submitted  Lloyds
    TSB bank statements and a  Jobcentre  Plus  letter  addressed  to  him,
    showing that he lived at  the  same  residential  address  as  his  EEA
    national sponsor.  But he had failed to submit  any  evidence  to  show
    that he was financially dependent upon his EEA  national  sponsor.   He
    had failed to provide sufficient evidence that he  was  dependent  upon
    and/or residing with his sponsor prior to entering the United  Kingdom;
    and that since entering the United Kingdom he continued to be dependent
    upon and/or residing with his sponsor.  It had been decided  to  refuse
    to issue the confirmation  he  sought  with  reference  to  Regulations
    8(2)(a) and (c) of Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Thomas sitting in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal at Birmingham on 9 September  2014.   Both  parties  were
    legally  represented.   The  judge  received  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant and his uncle.  In his subsequent  determination,  the  judge
    found in favour of the respondent.  The appellant had not  proved  that
    he had resided in Holland or Pakistan as the sponsor's dependant or  as
    a member of the sponsor's household.  Furthermore, he  had  not  proved
    that he was dependent on the sponsor here in the  United  Kingdom.   It
    was arguable as to whether the appellant was a member of the  sponsor's
    household rather than the household of the sponsor's son, since it  was
    the  sponsor's  son  who  paid  the  mortgage  and  all  the  household
    expenditures.  In the circumstances, the appellant had  not  proved  he
    was entitled to reside in the United  Kingdom  as  an  extended  family
    member under Regulation 8.  The judge  also  dismissed  an  alternative
    claim under Article 8 ECHR.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 6. On 24 November 2014  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Macdonald
    granted the appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The
    judge had  considered  the  evidence  in  his  findings  commencing  at
    paragraph 12, and it was arguable in paragraph 14 that  the  judge  did
    not make clear what evidence of the sponsor and the appellant was being
    rejected or accepted, and this might amount to  an  arguable  error  in
    law.  Contrary to the grounds, the judge had considered Article  8  and
    had taken account of the Immigration Rules and referred  to  well-known
    case law.  There therefore appeared be  no  merit  in  this  ground  of
    appeal.  Nevertheless, for the sake of clarity, permission was  granted
    on all grounds in line  with  Ferrer  (Limited  appeal  grounds;  Alvi)
    [2012] UK 00304 (IAC).

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 7. At the hearing before me, Ms Victor-Mazeli, who did not  appear  below,
    relied on an extensive skeleton argument prepared by a  colleague.  She
    maintained that the judge had erred in law in both his disposal of  the
    claim under the Regulations 2006 and in his disposal of the  Article  8
    claim.  In reply, Mr Nath contended that the judge had  given  adequate
    reasons for dismissing the appeal. .

Discussion

 8. I find the judge gave adequate reasons for dismissing the appeal  under
    the Regulations of 2006.  At paragraph 14 he  addressed  the  issue  of
    prior and current financial dependency.  Although he switched back  and
    forth between the two, it is tolerably clear that  the  judge  rejected
    the evidence of the appellant and the sponsor as to:

      a) prior financial dependency; and

      b) current financial dependency.

 9. Ms Victor-Mazeli submitted that the judge ought to  have  accepted  the
    oral evidence of the sponsor and the appellant on the question of prior
    financial dependency.  But it was open to the judge to reject the  oral
    evidence of the witnesses for the reasons he gave:

         It is said that the sponsor  supported  the  appellant  monthly  in
         Pakistan using Western Union transfer  monies  to  the  appellant's
         mother and later to the  appellant  himself.   Again  there  is  no
         documentary evidence, no evidence to show any attempt made  by  the
         appellant to secure such evidence even from records.   I  am  told,
         and it has not been rebutted, the appellant's college was named  as
         his sponsor and that there was no mention of his  uncle  being  his
         sponsor.  The sponsor's annual income is �5,832.  It  is  difficult
         to see how he can support his own family and the appellant and  pay
         for the appellant's education from that level of income.  There  is
         no other evidence of the sponsor's personal financial circumstances
         before me.  I accept the sponsor's son earns �60,000 annually,  and
         that he bears the household  expenses.   However,  the  appellant's
         case is that he is dependent on his uncle, not on his first  cousin
         who was a British citizen.

10. Accordingly, the principal reason given by the judge  for  disbelieving
    the oral evidence of the sponsor and the appellant was the  absence  of
    Western Union money transfer receipts.  But the judge  also  reasonably
    questioned the credibility of the claimed financial support in view  of
    the sponsor's low annual income.  The sponsor's low annual  income  was
    principally relevant to the question of present  financial  dependency,
    but it also had some relevance to the question of whether it was likely
    that the sponsor was likely to have been able to support the  appellant
    when he  was  living  in  Pakistan.   In  any  event,  the  absence  of
    documentary evidence of  remittances  to  Pakistan  was  sufficient  by
    itself to sustain the adverse credibility finding with regard to  prior
    financial dependency.

11. Ms Victor-Mazeli also took issue with his finding  that  the  appellant
    was not a member of the sponsor's household in the UK, despite the fact
    that it was accepted in the refusal letter that they lived at the  same
    residential address.

12. It was entirely legitimate  for  the  judge  to  question  whether  the
    appellant was properly to be treated  as  a  member  of  the  sponsor's
    household, as opposed to being treated as a member of the household  of
    the sponsor's son, in view of the fact that it  was  the  son  who  was
    paying the mortgage and all the  household  expenditure.   He  did  not
    reach a conclusion, and effectively left this question unresolved.  But
    it was not a question which he needed to resolve, as he  made  a  clear
    finding that there was no prior  financial  dependency;  and  that  the
    appellant had not been a member of the sponsor's  household  in  either
    Pakistan or Holland.

13. In order to qualify as an extended family member, the appellant had  to
    prove:

      a) prior dependency and present dependency; or

      b) prior membership  of  a  household  and  present  membership  of  a
         household;

      c) prior dependency and present membership of a household; or

      d) prior membership of a household and present dependency.

14. It did not ultimately matter whether the appellant could prove  present
    membership of the sponsor's household, or  indeed  present  dependency.
    For he had to prove one of these in combination with  prior  dependency
    or prior membership of the sponsor's household. Since it was  not  part
    of his case that he satisfied the requirement of "prior membership of a
    household", in order to succeed in his appeal he had  to  prove  "prior
    dependency".  As previously noted, the judge gave adequate reasons  for
    finding that the appellant had not shown prior dependency.

15. In the application for permission to appeal,  it  is  argued  that  the
    judge erred in law in not applying the two stage approach proved by the
    Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v  SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192.   The
    contention is wholly without merit.  The judge's consideration  of  the
    Article 8 claim is impeccable.

16. At paragraph 16 he considered whether the appellant could bring himself
    within paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Rules.   He  rightly  answered  this
    question in the negative.

17. At paragraph 17 he asked himself whether the  appellant  had  a  family
    life claim within the scope of Appendix FM, and rightly  answered  this
    question in the negative.  He went on to observe that the decision  did
    not require the appellant to leave the United Kingdom, and  there  were
    no removal directions against him.  In the light of these  matters,  he
    found that there  were  no  particular  reasons  at  this  stage  which
    required him to consider proportionality outside the Rules.  But in the
    same paragraph, he made it clear that he was guided inter alia  by  the
    case law of MM [2013] EWHC 1900  (Admin),  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  00640
    (IAC), Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)  and  Haleemuden  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 558.   In  the  light  of
    these authorities, the judge was not bound to undertake a  freestanding
    proportionality assessment outside the Rules in circumstances where the
    interference  was  very  limited   and   there   were   no   compelling
    circumstances disclosed by the evidence that were capable of  rendering
    the proposed interference a disproportionate one.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order.
