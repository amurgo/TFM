                           Emmanuel Damola Odusola

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Olubisose of Messrs M Olubi Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Devittie  and
    Sir Geoffrey James (lay member)) who, in a determination promulgated on
    9 September 2013 allowed the appellant's appeal against a decision made
    by the respondent on 25 March 2013 to make a deportation order  against
    him under the provisions of Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act.

2.   Although the Secretary of State was the  appellant  before  me  I,  for
    ease of reference, refer to her  as  the  respondent  as  she  was  the
    respondent before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Similarly,  although  Mr
    Emmanuel  Damola  Odusola  is  the  respondent  I  will,  for  ease  of
    reference, refer to him as the appellant as he was the appellant in the
    First-tier Tribunal.

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 30 April  1992  who  came
    to Britain on 16 March 2004 with entry clearance for  settlement  as  a
    dependant of his parents.

4.   On 22 December 2011 he was convicted at Woolwich Crown Court  of  three
    counts of possession with intent to supply a controlled  class  A  drug
    (crack cocaine) and one count of possession with  intent  to  supply  a
    controlled class A drug (heroin) and was sentenced in respect  of  both
    offences in January 2012 to a total of four years' detention in a young
    offenders' institution.

5.   The trial judge, His Honour Judge Saggerston stated in  his  sentencing
    remarks:-

         "You were found guilty of very serious offences.  Only an immediate
         sentence of detention can be justified for supplying on this scale.
          You were in  my  judgment,  quite  clearly  retailing  appreciable
         quantities of class A drugs to a large group of customers, but I do
         bear in mind that, in this case, no stock or  stash  of  drugs  was
         found, either at your home or anywhere else  attributable  to  you,
         other than what was found discarded as you tried to escape from the
         police.  I bear in mind that, in your case, the level of  retailing
         which was involved, does not appear to have  given  rise  to  large
         cash profits, they being  only  �451  in  your  possession  clearly
         related to drugs dealing.


         I also bear in mind that at the time of all this, although you were
         subject to a suspended sentence, you are only 18 years old and  all
         these factors mean that I can pass a sentence of detention that  is
         notably lower than that which would otherwise have  been  the  case
         had you been 21 years or older.


         In all the circumstances, for each  of  these  offences,  you  will
         serve a sentence of detention of four years.  Those sentences  will
         all be concurrent, one with the  other,  making  a  total  of  four
         years' detention.  The suspended sentence that you have admitted to
         being in breach of shall be activated.  I am going to  activate  as
         to four weeks and I am going to order that the  suspended  sentence
         is activated to four weeks and should be served concurrently."

6.   The Tribunal noted the terms of paragraphs 362, 363, 397, 398  and  399
    of the Rules and concluded that the appellant could not succeed  in  an
    argument that his rights under Article 8 of the ECHR would be infringed
    by the decision within the context of the Rules.  They however  allowed
    the appeal on human rights grounds on the basis that the removal of the
    appellant would be a  disproportionate  interference  with  his  rights
    under Article 8 when considered within  the  context  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.

7.   The Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant's  father,  his  mother,
    the appellant's fianc�, his sister and his brother, which they set  out
    in paragraphs 9 onwards of the determination.  It was  the  appellant's
    father's evidence that the appellant was genuine  in  his  remorse  and
    that they are a close family and that he had not been aware before  the
    appellant's conviction that he had been involved in drugs.  He did  not
    believe that the appellant would be able to survive in Nigeria  without
    the support of his immediate family.  He stated  that  his  own  mother
    lived in Nigeria but was aged 86 and not in a  position  to  offer  any
    support to the appellant.  The appellant's mother also gave evidence as
    to the closeness of the family and his fianc�e had said  that  she  was
    very close to him.  His brother and sister gave similar evidence.

8.   In paragraph 14 onwards the Tribunal set out their  assessment  of  the
    evidence, referring to the headnote in Green (Article 8  -  new  Rules)
    [2013] UKUT 251 (IAC) which they quoted,  and  referring  also  to  the
    determinations  in  Masih  (deportation  -  public  interest  -   basic
    principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 46 (IAC).

9.   In paragraph 19 they stated that the appellant had established  private
    life in Britain and that his deportation would constitute  interference
    of such gravity as to engage his Article 8 rights under the Convention.
     In paragraph 20 they wrote:-

         "20. The evidence of the appellant's parents demonstrates the  very
             close and mutual bond that exists between parents and son.  We
             recognise that the appellant has a close relationship with his
             siblings.  He derives significant support from all the members
             of his immediate family.  The appellant has been  living  with
             his parents and is likely  to  continue  to  do  so  upon  his
             release.  At the age of 21 however, he  is  an  adult  who  is
             capable of leading an independent life, and there  is  nothing
             at all in the evidence that demonstrates his incapacity to  do
             so.  His parents are both in full-time employment and are  not
             dependent on him  for  their  daily  needs.   Apart  from  the
             evidence of the close relationship he has with  his  siblings,
             there is no evidence to show a degree of dependency  with  any
             of his family  members,  that  amounts  to  more  than  normal
             emotional  ties.   We  do  not  therefore  consider  that  the
             appellant's relationship with his family  members  constitutes
             family life that would be sufficient to invoke the  protection
             of article 8.  We acknowledge  that  the  appellant  is  in  a
             genuine  relationship  with  his  fianc�e.   She  has  yet  to
             complete her studies.  They live apart and have done so  since
             the commencement of the relationship.  We do not consider that
             his relationship with his fianc�e has demonstrated a level  of
             durability sufficient to constitute established family life in
             the United Kingdom."

10.  They then referred to the decision in Uner v the  Netherlands  46410/99
    [2006] ECHR 873 and to the judgment of the Court of  Appeal  in  Maslov
    [2008] ECHR 546.

11.  They referred to the judgment in the Court of  Appeal  in  JO  (Uganda)
    [2010] EWCA Civ 10 where it was  held  that  an  important  factor  was
    whether or not an appellant was a young adult.

12.  In paragraphs 26, 27 and 28 they wrote:-

         "26.     We begin our assessment of proportionality by  considering
             firstly, those factors  personal  to  the  appellant  and  his
             family, which weigh in his favour in the balancing exercise.


             (i)  The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom at the age of
                  12, and is now aged 21.  It is  clear  therefore  that  he
                  spent at least  half  his  life  in  the  United  Kingdom,
                  including his period of incarceration.  The appellant  has
                  not yet established independent family life.  He committed
                  the offences in question when he  was  still  a  juvenile,
                  aged 16, and consequently was sentenced to detention in  a
                  young offender's institution.  We also take note that  the
                  appellant  does  not  have  any  ties,  including  social,
                  cultural or family  with  Nigeria.   We  accept  that  his
                  parents have retained strong ties  in  Nigeria,  and  that
                  they have visited Nigeria not infrequently.  The appellant
                  has not returned to  Nigeria  since  his  arrival  in  the
                  United Kingdom.  There is no  suggestion  that  since  his
                  arrival he has retained close links with  the  persons  of
                  Nigerian origin and culture in  the  United  Kingdom.   We
                  find therefore that there is  no  basis  in  the  evidence
                  before us upon which he would reach a conclusion that  the
                  appellant does have social, cultural and  family  ties  in
                  Nigeria.   The  respondent's  counsel  did  not,   as   we
                  understood her submissions, argue to the  contrary.   This
                  is therefore clearly a case,  where,  in  accordance  with
                  accepted authority, very serious reasons are  required  in
                  order to justify the appellant's deportation.


             (ii) We recognise that the  appellant  is  part  of  a  strong
                  family unit  comprising  his  parents  and  siblings.   We
                  accept the emotional stress  that  his  incarceration  has
                  caused his family and that his deportation  would  add  to
                  the  agony  that  they  have  endured.    We   share   the
                  appellant's mother's  concern  that  he  would  have  some
                  hardship in adjusting to  life  in  Nigeria.   We  do  not
                  however accept that the relationship between the appellant
                  and his parents, and siblings, engages article  8,  as  it
                  has not  been  demonstrated  that  there  are  degrees  of
                  dependency that go beyond normal emotional ties.


         27.  In so far as the public interest  consideration  that  support
             the  appellant's  deportation  are  concerned,  the  following
             factors are relevant, in our view:
             (i)  The appellant  has  been  convicted  of  a  very  serious
                  offence.  The potential harm to society in general  caused
                  by the supply of class A drugs  is  a  feature  that  does
                  cause us real concern and to which we  attach  significant
                  weight.   The  trial  court  drew  attention  to   several
                  aggravating  features,  including,  the  fact   that   the
                  appellant was retailing appreciable quantities of class  A
                  drugs to a large group of customers, and, the fact that at
                  the time of the offence, the appellant was  subject  to  a
                  suspended sentence, on a  related  offence.   Indeed,  the
                  gravity of the offence is demonstrated by  the  length  of
                  sentence that the  appellant  received.   There  are  very
                  compelling public interest considerations in our view, for
                  deporting foreign criminals who commit  serious  offences,
                  as the appellant has done.  Firstly, deportation expresses
                  society's condemnation of serious criminal  activity,  and
                  equally important, it promotes public  confidence  in  the
                  treatment of foreign criminals who commit serious crimes.


             (ii) The respondent's representative Ms  McAllister  submitted
                  that we should find that there  is  a  real  risk  of  the
                  appellant reoffending.  She submitted that  there  was  no
                  documentary evidence to demonstrate the appellant had done
                  any courses in  prison.   He  committed  the  offences  in
                  question for financial gain, and the evidence as  a  whole
                  did not demonstrate that he has taken any  real  steps  to
                  address the causes of his offending  behaviour  by  taking
                  courses then by considering options for employment.  These
                  submissions merit serious  consideration.   The  appellant
                  did not produce any evidence of courses  he  had  done  in
                  prison.  He stated that he was genuinely  remorseful.   He
                  stated that he had done  cannabis  awareness  courses  but
                  provided no documentary evidence to prove this.  We do not
                  have the benefit of an OASYS  report  and  there  is  very
                  little  evidence  from  the  appellant  to  demonstrate  a
                  genuine commitment  to  rehabilitation.   The  one  factor
                  though, which weighs heavily in his favour in this regard,
                  and perhaps tips the balance, is the  very  strong  family
                  support that he enjoys from  both  his  parents,  who  are
                  British  citizens  and  whom  have  been  employed  for  a
                  significant  period  in  the  health  industry,  and   his
                  siblings, all of whom have excelled in their studies,  and
                  are established in professional careers.  We are satisfied
                  the appellant would continue to receive support  from  his
                  family, and that  this  would  operate  as  a  significant
                  factor in reducing risk of reoffending.  We find therefore
                  on the evidence before us that there  is  a  risk  of  the
                  appellant reoffending, which we would  assess  as  between
                  low and medium.


         28.  The appellant has failed  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
             immigration rules.  Therefore, although not required  to  meet
             the test of exceptionality, exceptional circumstances have  to
             be shown for him to succeed  outside  the  immigration  rules.
             The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom at a young age; he
             is a young adult who committed the offence at the young age of
             17; he has spent the major part of his youth and at least half
             his life in the United Kingdom, and does not have any  social,
             cultural or family ties in Nigeria.  These  circumstances  are
             in our view exceptional and, having  regard  to  all  relevant
             considerations, we are satisfied that the decision  to  deport
             the appellant is not proportionate."


13.  The Tribunal therefore allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

14.  The Secretary of State appealed.  The first ground of appeal  was  that
    the Tribunal had erred in applying a two stage test  in  following  the
    Tribunal decision in MF (Nigeria) [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC) stating  that
    the conclusion in that determination that the Immigration Rules did not
    fully reflect the "Maslov/Boultif" principles was  a  misinterpretation
    of the Rules as those principles were reflected in the Rules in the way
    that ensures  consistency  of  assessment.   It  was  argued  that  the
    Tribunal should not have simply regarded the Rules as a starting  point
    before moving on to a second freestanding  Article  8  assessment,  and
    that if the Tribunal had  considered  that  factors  not  addressed  in
    paragraphs 339 or 399A merited allowing a deportation appeal it  should
    have considered them when looking at whether there were any exceptional
    circumstances under paragraph 397 or 398 of the Rules that  meant  that
    the consequences of deportation produced an unjustifiably harsh outcome
    incompatible with Article 8 despite the public interest in deportation.

15.  They referred to the fact that the determination in  MF  (Nigeria)  had
    indicated that judges had much more limited scope when considering  the
    public interest in deportation as the Rules were now a clear expression
    of public interest and the weight attached to it, as  set  out  by  the
    Secretary of State and endorsed by Parliament.   The  grounds  asserted
    that a reading of the determination MF (Nigeria) meant that even  where
    the Tribunal was considering  whether  the  outcome  was  unjustifiably
    harsh, the reflection of the public interest  contained  in  the  Rules
    should be given significant weight in that assessment.

16.  The second ground of appeal stated that  the  Tribunal  had  failed  to
    give adequate reasons for findings on material  matters.   Firstly,  it
    was pointed out that the Tribunal had in  paragraph  27(i)  found  that
    despite there  being  "very  little  evidence  from  the  appellant  to
    demonstrate a genuine commitment to rehabilitation", but had then  gone
    on to find that the appellant had the support of his family which would
    prevent him reoffending.  It was submitted that the Tribunal had failed
    to provide adequate reasons for their  findings  as  there  was  little
    evidence as to what support the  appellant's   family  could  give  him
    and, even if  his  family  were  providing  him  with  support  it  was
    submitted that the Tribunal had failed to provide adequate  reasons  as
    to  why that would reduce his risk of reoffending in future or risk  of
    harm to the public, especially given that his family had been unable to
    exert any sufficient influence over him in the past, and there  was  no
    evidence that they would be able to do so now.

17.  Moreover, the Tribunal had found that the appellant's  family  members'
    work, studies and careers were a positive  factor  but  had  failed  to
    provide any reasons as to why that had any relevance  in  reducing  the
    appellant's  risk  factors.   It  was   submitted   that   his   family
    circumstances  were  similar  to  those  when  he  was  committing  his
    offences, and his family had failed to have any influence on  him,  and
    there was no evidence that they would do so now.  It was  pointed  out,
    moreover, that the appellant  had  stated  in  his  evidence  that  his
    grandparents had died, whereas his father had stated  that  his  mother
    was alive in Nigeria.  The  Tribunal  had  failed  to  take  that  into
    account and provide adequate reasons as to why the  appellant  and  his
    family's evidence was credible given that discrepancy.

18.  It was pointed out that the  Tribunal  had  stated  that  very  serious
    grounds were required to justify deportation but that  they  had  found
    that there was no evidence that  the  appellant  had  reformed  and  no
    evidence  that  his  family  would  be  able  to  reduce  his  risk  of
    reoffending and risk of harm to the public. It was  submitted  that  he
    had  committed  serious  crimes  which   justified    the   appellant's
    deportation and that it was proportionate to  deport  him  given  those
    continuing risks.

19.  It was further argued that the Tribunal had found  that  the  appellant
    had established private life here but it was submitted the Tribunal had
    failed to provide any reasons as to what private life the appellant had
    established here and why this could not be continued  in  Nigeria.   It
    was submitted that there was nothing exceptional about his private life
    here that could not be continued in Nigeria.

20.  It was also argued that the Tribunal had failed  to  give  any  reasons
    why they had concluded that the appellant had no ties in Nigeria as  he
    had spent the first twelve  years  of  his  life  there  including  his
    formative years and part of his education there, and would be  familiar
    with the culture and customs there.  He had family ties in  Nigeria  as
    his grandmother still lived there.  As the Tribunal had found that  the
    appellant was an adult capable of leading an  independent  life,  there
    was no reason why he could not stay with  his  grandmother  in  Nigeria
    until he readapted to life there.  It  was  submitted  the  appellant's
    family could provide him with financial support if needed and he  could
    maintain contact  with  them  in  the  UK  through  modern  methods  of
    communication as he had been able to do so whilst in prison,  and  they
    could visit him as his father had shown he was able to do  so  when  he
    visited his mother.

21.  It was submitted that the Tribunal had failed to  provide  any  reasons
    why  the  appellant's  interests  outweighed  the  public  interest  in
    deportation.  Given these factors  it  was  argued  that  the  Tribunal
    should  have  found  that  the  deportation  of   the   appellant   was
    proportionate.

22.  At the hearing of the appeal before me Mr Walker relied on the  grounds
    of appeal.  He stated that  there  were  really  no  specific  findings
    regarding the appellant's family  or  cultural  ties  in  Nigeria.   He
    referred to the fact that in the decision letter details were given  of
    the appellant's parents' travels to Nigeria - his mother  had  returned
    to Nigeria in 2006, 2007 and 2008 to visit relatives,  and  his  father
    had sponsored various relatives and friends from Nigeria  between  2005
    and October 2012 to visit him which clearly indicated that  the  family
    still maintained strong links to Nigeria.   Moreover,  the  letter  had
    stated that as the appellant had spent around twelve years  in  Nigeria
    and was  therefore  familiar  with  the  native  language  it  was  not
    considered that language would be a barrier to his returning.

23.  The Tribunal had failed, moreover, to consider and place weight on  the
    fact that the appellant's  parents  had  not  been  able  to  stop  the
    appellant turning to crime in 2008 and there was  no  reason  why  they
    should have any further influence over him now, particularly as he  was
    now an adult.

24.  He therefore asked me to find that there were material  errors  of  law
    in the determination and to set the determination aside.

25.  In reply  Mr  Olubisose  referred  to  the  length  of  time  that  the
    appellant had lived in Britain and what he said  were  the  appellant's
    substantial  connections  with  this  country.   He  stated  that   the
    appellant had passed a number of exams here aside from the certificates
    which he had obtained while  in  prison  and  that  could  have  looked
    forward to a good career in this country.

26.   He  argued  that  the  Tribunal  had  "meticulously"  considered   the
    appellant's  circumstances  and  their  assessment  of  the  facts  was
    comprehensive and followed authority, and that  they  were  correct  to
    find that there were exceptional circumstances which  would  mean  that
    the deportation of the appellant would be disproportionate.  He  argued
    that they properly referred to and weighed up relevant public  interest
    factors.  He emphasised that the appellant was  remorseful  and  stated
    that the Tribunal had taken into account that he had been rehabilitated
    while detained.  He emphasised that the appellant's  parents  had  been
    unaware of his involvement with drugs but now that they were they would
    make sure that he did not become involved in drugs or drug  trafficking
    again.

27.  He stated that the appellant would have no one with whom he could  live
    in Nigeria because his grandmother was now very old and  could  die  at
    any moment.  The appellant was the youngest in his family and  the  one
    who the other members of the family would look after and  that  in  the
    future they would ensure that he pursued his career and did not  commit
    any further offences.

28.  In any event he emphasised the young age at  which  the  appellant  had
    committed the index offences and stated that the Tribunal had  taken  a
    balanced view in their assessment of the evidence, taking into  account
    the sentencing remarks and relevant case law.

29.  He emphasised the relationship of the appellant with  his  fianc�e  who
    was British of Ghanaian origin and had never lived in Nigeria. He asked
    me therefore to dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

30.  Having withdrawn briefly I returned to court and gave  my  reasons  for
    finding that there was a material error of law in the determination  of
    the Tribunal.

Error of law decision
31.  The reality is that although the Tribunal set out at some  considerable
    length relevant case law such as the factors on which weight was placed
    in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Uner  and  the
    headnote of the determination in Masih, they did not  apply  that  case
    law.  While in paragraph 27 they stated that  the  appellant  had  been
    convicted of a very serious offence and noted  the  potential  harm  to
    society caused by the supply of class A drugs, which they stated caused
    them  real  concern,  and  furthermore  that  the  "trial  court"  drew
    attention to several aggravating features including the fact  that  the
    appellant was retailing appreciable quantities of class A  drugs  to  a
    large group of customers, that he had been  subjected  to  a  suspended
    sentence at the time of the offence for a related offence and that  the
    gravity of the appellant's offence was demonstrated by  the  length  of
    sentence, and then gone on to note the very compelling public  interest
    considerations for deporting foreign criminals  who  committed  serious
    offences, that  simply did not apply that gloss on case law  and  their
    assessment of the  seriousness  of  the  appellant's  offences  to  the
    particular circumstances of the appellant.   The  reality  is  that  in
    paragraph 20 they  had  made  a  clear  finding  that  the  appellant's
    relationship with his family members or indeed with his girlfriend  did
    not  constitute family life that would  be  sufficient  to  invoke  the
    protection of Article 8 - a conclusion which they repeated in paragraph
    26(ii).  Moreover, they concluded their assessment of  the  appellant's
    circumstances in paragraph 27(ii) with a conclusion that  there  was  a
    risk of the appellant re-offending, which they would assess as "between
    low and medium".  They had also  noted  that  there  was  "very  little
    evidence from the appellant to  demonstrate  a  genuine  commitment  to
    rehabilitation" and stated that the  evidence  as  a  whole  "does  not
    demonstrate that he had taken any real steps to address the  causes  of
    the offending behaviour by taking courses  then  by  (sic)  considering
    options for employment".

33.  All these factors would surely have  led  them  to  conclude  that  the
    deportation of the appellant was proportionate.  However, the  Tribunal
    decided that it would not be disproportionate on the basis  that  there
    was what they referred to as "one factor" which weighed heavily in  the
    appellant's favour and "perhaps tips the balance, which was the  strong
    family support that he enjoyed  from  his  parents,  who  were  British
    citizens, and his siblings".  However, they simply did  not  appear  to
    consider that support within the context of the fact that the appellant
    had been living at home  when  not  only  the  index  offence  but  the
    previous offence for which he received a suspended sentence  had  taken
    place.  That is completely illogical.  Having found that the  appellant
    had shown very little evidence to demonstrate a genuine  commitment  to
    rehabilitation, and having assessed his risk of reoffending as  between
    low and medium, and having noted the public interest in the deportation
    of foreign criminals, it was simply not open to the Tribunal to  decide
    that the one factor which weighed in  his  favour  and  might  tip  the
    balance was his family here when they  had  found  not  only  that  the
    appellant was not exercising family life with his family here but  they
    had been unable to assist him in the past.

34.  It is correct of course that the Tribunal did go on to assess a  number
    of other factors, including the appellant's young age, stating that  he
    had committed the offence at the age of 17 and then incorrectly stating
    that the appellant had spent the major part of his youth, at least half
    his life, in Britain, before reaching a conclusion that he did not have
    any social, cultural or family ties to Nigeria - a factor which  simply
    goes against his father's evidence which was that the appellant  had  a
    grandmother in Nigeria and further the evidence  that  the  appellant's
    parents had travelled to Nigeria  on  a  number  of  occasions  in  the
    previous few years.   Again  it  was  illogical  for  the  Tribunal  in
    paragraph 26(i) to conclude that the appellant's parents  had  retained
    strong ties to Nigeria but to state that there was nothing  to  suggest
    the appellant had retained close links with "persons of Nigerian origin
    and culture in the United Kingdom".  The reality is of course  that  he
    had maintained strong links with his own family who  were  of  Nigerian
    origin and that the family's links  in  this  country  appeared  to  be
    within the Nigerian diaspora, although it is  correct  that  there  was
    very little evidence for the appellant's involvement  with  any  people
    here other than his own family and his girlfriend with whom, of course,
    he has never lived and who has a separate  life  from  him  as  she  is
    studying here.

35.  While it is the case that the Tribunal referred to some  relevant  case
    law they did not have regard to the leading case of SS (Nigeria) [2013]
    EWCA Civ 550 which emphasised the  importance  of  accepting  that  the
    public interest as defined in the 2007 Act  and  indeed  in  the  Rules
    severely limited the scope for a  Tribunal  to  find  that  deportation
    could be avoided by an assessment  that  removal  was  disproportionate
    rather than the fact that in cases of the deportation of a criminal the
    more pressing public interest in removal,  the  stronger  must  be  the
    claim under Article 8 if it is to prevail.

36.  Having set aside the  determination  of  the  Tribunal,  I  asked  both
    representatives whether or not they were able  to  go  ahead  with  the
    hearing so that I could remake the decision.  I rose for ten minutes to
    enable Mr Olubisose to take instructions and prepare for the hearing.

37.  Mr Walker did submit the PNC record which  showed  that  the  appellant
    had first been reprimanded in June 2006 for an offence against property
    and then had received a postponed  sentence  for  having  an  offensive
    weapon in public in October 2010,  the  sentence  being  suspended  for
    twelve months on the basis  that  he  was  required  ro  attend  at  an
    attendance centre.  He had been charged with possession of cannabis  in
    June 2011 and thereafter in January 2012  had  been  sentenced  to  the
    index offences.  Mr Walker also put forward a "sponsor  search  results
    list" which showed a number of fifteen people being  sponsored  by  the
    appellant's father for visits to Britain, a number of whom  were  of  a
    type known as "other relative" or "friend".

38.  The appellant was asked about those that his father had  sponsored  and
    said that he had not realised that his father had sponsored  people  to
    come into Britain but he had not been close to any of  them.   He  said
    that he had never met his grandmother.  With regard to how  the  regime
    at the young offenders' institution had changed him, he  said  that  he
    had improved and that he was getting a lot of time with  probation  and
    getting certificates and being put in  the  right  direction.   He  had
    undertaken a business skills set up  course  and  was  currently  doing
    plumbing, carpentry and painting and decorating courses, each of  which
    would give him skills to help him get work - there  was  a  possibility
    that he could become a British Gas fitter if he could be taken on as an
    apprentice.

39.  He was asked why he had offended when he was living  with  his  parents
    and why he would no longer offend if he returned to live with them.  He
    replied that he had grown up and had received guidance from his brother
    and sister who had now finished university.  He wanted to contribute to
    society. Mr Walker asked him what relatives he knew when he  had  lived
    in Nigeria.  He replied that he could not remember what  any  relatives
    he had met looked like but there had not been many.



40.  He was then asked if he could return to Nigeria with the  skills  which
    he had learned.  He said he did not know his way around the country and
    it would be hard for him to start over there.  When  asked  whether  or
    not his family would be able  to  support  him  he  said  it  would  be
    different from them.

41.  He stated the reason his family had not known about what he  was  doing
    was that he had done it all outside the house.  They had known some  of
    his friends but not necessarily those with whom he was mixing.  None of
    his other friends had been convicted of drugs offences.

42.  He was then asked about the two other reprimands.   He  said  he  could
    only remember the first one which was for criminal damage.  His parents
    had known of this.

43.  He said that he had been on a number of drugs awareness courses.

44.  Asked about his family  members  he  emphasised  that  all  his  family
    members are in Britain.

45.  His father Nathaneal  Odusola  then  gave  evidence,  stating  that  he
    believed that the appellant had committed the offences when he had been
    at home, off school after having been in hospital with rickets.  He and
    the appellant's mother had been out at work and therefore the appellant
    had been left on his own and that was when he had got into trouble.

46.  He said that he and his family were connected  with  the  local  church
    and that he had been round to see the parents of people with  whom  his
    son had associated, telling them that he did not want those children to
    have anything to do with the appellant.  He had spoken to the appellant
    and he said it was clear that his son had changed.  He emphasised  that
    his mother was too old to look after the appellant given that  she  was
    aged 86 and in poor health.

47.  In reply to questions from Mr Walker he said that the family had  lived
    in Ibadun which was a large city, before they came to Britain.  He  was
    asked what other relatives he had in Nigeria and he said that there was
    nobody there as his senior brother was in America.  It was then put  to
    him that he had sponsored a number of  people  including  relatives  to
    come to Britain.  He denied that he had sponsored any  relatives  here.
    Asked about a visitor in August last year he  said  it  was  a  medical
    doctor who was no relation.  The  people  he  had  sponsored  were  not
    people he could ask to help with his son.

48.  With regard to  the  appellant's  first  conviction  he  said  that  he
    believed that the appellant  had  been  throwing  a  ball  around  with
    friends and the ball had gone through a window.  He had been  asked  to
    collect the appellant from the police station.

49.  He went on to say that  he  did  not  know  that  his  son  had  become
    involved in drugs.  He added that he would not be able to  support  the
    appellant financially if he returned to  Nigeria  because  of  his  own
    financial commitments and would have difficulty  in  visiting  his  son
    because of their own economic struggles to pay the mortgage.

50.  The appellant's mother then gave evidence  and  said  that  they  would
    wish to do the right thing by their son and would ensure  that  he  did
    not re-offend.  She said she had last visited Nigeria in  2010  when  a
    family friend was getting married.  She knew nothing about  the  people
    whom her husband had sponsored to come to Britain.

51.  In summing up Mr Walker relied on the deportation letter which set  out
    the appellant's immigration  history.  He  emphasised  the  appellant's
    parents had not been  able  to  influence  him  before  conviction  and
    therefore there was no reason why they would be able to  influence  him
    in the future.  The appellant would be  able  to  maintain  contact  by
    other means of communication from Nigeria and indeed  the  reality  was
    that his parents had visited Nigeria on a number of occasions over  the
    last few years and would be able to go on visiting.   He  asked  me  to
    find that the  appellant's  offence  was  such  that  his  removal  was
    entirely proportionate, particularly when viewed within the context  of
    legislation and recent case law.

52.  In reply Mr Olubisose stated that the evidence was that  the  appellant
    did not have family in Nigeria.  He was  the  youngest  member  of  the
    family and would have the full support of his parents, his brother  and
    his sister here.  He emphasised the appellant's fianc�e  would  not  be
    able to go to Nigeria as she was British but of Ghanaian origin and her
    whole life was here.  He said that  the appellant was full  of  remorse
    and stated that the facts in this case were  exceptional,  particularly
    given the young age at which the appellant had committed the  offences.
    The other offences of which he had been  charged  were  trivial  -  the
    first relating to an incident when playing with a ball with friends.

53.  He stated there was clear  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  studied
    various courses here and was doing all he could in order to further his
    career in this country.  He asked me to allow the appeal.

Discussion
54.  In determining this appeal I have  taken  into  account  not  only  the
    evidence before  me  but  also  the  various  statements  made  by  the
    appellant, his parents, his siblings and his girlfriend Jasmin Adjeiwaa
    Assanoh who referred to the appellant as her boyfriend.  She is  German
    and stated that she had been in a relationship with the  appellant  for
    over five years and that they wished to live together permanently.

55.  The appellant's siblings set out their own career  paths  -  they  have
    both obtained considerable qualifications here.  They stated  they  did
    not have family members in Nigeria.  The appellant's father referred to
    the appellant having an important role  in  church  and  in  the  youth
    department where he had  organised  different  youth  clubs  and  Bible
    quizzes and stated that he was "truly a role model to others".

56.  The appellant's statement emphasised his remorse.

57.  The appellant  has  been  convicted  of  a  very  serious  crime.   The
    approach to a consideration of the rights of an appellant under Article
    8 of the ECHR has been clarified in the judgment of the Court of Appeal
    in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192.   Firstly,  it  is  relevant  to
    consider the appeal under the terms of the Rules.  The reality is  that
    the Secretary of State has deemed the deportation of the  appellant  to
    be in the public interest because he has been convicted of  an  offence
    for which he has been sentenced to a period  of  imprisonment  of  four
    years.  His claim should therefore be assessed under paragraphs 399 and
    399A of the Rules.  However, the appellant does not  benefit  from  the
    terms of those Rules - he is not in a genuine and  subsisting  paternal
    relationship with a child under the age of 18  nor  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a partner who is in Britain as  a  British
    citizen settled here or here with refugee leave to remain who has lived
    here for fifteen years.  I pause to state that the reality is that  the
    appellant is the boyfriend of  Ms  Assanoh  rather  than  the  fianc�e.
    There was no indication that they intend to get married, let alone that
    they could be described as being engaged - that is having  stated  that
    there would be a day which  they  would  get  married.   They  are  not
    partners in that they have never lived together.  The  reality  is,  it
    appears, that they were a boyfriend and  girlfriend  -  a  relationship
    which, given the appellant's age, would be appropriate.

58.  With regard to the provisions of paragraph 399A the appellant  is  aged
    21 but he has not spent at least half of his life  living  continuously
    in Britain immediately proceeding the date of the immigration decision.
     Moreover, I would emphasise that I  do  not  accept  that  he  has  no
    cultural or other ties with Nigeria.  The reality is that he  at  least
    has one relative - his grandmother - in Nigeria  and  his  family  have
    other contacts there - at the very least  those  whom  his  father  has
    sponsored for visits  could  surely  be  asked  to  look  out  for  the
    appellant.  His parents visited Nigeria on a number of occasions.  They
    are part of the Nigerian diaspora.  I simply do not believe  that  they
    do not have contacts there on which they could draw.  In  any  event  I
    would point out that the appellant is now aged 21 but has only lived in
    Britain since March 2004 and therefore can hardly be considered  to  be
    alienated from Nigerian society - it was in Nigeria  that  he  received
    his early education.

59.  It is clear, however, that the appellant cannot benefit from the  terms
    of the Rules save that the Rules  state  that:  "It  will  only  be  in
    exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation  will
    be outweighed by other factors".  As was indicated in the  judgment  in
    MF (Nigeria) that test is, in effect, akin to the issue of  whether  or
    not removal is a  disproportionate  interference  with  an  appellant's
    rights under Article 8 of the ECHR.  However, that exercise is informed
    by the importance that must be placed on the decision of the Government
    to institute the deportation regime in Section 32 of the 2007 Act.

60.  In his judgment in SS (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013]  EWCA  Civ  550  Laws  LJ
    stated:-

         "53.     ... An  Act  of  Parliament  is  anyway  to  be  specially
             respected; but all the more so when it declares policy of this
             kind. In this case, the policy is general and overarching.  It
             is circumscribed only by five carefully drawn  exceptions,  of
             which the first is violation of a person's  Convention/Refugee
             Convention rights. ... Clearly, Parliament in the 2007 Act has
             attached very great weight to the policy as a  well  justified
             imperative for the protection of the public and to reflect the
             public's proper condemnation of serious wrongdoers. Sedley  LJ
             was with respect right  to  state  that  'in  the  case  of  a
             "foreign criminal"  the  Act  places  in  the  proportionality
             scales a markedly greater weight than in other cases'.


         54.  I would draw particular attention to the  provision  contained
             in s.33(7): 'section 32(4) applies despite the application  of
             Exception  1...',  that  is  to  say,  a  foreign   criminal's
             deportation   remains   conducive   to   the    public    good
             notwithstanding his successful reliance on Article 8.  I  said
             at paragraph 46 that while the  authorities  demonstrate  that
             there is no rule of exceptionality for Article  8,  they  also
             clearly show that the more pressing  the  public  interest  in
             removal or deportation, the stronger must be the  claim  under
             Article 8 if it is to prevail.  The  pressing  nature  of  the
             public interest here is vividly informed by the fact  that  by
             Parliament's  express  declaration  the  public  interest   is
             injured if the criminal's deportation is not effected. Such  a
             result could in my judgment only be justified by a very strong
             claim indeed."

61.  The reality is, of course, that the judgement  in  SS  (Nigeria)  comes
    after a long line of cases starting with  the  judgment  in  N  (Kenya)
    [2004] EWCA Civ 1094 which emphasised the necessity of considering  the
    revulsion of the public against serious  crime.   The  judgment  in  DS
    (India)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  544  again  emphasised  the  necessity   of
    recognising the public abhorrence at serious crimes notwithstanding the
    likelihood that an offender might not reoffend.  As  Lord  Justice  Rix
    stated in paragraph 37 of that judgment:-

         "The public interest in deportation of  those  who  commit  serious
         crimes goes well beyond depriving the offender in question from the
         chance to re-offend in this country: it extends  to  deterring  and
         preventing  serious  crime  generally  and  to   upholding   public
         abhorrence of such offending."

62.  The First-tier Tribunal found that the  appellant  was  not  exercising
    family life with his family here. I do place weight,  however,  on  the
    fact  that  his  parents,  siblings  and  his  girlfriend   are   here.
    Notwithstanding the certificates which he has obtained while in  prison
    and the assertions of his father in his father's witness statement that
    the appellant took part in various activities at the church attended by
    the family, the appellant has nothing exceptional in his  private  life
    here such as to make deportation disproportionate - there is nothing to
    stop him attending a church in Nigeria or  taking  part  in  activities
    there.  I am, of course, aware of the fact that the appellant committed
    the index offence when he was aged 17, and was therefore  a  minor  and
    that he had entered Britain at the age of 12, but the reality is  that,
    unlike the appellant in Maslov, the appellant's index offence  was  the
    extremely serious offence of drug  dealing  for  which  he  received  a
    lengthy sentence which, as the judge stated, would have been longer had
    he been older.  Moreover, the reality  is  that  when  considering  the
    possibility of  the  appellant  re-offending  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    considered  that  the  risk  was  low  to  medium.   I  see  no  reason
    notwithstanding that he has completed the Inclusion Recovery  Programme
    and has a certificate in cannabis awareness,   why the appellant  would
    not now re-offend.  The one factor on which the Tribunal relied was the
    ability of the appellant's parents to look after him here and stop  him
    re-offending.  The reality is of course that they did not do so in  the
    past.  Indeed, it could possibly be considered that by removing him  to
    Nigeria away from his home area where he was involved in  drug  dealing
    might well mean that he would be far  less  likely  to  offend  in  the
    future.

63.  There are simply no factors of any weight  which  would  weigh  against
    the public interest in the deportation of this appellant who  has  been
    convicted of the serious offence  of  dealing  in  class  A  drugs  and
    therefore I find  that  his  removal  would  not  be  disproportionate.
    Accordingly therefore, having set aside the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal I remake this decision  and  dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal
    against the decision to deport.

Decision

This appeal is dismissed on immigration and human rights grounds.
