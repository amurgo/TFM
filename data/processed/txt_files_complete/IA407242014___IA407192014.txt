                                                                 Respondents


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr R Toal, Counsel, instructed by Wilson Solicitors
LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For the purposes of my decision I shall refer to the  parties  as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal. Thus the Secretary of State is the
    Respondent and Mr and Mrs  Aldawsari  are  once  more  the  Appellants.
    Given that the second Appellant is a dependent upon the first, I  shall
    simply refer to the latter as "the Appellant".

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Thomas (the judge), promulgated on 29 September 2015, in
    which she allowed the Appellants' appeals.  The appeals to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal had been against the Respondent's decision of 16  October
    2014, cancelling their leave to remain and thereby  refusing  leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom.  The basis of the Respondent's  decision  was
    an assertion that the Appellant  had  obtained  a  false  English  test
    certificate and had dishonestly used this certificate when applying for
    further leave.


 3. This is one of a number of cases involving the  English  language  test
    provider ETS.


Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appeals first came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Clarke  on  13
    January 2015.  The Respondent produced new evidence on  the  day.   The
    Appellants therefore sought and were granted an  adjournment.   Further
    directions were issued by  Judge  Clarke  on  that  day  requiring  the
    Respondent to use her "best endeavours"  to  provide  further  evidence
    relating to the allegation made against the first Appellant.


 5. The appeals came before the judge on 18 September 2015.  The directions
    made previously had not been complied  with.   The  evidence  from  the
    Respondent  relating  to  the  assertion  of  the  use  of  the   false
    certificate was as follows: witness statements from Ms R Collings, Mr P
    Millington, and Mr M Lister (none of whom appeared before  the  judge),
    and a source data printout naming the Appellant.

 6. Having set out the basis of the respective parties' submissions and the
    relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules,  namely  paragraphs  321A
    and 321(7A), the judge directed herself that in this case the burden of
    proof rested with the Respondent and the standard of proof was that  of
    a balance of probabilities.  It was for the Respondent  to  prove  that
    the Appellant or someone acting on his behalf had been dishonest in the
    use of what was said by the Respondent to be a false  English  language
    certificate.

 7. Passages from the witness statements of Ms Collings and  Mr  Millington
    are set out at paragraphs 19 and 20, and  at  paragraph  21  the  judge
    cites the source data print-out and states that:

         "...significantly there is no evidence from the person who produced
         this printout and no details of  the  information  upon  which  the
         decision was taken to invalidate the tests".

 8. In paragraph 22 the judge repeats the Respondent's assertion  that  the
    Appellant had employed a proxy test taker in  respect  of  the  English
    language test.  The judge then states:

         "There is however no evidence at all from ETS to substantiate  this
         or to show how this conclusion was reached.  There is  no  evidence
         of any voice verification results, electronic file or  analysis  of
         files  relating  to  this  Appellant  and  his  test.   It  is  not
         sufficient  to  simply  make  such  a  serious  statement  and  not
         substantiate it with any real and cogent evidence."


 9. At paragraph 23 the judge refers to the Appellant's inability  to  give
    detailed answers in an interview but comments that it remained for  the
    Respondent to discharge the burden of proof in the appeal  before  her.
    She concludes that that burden had not been discharged and goes  on  to
    say:

         "...there is simply no reliable evidence linking this Appellant  to
         the investigation detailed by the  witnesses  Ms  Collings  and  Mr
         Millington and explained by Mr Lister".


10. The appeals were therefore allowed under the Immigration Rules.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

11. The Respondent's grounds of appeal assert that the judge failed to give
    adequate reasons for her findings on a material matter.  Passages  from
    the statements of Ms Collings and Mr Millington are set out and then at
    paragraph 3 of the grounds it is stated:

         "It is clear that in order to be  categorised  as  invalid  on  the
         spreadsheet provided to the Home Office the case has to  have  gone
         through  a  computer  programme  analysing  speech  and  then   two
         independent  voice  analysts.  ...The  spreadsheet  identifies  the
         Appellant as having exercised deception.  It  links  him  with  the
         evidence of the witness statements."


12. Paragraph 5 asserts that "had the First-tier  Tribunal  properly  taken
    the evidence into account the First-tier Tribunal would have found that
    this is exactly what the documents assert and evidence".


13. The second ground of challenge relates  to  what  is  said  to  be  the
    application by the judge of an "impermissibly high standard of  proof",
    a  standard  which  was  "far  more  onerous"  than  the   balance   of
    probabilities.

14. Paragraph 8 asserts that in the present case the burden  of  proof  was
    "clearly discharged".

15. In granting permission Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Manuell
    commented that the reasoning of the judge appeared to  be  "thin",  and
    that the Appellant had not appeared to have tried to  substantiate  his
    own case.  The grant of permission is dated 2 February 2016.

The hearing before me

16. Ms Isherwood relied on the grounds and asserted that this was indeed  a
    reasons challenge.  She sought to rely on paragraph 20 in the  case  of
    Gazi [2015] UKUT 327 (IAC) where the expert Dr Harrison had, as she put
    it, agreed with the methodology of the ETS processes.   She  relied  on
    the source  data  sheet  and  submitted  that  there  was  insufficient
    reasoning by the judge in  respect  of  paragraphs  20  to  23  of  her
    decision.


17. Mr Toal acknowledged the  Appellant's  answers  in  his  interview  but
    emphasised that the burden in this case was on the Respondent to  prove
    her case.  The grounds of appeal relied on the  generic  evidence  from
    the three witnesses and the spreadsheet evidence only: no reliance  had
    been placed upon the  Appellant's  interview  answers  to  justify  the
    challenge to the judge's decision.  It was of note, Mr Toal  submitted,
    that passages referred to in the grounds of appeal  had  also  in  part
    been referred to by the judge herself in the decision at paragraphs  18
    and 19.  The judge clearly had relevant evidence in  mind  when  making
    her decision.  The judge had not found that the generic evidence was in
    itself unreliable, but she had found that it was not sufficient to show
    that this Appellant had been dishonest and had used a proxy test taker.
     The Respondent had been given an opportunity to adduce the  electronic
    files and analyst's voice recognition reports but had failed to do  so.
    The only response from the Respondent following the directions  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal was contained in paragraph 10 of  the  Respondent's
    letter dated 16 September 2015.  There was no evidence whatsoever as to
    any endeavours made by the Respondent in respect of the  ETS  evidence.
    The  judge  was,  Mr  Toal  submitted,  fully  entitled  to  reach  the
    conclusions she did in paragraphs 20 to 23.  Mr Toal read out paragraph
    20 of Gazi in its entirety and asked  me  to  carefully  consider  that
    passage as a whole.


18. In reply Ms Isherwood reconfirmed that  her  challenge  was  a  reasons
    challenge and not one of perversity.


Decision on error of law

19. At the hearing I announced my decision that in my view  there  were  no
    material errors of law in the judge's decision.  I now give my  reasons
    for that conclusion.


20. First, the judge correctly directed herself in law as to  the  location
    of the burden of proof, the relevant standard, and  the  need  to  show
    dishonesty (paragraph 17).

21. Second,  she  clearly  had  in  mind  all  of  the  evidence  from  the
    Respondent, such as it was.

22. Third, the judge was entitled to find at paragraph 21 that there was no
    evidence to support the production of the source data printout  or  the
    information upon which this information was based. It is a simple  fact
    that there was no such evidence before her relating  to  the  Appellant
    (as opposed to the generic position asserted in  the  untested  witness
    statements).

23. Fourth, the judge was fully entitled to find in paragraph 22 that there
    was no evidence at all from ETS to substantiate the serious  allegation
    that the language test has been taken by a proxy sitter.  The judge was
    clearly entitled to take into account the undisputed  fact  that  there
    were no voice verification results, no electronic  files  or  analyst's
    report relating to this particular Appellant,  despite  the  Respondent
    having had the opportunity (through the previous directions) to  adduce
    such evidence.  The reference by Ms Isherwood to paragraph 20  of  Gazi
    is  in  fact  rather  unhelpful  to  her  case.  Whilst   Dr   Harrison
    acknowledges  that  the  ETS  methodology  constituted  a   "reasonable
    approach" in principle, he raises a number of important caveats to this
    initial comments, none of which  were  addressed  by  evidence  in  the
    present case.

24. Fifth, it follows from what I have said above that the judge was  fully
    entitled to  conclude  that  it  was  simply  not  sufficient  for  the
    Respondent to make serious allegations without backing this up with any
    "real and cogent  evidence".   She  was  not  expressly  rejecting  the
    generic evidence, as far as that evidence went.  What she was doing  in
    my view is simply looking  at  the  case  before  her  and  reaching  a
    sustainable finding that the evidence was not sufficient  to  make  out
    the Respondent's case.

25. Sixth, in paragraph 23 the judge acknowledges the Appellant's interview
    answers but immediately goes on to correctly point out that the  burden
    rested with the Respondent, and it was not for the Appellant  to  prove
    or disprove any of the core issues in  the  appeal.   In  stating  that
    there was no reliable evidence linking  this  Appellant  with  the  ETS
    investigation as detailed in the generic statements of Ms Collings  and
    Mr Millington and as explained by  Mr  Lister,  the  judge  was  simply
    restating her view that the evidence as a whole was not  sufficient  to
    discharge the burden of proof.


26. Seventh, there is no merit in the challenge as regards the  appropriate
    standard of proof.  As I have said already, the judge directed  herself
    correctly at paragraph  17  and  the  reference  to  "real  and  cogent
    evidence" was nothing more than a recognition that whilst the  standard
    of proof was just that of a balance of probabilities the quality of the
    evidence produced by the Respondent was relevant given the  seriousness
    of the allegation against the Appellant.

27. So whilst Ms Isherwood has stated that this was a reasons challenge, in
    my view the judge has given perfectly adequate reasons based  upon  the
    limited evidence before her.

28. I would add this comment. Having looked at the grounds of  appeal  they
    appear to me more of  a  thinly  veiled  perversity  challenge  than  a
    reasons challenge given the recitation of  passages  from  the  generic
    witness statements of Ms Collings and Mr Millington and  the  assertion
    in the grounds, particularly at paragraphs 5, 6 and 8,  to  the  effect
    that if the judge had taken the view urged by the Respondent  then  she
    would have been bound to dismiss the Appellant's case.  In my view,  in
    cases where allegations of dishonesty are made, the Respondent  adduces
    generic evidence only and has not  taken  steps  to  produce  the  best
    possible evidence that might have been available to her, or has  failed
    to give any explanation as to why the best endeavours to obtain  better
    evidence have failed, it is likely that a judge  will  be  entitled  to
    conclude that the Respondent has not made out her case.

29. In light of the above the Respondent's appeal fails and the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal stands.
