                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Mensah promulgated on 5 August  2019  in  which  the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on  protection  grounds  but
        allowed the appeal pursuant to article 8 ECHR.
     2. Although the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  header  indicates  an
        anonymity direction was not made it is clear that such an order was
        made at [2] and [40] of the decision.



Background


     3. The appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh  born  on  1  January  1979,
        arrived in the United Kingdom on 20  September  2003.  He  did  not
        claim asylum until 2 January 2018. Having considered  the  evidence
        the Judge sets out findings of fact from [15] of the decision under
        challenge.
     4. The Judge accepts the psychiatric evidence that  the  appellant  is
        suffering from schizophrenia and a depressive disorder  leading  to
        the finding at [36 - 37] in the following terms:

             "36.     However, I do find given his poor mental  health  and
                  his conversion, he faces  very  significant  obstacles  to
                  integration into Bangladesh under 276  ADE  (iv).  He  has
                  been in the UK  for  15  years,  he  has  been  an  active
                  Jehovah's Witness for  about  1  ï¿½  years.  I  accept  his
                  behaviour both in terms of his religious activity and  his
                  mental health would make integration  extremely  difficult
                  and he would  face  stigma,  isolation  and  rejection.  I
                  accept this would impact upon his  mental  health  further
                  and given his  genuine  fears  of  return,  I  accept  the
                  doctors conclusions that he is reasonably likely to become
                  floridly psychotic, severely  depressed,  suffer  auditory
                  hallucinations and present a high risk of self-harm and/or
                  suicide.  I  accept  he  wouldn't  be   able   to   engage
                  appropriately with medical services and it  is  reasonably
                  likely his elderly parents will not possess the skills  to
                  assist him. I accept employment is not realistic in  those
                  circumstances.


             37.  Given the rules are said to reflect the public interest I
                  find his appeal also succeeds under article 8  on  account
                  of his private life. It is not proportionate to remove him
                  because he meets 276 ADE (iv). I allow  his  appeal  under
                  Article 8."

     5. There is no challenge by the respondent to the above decision.
     6. The appellant's protection claim is based on a real risk he  claims
        to face on return as a Jehovah's Witness. The Judge finds  at  [18]
        that there are potentially two factors which might  draw  attention
        to the appellant the first is if it was found he is a  convert  and
        will behave in a way that would draw attention  to  his  conversion
        through his religious behaviour and his mental health.
     7. In relation to the question of the appellant's conversion the Judge
        finds at [32 - 34]:

             "32.      I  accept  taking  all  the  evidence  together  the
                  appellant believes that  he  has  converted  to  become  a
                  Jehovah's Witness. In a sense it is irrelevant whether  he
                  is a genuine convert, or because of his  lack  of  insight
                  and irrational  thinking  he  genuinely  believes  he  has
                  converted; because the position on return is going  to  be
                  the same. If he believes he is a Jehovah's Witness then it
                  doesn't  matter  if  his  reasons   are   irrational   and
                  confusing. He will return with a genuine fear  because  of
                  his belief in his conversion and this will have the impact
                  as described by the Dr (as set out in detail above).


             33.  I also  accept  as  a  professed  convert  and  Jehovah's
                  Witness he would feel it necessary to evangelise and  this
                  would be unacceptable behaviour in a strict Muslim family.
                  Albeit, I am not satisfied there is any reliable  evidence
                  it is reasonably likely the  family  would  not  help  him
                  further.


             34.  Mr Farrell argued having mental health  problems  doesn't
                  mean a person cannot genuinely convert and I  accept  that
                  proposition.  However,  given  the  appellant's  lack   of
                  reliable  reasoning  for  converting   and   his   limited
                  knowledge of basic elements  of  Islam  and  Christianity,
                  there is a paucity  of  reliable  evidence  regarding  his
                  conversion.  This  would  normally   have   led   to   his
                  explanations being given negative weight  and  potentially
                  to his claim being rejected. I have taken  the  view  that
                  while they negate any rational reason for  conversion  and
                  this  potentially  could  have  led  to  his  claim  being
                  dismissed, given his mental health I don't  consider  this
                  negates whether he holds a genuine belief."

     8. At [33] the  Judge  confirms  her  acceptance  that  the  appellant
        genuinely believes he is a convert, that he would not be capable of
        engaging in appropriate treatment  in  Bangladesh  for  his  mental
        health,  will  feel  it  necessary  to  evangelise  which  will  be
        unacceptable behaviour in a Muslim family, and will be at high risk
        of suicide or self-harm, but dismissed the protection claim.
     9. The appellant sought permission to appeal asserting that the  Judge
        whilst clearly having considered the  expert  report  of  Dr  Hoque
        "inexplicably  ignored  the  overwhelming  bulk   of   the   expert
        evidence".
    10. The appellant argues that in his expert report Dr Hoque stated  the
        following:


          i. Although there are no explicit  laws  against  blasphemy,  the
             penal  code  does  criminalise  'acts  intended   to   outrage
             religious feelings' which can lead  to  2  years  imprisonment
             [31].
         ii. The appellant will not be prosecuted as long as  he  does  not
             publicly propagate his ideas and beliefs [30].
        iii. Extremist organisations may become aware  of  the  appellant's
             opinions and activities; if they do, the appellant's life will
             be in serious risk as a  perceived  apostate  and  convert  to
             Christianity [32].
         iv. Islamist  organisations  'pose  the  highest  threat'  to  the
             appellant's life and combined with the ubiquitous  taboo  that
             apostasy  invokes  will  make  the  appellants  residence   in
             Bangladesh untenable [32].
          v. The promotion of atheism  and  apostasy  in  Bangladesh  by  a
             person who was born a Muslim is a serious antisocial activity.
             If  the  appellant  openly  expresses  his  views,   he   will
             undoubtedly encounter problems from both the wider public  and
             the authorities [35].
         vi.  Islamist  organisations  pose  the  greatest  threat  to  the
             appellant's life [57].
        vii. Extremist Islamic organisations  are  part  of  the  political
             mainstream in Bangladesh;  such  organisations  or  individual
             members become aware of the appellant's renunciation of Islam,
             will become the target for extrajudicial killings [38].
       viii. Any public criticism of Islam leads to attacks on  the  charge
             of producing unIslamic works and opinions [39 - 40]
         ix. Since 2013, 25 people have been targeted and brutally  killed.
             The numbers targeted had  significantly  accelerated  in  2016
             [44].
          x. The government has come under intense  pressure  from  Islamic
             groups to  seek  out  and  reprimand  those  perceived  to  be
             spreading anti-Islamic polemic [48].
         xi. In 2016, the demographics of those killed for their  religious
             beliefs include not just those who were activists but  also  a
             tailor, a Sufi Muslim, a monk, a  shoe  trader,  a  priest,  a
             college teacher and a farmer [49].
        xii. Elements of the Islamic far right pose the biggest  threat  to
             the appellant [53].
       xiii. If the appellant were to  express  or  promote  his  views  in
             Bangladesh,  this  is  highly  likely  to  be  encountered  by
             extremist  Islamic  groups  or  their  affiliates.  In   those
             circumstances, the appellant is likely to face violence and/or
             fatal vigilante reprisals given the highly inflammatory nature
             of the appellant's views on Islam [54].
        xiv. Since 2017, there has been  an  increase  in  Islamic  attacks
             specifically on Christian converts [57].
         xv. Though much of the  population  is  religiously  tolerant  and
             there are people who describe themselves as agnostic, humanist
             and atheist, they do not encounter problems because 'they have
             not publicly defamed or disrespected Islam' [63].
        xvi. The only way in which the appellant can avoid  being  attacked
             is to adhere to conventional life  in  which  he  conforms  to
             inherently Islamic social parameters [64].
       xvii.  It  is  not  difficult  to  locate  people   in   Bangladesh,
             particularly those who behave in a  suspicious  or  unorthodox
             way [65].
      xviii. There is no sufficiency of protection [42, 51, 59].


    11. Permission to appeal was granted by a judge of the  Upper  Tribunal
        on the basis it  was  arguable  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  did  not
        properly consider the  risk  to  the  appellant  were  he,  as  was
        accepted, to seek to proselytise on return,  by  reference  to  the
        experts report at [57] to [58] and [64] to [65].
    12. At [58] Dr Hoque writes:

             "58.     Given these recent developments and communal tensions
                  pertaining  to  the  current  political  climate  in   the
                  country, [SMIHP] professed  fear  of  persecution  on  the
                  basis of his conversion to Christianity is  plausible  and
                  consistent with the  evidence  that  the  authorities  are
                  unable to provide protection to those who are perceived as
                  speaking or acting against Islam  from  Islamic  militants
                  currently operating within the country."

    13. At [64 - 65] Dr Hoque writes:

             "64.     On the other hand, concealing his  true  beliefs  may
                  pose a threat to [SMIHP] life in  the  long  term  if  the
                  curiosity of the locals pushes them to probe  him  on  his
                  political and religious beliefs. If [SMIHP] engages in any
                  form of  candid  discussion  with  any  practising  Muslim
                  regarding his beliefs, this may indeed provoke heated  and
                  violent reactions  not  just  by  those  involved  in  the
                  conversation, but also members  of  the  wider  community.
                  Moreover,  dissemination  of  his  beliefs  will   be   an
                  inevitable outcome of any conversation of this type, given
                  the gravity and highly controversial nature of  them.  The
                  only way [SMIHP] can prevent this scenario is if he  lives
                  a conventional  life,  conforming  to  overarching  social
                  parameters, which, in Bangladesh, are  inherently  Islamic
                  in essence.


             65.  Furthermore, it is not  difficult  to  locate  people  in
                  Bangladesh, particularly if individuals act in  suspicious
                  or unorthodox ways. Bangladesh is a communitarian  society
                  where social  participation  in  the  local  community  is
                  mandatory. Even if he is not initially recognised, [SMIHP]
                  distinct regional accent (Dhaka/Feni) will be  immediately
                  identified, and he  will  inevitably  be  asked  questions
                  regarding his ancestral home (desher bari). Reluctance  or
                  refusal to answer questions of  this  nature  will  arouse
                  suspicion. In such circumstances,  it  will  be  extremely
                  difficult for [SMIHP] to maintain his anonymity."


Error of law


    14. JW.Org in explaining who Jehovah's Witness  are  writes:  "We  come
        from hundreds of ethnic and language backgrounds, yet we are united
        by common goals. Above all, we want to honor Jehovah,  the  God  of
        the Bible and the Creator of all things. We do our best to  imitate
        Jesus Christ and are proud to be  called  Christians.  Each  of  us
        regularly spends time helping people  learn  about  the  Bible  and
        God's Kingdom. Because we witness, or talk, about Jehovah  God  and
        his Kingdom, we are known as Jehovah's Witnesses".
    15. Jehovah's Witnesses method of preaching is ordinarily by going door-
        to-door to people's homes on the basis  of  the  belief  that  that
        method of making disciples is  the  model  Jesus  gave  the  church
        (Matthew 10:7, 11-13) as well  as  the  example  of  first  century
        Christians who spread the Gospel by going from house to house (Acts
        5:42; 20:20). Jehovah's Witnesses  also  take  very  seriously  the
        'Great Commission' in Matthew 28: 19 to  take  the  gospel  to  all
        nations.
    16. Against this objectively verifiable background we have an appellant
        who has severe mental health issues who lacks  the  perception  and
        judgement to enable him to understand the real risk that exists  if
        he attempts to convert followers of Islam to Christianity; which he
        sees as his duty so to do.
    17. It is accepted there was no specific  examples  of  persecution  of
        followers of the Jehovah's Witness faith before the Judge, but  the
        organisation's own website consulted on 11 December  2019  confirms
        that in a population of 166,368,149 people in Bangladesh  only  303
        are described as Jehovah's Witness Ministers who teach  the  Bible,
        with only six congregations. As recognised by Mr  Diwncyz  this  is
        clearly a minority group.
    18. There is clear evidence that the appellant, as  a  genuine  convert
        who will attempt to preach and  convert  others  to  the  Christian
        faith. There is clear evidence that this is likely to create a real
        risk for the appellant, even if not immediately, as a result of his
        activities becoming known to either the Islamic extremists or those
        he is attempting to preach to; as a result of his views, words  and
        statements being seen as being contrary to the interest  of  Islam.
        The appellant himself is a convert from Islam to Christianity which
        also giving rise to a real risk as a result of it being  deemed  he
        is an apostate.
    19. I find to the lower standard applicable that a real  risk  is  made
        out. Dr Hoque finds there is no sufficiency of protection available
        to the appellant a point not disputed  by  the  respondent  on  the
        facts.
    20. The only way the appellant could arguably avoid such a risk is  not
        to attempt to preach or convert others contrary to his beliefs.  As
        the only reason for doing so would be to avoid persecution or  ill-
        treatment this will contravene established legal principles.
    21. As noted by the Judge,  the  fact  of  the  appellant's  conversion
        together with his mental health satisfies paragraph 276 ADE (iv) as
        amounting  to  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration   into
        Bangladesh. Such obstacles will obviously be the real risk of  harm
        as a result of his conversion and evangelising. Persecution or ill-
        treatment as a result of the appellant's  religious  activities  or
        views clearly engages the Refugee Convention.
    22. I find that in dismissing the  appellant's  protection  appeal  the
        Judge has erred in law and set aside that element of the  decision.
        I substitute a decision to allow the appellant's protection  appeal
        for the above reasons.

    23. The First-Tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is allowed on protection grounds, the  Judge's
        decision to allow the appeal pursuant to article  8  ECHR  being  a
        preserved finding.


   Anonymity.


    24. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


I make such order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure     (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
