                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Ameen Hussein Obadi Al-Karihi, date of birth 9.9.76, is a
    citizen of Yemen.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimshaw  promulgated  13.5.15,  allowing  on
    human rights grounds the claimant's appeal against the decision of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse entry clearance to the United Kingdom
    as a family visitor pursuant to paragraph 41 of the Immigration  Rules.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 28.4.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford granted permission to appeal on 23.7.15,
    pointing out that it is arguable that Judge Grimshaw may have erred  in
    conflating the finding  that  there  were  exceptional  and  compelling
    circumstances in the case with  a  finding  that  article  8  ECHR  was
    engaged in respect of family life.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 8.10.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I find that there was such error  of  law
    in the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    determination of Judge Grimshaw should be set aside  and  the  decision
    remade by dismissing the appeal.

 6. There was no attendance on behalf of the claimant. By  a  faxed  letter
    received by the  Tribunal  on  an  enquiry  as  to  why  there  was  no
    attendance, the claimant asked for the matter  to  be  decided  on  the
    papers, which is not possible, and made various submissions  were  made
    as to compelling circumstances, which I have considered and taken  into
    account. In the  circumstances,  I  decided  to  proceed  to  hear  the
    submissions of Mr Harrison.

 7. As Judge Grimshaw  was  aware  and  referenced  in  the  decision,  the
    claimant's rights of appeal are limited  to  the  grounds  set  out  in
    section  84(1)(c)  of  the   2002   Act,   namely   human   rights   or
    discrimination.

 8. It is clear that at �17  of  the  decision  Judge  Grimshaw  mistook  a
    purported  finding  that  there   are   "exceptional   and   compelling
    circumstances" with a finding that family life is engaged under article
    8.

 9. On the facts of this case, whilst the circumstances may be  compelling,
    given the poor health and prognosis of the sponsor, preventing him from
    travelling to visit the claimant in Yemen, those do not establish  that
    degree of family life between the claimant and the appellant  protected
    by article 8 ECHR. Family life within the meaning of article 8 will not
    normally exist between a parent and adult children and will not  do  so
    unless something more than normal emotional ties  exists.  The  judge's
    formulation at �14 that  such  relationships  do  not  normally  engage
    article 8 "unless the relationship is something out of the ordinary  or
    there is an unusual aspect to the relationship," is not  one  known  to
    the law. As the Court of Appeal held in Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ
    31, neither blood ties nor the concern and affection that ordinarily go
    with them are not enough by themselves to constitute family life. "Most
    of us have close relations of whom we are extremely fond  and  whom  we
    visit, or who visit us, from time to time; but none of us would say  on
    those grounds alone that we share a family life with them in any  sense
    capable of coming within the meaning and purpose of Article  8."  There
    has to exist a  degree  of  dependency  which  the  evidence  does  not
    demonstrate is present on the facts  of  this  case.  The  sponsor  has
    medical  circumstances  which  prevent  him  from  travelling  and  the
    circumstances may be compassionate, but that  does  not  create  family
    life. The sponsor lives in the UK and the appellant  has  a  family  of
    wife and 7 children in Yemen. It is difficult to understand  how  there
    can be that degree family life between them intended to be protected by
    article 8.

10. In the circumstances,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    manifestly flawed and cannot stand. There is no family  life  and  thus
    article 8 ECHR cannot assist  the  claimant.  The  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer cannot succeed and should  have
    been dismissed. This does not, of course,  prevent  the  claimant  from
    making a further application on compassionate grounds, taking  care  to
    address those concerns raised in the refusal decision.

Conclusions:

11. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
