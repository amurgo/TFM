For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with  permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins sitting at Hatton Cross on 12 December
    2013.  In  her  determination,  promulgated  on  5  January  2014,  she
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent
    made on 31 October 2013 to refuse to grant him further leave to  remain
    in the United Kingdom  on  the  basis  that  he  was  not  entitled  to
    recognition as a refugee and that his removal would not be in breach of
    the  United  Kingdom's  obligations  pursuant  to  the   Human   Rights
    Convention.

 2. The appellant's case is in summary that he is a citizen of  Afghanistan
    who faces persecution on return to Afghanistan.  His family  have  been
    targeted by the Taliban and he also faces problems from the  government
    on the basis that they would have an adverse attitude to him due to his
    brother being perceived to be with the Taliban.

 3. The respondent did not accept the appellant's case, nor for that matter
    did she accept  the  appellant's  claim  that  he  was  born  in  1998,
    accepting instead an assessment from Kent Social Services  that  he  is
    two years older than claimed.  Initially after his claim for asylum the
    respondent granted the appellant discretionary leave until 13 September
    2013, the age by which he would, on the basis of  the  age  assessment,
    have reached 17ï¿½ years of age.

 4. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Malins  disbelieved  everything  that  the
    appellant had said and did not accept the appellant's claim as  to  his
    age. She accepted the age assessment undertaken  Kent  County  Council,
    but does refer to the appellant in her determination as being an adult.

 5. The appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    That was granted on 30th January  2014  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Levin who stated:

         "Although  in  accordance  with  the  Kent  Social   Services   age
         assessment the appellant will  shortly  attain  his  18th  birthday
         given that his assessed date of birth of 13  March  2014  [that  is
         clearly an error] was estimated and not precise it is arguable that
         the judge erred in law in treating the appellant as an adult and/or
         failing to give her reasons for so doing.  It is also arguable that
         the judge's adverse credibility findings generally flowed from  her
         adverse credibility finding in  relation  to  the  appellant's  age
         thereby tainting her determination as a whole."

 6. The respondent replied to that by way of a letter pursuant to  Rule  24
    dated 12 February 2014 in which it is asserted  that,  considering  the
    entirety of the age assessment report and the judge's own experience at
    the hearing of the appellant's behaviour, demeanour and appearance,  it
    was arguable that it was open to her to find that he  was  in  fact  an
    adult and she was entitled to treat him as such.

 7. When the matter came before me, I heard submissions from Ms  Mellon  on
    behalf of the appellant and Ms Everett on behalf of  the  Secretary  of
    State.  Ms Mellon accepted that the strongest of the  five  grounds  of
    appeal on which permission was granted was that the judge had erred  in
    that while she appears to accept the age assessment  from  Kent  Social
    Services stating that he is 17, she then proceeded to treat him  as  an
    adult  as  is  clear  from  her  finding  at  paragraph  14(f)  of  her
    determination.

 8. There is a significant difficulty in the judge's determination in  that
    while accepting the age assessment in full (and  thus  that  he  was  a
    minor) she has then gone on to say that the appellant is now an  adult.
    There is a clear conflict here.  Whilst it would have been open to  the
    judge to say that she did not accept the age assessment and to find  on
    the basis of the evidence before her that the appellant was not 18,  it
    cannot be discerned from the determination that that is what she did.

 9. I have considered whether the judge's reference to the appellant  being
    an adult was simply a slip but I am not satisfied that referring to the
    appellant as now being an adult could, in the context in  which  it  is
    expressed, be a slip on the part of the judge.

10. Taking at the determination as a whole, it  is  clear  that  the  judge
    found the appellant's age to be  a  matter  central  to  assessing  his
    credibility.  The inconsistency in the findings as to whether he was  a
    minor or whether he was an adult, undermines the  credibility  findings
    to the extent that it is material.  On that basis  the  error  is  such
    that the determination does need to be set aside.

11. Given the nature of the error which undermines the credibility findings
    and thus many of the findings of fact, it will be  necessary  for  this
    matter to be reheard and for a fresh determination on all issues and on
    that basis, bearing in mind the Procedure Rules as well as  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement, it is appropriate for this matter to be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  determination  on  all
    issues.



SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

    1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error of law and I set it aside.

    2. The appeal is remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
       determination on all issues. None of the findings  of  fact  in  the
       determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins are preserved.
