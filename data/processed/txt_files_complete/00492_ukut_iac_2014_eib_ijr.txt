                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

JUDGE JORDAN:  In the substantive hearing of this application  for  judicial
    review, following the grant of  permission,  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Gleeson, the applicant was born on 27  April  1975.   She  entered  the
    United Kingdom in February 2002 with a student visa.  She was then aged
    27.  During a period of extant student leave she sought  further  leave
    to remain on the basis of her medical condition - she suffers from  HIV
    Aids - but that was refused and her medical condition is really largely
    irrelevant to the circumstances with which I now have to deal.  Suffice
    it to say that further leave was  granted  to  25  October  2010  as  a
    student.  It appears to me clear that, at a time prior  to  25  October
    2010, it would have been open  to  the  applicant  to  make  a  further
    application for leave.  Such an application was open to her because she
    had been offered a postgraduate degree  leading  to  a  Masters  degree
    which was capable at any rate of falling within the  Immigration  Rules
    and would have permitted her to extend her leave.  It is impossible  to
    say what then would have happened.

 2. On 27 May 2010, that is  some  five  months  before  her  extant  leave
    expired, a letter was sent dated 27 May 2010 which was under the legacy
    programme.  The letter described in a  form  with  which  we  are  very
    familiar the legacy programme that was  dealing  with  the  backlog  of
    older  asylum  applications  which  were  being  handled  by  the  Case
    Resolution Directorate, the CRD.  It referred to the fact that her case
    was under active consideration under that  head  and  that  she  should
    provide a series of documents including photographs, identity documents
    and information about  her  private  and  family  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 3. That letter, it is accepted, was wholly  misconceived.   There  was  no
    outstanding asylum  claim  and  there  was  no  basis  upon  which  the
    applicant fell within the legacy  provisions.   However,  she  complied
    with the requirements of that letter and provided the information  that
    was sought.  She was however aware of the  expiration  of  her  student
    leave  and  the  fact  that  she  had  got   outstanding   offers   for
    continuation.  Accordingly, she wrote on  4  October  2010  asking  the
    Secretary of State what should happen because she needed  to  know  her
    position prior to the expiration of her leave on 25 October 2010.

 4. There then followed a flurry  of  activity  set  out  in  the  skeleton
    argument in the form of further correspondence.  It included  a  letter
    at page 163 dated 12 January 2011 at which  point  further  information
    was sought by the Secretary of State with which the applicant complied.
     It is not however surprising, perhaps, that  on  14  March  2011  this
    wholly  inappropriate  application  under  the  legacy  programme   was
    refused.  By that stage the applicant's further leave had expired.

 5. Further representations were made outside the Immigration Rules  and  a
    decision was made on  16  July  2013  which  is  the  subject  of  this
    application.  That letter was in the  circumstances  of  this  case  an
    inappropriate response to the situation.  It was a classic example of a
    tick box exercise applying the Immigration Rules by one who had applied
    outside them by reference to Article 8.   Consideration  was  given  to
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and not surprisingly  answers
    to the tick boxes  were  provided  in  the  negative.   Of  course  the
    applicant had not lived continuously in the UK  for  twenty  years;  of
    course she did not comply with the requirements of one  who  was  under
    the age of 18; of course she did not comply with  the  requirements  of
    one who was aged between the age of 18 and 25.  Accordingly, the answer
    that was provided by  reference  solely  to  these  considerations  was
    inevitably going to be an outright refusal.

 6. The letter then went on to  consider  whether  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances.  That was a proper  matter  to  be  raised  because  any
    application made under the Immigration  Rules  required  the  decision-
    maker also to consider the overall circumstances and whether there  was
    a requirement for further consideration not arising from the  formulaic
    considerations to which I have already  referred.   The  decision-maker
    said,

    "It has  also  been  considered  whether  your  application  raises  or
    contains any exceptional circumstances which consistent with the  right
    to respect for private and family life contained in Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights might warrant consideration by  the
    Secretary of State of a grant of leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    outside the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  It has been decided
    that it does not."

 7. The sole consideration therefore of whether the  applicant's  case  had
    been properly considered was contained  in  the  words,  'It  has  been
    decided that it does not.' This is not reasoning at all  but  simply  a
    conclusion that there was nothing exceptional in the applicant's  case.
    That might well have been an appropriate response in many  cases  where
    the applicant's immigration history and her private and family life did
    not merit any more than such a cursory  examination.   However  in  the
    circumstances of this case and in particular the fact that  there  were
    some 50 pages of documentary material which had been submitted  dealing
    with the overall circumstances of the case, no reference  was  made  to
    this additional material nor to the fact, as I have pointed  out,  that
    there was prior consideration under the legacy programme which may have
    had consequences for the applicant.

 8. It is said by Mr Moules on behalf of the Secretary of State that  there
    had been prior consideration of her medical condition in a letter which
    was dated 2004 but there are a number of difficulties with that.  First
    of all the application was not primarily advanced on the basis  of  her
    medical condition.  Secondly, that letter had been  written  some  nine
    years before.  Thirdly, inevitably, it did not take  into  account  the
    additional written material and fourthly, and most  importantly,  there
    is no suggestion that  that  letter  was  taken  into  account  by  the
    decision-maker in 2013 and it is simply impossible to say that  it  was
    taken into account when it features in a large bundle of material, none
    of which was taken into account in the course of the July letter.  I am
    therefore entirely satisfied that the letter of 17  July  2013  was  an
    unlawful decision because it failed to grapple with the  material  that
    had been provided in support of the application.

 9. That in many cases would be sufficient to dispose of an application for
    judicial review because it would require the Secretary of State to make
    a fresh and lawful decision.

10. However, in the circumstances of this case, there is a further decision
    made on 12 June 2014 which has to come into play.  It  is  as  well  to
    point out the context in which that letter was written.  It was written
    as a response to the challenge which had been mounted by the  applicant
    in the judicial review proceedings and which was  an  attempt  to  make
    good the deficiencies in the July 2013 letter.  It is of course open to
    the Secretary of State to acknowledge that an earlier decision is wrong
    and to give proper consideration to the relevant  factors.   That  does
    not of course make the earlier decision of July 2013  any  more  lawful
    but it operates to suggest that  there  should  be  no  relief  in  the
    judicial review proceedings because such relief would only result in  a
    fresh and lawful decision being made and, since one has been  made,  it
    renders the judicial review unnecessary.  It therefore goes  to  relief
    rather than the lawfulness of the challenged decision.

11. In this case the letter of 12 June 2014 is barely anything more than  a
    complete repetition of the unlawful decision that had been made  on  17
    July 2013.  It refers to the applicant's medical condition and  Article
    3.  It refers to the consideration of family life.  It  refers  to  the
    application of paragraph 276ADE.   It  goes  through  the  same  futile
    consideration of factors which did  not  in  any  sense  apply  to  the
    applicant's case and then reaches the same decision that was inevitably
    going to be reached on an application of those principles, namely  that
    the applicant did not qualify.

12. Consideration is then given to exceptional circumstances.   As  I  have
    initially pointed out in relation to the letter of 17  July  2013  that
    consideration was wholly deficient.  It was encapsulated  in  a  single
    sentence which did not reflect the matters which the Secretary of State
    was being asked to consider.  Here in the letter of June 2014 there  is
    a self-direction as to  what  exceptional  means.   The  self-direction
    cannot be faulted in that it relies upon the developed case law and the
    Secretary  of  State's  own   policy   in   relation   to   exceptional
    circumstances.   However,  it  wholly  fails  to   grapple   with   the
    application  which  was  made  by  the  applicant  and  which  required
    consideration.  For this reason I am satisfied that the  letter  of  12
    June 2014 does not make good the deficiencies of that of 17  July  2013
    and consequently the Secretary of State is  not  able  to  assert  that
    relief should not be granted because of it.

13. In the course of submissions this morning a  great  deal  of  time  was
    taken seeking to exculpate the Secretary of State from  the  disastrous
    course of action initiated by her in the letter of 27 May 2010 in which
    she erroneously stated that the application was to be considered  under
    the legacy programme.  For reasons that I have already stated there was
    no question of this application being properly treated as a case coming
    within the legacy programme.  There was no asylum claim.   There  never
    had been an asylum claim and none  has  ever  been  suggested.   It  is
    therefore said by the Secretary of State that, although the  respondent
    set this hare going, no consequences of any type should  be  attributed
    to it because the decision that was subsequently made on 14 March  2011
    was inevitable.  I entirely agree that the Secretary of State  made  an
    erroneous  decision  to  pursue  a  course  of  action  which  had   no
    application.  She pursued that erroneous approach  by  seeking  further
    information on 12 January 2011.  Accordingly, it is easy  to  see  that
    the legacy application was wholly without  any  legitimate  expectation
    that it would produce a result in favour of the applicant.

14. However this misses the point because by embarking upon this course  of
    action, the Secretary of State  appeared  to  be  suggesting  that  the
    applicant should rely upon that application, the legacy  programme,  in
    order to pursue her right to further leave  to  remain.   At  the  same
    time, so the respondent argues, the applicant was not absolved from her
    duty to make a further application in the  knowledge  that  her  extant
    leave would expire on 25 October 2010.

15. I am utterly unpersuaded that the applicant was not entirely  justified
    in complying with the requirements of the Secretary  of  State  written
    formally to her that she should provide additional documents which,  if
    they were supplied in the way that was sought, would have  resulted  in
    her being granted leave.  At least, if not absolutely  guaranteed  that
    she would have leave, this was a course of action that the Secretary of
    State was pursuing in order to resolve her case.  It does not  seem  to
    me that it  is  realistic  that  this  applicant  who  is  not  legally
    represented was to say to the respondent :

         "You have made a glaring and  most  obvious  error  and  I  do  not
         propose to comply with any of the requirements that you are  making
         in your letter of 4 October 2010 and furthermore, when  you  repeat
         those requirements in your 12 January  2011  letter,  I  intend  to
         disregard them entirely."

    What an ordinary applicant will do when confronted with a  request  for
    information which appears to  be  nonsensical  is  to  comply  with  it
    insofar as she is able.  The point that the Secretary of  State  misses
    in my judgment is that this then had consequences.

16. The applicant had already been provided  with  an  offer  to  pursue  a
    course of further education which she knew was in jeopardy because  she
    had not been granted, further leave to remain.   For  the  purposes  of
    this application I am persuaded that there is  a  good  case  that  she
    would have been granted that application, had it been  made.   She  was
    diverted from making that application by the hare that was set  running
    by the Secretary of State in treating this as a legacy application  and
    by the time the application was decided  against  her,  her  leave  had
    expired and she had become an overstayer.

17. It is not as if she was inactive because on  4  October  2010  she  had
    expressly raised the problem with the Secretary of State to  which  she
    had not received a reply.  This is all significant  material  that  the
    Secretary of State was bound to take into account when  she  considered
    the case on 16/17 July 2013.  If the letter itself of 16/17  July  2013
    was inadequate because it did not deal with the 50  pages  of  material
    that had been provided, it was certainly inadequate insofar as  it  did
    not deal with the circumstances which I have set out which were  argued
    by the applicant in her application.  It follows that the letter of  12
    June 2014 which sought to make good the deficiencies  of  July  of  the
    previous year was in itself inadequate to counter the  application  for
    judicial review and does not make out a  case  that  relief  should  be
    refused because a lawful decision has post-dated  the  application  for
    judicial review.  Accordingly, I grant  the  application  for  judicial
    review.

18. I set aside the decision of July 2013.

19. I summarily assess costs in the sum of �6,925.  ~~~~0~~~~
