For the Appellant:     No attendance
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Scott dated the 10th May 2015, but promulgated  on  the
      14th May 2015, in which he  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  under
      paragraph 245CA of the Immigration Rules and under Article  8  of  the
      ECHR, on human rights grounds.

   2. Within the Grounds of Appeal it is submitted that:

    "1)    The Home Office Respondent did not turn up  on  the  27th  March
    2015 for the hearing.

    2)     The Judge did not have enough evidence to work with, because  no
    correspondence was sent to the judge prior to the hearing date  by  the
    Home Office. He had to rely on the  limited  document  I  had  which  I
    believe was not enough to get the desired reply.

    3)     On these  grounds  I  believe  my  human  right  was  not  fully
    considered."

   3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Hollingworth on the 23rd July 2015 on the basis  that  the  Judge  had
      referred to the Appellant submitting a large bundle  of  papers  which
      had  been  returned  to  her  the   previous   day   by   her   former
      representatives, which was said to  include  the  Home  Office  appeal
      bundle sent to her in October 2014. The Judge had continued by stating
      that the Tribunal file contained no Respondent's bundle but  with  the
      Appellant's consent the Judge retained those papers and  he  had  duly
      considered them. Judge Hollingworth found that on  the  basis  of  the
      wording employed by the Judge at paragraph 9 it  was  unclear  whether
      the original Home Office bundle was available to the Judge or not  and
      that the Appellant was entitled to  proceed  on  the  basis  that  the
      Respondent would make available to the Judge all  those  papers  which
      have been submitted in association with her application  and  that  an
      arguable error of law had occurred.

   4. In the Respondent's Rule 24 reply it is  argued  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge directed himself appropriately and that  it  was  clear
      that the Judge did have access to all of the relevant papers and  that
      the Respondent's bundle was available via the Appellant. It is  argued
      that the clear finding at paragraph 10 meant that the Appellant  could
      not succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  the  Judge  had
      considered that the refusal of the  Appellant's  application  was  not
      such as to engage Article 8, which it was argued was open to him.

   5. It was on this basis that the  appeal  came  before  me  on  the  23rd
      November 2015. The case was listed for hearing at 2 p.m. and a  Notice
      of Hearing was sent to the Appellant at her home address  on  the  5th
      November 2015, by first class post,  notifying  her  that  the  appeal
      would be heard on Monday 23rd November 2015  at  2:00  p.m.  at  Field
      House, 15 Breams Buildings, London, EC4A 1DZ. However, by  2:40  p.m.,
      no one had attended on behalf of the Appellant, nor had the  Appellant
      herself attended. I noted that there was no representative or  sponsor
      marked on the file. No explanation had been given for the  Appellant's
      non-attendance, and no request had been sent to  the  Tribunal  asking
      for an adjournment. My clerk also checked to  ensure  that  there  had
      been no notification sent to the  Tribunal  regarding  any  change  of
      address on behalf of the Appellant, and a tannoy was put out to ensure
      that she was not present  somewhere  else  within  the  building.  The
      tannoy was not responded to.

   6. In such circumstances, I was satisfied on the balance of probabilities
      that the Appellant had been notified of the hearing, having been  sent
      the Notice of Hearing by first class post on the  5th  November  2014,
      some 18 days before the hearing was due to take  place  today  on  the
      23rd November 2015, or that reasonable steps had been taken to  notify
      the Appellant of the hearing. I further consider that it  was  in  the
      interest of justice to proceed with the hearing in the absence of  the
      Appellant, given the lack  of  any  explanation  for  her  failure  to
      attend, despite having been notified of the hearing.

   7. I therefore heard  submissions  from  Mr  Bramble  on  behalf  of  the
      Respondent. He submitted that it is  clear  that  in  fact  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Scott at [9] of his decision, had made  it  clear  that
      the Appellant had handed up the Home Office bundle which had been sent
      to her in October 2014 which he had retained and duly  considered  and
      that therefore all of the requisite documentation had  been  submitted
      up to the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  despite  the  absence  of  the
      Respondent at that hearing. Mr Bramble submitted that the findings  of
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge regarding the Appellant not  being  able
      to meet the requirements of paragraph 245 CA of the Immigration  Rules
      (since deleted) were correct, in that in order to be able  to  qualify
      for Leave under paragraph 245 CA, the Appellant must have had or  have
      been last granted entry clearance, Leave to Enter or Remain, as a Tier
      1 (General) Migrant: a Highly Skilled Migrant; a writer,  composer  or
      artist; or as a self-employed Lawyer. The Appellant in this  case,  as
      was stated by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at [11] had  been  granted
      Leave to Remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant, so  that  she  could
      not fall into any other relevant categories.

   8. However, Mr Bramble did indicate that there may be  an  error  in  the
      manner in  which  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Scott  dealt  with  the
      question of Human Rights under Article 8, in that  he  submitted  that
      the Judge simply set out the 5 stage  test  in  Razgar  but  had  then
      failed to set out whether in fact the Appellant did have a  family  or
      private life in the UK and had simply stated "having done  so,  I  can
      find no basis for holding that the Appellant's  removal  would  be  an
      interference with her right to respect  for  her  private  and  family
      life. I conclude, therefore, that the appeal on this ground  fails  at
      the first Razgar question". He further considered that  the  reasoning
      of the Judge in  this  regard  was  inadequate.  However,  Mr  Bramble
      submitted that even though there was a possible error in the way  that
      the Judge had considered Article 8, it  was  immaterial  and  did  not
      amount to a material error such as  to  set  aside  the  decision.  He
      argued that it had been clear from the evidence recorded by First-tier
      Tribunal Judge  Scott  at  [8]  and  [9]  that  the  Appellant  simply
      considered herself to be a Highly Skilled person who thought that  she
      would be allowed to switch into the Tier 1 (General) category and that
      she had worked and studied in the country and  wanted  the  chance  to
      continue what she started and to be the professional she  was  trained
      to be. However, Mr Bramble argued that this was insufficient to enable
      her to swap  categories  under  paragraph  245  CA  and  it  was  also
      insufficient to render the decision  taken  disproportionate  for  the
      purposes of the fifth stage of the Razgar  test.  On  the  basis  that
      there was no material error of  law,  he  submitted  that  the  appeal
      should be dismissed if I was not minded to adjourn the  appeal,  given
      the Appellant's non-attendance.

My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

   9. Although the Respondent did not attend at the hearing  of  the  First-
      tier Tribunal appeal on the 27th March 2015, I find that  the  wording
      of First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott  at  [9]  is  perfectly  clear.  At
      paragraph  9  First-tier  Tribunal  Scott  stated  specifically   "the
      Appellant submitted a large bundle of papers which had  been  returned
      to her the previous day by her  former  representative.  Those  papers
      included the Home Office appeal  bundle  which  was  sent  to  her  in
      October 2014. The Tribunal file contains no Respondent's bundle.  With
      the Appellant's consent, I retained those papers and  duly  considered
      them". This paragraph makes  it  clear  that  although  there  was  no
      Respondent's bundle on file, the  Appellant  had  been  sent  the  day
      before by her former representatives, the Home Office  appeal  bundle,
      which had been sent to the Appellant in October 2014. This  bundle  is
      on the file. This was a voluminous bundle and did contain all  of  the
      documents and associated  attachments  initiated  from  the  Appellant
      apart from the appeal form and included all of  her  bank  statements,
      online purchases, purchase documentation, payslips, investment account
      letters and the original decision.

  10. The fact is that the Judge was handed that bundle by the Appellant  at
      the hearing which he retained and duly considered as stated by him  at
      [9]. It did not have to be handed up by  the  Respondent,  as  it  was
      handed up by the Appellant and duly considered. There is  no  evidence
      within the Grounds of Appeal as to any further  documents  which  were
      not contained within that bundle which in fact had been  submitted  by
      the Appellant to the Respondent that were relevant to her claim  under
      Article 8 or under the Immigration Rules. It is also  clear  that  she
      could not meet the requirements of the Rules in any event, as she  was
      not within the required category of  persons  who  could  qualify  for
      Leave under paragraph 245 CA, she having previously  had  leave  as  a
      Tier  1  (Post-Study)  Migrant.  Her  appeal  was  therefore  properly
      rejected under the Immigration Rules.

  11. Her appeal then fell to be considered on Article 8 grounds, the  Judge
      having properly found that she could not succeed under the Immigration
      Rules. There is no  evidence  before  me  that  as  a  result  of  the
      Appellant handing up the Respondent's bundle as opposed to  it  having
      been submitted by the Respondent herself,  that  this  actually  meant
      that there was any documentation not considered  by  the  Judge  which
      would have otherwise been relevant to the appeal. I find that  all  of
      the relevant evidence within the Respondent's bundle was handed up  by
      the Appellant at the appeal hearing and  that  the  Judge  fully  took
      account of all of the relevant evidence.

  12. However, I do find that the Appellant's human rights  were  not  fully
      and properly considered by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Scott.  Although
      Judge Scott having dismissed the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules
      went  on  to  consider  the  case  on  Human  Rights  outside  of  the
      Immigration Rules and had set out the 5 stage test  in  Razgar  [2004]
      UKHL 27 he then simply stated " Having done so, I can  find  no  basis
      for holding the Appellant's removal would be an interference with  her
      right to  respect  for  her  private  and  family  life.  I  conclude,
      therefore, that the appeal on this ground fails at  the  first  Razgar
      question". This finding by First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott is  unclear
      as to whether or not in fact the Appellant actually had any private or
      family life in the UK and is inadequately reasoned as to the  findings
      made. Insufficient  reasons  are  given  in  respect  thereof  and  an
      inadequate consideration was given to this aspect of the appeal.

  13. However, from the file there was also  no  Appellant's  bundle  before
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott and the extent  of  the  documentation
      that he had was the Respondent's bundle handed up  by  the  Appellant.
      Significantly, there was  no  statement  from  the  Appellant  and  no
      evidence before the First-tier Tribunal Judge of her having any family
      in the UK. Further, although as First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott  found
      the Appellant had arrived in the UK in  February  2011  as  a  Tier  4
      (General) Student Migrant and was subsequently granted Leave to Remain
      as a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant until the 15th August 2014  when  she
      then applied on the 14th August 2014 for Leave to Remain as a  Tier  1
      (General) Migrant, that was the extent of her time in the  UK,  namely
      just over 4 years as at the date of the decision.  The  only  evidence
      recorded by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Scott  from  the  Appellant  in
      respect of her oral evidence, which  accords  with  his  note  of  the
      evidence given by her at [8] was that she  considered  herself  to  be
      highly skilled and thought that she will be allowed to switch into the
      Tier 1 (General) Migrant category and that she had worked and  studied
      in this country and wanted the chance to continue what she had started
      and to be the professional she was trained to be. That was the  extent
      of her oral evidence regarding her human rights under Article 8.

  14. Without any evidence of the Appellant having a family in the UK, there
      could be no breach of any right to a family life in the  UK,  and  the
      issue therefore simply became whether  or  not  the  decision  was  in
      breach of her right to private life. In this regard  it  was  relevant
      that the Appellant simply gave evidence that she had been working  and
      studying in the UK and wanted  effectively  the  chance  to  continue.
      However, it is clear that she had been studying and working in the  UK
      under the terms of the previous visas that she had been  granted,  and
      those visas had simply come to an end. She not being in a position  to
      swap categories under paragraph 245 CA, there is no  further  evidence
      from the Appellant as to why the decision taken was  disproportionate.
      Appellants do not simply have the right to continue working in the  UK
      after the period of their visas have expired.  There  is  no  specific
      right to work in the UK, for there to be a breach of human  rights  in
      respect of private life, what is necessary to establish  is  that  the
      Appellant does have a private life in terms of  the  relationships  in
      terms of friendships etc.  and  activities  undertaken  by  her  which
      constitute private life. No evidence was given  by  the  Appellant  in
      this regard, simply that she wished to carry on working and to be  the
      professional she was trained to be. Having been in  the  UK  for  four
      years she would have formed  some  private  life,  but  there  was  no
      evidence as to the quality or nature of that private life.

  15. It is also relevant that although the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
      failed to consider Sections 117 A-D of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002, that in respect of her earnings the Appellant was
      earning �346.76 net per week, being �18,021.12 per year net, such that
      she would be self-sufficient, and given the Appellant was from Nigeria
      and gave evidence in English, that she would have been able  to  speak
      English and would therefore be in a position to integrate into society
      and be self-sufficient.

  16. However, in light of the lack of  evidence  regarding  her  family  or
      private life in the  UK,  but  simply  evidence  that  she  wished  to
      continue working after the end  of  her  visa  period,  there  was  no
      evidence before the First-tier Tribunal Judge such as to mean that the
      Judge would have been in a position to find that the decision  reached
      was disproportionate  to  the  legitimate  public  aim  sought  to  be
      achieved of maintaining an effective immigration control and  for  the
      protection of the rights  and  freedoms  of  others.  Given  that  the
      Appellant's human rights claims would therefore have been dismissed in
      any event on the decision that there was no evidence that the decision
      taken was disproportionate to the legitimate public aims end sought to
      be achieved, the error of First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott in  the  way
      that he considered the Article 8  issue  outside  of  the  Immigration
      Rules was not material. Given that the error in this  regard  was  not
      material, and there being no material error of law,  the  decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott is maintained.

  17. However, even if I am wrong in this regard and there  was  a  material
      error and I had gone on to consider remaking  the  decision,  again  I
      would have found that the Appellant had not proved that  she  had  any
      family in the UK and that other than her desire to  continue  working,
      she had not proved what private life she had in  the  UK  such  as  to
      render the decision disproportionate to the legitimate public  end  of
      maintaining the protection of the rights and  freedoms  of  others  by
      ensuring that those whose visas have finished, return home, and  would
      have so found, even bearing in mind that fact that  the  Appellant  is
      self-sufficient and able to speak English for the purposes of  Section
      117  A-D  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act   2002.
      Therefore, even if I had been deciding the appeal myself on a remaking
      of the decision under Article 8 I would have dismissed the Appellant's
      appeal as the decision taken was proportionate.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott does not contain a  material
error of law and is maintained;

No anonymity direction was  sought  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  no  such
direction was sought before me. No such order was made.
