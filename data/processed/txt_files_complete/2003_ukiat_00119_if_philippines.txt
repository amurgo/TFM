                                     and

                    The Entry Clearance Officer at Manila
                                                                  Respondent

For the claimant: Mr P Warburton, IAS
For the Secretary of State:  Mr G. Phillips, HOPO

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of the Philippines who appeals against the
      decision of an adjudicator, Mr W.E. Handbury following the hearing  on
      17 January 2003 where he dismissed the claimant's appeal  against  the
      decision of the Entry  Clearance  Officer  at  Manila  to  refuse  the
      claimant's application for leave to enter the United Kingdom  for  the
      purposes of settlement.

   2. The claimant was born on 28 November 1920 and is 82  years  old.   Her
      husband died in 1998 and, since that time,  she  has  lived  with  her
      daughter Thelma in the Philippines where  she  has  spent  her  entire
      life.  She has another daughter, Mrs Milagros Exon, the  sponsor,  who
      is  a  married  woman,  a  British  citizen,  although  born  in   the
      Philippines.  She lives in Eastbourne with her family.

   3. The application fell to be considered under the terms of paragraph 317
      of HC 395.  There was only one issue before the adjudicator  and  that
      was whether the claimant  was  mainly  dependent  financially  on  her
      daughter, Mrs Exon, in United Kingdom.

   4. "Financially" in the words of the sub-paragraph means money or money's
      worth, and someone whose needs for accommodation, clothing,  food  and
      other necessities, including social comfort and support  in  old  age,
      are met by another is financially dependent on that  person.   In  the
      case of the claimant, she lives with Thelma, who is 50  years  of  age
      and has three children.  They live in a house that is  only  partially
      completed.  Her sole source of income is from a  sari-sari  shop  that
      produces about 200 pesos per week.  In a witness statement produced by
      her on 8 January 2003 she stated that it was barely enough to live  on
      and not enough to pay for the upkeep of her mother.   Jesusa,  one  of
      her sons, also made a statement to the effect that  he  is  a  college
      student and cannot contribute financially towards the financial  needs
      of his grandmother.

   5. In the course of paragraph 7 of  his  determination,  the  adjudicator
      relied upon the fact that the claimant was the owner of  a  fish  pond
      that produced an income of 100,000 pesos a year.  It is now clear that
      the adjudicator misunderstood the position, almost  certainly  because
      the claimant, who is somewhat confused, gave misleading answers to the
      Entry  Clearance  Officer  during  the  course   of   her   interview.
      Documentary evidence was produced by the sponsor and  her  husband  to
      establish that the fish pond is leased to the sponsor for 60,000 pesos
      a year.  The income from it belongs to the sponsor,  although  it  has
      not made money in the last couple of years.  The sponsor gave evidence
      to this effect to the adjudicator.  The adjudicator found the  sponsor
      and her husband to be truthful witnesses.

   6. The sponsor provides the claimant with considerable financial support.
       The adjudicator found that this  amounted  to  ï¿½1500.   However,  the
      adjudicator did  not  take  into  account  additional  sums  of  money
      referred to in paragraph 5 of the grounds of appeal.  The sponsor also
      stated in her evidence that she sponsors Thelma's daughter  at  school
      because her mother was unable to do so.

   7. We are satisfied that the claimant is mainly dependent financially  on
      her daughter, Mrs Exon, who is now sponsoring her application to  come
      to the United Kingdom.  The accommodation that is provided by  Thelma,
      whilst going into the reckoning, does not render the  claimant  mainly
      financially dependent upon Thelma.   The  contributions  made  by  the
      sponsor more  than  cover  the  financial  costs  of  maintaining  the
      claimant.  Indeed, it is apparent that the sponsor's contributions act
      as a substantial subsidy to her sister's household.

   8. This is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.  Mr  Warburton,  however,
      on behalf of the claimant, made an additional point.  He  referred  as
      to the Immigration  and  Nationality  Directorate's  IDI,  chapter  8,
      section 6 dealing with dependent relatives.  He drew our attention  to
      paragraph 3.2 entitled Further Guidance:

           "Where the applicant is over the age of  65  detailed  enquiries
           will not be necessary.  However  the  sponsor  should  still  be
           requested to complete a RON112 (sponsorship declaration form)."
      The sponsor completed the required form.

   9. Mr Warburton submits that this indicates that the Home Office adopts a
      more relaxed attitude to the requirements of paragraph 317 in the case
      of relatively elderly dependent relatives.  It does  not,  of  course,
      mean that the requirements of  the  Rules  are  suspended  or  waived.
      Indeed, as appears from paragraph 3.1, case workers  are  reminded  to
      satisfy themselves that the claimant is financially  mainly  dependent
      on  the  relative  present  and  settled  in   the   United   Kingdom.
      Consequently, the Entry Clearance Officer was required to be satisfied
      as to the requirements of paragraph 317.  Nevertheless, in  order  for
      the IDI to have some meaning, we think that the  policy  requires  the
      decision maker to  avoid  an  over-rigorous  approach  when  requiring
      evidence to be produced by the claimant and the sponsor.  We  are  not
      satisfied that the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  Manila  adopted  an
      unreasonable attitude towards the production of  documentary  evidence
      in support of the claim.  In the circumstances,  we  do  not  consider
      that the Entry Clearance Officer acted  in  breach  of  the  procedure
      suggested in the IDI.  The claimant was still required  to  prove  her
      case.  Consequently, we do not consider that the  adjudicator  was  in
      error by not allowing the appeal  because  of  an  alleged  procedural
      irregularity.  Nevertheless, we remain satisfied that the  adjudicator
      came to the wrong overall the conclusion and that this  appeal  should
      be allowed.

Decision:  The claimant's appeal is  allowed.   We  direct  that  the  Entry
Clearance Officer grant the claimant leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  in
the capacity sought.
