                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    (SSHD)  against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Davey
    promulgated on the 28th of December  2018 whereby the judge allowed  Mr
    Butt's appeal against the decision of  the  respondent  to  refuse  the
    appellant's claims based on Private Life under Article 8 of  the  ECHR,
    with  reference  to  paragraph  276B  and  paragraph  322(5)   of   the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

 3. Leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Chalkley on 20 March 2019. Thus the case appeared  before  me  to
    determine whether or not there was a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision.

    Factual background

 4. Mr Butt had entered the United Kingdom on 2  April  2006.  He  had  had
    leave throughout and therefore by December 2016 had  accrued  10  years
    "lawful long residence" in the United Kingdom.

 5. During the period that Mr Butt had been in the United  Kingdom  one  of
    the applications, which he had made, was on 5th August 2010  for  leave
    as a Tier 1  General  Migrant.  In  support  of  that  application  the
    appellant had submitted evidence that his  income  at  that  stage  was
    �43,525.88 p from all sources for the period 23 July 2009  to  11  July
    2010. The alleged income was made up of �23,093.88 p from  Pay  As  You
    Earn employment and �23,223 self-employment.

 6. [The appears to be some  discrepancy  in  the  figures  quoted  by  the
    respondent. The figures set out add up to �46,316.88 p].

 7. By reason of the  income  the  appellant  was  awarded  25  points  for
    previous earnings. To be entitled to the points the  appellant  had  to
    have earnings of between �40,000 - �49,999 for the relevant  year.  The
    appellant required  25  points  in  order  to  achieve  the  80  points
    necessary to satisfy the rule as a Tier 1 General Migrant. As a  result
    of the declared income Mr Butt achieved the  required  points  and  was
    granted leave as a Tier 1 General Migrant.

 8. In response to the present application on 24 May 2017 the SSHD wrote to
    Mr Butt requiring him to complete a tax questionnaire,  part  of  which
    required him to either include a tax summary or SA 302s for  the  years
    that he had been self-employed. As part of that questionnaire  Mr  Butt
    was required to disclose whether or not he had ever needed  to  correct
    or resubmit a tax return.

 9. Mr Butt accepted that he had had to  resubmit  a  tax  return  for  the
    period 2009 to 2010 referred to above. He had resubmitted the tax forms
    in May 2016. The tax returns  originally  submitted  declared  a  total
    income for the period in question of  �20,156  including  �16,768  from
    PAYE employment and �3388 from self-employment. There was  therefore  a
    discrepancy between the income declared to UKVI and  to  HMRC  of  over
    �23,000.

10. If the figure of �20,156 earnings for 2009-10 had been declared to UKVI
    at the time of making the application referred to above  the  appellant
    would have received no points for previous earnings and would not  have
    met the requirements of the rules. Alternatively if the correct figures
    had been declared to HMRC there  would  have  been  an  additional  tax
    liability at that time of over �5423.64 p.

11. It appears that on 12 May 2016 the appellant submitted  a  revised  tax
    calculation for the period 2009-10 showing income received  of  �40,191
    including �16,768 from PAYE employment and �23,423 from self-employment
    thus reflecting an additional �20,035 from self-employment.

12. There is not only a discrepancy on the self-employment earnings  but  a
    discrepancy on the PAYE earnings.

13. In considering the appellant's  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain the respondent relied upon paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration
    Rules in that the appellant had either submitted a false tax return  to
    HMRC or had submitted false information to UKVI.

14. The approach to be taken with regard to issues arising under  paragraph
    322(5) have been set out in the cases of R (on the application of Khan)
    v SSHD (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322 (5)) UKUT 00384 (IAC) and
    Balajigari v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673.

15. The case of Khan from paragraph 32 onwards sets out the approach to  be
    taken to assessing whether paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules is
    engaged. Material in that regard is paragraph 33 of the judgement which
    provides: -

         "33.     It is further the case,  in  my  judgement,  that  for  an
         applicant simply to blame his or her  account  for  an  "error"  in
         relation to the historical tax return will not be the  end  of  the
         matter. Thus, the Secretary of  State  is  entitled  to  take  into
         account that even where an account has made an error,  the  account
         will or should have asked the taxpayer to confirm  the  return  was
         accurate and to sign the tax return and furthermore  the  applicant
         will have known of his or her earnings have  expected  to  pay  tax
         thereon. Thus, in this case the applicant not  pay  tax  of  almost
         �15,000 when he would have expected to do so in  the  Secretary  of
         State is therefore entitled to ask why, put on notice in  this  way
         that something was wrong,  the  "mistake"  had  not  been  remedied
         earlier."

16. The case goes on to indicate that whilst an error by an accountant  may
    be a reason for an applicant to show that he was not dishonest but  was
    careless.  However  in  paragraph  34  judgement   clearly   highlights
    consideration has to be given whether or not there was a genuine  error
    on the part the account whether this is simply an attempt to  pull  the
    wool over their eyes

17. With respect that seems  to  be  the  core  of  the  present  case.  In
    assessing the present case the judge does not have any explanation from
    the previous accountant or acceptance that an error had been  made  and
    how that error arose. As indicated in the case  law  the  Secretary  of
    State was entitled where there was such a discrepancy to consider  that
    it required an explanation. It was for the appellant to explain how the
    error arose. Merely blaming the accountant  was  in  the  circumstances
    insufficient. There needed to be evidence as to how the error arose and
    evidence from the accountant they accepted that the error was theirs.

18. The judge takes into account the approach by HMRC but  that  of  itself
    does not deal  with  how  the  error  arose  in  the  alleged  firm  of
    accountants nor an acceptance by the firm of accountants  that  it  was
    their error. Nor does it seek to analyse the  circumstances.  It  seems
    merely to rely on the fact that HMRC have not imposed any penalty.

19. As identified in the case law there may be many reasons why HMRC do not
    impose a penalty, none of which impinge upon or reflect a view on their
    part of the appellant's  behaviour.  The  judge  in  the  present  case
    appears to be much influenced by his view of why no penalty was imposed
    by HMRC.

20. It was necessary for the judge to look  at  how  the  error  arose  and
    whether there was an explanation for the error  from  the  accountants,
    including correspondence between the accountants and the client to show
    why the error arose. A mere assertion on the part of the appellant that
    it was the fault of his accountants  was  insufficient.  That  is  made
    plain by the guidance in the cases where it is clear that an individual
    has to sign and check their tax returns. The caselaw makes  clear  that
    some explanation is necessary as to why expecting to may  substantially
    greater tax payments an individual signed tax return which they knew or
    should know was clearly incorrect.

21. In the circumstances the judge has failed properly to assess the issues
    in the case specifically those identified the case  law.  I  find  that
    that is a material error of law.

22. The only course is for the matter to  be  returned  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a proper assessment to be made of the issues in the case.

    Notice of Decision

23. I dismiss the appeal on all grounds.
