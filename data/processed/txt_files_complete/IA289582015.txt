For the Appellant:     The Appellant in person
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Moan promulgated on 19 October 2016 in which he dismissed the appeal of
    Mr Amer Bin Saber against a decision of the Secretary of State dated  4
    August 2015 to refuse to vary leave  to  remain  and  to  make  removal
    directions pursuant to  section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.


2.   The Appellant is a citizen of India, born on 5 April  1986.   He  first
    entered the United Kingdom  in  October  2010  pursuant  to  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student visa valid until 25 November 2013.   On  25  November
    2013 he made an application for further leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General)  Student  Migrant.   That  application   was   supported   in
    particular by two documents.  He  provided  a  TOEIC  certificate  from
    Westbridge College in relation to his English language ability dated  6
    November 2013.  He also  provided  a  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies ('CAS') from Cromwell College  of  Information  Technology  and
    Management.


3.   It was not until 4 August 2015 that the  Secretary  of  State  came  to
    make a decision on the Appellant's application.   The  application  was
    refused essentially for two reasons. First, with reference to paragraph
    322(1A) of the Immigration Rules: the Respondent  determined  that  the
    Appellant had used a proxy tester to obtain his TOEIC certificate  from
    Westbridge College and therefore had submitted a  false  document.  The
    application was also refused on the basis that when  the  Secretary  of
    State came to check the register of Tier 4 Sponsors on 4  August  2015,
    Cromwell College was not  listed:  therefore  the  Secretary  of  State
    determined that the Appellant had not submitted a valid CAS.


4.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.  His appeal was heard by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Moan on 6 October 2016  in  Birmingham.   The  Appellant
    appeared in person, as he has done before  me  today,  although  it  is
    apparent from the documents on file  that  at  various  points  in  the
    appeal process he has had  assistance  from  representatives  preparing
    documentation and advancing arguments in writing.


5.   The Appellant gave evidence before the First-tier Tribunal. Judge  Moan
    determined that the reliance by the Secretary  of  State  on  paragraph
    322(1A) was not appropriate.  At paragraph 16 of the decision the Judge
    concluded that the Respondent had not established  that  the  Appellant
    had submitted a fraudulent test certificate.


6.   The Judge went on to  consider  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, in particular those of  paragraph  245ZX,  and  noted  that,  no
    matter the reason, it was nonetheless the case that the Appellant's CAS
    was invalid: to that extent he could not succeed under the  Immigration
    Rules.


7.   I should pause to note in this regard that  although  the  decision  on
    the Appellant's application was made on 4 August 2015 -  and  therefore
    post-dated the amendments to Part  5  of  the  2002  Act  made  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014 on 6 April 2015 - because his application predated
    20 October 2014 the pre-amendment appeal rights were preserved.  Indeed
    this was recognised in the Secretary of State's 'reasons  for  refusal'
    letter.  Those appeal rights included as an available ground of  appeal
    that the decision is not in accordance with the law.


8.   Having rejected the Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge went on to say this at paragraph  22  of  his
    Decision:

         "In usual circumstances a student whose college's licence has  been
         revoked is given a grace period to allow the student to find a  new
         college for his/her studies.  This is Home Office policy as opposed
         to a  legislative  requirement.   This  was  not  afforded  to  the
         Appellant because of the fraud  allegations.   The  Respondent  may
         wish to  consider  as  a  matter  of  procedural  fairness  to  the
         Appellant whether he ought to be given that grace period to find an
         alternative college.  That is a matter for the Respondent."

     Having said that, the  Judge  went  on  to  conclude  the  decision  by
    dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


9.   The focus of the challenge before the Upper Tribunal is in  respect  of
    the  Judge's  observations  at  paragraph  22  of  his  Decision,   and
    specifically  that  the  circumstances  described  by  the  Judge  were
    essentially covered by a line of authority, including in particular the
    case of Patel (revocation of sponsor licence - fairness)  India  [2011]
    UKUT 00211 (IAC) wherein it  was  established  that  the  Tribunal  had
    jurisdiction to allow an appeal because a decision taken on  the  basis
    of an invalid CAS - in circumstances where  the  Appellant  would  have
    been unaware of the invalidity of the CAS by the date of the  Secretary
    of  State's  decision  and  was  not  responsible  for   any   of   the
    circumstances leading to the removal of the Tier  4  sponsor  from  the
    Tier 4 Sponsor Register - on the basis that there  was  an  absence  of
    procedural  fairness  in  determining  the  case  without  allowing  an
    applicant  the  opportunity  of  a  period  of  grace  to  rectify  the
    invalidity of the CAS by obtaining an alternative CAS  from  a  sponsor
    that was currently on the relevant register.


10.  Permission to  appeal  was  granted  on  this  basis  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Davey on 1 March 2017.  On 15 March 2017  the  Secretary
    of State filed a Rule 24  response  acknowledging  the  weight  of  the
    argument identified by Judge  Davey  in  the  grant  of  permission  to
    appeal, and simply inviting the Tribunal to determine the appeal with a
    continuance hearing focusing on whether the Appellant's failure to have
    a valid CAS was due to the loss of the sponsorship status of which  the
    Appellant was innocent of any involvement, and to consider  whether  he
    should therefore benefit from the usual 60 day grace period to  provide
    a new sponsoring letter.


11.  The Appellant's representatives (whom  as  I  have  indicated  are  not
    appearing today but have nonetheless assisted with documentation)  have
    provided a brief response to the Rule 24  response  by  way  of  letter
    dated 10 April 2017. Amongst other things it is said "at  no  time  did
    the  Respondent  allege  that  the  Sponsor  was  removed  due  to  any
    wrongdoing by the Appellant".


12.  Mr Kotas before me today helpfully and realistically does not  seek  to
    put the Secretary of State's case any higher than the careful way it is
    expressed in the Rule 24 response, and takes  no  issue  with  what  is
    asserted on the Appellant's  behalf  with  regard  to  there  being  no
    allegation that he was involved  in  the  reason  for  the  removal  of
    Cromwell College from the Sponsor Register.


13.  In those circumstances it is now  common  ground  before  me  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge should be set aside  and  the
    decision in the appeal re-made; further, that in re-making the decision
    the Tribunal should now acknowledge that the decision of the  Secretary
    of State of 4 August 2015 was not in accordance with the law because of
    procedural unfairness  in  that  the  Appellant  was  not  afforded  an
    opportunity to rectify the invalidity of the CAS.  I make that decision
    accordingly.


14.  The effect is that the Appellant's  application  of  25  November  2013
    remains outstanding before the Secretary of State,  and  it  is  to  be
    anticipated  that  in  the  usual  way  the  Secretary  of  State  will
    communicate with the Appellant affording him a 60 day period  of  grace
    in which he may seek to obtain a further CAS, if that is his wish.


Notice of Decision

15.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error of law.


16.  The decision in the appeal is re-made.  The appeal is  allowed  to  the
    limited extent that the decision was not in accordance  with  the  law.
    The Appellant's application remains outstanding before the Secretary of
    State.


17.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.
