For the Appellant:     Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Salmon, Bradford Law Centre


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent and to the  respondent
    as the appellant (as they appeared respectively before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal).  The appellant, Kahin Abdurahman, was born on 1 January 1982
    and is a male citizen of Somalia.  He arrived in the United Kingdom  in
    December 2005 and applied for asylum in January  2006.   The  appellant
    was refused asylum by a decision of the respondent dated 15 May 2015 he
    appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Shimmin)  which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 5 September 2016, allowed the appeal on  asylum
    and human rights (Articles 2 and 3) grounds but  also  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds.  The Secretary of State now appeals, with  permission  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 2. I find that the judge has erred in law such that his decision falls  to
    be set aside.  I shall consider first the  asylum  appeal.   The  judge
    accepted the evidence of two witnesses who told him that the  appellant
    was a member of the minority Bandhabow clan. At [46] the  judge  wrote,
    "I accept in this asylum submission at the time the appellant  came  to
    the UK and up until relatively recently, Somali nationals who establish
    themselves as being from a minority clan such as the  Bandhabow,  would
    be granted asylum."  The judge appears to accept  that  the  mere  fact
    that the appellant may be a member of the Bandhabow tribe, did not,  at
    the date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, entitle him  to
    refugee status.  However, as the grounds assert, the  judge's  analysis
    is not clear.  He moved on from the observation  which  I  have  quoted
    above to consider the length of time  which  the  appellant  has  spent
    living in the United Kingdom (apparently in excess of ten years).   The
    judge found at [51] that the respondent had "failed to comply with  the
    policy set out in the guidance [in  accordance  with  instructions  and
    guidance - 53.1 exceptional circumstances]".  The judge then deals with
    the appellant's "ten years' lawful residence" before concluding with an
    analysis of Article 8.  Finally  at  [71]  the  judge  claimed  through
    analysis of Article 3 ECHR  referring  to  MOJ  (return  to  Mogadishu)
    Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 (IAC) in particular headnote (xii):

         "(xii)   The evidence indicates clearly that it is not simply those
         who originate from Mogadishu that may now generally return to  live
         in the city without being subjected to an  Article  15(c)  risk  or
         facing a real risk of destitution. On the other hand, relocation in
         Mogadishu for a person of a minority clan  with no former links  to
         the city, no access to funds and no other form of clan,  family  or
         social support is unlikely to be realistic as, in  the  absence  of
         means to establish a  home  and  some  form  of  ongoing  financial
         support there will be a real risk of having no alternative  but  to
         live in makeshift accommodation within an IDP camp where there is a
         real possibility of having to live in conditions   that  will  fall
         below acceptable humanitarian standards."

 3. The judge found that the appellant would find himself living in an  IDP
    camp  where  conditions  would  "be   below   acceptable   humanitarian
    standards."

 4. I agree with the Secretary of State that the judge  has  not  completed
    his analysis of the appellant's asylum appeal.  Insofar as he has found
    that the appellant's minority clan membership did not  entitle  him  to
    refugee status, he has made an accurate finding.  However,  it  is  not
    clear to me how the judge's finding as to the appellant's minority clan
    membership has informed the outcome of the asylum  appeal.   The  judge
    has addressed a number of matters (minority  clan  membership;  lengthy
    residence in the United Kingdom; the  Secretary  of  State's  delay  in
    dealing with the appellant's appeal) but has not clearly indicated  how
    these matters inter relate.  It is important than any  decision  should
    be supported by cogent reasons which explain to the  losing  party  why
    the judge had reached a particular decision.  I find that that  is  not
    the case with this decision.

 5. Secondly, I find that the judge has failed  to  refer  himself  to  the
    correct parts of the country guidance contained in MOJ.  I accept  that
    the appellant has not been in Somalia for quite a long time but he  did
    come  from  Mogadishu;  he  would  therefore  not  be  "relocating"  to
    Mogadishu upon his return.  Headnote  sub-paragraph  (xii)  deals  with
    those returnees who do not originate from Mogadishu.  The appellant did
    not  fall  into  that  category.   The  judge  should  have   addressed
    subparagraph (ix):

         "ix) If it is accepted that a person facing a return  to  Mogadishu
         after a period of absence has no nuclear family or close  relatives
         in the city to assist him in  re-establishing  himself  on  return,
         there  will  need  to  be  a  careful  assessment  of  all  of  the
         circumstances. These  considerations  will  include,  but  are  not
         limited to:

         �    circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

         �    length of absence from Mogadishu;

         �    family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

         �    access to financial resources;

         �    prospects of securing a livelihood, whether that be employment
         or self employment;

         �    availability of remittances from abroad;

         �    means of support during the time spent in the United Kingdom;

         �    why his ability to fund the journey  to  the  West  no  longer
         enables an appellant to secure financial support on return.

 6. The judge has failed  to  consider  the  questions  contained  in  sub-
    paragraph (ix) so again his analysis is incomplete.

 7.  Finally,  as  regards  Article  8  the  judge  has  clearly   attached
    significant weight to the fact that the appellant had (in his  opinion)
    lived lawfully in the United Kingdom for ten years (see paragraph  276B
    of HC 395).  The judge made a finding [52]  that  the  appellant  would
    have been granted  temporary  admission  upon  arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  I accept that the finding was made without any  reference  to
    the material before the Tribunal and without giving the respondent  any
    opportunity to respond.  As the grounds point out, the appellant cannot
    appeal in respect of Rule 276B following the amendment to Section 82 of
    the 2002 Act.  In any event, the appellant could not satisfy  paragraph
    276 as he had not been granted leave to enter or remain  assuming  that
    he was ever granted temporary admission  in  the  first  instance  (see
    paragraph 276A(b)(ii)).

 8. The judge has clearly felt some sympathy for the  appellant  given  the
    length of time that he has waited for his appeal to be dealt with.   It
    was also unfortunate that this is not the first time  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal has had to consider the appellant's  appeal;  an  earlier
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal was  set  aside  by  order  of
    Upper Tribunal Judge  Hemingway  by  a  decision  dated  17  May  2016.
    However, I find that the Secretary of State has  established  that  the
    judge has misdirected himself as to relevant country guidance and  that
    his analysis of  the  appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds  is  flawed
    Further, the reasoning supporting the asylum decision is not clear  for
    the reasons which I have given above.  Accordingly,  I  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  None  of  the  findings  of  fact
    shall stand.  It is important  that  a  new  fact-finding  exercise  is
    carried out and that the relevant country guidance applied.  An  appeal
    cannot be allowed under the Immigration  Rules  although  (as  the  law
    currently stands) the appellant's ability to comply with the Rules  may
    be of relevance in any appeal on human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
     In the circumstances, I return the appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (not Judge Shimmin or Judge Wilson) for that  Tribunal  to  remake  the
    decision.

Notice of Decision

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  which  was  promulgated  on  5
    September 2016 is set aside.  None of the findings of fact shall stand.
     The appeal is returned to the First-tier Tribunal (not  Judges  Wilson
    or Shimmin) for that Tribunal to remake the decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
