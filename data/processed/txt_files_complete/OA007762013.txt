For the Respondent:    Ali Ahmed Gulam Mohamad Tapkirwala (the Sponsor)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This appeal came before me following a grant of permission  to  appeal
      on 28 March 2014 against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Landes who, by  a  determination  promulgated  on  31  December  2013,
      allowed the respondent's appeal brought before the First-tier Tribunal
      against the refusal to grant her entry to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
      spouse.

2.    At the hearing, Mr Smart  confirmed  that  Ms  Mehri  had  since  been
      issued with a visa and had entered the United Kingdom. Accordingly  he
      wished to withdraw the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

3.    Rule  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provides for a party to withdraw its case before the  Upper  Tribunal,
      with the consent of the Tribunal. That consent is now given.

4.    The effect of the withdrawal is that the decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal is unchallenged and shall stand.

DECISION

5.    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. The decision to allow the appeal stands.
