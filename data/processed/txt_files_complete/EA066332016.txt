                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge Siddiqi of the First-
    tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 3rd April 2017.

 2. The Appellant is a male Nigerian citizen born 2nd February  1982.   His
    application for a permanent residence card  was  refused  on  17th  May
    2016.  The Appellant had been granted a residence card as a  result  of
    his marriage to the Sponsor on 30th November 2010.

 3. The Respondent did not accept that the Sponsor  had  been  a  qualified
    person between November 2010 and 26th June 2015.  It was  not  accepted
    that the Sponsor was exercising treaty rights at the time  of  divorce.
    In addition the Respondent pointed out that the Appellant had served  a
    six month prison sentence, and therefore this time could not be counted
    as residency in accordance  with  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006.

 4. The appeal was heard by the FtT on 10th March 2017.  The  FtT  did  not
    accept that the Sponsor had been a qualified person  by  way  of  self-
    employment.  The FtT found that insufficient documentary  evidence  had
    been submitted to prove this.

 5. In the alternative, if it was found that the  Sponsor  had  been  self-
    employed, the FtT found that her earnings were so low that her economic
    activities should be regarded as purely marginal  and  ancillary.   The
    FtT considered the principles on this issue in  Begum  Pakistan  [2011]
    UKUT 00257 (IAC).  The FtT found that because the  self-employment  was
    marginal and ancillary,  the  Sponsor  could  not  be  described  as  a
    qualified person as defined by regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations.

 6. The third reason given by the FtT for dismissing the appeal was that it
    had not been proved that the Sponsor was exercising  treaty  rights  in
    the UK at the date of divorce in June 2015.

 7. Following dismissal of the appeal the Appellant applied for  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  In summary it was contended that  the
    FtT had erred by failing "to  give  due  credence  to  the  Appellant's
    evidence."  It was submitted that the FtT had erred  by  not  accepting
    that the Sponsor had been self-employed, and it was  pointed  out  that
    she had submitted business accounts, and evidence from HMRC.

 8. It was contended that the FtT had erred by assessing the Sponsor's self-
    employment by referring to the net profit, which the FtT  described  at
    paragraph 21 as not exceeding �2 per week since 2010.  It was contended
    that the 2006 Regulations do not  distinguish  between  a  small  scale
    enterprise and a large scale venture when considering the  exercise  of
    treaty rights.  It was sufficient for the Sponsor to show that she  had
    been engaged in economic activity, and the FtT  had  erred  by  finding
    otherwise.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge O'Garro and I set  out  below
    paragraph 3 of the grant of permission which provides the  reasons  for
    granting permission to appeal;

         "3.  At paragraph 21  the  judge  found  that  the  profit  of  the
             Appellant's Sponsor's self-employed  business  were  (sic)  so
             small that he found her activities were  purely  marginal  and
             ancillary and concluded from that she was not  a  worker.   In
             light  of  the  guidance  given  in  Begum  (EEA -  worker -
             jobseeker) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00275 (IAC) where the Tribunal
             held that when deciding whether an EEA national  is  a  worker
             for the purposes of the EEA regulations, regard must be had to
             the fact that the term has a meaning in EU law, that  it  must
             be interpreted broadly and that it is not conditioned  by  the
             type of employment or the amount  of  income  derived,  it  is
             arguable that an error of law was made by  the  judge  in  the
             test he applied in reaching his decision."

10. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008.  In summary  it  was  contended  that  the  FtT  directed  itself
    appropriately.  Notwithstanding the findings at paragraph 21 of the FtT
    decision, adequate reasons had been given in paragraphs 17 and  18  for
    finding that the evidence failed to demonstrate that  the  Sponsor  was
    exercising treaty rights at  the  relevant  time.   In  any  event  the
    Respondent noted that the FtT finding in paragraph 22 that the  Sponsor
    had not been exercising treaty rights at the date of  divorce  had  not
    been challenged and therefore the appeal could not succeed.

11. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the FtT had erred in law  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

12. Miss Bremang relied upon the grounds upon which  permission  to  appeal
    had been granted.  She submitted that the  FtT  had  erred  in  law  by
    failing to accept that evidence had been submitted to  prove  that  the
    Sponsor was self-employed.  In addition the FtT had erred by failing to
    take into account the principles in Begum and had erred in finding that
    the Sponsor's income from self-employment was marginal and ancillary.

13. Evidence had been before the FtT  to  prove  that  the  Sponsor  was  a
    qualified person exercising treaty rights at the date of divorce,  that
    evidence being an HMRC self-assessment statement dated 2nd  March  2016
    contained at page 38 of the Appellant's bundle, and the FtT  had  erred
    in law by not taking this into account.

14. Mr Bates relied upon the rule 24 response.  He submitted that the judge
    had taken into account all relevant evidence and was entitled  to  find
    that it had not been proved  that  the  Sponsor  was  self-employed  as
    claimed.

15. It  was  further  submitted  that  it  was  open  to  the  FtT  in  the
    alternative, to find that the self-employment  produced  such  a  small
    income that the description marginal and ancillary  was  apt,  and  the
    Sponsor was not a qualified person by reason of that self-employment.

16. Finally it was submitted that the FtT at paragraph 22 had been entitled
    to find that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the  Sponsor
    was a qualified person at the date of divorce.

17. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

18. I consider firstly the challenge to the FtT  decision,  which  contends
    that the FtT erred in not accepting that the Sponsor was  self-employed
    and therefore a qualified person pursuant to regulation 6 of  the  2006
    Regulations.  The FtT in paragraph 5 set out  the  correct  burden  and
    standard of proof.  I find that the FtT considered and engaged with all
    the evidence before it.

19. The FtT considered and analysed the evidence in paragraphs 17  and  18.
    The FtT noted that the Sponsor did not have a  business  bank  account.
    It was noted that there was a lack of receipts  in  relation  to  items
    purchased for the Sponsor's business.  The  FtT  noted  that  only  one
    receipt was produced at page 113 of the Appellant's bundle, dated  10th
    March 2010.  The FtT noted that the Sponsor's personal bank account did
    not indicate payments or receipts in  relation  to  the  claimed  self-
    employment.

20. The FtT accepted that some invoices had been produced but observed that
    no evidence had been provided to show how or when  these  invoices  had
    been paid.  It was noted that the Sponsor had registered with HMRC  and
    submitted tax returns but that no tax had been paid.  The accounts that
    had been prepared appeared to be unaudited.  The FtT  could  also  have
    mentioned that there was no evidence submitted to prove  that  rent  or
    rates were paid in relation to  business  premises  although  there  is
    reference to these payments in the accounts.

21. I consider that the FtT took into account all  the  evidence  produced,
    and did not fail to consider any material evidence,  and  the  FtT  was
    entitled to conclude that it was not satisfied that it had been  proved
    that the Sponsor had been residing in the UK as a self-employed  person
    under regulation 6 of the 2006  Regulations.   The  grounds  display  a
    disagreement with the  conclusion  reached  by  the  FtT,  but  do  not
    disclose a material error of law.

22. Secondly I consider the FtT finding that the  income  received  by  the
    Sponsor was so small as to be regarded as marginal and ancillary.  This
    was an alternative finding, which strictly speaking was not  necessary,
    as the FtT had made a primary finding that the Sponsor's  self-employed
    status had not been proved.  However, I do not find that the FtT  erred
    in law.  Net profits of the Sponsor were claimed to be �3,615 over five
    years, and in my view it  was  open  to  the  FtT  to  find  the  self-
    employment to be marginal and ancillary, and I do not accept  that  the
    FtT failed to consider the principles in Begum.

23. Thirdly, I do not find that the FtT  erred  in  law  in  concluding  at
    paragraph 22  that  it  had  not  been  proved  that  the  Sponsor  was
    exercising treaty rights at the date of  divorce  in  June  2015.   The
    document relied upon by the Appellant as proving  the  Sponsor's  self-
    employment at the date of  divorce  is  the  self-assessment  statement
    dated 2nd March 2016.  This does not prove self-employment as  at  June
    2015.  This document indicates  that  the  only  payment  made  by  the
    Sponsor to HMRC was �106.60 on 6th August 2012.  There was a  balancing
    payment due for the tax year 2014/15 of �82.40 and that relates to  the
    tax year ending April 2015.

24. The FtT made findings open to it on the evidence, and provided adequate
    reasons for  those  findings  in  accordance  with  the  principles  in
    Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC).

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT does not disclose  a  material  error  of  law.  The
decision is not set aside and the appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

The FtT did not make an anonymity direction.  There has been no request  for
anonymity made to the Upper Tribunal and I see no need to make an  anonymity
order.
