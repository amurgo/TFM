For the Respondents:   Mr S Unigwe, Counsel instructed on behalf of S L A
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Metzer)  who,  in  a   determination
    promulgated on 19th November 2014  allowed  the  appeals  against  the
    Respondent's decision to refuse to grant them entry  clearance  as  the
    daughter and grandson of an EEA national exercising treaty  rights  and
    therefore qualifying  as  family  members  of  an  EEA  national  under
    Regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations 2006.

 2. Whilst this is an appeal brought by the Secretary of State, I intend to
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. On 17th October 2013 the  Appellants,  who  are  citizens  of  Nigeria,
    sought entry clearance as the family members of  an  EEA  national  but
    were refused in notices of  immigration  decision  dated  1st  November
    2013.  In respect of the First Appellant it  was  noted  that  she  had
    applied for admission under the EEA Regulations as a direct  descendant
    of the Sponsor, her mother, but the  documentation  submitted  did  not
    satisfactorily evidence that  she  was  wholly  or  mainly  financially
    dependent on the Sponsor.  In the alternative, if she was, that  was  a
    dependency of necessity rather than choice and it was  noted  that  she
    was employed as a research assistant and therefore the Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that she needed the financial support of  the
    Sponsor to meet the essential needs.  Thus he was not satisfied she met
    the Regulations to qualify as a family member of  an  EEA  national  in
    accordance with Regulation 7 of the EEA  Regulations  2006.   A  second
    reason was given also that on the basis  that  the  Appellant  had  not
    provided satisfactory evidence that she and the Sponsor were related as
    claimed.  In respect of the Second Appellant it was noted that  he  had
    failed to provide satisfactory evidence that he was the  grandchild  of
    an EEA national and thus his application was also refused.

 4. The Appellants issued grounds of appeal leading to the  hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Metzer)  on  3rd  November  2014.   He
    recorded at [2] that the issues had been narrowed as the second  ground
    raised for refusing the First Appellant's application on the  basis  of
    the failure to demonstrate she was related to the Sponsor and that  was
    the main ground also in respect of the Second Appellant, had been dealt
    with by the provision of DNA test results.  Thus the judge  found  that
    the relationship between the Sponsor and the two  Appellants  had  been
    established and the sole issue requiring determination was the issue of
    financial support.

 5. The judge had the opportunity of considering and hearing  the  evidence
    of the Sponsor which he recorded at paragraphs  [3]  and  [6].   It  is
    plain from reading the determination that the Secretary  of  State  was
    not represented during that  hearing  and  no  Presenting  Officer  was
    present to conduct the appeal.

 6.  The  judge  set  out  the  findings  at  paragraphs  8  to  9  of  the
    determination.  He concluded at [9] that in respect  of  the  financial
    support and applying the Upper Tribunal authorities of Lim [2013]  UKUT
    00437 at paragraphs 21 and 22 and Reyes [2013] UKUT 00314 at  paragraph
    19 that dependency is a matter of choice on the basis that there is  no
    abuse of rights and that he therefore did not follow the basis  of  the
    refusal which made reference  to  the  financial  dependency  upon  the
    Sponsor being "a dependency of  necessity  rather  than  choice".   The
    judge found that to be inconsistent with the case law but in any  event
    found that the Sponsor had:

         "Materially contributed to the financial support of the  Appellants
         and that the Appellants would not be able  to  manage  without  the
         assistance of the Sponsor.  In the circumstances, I find  that  the
         Sponsor has insured that the Appellants' essential needs in Nigeria
         are met and in all the circumstances, I find  the  Appellants  have
         established to the relevant standard that they are  family  members
         of an EEA national exercising rights of  free  movement  under  the
         Treaty of Rome in the United Kingdom  bearing  in  mind  the  clear
         evidence of the Sponsor's nationality, her earnings,  and  evidence
         of employment and evidence of money transactions sent to assist the
         Appellants."

 7. Therefore he allowed the appeals under the Regulations.

 8. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal and  permission  was
    granted on 9th January 2015 by Judge Landes.

 9. Before the Tribunal Miss Holmes relied upon the grounds submitting that
    the judge failed to have sufficient regard to the issue of  dependency.
    She made reference to the Entry Clearance Manager's review and that the
    money that the First Appellant had received by way of a  salary  was  a
    large amount in Nigeria and that the Appellants were required  to  show
    with evidence that money was being provided for their essential  needs.
    This was not clear in the determination.  By reference to the  decision
    of Reyes (as previously cited)  it  was  submitted  that  the  test  of
    dependency is a factual test and that the question of dependency should
    not be reduced to a bare calculation of financial dependency but should
    be construed to involve a holistic examination of a number  of  factors
    to establish whether the dependence is genuine (see paragraph 19).  She
    also made reference to paragraph 21 of that decision in  which  it  was
    stated that the assessment of dependency was to consider whether it was
    to meet their essential living needs.  She submitted that this had  not
    been done in the determination and it was not known whether the sums of
    money  that  were  sent  were  for  essential  living  needs  or   not.
    Consequently  she  submitted  the  grounds  were  made  out   and   the
    determination should be set aside.

10. Mr Unigwe on behalf of the Appellants observed that  the  Secretary  of
    State had failed to send a representative to the hearing and  therefore
    they had chosen not to  cross-examine  the  Sponsor  who  had  provided
    evidence before the judge and it was plain that the judge accepted that
    evidence.  He referred the Tribunal to  the  decision  of  Lim  (EEA  -
    dependency) [2013] UKUT 00437 and that  the  EEA  Regulations  did  not
    define the notion or concept of dependency and that  it  was  dependent
    upon the judicial interpretation of that and in  this  case  the  judge
    found that the Appellants had satisfied the issue  of  dependency.   He
    stated that the fact that the First Appellant had  employment  did  not
    preclude the Appellant  being  in  receipt  of  other  money  that  was
    provided for her essential needs.  He made reference to paragraph 21 of
    Lim where Lord Justice Goldring in Pedro stated  that  whether  someone
    had the status of a dependent family member was a question of fact  and
    that such a status was "characterised by the material support for  that
    family member provided by the union national who has exercised his free
    right of movement.   Why  the  family  member  is  dependent  does  not
    matter."  He reminded the Tribunal of paragraph 22 of Lim that the only
    qualification that the Court of Justice has ever made to this principle
    is that there must not be an abuse of rights and thus the jurisprudence
    clearly allowed for a dependency of choice.  At paragraph 24 of Lim, it
    stated that "for dependency to arise it is not necessary that a  person
    be wholly or even mainly dependent.   If  a  person  requires  material
    support for essential needs in part, that is sufficient."

11. Therefore Mr Unigwe, submitted that it was open to the judge  to  reach
    the conclusion  on  the  evidence  before  him  based  on  the  witness
    statement which had been adopted as her  evidence  that  she  had  sent
    money for the upkeep of both Appellants (see paragraph 5).  It was  not
    necessary for the judge to set out the costs for rent and food but  the
    judge had relied properly upon the evidence that was before  him  which
    he accepted fully that she did not earn enough money to pay  for  their
    essential needs including school fees and other needs set  out  in  the
    witness  statement  and  that  the  financial  support  was  necessary.
    Paragraph 9 of the judge's determination set out his findings that  the
    Appellants were not able to manage without that  financial  assistance.
    The documents provided evidence of those money transfers.   Thus  there
    was no error of law.

12. I reserved my determination.

13. In the light of  the  DNA  evidence  that  had  been  provided  by  the
    Appellants which demonstrated their relationship with the Sponsor,  the
    sole issue  remaining  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  of
    dependency.  The Sponsor in  respect  of  this  issue  had  provided  a
    witness statement dated 3rd November 2014  and  produced  a  number  of
    documents  within  the  Appellants'  bundle  including  money  transfer
    orders.  In her evidence she confirmed that she  was  an  EEA  national
    exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom as a worker and produced
    evidence of that employment namely as a carer with an average income of
    over �12,000 per year.  She enclosed her payslips, her bank  statements
    and her P60 and also her contract of employment.   She had demonstrated
    that she had suitable and sufficient accommodation for  the  Appellants
    should entry clearance be granted (paragraph 6).

14.   As regards to the issue of dependency, the evidence  of  the  Sponsor
    recorded by the judge at [4] was that whilst the  first  appellant  had
    worked in Nigeria, she was not earning sufficiently well  and  received
    �220 per month.  In view of that, the evidence of the Sponsor was  that
    she sent an average of �200 per month and the money  was  utilised  for
    their general upkeep (living needs), school  fees  and  other  relevant
    expenditure.

15. It is plain from reading the determination that  the  judge  found  the
    Sponsor to be a credible witness and had considered her evidence in the
    light of the documents.  There was no evidence before the judge to show
    that the position set out in the Sponsor's evidence  and  given  before
    him was either wrong or in  error.   In  those  circumstances,  it  was
    entirely open to the judge to reach his  findings  of  fact  upon  that
    unchallenged evidence.

16.  Whilst the grounds assert that the judge failed to give  any  adequate
    reasons, I do not find that that is the case.  At paragraph  9  of  his
    determination the judge properly  had  regard  to  the  relevant  legal
    authorities relating to  the  issue  of  dependency  and  made  a  self
    direction to the cases of Lim and Reyes.  He properly  identified  that
    the basis  of  the  refusal  which  had  made  reference  to  financial
    dependency upon the Sponsor being "a  dependency  of  necessity  rather
    than choice" was  inconsistent  with  the  case  law  and  indeed  both
    advocates before me agree that the judge was entirely correct to  reach
    that view.  Those decisions make it plain that when  determining  if  a
    family member is  dependent  on  the  relevant  EEA  national  for  the
    purposes  of  the  EEA  Regulations,  financial  dependency  should  be
    interpreted as meaning that the person needs financial support to  meet
    his or her essential needs.  In those circumstances it does not  matter
    that the applicant may in addition receive financial support from other
    sources.  In this case the Entry Clearance Officer  made  reference  to
    the income that the First Appellant received from  her  employment.   I
    observe that the Entry Clearance Manager stated  that  the  Appellant's
    monthly wage which although modest by UK standard is  anything  but  in
    Nigeria, but he did  not  provide  any  evidence  in  support  of  that
    statement.  The judge considered the evidence before him in  the  light
    of those two authorities  and  reached  the  conclusion  that  on  that
    evidence that the Sponsor had materially contributed to  the  financial
    support of the Appellants and that the Appellants would not be able  to
    manage without the assistance  of  the  Sponsor.   He  found  that  the
    Sponsor had ensured that the Appellants'  essential  needs  in  Nigeria
    were met  and  in  the  circumstances  found  that  the  Appellant  had
    established that they are family members of an EEA national  exercising
    treaty rights.

17.  It is plain from reading paragraph 9 that those findings  were  firmly
    evidence based as he went on to state that that was based on the "clear
    evidence of the Sponsor's nationality, her  earnings  and  evidence  of
    employment and evidence  of  money  transactions  sent  to  assist  the
    Appellants."  In the findings that he had earlier made he accepted that
    whilst the First Appellant had worked in Nigeria she  was  not  earning
    sufficient money and received in addition to her salary  the  �200  per
    month from the Sponsor which was used  for  both  her  and  the  Second
    Appellant's upkeep, school fees and other expenditure.  It  is  further
    plain by reading paragraphs [4] and[ 9] together that the  judge  found
    that the additional money that was being  sent  by  way  of  the  money
    transactions, which were evidenced in the papers, were sent to meet the
    essential needs which he considered were there for their upkeep, school
    fees and other expenditure.

18. In those circumstances the judge gave adequate reasons for reaching the
    conclusion that the Appellants had established to the relevant standard
    that they are the family members  of  an  EEA  national  and  in  those
    circumstances the grounds do not demonstrate any arguable error of  law
    in the judge's determination.
