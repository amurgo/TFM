                                 DIRECTIONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. This is an appeal by a national of Kuwait where he was  born  in  1983.
    It is against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Heap  who  for
    reasons given in her decision dated 11 April 2019 following  a  hearing
    on 28 March 2019 dismissed the appellant's appeal against the Secretary
    of State's decision refusing his asylum claim which had been made on  7
    June 2018.  The appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 24  January
    2018 via a waiver visa, having had a history of previous visa grants as
    a visitor between 2003 and 2005.


 2. The judge noted the appellant's case at paragraph [5] of  her  decision
    as follows:


         "5.  The Appellant's position as set out in the  Notice  of  Appeal
             which was settled by his then solicitors is that  he  fears  a
             return to Kuwait on the basis of the following matters;


             a.   That there would be a  risk  to  his  health  as  he  was
                  misdiagnosed in Kuwait and was not provided with  adequate
                  treatment for testicular cancer;


             b.   That he would be at risk on the basis that  he  would  be
                  returning as a failed asylum seeker; and


             c.   That he would be at risk as he is wanted for arrest as  a
                  result of a previous court warrant issued over  a  dispute
                  with a rich and powerful opponent who  had  sued  him  and
                  been awarded compensation for a car accident  even  though
                  the Appellant had not been at fault."


 3. The Secretary of State accepted the appellant's nationality and  health
    problems but did not consider he would be at risk as by the appellant's
    own admission he had not suffered any problems of the  complaints  that
    he had made regarding the misdiagnosis.  In relation to the  automobile
    accident the judge recorded the detail of the appellant's claim as  set
    out in the respondent's  refusal  decision  (in  which  the  claim  was
    rejected as one of prosecution rather  than  persecution).   Thereafter
    the judge directed herself as to the relevant law before turning to the
    procedure at the hearing when the appellant  was  unrepresented.   This
    included having to address the appellant's request for video footage to
    be viewed which had  been  in  Arabic  and  for  which  there  were  no
    translations.  The judge also noted aspects of the  way  in  which  the
    interpreter intervened in the appellant giving evidence before  setting
    out her findings of fact between paragraphs [29] and [36].


 4. As to the health issue the judge concluded at [31]:


         "31. The first of those matters is that the Appellant  is  said  to
             fear a return on the basis of his  previous  misdiagnosis  and
             the need for ongoing treatment in  Kuwait.   As  set  out  the
             Decision,  the  Appellant  has  not  claimed   that   he   has
             experienced any persecution or difficulties with regard to the
             Kuwaiti authorities as a result  of  the  complaints  that  he
             apparently  made  regarding  his  misdiagnosis.   Indeed,  his
             evidence was that he had approached the Kuwaiti Embassy in the
             United Kingdom and a member of the Kuwaiti  Royal  family  for
             assistance with his medical treatment which would appear to be
             at  odds  with  his  claim  to  be  in  fear  of  the  Kuwaiti
             authorities  because  of   complaints   made   about   medical
             treatment.   It  is  clear  that  the  real  issue  which  the
             Appellant has is a belief that he will not be able  to  access
             the ongoing medical treatment that he needs in Kuwait or  that
             again that will be somehow deficient.  There is,  however,  no
             evidence to that effect or anything to suggest that there  are
             insufficient treatment options in Kuwait for the Appellant  to
             access."


 5. Thereafter the judge turned  to  the  issue  in  relation  to  the  car
    accident on which she reached the following  conclusions  at  paragraph
    [33]:


         "33. I am not persuaded, even  to  the  lower  standard,  that  the
             Appellant has any form of warrant  issued  for  his  detention
             following non-payment of the sums Order  to  be  paid  by  the
             Court given the fact that he claimed to have evidence of  that
             but has failed at any stage to provide it.  The  closest  that
             the Appellant has got to providing  evidence  was  a  document
             from the Kuwaiti Ministry of Justice in 2014 to put in place a
             travel ban if he did not pay the ï¿½26,625 dinars [sic]  ordered
             to be paid as a result of the  automobile  accident.   Clearly
             that travel ban was not enforced given that the Appellant left
             Kuwait using his own passport.  However, even assuming that it
             was correct that  the  Appellant  has  some  form  of  warrant
             against him, any detention or prosecution  arising  from  that
             does not engage a Convention reason nor is there any  evidence
             that any action taken by the authorities would put him at risk
             of serious harm."


 6. At paragraph 34 the judge explained that the incident did not engage  a
    Convention reason or that it would place the appellant  at  a  risk  of
    serious harm.


 7. Finally, as to the risk the appellant claims that he would  face  as  a
    failed asylum seeker the judge observed at paragraph [35]:


         "35. The third issue is that the Appellant says that  as  a  failed
             asylum seeker he will be at risk  of  persecution  or  serious
             harm on a return to Kuwait.  There is no  evidence  whatsoever
             submitted by the Appellant or by his solicitors at a time when
             they were instructed to show that he is at risk of persecution
             or serious harm simply by virtue of returning to Kuwait  as  a
             failed asylum seeker."


 8. This led the judge to conclude that the appellant had not established a
    well-founded fear on Convention grounds.  She turned to Article  3  and
    explained at paragraph [38]:


         "38. With that in mind, it is then necessary for me to consider  if
             the return of  the  Appellant  in  those  circumstances  would
             breach the Appellant's human rights.   Firstly,  there  is  no
             evidence that there is an absence  of  medical  treatment  for
             cancer in Kuwait and, indeed,  evidence  supplied  within  the
             Respondent's bundle demonstrates that there  is  free  medical
             treatment  for  all  Kuwaiti  nationals.   The  Appellant  has
             clearly  had  some  form  of  poor   experience   and   either
             misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis in Kuwait but that does not
             equate to an unavailability of ongoing treatment now  that  he
             has received a diagnosis.  As the Decision points out, he  can
             take with him evidence of his diagnosis and the treatment that
             he has been receiving and there is no evidence to suggest that
             he would not be able to receive further treatment  in  Kuwait.
             The Appellant may well be mistrustful of medical practitioners
             in Kuwait but that is no different to anyone  in  any  country
             who has had the misfortune to experience  medical  negligence.
             That mistrust does not equate to evidence  of  an  absence  of
             available and sufficient medical treatment."


    And within the same paragraph before concluding that there was  nothing
    to suggest the appellant's circumstances came within the  scope  within
    the scope of N v SSHD [2005] UKHL 31 and AM (Zimbabwe)  v  SSHD  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 64.


 9. The grounds of  appeal  relied  on  by  the  appellant  refers  to  the
    deterioration of human rights in Kuwait particularly the death  penalty
    for non-violent offences had  returned  and  was  reinstated  in  2017.
    Under Sharia law anyone not admitting guilt  under  oath  for  a  crime
    would be judged as guilty.  There was often no jury  or  representation
    for a defendant and it was submitted that  this  presented  a  risk  on
    return.


10. In  granting  permission  to  appeal  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bird
    explained as her reasons:


         "3.   The  appellant  seeks  permission  to  appeal  against   this
             decision.   It is alleged that  the  judge  made  an  arguable
             error of law in finding that an arrest warrant issued  against
             him would not raise a protection need - paragraph 33.


         4.   The judge made findings on this issue which are  supported  by
             adequate reasons.   The  judge  on  the  basis  of  these  was
             entitled to the conclusion he came to.  No arguable  error  of
             law has been made."


11. The appellant was unrepresented but assisted by a court interpreter.  I
    explained to him the tension between the reasons given  by  Judge  Bird
    and the grant of permission.

12. In AS (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ  208  the  Court  of  Appeal
    considered the jurisdiction  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  correct  any
    clerical mistake or accidental slip or omission with reference to  rule
    42 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008.   It  was
    common ground before the court that this rule ("...in common with  slip
    rules applying to other jurisdictions, applies  only  to  what  I  have
    above called "errors of expression".  (per Underhill LJ at [18]).

13. The court further observed at [33]:

         "33. I note in  this  connection  that  rule  31  of  the  Tribunal
             Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration   and   Asylum
             Chamber)  Rules  2014  permits  the  correction  of  "any  ...
             accidental slip or omission in a decision,  direction  or  any
             document produced by it". Whatever "decision" might  cover  if
             it stood alone, the italicised words appear to put  it  beyond
             doubt that the power extends to the written  reasons  for  any
             decision. The TPC  thus  regarded  it  as  desirable  in  that
             context that the slip rule should not  be  limited  to  formal
             decisions.  It would be odd, to put it no higher, if  we  were
             to give rule 42 a  construction  which  produced  a  different
             result in the Upper Tribunal."


    Before holding at [35]:

         "35. I would for those reasons hold that  the  Upper  Tribunal  has
             power under rule 42 to correct  clerical  mistakes  and  other
             accidental slips or omissions not only in its formal decisions
             but in its reasons for those decisions."


14. The court referred to the Tribunal decision  in  Katsonga  [2016]  UKUT
    00228 (IAC) but that citation was qualified in note 7 as follows:

         "Note 7   My citation of Katsonga should not be taken  as  implying
         approval of the proposition in the judicially-drafted headnote that
         "the 'Slip Rule'... cannot be used  to  reverse  the  effect  of  a
         decision", which if taken out of context may  be  misleading.   If,
         say, a "not"  were  accidentally  omitted  from  a  declaration  or
         injunction its correction might well reverse what  would  otherwise
         be the effect of the decision, but it is hard to see why it  should
         for that reason be illegitimate: indeed it might be thought  to  be
         the paradigm of the kind of  case  for  which  the  slip  rule  was
         required."


15. In my judgment in the light of the clear disconnect between the reasons
    given by Judge Bird  and  the  decision  to  grant  permission,  it  is
    appropriate for her to consider whether to apply the slip  rule  which,
    if applied, would mean the Upper  Tribunal  no  longer  had  continuing
    jurisdiction.

16. Accordingly this appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  its
    consideration under rule 31 of the First-tier Tribunal Rules 2014.
